“Robinson CRUsor,” says Marmontel, “is
the first book I ever read with exquisite
pleasure—and I believe every boy in Europe
might say the same thing.” Next indeed to
the Holy Scriptures, it may safely be asserted,
that this delightful Romance has, cver since
it was written, exerted the first and most
powerful influence upon the juvenile mind
of England — nor has its popularity been
much less among any of the other nations
of Christendom. At a period when few of
the productions of English genius had been
transferred into any of the languages of
foreigners, this masterpiece of the homely,
unaffected, unpretending, but rich and mas-
culine intellect of Daniel Defoe, had already
acquired, in every cultivated tongue of
Europe, the full privileges of a native work.
Although abounding in all the prejudices of

his countrymen, even in those confined to
the humbler orders of his countrymen, the
nationality of Defoe's notions formed no
obstacle to his acceptance abroad; because
it did not interfere in any way with the effect
of his broad and sure pictures of human
nature ; his unfailing appeals to the ele-
mental workings of the human mind; his
mastery over the universal passions; the
sagacity, finally, and the deep wisdom of
those views of human character and con-
duct, which in Robinson Crusoe more suc-
cessfully than in any production of the same
captivating species, are made to display
themselves in the apparently artless conca-
tenation of the incidents of a fictitious
narrative, and the developement of one
imaginary individual’s mind. The work,
indeed, requires only to be made known
among nations the most remote from us and
our manners, in order to its receiving among
them the same unanimous testimony of ap-
probation. In the course of those laborious
years which the late enlightened and enter-
prising traveller Burckhardt devoted to the
study of the Arabic language in Syria and
Egypt, we find that he amused and improved
himself by rendering into that dialect a great

part of this Romance. While he was com-
posing it, he used to read passages of his
work to his Arab friends, when they came to
sit at his gate in the cool hours of evening :
and the most learned and the most ignorant
of them, says he, expressed equal delight
and admiration. The most bigoted lovers
of oriental literature could not help con-
fessing, that The Frankish Storyteller had
afforded them as much amusement as the
historian of Sinbad, without ever having
recourse to any thing in the smallest degree
improbable, and without ever writing one
sentence less pregnant with instruction than
with amusement.
Defoe was a man of no small consequence
among his own contemporaries, long before
he wrote Robinson Crusoe ; and his chief
fame, even during the after part of his life,
was far from depending chiefly on this
masterpiece; but it may be doubted if, but
for it, his name would have occupied any
considerable space in the literary history of
his country. His poetry, which made great
noise in his own time, is now almost entirely
unknown: and indeed it scarcely deserves a
better fate; for although a few passages of
fine conception may be found, these are only
a 2
rari mantes in gurgite vasto of more than
prosaic dullness. His ear, moreover, appears
to have been most unmusical, for although
he wrote while Dryden's fame was at its full,
and witnessed also the developement of the
genius of Pope, his versification is through-
out harsh and irregular, scarcely reaching
unless in a few casual lines, beyond the ex-
cellence of that of John Dunton. The sub-
jects of his poetical compositions are not
such as of themselves to invite perpetuity of
attention. The politics of Swift are kept
alive by his wit: but the poetry of Defoe
cannot embalm his praises of King William,
or his vituperations of the doctrine of Jus
Divinum. Some of his political tracts in
prose, and above all his History of the Union
of Great Britain, may be well deserving of
more attention than is now generally be-
stowed on them; and several of his other
novels are not unworthy of their author's
genius : but unless the memory of these
lesser productions had been sustained by the
splendour of the reputation of Robinson
Crusoe, it is very doubtful whether any of
them would have been found at this day on
any other shelves than those of literary or
historical antiquarians. After all, the great
body of English readers know nothing of any
of Defoe's writings except the first and best
of his romances; and, in general, they know
very little about the personal history of its
author. Their acquaintance with his genius
is formed at that early age, when it is quite
natural and quite easy to get a book by heart
without ever wasting a thought on its merits
or its author. And the habit thus acquired
of considering Robinson Crusoe pretty much
in the light of a thing existing of and by
itself, is insensibly continued by most people
throughout life. Whatever may be the cause,
the fact is certain, that there is no great
English author of whom so little is popularly
known as Daniel Defoe. The industry of
Chalmers, and the judgment of Kippis, have
already collected and arranged all the ma-
terials of his biography; but their lives of
Defoe have appeared in shapes not the most
friendly to their circulation; and for that
reason, the publishers of the present splendid
edition of Robinson Crusoe have judged fit
to prefix some brief notices of its author, in
a form more adapted for the usual readers of
books of amusement.
He was born, as nearly as can be ascer-
tained, in the year 1663, and in all probability
a 3
in London, for his father was James Foe, a
butcher, of the parish of St. Giles, Cripple-
gate. His family were protestant dissenters,
and he, through life adhered to the same
persuasion. “A dissenter,” he himself says,
“I am, but no independent fifth-monarchy
man or leveller.” His father seems to have
early discovered the superiority of young
Daniel's talents, for he placed him under the
care of Mr. Charles Morton, of Newington
Green, a distinguished teacher among the
dissenters, in whose house he remained for
several years, at an expense much beyond
what fathers in that humble walk of life were
then in the custom of bestowing on the edu-
cation of their children. In 1705 he was re-
proached with want of letters by his adversary
Tutchin, and thus replied: “I owe this jus-
tice to my ancient father, who is yet living,
and in whose behalf I freely testify, that if I
am a blockhead, it is nobody's fault but my
own; he having spared nothing that might
qualify me to match the accurate Dr. Bently,
or the most learned Tutchin.”
For what particular line of life the butcher
intended to rear his promising son, there is
no ground to conjecture; he himself asserts,
that he never served any apprenticeship; but
it is probable, trade in some shape was his
destination. He was admitted a liveryman
of London, in right of his birth, on the 26th
of January 1687-8, and appeared, if we may
believe Oldmixon, on horseback, and in gallant
attire, among a chosen band of citizens, who
escorted King William from Whitehall to the
Mansion-house, when the monarch was
feasted by the Lord Mayor, on the 29th of
October in the succeeding year. Even before
this period, however, Daniel had distinguished
himself in more ways than one; he wrote a
pamphlet in 1683, to show the absurdity of
leaving the Austrians to be conquered by the
Turks—a line of policy then recommended
by many narrow-minded and short-sighted
protestants; and in 1685 he quitted the pa-
ternal mansion, and shared in the unfortunate
insurrection, which terminated in the ruin
and death of the Duke of Monmouth. Defoe,
however, was lucky enough to escape, both
from the dangers of battle, and the blood-
thirstiness of Jefferys, and aided by the ob-
scurity of his appearance and station, regained
his father's roof in safety. From this period
till the Revolution, it is reasonable to
suppose he kept quiet at home; although it
may be suspected his attention to business
a 4
was not quite so great as it should have
been. -
Already he had established himself in trade,
on his own account, and there seems to be no
ground for distrusting the tradition which as-
cribes to him the profession of a hosier. His
wit, whatever was the nature of his shop, car-
ried him too often from the shop to the tavern;
and a manufacture of tiles at Tilbury, in Essex,
in which he had also embarked, was probably
still more neglected. In 1692 his affairs had
fallen into such disorder, that he was obliged
to abscond from his creditors, and a commis-
sion of bankruptcy was taken out against him.
The debts which he had thus contracted, he
however considered himself as in honour
obliged to discharge by his after exertions;
and in 1705 we find him asserting, in answer
to some ungenerous sarcasms of his enemies,
that he had already, by his industry, reduced
a debt of seventeen to less than five thousand
pounds; but in the meantime he was left
without employment or means of professional
subsistence, not having as yet attained thirty
years of age, and known only as he deserved
to be known, to a very few intimate friends.
These appear to have exerted themselves
as became them in his behalf; one gen-
tleman proposed to him to go to Cadiz as
factor to a mercantile house, under very
favourable prospects of success and advance-
ment, but Defoe felt such a reluctance to
leave the soil of England, that he at once
rejected this plan. By the interest of another
he procured the situation of accountant
to the commissioners for managing the
duties on glass, in which he remained for
four years, till the commission was termi-
nated by act of parliament. During these
four years, however, his pen was not idle;
he produced successively many tracts on poli-
tical subjects, and still more on subjects of
commercial policy, which attracted attention,
and increased his reputation. Among these
his Essay on Projects is deserving of no in-
considerable praise. On the subjects of
Bullion, of Banking, and on the propriety
of erecting a Court of Merchants for the
decision of purely mercantile causes, he
made many sagacious remarks which might
be perused with advantage, even by the
statesmen of the present day. His peculiar
vein of satire may be discerned peeping out
here and there, even in the Essay on Pro-
jects. One of his favourite schemes is the
erection of an academy for the education of
women. “A woman well-bred and well-
taught,” says he, “furnished with the
additional accomplishments of knowledge
and behaviour, is a creature without compa-
rison; her society is the emblem of sublimer
enjoyments, her person is angelic, her con-
versation heavenly. She is every way
suitable to the sublimest wish; and the man
that has such a one to his portion, has
nothing to do but to rejoice in her and be
thankful. On the other hand, suppose her
to be the same woman, and rob her of the
benefit of education, and it follows thus: II
her temper be good, want of education
makes her soft and easy. Her wit, for want
of teaching, makes her impertinent and
talkative. Her knowledge, for want of judg-
ment and experience, makes her fanciful and
whimsical. If her temper be bad, want of
breeding makes it worse; and she grows
haughty, insolent, and loud. If she be
passionate, want of manners makes her a
termagant and a scold, which is much at
one with lunatic. If she be proud, want of
discretion (which still is breeding) makes her
conceited, fantastic, and ridiculous. And
from these she degenerates to be turbulent,
clamorous, noisy, nasty, AND THE DEvil.”
Another of the pieces published at this
period, was An Inquiry into the occasional
Conformity of Dissenters in cases of Preferment,
with a preface addressed “To the Lord
Mayor, occasioned by his carrying the sword
to a conventicle.” There is great sincerity,
warmth, and truth in the whole strain of this
pamphlet, and no doubt it must have thrown
the city into a ferment. There is no
answering his principal positions; viz. “that
he who dissents from the established church,
except from a true principle of conscience,
is guilty of a great sin; that he who con-
forms to the established church against his
conscience, is guilty of a great sin; and that
he who both dissents and conforms at the
same time, must be guilty of one of those
great sins.” The Lord Mayor, whose con-
duct in carrying the city regalia to a con-
venticle elicited the attack of Defoe, was
however still more effectually punished by
Swift's sarcasm in the Tale of a Tub, where
JAck is represented as “getting upon a
great horse and eating custard.” The un-
fortunate dignitary's name was Sir Humphry
Edwin : Swift's similitude shews that the
state coach was not then introduced, and
Defoe himself elsewhere alludes to the
equestrian displays of the Chief Magistrate,
“To ride the city horse, and wear the chain.”
A third pamphlet of this period is entitled
“An argument shewing that a standing
army, with consent of parliament, is not
inconsistent with a free government.” A
fourth is “Reasons against a war with
France:” in this the absurdity of rushing into
a war merely because the French king had
allowed to the son of James II. the honorary
title of King of England, is exposed with
much plain sense and well-applied ridicule.
A fifth tract is, “The original power of the
collective body of the people of England
examined and asserted;” a very powerful per-
formance, the main argument of which is as
irresistible as its language is forcible. Those
misguided writers of the present day, who are
continually broaching so many dangerous doc-
trines concerning the mutual relations of the
people and the parliament of England, would
do well to observe with what temperate and
grave delicacy this difficult subject has been
treated by an old whig, and a keen one, in
these masterly pages.
Forgotten as Defoe's poetry now is, it was
however by a poetical performance that he
first attracted the notice of government, and
became a man of consequence in the public
eye. In the last years of King William's
reign, it is well known how much the spirits
of the tories were raised by the prospect of
a female reign, and how zealously the tory
writers exerted themselves to depreciate the
services of William, and to prepare the mind
of the people for what they now considered
not an improbable event, the restoration of
the male line of Stuart. One Tutchin,
whose name has already been noticed, pub-
lished at this crisis a violent attack upon King
William's person and government, entitled
The Foreigners. In this production, which
accused His Majesty of every kind of wicked-
ness, cruelty, and tyranny, the whole stream
of abuse was terminated with the one hateful
word Foreigner, and it was this last reproach
which chiefly roused the indignation of
Daniel Defoe." Of The true-born English-
man, the satire by which he replied to
* The foreign air of Daniel's own name, by the way,
was often made a matter of reproach among his contem-
poraries. It is now sufficiently certain, that the prefix de
which gives this French aspect to the patronimic, was
merely an invention of Daniel's own juvenile vanity
euphoniae causá.
Tutchin, it is not possible to speak very
highly, considering it merely as a piece of
poetical writing; but there is no question
that as a piece of historical argument, it is
quite irresistible, and not a few detached
passages display vigour of language and
fancy not unworthy of the author. It opens
with two lines which have since passed into
a proverb,
“Wherever God erects a house of prayer,
The Devil always builds a chapel there:”
and he adds,
“And 'twill be found, upon examination,
The latter has the largest congregation.”
The empire of Satan, we are then told, is
administered by different hands, in different
regions;—
“Pride, the first peer and president of Hell,
To his share Spain, the largest province fell.”
Germany is governed by Drunkenness, Italy
by Lust, Ireland by Zeal, Russia by Ignorance,
and, strange information,
“The Chinese by a child of Hell called WIT.”
To conclude the list,
“Rage rules the Portuguese, and Fraud the Scotch,
Revenge the Pole, and Avarice the Dutch.”
while INGRATITUDE has from time imme-
morial been the bane of England;
“A devil of black renown,
An ugly, surly, sullen, selfish spirit,
Who Satan's worst perfections does inherit.”
The confusion of races from which the
modern English are descended, is the chief
topic on which he enlarges.
“ The Romans first with Julius Caesar came,
Including all the nations of that name,
Gauls, Greeks, and Lombards; and by computation,
Auxiliaries or slaves of every nation.
With Hengist Saxons; Danes with Sweno came,
In search of plunder — not in search of fame;
Scots, Picts, and Irish from the Hibernian shore,
And conquering William brought the Normans o'er.
All these their barbarous offspring left behind,
The dross of armies—they of all mankind,
Blended with Britons, who before were here,
Of whom the Welch have blest the character.
From this amphibious ill-born mob began
That vain ill-natured thing, an Englishman;
The customs, surnames, languages, and manners
Of all these nations, are their own explainers;
Whose relics are so lasting and so strong,
They ha’ left a shibboleth upon our tongue,
By which with easy search you may distinguish,
Your Roman—Saxon—Danish—Norman—English.”
The copious additions of Huguenots, Wal-
loons, &c. in the reign of Queen Bess, the
strong tide of Scottish blood that entered
with James, and last of all, the effects or
the restoration of Charles the second, in this
way are described at length.
“He carefully repeopled us again,
Throughout his lazy, long, lascivious reign,
With such a blest and true-born English fry,
As much illustrates our nobility;
A gratitude which will so black appear,
As future ages must abhor to hear;
When they look back on all that crimson flood,
Which streamed in Lindeseys and Caernarvon's blood.
Bold Stafford, Cambridge, Capel, Lucas, Lisle,
Who crown'd in death his father's funeral pile;
The loss of whom, in order to supply
With true-born English-bred nobility.
Six bastard dukes survive his luscious reign,
The labours of Italian Castlemain, - }
French Portsmouth, Tabby Scot, and Cambrian,
Besides the numerous, bright, and virgin throng,
Whose female glories shade them from my song.
This offspring, if one age they multiply,
May half the house with English peers supply;
There with true English pride they may contemn,
Schomberg and Portland — new-made noblemen.”
To the second edition of this satire is
prefixed a preface, in which Defoe vindicates
himself from the charge of “depreciating his
countrymen.” “Had we been an unmixed
nation,” says he, sarcastically, “I am of opi-
nion it had been for our disadvantage. For, to
go no further, we have three nations about us,
as clear from mixtures of blood as any in the
world, and I know not which of them I could
wish ourselves to be like; I mean the Scots,
the Irish, and the Welsh : and if I were to
write a reverse to the satire, I would examine
all the nations of Europe, and prove that
those nations which are most mixed, are the
best, and have least of barbarism and bru-
tality about them; and abundance of reason
might be given for it, too long for a preface.”
Excellent as this performance may in some
respects deserve to be considered, it is not so
much for itself as for the effects it produced
on the condition of its author, that we have
noticed it at so much length. King William
was no great lover or judge of poetry; but
he had discernment enough to perceive that
Defoe was a valuable ally, and he immediately
expressed a wish to be personally acquainted
with him. That Daniel was forthwith sent
for to the palace, and conversed with the
King—that repeated interviews afterwards
followed this introduction—that His Majesty
was pleased with his manners and sentiments,
and ever after regarded him with favour—and
that he even employed him in many secret
services, all in consequence of the acceptable
VOL. I. b
flattery of the True-born Englishman—these
are facts, which Defoe himself mentioned at a
time when he could not have dared to invent
them; but the particular details, which he
neglected to consign to writing, cannot now be
supplied by all the researches that have been
made among the works of his cotemporaries
—friends and enemies to the government of
King William. The favour of the monarch,
Defoe in the meantime continued to culti-
vate by a variety of political tracts, the
names of which may be found in the list of
his woks, published at the end of this oreface.
The nature of the topics handled in them,
has condemned the greater part of them to
neglect and oblivion; but he that would write
or even study with accuracy the history of
that period of fermentation, alarm, and sus-
picion in the public mind of England, cannot
hope for success in his researches, unless he
has patience to go over the fugitive pieces of
Daniel Defoe. In many of them he will find
more amusement than their subjects might
lead him to expect—in all of them he will at
least find traces of a genuine and masculine
English intellect, and a power of language
which he will seek for in vain among the
far greater mass of miscellaneous politics,
either of that or of any other period in our
history. It is one of the chief reproaches of
our press, that no uniform or collected edition
of these works has ever appeared in England;
but of this, more hereafter.
The death of King William was thus a
personal misfortune of no small consequence
to Defoe; and ever after, the memory of that
prince was regarded and spoken of by him
with a sacred and grateful reverence, which
does honour to his feelings. During the vio-
lent tumults of party warfare, which immedi-
ately followed the death of his patron, and
the succession of Queen Anne, we find our
author exerting himself in prose and in verse,
in defence of the same religion and political
principles he had all along professed. The
ascendance gained by the high-church party,
gave extreme pain to him as a dissenter; and
he produced, for the purpose of annoying
them, and serving his own friends, a very
powerful piece of irony, which, strange to tell,
no one, either among those he wrote for, or
among those he wrote against, had wit enough
to comprehend; and yet one cannot peruse
The short way with the Dissenters, at this dis-
tance of time, without being astonished with
the extent of this stupidity. Every argument
b 2
of intolerance and bigotry is therein set forth
with most laborious assumption of gravity,
and such an invincible air of earnestness
however, that the zealots of both sides were
alike taken in. “The High-flyers”—as he calls
them — did not dare to espouse openly the
cause of one whom they considered in the
light of a too bold and incautious adherent—
while the deceived dissenters and their friends
in parliament, were loud in their cries for
revenge against the best writer their cause
could then boast,
“ — Such is the fate of too much wit,
Mistook and cursed by those that most are served
by it.”
If the chief Tory leaders understood his drift
at all, the former writings of Defoe had already
incensed them against him, and they were too
glad to seize an opportunity so favourable for
crushing an enemy, with the consent of his own
party. Accordingly we find, that on the 25th
of February 1702-3 a member rose in the
House of Commons, to move for the infliction
of some punishment upon the author of The
short way with the Dissenters; and having read
aloud some pages of it, the House immediately
resolved mem.com. “that this book being full of
false and scandalous reflections on this Par-
liament, and tending to promote sedition, be
burnt by the common hangman to-morrow
in New Palace Yard.”—This had been pre-
ceded by a royal proclamation of January
10th, to the following purpose: “Whereas .
Daniel Defoe alias Defooe is charged with
writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet,
entitled The shortest way with the Dissenters;
he is a middle-sized spare man, about 40 years
old, of a brown complexion, and dark brown
coloured hair, but wears a wig, a hooked nose,
a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole
near his mouth : was born in London, and
for many years was a hose factor in Free-
man's Yard in Cornhill, and now is owner of
the brick and pantile works near Tilbury Fort
in Essex: whoever shall discover the said
Daniel to one of Her Majesty's principal se-
cretaries of state, or any of Her Majesty's
justices of the peace, so he may be appre-
hended, shall have a reward of sé50, which
Her Majesty has ordered to be paid imme-
diately upon such discovery.” Did we not
know that many worthy divines preached and
prayed with all solemnity against Swift's
Project for discarding Christianity, conceiving
the argument of that famous jeu d'esprit to be
a serious strain of wicked blasphemy; and were
b 3
we not furnished in the subsequent history of
Defoe himself with another example of the
same kind of stupidity, we might be tempted
to set this down as a solitary and almost in-
credible instance of blindness and want of
perception. So it was however: pursued by a
royal proclamation, and denounced by a re-
solution of the Commons, Defoe soon found
himself unable to remain concealed. Whether
his retirement was betrayed by some false
friend, or whether his surrender was voluntary,
we find him shortly after submitting or com-
pelled to be tried for his crime of wit; and in
spite of an explanation he published on the
eve of his trial, than which nothing could
be more entirely full and satisfactory, he was
condemned to pay a fine which nearly ruined
his fortune *, to stand three times in the pil-
lory, and to be imprisoned during the Queen's
pleasure. He bore the pillory with infinite
fortitude, to which circumstance one of the
many ungenerous lines of the Dunciadalludes:
“Earless on high stood unabashed Defoe.”
* He says he lost by this affair £3,500, but he pro-
bably includes the damage done to his tile-work concerns
by his imprisonment; the fine itself was only 200 marks.
See State Trials, vol. v. ed. 1730, p. 553.
It is melancholy to see that such a man as
Pope was capable of enjoying the punish-
ment of a man like Defoe; punished only
because nobody had sense to understand his
meaning. Since we are speaking of the Dun-
ciad, we may as well notice the two other
introductions of Defoe's name in that poem:
“She saw old Pryn in restless Daniel shine,
And Eusden eke out Blackmore's endless line.”
In this, the ungenerous allusion to poor
Defoe's pillory is repeated. Pryn, as our
readers recollect, suffered the same punish-
ment in the age before, by reason of the
relentless animosity of Laud; and Defoe
doubtless shared much of the principles of
the old Puritan, as well as of his fate. The
third passage is that in which Pope avenges
himself on Norton, an obscure writer in the
Morning Post, for certain attacks in that
paper.
“Norton from Daniel and Ostraea sprung,
Blest with the father's front and mother's tongue.”
This piece of scandal is first found in Savage's
preface to his Author to be let ; where he says,
“Had it not been an honester livelihood for
Mr. Norton, (Daniel Defoe's son of love by a
lady who vended oysters,) to have dealt in a
b 4
fish market, than to be dealing out the
dialect of Billingsgate in the Flying Post.”
Some of the other members of the Scriblerus
Club, seem to have shared in Pope's absurdly
low opinion of Defoe. Hear what Gay says
of him,-‘‘The fellow, who had excellent na-
tural talents, but wanted some small founda-
tion of learning, is a lively instance of those
wits, who, as an ingenious author says, will
bear but one skimming".” That Pope might
be entitled in many points of view to look
down on Defoe, it may be granted: but the
contempt of Gay for such a man as the author
of Robinson Crusoe, is really too much of a
joke to pass unnoticed; one skimming ! It is
thus, that a man of mere elegance and wit,
but by no means entitled to be classed with
the creative or majestic spirits of the earth,
dares to speak of the rich, the inexhaustible
genius, which produced works that will out-
live the language in which they are written,
should that language ever be forgotten: It is
thus, that in every age your people of accom-
plishment and acuteness have dared to lift up
their voices in derision of the true “Men of
Might !” But let the small men of our own
time profit by the example of those of days
* State of Wit, 1711.
preceding; let them observe, that the author
of Gay's Fables satirized the author of Robin-
son Crusoe in his own days, to the satisfaction
of the coffee-house wits; and discover in the
smile with which we now regard such satire,
the sure index to the judgment of posterity
on their sarcasms against greater men than
Defoe, “homines longè minores longé majora
commissi.”
Defoe, in the meantime, was cast down
neither by the severity of his punishment
nor the sarcasms of his enemies. He pub-
lished almost immediately a Hymn to the
Pillory, in which the spirit of the man gives
new spirit to his poetry. He says,
66 Men, that are men, in thee can feel no pain,
And all thy insignificants disdain.
Contempt, that false new word for Shame,
Is, without crime, an empty name;
A shadow to amuse mankind,
But cannot fright the wise or well-fix'd mind.
Virtue despises human scorn,
And scandals innocence adorn.”
The great John Selden was at one time in
danger of the pillory, on account of his
History of Tythes; and, in allusion to this,
he goes on,
“Even the learned Selden saw,
A prospect of thee through the law;
He had thy lofty pinnacles in view,
But so much honour never was thy due.
Had the great Selden triumphed on thy stage,
Selden, the honour of his age,
No man would ever shun thee more,
Or grudge to stand where Selden stood before.” "
An Elegy on the Author of the true-born
Englishman followed shortly after — full of a
similar strain of sentiments, but very inferior
in its style of composition. The most ani-
mated part of it is a severe attack on the
lawyers, for he seems to have thought his
defence had been but poorly conducted :

It is impossible not to acquiesce in the justice
of Defoe's displeasure against those who had
undertaken his defence on the late trial.
Nothing but the utmost weakness or wicked-
ness on the part of bar, bench, and jury,
can account for the issue of it.
During the first months of his confinement
he republished a variety of his pieces, under
the name of “A true Collection of the Works
of the Author of the True-born Englishman,”
in one volume 8vo, to which another volume
was shortly added. To the first volume a
head of Defoe was prefixed, engraved by
Vandergucht from a picture by Taverner.
It is the same from which all the other prints
of Defoe have been copied ; and no portrait
*
can have more verisimilitude, to say the
least of it. It exhibits a set of features
rather regular than otherwise, very deter-
mined in their outlines, more particularly the
mouth, which expresses great firmness and
resolution of character. The eyes are full,
black, and grave-looking; but the impression
of the whole countenance is rather a striking
than a pleasing one. Daniel is here set forth
in a most lordly full-bottomed wig, which
flows down lower than his elbow, and rises
above his forehead with great amplitude of
curl. A richly laced cravat, and fine loose
flowing cloak, complete his attire, and pre-
serve, we may suppose, the likeness of that
civic “gallantry,” which Oldmixon ascribes
to Daniel on the occasion of his escorting
King William to the Lord Mayor's feast. It
is altogether more like the picture of a sub-
stantial citizen of the “surly breed” Defoe
himself has so often satirized, than that of
a poor pamphleteer languishing in jail after
the terrors of the pillory.
The distressed state of his circumstances,
it is probable, made our prisoner soon feel it
necessary to undertake some regular work,
by which he might support himself during his
confinement: and the plan which he accord-
ingly laid down for himself, and the manner
in which he carried it on for a great number
of years, are alike honourable to his judg-
ment and his perseverance. The first number
of THE REview was published on the 19th
of February 1703-4, and continued to appear
at first twice, afterwards three times a week,
for full nine years afterwards. In this paper,
which appeared in the shape of a quarto
sheet, Defoe gave a summary of all news,
foreign and domestic, together with his own
opinions at great length on all matters of
political or commercial interest. To enliven
the pages of his journal, he devoted a part of
every sheet to the annals of a fictitious
Scandal Club, of whose concerns he gave
himself out to be the sole secretary and depo-
sitary, and in this way took occasion to divert
the town with the description of a thousand
lighter topics of all kinds. Criticism, theo-
logy, ethics, in all their branches, but more
particularly the tea-table and coffee-house
topics of “language, poetry, love, marriage,
drunkenness, and gaming,” are continually
introduced.
There can be no doubt of the fact,
although Dr. Johnson was either ignorant
or disdainful of it, that this part of Defoe's
design paved the way for, and set the ex-
ample of, that species of writing soon after-
wards carried to its perfection in the Tatlers
and Spectators. ' That Daniel Defoe wanted
many of those qualities, both of mind and
manner, which fitted Steele and Addison to
be the inimitable arbitri elegantiarum of
English society, there can be no doubt :
yet it is in vain to conceal that they profited
very much by the inventive genius which pre-
ceded them in their favourite path; or to deny
that there exist in the Reviews of Defoe many,
very many passages, which for wit, humour,
originality of conception, justness of observa-
tion, keenness of satire, and for power, variety,
nay, even elegance of style, are scarcely in-
ferior to the best specimens of their compo-
sitions. The political articles of the Review,
however, were doubtless as much superior to
the others in interest then, as they are in-
ferior now. It was evident abundantly, from
the impression they made on the public
mind, that the various rich and energetic
talents of Defoe, might under proper direc-
tions render him a most important ally to
any party. The sagacity of Sir Robert
Harley, then speaker of the commons, led
him very early to make this discovery, and
he lost no time in communicating his senti-
ments to Defoe himself. Hear Daniel’s own
account of Harley's first communication
with him: “While I lay friendless and dis-
tressed, “says he, “in the prison of Newgate,
my family ruined, and myself without hope
of deliverance, a message was brought me
from a person of honour, who till that time
I never had the least acquaintance with or
knowledge of, otherwise than by fame or
sight, as we know men of quality by seeing
them on public occasions. I gave no present
answer to the person who brought it, having
not duly weighed the import of the message.
The message was by word of mouth, thus,
‘Pray ask that gentleman what I can do
for him P” But in return to this kind and
generous message, I immediately took my
pen and ink, and wrote the story of the Blind
Man in the gospel who followed our Saviour,
and to whom our blessed Lord put the
question, ‘What wilt thou that I shall do
unto thee P’ who, as if he had made it
strange that such a question should be
asked, or as if he had said, Lord, dost thou
see that I am blind, and yet ask me what
thou shalt do for me? My answer is plain
in my misery; Lord, that I may receive my
sight. I needed not to make the applica-
tion. And from this time, although I lay four
months in prison after this, and heard no
more of it, yet from this time, as I learned
afterwards, this noble person made it his
business to have my case represented to her
Majesty, and methods taken for my deliver-
ance.” Queen Anne, as he elsewhere tells
us, expressed great concern when she under-
stood the truth of Defoe's case; she said
expressly, “that she left all that matter to
a certain person, and did not think he would
use him thus,” and sent through the trea-
surer Godolphin “a considerable supply.”
for his wife and family. Harley, becoming
almost immediately afterwards secretary of
state, Defoe was discharged from confine-
ment, and received from the Queen money
enough to pay his fine and the expences of
the discharge.
On being set free he retired with his
family to St. Edmond's Bury which he has
in his travels called “ the Montpelier of
England,” to recruit his strength after his
long confinement, by the genial air and
exercise of the country. His Review, how-
ever, continued to be published regularly;
and various separate works which appeared
about this time attest his unwearied zeal
and industry. “ The Consolidator, or
Memoirs of sundry Transactions from the
World of the Moon,” is the chief of these,
a prose satire by no means in his best style,
but which possessed power enough to excite
the rage of the Swedish Ambassador, on
account of some sarcastic reflections it con-
tained against the mad policy of Charles XII.
The formal complaint lodged against him by
his excellency did not however produce any
effect with the government." But “ the
High Church Legion,” an attack on Dr. Drake,
a champion of the tories, had gone near to
prove more injurious to him. Towards the
end of the year he made a journey to Exeter
on matters of business, and some of his
enemies hearing of this, made an attempt,
which we can scarcely read of without
wonder at the present time, to have him
impressed for a soldier. Compulsory enlist-
ments for the land service were then as usual as
they have ever been for the sea service; but
the audacity that could make any one think
of subjecting to such treatment a freeholder
* The Consolidator is one of the last of Defoe's writings
a reader of the present day could find pleasure in ; but it
deserves notice, if on no other account, for this reason,
that it certainly contains the first hints of many of the ideas
which Swift many years afterwards embodied in Gulliver,
particularly in his account of Laputa, the book-making
machine, &c. &c. It contains moreover a great many
bye-hits against all the authors of the time, from Dryden
to Tom Durfey.
VOL. I. C
of England, and a liveryman of London, (to
say nothing of Defoe's higher and still more
personal qualities)—cannot fail to excite our
utmost surprise and disgust. As a trait of
the manners of the times, the incident is
abundantly deserving of notice. But Defoe's
address and resolution were not so easily
to be overcome. He was brought before a
magistrate as a vagabond, but struck such
awe into him by his mode of answering, that
he was instantly set free. All the circum-
stances of this remarkable transaction were
immediately detailed in the Review, but for
which authority it would scarcely have
been possible for us to believe such things
had really occurred so lately within this
island.
“Giving alms no charity,” is another
separate publication of the same year, called
forth by a bill for employing the poor,
brought into parliament by Sir Humphrey
Mackworth. It is singular with what acute-
ness Defoe describes and exposes in this
tract very many of those evils of the
poor rate system, which have in our day
come to such a height, as to form the sub-
ject of most serious concern to all that
consider the state of these realms. The
absurdity of interfering by legislative enact-
ments with the direction of the industry
of individuals is demonstrated with all
the power of our author's mind and lan-
guage; but some other things which he de-
monstrates with apparently scarce inferior
distinctness lead to strange comparisons be-
tween the state of England in those days, and
in ours; as, for example, in his own words,
“That there is in England more labour than
hands to perform it, and consequently a want
of people, not of employment;”— and that
“No man in England can be poor, merely
for want of employment.” These expressions
recall in a very striking manner the immense
increase in our population during the last
century; and the still more extraordinary
change that has occurred in the character of
our population. At the end of the same year,
he had a paper war with Lord Haversham, a
great speech-maker of those days; whose
speech in parliament, on the state of the nation,
had strongly excited his wrath. Here, as in
all his political writings, one of Defoe's most
powerful weapons is personal satire. At the
close of one of his pamphlets or broadsides (as
Swift called them), he says happily, in allusion
to the different fortunes of his opponent and
himself, “Fate, that makes footballs of men,
kicks some up, some down; some are advanced
c 2
without honour, some suppressed without
infamy; some are raised without merit, some
are crushed without a crime; and no man
knows from the beginning of things, whether
his course shall issue in a PEERAGE or a
PILLoRY " —The beginning of the next year
(1706) produced Defoe's longest and worst
poetical production, “Jure Divino, a satire
in twelve books.” The justice of his arguments
cannot in general be disputed, though a
strange mixture of religious bigotry deforms
throughout his right notions on the subject of
civil liberty; but nothing can be more dull
and unreadable than this bulky octavo.
Dryden’s Hind and Panther suggested the
work; but Defoe did ill when he presumed to
tread in the footsteps of Dryden. His per-
formance has no pretensions to the only
qualities that made Dryden's political poetry
succeed—its purpose was good, and it displays
sometimes vigour of language, as well as of
thought; but it wants all the graces of
“The varying verse, the full resounding line,
The long majestic march, and energy divine.”
The best two lines in the whole, are perhaps
these, although they are not the smoothest:
&g
He is a fool, and must be ruled by slaves,
That may be king of freemen, and would be king
of slaves.” -
By these various productions, the character
of Defoe as a writer, (if not as a poet,) was
raised and established; and his importance
was fairly acknowledged by his enemies; and
what he probably considered as scarcely less
singular, by his friends. The treasurer Godol-
phin had embraced Harley's high opinion of
him, and continued to hold it, even after he
quarrelled with that first patron of Defoe. By
this minister he was at least twice introduced
into the presence of Queen Anne herself, with
whom his manners seem to have ingra-
tiated him, as they had before with King
William. He was employed by her majesty,
or her government, in what he calls “several
honourable though secret services,” the exact
nature of which we cannot now ascertain,
though from what we know of his after-history,
we may believe the description he gives of
them to be not at all exaggerated. During this
period, he avoided having any intercourse
with Harley entirely, with a view to prevent
Godolphin from entertaining any suspicions of
his secrecy; nor did Harley misunderstand or
resent in any manner this conduct, which at
first sight might look like ingratitude. To-
wards the conclusion of the year, the ability
he had shewn in these minor matters, recom-
mended him as a fit person to be sent down
c 3
to Scotland, to lend assistance in the great
affair of the union. His history of the intrigues
which preceded the completion of this long
desired conjunction of the two crowns, which
he published soon after his return from
Scotland, must always be read with the most
lively interest; it is minute to excess; but
that is no fault; and the keen, energetic, and
penetrating mind it displays, leaves in us no
wonder at the choice of Godolphin and his
mistress. It appears from the opening of this
history, that long before he had conversed
with King William on the subject of the
union; but indeed it is sufficiently obvious,
that the subject must have engaged for many
years a chief share of the attention of all who
had any part in the administration of the
British government, or took any lead in the
criticism of its measures. The History of the
Union was reprinted handsomely, in quarto,
in the year 1786, with a preface on the pro-
priety of an union with Ireland, by Delolme,
and the life of Defoe by George Chalmers.
During this visit to Scotland, his active
mind appears to have been busily engaged in
gathering stores of information concerning
the history and condition of that country;
both of which subjects had, up to that period,
attracted, comparatively speaking, no consider-
able portion of attention from the people of
the sister kingdom. Defoe, in his quality of a
sincere and zealous dissenter from the Church
of England, was attracted, not repelled by
most of those circumstances of national faith
and manners, which were disagreeable to the
English writers, who had hitherto treated of
the affairs of Scotland; and so, without doing
any violence to his own feelings, he laboured
effectually by his representations to remove
the barriers of antipathy between the nations.
He seems to have made diligent journeys over
most parts of the northern kingdom, and has
left a picture of her then state, which cannot
be perused without the highest interest, by
those who are acquainted with the face of
Scotland now.” Her institutions, civil and
religious, he has described with all the fulness
of partiality—her cities and palaces graphi-
cally and distinctly. For the romantic beauties
of the Scottish soil, which have chiefly found
favour in the eyes of subsequent travellers,
Defoe however appears to have had small
relish; and the readers of the present tasteful
age will smile at the cockney prejudices which
break out in his remarks, on many pieces of

till 1723.

scenery which have since been immortalized
in song and tale, and are trod every year by
the feet of so many hundreds of enthusiastic
tourists from the country of Daniel Defoe.
Inter alia (for one example is as good as a
thousand), he expresses much astonishment
at the choice of situation for the castle of
Drumlanrig in Dumfries-shire: but who would
guess the circumstances that displeased the
fastidious critic P “It is placed upon a rock
and among mountains, in a very coarse country.”
Such were the eyes with which Defoe gazed on
the beautiful valley of the Nith, and its ma-
jestic cincture of heath-clad hills. Another
of his works, the materials of which were
gathered at this period, although it also was
published some years afterwards, is the His-
tory of the Church of Scotland, a very
valuable book, evincing research of no com-
mon order, and written in a style of felicity
even beyond what is common in its author.
His narrative of the earlier part of the event-
ful history of the Presbyterian Church may
be perused with pleasure even by those who
have lived to see the same period treated of
by the greatest historical writer of the present
day, Dr. M'Crie ; while his representations
of the more recent troubles in the time of
the Covenanters, his descriptions of the
battles of Claverhouse, and the cruelties of
the persecution under James II., need scarcely
shrink from a comparison with some of the
most picturesque passages in the first Tales
of my Landlord. When we consider the
character and tendency of these works, we
cannot help being surprised to find that
neither of them have ever been republished
in Scotland. Without doubt they might have
formed an acceptable addition to the elegant
edition of Defoe's novels, which issued some
years ago from the press of the Ballantynes.
As for CALEDoNIA, an encomiastic effusion
in verse, which Defoe published during his
residence in the Scottish capital, if its flattery
pleased those for whom it was written, it
must be admitted that this was all it deserved.
The utmost zeal of national partiality could
not now revive its forgotten dulness.
His services in Scotland to those who sent
him thither were important. He attended the
committees of parliament in Edinburgh, and
made calculations on subjects of trade and
taxation for the ministers. He incurred
many personal dangers by the fidelity with
which he performed what was entrusted to
him. He was mobbed in the streets, and had
his windows broken, and on one occasion
escaped with difficulty by the care of his
friends. Of these occurrences, however, we
have no account, except a few hints in his
own History of the Union. He returned to
London as soon as the great affair was
settled; and had a pension of some kind, but
of what value we know not, assigned to him
by Lord Godolphin. That the discharge of
some duties of a fixed nature was the con-
dition of this allowance from the Queen's
purse, we know ; but are equally ignorant
what those duties were. Whatever they were,
he continued to discharge them, and to re-
ceive their reward, by the advice of Godol-
phin himself, after that minister's expulsion
from office in the next year; and from this
we may infer they were of some very subor-
dinate character. The History of the Union,
and the History of Addresses (a work com-
piled in order to abate the fervour against
Sacheverel), attest that those duties did not
engross his time. During the whole of his
residence in Scotland he furnished the ma-
terials for the Review ; and he continued it
during this period also with unabated dili-
gence. There is reason to suppose that his
worldly circumstances were now pretty com-
fortable, for he describes himself as writing his
Reviews in a “nice retirement” at Newington,
a pleasant situation, endeared to him as we
have seen by the recollections of his boyish
years. There were not wanting enemies, who, in
order to destroy the effect of Defoe's writings,
afterwards asserted that during this period his
pen had been employed in the composition of
tory tracts and pamphlets, the implied con-
dition, as they would have us to understand,
of the continuance of his allowance. But we
shall soon have to notice a most speaking in-
stance of the falseness of these charges. When
Harley himself, bred in revolution principles,
first came into power, he did so indeed by
the aid of the tory party; but he had neither
espoused their principles in their full extent,
nor did he consent to any thing like a total
expulsion of the whigs from office; for this
last part of his policy, indeed, as our readers
may remember, he was some years afterwards
severely blamed by Swift in the celebrated
“FreeThoughts on the State of publicAffairs.”
But the minister's object, no doubt, was to
strengthen his own power, by carrying along
with him as many of the more moderate whigs
as he could detach from Godolphin's party;
and if he failed ultimately in the attainment
of this object, the blame was more imputable
to the fiery and audacious temper of his col-
league Bolingbroke, than to himself. As yet,
however, Bolingbroke himself had not entirely
forgotten the whig principles, in which he
also had been educated ; or if such a change
had taken place in his mind, it was not sus-
pected even by those who knew him best.
Defoe in truth, less than any one, either of the
political rulers of that period, or even than any
of its political writers, seems to have merited
the blame of versatility in political principle;
he wrote against the peace of Utrecht, al-
though by doing so, he must have known he
was thwarting Harley in the dearest and most
important of all his measures; yet his honesty
does not appear even in this delicate instance
to have lost him the protection of the minister.
He wrote shortly after three pamphlets against
the Pretender*, the irony of which being again
totally misunderstood by the whigs, called
down upon him the full vengeance of that
party in parliament. It is not to be imagined
that Harley or Bolingbroke could misunder-

stand the purpose of these tracts; and it is
a circumstance very honourable to them, that
while the whig leaders, whose cause Defoe
was serving, did all they could to crush him,
they, whose friends were really attacked by
him, exerted themselves in his behalf. A pro-
secution was commenced against him; and
some expressions he made use of in defending
himself in his Review, having displeased the
Court of King's Bench, he was committed to
Newgate. But Harley procured him the
Queen's pardon; and Bolingbroke it appears
joined in the application to her Majesty. The
whigs abused the ministers for this protection
of Defoe, “an open jacobite:” but Defoe
said in his own way and with justice, “they
might as well have called me a Mahometan.”
Disgusted with the stupidity of the party
whom he had so long served, and who had now
done all they could to injure him—disgusted,
it is easy to believe with the profession of a
regular political writer, which had now twice
brought him to the verge of ruin — Defoe
dropt his Review during this his second con-
finement in Newgate, as nine years before he
bad commenced it, to occupy his own mind
and to support his family, in the solitude of
the same prison. A few separate political
tracts were published by him after his dis-
charge ; but he was already more than half
sick of the trade. In the beginning of 1715,
he wrote his “ Appeal to Honour and Justice;”
a plain, manly, and convincing defence of
his own political life; and being struck with
an apoplexy immediately on finishing it,
it was published by his friends during the
period of his slow and uncertain recovery
from the effects of this calamitous visita-
tion. His pension, whatever it was, died
with the administration of Bolingbroke, and
the accession of the Elector of Hanover.
For writing in behalf of the Hanoverian
succession he had already undergone the
pains of persecution and imprisonment, and
now he was a loser not a gainer by the
triumph of that cause for which he had done
and suffered so much. But why should we
waste words in complaining of things that
afterwards contributed so largely to the
fortune and fame of Defoe himself, and were
productive of so great service to the litera-
ture of his country The close of his poli-
tical life was in truth the beginning of
Defoe's greatness; in the retirement which he
now quitted no more, the leisure of his active
spirit was occupied in the creation of a
series of works which raised his name im-
measureably higher than it had ever been
before in the opinion of his cotemporaries,
and which will preserve that name in fresh-
ness and honour so long as the language in
which they are written endures; so long as
penetration, wit, genius, and eloquence
preserve their place in the estimation of
mankind. The rapidity with which these,
the best and greatest of Defoe's works,
followed each other into the world, after
he had got fairly into the vein of composing
them, is a sufficient proof not only of the ex-
traordinary fertility of his mind, but that he
now possessed undisturbed quiet, wherein to
call out and employ with uniform zeal and
success all its manifold resources. From the
point of time at which Robinson Crusoe was
published, down to the death of Defoe, which
occurred in the year 1731, almost the only
incidents that mark the progress of the
author's history, are the successive appear-
ances of the new works produced in his retire-
ment. From a single circumstance or two
indeed it appears, that though he almost en-
tirely dropt politics, he had still retained some
little occasional hankerings after the more
active pursuits of commerce. Among other
speculations, he had at one time a lease of a
farm, but we find him soon after disposing of it.
Defoe, the truth of the matter is, was now
perhaps too much of an author to be able to
succeed in any thing but authorship : book-
making was his trade, and he considered it
as such, carrying into it all the strength of
his mind in all its varieties of operation;
exerting to the utmost his power as a crea-
tive genius, under the direction of a most
acute and sagacious judgment, which very
seldom misled him into any unfertile or
unfortunate path of exertion. It is on the
whole rarely that we meet in the whole
course of the history of literature, with any
thing at all resembling this last part of the
career of Defoe. Men who possess that
force and fire of fancy requisite for the
striking out of new ways and species for
themselves, are most commonly persons of so
much delicacy of temperament, that they
can comparatively seldom bring themselves
to the labour of exerting their faculties to
the full. After producing one work, or a few
works, by which they conceive themselves to
have sufficiently exhibited their power and
secured their fame, they slumber over the
embers which they will not arouse them-
selves to blow, and allow the fire they might
have kept bright and blazing to be smothered
under the ashes of indolence. Our own
literary history indeed, more than that of any
othermodern nation, furnishes splendid excep-
tions to this rule, both in past times and in the
present; and of these Defoe must ever
continue to be esteemed one of the most
illustrious.
The state of his worldly circumstances
must, without doubt, be reckoned among the
chief incentives of his extraordinary dili-
gence. In all the works of Defoe we find
the impress of a mind accustomed to find
delight in the occupation of the world, to
participate with a lively interest in the ordi-
nary business, and pleasures, and recreations
of mankind. Had he been possessed of an
independent fortune, it is very probable he
might have spent his time with pleasure to
himself, as he certainly would with all ad-
vantage to those about him, in these the
common functions and amusements of life,
without devoting any thing like so great a
portion of his days and nights to the labours
of solitary meditation and composition. But
in the toil to which he was at first stimulated
by his necessities, who can doubt that he
soon came to find his most unfailing source
of pleasure—an inexhaustible source, which
might well atone to him for the loss of others,
less rich and less peculiar. The pleasure
and the excitement with which we still pe-
VOI,. I. d:
ruse his works, is only the dim shadow and
reflection of the more intense pleasure he
must have tasted in conceiving and creating
them. Book-making, in the hands of a dull
man, is the worst and the most degrading of all
drudgeries; in the hands of a Daniel Defoe
it changes its character, and becomes the
noblest and the most delightful of all possi-
ble occupations. Having acquired by long
practice the most perfect ease in the use of
his instruments, and having the possession
of an intellectual mine no less deep than
broad, the work of production was to him
scarcely a work — repaid as it already was,
(to say nothing of its after-rewards), by the
perpetual delights of conscious acquisition
and extended power. We sometimes hear
people expressing wonder that a great author
should “ take the trouble to write so
much;” and authors themselves of the me-
diocre class are the very people from whom
we most frequently hear this language.
With them composition is a task and a
toil, and they suppose that it is the same
with all men; as the heavy fowl that with
difficulty swings itself across the farm-yard,
may perhaps regard with wonder, if not with
pity, the perpetual unwearied soarings of
the “Bird of Jove.
The well-known story of Alexander Selkirk,
a poor Scotsman, who had lived for a long
course of years by himself on the island of
Juan Fernandez, being published in a pam-
phlet, and received with that interest the
extraordinary nature of its incidents de-
served, attracted the notice of Defoe soon
after he had desisted from his political
writings, and was the means of first directing
him to the species of composition on which
his chief fame was destined ultimately to rest.
The malice of some of his cotemporaries
suggested, that he had acquired possession,
by some accident, of Selkirk's own papers;
and that Robinson Crusoe was nothing but a
book-maker's extension of the deserted ma-
riner's own narrative. But for this there was
no ground. Robinson Crusoe is a most
skilful romance, of which the first idea indeed
was borrowed from the strange story of Alex-
ander Selkirk; , but in which the whole ar-
rangement and execution—all the filling up
of incident, reflection, and character—are
truly and entirely Defoe's : and the same sort
of criticism that would diminish the credit of
its author, would produce the same effect on
the authors of all the celebrated epic and
almost all the celebrated dramatic poems in
the world. He took no more of Robinson
d 2
Crusoe from Selkirk's story, than Shakespeare
did of Macbeth and Hamlet from the old
Scotch and Danish Chronicles; or of Romeo
and Juliet from the Italian ballad.
The Adventures of Captain Singleton—
The Life of Colonel Jacque—The Memoirs
of a Cavalier—The new Voyage round the
World—The History of the Plague in Lon-
don — The Religious Courtship — Moll
Flanders — Roxana — and some inferior
pieces of the same class, were all produced
in the course of a few years after the appear-
ance of Robinson Crusoe; and though none
of them has ever attained quite the same
measure of popularity, yet most of them are
not unknown to our readers; and all of them,
as they are aware, abound in the same pecu-
liarities of invention, interest, and manner,
which excited the admiration of the world
when Defoe's first romance was published,
and, along with it, the envy of such as would
fain have been his rivals. The success at-
tending such a series of works, soon raised
Defoe far above the effects of their idle
malignity. He held in his hands larger
means of gratifying the larger part of the
reading public of the day, than perhaps any
one of his cotemporaries: and in the use of
these means he was as indefatigable as he was
happy in their possession. He became in a
word, in spite of all they said or did, a British
classic in the noblest sense of that term, in
the universal estimation of his countrymen;
and such he ever has continued, and ever
must continue to be. Of works so well-
known as his masterpieces, it would at this
time of day be absurd to enter either into
any detailed account, or any formal criticism.
The titles and dates we leave to be gathered
from the list we have added of all his known
performances, and shall now proceed to sum
up our sketch with a few general remarks on
the peculiar character of Defoe as a writer,
more particularly as it is displayed in the
Novel to which these pages are prefixed.
The first thing that must strike every one
who compares him with any other writer of
fictitious narrative, is the unequalled intense
reality which he throws around every part of
his fiction. With such exquisite powers of
fancy and of wit as he possessed, no one ever
possessed the same command over himself—
to use these powers, wherever it was fit they
should be used, without suffering the pleasure
of employing them to lead into unnecessary
ornament. He never describes anything
merely for the sake of the description: every-
thing is strictly subservient to the main matter
d 3
in hand : nothing is omitted that can serve
the true and main purpose of the story :
nothing added only for the sake of displaying
the powers of the writer. Above all, in those
of his novels where the chief personage is
made to tell his own story, it is wonderful
what superiority this part of his skill gives
Defoe, even over authors of much higher
powers, in one sense of the word, than him-
self. Others may invent incidents of a more
happy nature, but it is the charm of Defoe
that, let his incidents be as common-place as
may be, we read them at the full stretch of
interest; simply because, for the moment, the
irresistible belief is upon us that these things
really occurred exactly as they are set down
in the book before us. Nobody ever skips
over a page or two in one of his tales, be-
cause he is in a hurry to get on, and suspects
that the story will be just as intelligible with-
out what he is passing over as with it. We
are bound to the page by the grave character
of history, at the same time that we read it
with the delight of happiest fiction. Every
thought that passed through the mind of the
hero is set down, and we feel that there
would be a want of candour in refusing to
see what it was ; we are gained over to his
side, even if he be a villain, by the honesty
with which he lets us into the secrets of his
inmost heart. The nature that is so com-
municative cannot be entirely depraved; the
charm of frankness and confidence over-
comes and subdues us. The reader is made
the father confessor of him that addresses
him, and it would be a breach of duty to turn
a deaf ear to any thing he has to say.
It is no easy matter however to decide by
what particular art Defoe has continued to
make his stories so much more real in their
aspect than any other novelist; the chief
secret, perhaps, is nothing but his delight in
giving all the details of the action or course
of thought he is engaged with. Other writers
give us the main points, and please us by the
opportunity they afford us of filling up the
interstices, by the exercise of our own ima-
ginations for ourselves. Such is not the way
of Defoe; he must be allowed to tell you all,
or he will tell you nothing: He stops in the
midst of the darkest horrors of the plague to
give a long account of some old woman steal-
ing beaver hats out of a warehouse; a trifling
matter surely, and not worthy for itself of
being told among the mass of black thoughts
and doings to which the moral corruption of
the pestilence gave rise. But then how com-
pletely this trifling circumstance establishes in
d 4
our minds the conviction that we are listening
to the narrative of a true and authentic eye-
witness; not of one that had heard of the
horrors of the plague, and is employing his
imagination to body forth a picture of which
the outline only had been supplied by his
memory; but of one that had walked the
streets of London during the awful visitation,
with all his personal feelings and interests
alive in his mind; surveying the dreary cala-
mity-struck city, with the eyes of a man and
a christian—but still remembering his own
concerns, and watching like a careful brother
over the safety of his absent brother's store-
shop. When the author of Tom Jones, or
Roderic Random, or Gil Blas, introduces one
of his characters, and gives you a full descrip-
tion of his person and attire, it is evidently
for the purpose of amusing us: when the
author of Waverly and Ivanhoe does so, it is
from the delight he feels in communicating
the vivacity of his own imagination to us, and
bestowing the freshness of things seen on the
phantoms of days gone by. When Defoe
does the same thing, it is because the nature
of the person in whose mouth he puts the de-
scription, is such as to make that an essential
part of his communication; we should rather
say of her communication, for he commonly
takes care to put such details into the mouth
of a female. Roxana, the vain, beautiful, high-
dressed Roxana, never mentions a beau or
a belle, but she must tell us the colour of his
breeches, or the pattern of her petticoat.
The coarser mind of Moll Flanders was never
caught by such trifles as these; but she dwells
on the full muscular outline of her Lancashire
husband's leg, and fills a dozen pages with
an account of the fat dishes they had at their
wedding supper in the inn. Robinson Crusoe
enumerates every nail he put into his cabin;
but then, whatever Robinson Crusoe had was
the work of his own ingenuity, and who can
wonder at the pride of his detail. The only
novelist that ever rivalled Defoe in this point
of his art, was Richardson; but that is not
the only particular in which Richardson is the
imitator of Defoe.
. It is not, however, by his circumstantiality
and spirit of minute detail alone, that Defoe
gives this unequalled effect of truth and reality
to his fiction. These are the first things that
strike the reader's fancy; but on laying down
any one of his works, it is felt irresistibly, that
the essence of the charm lies in something far
deeper than these. All other novelists, com-
pared with him, are more or less painters of
the ideal of human life; we do not mean of
the beau ideal, for that many of them totally
despise as well as he ; but of its ideal of ex-
citement. He paints not only the minute
items of human life and action exactly as they
are, but its whole scope and tenour also is
viewed and represented by him, and by him
alone, exactly as it is. Others carry their
heroes and heroines through all varieties of
fortune, but they continue every thing in
order to make the interest progressive, and
the last scene is always intended to be the ex-
quisitely interesting catastrophe of a through-
out interesting tale. Defoe on the other hand
always shews himself to be perfectly aware,
that the prosaic part of existence is far greater
than the poetic; that mountains are ever suc-
ceeded and separated by valleys; that the
most romantic avenue often conducts into a
dull and level wideness of plain; and that the
most picturesque of rivers expands into the
tameness of utility, before it melts into the
all-equalizing sea. — Instead therefore of la-
bouring to heighten the interest of one scene
above that which has gone before, he is con-
tented to make both natural, and never fears
but, if they be so, both will be sufficiently in-
teresting. His lovers are not always married;
nor do his duellists always escape. The same
laws by which men and things are governed
in the world, govern them in his representa-
tions of the world; an unforeseen storm sinks
the fairest vessel into the sea, with all her
equipment; absence cools the most ardent
lovers; time consoles the most despairing
mourners; the sonneteer burns his sonnets,
and learns to laughat himself; and the widow’s
heart is made to sing aloud for joy. His
women are never angels, nor his misers sen-
timental. Moll Flanders becomes a quiet
good body in Virginia; and the fair Roxana
dies in the Rasp-house at Amsterdam.
We have already seen what bad con-
sequences this intensely natural mode of
writing sometimes produced on the fortunes
of Defoe himself—we have seen him pilloried
once, and imprisoned twice, because his irony
was too exquisite to be understood by judge
or jury; we have seen the whigs persecuting
him because he wrote a satire on the tories.
It is no wonder, therefore, that the critics of
his day should have thought Robinson Crusoe
was made up from the papers of Alexander
Selkirk—that the Memoirs of a Cavalier should
have been quoted a hundred times, as an
authentic history—or that a map should have
been published, in which the track of his
New Voyage round the World was laid down
with the same accuracy as that of Captain
Cooke.
The writings of Daniel Defoe are valuable
on many accounts; but for nothing so much
as for the insight they give us into the true
character and habits of the English people,
as exemplified in walks of life little understood
or far less happily represented by the other no-
velists and painters of manners our island has
produced. Without reading and studying the
Religious Courtship in particular, the Complete
English Tradesman, and the Family Instructor,
no man can hope to understand thoroughly
the character and manners of the middle
classes of his countrymen. There cannot be
a more perfectly national writer than Defoe—
every thought of his, every word, every image
is intensely English; there is not one page in
his works, that does not remind one the
author was born in London, and lived in the
days of King William and Queen Anne. The
homely way in which he looks at every thing
— the sagacious scorn with which he regards
all pretences of the fine and the romantic—
his thorough-going citizen-like substantial
perception of the prudent and the seemly—
his broad buffeting style of sarcasm *—his
deep sincere masculine pathos — every thing
about him, and his “ round unvarnished
tales,” reminds us that he was a hosier on
Holborn Hill, - and makes us honour the
name of an English tradesman for the sake of
old Daniel Defoe. When he walks forth into
the country (and few of his works are more
delightful than his Travels through England
and Scotland), he carries all the prejudices of
the city life along with him, and describes
whatever he sees exactly as he might have done
by word of mouth to his next door neighbour
after returning from an actual trip in the way of
business. London, and London alone, he de-
scribes with all the warmth andfulness of a lover.
It is easy to see, that in her was centered his
idea of all human grandeur and magnificence;
and who shall say that he was mistaken.
Whig and dissenter as he was, no man loved
and reverenced all the old institutions of his
country more fervently than Daniel. He
* The best of Defoe's satirical performances, is Mars
stript of his Armour, 1709. This is one of the rarest of
his works; it contains a lashing caricature of the habits
and manners of all kinds of military men; and is written
throughout, as if on purpose to delight quiet trades-people,
and cure their daughters of their passion for red coats.
triumphs in describing the superior pomp and
dignity with which the Majesty of England
was surrounded at Whitehall; and half
forgets his puritanism beneath the vaults of
Westminster Abbey.—Nothing in the world
is finer than the impression of the old city of
London, before the fire, which one gathers
from his History of the Plague. Throughout
the whole of that most striking narrative, his
mind is visibly haunted with the idea, how
princely was the desolation of her grass-grown
streets—how awful the silence of her deserted
palaces and the fatal calmness of her shipless
river. The historian of the plague of London
was worthy of inspiring a poet—and he has
done so. -
Defoe's love for the sea, and the affairs of
the sea, was another strong and prevailing
part of his character as an Englishman; and
it is traceable more or less in almost all his
writings. Trade was his original destination,
and he understood it thoroughly in all its
branches; his study of the trade of his country
had filled him with a magnificent sense of her
ocean greatness; and no man could have
conceived some of the sublime meditations of
Robinson Crusoe, but a citizen of the Queen
of Isles. It is now a hundred years since
that book was written, and who shall say, how
many young hearts have in that time been
smitten by its means with their first love for the
element of their country's pride. Every English
lad that reads Robinson Crusoe has his little
canoe and his mimic ship, and so long as the
British Jack sweeps the sea, the youngest
boy that rocks upon the mast, will exhibit
there the usefulness of those lessons of reso-
lution and contempt of danger which he
owes to Robinson Crusoe. It is here, indeed,
that the chief value and chief merit of this
performance are to be found. The happy
imagination of the incidents of the mariner's
life, and the profound knowledge of man's
nature which is exhibited in the workings
of his solitary soul, even these would be
comparatively nothing, were it not for the
rich moral aim to which they are made
subservient. The superiority of man to all
external evils, his destination to contend
with difficulties, and his duty to sustain
them, and his pious humility in overcoming
them,-these are the ideas which this the most
moral of all Romances throughout displays
and inculcates. How happy that the book
which, as Dr. Johnson says, “no body ever
laid down without wishing it were longer,” is
not only the most charming of books, but
the most instructive.
The only one of Defoe's cotemporaries
who has given us any description of him, is
John Dunton the bookseller. According to
him, he was “a man of a conversation in-
genious and brisk — of a spirit bold and
enterprising — of good nature and real
honesty.” The character corresponds very
well with what we might infer from the
writings of the man. In spite of some pieces,
in which vice is painted so distinctly that it
almost looks as if it had been painted con
amore, there seems no reason to doubt that
his purposes were honest — that he was a
sincere Christian in his heart, and a devout
lover of his country's welfare. The defects
of his education, or rather the circumstances
of his birth and station, have given a strain
of coarseness to his style and manner which
must prevent him ever from being joined
with the purest classics of England; but for
richness of natural genius, for nature, elo-
quence, and for variety of useful knowledge,
it may be safely asserted that there are very
few among their number who can sustain :
any comparison with Daniel Defoe. He has
been much commended and much imitated;
but in many of his walks (for few writers ever
had more walks than he) he has never been
equalled.
Daniel Defoe closed his useful and labo-
rious life in St. Giles's, Cripplegate, the parish
where he was born, in April 1731, at the age
of 68. He left behind him two sons, of
whom one emigrated to Carolina: of the
other nothing is known. He left also three
daughters, one of whom was married to the
celebrated Henry Baker. It is not known
whether any of his race be still preserved,
either here or in America.

THE designs from which the Embellish-
ments of this Edition are taken, were exe-
cuted many years ago; but the Engravings
from them which were then published were
executed so inadequately to the present state
of the Arts, that it is no wonder the Public
shewed little sense of their extraordinary
merit. Now at length entire justice has been
done to the genius of the celebrated Painter,
VOL. I. e
who conceived these admirable illustrations.
—So much the present Publishers think they
may venture to say, without incurring the
blame of any lover of the fine arts of his
country.

readful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep: I
looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster in-
deed, for it was a terrible great lion that lay on the side of

These, Sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives
to you; and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he
let them know who I was ; upon which they all came up
one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordinary
fellows, and I the like, but really as if they had been ambas-
sadors or noblemen, and I a monarch or a great conque-
ror.” Page 48.

THE PLANTATION OF THE TWO ENGLISHMEN.
“The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their hut, that when you came to the place, nothing
was to be seen but a wood; and though they had their
plantation twice demolished, once by their own countrymen,
and once by the enemy, as shall be shewn in its place; yet
they had restored all again, and every thing was flourishing
and thriving about them.” Page 102.

faithful to them, to lead them with their two wives, and
whatever they could carry away with them, to their retired
place in the woods.” Page 108.

PLATE XXI.
CHINESE GENTLEMAN AT HIS REPAST.
“He sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, being a
heavy corpulent man, and his meat being brought him by
two women slaves; he had two more, whose office, I think,
few gentlemen in Europe would accept of their service in,
viz. one fed the 'squire with a spoon, and the other held the
dish with one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon
his worship's beard and taffety vest, with the other.”

their own affairs, and to have no design upon us.”

PR E FA C E
TO THE
F I R S T E D IT I O N.
If ever the story of any private man's adven-
tures in the world were worth making pub-
lic, and were acceptable when published, the
Editor of this account thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man’s life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the
life of one man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with se-
riousness, and with a religious application of
events to the uses to which wise men always
apply them; viz. to the instruction of others,
by this example, and to justify and honour
the wisdom of Providence in all the variety
of our circumstances, let them happen how
they will.
-
xcii PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
The Editor believes the thing to be a just
history of facts; neither is there any appear-
ance offiction in it; and however thinks, be-
cause all such things are disputed, that the
improvement of it, as well to the diversion, as
to the instruction of the Reader, will be the
same; and as such, he thinks, without further
compliment to the world, he does them a
great service in the publication.
THE
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
&c.
I was born in the year 1682, in the city of York,
of a good family, though not of that country, my
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at Hull; he got a good estate by merchandize,
and leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York;
from whence he had married my mother, whose
relations were named Robinson, a very good family
in that country, and from whom I was called
Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption
of words in England, we are now called, nay we
call ourselves, and write our name Crusoe, and so
my companions always called me.
I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieu-
tenant colonel to an English regiment of foot in
WOL. I. B
2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous colo-
nel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dun-
kirk against the Spaniards; what became of my
second brother I never knew, any more than my
father or mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early
with rambling thoughts: my father, who was very
ancient, had given me a competent share of learning,
as far as house education, and a country free-school
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ;
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay the commands of my father, and
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be
something fatal in that propension of nature tending
directly to the life of misery which was to befal me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was
my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this sub-
ject: he asked me what reasons more than a mere
wandering inclination I had for leaving my father's
house and my native country, where I might be
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my
fortune by application and industry, with a life of
ease and pleasure. He told me it was for men of
desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring su-
perior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon

adventures, to rise by enterprize, and make them-
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of
the common road; that these things were all either
too far above me, or too far below me; that mine
was the middle state, or what might be called the
upper station of low life, which he had found by
long experience was the best state in the world, the
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings
of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar-
rassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might
judge of the happiness of this state, by this one
thing, viz. That this was the state of life which all
other people envied; that Kings have frequently
lamented the miserable consequences of being born
to great things, and wish they had been placed in
the middle of the two extremes, between the mean
and the great; that the wise man gave his testi-
mony to this as the just standard of true felicity
when he prayed to have neither poverty or riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the mid-
dle station had the fewest disasters, and was not
exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind; nay, they were not sub-
jected to so many distempers and uneasinesses
either of body or mind, as those were, who by
vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and
B 2
mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring
distempers upon themselves by the natural conse-
quences of their way of living; that the middle
station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues
and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty
were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society,
all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures,
were the blessings attending the middle station of
life; that this way men went silently and smoothly
through the world, and comfortably out of it, not
embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of
the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily
bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances,
which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest;
not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in
easy circumstances sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day’s experience to know it
more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the
most affectionate manner, not to play the young
man, not to precipitate myself into miseries which
nature and the station of life I was born in seemed
to have provided against; that I was under no ne-
cessity of seeking my bread; that he would do
well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into
the station of life which he had been just recom-
mending to me; and that if I was not very easy
and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate
or fault that must hinder it, and that he should
have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged
his duty in warning me against measures which
he knew would be to my hurt: in a word, that as
he would do very kind things for me if I wöuld
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to
give me any encouragement to go away : and to
close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an
example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuasions to keep him from going into the low
country wars, but could not prevail, his young de-
sires prompting him to run into the army, where
he was killed; and though he said he would not
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, GoD
would not bless me, and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel
when there might be none to assist in my re-
covery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse,
which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my
father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I
observed the tears run down his face very plenti-
fully, and especially when he spoke of my brother
who was killed; and that when he spoke of my
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he
was so moved, that he broke off the discourse, and
told me, his heart was so full, he could say no
more to me.
B 3
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as
indeed who could be otherwise 2 and I resolved
not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle.
at home according to my father’s desire. But alas!
a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent
any of my father's further importunities, in a few
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act so hastily neither as my
first heat of resolution prompted, but I took my
mother, at a time when I thought her a little plea-
santer than ordinary, and told her, that mythoughts
were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that
I should never settle to any thing with resolution
enough to go through with it, and my father had
better give me his consent than force me to go
without it; that I was now eighteen years old,
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or
clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I
should never serve out my time, and I should cer-
tainly run away from my master before my time
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to
my father to let me go but one voyage abroad, if I
came home again and did not like it, I would go
no more, and I would promise by a double dili-
gence to recover that time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion: she
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to
speak to my father upon any such subject; that he
knew too well what was my interest to give his
consent to any thing so much for my hurt, and
that she wondered how I could think of any
such thing after such a discourse as I had had with
my father, and such kind and tender expressions
as she knew my father had used to me; and that
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help
for me; but I might depend I should never have
their consent to it; that for her part she would
not have so much hand in my destruction; and I
should never have it to say, that my mother was
willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my
father, yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported
all the discourse to him, and that my father, after
shewing a great concern at it, said to her with a
sigh, “That boy might be happy if he would stay
at home, but if he goes abroad, he will be the most
miserable wretch that was ever born; I can give
no consent to it.”
It was not till almost a year after this that I
broke loose, though in the mean time I continued
obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to busi-
ness, and frequently expostulating with my father
and mother about their being so positively deter-
mined against what they knew my inclinations
prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where
I went casually, and without any purpose of mak-
ing an elopement that time; but I say, being there,
and one of my companions being going by sea to
London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to
go with them, with the common allurement of sea-
faring men, viz. That it should cost me nothing
for my passage, I consulted neither father or mo-
B 4
ther any more, not so much as sent them word of
it: but leaving them to hear of it as they might,
without asking God's blessing, or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or con-
sequences, and in an ill hour, GoD knows, on the
first of September 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for London: never any young adventurer’s
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten
out of the Humber, but the wind began to blow,
and the waves to rise in a most frightful manner;
and as I had never been at sea before, I was most
inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind:
I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had
done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg-
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's
house, and abandoning my duty; all the good
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my
mother's entreaties came now fresh into my mind,
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, re-
proached me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea,
which I had never been upon before, went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since; no, nor like what I saw a few days
after: but it was enough to affect me then, who
was but a young sailor, and had never known any
thing of the matter. I expected every wave would
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship
fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow
of the sea, we should never rise more; and in this
agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions,
that if it would please God here to spare my life
this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon
dry land again I would go directly home to my
father, and never set it into a ship again while I
lived; that I would take his advice, and never
run myself into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observa-
tions about the middle station of life, how easy,
how comfortably he had lived all his days, and
never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or
troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would,
like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my
father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next day the wind was abated and
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to
it: however I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and
a charming fine evening followed; the sun went
down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morn-
ing; and having little or no wind, and a smooth
sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with
wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible
the day before, and could be so calm and so plea-
sant in so little time after. And now, lest my
good resolutions should continue, my companion
who had indeed inticed me away, comes to me,
• Well, Bob,” says he, (clapping me upon the
shoulder,) “how do you do after it? I warrant you
were frighted, wan’t you, last night, when it blew
but a cap full of wind?” “A cap full do you call it?”
said I. “It was a terrible storm.” “A storm, you
fool you,” replies he, “do you call that a storm 2
why it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship
and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a
squall of wind as that; but you’re but a fresh-water
sailor, Bob: come, let us make a bowl of punch,
and we’ll forget all that: do you see what charm-
ing weather it is now * To make short this sad part
of my story, we went the old way of all sailors;
the punch was made, and I was made drunk with
it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned
all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past
conduct, and all my resolutions for my future. In
a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the cur-
rent of my former desires returned, I entirely for-
got the vows and promises that I made in my dis-
tress. I found indeed some intervals of reflection,
and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour
to return again sometimes, but I shook them off,
and roused myself from them as it were from a
distemper, and applying myself to drink and
company, soon mastered the return of those fits,
for so I called them, and I had in five or six days
got as complete a victory over conscience as any
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with
it could desire. But I was to have another trial
for it still ; and Providence, as in such cases gene-
rally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without
excuse. For if I would not take this for a deli-
verance, the next was to be such a one as the worst
and most hardened wretch among us would con-
fess both the danger and the mercy. -
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come
to an anchor, and here welay, the wind continuing
contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight
days, during which time a great many ships from
Newcastle came into the same roads, as the com-
mon harbour where the ships might wait for a
wind for the river.
We had not however rid here so long, but should
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew
too fresh; and after we had lain four or five days,
blew very hard. However the roads being reck-
oned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of
danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea; but the eighth day in the
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands
at work to strike our top-masts, and make every
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as
easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high
indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped seve-
ral seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor
had come home; upon which our master ordered
out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two
anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to the
better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed;
and now I began to see terror and amazement in
the faces even of the seamen themselves. The
master, though vigilant in the business of preserv-
ing the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin
by me, I could hear him softly to himself say
several times, ‘Lord, be merciful to us, we shall be
all lost, we shall be all undone;” and the like. Du-
ring these first hurries, I was stupid, lying still in
my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot
describe my temper: I could ill re-assume the first
penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon,
and hardened myself against: I thought the bitter-
ness of death had been past, and that this would
be nothing like the first. But when the master
himself came by me, as I said just now, and said
we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted; I
got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such
a dismal sight I never saw : the sea went moun-
tains high, and broke upon us every three or four
minutes: when I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round us: two ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board,
being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a
ship which rid about a mile a-head of us was foun-
dered. Two more ships being driven from their
anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all
adventures, and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much la-
bouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove,
and came close by us, running away with only their
spritsail out before the wind.
Towards evening the mate and boatswain beg-
ged the master of our ship to let them cut away
the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do:
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the ship would founder, he consented; and
when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-
mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much,
they were obliged to cut her away also, and make
a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who
had been in such a fright before at but a little.
But if I can express at this distance the thoughts
I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more
horror of mind upon account of my former con-
victions, and the having returned from them to
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than
I was at death itself; and these, added to the ter-
ror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that
I can by no words describe it. But the worst was
not come yet: the storm continued with such fury,
that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had
never known a worse. We had a good ship, but
she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that
the seamen every now and then cried out, she
would founder. It was my advantage in one re-
spect, that I did not know what they meant by
founder, till I enquired. However, the storm was
so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the
master, the boatswain, and some others more sen-
sible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting
every moment when the ship would go to the bot-
tom. In the middle of the night, and under all
the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had
been down on purpose to see, cried out, we had
sprung a leak; another said there was four foot
water in the hold. Then all hands were called to
the pump. At that very word my heart, as I thought,
died within me, and I fell backwards upon the side
of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However,
the men roused me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump
as another: at which I stirred up, and went to the
pump and worked very heartily. While this was
doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who,
not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip
and run away to sea, and would not come near us,
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I who
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised,
that I thought the ship had broke, or some dread-
ful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time
when every body had his own life to think of, no-
body minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting
me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had
been dead; and it was a great while before I came
to myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet
as it was not possible she could swim till we might
run into a port, so the master continued firing
guns for help; and a light ship who had rid it out
just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near
us, but it was impossible for us to get on board, or
for the boat to lie near the ship's side; till at last,
the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over
the stern with the buoy to it, and then veered it
out a great length, which they after great labour
and hazard took hold of, and we hauled them close
under our stern and got all into their boat. It was
to no purpose for them or us after we were in the
boat to think of reaching to their own ship, so all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in
towards shore as much as we could, and our master
promised them, that if the boat was staved upon
shore he would make it good to their master: so
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went
away to the northward, sloping towards the shore
almost as far as Winterton-Ness. -
We were not much more than a quarter of an
hour out of our ship before we saw her sink, and then
I understood for the first time what was meant by
a ship foundering in the sea; I must acknowledge
I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told
me she was sinking; for from that moment they
rather put me into the boat than that I might be
said to go in : my heart was as it were dead within
me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the
shore, we could see (when our boat mounting the
waves we were able to see the shore) a great many
people running along the shore to assist us when
we should come near, but we made but slow way
towards the shore, nor were we able to reach the
shore, till being past the light-house at Winterton,
the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer,
and so the land broke off a little the violence of the
wind: here we got in, and, though not without
much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfor-
tunate men, we were used with great humanity, as
well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned
us good quarters, as by particular merchants and
owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient
to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as
we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's pa-
rable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for
hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he
had any assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had
several times loud calls from my reason and my
more composed judgment to go home, yet I had
no power to do it. I know not what to call this,
nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own
destruction, even though it be before us, and that
we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly
nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery
attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions
as I had met with in my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me be-
fore, and who was the master's son, was now less
forward than I; the first time he spoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three days, for we were separated in the town to
several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered; and looking very me-
lancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I
did, and telling his father who I was, and how I
VOL. I. C
*
had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to
go farther abroad; his father turning to me with
a very grave and concerned tone, Young man,
says he, you ought never to go to sea any more;
you ought to take this for a plain and visible token
that you are not to be a seafaring man. Why,
Sir, said I, will you go to sea no more ? That is
another case, said he, it is my calling, and there-
fore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you
of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps
this is all befallen us on your account, like Jonah
in the ship of Tarshish. Pray, continued he, what
are you? and on what account did you go to sea?
Upon that I told him some of my story; at the
end of which he burst out with a strange kind of
passion; What had I done, says he, that such an
unhappy wretch should come into my ship ! I
would not set my foot in the same ship with thee
again for a thousand pounds. This indeed was,
as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were
yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was far.
ther than he could have authority to go. How-
ever he afterwards talked very gravely to me,
exhorted me to go back to my father and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a
visible hand of Heaven against me; and, young
man, said he, depend upon it, if you do not go
back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing
but disasters and disappointments, till your father's
words are fulfilled upon you.
We parted soon after; for I made him little an-
swer, and I saw him no more; which way he went,
I know not. As for me, having some money in
my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and
there, as well as on the road, had many struggles
with myself, what course of life I should take, and
whether I should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best mo-
tions that offered to my thoughts; and it imme-
diately occurred to me how I should be laughed
at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed
to see, not my father and mother only, but even
every body else; from whence I have since often
observed, how incongruous and irrational the
common temper of mankind is, especially of youth,
to that reason which ought to guide them in such
cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and
yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the
action for which they ought justly to be esteemed
fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only
can make them be esteemed wise men. -
In this state of life however I remained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance
continued to going home; and as I stayed a while,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore
off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in
my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last
I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked
out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away
C 2
from my father's house, that hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune;
and that imprest those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to
the entreaties and even the command of my father:
I say, the same influence, whatever it was, pre-
sented the most unfortunate of all enterprizes to
my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to
the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call
it, a voyage to Guinea. -
It was my great misfortune that in all these ad-
ventures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned
the duty and office of a fore-mast man; and in
time might have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was
always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did
here; for having money in my pocket, and good
clothes upon my back, I would always go on board
in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship, or learned to do any. .
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a
ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and
who having had very good success there, was re-
solved to go again; and who taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at
that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the
world, told me if I would go the voyage with him
I should be at no expence; I should be his mess-
mate and his companion, and if I could carry any
thing with me, I should have all the advantage of
it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might
meet with some encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest
and plain-dealing man, I-went the voyage with
him, and carried a small adventure with me, which
by the disinterested honesty of my friend, the cap-
tain, I increased very considerably; for I carried
about 40l. in such toys and trifles as the captain
directed me to buy. This 40l. I had mustered
together by the assistance of some of my relations
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe,
got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute
so much as that to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe
to the integrity and honesty of my friend the cap-
tain, under whom also I got a competent know-
ledge of the mathematics, and the rules of naviga-
tion, learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to un-
derstand some things that were needful to be un-
derstood by a sailor: for, as he took delight to in-
struct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word,
this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant:
C 3
for I brought home 5 pounds 9 ounces of gold dust
for my adventure, which yielded me in London at
my return, almost 800l., and this filled me with
those aspiring thoughts which have since so com-
pleted my ruin.
Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes
too; particularly, that I was continually sick, being
thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive
heat of the climate; our principal trading being
upon the coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees
north even to the line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again,
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who
was his mate in the former voyage, and had now
got the command of the ship. This was the un-
happiest voyage that ever man made; for though
I did not carry quite 100l. of my new gained
wealth, so that I had 200l. left, and which I lodged
with my friend’s widow, who was very just to me,
yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage ;
and the first was this, viz. Our ship making her
course towards the Canary Islands, or rather be-
tween those islands and the African shore, was
surprised in the grey of the morning, by a Turkish
rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the
sail she could make. We crowded also as much
canvass as our yards would spread, or our masts
carry, to have got clear; but finding the pirate
gained upon us, and would certainly come up with
us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship
having 12 guns, and the rogue 18. About three
in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing
to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of
athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight
of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a
broadside upon him, which made him sheer off
again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also
his small shot from near 200 men which he had
on board. However, we had not a man touched,
all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack
us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying
us on board the next time upon our other quarter,
he entered 60 men upon our decks, who immedi-
ately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and
rigging. We plied them with small shot, half.
pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared
our deck of them twice. However, to cut short
this melancholy part of our story, our ship being
disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car-
ried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the coun-
try to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover, as
his proper prize, and made his slave, being young
and nimble, and fit for his business. At this sur-
prising change of my circumstances, from a mer-
chant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly over-
C 4
whelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be mise-
rable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought
was now so effectually brought to pass, that I could
not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had
overtaken me, and I was undone without redemp-
tion. But, alas! this was but a taste of the misery
I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel
of the story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would some time or other be his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war; and
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away; for when he went
to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little
garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves
about his house; and when he came home again
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin
to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape; and
what method I might take to effect it; but found
no way that had the least probability in it: nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational;
for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotsman, there but myself; so that
for two years, though I often pleased myself with
the imagination, yet I never had the least encou-
raging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head:
my patron lying at home longer than usual, with-
out fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for
want of money, he used constantly, once or twice
a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair,
to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the
road a fishing; and as he always took me and a
young Maresco with him to row the boat, we
made him very merry, and I proved very dexte-
rous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he
would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen,
and the youth, the Maresco as they called him, to
catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing in a
stark calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the shore,
we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not
whither or which way, we laboured all day, and
all the next night, and when the morning came
we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pull-
ing in for the shore; and that we were at least
two leagues from the shore: however we got well
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and
some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty
fresh in the morning; but particularly we were all
very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and
having lying by him the long boat of our English
ship he had taken, he resolved he would not go a
fishing any more without a compass and some pro-
vision ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who also was an English slave, to build a little
state-room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat,
like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind
it to steer and hale home the main-sheet; and room
before for a hand or two to stand and work the
sails; she sailed with what we call a shoulder of
mutton sail; and the boom gibed over the top of
the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in
it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a
table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in
some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to
drink; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.
We went frequently out with this boat a fishing,
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened that he
had appointed to go out in this boat, either for
pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of
some distinction in that place, and for whom he
had provided extraordinarily; and had therefore
sent on board the boat over night a larger store of
provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me to
get ready three fusees with powder and shot, which
were on board his ship; for that they designed
some sport of fowling, as well as fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and
waited the next morning with the boat washed
clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his guests; when by and
by my patron came on board alone, and told me
his guests had put off going, upon some business
that fell out, and ordered me with the man and
boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and catch
them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at
his house; and commanded that as soon as I got
some fish I should bring it home to his house; all
which I prepared to do. 4.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was
like to have a little ship at my command; and my
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself,
not for fishing business, but for a voyage; though
I knew not, neither did I so much as consider,
whither I should steer; for any where to get out
of that place was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub-
sistence on board; for I told him we must not
presume to eat of our patron’s bread: he said, that
was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh
water into the boat. I knew where my patron’s
case of bottles stood, which it was evident by the
make were taken out of some English prize; and
I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor
was on shore, as if they had been there before for
our master; I conveyed also a great lump of bees-
wax into the boat, which weighed above half a
hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or thread,
a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of
great use to us afterwards; especially the wax to
make candles. Another trick I tried upon him,
which he innocently came into also ; his name
was Ismael, who they call Muly, or Moley; so I
called to him, Moley, said I, our patron's guns are
on board the boat, can you not get a little powder
and shot, it may be we may kill some Alcamies (a
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know
he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship : Yes,
says he, I’ll bring some; and accordingly he
brought a great leather pouch which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and
another with shot, that had five or six pounds,
with some bullets, and put all into the boat ; at
the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one
of the large bottles in the case, which was almost
empty; pouring what was in it into another: and
thus furnished with every thing needful, we sailed
out of the port to fish. The castle which is at the
entrance of the port knew who we were, and took
no notice of us; and we were not above a mile
out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and set
us down to fish: the wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown
southerly I had been sure to have made the coast
of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz;
but my resolutions were, blow which way it would,
I would be gone from that horrid place where I
was, and leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and catched no-
thing, for when I had fish on my hook I would
not pull them up, that he might not see them; I
said to the Moor, this will not do, our master will
not be thus served, we must stand farther off: he
thinking no harm agreed, and being in the head
of the boat set the sails; and as I had the helm I
run the boat out near a league farther, and then
brought her to as if I would fish, when giving the
boy the helm, I stept forward to where the Moor
was, and making as if I stooped for something
behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm
under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard
into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam
like a cork, and calling to me, begged to be taken
in, told me he would go all over the world with
me; he swam so strong after the boat that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being
but little wind; upon which I stept into the cabin,
and fetching one of the fowling pieces, I presented
it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt,
and if he would be quiet I would do him none:
but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the
shore, and the sea is calm, make the best of your
way to shore, and I will do you no harm, but if
you come near the boat I’ll shoot you through the
head; for I am resolved to have my liberty: so he
turned himself about and swam for the shore, and
I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this
Moor with me, and have drowned the boy, but
there was no venturing to trust him. When he was
gone I turned to the boy, who they called Xury,
and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to
me I’ll make you a great man, but if you will not
stroke your face to be true to me, that is, swear
by Mahomet and his father's beard, I must throw
you into the sea too: the boy smiled in my face,
and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust
him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all
over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat,
rather stretching to windward, that they might
think me gone towards the Straits mouth (as in-
deed any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do), for who would have
supposed we were sailed on to the southward to
the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations of
negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes,
and destroy us; where we could never once go on
shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts,
or more merciless savages of human kind.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little toward the east,
that I might keep in with the shore; and having
a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail that I believe by the next day at
three o’clock in the afternoon, when I first made
the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south
of Sallee; quite beyond the emperor of Morocco's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts,
for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the
Moors, and the dreadful apprehensions I had of
falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or
go on shore, or come to an anchor. The wind con-
tinuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five
days, and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels
were in chace of me, they also would now give
over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and
came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river,
I knew not what, or where; neither what latitude,
what country, what nation, or what river: I nei-
ther saw, or desired to see any people, the princi-
pal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came
into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim
on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the
country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard
such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and
howling of wild creatures of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear,
and begged of me not to go on shore till day.
Well, Xury, said I, then I wont, but it may be we
may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as
those lions. Then we give them the shoot gun,
says Xury, laughing; make them run wey. Such
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves.
However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful,
and I gave him a dram (out of our patron's case
of bottles) to cheer him up: after all, Xury's ad-
vice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little
anchor and lay still all night; I say still, for we
slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast
great creatures (we knew not what to call them)
of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run
into the water, wallowing and washing themselves
for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
I too; but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of these mighty creatures come swim-
ming towards our boat: we could not see him, but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
strous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a
lion, and it might be so for aught I know ; but
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and
row away. No, says I, Xury, we can slip our cable
with a buoy to it and go off to sea, they cannot
follow us far. I had no sooner said so, but I per-
ceived the creature (whatever it was) within two
oars length, which something surprised me; how-
ever I immediately stept to the cabin-door, and
taking up my gun fired at him, upon which he
immediately turned about, and swam towards the
shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible
noises, and hideous cries and howlings, that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore, as higher
within the country, upon the noise or report of
the gun; a thing I have some reason to believe
those creatures had never heard before : this con-
vinced me that there was no going on shore for
us in the night upon that coast, and how to ven-
ture on shore in the day was another question too;
for to have fallen into the hands of any of the
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the
hands of lions and tigers; at least we were equally
apprehensive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had
not a pint left in the boat; when or where to get
to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him
go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if
there was any water and bring some to me. I
asked him why he would go? why I should not
go and he stay in the boat? The boy answered
with so much affection that made me love him ever
after. Says he, If wild mans come, they eat me,
you go wey. Well, Xury, said I, we will both
go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them,
they shall eat neither of us; so I gave Xury a
piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of our
patron’s case of bottles which I mentioned before ;
and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on shore; carrying
nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat,
fearing the coming of canoes with savages down
the river: but the boy seeing a low place about a
mile up the country rambled to it; and by and by
I saw him come running towards me. I thought
VOL. I. p
he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him
to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I
saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but
different in colour, and longer legs; however we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was
to tell me he had found good water, and seen no
wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water; for a little higher up the
creek where we were, we found the water fresh
when the tide was out, which flowed but a little
way up; so we filled our jars and feasted on the
hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
way, having seen no foot-steps of any human
creature in that part of the country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before,
I knew very well that the islands of the Canaries,
and the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off
from the coast. But as I had no instruments to
take an observation to know what latitude we were
in, and did not exactly know, or at least remem-
ber, what latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to stand off to
sea towards them; otherwise I might now easily
have found some of these islands. But my hope
was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to
that part where the English traded, I should find
some of their vessels upon their usual design of
trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where
I now was, must be that country, which lying be-
tween the emperor of Morocco's dominions and
the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except
by wild beasts; the Negroes having abandoned
it, and gone farther south for fear of the Moors;
and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting,
by reason of its barrenness; and indeed both for-
saking it because of the prodigious number of
tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures
which harbour there; so that the Moors use it for
their hunting only, where they go like an army,
two or three thousand men at a time ; and indeed
for near an hundred miles together upon this coast,
we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country
by day; and heard nothing but howlings and roar-
ing of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day-time I thought I saw
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the
mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a
great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching
thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrary winds, the sea also going too
high for my little vessel, so I resolved to pursue
my first design and keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh
water, after we had left this place; and once in
particular, being early in the morning, we came
to an anchor under a little point of land which was
pretty high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay
still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more
D 2
about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to
me, and tells me that we had best go farther off
the shore; for, says he, look yonder lies a dread-
ful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep.
I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful
monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a
piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over
him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill
36 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
eat me at one mouth ; one mouthful he meant.
However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him
lie still; and took our biggest gun, which was
almost musquet-bore, and loaded it with a good
charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it
down; then I loaded another gun with two bul- .
lets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I
loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best
aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him
into the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a
little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about
the knee, and broke the bone. He started up
growling at first, but finding his leg broke fell
down again, and then got up upon three legs, and
gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I
was a little surprised that I had not hit him on
the head; however, I took up the second piece
immediately, and, though he began to move off,
fired again, and shot him into the head, and had
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little
noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury

took heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
Well, go, said I. So the boy jumped into the water,
and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore
with the other hand, and coming close to the crea-
ture, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and
shot him into the head again, which dispatched
him quite. -
This was game indeed to us, but this was no
food: and I was very sorry to lose three charges
of powder and shot upon a creature that was good
for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would
have some of him ; so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. For what,
Xury 2 said I. Me cut off his head, said he.
However, Xury could not cut off his head, but he
cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was
a monstrous great one. -
I bethought myself however, that perhaps the
skin of him might one way or other be of some
value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him ;
but Xury was much the better workman at it, for
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us
up both the whole day; but at last we got off the
hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our
cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days time,
and it afterwards served me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward
continually for ten or twelve days, living very
sparing on our provisions, which began to abate
very much, and going no oftener into the shore
D 3
than we were obliged to for fresh water: my de-
sign in this was, to make the river Gambia or Se-
negal, that is to say, any where about the Cape de
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some
European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what
course I had to take, but to seek for the Islands,
or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that
all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to
the coast of Guinea or to Brasil, or to the East In-
dies, made this Cape, or those Islands; and, in a
word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some
ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten
days longer, as I have said, I began to see that the
land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as
we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore
to look at us; we could also perceive they were
quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was
my better counsellor, and said to me, No go, no
go: however I hauled in nearer the shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they ran along
the shore by me a good way. I observed they had
no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a
long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance,
and that they would throw them a great way with
good aim. So I kept at a distance, but talked with
them by signs as well as I could; and particularly
made signs for something to eat: they beckoned
to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me
some meat; upon this I lowered the top of my
sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than half an hour came back,
and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what the one nor
the other was: however, we were willing to accept
it, but how to come at it was our next dispute, for
I was not for venturing on shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore
and laid it down, and went and stood a great way
off till we fetched it on board, and then came close
to us again. -
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
offered that very instant to oblige them wonder-
fully; for while we were lying by the shore, came
two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as
we took it) with great fury, from the mountains
towards the sea: whether it was the male pursuing
the female, or whether they were in sport or in
rage, we could not tell, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe
it was the latter; because, in the first place, those
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night;
and in the second place, we found the people ter-
ribly frighted, especially the women. The man
that had the lance or dart did not fly from them,
but the rest did ; however, as the two creatures
ran directly into the water, they did not seem to
D 4
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged
themselves into the sea, and swam about as if they
had come for their diversion. At last one of them
began to come nearer our boat than at first I ex-
pected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly
within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly
into the head. Immediately he sunk down into
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and
down as if he was struggling for life; and so in-
deed he was: he immediately made to the shore,
but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt,
and the strangling of the water, he died just be-
fore he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my
gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear,
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to
the shore, they took heart and came to the shore,
and began to search for the creature. I found him
by his blood staining the water; and by the help
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and
found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted
and fine to an admirable degree, and the Negroes
held up their hands with admiration to think what
it was I had killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they
came, nor could I at that distance know what it
was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eat-
ing the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to
have them take it as a favour from me, which
when I made signs to them that they might take
him, they were very thankful for. Immediately
they fell to work with him, and though they had
no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they
took off his skin as readily, and much more readily,
than we could have done with a knife: they offered
me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as
if I would give it them, but made signs for the
skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provision, which
though I did not understand, yet I accepted; then
I made signs to them for some water, and held out
one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward,
to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted to
have it filled. They called immediately to some
of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as
I suppose, in the sun; this they set down for me,
as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars,
and filled them all three. The women were as
stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such
as it was, and water: and, leaving my friendly
Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days
more, without offering to go near the shore, till I
saw the land run out a great length into the sea,
at about the distance of four or five leagues before
me; and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing to make this point: at length, doubling the
point at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side to seaward; then I
concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this
was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands, called
from thence Cape de Verd Islands. However,
they were at a great distance, and I could not well
tell what I had best to do, for if I should be taken
with a fresh of wind I might neither reach one nor
the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stept
into the cabin and set me down, Xury having the
helm, when on a sudden the boy cried out, Master,
master, a ship with a sail! and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when
I knew we were gotten far enough out of their
reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immedi-
ately saw not only the ship, but what she was, (viz.)
that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes.
But when I observed the course she steered, I was
soon convinced they were bound some other way,
and did not design to come any nearer to the
shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as
much as I could, resolving to speak with them if
possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they
would be gone by before I could make any signal
to them. But after I had crowded to the utmost,
and began to despair; they, it seems, saw me by
the help of their perspective-glasses, and that it
was some European boat, which, as they supposed,
must belong to some ship that was lost; so they
shortened sail to let me come up. I was encou-
raged with this, and as I had my patron’s ancient
on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal
of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw;
for they told me they saw the smoke, though they
did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they
very kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me, and in
about three hours time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and
in Spanish, and in French; but I understood none
of them ; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on
board, called to me, and I answered him, and told
him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee.
Then they bade me come on board, and very kindly
took me in, and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
would believe that I was thus delivered, as I
esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost
hopeless condition as I was in, and immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously told
me, he would take nothing from me, but that all
I had should be delivered safe to me when I came
to the Brasils; for, says he, I have saved your
life on no other terms than I would be glad to be
saved myself; and it may one time or other be my
lot to be taken up in the same condition: Besides,
said he, when I carry you to the Brasils, so great
a way from your own country, if I should take
from you what you have, you will be starved there,
and then I only take away that life I have given.
No, no, Seignior Inglese, says he, Mr. Englishman,
I will carry you thither in charity, and those things
will help you to buy your subsistence there, and
your passage home again.
As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle, for he ordered
the seamen, that none should offer to touch any
thing I had ; then he took every thing into his
own possession, and gave me back an exact inven-
tory of them, that I might have them; even so
much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship’s use, and asked me what I would have for it?
I told him, he had been so generous to me in every
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of his hand
to pay me 80 pieces of eight for it at Brasil; and
when it came there, if any one offered to give
more, he would make it up; he offered me also 60
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I
was loth to take; not that I was not willing to
let the captain have him, but I was very loth to
sell the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so
faithfully in procuring my own. However, when
I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just,
and offered me this medium, that he would give
the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years,
if he turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury say-
ing he was willing to go to him, I let the captain
have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All-
Saints-Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And
now I was once more delivered from the most mi-
serable of all conditions of life, and what to do
next with myself I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me,
I can never enough remember; he would take
nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused
every thing I had in the ship to be punctually de-
livered me; and what I was willing to sell he
bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I
had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made
about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with
this stock I went on shore in the Brasils.
I had not been long here, but being recom-
mended to the house of a good honest man like
himself, who had an Ingenio as they call it; that
is, a plantation and a sugar house, I lived with
him some time, and acquainted myself by that
means with the manner of their planting and mak-
ing of sugar; and seeing how well the planters
lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved,
if I could get license to settle there, I would turn
planter among them, resolving in the mean time
to find out some way to get my money, which I
had left in London, remitted to me. To this pur-
pose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization,
I purchased as much land that was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my
plantation and settlement, and such a one as might
be suitable to the stock which I proposed to my-
self to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of English parents, whose name was Wells,
and in much such circumstances as I was. I call
him neighbour, because his plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My
stock was but low, as well as his ; and we rather
planted for food, than any thing else, for about
two years. However, we began to increase, and
our land began to come into order; so that the
third year we planted some tobacco, and made each
of us a large piece of ground ready for planting
canes in the year to come; but we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had
done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.
But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did
right, was no great wonder: I had no remedy but
to go on; I was gotten into an employment quite
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the
life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and broke through all his good ad-
vice; nay, I was coming into the very middle
station, or upper degree of low life, which my fa.
ther advised me to before; and which if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home,
and never have fatigued myself in the world as I
had done: and I used often to say to myself, I
could have done this as well in England among
my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off
to do it, among strangers and savages in a wilder-
ness, and at such distance as never to hear from
any part of the world that had the least knowledge
of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour: no work
to be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I
used to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon
some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been, and how should
all men reflect, that, when they compare their pre-
sent conditions with others that are worse, Hea-
ven may oblige them to make the exchange, and
be convinced of their former felicity, by their ex-
perience; I say how just has it been, that the truly
solitary life I reflected on in an island of mere de-
solation should be my lot, who had so often un-
justly compared it with the life which I then led,
in which, had I continued, I had in all probability
been exceeding prosperous and rich.
I was in some degree settled in my measures
for carrying on the plantation, before my kind
friend the captain of the ship, that took me up at
sea, went back; for the ship remained there, in
providing his loading, and preparing for his voy-
age, near three months; when telling him what
little stock I had left behind me in London, he
gave me this friendly and sincere advice: Seignor
Inglese, says he, (for so he always called me) if you
will give me letters, and a procuration here in
form to me, with orders to the person who has
your money in London, to send your effects to
Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in
such goods as are proper for this country, I will
bring you the produce of them, God willing, at
my return; but since human affairs are all subject
to changes and disasters, I would have you give
orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which
you say is half your stock, and let the hazard be
run for the first; so that if it come safe, you may
order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry,
you may have the other half to have recourse to
for your supply.
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was
the best course I could take; so I accordingly pre-
pared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had
left my money, and a procuration to the Portu-
guese captain, as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full ac-
count of all my adventures, my slavery, escape,
and how I had met with the Portugal captain at
sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what con-
dition I was now in, with all other necessary
directions for my supply; and when this honest
captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some
of the English merchants there, to send over, not
the order only, but a full account of my story, to
a merchant at London, who represented it effec-
tually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered
the money, but out of her own pocket sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had
written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon,
and he brought them all safe to me to the Brasils;
among which, without my direction (for I was too
young in my business to think of them) he had
taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and
utensils necessary for my plantation, and which
were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my
good steward the captain had laid out the five
pounds which my friend had sent him for a pre-
sent for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a
servant under bond for six years service, and would
not accept of any consideration, except a little to-
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of
my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
VOI. I. E
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize,
and things particularly valuable and desirable in
the country, I found means to sell them to a very
great advantage, so that I may say I had more
than four times the value of my first cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I
mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for
the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and
an European servant also ; I mean another besides
that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it
with me. I went on the next year with great
success in my plantation : I raised fifty great rolls
of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours;
and these fifty rolls, being each of above an hun-
dred weight, were well cured and laid by against
the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now,
increasing in business and in wealth, my head be-
gan to be full of projects and undertakings beyond
my reach ; such as are indeed often the ruin of the
best heads in this business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet retired life, and of which he had
so sensibly described the middle station of life to
be full; but other things attended me, and I was
still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries;
and particularly to increase my fault, and double
the reflections upon myself, which in my future
sorrows I should have leisure to make. All these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obsti-
nate adhering to my foolish inclination of wander-
ing abroad, and pursuing that inclination in con-
tradiction to the clearest views of doing myself
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects
and those measures of life, which nature and Pro-
vidence concurred to present me with, and to
make my duty.
As I had done thus in breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I
cast myself down again into the deepest gulph of
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps
could be consistent with life and a state of health
in the world.
To come then by the just degrees to the parti-
culars of this part of my story; you may suppose,
that having now lived almost four years in the
Brasils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very
well upon my plantation, I had not only learned
the language, but had contracted acquaintance and
friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as
among the merchants at St. Salvadore, which was
our port; and that in my discourses among them,
I had frequently given them an account of my two
E 2
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of
trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it
was to purchase upon the coast, for trifles, such as
beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits of glass,
and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains,
elephants teeth, &c. but Negroes for the service of
the Brasils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but
as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal,
and engrossed in the public, so that few Negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talk-
ing of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me the next morning, and told me they
had been musing very much upon what I had dis-
coursed with them of the last night, and they came
to make a secret proposal to me; and after enjoin-
ing me secrecy, they told me, that they had a
mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they
had all plantations as well as I, and were strait-
ened for nothing so much as servants; that as it
was a trade could not be carried on, because they
could not publicly sell the Negroes when they
came home; so they desired to make but one voy-
age, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and in
a word, the question was, whether I would go their
supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part
upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that
I should have my equal share of the Negroes, with-
out providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed,
had it been made to any one that had not had a
settlement and plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to be very con-
siderable, and with a good stock upon it. But for
me, that was thus entered and established, and had
nothing to do but go on as I begun, for three or
four years more, and to have sent for the other
hundred pounds from England, and who in that
time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth three or four thousand
pounds sterling, and that increasing too; for me
to think of such a voyage, was the most prepos-
terous thing that ever man in such circumstances
could be guilty of
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them
I would go with all my heart, if they would under-
take to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct
if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and
entered into writings or covenants to do so; and
I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation
E 8
and effects, in case of my death, making the cap-
tain of the ship that had saved my life as before,
my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of
my effects as I had directed in my will, one half
of the produce being to himself, and the other to
be shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my effects, and keep up my plantation; had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own
interest, and have made a judgment of what I
ought to have done, and not to have done, I had
certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a
thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to
sea, attended with all its common hazards; to say
nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular
misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason: and
accordingly the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour, the 1st of September, being the same day
eight years that I went from my father and mother
at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority,
and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about 120 ton burthen, carried 6
guns, and 14 men, besides the master, his boy and
myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the
negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd
trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scis-
sars, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail,
standing away to the northward upon our own
coast, with design to stretch over for the African
coast, when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of
northern latitude, which it seems was the manner
of their course in those days. We had very good
weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon our
own coast, till we came the height of Cape St.
Augustino; from whence keeping farther off at
sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were
bound for the isle Fernand de Noronha, holding
our course N. E. by N. and leaving those isles on
the east. In this course we passed the line in about
twelve days time, and were by our last observation
in 7 degrees 22 min. northern latitude, when a
violent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of
our knowledge: it began from the south-east, came
about to the north-west, and then settled into the
north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve days together we could do
nothing but drive; and scudding away before it,
let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury of the
winds directed; and during these twelve days, I
need not say that I expected every day to be swal-
lowed up, nor indeed did any in the ship expect to
save their lives.
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and
one man and the boy washed overboard. About
E 4 *
the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the
master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was in about 11 degrees north
latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of longitude
difference west from Cape St. Augustino; so that
he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guinea,
or the north part of Brasil, beyond the river Ama-
zones, toward that of the river Oronoque, commonly
called the Great River, and began to consult with
me what course he should take, for the ship was
leaky and very much disabled, and he was going
directly back to the coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that; and looking over
the charts of the sea-coasts of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited country for
us to have recourse to, till we came within the
circle of the Caribbee-islands, and therefore re-
solved to stand away for Barbadoes, which by
keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay
or gulph of Mexico, we might easily perform, as
we hoped, in about fifteen days sail; whereas we
could not possibly make our voyage to the coast
of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship
and to ourselves. -
With this design we changed our course, and
steered away N. W. by W. in order to reach some
of our English islands, where I hoped for relief;
but our voyage was otherwise determined; for being
in the latitude of 12 deg. 18 min. a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the
same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of
the very way of all human commerce, that had all
our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather
in danger of being devoured by savages than ever
returning to our country. -
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men early in the morning cried out,
land! and we had no sooner ran out of the cabin
to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the
world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand,
and in a moment, her motion being so stopped,
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we
expected we should all have perished immediately;
and we were immediately driven into our close
quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and
spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in
the like condition, to describe or conceive the con-
sternation of men in such circumstances: we knew
nothing where we were, or upon what land it was
we were driven, whether an island or the main,
whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the
rage of the wind was still great, though rather
less than at first, we could not so much as hope to
have the ship hold many minutes without breaking
in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle
should turn immediately about. In a word, we
sat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting accordingly
as preparing for another world, for there was little
or nothing more for us to do in this: that which
was our present comfort, and all the comfort we
had, was, that contrary to our expectation the ship
did not break yet, and that the master said the
wind began to abate. -
Now though we found that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the
sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her
getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our
lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our
stern, just before the storm, but she was first staved
by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the
next place she broke away, and either sunk or was
driven off to sea, so there was no hope from her;
we had another boat on board, but how to get her
off into the sea was a doubtful thing : however,
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the
ship would break in pieces every minute, and some
told us she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the
men, they got her slung over the ship's side, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed our-
selves, being eleven in number, to God’s mercy,
and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated
considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon
the shore, and might well be called, den wild zee,
as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for
we all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that
the boat could not live, and that we should be in-
evitably drowned. As to making sail, we had
none, nor, if we had, could we have done any thing
with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to exe-
cution: for we all knew, that when the boat came
nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we
committed our souls to God in the most earnest
manner, and the wind driving us towards the shore,
we hastened our destruction with our own hands,
pulling as well as we could towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whe-
ther steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope
that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation, was, if we might happen into some bay
or gulph, or the mouth of some river, where by great
chance we might have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.
But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked
more frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling a-stern of us, and
plainly bade us expect the coup-de-grace. In a
word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset
the boat at once; and separating us, as well from
the boat as from one another, gave us not time
hardly to say, O God! for we were all swallowed
up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water; for
though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver
myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till
that wave having driven me, or rather carried me
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent
itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost
dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had
so much presence of mind as well as breath left,
that seeing myself nearer the main land than I ex-
pected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to
make on towards the land as fast as I could, before
another wave should return and take me up again.
But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it;
for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great
hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had no
means or strength to contend with ; my business
was to hold my breath, and rise myself upon the
water, if I could : and so by swimming to preserve
my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore,
if possible: my greatest concern now being that
the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards
the shore when it came on, might not carry me
back again with it when it gave back towards the
Sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once 20 or 30 foot deep in its own body; and I
could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore, a very great way;
but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to
burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt my-
self rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found
ºrial..…ini ºr ºr 1.1, ºv, ºr ºr A * L-º-º: ºr 5 , ºr-Arº-1--> -º


my head and hands shoot out above the surface of
the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved
me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I
was covered again with water a good while, but
not so long but I held it out; and finding the
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt
ground again with my feet. I stood still a few
moments to recover breath, and till the water went
from me, and then took to my heels, and run with
what strength I had farther towards the shore.
But neither would this deliver me from the fury
of the sea, which came pouring in after me again,
and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and
carried forwards as before, the shore being very
flat.
The last time of these two had well near been
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along
as before, landed me, or rather dashed me against
a piece of a rock, and that with such force, as it
left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and
breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my
body; and had it not returned again immediately,
I must have been strangled in the water; but I
recovered a little before the return of the waves,
and seeing I should be covered again with the
water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the
wave went back. Now as the waves were not so
high as at first, being near land, I held my hold
till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
which brought me so near the shore, that the next
wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swal-
low me up as to carry me away; and the next run
I took I got to the main land, where, to my great
comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the shore,
and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger,
and quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began
to look up and thank God that my life was saved
in a case wherein there was some minutes before
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossi-
ble to express to the life what the ecstacies and
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I
may say, out of the very grave; and I do not won-
der now at that custom, viz. that when a malefac-
tor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied up,
and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve
brought to him : I say, I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and
overwhelm him :
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in
the contemplation of my deliverance, making a
thousand gestures and motions which I cannot
describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that
were drowned, and that there should not be one
soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never
saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfort.
able part of my condition, I began to look round
me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what
was next to be done; and I soon found my com-
forts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful
deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift
me, nor any thing either to eat or drink to com-
fort me; neither did I see any prospect before
me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being
devoured by wild beasts: and that which was par-
ticularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no wea-
pon either to hunt and kill any creature for my
sustenance, or to defend myself against any other
creature that might desire to kill me for theirs: in
a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a to-
bacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was
all my provision, and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like
a mad-man; night coming upon me, I began with a
heavy heart to consider what would be mylot if there
were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing
at night they always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw
no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to
drink, which I did, to my great joy; and having
drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to
prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting
up into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as that
if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cut
me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence,
I took up my lodging, and having been excessively
fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my condition,
and found myself the most refreshed with it that I
think I ever was on such an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather
clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did not
rage and swell as before: but that which surprised
me most, was, that the ship was lifted off in the
night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling
of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the
rock which I first mentioned, where I had been so
bruised by the dashing me against it; this being
within about a mile from the shore where I was, and
the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished
myself on board, that, at least, I might save some
necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I looked about me again, and the first thing
I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the
sea had tossed her, up upon the land, about two
miles on my right hand: I walked as far as I could
upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck
or inlet of water between me and the boat, which
was about half a mile broad; so I came back for the
present, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
where I hoped to find something for my present
subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm,
and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come
within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here J
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw
evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had
been all safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left
entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as
I now was: this forced tears from my eyes again,
but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my
clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and
took the water; but when I came to the ship, my
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on
board, for as she lay a-ground, and high out of the
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay
hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second
time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I won-
dered I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-
chains so low as that with great difficulty I got
hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into
WOL. I. F
the forecastle of the ship: here I found that the
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in
her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, and her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost
to the water; by this means all her quarter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry; for
you may be sure my first work was to search and
to see what was spoiled and what was free: and
first I found that all the ship's provisions were
dry, and untouched by the water; and being very
well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and
filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went
about other things, for I had no time to lose. I
also found some rum in the great cabin, of which
I took a large dram, and which I had indeed need
enough of to spirit me for what was before me.
Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish my-
self with many things which I foresaw would be
very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had, and this extremity roused my ap-
plication. We had several spare yards, and two
or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast
or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many of them overboard as I
could manage of their weight, tying every one
with a rope that they might not drive away; when
this was done I went down the ship's side, and
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast toge-
ther at both ends, as well as I could, in the form of
a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk upon
it very well, but that it was not able to bear any
great weight, the pieces being too light; so I went
to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare
top-mast into three lengths, and added them to my
raft, with a great deal of labour and pains: but hope
of furnishing myself with necessaries, encouraged
me to go beyond what I should have been able to
have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any
reasonable weight; my next care was what to load
it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it
from the surf of the sea; but I was not long con-
sidering this ; I first laid all the planks or boards
upon it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, I first got three of the
seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft;
the first of these I filled with provisions, viz. bread,
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's
flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little re-
mainder of European corn which had been laid by
for some fowls which we brought to sea with us,
but the fowls were killed; there had been some
barley and wheat together, but, to my great disap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all; as for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which
were some cordial waters, and in all above five or
six gallons of rack; these Istowed by themselves,
F 2
there being no need to put them into the chest,
nor no room for them. While I was doing this, I
found the tide began to flow, though very calm;
and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt,
and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the
sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which were
only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in
them and my stockings: however, this put me upon
rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough,
but took no more than I wanted for present use,
for I had other things which my eye was more
upon; as, first, tools to work with on shore; and
it was after long searching that I found out the
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful
prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-
loading of gold would have been at that time: I
got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, with-
out losing time to look into it, for I knew in general
what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and
arms: there were two very good fowling-pieces in
the great cabin, and two pistols; these I secured
first, with some powder-horns, and a small bag of
shot, and two old rusty swords: I knew there were
three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gunner had stowed them ; but with
much search I found them, two of them dry and
good, the third had taken water: those two I got
to my raft, with the arms; and now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think
how I should get to shore with them, having nei-
ther sail, oar, or rudder, and the least cap-full of
wind would have overset all my navigation.
I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm
sea: 2. The tide rising and setting into the shore:
8. What little wind there was, blew me towards
the land: and thus, having found two or three
broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the
tools which were in the chest, I found two saws,
an ax and a hammer, and with this cargo I put
to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant
from the place where I had landed before, by
which I perceived that there was some indraft of
the water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of
as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I found a
strong current of the tide set into it, so I guided
my raft as well as I could to keep in the middle
of the stream : but here I had like to have suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily
would have broke my heart; for knowing nothing
of the coast, my raft run a-ground at one end of
it upon a shoal, and not being a-ground at the
other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo
had slipped off towards that end that was afloat,
and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by
setting my back against the chests, to keep them
in their places, but could not thrust off the raft
with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the
F S
posture I was in ; but holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in that manner near half an
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought
me a little more upon a level; and a little after,
the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I
thrust her off with the oar I had, into the channel ;
and then driving up higher, I at length found my-
self in the mouth of a little river, with land on
both sides, and a strong current or tide running
up : I looked on both sides for a proper place to
get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high up the river, hoping in time to see some
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself
as near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore
of the creek, to which, with great pain and diffi-
culty, I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as
that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust
her directly in ; but here I had like to have dipped
all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there was no
place to land, but where one end of the float, if it
run on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo
again : all that I could do, was to wait till the tide
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar
like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the
shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected
the water would flow over; and so it did. As
soon as I found water enough (for my raft drew
about a foot of water), I thrust her on upon that
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored
her by sticking my two broken oars into the
ground; one on one side near one end; and one on
the other side near the other end; and thus I lay
till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all
my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and
seek a proper place for my habitation, and where
to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen; where I was I yet knew not;
whether on the continent or on an island, whe-
ther inhabited or not inhabited, whether in dan-
ger of wild beasts or not: there was a hill not
above a mile from me, which rose up very steep
and high, and which seemed to over-top some
other hills which lay as in a ridge from it north-
ward; I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and
one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour
and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate to
my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island
environed every way with the sea, no land to be
seen, except some rocks which lay a great way
off, and two small islands less than this, which
lay about three leagues to the west.
• I found also that the island I was in was bar-
ren, and, as I saw good reason to believe, unin-
habited, except by wild beasts, of whom however
I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them,
F 4
could I tell what was fit for food, and what not.
At my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which
I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great
wood; I believe it was the first gun that had been
fired there since the creation of the world. I had
no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood
there arose an innumerable number of fowls of
many sorts, making a confused screaming, and
crying every one according to his usual note; but
not one of them of any kind that I knew: as for
the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had
no talons or claws more than common; its flesh
was carrion, and fit for nothing. -
Contented with this discovery, I came back to
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on
shore, which took me up the rest of that day;
and what to do with myself at night I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild
beast might devour me, though, as I afterwards
found, there was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed my-
self round with the chests and boards that I had
brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut for
that night's lodging: as for food, I yet saw not
which way to supply myself, except that I had
seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of
the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would
be useful to me, and particularly some of the rig-
ging and sails, and such other things as might
come to land, and I resolved to make another
voyage on board the vessel, if possible; and as I
knew that the first storm that blew must necessa-
rily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all
other things apart, till I got every thing out of
the ship that I could get: then I called a council,
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should
take back the raft; but this appeared imprac-
ticable; so I resolved to go as before, when the
tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped
before I went from my hut, having nothing on
but a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen trowsers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared
a second raft; and having had experience of the
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded
it so hard; but yet I brought away several things
very useful to me; as first, in the carpenter’s
stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of
hatchets, and above all, that most useful thing
called a grindstone: all these I secured, together
with several things belonging to the gunner, par-
ticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels
of musquet-bullets, seven musquets, and another
fowling-piece, with some small quantity of pow-
der more ; a large bag full of small shot, and a
great roll of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy
I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's
clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-top-sail,
hammock, and some bedding; and with this I
loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe
on shore, to my very great comfort. -
I was under some apprehensions during my ab-
sence from the land, that at least my provisions
might be devoured on shore; but when I came
back, I found no sign of any visitor, only there
sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away
a little distance, and then stood still: she sat very
composed, and unconcerned, and looked full in my
face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with
me; I presented my gun at her, but as she did
not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned
at it, nor did she offer to stir away : upon which
I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way
I was not very free of it, for my store was not
great: however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she
went to it, smelled at it, ate it, and looked, as
pleased, for more: but I thanked her, and could
spare no more; so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, (for they were too heavy, being
large casks,) I went to work to make me a little
tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for
that purpose; and into this tent I brought every
thing that I knew would spoil, either with rain
or sun, and I piled all the empty chests and casks
up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
When I had done this I blocked up the door of
the tent with some boards within, and an empty
chest set up an-end without: and spreading one
of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pis-
tols just at my head, and my gun at length by me,
I went to bed for the first time, and slept very
quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy;
for the night before I had slept little, and had
laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all
those things from the ship, as to get them on
shore. -
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now,
that ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but
I was not satisfied still ; for while the ship sat up-
right in that posture, I thought I ought to get
every thing out of her that I could: so every day
at low water I went on board, and brought away
something or other; but particularly the third
time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope
twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass,
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and
the barrel of wet gun-powder: in a word, I brought
away all the sails first and last, only that I was
fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a
time as I could ; for they were no more useful to
be sails, but as mere canvass only.
But that which comforted me more still, was,
that, last of all, after I had made five or six such
voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the ship that was worth my med-
dling with ; I say, after all this, I found a great
hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of rum
or spirits, and a box of sugar and a barrel of fine
flour: this was surprising to me, because I had
given over expecting any more provisions, except
what was spoiled by the water: I soon emptied
the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up,
parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut
out: and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore
also.
The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable
and fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and
cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could
move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the iron-work I could get; and having
cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard,
and every thing I could to make a large raft, I
loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came
away: but my good luck began now to leave me;
for this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen,
that after I had entered the little cove, where I
had landed the rest of my goods, not being able
to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset,
and threw me and all my cargo into the water.
As for myself it was no great harm, for I was near
the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part of
it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me: however,

when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces
of cable ashore; and some of the iron, though
with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it
into the water, a work which fatigued me very
much. After this, I went every day on board,
and brought away what I could get... . . -
I had been now 13 days on shore, and had been
11 times on board the ship, in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of hands could well
be supposed capable to bring ; though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but
preparing the 12th time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however at low water I
went on board, and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing
more could be found, yet I discovered a locker
with drawers in it, in one of which I found two
or three razors, and one pair of large scissars, with
some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in
another I found about thirty-six pounds value in
money, some European coin, some Brasil, some
pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money,
O Drug said I, aloud, what art thou good for?
thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the ground: one of those knives is worth all
this heap: I have no manner of use for thee, even
remain where thou art and go to the bottom, as a
creature whose life is not worth saving. How-
ever, upon second thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a piece of canvass, I began to
think of making another raft; but while I was
preparing this, I found the sky over-cast, and the
wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it
blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently oc-
curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it
was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the
shore at all: accordingly I let myself down into
the water, and swam cross the channel, which lay
between the ship and the sands, and even that
with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of
things I had about me, and partly the roughness
of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and
before it was quite high water it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where
Ilay with all my wealth about me very secure. It
blew very hard all that night; and in the morning
when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be
seen: I was a little surprised, but recovered my-
self with this satisfactory reflection, viz. That I
had lost no time, nor abated any diligence to get
every thing out of her that could be useful to me;
and that indeed there was little left in her that I
was able to bring away, if I had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship,
or of any thing out of her, except what might
drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers
pieces of her afterwards did; but those things
were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself against either savages (if any
should appear) or wild beasts, if any were in the
island; and I had many thoughts of the method
how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make ;
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or
a tent upon the earth : and, in short, I resolved
upon both, of the manner and description of
which it may not be improper to give an ac-
Count. -
I soon found the place I was in was not for my
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would
not be wholesome, and more particularly because
there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to
find a more healthy and more convenient spot of
ground.
I consulted several things in my situation which
I found would be proper for me : 1st, Health, and
fresh water, I just now mentioned. 2dly, Shelter
from the heat of the sun. 3dly, Security from
ravenous creatures, whether man or beast. 4thly,
A view to the sea; that if God sent any ship in
sight, I might not lose any advantage for my de-
liverance, of which I was not willing to banish all
my expectation yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front
towards this little plain was steep as a house-side,
so that nothing could come down upon me from
the top; on the side of this rock there was a hol-
low place, worn a little way in, like the entrance
or door of a cave; but there was not really any cave
or way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was
not above an hundred yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay like a green before my
door, and at the end of it descended irregularly
every way down into the low grounds by the sea-
side. It was on the N. N. W. side of the hill, so
that I was sheltered from the heat every day, till
it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
which in those countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle
before the hollow place, which took in about ten
yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending.
In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground about five foot and a half, and sharp-
ened on the top; the two rows did not stand above
six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows one upon an-
other, within the circle between these two rows
of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two foot
and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this
fence was so strong, that neither man or beast
could get into it or over it: this cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles
in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive
them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by
a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top;
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me;
and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as
I thought, from all the world, and consequently
slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done; though, as it appeared afterward,
there was no need of all this caution from the ene-
mies that I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour,
I carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammu-
nition and stores, of which you have the account
above; and I made me a large tent, which, to pre-
serve me from the rains, that in one part of the year
are very violent there, I made double, viz. one
smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it,
and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin
which I had saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and
everything that would spoil by the wet; and having
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance,
which till now I had left open, and so passed and
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
VOL. I. G
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock; and bringing all the earth and
stones that I dug down, out through my tent, I
laid them up within my fence in the nature of a
terrace, that so it raised the ground within about
a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave just
behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to
my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before
all these things were brought to perfection, and
therefore I must go back to some other things
which took up some of my thoughts. At the
same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme
for the setting up my tent, and making the cave,
that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud,
a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after
that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the
effect of it: I was not so much surprised with the
lightning, as I was with a thought which darted
into my mind as swift as the lightning itself: O
my powder! my very heart sunk within me, when I
thought, that at one blast all my powder might be
destroyed; on which, not my defence only, but the
providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended:
I was nothing near so anxious about my own dan-
ger; though had the powder took fire, I had never
known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that
after the storm was over, I laid aside all my works,
my building, and fortifying, and applied myself
to make bags and boxes to separate the powder,
and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in
hope, that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it
should not be possible to make one part fire an-
other. I finished this work in about a fortnight;
and I think, my powder, which in all was about
240 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a
hundred parcels: as to the barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, so
I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I
called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and
down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet
might come to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I -
went out once at least every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any
thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to ac-
quaint myself with what the island produced. The
first time I went out I presently discovered that
there were goats in the island, which was a great
satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
this misfortune to me, viz. that they were so shy,
so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most
difficult thing in the world to come at them; but
I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap-
pened; for after I had found their haunts a little,
I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed, if
they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
G 2
fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys,
and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of
me: from whence I concluded, that by the posi-
tion of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily see objects
that were above them : so afterward I took this
method: I always climbed the rocks first, to get
above them, and then had frequently a fair mark.
The first shot I made among these creatures, I
killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily;
but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still
by her till I came and took her up; and not only
so, but when I carried the old one with me upon my
shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my enclo-
sure, upon which I laid down the dam, and took the
kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in
hopes to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat,
so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself: these
two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I eat
sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread
especially) as much as possibly I could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it ab-
solutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire
in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for that, as
also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveni-
ences I made, I shall give a full account of in its
place: but I must first give some little account of
myself, and of my thoughts about living, which it
may well be supposed were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of
the course of our intended voyage, and a great
way, viz. Some hundreds of leagues out of the
ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had
great reason to consider it as a determination of
Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this de-
solate manner, I should end my life. The tears
would run plentifully down my face when I made
these reflections, and sometimes I would expostu-
late with myself, why Providence should thus com-
pletely ruin his creatures, and render them so abso-
lutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so
entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational
to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me
to check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly one day, walking with my gun in my
hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the
subject of my present condition, when reason as it
were expostulating with me the other way, thus:
Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true;
but pray remember, where are the rest of you ?
Did not you eome eleven of you into the boat?
Where are the ten ? Why were they not saved and
you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better
to be here or there? and then I pointed to the
sea. All evils are to be considered with the good
that is in them, and with what worse attended
them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
G 3
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have
been my case if it had not happened, which was
an hundred thousand to one, that the ship floated
from the place where she first struck, and was
driven so near the shore that I had time to get all
these things out of her : what would have been my
case if I had been to have lived in the condition in
which I at first came on shore, without necessaries
of life or necessaries to supply and procure them 2
Particularly, said I aloud, (though to myself) what
should I have done without a gun, without ammu-
nition, without any tools to make any thing, or to
work with ; without clothes, bedding, a tent, or
any manner of covering: and that now I had all
these to a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way
to provide myselfin such a manner, as to live with-
out my gun when my ammunition was spent; so
that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without .
any want, as long as I lived; for I considered from
the beginning how I should provide for the acci-
dents that might happen and for the time that was
to come, even not only after my ammunition should
be spent, but even after my health or strength
should decay.
I confess I had not entertained any notion of
my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I
mean my powder being blown up by lightning;
and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to
me when it lightened and thundered, as I observed
just now.
And now being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as
was never heard of in the world before, I shall take
it from its beginning, and continue it in its order.
It was, by my account, the 30th of September,
when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot
upon this horrid island, when the sun being, to us,
in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my
head; for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be
in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of
the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days,
it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from
the working days; but to prevent this, I cut it
with my knife upon a large post in capital letters,
and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the
shore where I first landed, viz. I came on shore
here on the 30th of Sept. 1659. Upon the sides
of this square post, I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch was as long
again as the rest, and every first day of the month
as long again as that long one; and thus I kept my
calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning
of time. -
In the next place we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought out of the ship
in the several voyages, which, as above mentioned,
I made to it, I got several things of less value,
but not all less useful to me, which I omitted set-
ting down before ; as in particular, pens, ink, and
G 4
paper; several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gun-
ner's, and carpenter's keeping; three or four com-
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials, per-
spectives, charts, and books of navigation; all
which I huddled together, whether I might want
them or no: also, I found three very good bibles
which came to me in my cargo from England, and
which I had packed up among my things; some
Portuguese books also, and among them two or
three popish prayer-books, and several other books,
all which I carefully secured. And I must not
forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats
of whose eminent history I may have occasion to
say something in its place; for I carried both the
cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out
of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and was a trusty servant to me many years; I
wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any
company that he could make up to me; I only
wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could
not do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink,
and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost;
and I shall shew, that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very exact; but after that was gone, I could
not; for I could not make any ink, by any means
that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to-
gether; and of these this of ink was one, as also
spade, pick-axe and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I
soon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habi-
tation: the piles or stakes, which were as heavy
as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting
and preparing in the woods, and more by far in
bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days
in cutting and bringing home one of those posts,
and a third day in driving it into the ground; for
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first,
but at last bethought myself of one of the iron
crows, which however, though I found it, yet it
made driving those posts or piles very laborious and
tedious work. -
But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other em-
ployment if that had been over, at least, that I could
foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for
food, which I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I
drew up the state of my affairs in writing; not so
much to leave them to any that were to come
after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as
to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason
began now to master my despondency, I began to
comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the
90
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
good against the evil, that I might have some-
thing to distinguish my case from worse; and
I stated it very impartially, like debtor and credi-
tor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I
suffered, thus:
EVIL.
I am cast upon a horri-
ble desolate island, void of
all hope of recovery.
I am singled out and se-
parated, as it were, from
all the world, to be mi-

kind, a solitaire, one ba-
nished from human so-
ciety.

I am without any de-

But I am alive, and
not drowned, as all my
ship's company was.
But I am singled out
too from all the ship’s
crew to be spared from
death; and He that mira-
culously saved me from
death, can deliver me from
this condition.
But I am not starved
and perishing on a barren
place, affording no suste-

But I am in a hot cli-
mate where if I had

But I am cast on an

I have no soul to peak But God wonderfully
to, or relieve me. sent the ship in near
enough to the shore, that
I have gotten out so many
necessary things as will
either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply
myself even as long as I
live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testi-
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the
world so miserable, but there was something nega-
tive or something positive to be thankful for in it;
and let this stand as a direction from the expe-
rience of the most miserable of all conditions in
this world, that we may always find in it something
to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the de-
scription of good and evil, on the credit side of the
aCCOunt. -
Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, and given over looking out to sea, to
see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these
things, I began to apply myself to accommodate
my way of living, and to make things as easy to me
as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded
with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I might
now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall
up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside, and after some time, I think it was a year
and a half, I raised rafters from it, leaning to the
rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of
trees, and such things as I could get to keep out
the rain, which I found at some times of the year
very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had
made behind me: but I must observe too that at
first this was a confused heap of goods, which as
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place, I
had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to en-
large my cave and works farther into the earth;
for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily
to the labour I bestowed on it: and so when I found
I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked
sideways to the right hand into the rock; and then,
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
made me a door to come out, on the outside of my
pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it
were a back-way to my tent and to my store-house,
but gave me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, parti-
cularly a chair and a table; for without these I was
-->

not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the
world; I could not write or eat, or do several things
with so much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work ; and here I must needs ob-
serve, that as reason is the substance and original
of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring
everything by reason, and by making the most
rational judgment of things, every man may be in
time master of every mechanic art. I had never
handled a tool in my life, and yet in time by labour,
application, and contrivance, I found at last that I
wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially
if I had had tools; however I made abundance of
things, even without tools, and some with no more
tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps
were never made that way before, and that with
infinite labour; for example, if I wanted a board,
I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it
on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side
with my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as
a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It
is true, by this method I could make but one board
out of a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for
but patience, any more than I had for the prodi-
gious deal of time and labour which it took me up
to make a plank or board: but my time or labour
was little worth, and so it was as well employed one
way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I
observed above, in the first place, and this I did
out of the short pieces of boards which I brought
on my raft from the ship: but when I had wrought
out some boards, as above, I made large shelves,
of the breadth of a foot and a half one over another,
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron-work, and in a word, to separate
every thing at large in their places, that I might
come easily at them; I knocked pieces into the
wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things
that would hang up.
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things;
and I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it
was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in
such order, and especially to find my stock of all ne-
cessaries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep a journal
of every day's employment; for indeed at first I
was in too much a hurry; and not only hurry as
to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind,
and my journal would have been full of many dull
things. For example, I must have said thus:
Sept. the 30th, after I got to shore, and had
escaped drowning, instead of being thankful to
God for my deliverance, having first vomited with
the great quantity of salt water which was gotten
into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I
ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and beat-
ing my head and face, exclaiming at my misery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone; till, tired
and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground
to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being de-
voured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on
board the ship, and got all that I could out of her,
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a
little mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes
of seeing a ship; then fancy at a vast distance I
spied a sail; please myself with the hopes of it;
and then, after looking steadily till I was almost
blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a
child, and thus increase my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things in some
measure, and having settled my household-stuff and
habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my
journal, of which I shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particulars over
again) as long as it lasted; for having no more ink,
I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
SEPT. 30, 1659. *
I Poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing,
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island,
which I called the Island of Despair, all the rest
of the ship's company being drowned, and myself
almost dead. -
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting my-
self, at the dismal circumstances I was brought to,
viz. I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or
place to fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw
nothing but death before me, either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages,
or starved to death for want of food. At the ap-
proach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild
creatures, but slept soundly though it rained all
night.
October 1. In the morning I saw to my great
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide,
and was driven on shore again much nearer the
island, which as it was some comfort on one hand,
for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces,
I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board,
and get some food or necessaries out of her for my
relief; so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief
at the loss of my comrades, who I imagined if we
had all staid on board might have saved the ship, or
at least that they would not have been all drowned,
as they were ; and that, had the men been saved,
we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the
ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other
part of the world. I spent great part of this day
in perplexing myself on these things; but at
length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the
sand as near as I could, and then swam on board;
this day also it continued raining, though with no
wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in making several voyages to
get all I could out of the ship, which I brought
on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I
had got up upon it: but being in shoal water, and
the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of
them when the tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of wind, during which time the ship
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen, except
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent
this day in covering and securing the goods which
I had saved, that rain might not spoil them.
Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day,
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con-
cerned to secure myself from any attack in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semi-circle for my encampment,
which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall,
or fortification made of double piles, lined within
with cable, and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis-
cover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and
her kid followed me home; which I afterwards
killed also, because it would not feed. -
VOL. I. H
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock,
and lay there for the first night, making it as large
as I could with stakes driven in to swing my ham-
mock upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with
them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In
the afternoon went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of
sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if
it did not rain, then employed myself to work till
about eleven o’clock, then eat what I had to live on,
and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the
weather being excessive hot, and then in the even-
ing to work again: the working part of this day, and
of the next, were wholly employed in making my
table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman,
though time and necessity made me a complete na-
tural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do
any one else.
Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft,
but her flesh good for nothing: every creature I
killed I took off the skins and preserved them.
Coming back by the sea-shore I saw many sorts of
sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was
surprised and almost frighted with two or three
seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well know-
ing what they were, got into the sea, and escaped
me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to
my liking: nor was it long before I learned to
mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for
the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up to make me
a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable
shape, but never to please me; and even in the
making I pulled it in pieces several times. Note,
I soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for omitting
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was
which.
Nov. 18. This day it rained, which refreshed
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was
accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my pow-
der: as soon as it was over I resolved to separate
my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger. -
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making little square chests or boxes, which might
hold about a pound, or two pounds, at most, of
powder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it
in places as secure and remote from one another as
possible. On one of these three days I killed a
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.
H 2
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my
tent into the rock, to make room for my farther
conveniency. Note, three things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel,
and a wheel-barrow or basket, so I desisted from
my work, and began to consider how to supply
that want, and make me some tools: as for a
pick-axe, I made use of the iron crows, which
were proper enough, though heavy; but the next
thing was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely
necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effec-
tually without it; but what kind of one to make I
knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods
I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in
the Brasils they call the Iron Tree, for its exceeding
hardness; of this, with great labour and almost spoil-
ing my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home
too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for I worked it effectually by little and little
into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle ex-
actly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long; however it served
well enough for the uses which I had occasion to
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made
after that fashion, or so long a making.
:: I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a
wheel-barrow : a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of,
neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for
the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave
it over; and so for carrying away the earth which I
dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they
serve the bricklayers. -
This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the at-
tempt which I made in vain to make a wheel-barrow,
took me up no less than four days, I mean always
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I
seldom failed; and very seldom failed also bringing
home something to eat. • *
Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously.
Note, During all this time, I worked to make
this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate
me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a diming-
room, and a cellar; as for my lodging, I kept to
the tent, except that sometimes in the wet season
of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep
H 3
myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover
all my place within my pale with long poles in the
form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load
them with flags and large leaves of trees like a
thatch. -
December 10. I began now to think my cave
or vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell
down from the top and one side, so much that in
short it frighted me, and not without reason too;
for if I had been under it I had never wanted a
grave-digger: upon this disaster I had a great deal
of work to do over again; for I had the loose earth
to carry out, and, which was of more importance,
I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be
sure no more would come down.
Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two shores or posts pitched up-
right to the top, with two pieces of boards across
over each post; this I finished the next day; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, stand-
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part off
my house.
Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I
placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts
to hang every thing up that could be hung up ;
and now I began to be in some order within doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the
cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up
some pieces of boards, like a dresser. to order my
victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce
with me: also I made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no
stirring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all day.
Dec. 26. No rain? and the earth much cooler
than before, and pleasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed an-
other, so that I caught it, and led it home in a
string; when I had it home, I bound and splin-
tered up its leg, which was broke. N. B. I took
such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well
and as strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my
door, and would not go away : this was the first
time that I entertained a thought of breeding up
some tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
evening for food: this time I spent in putting all
my things in order within doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening, going farther
into the valleys, which lay towards the centre of
the island, I found there was plenty of goats,
though exceeding shy and hard to come at; how-
ever I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog
to hunt them down. -
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out
H 4
with my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the
dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he
would not come near them.
Jan. 8. I began my fence or wall; which, being
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I
resolved to make very thick and strong.
N. B. This wall being described before, I
purposely omit what was said in the Jour-
nal ; it is sufficient to observe, that I was
no less time than from the 3d of January
to the 14th of April, working, finishing,
and perfecting this wall, though it was
no more than about 24 yards in length,
being a half circle from one place in the
rock to another place about eight yards
from it, the door of the cave being in
the centre behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks toge-
ther; but I thought I should never be perfectly
secure until this wall was finished; and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour every thing was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground, for I
made them much bigger than I need to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside
double fenced with a turf-wall raised up close to
it, I persuaded myself that if any people were to
come on shore there, they would not perceive any
thing like a habitation; and it was very well I did
so, as may be observed hereafter upon a very re-
markable occasion.
During this time I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me,
and made frequent discoveries in these walks of
something or other to my advantage; particularly
I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and
did so; but when they grew older they flew away.
which perhaps was at first for want of feeding
them, for I had nothing to give them; however I
frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat. -
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first it was impossible for me to make,
as indeed, as to some of them, it was; for instance,
I could never make a cask to be hooped: I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I
could never arrive to the capacity of making one
by them, though I spent many weeks about it; I
could neither put in the heads, or joint the staves
so true to one another as to make them hold water;
so I gave that also over. -
In the next place, I was at a great loss for
candle; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which
was generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to
-
go to bed: I remembered the lump of bees-wax
with which I made candles in my African adven-
ture, but I had none of that now; the only remedy
I had, was, that when I had killed a goat I saved
the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay,
which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick
of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave
me light, though not a clear steady light like a
candle. In the middle of all my labours it hap-
pened, that rummaging my things, I found a little
bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled with
corn for the feeding of poultry—not for this voy-
age, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came
from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had
been in the bag, was all devoured with the rats,
and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust;
and being willing to have the bag for some other
use, I think it was to put powder in, when I di-
vided it for fear of the lightning, or some such
use, I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side
of my fortification under the rock.
It was a little before the great rains, just now
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no
notice of any thing, and not so much as remem-
bering that I had thrown any thing there; when
about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some
few stalks of something green shooting out of the
ground, which I fancied might be some plant I
had not seen; but I was surprised and perfectly
astonished, when after a little longer time I saw
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect green barley of the same kind as our Euro-
pean, nay, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any sense of any thing
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance,
or, as we lightly say, what pleases GoD ; without
so much as inquiring into the end of Providence
in these things, or his order in governing events
in the world; but after I saw barley grow there,
in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially that I knew not how it came there,
it startled me strangely; and I began to suggest,
that God had miraculously caused this grain to
grow without any help of seed sown, and that it
was so directed purely for my sustenance on that
wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought
tears out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself,
that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon
my account; and this was the more strange to me,
because I saw near it still, all along by the side of
the rock, some other straggling stalks, which
proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, be-
cause I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was
ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions
of Providence for my support, but not doubting
but that there was more in the place, I went all
over that part of the island, where I had been be-
fore, peeping in every corner and under every rock
to see for more of it, but I could not find any; at
last it occurred to my thought, that I had shook
a bag of chickens meat out in that place, and then
the wonder began to cease; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to GoD's providence
began to abate too, upon discovering that all this
was nothing but what was common; though I
ought to have been as thankful for so strange and
unforeseen a providence as if it had been miracu-
lous; for it was really the work of Providence as
to me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve
grains of corn to remain unspoiled, when the rats
had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped
from heaven: as also, that I should throw it out
in that particular place, where, it being in the
shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas if I had thrown it any where else at that
time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be
sure, in their season, which was about the end of
June, and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow
them all again, hoping in time to have some quan-
tity sufficient to supply me with bread; but it was
not till the fourth year that I could allow myself
the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then
but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order;
for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not
observing the proper time; for I sowed it just be-
fore the dry season, so that it never came up at all,
at least not as it would have done: of which in
its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind or
to the same purpose, viz. To make me bread, or
rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with-
out baking, though I did that also after some time.
But to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four
months to get my wall done; and the 14th of
April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not
by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there
might be no sign in the outide of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder, so I went up
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up
after me, and let it down on the inside : this was
a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unless it could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished,
I had almost had all my labour overthrown at once,
and myself killed; the case was thus: As I was
busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in
the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted
with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for
on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling
down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge
of the hill, over my head, and two of the posts I
had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful man-
ner: I was heartily scared, but thought nothing
of what was really the cause, only thinking that
the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had
done before; and for fear I should be buried in it,
I ran forward to my ladder; and not thinking my-
self safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear
of the pieces of the hill which I expected might
roll down upon me: I was no sooner stepped down
upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a
terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood on
shook three times at about eight minutes distance,
with three such shocks as would have overturned
the strongest building that could be supposed to
have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the
top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from
me next the sea, fell down with such a terrible
noise as I never heard in all my life: I perceived
also the very sea was put into violent motion by
it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having
never felt the like, or discoursed with any one that
had, that I was like one dead or stupified; and
the motion of the earth made my stomach sick,
like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and
rousing me from the stupified condition I was in,
filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing
then but the hill falling upon my tent, and all my
household goods, and burying all at once; and this
sunk my very soul within me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no
more for some time, I began to take courage, and
yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall
again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still
upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconso.
late, not knowing what to do: all this while I had
not the least serious religious thought, nothing
but the common, Lord have mercy upon me; and
when it was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that
the wind rose by little and little, so that in less
than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurri.
cane : the sea was all on a sudden covered over
with foam and froth, the shore was covered with
the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by
the roots, and a terrible storm it was ; and this
held about three hours, and then began to abate,
and in two hours more it was stark calm, and began
to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture
into my cave again: with this thought my spirits
began to revive, and the rain also helping to per-
suade me, I went in and sat down in my tent, but
the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to
be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go
into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy,
for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz.
to cut a hole through my new fortification like a
sink to let water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave
some time, and found still no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed;
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed
wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small sup of rum, which however I did
then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great
part of the next day, so that I could not stir
abroad; but my mind being more composed, I
began to think of what I had best do, concluding,
that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but I
must consider of building me some little hut in an
open place, which I might surround with a wall
as I had done here, and so make myself secure
from wild beasts or men: but concluded, if I staid
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other,
be buried alive.
With these thoughts I resolved to remove my
tent from the place where it stood, which was just
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which,
if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall
upon my tent: and I spent the two next days,
being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving
where and how to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehen-
sion of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost
equal to it; but still, when I looked about and saw
how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it
made me very loth to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me that it
would require a vast deal of time for me to do this,
and that I must be contented to run the venture
where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself,
and had secured it to as to remove so it; so with
this resolution I composed myself for a time, and
resolved that I would go to work with all speed to
build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a
circle as before ; and set my tent up in it when it
was finished, but that I would venture to stay
where I was till it was finished and fit to remove to.
This was the 21st.
April 22. The next morning I began to consi-
der of means to put this resolve in execution, but
I was at a great loss about my tools; I had three
large axes and abundance of hatchets (for we
carried the hatchets for traffick with the Indians),
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
wood, they were all full of notches and dull, and
though I had a grind-stone, I could not turn it and
grind my tools too: this cost me as much thought
as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand
VOL. I. I
point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death
of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a
string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have
both my hands at liberty. Note, I had never seen
any such thing in England, or at least not to take
notice how it was done, though since I have ob-
served it is very common there; besides that, my
grind-stone was very large and heavy. This machine
cost me a full week’s work to bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up
in grinding my tools, my machine for turning my
grind-stone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and
reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which
made my heart very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the
sea-side, the tide being low, I saw something lie
on the shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked
like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small
barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of
the ship, which were driven on shore by the late
hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself,
I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water
than it used to do: I examined the barrel which
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a
barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken water, and
the powder was caked as hard as a stone; however
I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and
went on upon the sands as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it
strangely removed : the fore-castle, which lay be-
fore buried in sand, was heaved up at least six
foot; and the stern, which was broke to pieces
and parted from the rest by the force of the sea,
soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed,
as it were, up, and cast on one side, and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that
whereas there was a great place of water before,
so that I could not come within a quarter of a
mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now
walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was
surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it
must be done by the earthquake: and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than for-
merly, so many things came daily on shore, which
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and
water rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the de-
sign of removing my habitation; and I busied my-
self mightily that day especially, in searching
whether I could make any way into the ship; but
I found nothing was to be expected of that kind,
for that all the inside of the ship was choked up
with sand; however, as I had learnt not to despair
of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to
pieces that I could of the ship, concluding, that
every thing I could get from her would be of some
use or other to me. -
May 8. I began with my saw, and cut a piece
of a beam through, which I thought held some
I 2
of the upper part or quarter deck together; and
when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand
as well as I could from the side which lay highest;
but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over
for that time. -
May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one
fish that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my
sport; when just going to leave off, I caught a
young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some
rope yarn, but I had no hooks, yet I frequently
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all
which I dried in the sun, and eat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another
beam asunder, and brought three great fir planks
off from the decks, which I tied together, and
made swim on shore when the tide of flood came
OII, -
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work;
worked very hard, and came home very much
tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. -
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work, but found the weight of the
wreck had broke itself down, the beams being
cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie
loose: and the inside of the hold lay so open, that
I could see into it, but almost full of water and
sand. -
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of the water or sand; I wrenched open two
planks, and brought them on shore also with the
tide : I left the iron crow in the wreck for next
day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt se-
veral casks, and loosened them with the crow, but
could not break them up ; I felt also the roll of
English lead, and could stir it, but it was too
heavy to remove. -
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber,
and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred
weight of iron. -
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I
could not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing
the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the
other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the
water, I could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet. : -
May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of
the water; but I staid so long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going
to the wreck that day.
* May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown
on shore, at a great distance, near two miles off
me, but resolved to see what they were, and found
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to
bring away. -
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on
the wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some
I 3
things so much with the crow, that the first blow-
ing tide several casks floated out, and two of the
seamen’s chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of
timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork
in it, but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of
June, except the time necessary to get food, which
I always appointed, during this part of my employ-
ment, to be when the tide was up, that I might
be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time
I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known
how ; and also, I got at several times, and in seve-
ral pieces, near 100 weight of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea side, I found
a large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had
seen, which it seems was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day; as I found after-
wards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle; I found
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever
I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of
goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.
June 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in
that latitude.
- -*
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea-
ther had been cold. -
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my
head, and feverish. - - -
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death
with the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be
sick and no help : Prayed to God for the first
time since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what
I said, or why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness. -
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering,
and then a violent head-ach. - - -
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after
it. -
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; how-
ever I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty
got it home, and broiled some of it, and eat ; I
would fain have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay
a-bed all day, and neither eat or drank. I was
ready to perish for thirst, but so weak I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water
to drink: prayed to God again, but was light-
headed ; and when I was not, I was so ignorant
that I knew not what to say; only Ilay and cried,
Lord look upon me; Lord pity me; Lord have
I 4
mercy upon me: I suppose I did nothing else for
two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell
asleep, and did not wake till far in the night; when
I waked I found myself much refreshed, but weak
and exceeding thirsty : however, as I had no water
in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till
morning, and went to sleep again. In this second
sleep I had this terrible dream.
. I thought that I was sitting on the ground on
the outside of my wall, where I sat when the
storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a
man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright
flame of fire, and alight upon the ground. He was
all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but
just bear to look towards him; his countenance
was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for
words to describe; when he stepped upon the
ground with his feet I thought the earth trembled
just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all
the air looked to my apprehension as if it had been
filled with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to
me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impos-
sible to express the terror of it; all that I can say I
understood was this, Seeing all these things have
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt
die;’ at which words I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand to kill me.
No one, that shall ever read this account, will
expect that I should be able to describe the horrors
of my soul at this terrible vision ; I mean, that
even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of
those horrors; nor is it any more possible to de-
scribe the impression that remained upon my mind,
when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had
received by the good instruction of my father was
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight
years, of sea-faring wickedness, and a constant
conversation with nothing but such as were like
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree:
I do not remember that I had in all that time one
thought that so much as tended either to looking
upwards towards GoD, or inwards towards a reflec-
tion upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity
of soul, without desire of good, or conscious of
evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and I was
all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked
creature among our common sailors can be sup-
posed to be, not having the least sense, either of
the fear of GoD in danger, or of thankfulness to
GoD in deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I shall
add, that through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much
as one thought of it being the hand of GoD, or
that it was a just punishment for my sin, my re-
bellious behaviour against my father, or my present
sins, which were great; or so much as a punish-
ment for the general course of my wicked life.
When I was on the desperate expedition on the
desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as
one thought of what would become of me; or one
wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or
to keep me from the danger which apparently sur-
rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as
cruel savages: but I was merely thoughtless of a
GoD, or a Providence ; acted like a mere brute from
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of
common sense only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by
the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly
and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had
not the least thankfulness on my thoughts: when
again I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of
drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse,
or looking on it as a judgment; I only said to my-
self often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born
to be always miserable. -
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and
found all my ship's crew drowned, and myself
spared, I was surprised with a kind of ectasy, and
some transports of soul, which, had the grace of
GoD assisted, might have come up to true thank-
fulness; but it ended where it begun, in a mere
common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad
I was alive, without the least reflection upon the
distinguishing goodness of the hand which had
preserved me, and had singled me out to be pre-
served, when all the rest were destroyed; or an
inquiry why providence had been thus merciful to
me; even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they have got safe
on shore from a shipwreck, which they drown all
in the nextbowl of punch, and forget, almost assoon
as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due considera-
tion, made sensible of my condition; how I was
cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of
human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect
of redemption; as soon as I saw but a prospect of
living, and that I should not starve and perish for
hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, and
I began to be very easy, applied myself to the
works proper for my preservation and supply, and
was far enough from being afflicted at my condi-
tion, as a judgment from heaven, or as the hand of
God against me: these were thoughts which very
seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
journal, had at first some little influence upon me,
and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as
I thought it had something miraculous in it; but
as soon as ever that part of thought was removed,
all the impression which was raised from it wore
off also, as I have noted already. -
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately
directing to the invisible power, which alone directs
such things; yet no sooner was the first fright
over, but the impression it had made went off also ;
I had no more sense of GoD, or his judgments,
much less of the present affliction of my circum-
stances being from his hand, than if I had been in
the most prosperous condition of life. ,
But now, when I began to be sick, and a
leisurely view of the miseries of death came to
place itself before me; when my spirits began to
sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and
nature was exhausted with the violence of the
fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began
to awake, and I began to reproach myself with
my past life, in which I had so evidently, by un-
common wickedness, provoked the justice of GoD
to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal
with me in so vindictive a manner.
- These reflections oppressed me from the second
or third day of my distemper, and in the violence,
as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches
of my conscience, extorted some words from me,
like praying to God, though I cannot say they
were either a prayer attended with desires, or with
hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and
distress: my thoughts were confused, the convic-
tions great upon my mind, and the horror. of dying
in such a miserable condition, raised vapours into
my head with the mere apprehensions; and, in
these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my
tongue might express. But it was rather exclama-
tion; such as, Lord! what a miserable creature am
I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for
want of help, and what will become of me? Then
the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say
no more for a good while.
In this interval the good advice of my father
came to my mind, and presently his prediction,
which I mentioned in the beginning of this story;
viz. That if I did take this foolish step, GoD would
not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter
to reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when
there might be none to assist in my recovery.
Now, said I aloud, my dear father's words are
come to pass: God's justice has overtaken me, and
I have none to help or hear me; I rejected the
voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me
in a posture or station of life wherein I might have
been happy and easy; but I would neither see it
myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it from,
my parents; I left them to mourn over my folly,
and now I am left to mourn under the conse-
quences of it: I refused their help and assistance,
who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me; and
now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great
for even nature itself to support, and no assistance,
no help, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried out,
Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress!
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I return to my
journal. - -
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off,
I got up: and though the fright and terror of my
dream was very great, yet I considered, that the
fit of the ague would return again the next day,
and now was my time to get something to refresh
and support myself when I should be ill; and the
first thing I did, I filled a large square case bottle
with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of
my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish disposi-
tion of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together: then I
got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it
on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked
about, but was very weak, and, withal, very sad
and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable
condition, dreading the return of my distemper the
next day: at night I made my supper of three of
the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and
eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was the first
bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to,
even, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found
myself so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun
(for I never went out without that); so I went but
a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking
out upon the sea, which was just before me, and
very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such
thoughts as these occurred to me:—
What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen
so much P Whence is it produced? And what am I,
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal; whence are we ?
of Robinson CRUsoe. 127
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
is that?
Then it followed, most naturally: it is GoD that
has made it all. Well, but then it came on strangely;
if GoD has made all these things, he guides and
governs them all, and all things that concern them;
for the Being that could make all things, must cer-
tainly have power to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit
of his works, either without his knowledge or ap-
pointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge,
he knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful con-
dition; and if nothing happens without his appoint-
ment, he has appointed all this to befal me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs
be, that GoD had appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miserable circumstance
by his direction, he having the sole power, not of
me only, but of every thing that happened in the
world. Immediately it followed, -
Why has GoD done this to me? What have I
done to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that
inquiry, as if I had blasphemed ; and methought it
spoke to me, like a voice; Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
mispent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar-
mouth Roads 2 killed in the fight when the ship
was taken by the Sallee man of war 2 devoured by
the wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned
HERE, when all the crew perished but thyself?
Dost thou ask, What have I done P
I was struck with these reflections as one asto-
nished, and had not a word to say, no, not to an-
swer to myself; but rose up pensive and sad,
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts
were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the ap-
prehensions of the return of my distemper terrified
me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the
Brasilians take no physic but their tobacco, for
almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of
tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured,
and some also that was green, and not quite cured.
128 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
this chest I found a cure both for soul and body
I opened the chest, and found what I looked for,
viz. the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved
lay there too, I took out one of the bibles which
I mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had
not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look
into ; I say I took it out, and brought both that
and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as
to my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no;
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I re-
solved it should hit one way or other: I first took
a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which
indeed at first almost stupified my brain, the tobacco
being green and strong, and that I had not been
much used to it; then I took some, and steeped it
an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a
dose of it when I lay down ; and lastly, I burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as
well for the heat as the virtue of it, and I held al-
most to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the
bible, and began to read; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading,
at least at that time; only having opened the book
casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these, “Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.”
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did
afterwards; for, as for being delivered, the word
had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was
so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of
things, that I began to say as the children of Israel
did when they were promised flesh to eat, “Can
GoD spread a table in the wilderness?” so I began
to say, Can God himself deliver me from this
place ? And as it was not for many years that any
hope appeared, this prevailed very often upon my
thoughts; but, however, the words made a very
VOL. I. K
great impression upon me, and I mused upon them
very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco
had, as I said, dozed my head so much, that I in-
clined to sleep; so that I left my lamp burning in
the cave, lest I should want any thing in the night,
and went to bed : but before I lay down, I did
what I never had done in all my life; I kneeled
down and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to
me, that if I called upon him in the day of trouble,
he would deliver me. After my broken and im-
perfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce
get it down. Immediately upon this I went to
bed, and I found presently it flew up into my head
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked
no more, till by the sun it must necessarily be near
three o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nay,
to this hour I am partly of the opinion, that I
slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise I knew not how
I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days
of the week, as it appeared some years after I had
done; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing
the line, I should have lost more than a day: but in
my account it was lost, and I never knew which
way.
Be that however one way or other, when I
awaked, I found myself exceedingly refreshed,
and my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got
up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and
my stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in
short, I had no fit the next day, but conti-
nued much altered for the better. This was the
29th.
The 30th was my well day, of course; and I
went abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel
too far: I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like
a brand goose, and brought them home, but was
not very forward to eat them: so I eat some more
of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This
evening Irenewed the medicine which I had sup-
posed did me good the day before, viz. the tobacco
steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as
before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke : however, I was not so well
the next day, which was the first of July, as I hoped
I should have been ; for I had a little spice of the
cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it at first, and doubled
the quantity which I drank.
July 8. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts run exceedingly upon this scripture, “I
will deliver thee;” and the impossibility of my de-
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my
ever expecting it: but as I was discouraging my-
self with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind,
that I pored so much upon my deliverance from
the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliver-
K 2
ance I had received; and I was, as it were, made
to ask myself such questions as these ; viz. Have
I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from
sickness? from the most distressed condition that
could be, and that was so frightful to me? and what
notice had I taken of it? had I done my part? God
had delivered me: but I had not glorified him :
that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful
for that as a deliverance; and how could I expect
greater deliverance 2
- This touched my heart very much, and immedi-
ately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud,
for my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the bible; and,
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile
every morning and every night, not tying myself
to the number of chapters, but as long as my
thoughts should engage me: it was not long after
I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart
more deeply and sincerely affected with the wick-
edness of my past life; the impression of my dream
revived, and the words, All these things have not
brought thee to repentance, ran seriously in my
thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give
me repentance, when it happened providentially
the very day, that, reading the scripture, I came
to these words, “He is exalted a Prince and a
Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remission.”
I threw down the book, and with my heart as well
as my hand lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstacy
of joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus, thou Son of David,
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me
repentance
This was the first time that I could say, in the
true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life;
for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and
with a true scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the word of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, “Call on me, and I will deliver thee,” in a
different sense from what I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the
captivity I was in ; for though I was indeed at
large in the place, yet the island was certainly a
prison to me, and that, in the worst sense in the
world; but now I learned to take it in another
sense. Now I looked back upon my past life with
such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that
my soul sought nothing of God, but deliverance
from the load of guilt that bore down all my com-
fort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did
not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or
think of it; it was all of no consideration, in com-
parison of this: and I added this part here, to hint
to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come
to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance
from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance
from affliction.
K 3
But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier
to my mind; and my thoughts being directed by a
constant reading the Scripture, and praying to
God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which till now I knew no-
thing of: also as my health and strength returned,
I bestirred myself to furnish myself with every
thing that I wanted, and make my way of living as
regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sick-
mess; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was,
and to what weakness I was reduced. The appli-
cation which I made use of was perfectly new, and
perhaps what had never cured an ague before ;
neither can I recommend it to any one to practise
by this experiment; and though it did carry off
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me; for
I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs
for some time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in
those rains which came attended with storms and
hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came
in a dry season was always most accompanied with
such storms, so I found this rain was much more
dangerous than the rain which fell in September
and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above
ten months; all possibility of deliverance from
this condition seemed to be entirely taken from
me; and I firmly believed that no human shape
had ever set foot upon that place. Having now
secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my
mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect
discovery of the island, and to see what other pro-
ductions I might find, which yet I knew nothing
of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island itself; I went
up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought
my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher,
and that it was no more than a little brook of run-
ning water, and very fresh and good; but this being
the dry season, there was hardly any water in some
parts of it, at least not enough to run into any
stream, so as it could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many plea-
sant savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and co-
vered with grass; and on the rising parts of them
next to the higher grounds, where the water, as it
Inight be supposed, never overflowed, I found a
great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a
great and very strong stalk: there were divers
other plants which I had no notion of, or under-
K 4
standing about ; and might perhaps have virtues
of their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassave root, which the In-
dians in all that climate make their bread of, but
I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but
did not then understand them: I saw several sugar
canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented myself with these discove-
ries for this time, and came back musing with
myself what course I might take to know the vir-
tue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants
which I should discover, but could bring it to no
conclusion: for, in short, I had made so little ob-
servation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew
little of the plants of the field, at least very little
that might serve me to any purpose now in my
distress.
* . The next day, the 16th, I went up the same
way again; and, after going something farther
than I had done the day before, I found the brook
and the savannas began to cease, and the country
became more woody than before. In this part I
found different fruits, and particularly I found
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread indeed
over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just
now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was
a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad
of them, but I was warned by my experience to
eat sparingly of them, remembering that, when I
was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen who were slaves there,
by throwing them into fluxes and fevers: but I
found an excellent use for these grapes, and that
was to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them
as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought
would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome,
and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might be
had. -
I spent all that evening there, and went not
back to my habitation, which by the way was the
first night, as I might say, I had lain from home.
In the night I took my first contrivance, and got
up into a tree, where I slept well, and the next
morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling
near four miles, as I might judge by the length of
the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of
hills on the south and north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way,
that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being
in a constant verdure or flourishing of spring, that
it looked like a planted garden. -
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was king
and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had
a right of possession; and if I could convey it, I
might have it in inheritance, as completely as any
lord of a manor in England. I saw here abun-
dance of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon, and ci-
tron-trees, but all wild, and few bearing any
fruit; at least, not then : however, the green limes
that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but
very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards
with water, which made it very wholesome, and
very cool and refreshing.
I found now I had business enough to gather
and carry home; and resolved to lay up a store,
as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish
myself for the wet season, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In order to do this I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a few of each with me,
I travelled homeward, and resolved to come again,
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,
to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this
journey, I came home (so I must now call my
tent, and my cave); but before I got thither, the
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and
the weight of the juice, having broken them, and
bruised them, they were good for little or nothing:
as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring
but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back,
having made me two small bags to bring home
my harvest. But I was surprised, when coming to
my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine
when I gathered them, I found them all spread
abroad, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some
here, some there, and abundance eaten and de-
voured. By this I concluded there were some wild
creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them
up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack,
but that one way they would be destroyed, and
the other way they would be crushed with their
own weight, I took another course; for I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them
upon the out branches of the trees, that they might
cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I con-
templated with great pleasure on the fruitfulness
of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situa-
tion, the security from storms on that side of the
water, and the wood; and concluded that I had
pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was
by far the worst part of the country. Upon the
whole, I began to consider of removing my habi-
tation, and to look out for a place equally safe as
where I now was situated, if possible, in that plea-
sant fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was
exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasant-
mess of the place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I was
now by the sea side, where it was at least possible
that something might happen to my advantage,
and that the same ill fate that brought me hither,
might bring some other unhappy wretches to the
same place; and though it was scarce probable
that any such thing should ever happen, yet to en-
close myself among the hills and woods, in the
centre of the island, was to anticipate my bondage,
and to render such an affair not only improbable,
but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by
any means to remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there for the whole
remaining part of the month of July; and though,
upon second thoughts I resolved as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower,
and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach,
well staked and filled between with brushwood;
and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights together, always going over it with a lad-
der, as before ; so that I fancied now I had my
country house, and my sea-coast house: and this
work took me up the beginning of August.
: I had but newly finished my fence, and began
to enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and
made me stick close to my first habitation; for
though I had made me a tent like the other, with
a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had
not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,
nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the
rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself.
The third of August I found the grapes I had
hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were
excellent good raisins of the sun : so I began to
take them down from the trees, and it was very
happy that I did so; for the rains which followed
would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best
part of my winter food; for I had above two hun.
dred large bunches of them. No sooner had I
taken them all down, and carried most of them
home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from
thence, which was the fourteenth of August, it
rained more or less every day, till the middle of
October; and sometimes so violently, that I could
not stir out of my cave for several days. -
In this season I was much surprised with the
increase of my family: I had been concerned for
the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me,
or, as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no
more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment,
she came home about the end of August, with
three kittens. This was the more strange to me,
because though I had killed a wild cat, as I called
it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite dif.
ferent kind from our European cats; yet the young
cats were the same kind of house breed like the
old one; and both my cats being females, I thought
it very strange: but from these three cats, I after-
wards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts,
and to drive them from my house as much as
possible.
From the fourteenth of August to the twenty-
sixth, incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and
was now very careful not to be much wet. In
this confinement I began to be straitened for food;
but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat:
and the last day, which was the twenty-sixth,
found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to
me; and my food was regulated thus: I eat a
bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled
(for to my great misfortune I had no vessel to boil
or stew any thing), and two or three of the turtle’s
eggs for supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the
rain, I worked daily two or three hours at enlarg-
ing my cave; and, by degrees, worked it on to-
wards one side, till I came to the outside of the
hill, and made a door or way out, which came be-
yond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out
this way: but I was not perfectly easy at laying
so open; for as I had managed myself before, I
was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now I thought
Ilay exposed; and yet I could not perceive that
there was any living thing to fear, the biggest crea-
ture that I had seen upon the island being a
goat.
September the thirtieth. I was now come to the
unhappy anniversary of my landing: I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious ex-
ercise, prostrating myself to the ground with the
most serious humiliation, confessing myself to GoD,
acknowledging his righteous judgment upon me,
and praying to him to have mercy on me, through
Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least re-
freshment for twelve hours, even to the going down
of the sun, I then eat a biscuit-cake, and a bunch
of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I
began it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for
as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind,
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary
for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know
what any of the days were; but now, having cast
up the days as above, I found I had been there a
year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart
every seventh day for a Sabbath; though 1 found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two of
my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and
so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and
to write down only the most remarkable events of
my life, without continuing a daily memorandum
of other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide
them so as to provide for them accordingly. But I
bought all my experience before I had it; and this
I am going to relate, was one of the most discou-
raging experiments that I made at all. I have
mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley
and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring
up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there
were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty
of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow
it after the rains, the sun being in its southern po-
sition going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well
as I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was
sowing, it casually occurred to my thought, that
I would not sow it all at first, because I did not
know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed
about two thirds of the seeds, leaving about an
handful of each. It was a great comfort to me
afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of that
I sowed this time came to any thing; for the dry
months following, the earth having had no rain
after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to
assist its growth, and never came up at all, till the
wet season had come again, and then it grew as if
it had been newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in ; and I
dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and
sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little be-
fore the vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, sprung up
very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but
having part of the seed left only, and not daring to
sow all that I had yet, I had but a small quantity
at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half
a peck of each kind. - -
But by this experience I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly when the proper season
was to sow ; and that I might expect two seed
times, and two harvests every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little
discovery, which was of use to me afterwards. As
soon as the rains were over, and the weather began
to settle, which was about the month of Novem-
ber, I made a visit up the country to my bower,
where though I had not been some months, yet I
found all things just as I left them. The circle or
double hedge that I had made, was not only firm
and entire, but the stakes which I had cut off of
some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot
out, and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow tree usually shoots the first year after lop-
ping its head. I could not tell what tree to call
it that these stakes were cut from. I was sur-
prised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young
trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up
to grow as much alike as I could, and it is scarce
credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in
three years; so that though the hedge made a circle
VOL. I. L

of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the
trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered
it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge
under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle
round my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling,
which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at above eight yards distance from
my first fence, they grew presently, and were at
first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards
served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its
order.
I found now, that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter,
as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the
dry seasons, which were generally thus:
Half Feb 9 - -

Half October, )
November,
December | Dry, the sun being then to the

Half February,
The rainy season sometimes held longer or
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this
was the general observation I made. After I had
found, by experience, the ill consequence of being
abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself
with provision beforehand, that I might not be
obliged to go out; and I sat within doors as much
as possible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment, (and
very suitable also to the time) for I found great
occasion of many things which I had no way to
furnish myself with, but by hard labour and con-
stant application : particularly, I tried many ways
to make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could
get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they
would do nothing. It proved of excellent advan-
tage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to
take great delight in standing at a basket-maker’s
in the town where my father lived, to see them
make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually
are, very officious to help, and a great observer of
the manner how they worked those things, and
sometimes lent a hand, I had by this means so full
knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
L 2
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut
my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as
the sallows and willows, and osiers, in England;
and I resolved to try.
Accordingly the next day I went to my coun-
try house, as I called it, and cutting some of the
smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the
next time prepared with an hatchet to cut down a
quantity, which I soon found, for there was a
great plenty of them: these I set up to dry within
my circle or hedges; and when they were fit for
use, I carried them to my cave; and here during
the next season I employed myself in making (as
well as I could) a great many baskets, both to
carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing, as I
had occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently
serviceable for my purpose; and thus afterwards
I took care never to be without them; and as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially I
made strong deep baskets to place my corn in, in-
stead of sacks, when I should come to have any
quantity of it. -
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see,
if possible, how to supply two wants. I had no
vessels to hold any thing that was liquid, except
two rundlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and
others which were case-bottles square, for the
holding of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much
as a pot to boil any thing in, except a great ket-
tle which I saved out of the ship, and which was
too big for such uses as I desired it for, viz. to
make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The
second thing I would fain have had, was a to-
bacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to make
one; however I found a contrivance for that too
at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows
of stakes of piles, and in this wicker work, all the
summer, or dry season; when another business
took me up more time than it could be imagined I
could spare. - -
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to
see the whole island, and that I had travelled up
the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,
and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the sea-shore on that side: so taking
my gun, and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two
biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When
I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as
above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, Ifairly descried land,
whether an island or continent I could not tell;
but it lay very high, extending from the West
to the W. S. W. at a very great distance; by my
guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty
leagues off.
L 3
I could not tell what part of the world this
might be, otherwise than that I knew it must be
part of America; and, as I concluded by all my
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse
condition than I was now ; and therefore I acqui-
esced in the dispositions of Providence, which I
began now to own, and to believe, ordered every
thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with
this, and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes
of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I
should certainly, one time or other, see some ves-
sels pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then
it was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and Brasil, which were indeed the worst of savages;
for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not
to murder and devour all the human bodies that
fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very lei-
surely forward. I found that side of the island
where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the
open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers
and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw
abundance of parrots, and fain would F have
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame,
and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some
pains taken, catch a young parrot; for I knocked
it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I
brought it home, but it was some years before I
could make him speak. However, at last I taught
him to call me by my name, very familiarly : but
the accident that followed, though it be a trifle,
will be very diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low grounds, hares as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with ; nor could Isatisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several: but I
had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too: espe-
cially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and
turtle or tortoise; which, added to my grapes,
Leadenhall market could not have furnished a
better table than I, in proportion to the company:
and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I
had great cause for thankfulness, that I was not
driven to any extremities for food; but rather
plenty, even to dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so
many turns and returns, to see what discoveries I
could make, that I came weary enough to the
place where I resolved to sit down for all night;
and then either reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
rounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in
the ground, either from one tree to another, or so
as no wild creature could come at me without
waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was sur-
L 4
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island; for here indeed the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on
the other side I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls
of many kinds, some of which I had not seen be-
fore, and many of them very good meat; but such
as I knew not the names of except those called
penguins. -
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot: and there-
fore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on ; and though there
were many more goats here than on the other side
of the island, yet it was with much more difficulty
that I could come near them; the country being
flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than
when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least incli-
nation to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation,
it became natural to me; and I seemed all the
while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey,
and from home. However, I travelled along the
shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose, about
twelve miles; and then setting up a great pole upon
the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again; and the next journey I took should be on
the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round, till I came to my post again: of
which in its place.
, I took another way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so
much in my view, that I could not miss finding
my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I
found myself mistaken ; for being come about two
or three miles, I found myself descended into a
very large valley; but so surrounded with hills,
and those hills covered with woods, that I could
not see which was my way by any direction but
that of the sun; nor even then, unless I knew
very well the position of the sun at that time of
the day. - . . . . "
It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while
I was in this valley; and not being able to see the
sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at
last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for
my post, and come back the same way I went; and
then by easy journies I turned homeward, the wea-
ther being exceeding hot; and my gun, ammuni-
tion, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid,
and seized upon it; and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I
had a great mind to bring it home, if I could ; for
I had often been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed
of tame goats, which might supply me when my
powder and shot should be spent. -
I made a collar for this little creature; and with
a string which I made of some rope-yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him along, though
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there I inclosed him, and left him; for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to
me to come into my old hutch, and lie down in
my hammock-bed: this little wandering journey,
without a settled place of abode, had been so un-
pleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared
to that ; and it rendered every thing about me so
comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a
great way from it again, while it should be my lot
to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
myself after my long journey; during which, most
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be
a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began now to think of the poor
kid, which I had pent in within my little circle,
and resolved to go and fetch it home, and give it
some food: accordingly I went, and found it where
I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but was
almost starved for want of food. I went and cut
boughs of trees and branches of such shrubs as I
could find, and threw it over; and having fed it,
I tied it as I did before to lead it away; but it was
so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to
have tied it; for it followed me like a dog; and as
I continually fed it, the creature became so loving,
so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that
time one of my domestics also, and would never
leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 80th of September in
the same solemn manner as before, being the anni-
versary of my landing on the island, having now
been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there. I
spent the whole day in humble and thankful ac-
knowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
which my solitary condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks,
that God had been pleased to discover to me, even
that it was possible I might be more happy in this
solitary condition, than I should have been in a
liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the
world: that he could fully make up to me the de-
ficiencies of my solitary state and the want of hu-
man society, by his presence, and the communica-
tion of his grace to my soul, supporting, comfort-
ing, and encouraging me to depend upon his pro-
vidence here, and hope for his eternal presence
hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked cursed
abominable life I led all the past part of my days;
and now, having changed both my sorrows and my
joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gust, and my delights were perfectly new
from what they were at first coming, or indeed for
the two years past. -
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me,
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts
I was in ; and how I was a prisoner, locked up
with the eternal bolts and bars of the ocean, in an
uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In
the midst of the greatest composures of my mind,
this would break out upon me like a storm, and
made me wring my hands, and weep like a child.
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my
work, and I would immediately sit down and
sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two
together; and this was still worse to me; for if I
could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words,
it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted
itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and ap-
plied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning, being very sad, I opened the bible
upon these words, “I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee!” Immediately it occurred, that
these words were to me, why else should they be
directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of GoD and man 2 Well then, said I, if
GoD does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
can it be, or what matters it, though the world
should all forsake me; seeing on the other hand,
if I had all the world, and should lose the favour
and blessing of God, there would be no comparison
in the loss 2
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was pro-
bable I should have ever been in any other parti-
cular state in the world; and with this thought I
was going to give thanks to GoD for bringing me
to this place. - -
I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak
the words. How canst thou be such an hypocrite
(said I, even audibly), to pretend to be thankful
for a condition, which, however thou mayestendea-
vour to be contented with, thou wouldest rather
pray heartily to be delivered from ? So I stopped
there; but though I could not say I thanked GoD
for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to GoD
for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting provi-
dences, to see the former condition of my life, and
to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never
opened the bible, or shut it, but my very soul
within me blessed God for directing my friend in
England, without any order of mine, to pack it up
among my goods; and for assisting me afterwards
to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began
my third year; and though I have not given the
reader the trouble of so particular an account of
my works this year as at the first, yet in general
it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle;
having regularly divided my time, according to
the several daily employments that were before
me; such as, first, my duty to GoD, and reading
the scriptures, which I constantly set apart some
time for, thrice every day. Secondly, the going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally
took me up three hours every morning when it
did not rain. Thirdly, the ordering, curing,
preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
caught for my supply. These took up great part
of the day. Also it is to be considered, that in the
middle of the day, when the sun was in the ze-
nith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir
out; so that about four hours in the evening was
all the time I could be supposed to work in ; with
this exception, that sometimes I changed my
hours of hunting and working, and went to work
in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the
afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire
may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my
work; the many hours which, for want of tools,
want of help, and want of skill, every thing that I
did took up out of my time: for example, I was
full two-and-forty days making me a board for a
long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas
two sawyers, with their tools and saw-pit, would have
cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day.
My case was this: It was to be a large tree
which was to be cut down, because my board was
to be a broad one. The tree I was three days a
cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs,
and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both
the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light
enough to move ; then I turned it, and made one
side of it smooth and flat, as a board, from end to
end: then turning that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the plank to be about three
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one
may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece
of work; but labour and patience carried me
through that and many other things; I only ob-
serve this in particular, to shew the reason why
so much of my time went away with so little work,
viz. That what might be a little to be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with patience and la-
bour I went through many things, and indeed every
thing that my circumstances made necessary for
me to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now in the months of November and De-
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost
one whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but
now my crop promised very well, when on a sud-
den I found I was in danger of losing it all again
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce
possible to keep from it; at first, the goats, and
wild creatures which I called hares, which, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day,
as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for, but by making an
inclosure about it with an hedge, which I did with
a great deal of toil; and the more, because it re-
quired a great deal of speed; the creatures daily
spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally
well fenced in about three weeks time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I set
my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to
a stake at the gate, where he would stand and
bark all night long : so in a little time the enemies
forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my
corn was in the blade, so the birds were as like to
ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for going
along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my
little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not
how many sorts, which stood as it were watching
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among
them, (for I always had my gun with me.) I had
no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud
of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among
the corn itself. - -
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that
in a few days they would devour all my hopes:
that I should be starved, and never be able to
raise a crop at all; and what to do I could not
tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day.
In the first place, I went among it to see what
damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet
too green for them, the loss was not so great, but
the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it
could be saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon
all the trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the event proved it to be so;
for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no
sooner out of their sight, but they dropped down
one by one into the corn again. I was so provoked,
that I could not have patience to stay till more
came on, knowing that every grain that they eat
now was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in
the consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I
fired again, and killed three of them. This was
what I wished for; so I took them up, and served
them as we serve notorious thieves in England,
viz. hanged them in chains, for a terror to others.
It is impossible to imagine almost, that this should
have such an effect as it had ; for the fowls would
VOL. I. M
not only not come at the corn, but in short they
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never
see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows
hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one
as well as I could, out of one of the broad-swords,
or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of
the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I
had no great difficulty to cut it down : in short, I
reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which
I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands:
and at the end of all my harvesting I found, that
out of my half-peck of seed, I had near two
bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half
of barley, that is to say, by my guess, for I had
no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to
me; and I foresaw that in time it would please
God to supply me with bread: and yet here I was
perplexed again; for I neither knew how to grind
or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean
it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to
make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it. These things being
added to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all
for seed against the next season, and in the mean
time to employ all my study and hours of working
to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe
few people have thought much upon; viz. the
strange multitude of little things necessary in the
providing, producing, curing, dressing, making,
and finishing, this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made
more and more sensible of it every hour, even after
. I got the first handful of seed corn, which, as I have
said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by mak-
ing a wooden spade, as I observed before, but this
did my work but in a wooden manner; and though
it cost me a great many days to make it, yet for
want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but
made my work the harder, and made it be per-
formed much worse.
However, this I bore with too, and was content
to work it out with patience, and bear with the
badness of the performance. When the corn was
sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over
it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree
over it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called,
rather than rake or harrow it.
M 2
When it was growing or grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it,
secure it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home,
thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake
it in; and all these things I did without, as shall
be observed ; and yet the corn was an inestimable
comfort and advantage to me too : but all this, as
I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to
me, but that there was no help for; neither was
my time so much loss to me, because I had divided
it. A certain part of it was every day appointed
to these works; and as I resolved to use none of the
corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, .
I had the next six months to apply myself, wholly
by labour and invention, to furnish myself with
utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for the making the corn, when I had it,
fit for my use.
But first I was to prepare more land, for I had
now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground.
Before I did this, I had a week’s work at least to
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was a
very sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required
double labour to work with it; however, I went
through that, and sowed my seeds in two large flat
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that
wood which I had set before, which I knew would
grow; so that in one year's time I knew I should
have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take
me up less than three months; because great part
of that time was in the wet season, when I could
not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
occasion, always observing, that all the while I
was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my
parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly
learnt him to know his own name; at last, to speak
it out pretty loud, Poll; which was the first word
I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth
but my own. This therefore was not my work,
but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I
had a great employment upon my hands, as fol-
lows: viz. I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to
come at them : however, considering the heat of
the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out
any such clay, I might botch up some such pot,
as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough,
and strong enough, to bear handling, and to hold
any thing that was dry, and required to be kept
so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn,
meal, &c. which was the thing I was upon, I re-
solved to make some as large as I could, and fit
only to stand like jars to hold what should be put
into them.
M 3
It would make the reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many aukward ways I
took to raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly
things I made, how many of them fell in, and how
many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over violent heat of the sun, being set out too
hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only
removing, as well before as after they were dried;
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard
to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home, and work it, I could not make above two
large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jars,
in about two months labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set
them down again in two greater wicker baskets,
which I had made on purpose for them, that they
might not break; and, as between the pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed
it full of the rice and barley straw; and these two
pots being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when the
corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand
turned to ; and the heat of the sun baked them
strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid,
and bear the fire, which none of these could do.
It happened after some time, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro-
ken piece of one of my earthen-ware vessels in the
fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I
was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to my-
self, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so
as to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion
of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing
them with lead, though I had some lead to do it
with ; but I placed three large pipkins, and two
or three pots, in a pile one upon another, and
placed my fire-wood all round it, with a great heap
of embers under them: I plied the fire with fresh
fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw
the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all : when I
saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat
about five or six hours, till I found one of them,
though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the
sand which was mixed with the clay, melted by
the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on ; so I slacked my fire gra-
dually, till the pots began to abate of the red co-
lour; and watching them all night, that I might
not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I
had three very good, I will not say handsome pip-
M 4
kins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as
could be desired; and one of them perfectly glazed
with the running of the sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I
wanted no sort of earthen-ware for my use ; but
I must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may suppose,
when I had no way of making them, but as the
children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would
make pies that never learnt to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly pa-
tience to stay till they were cold, before I set one
upon the fire again, with some water in it, to boil
me some meat, which I did admirably well; and
with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth,
though I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingre-
dients requisite to make it so good as I would have
had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar
to stamp or beat some corn in ; for as to the mill,
there was no thought of arriving to that perfection
of art with one pair of hands. To supply this
want, I was at a great loss; for of all trades in the
world I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-
cutter, as for any whatever; neither had I any
tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to
find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow,
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at
all, except what was in the solid rock, and which
I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were
the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would
neither bear the weight of an heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand;
so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a
great block of hard wood, which I found indeed
much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, with
the help of fire and infinite labour, made an hollow
place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy-pestle
or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood; and
this I prepared and laid by against I had my next
crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind,
or rather pound, my corn or meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce,
to dress my meal, and part it from the bran and
the husk, without which I did not see it possible I
could have any bread. This was a most difficult
thing, so much as but to think on ; for to be sure,
I had nothing like the necessary things to make
it with ; I mean fine thin canvass, or stuff, to searce
the meal through. And here I was at a full stop
for many months; nor did I really know what to
do: linen I had none left but what was mere rags;
I had goat's hair, but neither knew I how to weave
or spin it; and had I known how, here were no
tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found
for this, was, that at last I did remember I had
among the seamen's clothes, which were saved out
of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin;
and with some pieces of these I made three small
sieves, but proper enough for the work: and thus
I made shift for some years; how I did afterwards,
I shall shew in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be con-
sidered, and how I should make bread when I
came to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As
to that part, there was no supplying the want, so
I did not concern myself much about it. But for
an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I
found out an experiment for that also, which was
this: I made some earthen vessels very broad, but
not deep; that is to say, about two feet diameter,
and not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them
by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with some
square tiles of my own making and burning also ;
but I should not call them square. -
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon
this hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot: then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf,
or loaves; and whelming down the earthen pot
upon them, drew the embers all round the outside
of the pot, to keep in, and add to the heat: and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I
baked my barley-loaves, and became in a little
time a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I
made myself several cakes of the rice, and pud-
dings; indeed I made no pies, neither had I any
thing to put into them, supposing I had, except
the flesh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most part of the third year of my
abode here; for it is to be observed, that in the
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: for I reaped my corn
in its season, and carried it home as well as I could,
and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till
I had time to rub it out; for I had no floor to
thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.
And now indeed, my stock of corn increasing,
I really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted
a place to lay it up in ; for the increase of the corn
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more ; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to
use it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a
great while: also I resolved to see what quantity
would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to
sow but once a year.
. Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels
of barley and rice were much more than I could
consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may
be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the
prospect of land which I had seen from the other
side of the island; and I was not without secret
wishes that I was on shore there, fancying that
seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself far-
ther, and perhaps at last find some means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I mightfall
into the hands of Savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into
their power, I should run an hazard more than a
thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of
being eaten; for I had heard that the people of
the Caribean coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters;
and I knew by the latitude that I could not be
far off from that shore: that, suppose they were
not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had
been served, even when they had been ten or
twenty together; much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. All these
things, I say, which I ought to have considered
well of, and I did cast up in my thoughts after-
wards, yet took none of my apprehensions at first;
and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of
getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long
boat with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which
I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of
Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I
would go and look on our ship's boat, which, as I
have said, was blown up upon the shore a great
way in the storm, when we were first cast away.
She lay almost where she did at first, but not
quite ; and was turned, by the force of the waves
and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the
high ridge of a beachy rough sand, but no water
about her as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and
have launched her into the water, the boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brasils with her easy enough; but I
might have easily foreseen, that I could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom,
than I could remove the island. However I went
to the wood, and cut levers and rollers, and brought
them to the boat, resolving to try what I could
do ; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn
her down, I might easily repair the damage she
had received, and she would be a very good boat,
and I might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about
it: at last finding it impossible to heave it up with
my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand
to undermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting
pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir
it up again, or to get under it, much less to move
it forwards towards the water; so I was forced to
give it over: and yet, though I gave over hopes
of the boat, my desire to venture over for the
main increased, rather than decreased, as the means
for it seemed impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking whether it
was not possible to make myself a canoe or pe-
riagua, such as the natives of those climates make,
even without tools, or as I might say, without
hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I
not only thought possible, but easy; and pleased
myself extremely with my thoughts of making it,
and with my having much more convenience for
it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at
all considering the particular inconveniences which
I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want
of hands to move it into the water, when it was
made; a difficulty much harder for me to surmount
than all the consequences of want of tools could
be to them : for what was it to me, that when I
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with
great trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able
with my tools to hew and dub the outside into a
proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the
inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it;
if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the
Water?
One would have thought, I could not have had
the least reflection upon my mind of my circum-
stances, while I was making my boat, but I should
have immediately thought how I should get it
into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon
my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once
considered how I should get it off the land; and
it was really in its own nature more easy for me to
guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about
forty-five fathom of land, where it lay, to set it
afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a
fool that ever man did, who had any of his senses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my
own inquiries into it by this foolish answer, which
I gave myself; Let me first make it, I will war-
rant I will find some way or other to get it along,
when it is done.
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, and felled a cedar tree: I question much
whether Solomon ever had such an one for the
building the temple of Jerusalem; it was five feet
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the
end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for
a while, and then parted into branches. It was
not without infinite labour that I felled this tree;
I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the
bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut
off, which I hacked and hewed through with my
axe and hatchet, with inexpressible labour; after
this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it to
a proportion, and to something like the bottom of
a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to
do. It cost me near three months more to clear
the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact
boat of it: this I did indeed without fire, by mere
mallet and chissel, and by the dint of hard labour;
till I had brought it to be a very handsome pe-
riagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-
twenty men, and consequently big enough to have
carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was
extremely delighted with it: the boat was really
much bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua,
that was made of one tree, in my life; many a
weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure, for
there remained nothing but to get it into the
water; and had I gotten it into the water, I make
no question but I should have begun the maddest
voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed,
that ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, though they cost infinite labour too; it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface
of the earth, and so make a declivity; this I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who
grudge pains that have their deliverance in view 2
But when this was worked through, and this diffi-
culty managed, it was still much at one; for I could
no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water
up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water. Well, I began this work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff
to be thrown out, I found, that by the number of
hands I had, being none but my own, it must have
been ten or twelve years before I should have gone
through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at
the upper end it must have been at least twenty
feet deep; so at length, though with great reluc-
tancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with
the same devotion, and with as much comfort, as
ever before; for by a constant study, and serious
application of the word of God, and by the assist-
ance of his grace, I gained a different knowledge
from what I had before ; I entertained different
notions of things; I looked now upon the world as
VOL. I. N
a thing remote; which I had nothing to do with,
no expectation from, and indeed no desires about:
in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor
was ever like to have; so I thought it looked, as we
may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place
I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well I
might say, as father Abraham to Dives, Between
me and thee there is a great gulph fixed.
In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here : I had neither the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of
life: I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was
now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole
manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king
or emperor over the whole country which I had
possession of: there were no rivals: I had no com-
petitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command
with me; I might have raised ship-loadings of corn,
but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I
thought enough for my occasion: I had tortoises, or
turtles enough; but now and then one was as much
as I could put to any use: I had timber enough to
have built a fleet of ships; I had grapes enough to
have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to
have loaded that fleet when they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was all that was
valuable : I had enough to eat, and to supply my
wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or
the vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled : the trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more
use of them than for fuel; and that I had no occa-
sion for, but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the
good things of this world are no farther good to
us than as they are for our use: and that what-
ever we may heap up indeed to give to others, we
enjoy as much as we can use, and no more. The
most covetous griping miser in the world would
have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if he
had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no
room for desire, except it was of things which I
had not, and they were but trifles, though indeed
of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a
parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about
thirty-six pounds sterling; alas! there the nasty,
sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of busi-
ness for it; and I often thought with myself, that
I would have given an handful of it for a gross of
tobacco-pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my
corn ; nay, I would have given it all for six-penny
worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or
for an handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of
ink: as it was, I had not the least advantage by
it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in
the wet season; and if I had had the drawerfull of
diamonds, it had been the same case; and they
had been of no manner of value to me, because of
IlO LISe.
N 2
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently
sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and ad-
mired the hand of God’s providence, which had
thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned
to look more upon the bright side of my condition,
and less upon the dark side; and to consider what
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and this
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I
cannot express them; and which I take notice of
here, to put those discontented people in mind of
it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what GoD hath
given them, because they see and covet something
that he has not given them: all our discontents
about what we want appeared to me to spring from
the want of thankfulness for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall
into such distress as mine was; and this was, to
compare my present condition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good providence of GoD
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast
up near to the shore, where I not only could come
at her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore for my relief and comfort; without which
I had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence,
or gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in
representing to myself in the most lively colours,
how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out
of the ship; how I could not have so much as got
any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it
was long before I found any of them, I must have
perished first : that H should have lived, if I had
not perished, like a mere savage: that if I had
killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had
no way to slay or open them, or part the flesh
from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but
must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my
claws, like a beast. - . .
These reflections made me very sensible of the
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my present condition, with all its hardships
and misfortunes: and this part also I cannot but
recommend to the reflection of those who are apt
in their misery to say, Is any affliction like mine?
Let them consider, how much worse the cases of
some people are, and what their case might have
been, if Providence had thought fit.
I had another reflection which assisted me also
to comfort my mind with hopes; and this was,
comparing my present condition with what I had
deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from
the hand of Providence; I had lived a dreadful
life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear
of God : I had been well instructed by my father
and mother; neither had they been wanting to
me in their early endeavours, to infuse a religious
awe of GoD into my mind, a sense of my duty,
and of what the nature and end of my being re-
N 3
quired of me. But, alas! falling early into the sea-
faring life, which of all the lives is the most destitute
of the fear of GoD, though his terrors are always
before them; I say, falling early into the sea-
faring life, and into seafaring company, all that
little sense of religion which I had entertained,
was laughed out of me by my messmates; by an
hardened despising of dangers, and the views of
death, which grew habitual to me; by my long
absence from all manner of opportunities to converse
with any thing but what was like myself, or to hear
any thing of what was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or
of the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that
in the greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the
Portuguese master of the ship, my being planted
so well, in Brasil, my receiving the cargo from
England, and the like, I never once had the words
Thank God, so much as on my mind, or in my mouth;
nor in the greatest distress, had I so much thought
as to pray to him; nor so much as to say, Lord have
mercy upon me! No, not to mention the name of
GoD, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular
providences had attended me, since my coming
into this place, and how GoD had dealt bountifully
with me; had not only punished me less than my
iniquity deserved, but had so plentifully provided
for me; this gave me great hopes that my repen-
tance was accepted, and that GoD had yet mercies
in store for me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up,
not only to resignation to the will of God in the
present disposition of my circumstances, but even
to a sincere thankfulness of my condition; and
that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to
complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of
my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies, which
I had no reason to have expected in that place;
that I ought never more to repine at my condition,
but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that
daily bread which nothing but a cloud of wonders
could have brought: that I ought to consider I
had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long
series of miracles; and that I could hardly have
named a place in the uninhabited part of the world,
where I could have been cast more to my advan-
tage: a place where, as I had no society, which
was my affliction on one hand, so I found no ra.
venous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to
threaten my life; no venomous creatures, or poi-
sonous, which I might have fed on to my hurt; no
savages to murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one
way, so it was a life of mercy another: and I
wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, but
to be able to make my sense of God’s goodness to
N 4
me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily
consolation; and after I made a just improvement
of these things, I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which I brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper: as
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me; and first, by casting up
times past, I remember that there was a strange
concurrence of days, in the various providences
which befel me, and which, if I had been super-
stitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or for-
tunate, I might have had reason to have looked
upon with a great deal of curiosity. •
First, I had observed, that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and
ran away to Hull in order to go to sea, the same
day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of
war, and made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of
the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that
same day of the year afterwards I made my escape
from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
20th of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved 26 years after, when I was cast
*
on shore in this island; so that my wicked life, and
solitary life, both began on a day. º
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was
that of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I
brought out of the ship. This I had husbanded to
the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of
bread a day, for above a year: and yet I was quite
without bread for a year before I got any corn of
my own; and great reason I had to be thankful
that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has
been already observed, next to miraculous. r
My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to
linen, I had none a good while, except some che-
quered shirts which I found in the chests of the
other seamen, and which I carefully preserved,
because many times I could bear no other clothes
on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me,
that I had among all the men's clothes of the ship
almost three dozen of shirts. There were also
several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which
were left behind, but they were too hot to wear;
and though it is true, that the weather was so
violent hot that there was no need of clothes, yet
I could not go quite naked; no, though I had been
inclined to it, which I was not; nor could I abide
the thoughts of it, though I was all alone. “
One reason why I could not go quite naked,
was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well
when quite naked, as with some clothes on ; nay,
the very heat frequently blistered myskin; whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion,
and whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler
than without it: no more could I ever bring my-
self to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap
or an hat; the heat of the sun beating with such
violence as it does in that place, would give me
the head-ach presently, by darting so directly on
my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could
not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would
presently go away.
Upon these views I began to consider about
putting the few rags I had, which I called clothes,
into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoats
I had, and my business was now to try if I could
not make jackets out of the great watch-coats
which I had by me, and with such other materials
as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather in-
deed a-botching; for I made most piteous work
of it. However, I made shift to make two or three
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but very
sorry shift indeed, till afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all
the creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed
ones; and I had hung them up stretched out with
sticks in the sun; by which means some of them
were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little;
but others, it seems, were very useful. The first
thing I made of these was a great cap for my
head, with the hair on the outside to shoot off the
rain; and this I performed so well, that after this I
made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins; that
is to say, a waistcoat and breeches open at the
knees, and both loose; for they were rather wanted
to keep me cool, than to keep me warm. I must
not omit to acknowledge, that they were wretch-
edly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a
worse tailor: however, they were such as I made a
very good shift with ; and when I was abroad, if it
happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap
being outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want
of one, and had a great mind to make one: I had
seen them made in the Brasils, where they are very
useful in the great heats which are there; and I
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater
too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I
took a world of pains at it, and was a great while
before I could make anything likely to hold; nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two
or three before I made one to my mind; but at
last I made one that answered indifferently well;
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let
down. I could make it to spread; but if it did
not let down too, and draw in, it would not be
portable for me any way, but just over my head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said,
I made one to answer; I covered it with skins,
the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like
a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually,
that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather,
with greater advantage than I could before in the
coolest; and when I had no need of it, I could
close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed by resigning to the will of GoD,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of
his Providence: this made my life better than so-
ciable; for when I began to regret the want of
conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus
conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and,
as I hope, I may say, with even my Maker, by eja-
culations and petitions, was not better than the
utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?
I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any
extraordinary thing happened to me; but I lived
on in the same course, in the same posture and
place just as before : the chief thing I was em-
ployed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my
barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both
which I always kept up just enough to have suffi-
cient stock of the year's provisions beforehand; I
say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour
of going out with my gun, I had one labour to
make me a canoe, which at last I finished: so that
by digging a canal to it, six feet wide, and four
feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half
a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big,
as I made it without considering beforehand, as I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it;
so never being able to bring it to the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be
wiser next time. Indeed the next time though
I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a
place where I could not get the water to it, at any
less distance than, as I have said, of near half a
mile ; yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never
gave it over ; and though I was near two years
about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes
of having a boat to go off to sea at last. --
However, though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view, when I made the first;
I mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as
I had a boat, my next design was to make a tour
round the island; but as I had been on the other
side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey, made me very eager to see the
other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I
thought of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every
thing with discretion and consideration, I fitted
up a little mast to my boat, and made a sail to it
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails, which
lay in store, and of which I had a great store by
Ine.
. . Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the
boat, I found she would sail very well. Then I
made little lockers and boxes at each end of my
boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammuni-
tion, &c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or
the spray of the sea; and a little long hollow place
I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay
my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep
it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern,
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus
I every now and then took a little voyage upon
the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little creek; but at last, being eager to view the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved
upon my tour, and accordingly I victualled my
ship for the voyage; putting in two dozen of my
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley-
bread; an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food
I eat a great deal of; a little bottle of rum, half a
goat, and powder with shot for killing more, and
two large watch-coats, of those which, as I men-
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamen’s
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other
to cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year
of my reign, or my captivity, which you please,
that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much
longer than I expected: for though the island
itself was not very large, yet when I came to the
east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie
out about two leagues into the sea, some above
water, some under it; and beyond this a shoal of
sand, lying dry half a league more; so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that
point. -
When I first discovered them, I was going to
give over my enterprize, and come back again, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
sea, and above all, doubting how I should get back
again; so I came to an anchor, for I had made me
a kind of an anchor, with a piece of broken grap-
pling which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and
went on shore, climbing up an hill, which seemed
to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent
of it, and resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I
stood, I perceived a strong, and indeed, a most fu-
rious current, which ran to the east, even came
close to the point; and I took the more notice of
it, because I saw there might be some danger,
that when I came into it, I might be carried out
to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again. And indeed, had I not
gotten first upon this hill, I believe it would have
been so ; for there was the same current on the
other side of the island, only that it set it off at a
farther distance; and I saw there was a strong
eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but
to get out of the first current, and I should presently
be in an eddy. -
Ilay here, however, two days; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (E. at S. E. and that being
just contrary to the said current) made a great
breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was
not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for
the breach, nor to go too far off because of the
Stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ven-
tured; but I am a warning-piece again to all rash
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to
the point, when I was not my boat's length from
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It
carried my boat along with it with such violence,
that all I could do could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it: but I found it hurried me far-
ther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all that I could do with my paddles sig-
nified nothing : and now I began to give myself
over for lost; for, as the current was on both sides
the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably
gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it:
so that I had no prospect before me but of perish-
ing; not by the sea, for that was calm enough,
but of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a
tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a
great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my
earthen pots: but what was all this to being driven
into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was
no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand
leagues at least!
And now I saw how easy it was for the Pro-
vidence of God to make the most miserable condi-
tion that mankind could be in worse. Now I
looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as
the most pleasant place in the world, and all the
happiness my heart could wish for, was to be there
again. I stretched out my hand to it with eager
wishes; O happy desert, said I, I shall never see
thee more | O miserable creature! said I, whither
am I going! Then I reproached myself with my
unthankful temper, and how I had repined at my
solitary condition; and now what would I give to
be on shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition, till it is illustrated to
us by its contraries; nor know how to value what
we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce pos-
sible to imagine the consternation I was now in,
being driven from my beloved island (for so it ap-
peared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, al-
most two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard,
till indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and
kept my boat as much to the northward, that is,
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay
on, as possibly I could ; when about noon, as the
sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little
breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the
VOL. I. o
S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and espe-
cially when in about half an hour more, it blew a
pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was got-
ten at a frightful distance from the island; and,
had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I
had been undone another way too; for I had no
compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if I had
but once lost sight of it; but the weather continu-
ing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again,
and spread my sail, standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clear-
ness of the water, some alteration of the current
was near; for where the current was so strong, the
water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to
the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks I found caused the
current to part again; and as the main stress of it
ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of
the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back
again to the north-west with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such like extremities, may guess
what my present surprise of joy was, and how
gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy ;
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread
my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind,
and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the island, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at first; so
that when I came near the island, I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say,
the other end of the island, opposite to that which
I went out from. -
When I had made something more than a league
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and saved me no farther. However,
I found, that being between the two great cur-
rents, viz. that on the south side which had hur-
ried me away, and that on the north, which lay
about two leagues on the other side; I say, be-
tween these two, in the west of the island, I found
the water at least still, and running no way; and
having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on
steering directly for the island, though not making
such fresh way as I did before.
About four o'clock, in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the
point of the rocks which occasioned this distance,
stretching out as is described before, to the south-
ward, and casting off the current more southerly,
had of course made another eddy to the north;
and this I found very strong, but directly setting
the way my course lay, which was due west, but
O 2
almost full north. However, having a fresh gale,
I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west,
and in about an hour came within about a mile of
the shore: it being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and
gave God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to
lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my
boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I
had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a
little cove that I had espied under some trees, and
laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the
labour and fatigue of the voyage. -
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and
knew too much the case, to think of attempting
it by the way I went out; and what might be at
the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I
only resolved in the morning to make my way
westward along the shore, and to see if there was
no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety,
so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I
came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet, or brook, where I found a convenient har-
bour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her: here
I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I
went on shore to look about me, and see where I
WàS.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the
place where I had been before when I travelled on
foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of my
boatbut my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceed-
ing hot, I began my march : the way was comfort-
able enough after such a voyage as I had been upon,
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where
I found every thing standing as I left it; for I
always kept it in good order, being, as I said be-
fore, my country-house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell asleep: but judge you, if you can, that read
my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I
was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me
by my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe Where are you, Ro-
bin Crusoe Where are you? Where have you
been 2
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did
not awake thoroughly; and dozing between sleep-
ing and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to me: but as the voice continued to repeat
Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to
awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully
frighted, and started up in the utmost consterna-
tion: but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw
my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and im-
mediately knew that this was he that spoke to me;
o 3
for just in such bemoaning language I had used to
talk to him, and teach him ; and he had learned
it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger,
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, Poor
Robin Crusoe, Where are you? Where have you
been 2 How came you here —and such things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the par-
rot, and that indeed it could be nobody else, it
was a good while before I could compose myself.
First, I was amazed how the creature got thither,
and then how he should just keep about the place,
and no where else : but as I was well satisfied it
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got it over;
and holding out my hand, and calling him by his
name, Poll, the sociable creature came to me, and
sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued
talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and, how did I
come here 2 and where had I been 2 just as if he
had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I car-
ried him home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for
some time, and had enough to do for many days
to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had my
boat again on my side of the island, but I knew
not how it was practicable to get it about. As to
the east-side of the island, which I had gone round,
I knew well enough there was no venturing that
way; my very heart would shrink, and my very
blood run chill, but to think of it; and to the other
side of the island, I did not know how it might be
there; but supposing the current ran with the
same force against the shore at the east, as it passed
by it on the other, I might run the same risk of
being driven down the stream, and carried by the
island, as I had been before of being carried away
from it: so with these thoughts I contented my-
self to be without any boat, though it had been
the product of so many months labour to make it,
and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained
near a year, lived a very sedate retired life, as you
may well suppose; and my thoughts being very
much composed, as to my condition, and fully
comforted in resigning myself to the dispensations
of Providence, I thought I lived really very hap-
pily in all things except that of society.
I improved myself, in this time, in all the me-
chanic exercises which my necessities put me upon
applying myself to; and I believe could, upon oc-
casion, have made a very good carpenter, especially
considering how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfec-
tion in my earthen-ware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a wheel, which I found infi-
nitely easier and better, because I made things
round and shapeable, which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I never
was more vain of my own performance, or more
joyful for anything I found out, than for my being
able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a
o 4
very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and
only burnt red like other earthen-ware, yet as
it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke,
I, was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had
been always used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards
when I searched the ship again, I could not come
at any pipes at all. :
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as
my invention shewed me, though not very hand-
some, yet convenient for my laying things up in,
or fetching things home in. For example, if I
killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree,
flay it, and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and
bring it home in a basket; and the like by a tur-
tle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a
piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for
me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave
the rest behind me: also large deep baskets were
my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it
in great baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con-
siderably; and this was a want which it was im-
possible for me to supply: then I began seriously
to consider what I must do when I should have
no more powder; that is to say, how I should do
to kill any goats. I had, as I observed, in the
third year of my being here, kept a young kid, ..
and bred her tame; I was in hopes of getting an
he-kid, but I could not by any means bring it to
pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at
last of mere age. -
But being now in the eleventh year of my resi-
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition grow-
ing low, I set myself to study some art to trap
and snare the goats, to see whether I could not
catch some of them alive; and particularly I
wanted a she-goat, great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them;
and believe they were more than once taken in
them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no
wire, and always found them broken, and my bait
devoured. - -
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I
had observed the goats used to feed, and over
these pits I placed hurdles of my own making too,
with a great weight upon them; and several times
I put ears of barley, and dry rice, without setting
the trap; and I could easily perceive that the goats
had gone in, and eaten up the corn, that I could
see the mark of their feet: at length, I set three
traps in one night, and going the next morning,
I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten
and gone. This was very discouraging; however,
I altered my trap; and, not to trouble you with
particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I
found in one of them a large old he-goat; and, in
one of the others, three kids, a male and two
females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him ; he was so fierce I durst not go into the pit
to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted; I could
have killed him, but that was not my business,
nor would it answer my end; so I e'en let him
out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened
out of his wits; but I did not then know what I
afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a
lion : if I had let him stay there three or four days
without food, and then have carried him some
water to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are well used. º
However, for the present I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to the three
kids; and taking them one by one, I tied them
with strings together; and with some difficulty
brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed;
but throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted
them, and they began to be tame: and now I found
that if I expected to supply myself with goat's-
flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my house like a flock of
sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I
must keep the tame from the wild, or else they
would always run wild when they grew up; and
the only way for this was to have some inclosed
piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or
pale, to keep them up so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without
break in. -
This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity
of doing it, my first piece of work was to find out
a proper piece of ground; viz. where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for
them to drink, and cover to keep them from the
SUIIl.
Those who understand such enclosures, will
think I had very little contrivance, when I pitched
upon a place very proper for all these, being a plain
open piece of meadow-land or savanna (as our peo-
ple call it in the western colonies) which had two
or three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one
end was very woody; I say they will smile at my
forecast, when I shall tell them I began my en-
closing of this piece of ground in such a manner,
that my hedge, or pale, must have been at least
two miles about; nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles
about, I was like to have time enough to do it in ;
but I did not consider, that my goats would be as
wild in so much compass, as if they had had the
whole island; and I should have so-much room to
chase them in, that I should never catch them.
My hedge was began and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to
me; so I presently stopped short, and for the first
beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about
150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth,
which as it would maintain as many as I should
have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock in-
creased, I could add more ground, to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it,
I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and
carry them some ears of barley, or an handful of
rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after
my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose,
they would follow me up and down, bleating after
me for an handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and
a half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids
and all; and in two years more I had three-and-
forty, besides several that I took and killed for
my food; and after that I enclosed five several
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens
to drive them into, to take them as I wanted them;
and gates out of one piece of ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had
goat's-flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk
too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not so much as think of, and which, when it came
into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise;
for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature,
who gives supplies of food to every creature, dic-
tates even naturally how to make use of it, so I,
that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw
butter or cheese made, very readily and handily,
though after a great many essays and miscarriages,
made me both butter and cheese at last, and never
wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction . How
can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give
us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons!
What a table was here spread for me in a wilder-
ness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for
hunger! -
It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen
me and my little family sit down to dinner: there
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at abso-
lute command; I could hang, draw, give life and
liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all
my subjects! *
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all
alone, attended by my servants' Poll, as if he had
been my favourite, as the only person permitted
to talk to me; my dog, which was now grown
very old and crazy, and found no species to mul-
tiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand;
and two cats, one on one side the table, and one on
the other, expecting now and then a bit from my
hand, as a mark of special favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my
own hands; but one of them having multiplied by
I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild
into the woods, and became indeed troublesome to
me at last; for they would often come into my
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged
to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at
length they left me with this attendance, and in
this plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be
said to want any thing but society, and of that, in
some time after this, I was like to have too much.
I was something impatient, as I had observed,
to have the use of my boat, though very loth to
run any more hazard: and therefore sometimes I
sat contriving ways to get her about the island,
and at other times I sat myself down contented
enough without her. But I had a strange uneasi-
ness in my mind to go down to the point of the
island, where, as I have said in my last ramble, I
went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how
the current set, that I might see what I had to do:
this inclination increased upon me every day; and
at length I resolved to travel thither by land, and
following the edge of the shore, I did so: but had
any one in England been to meet such a man as I

was, it must either have frighted them, or raised
a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased
to take a sketch of my figure, as follows:
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's-
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to
keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off
from running into my neck; nothing being so
hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's-skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs:
and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same:
the breeches were made of a skin of an old he-
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on
either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the
middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had
none; but I had made me a pair of something, I
scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to
flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat-
terdashes; but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed
were all the rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which
I drew together with two thongs of the same, in-
stead of buckles; and in a kind of frog on either
side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung
a little saw and a hatchet; one on one side, one
on the other: I had another belt not so broad,
and fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left
arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's-skin.
too; in one of which hung my powder, in the
other my shot: at my back I carried my basket,
on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great
clumsy ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after
all, was the most necessary thing I had about me,
next to my gun: as for my face, the colour of it
was really not so Mulatto like, as one might ex-
pect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My
beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about
a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissars
and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, ex-
cept what grew on my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I
saw at Sallee: for the Moors did not wear such,
though the Turks did. Of these mustachios, or
whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to
hang my hat upon them; but they were of length
and shape monstrous enough, and such as in Eng-
land would have passed for frightful. -
But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure,
I had so few to observe me, that it was of no
manner of consequence; so I say no more to that
part: in this kind of figure I went my new jour-
ney, and was out five or six days. I travelled first
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I
first brought my boat to an anchor, to get up upon
the rocks; and, having no boat now to take care
of, I went over the land a nearer way, to the same
height that I was upon before; when looking for-
ward to the point of the rock which lay out, and
which I was to double with my boat, as I said
above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any
more there than in other places. . -
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to spend some time in the observing of it,
to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had oc-
casioned it: but I was presently convinced how it
was ; viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from
some great river on the shore, must be the occasion
of this current; and that according as the wind
blew more forcible from the west, or from the
north, this current came near, or went farther from
the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I
went up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb
being made, I plainly saw the current again as
before, only that it ran farther off, being near half
a league from the shore; whereas in my case, it set
close upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe
along with it, which at another time it would not
have done. . . - - .
This observation convinced me, that I had no-
thing to do but to observe the ebbing and the
flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring
my boat about the island again: but when I began
to think of putting it in practice, I had such a ter-
ror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the dan-
VOL. I. P
ger I had been in, that I could not think of it again
with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took
up another resolution, which was more safe, though
more laborious; and this was, that I would build,
or rather make me another periagua, or canoe; and
so have one for one side of the island, and one for
the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under
the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments, or
caves, one within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had a door yet be-
yond my wall or fortification, that is to say, be-
yond where my wall joined to the rock, was all
filled up with large earthen pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen
great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels
each, where I laid up my stores of provision, espe-
cially my corn, some in the ear cut off short from
the straw, and the other rubbed out with my
hands.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much,
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's
view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my
two pieces of corn ground; which I kept duly
cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me
their harvest in its season: and whenever I had
occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining
as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also ; for first, I
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept
in repair; that is to say, I kept the hedge which
circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the inside; I
kept the trees, which at first were no more than
my stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall;
I kept them always so cut, that they might spread
and grow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always
standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles
set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me a squab or couch, with the skins of the
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things,
and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to
our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up
my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the goats should break through, that I never
P 2
left off, till with infinite labour I had stuck the out-
side of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near
to one another, that it was rather a pale than an
hedge, and there was scarce room to put an hand
through between them, which afterwards, when
those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy
season, made the enclosure strong, like a wall, in-
deed stronger than any wall. .
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support;
for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame
creatures thus at my hand, would be a living maga-
zine of flesh, milk, butter and cheese, for me, as
long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty
years; and that keeping them in my reach, de-
pended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures
to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping
them together; which by this method indeed I so
effectually secured, that when these little stakes
began to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I
was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not only
agreeable, but physical, wholesome, nourishing,
and refreshing to the last degree. -
As this was also about half way between my
other habitation and the place where I had laid up
my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert
myself, but no more hazardous voyages would Igo,
nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out
of my knowledge again by the currents, or winds,
or any other accident. But now I come to a new
scene of my life. -
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the
print of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which
was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition.
I listened, I looked round me, I could hear nothing,
nor see anything; I went up to a rising ground to
look farther. I went up the shore, and down the
shore, but it was all one, I could see no other im-
pression but that one. I went to it again to see if
there were any more, and to observe if it might not
be my fancy, but there was no room for that, for
there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel,
and every part of a foot: how it came thither I
knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But
after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man
perfectly confused, and out of myself, I came home
to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground
I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking
behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking
every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at
P 3
a distance to be a man; nor is it possible to de-
scribe how many various shapes an affrighted ima-
gination represented things to me in ; how many
wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came
into my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued;
whether I went over by the ladder, as first contriv.
ed, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I
called a door, I cannot remember; for never
frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with
more terror of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night: the farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and
reason joined in with me upon this supposition.
For how should any other thing in human shape
come into the place 2 Where was the vessel that
brought them 2 What marks were there of any
other footsteps? And how was it possible a man
should come there 2 But then to think that Satan
should take human shape upcn him in such a place,
where there could be no manner of occasion for it,
but to leave the print of his foot behind him, and
that even for no purpose too (for he could not be
sure I should see it), this was an amazement the
other way. I considered that the devil might have
found out abundance of other ways to have ter-
rified me, than this of the single print of a foot.
That as I lived quite on the other side of the island,
he would never have been so simple to leave a
mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one
whether I should ever see it or not ; and in the
sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon an
high wind would have defaced entirely. All this
seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with
all notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of
the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to
argue me out of all apprehensions of its being the
devil. And I presently concluded that it must be
some more dangerous creature; viz. That it must
be some of the savages of the main land over against
me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes,
and, either driven by the currents, or by contrary
winds, had made the island; and had been on shore,
but were gone away again to sea, being as loth,
perhaps, to have staid in this desolate island, as I
would have been to have had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thought, that I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not see my boat, by which they
would have concluded, that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched far-
P 4
ther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my
imaginations about their having found my boat,
and that there were people here; and that if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen
so that they should not find me, yet they would
find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away
all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at
last for mere want. -
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope: all
that former confidence in GoD which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of
his goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed
me by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
power the provision which he had made for me by
his goodness. I reproached myself with my uneasi-
ness, that I would not sow any more corn one year,
than would just serve me till the next season, as if
no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying
the crop that was upon the ground. And this I
thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
future to have two or three years corn before-hand,
so that whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread. -
How strange a chequer-work of Providence is
the life of man And by what secret differing
springs are the affections hurried about, as differ-
ing circumstances present! To-day we love what
to-morrow we hate; to-day we seek what to-mor-
row we shun ; to-day we desire what to-morrow we
fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of
This was exemplified in me at this time, in the most
lively manner imaginable; for I, whose only afflic-
tion was, that I seemed banished from human
society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and con-
demned to what I call a silent life; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
bered among the living, or to appear among the
rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of my
own species, could have seemed to me a raising me
from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of sal-
vation, could bestow; I say, that I should now
tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground, at but the
shadow, or silent appearance of a man's having set
his foot on the island
Such is the uneven state of human life; and it
afforded me a great many curious speculations
afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first
surprise. I considered that this was the station of
life the infinitely wise and good providence of GoD
had determined for me; that as I could not fore-
see what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all
this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty, who,
as I was his creature, had an undoubted right, by
creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely
as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature
who had offended him, had likewise a judicial
right to condemn me to what punishment he
thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to
bear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him.
I then reflected that GoD, who was not only
righteous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit
thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to de-
liver me; that if he did not think fit to do it, it
was my unquestioned duty to resign myself abso-
lutely and entirely to his will. And, on the other
hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to
him, and quietly to attend the dictates and direc-
tions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days,
nay, I may say, weeks and months; and one par-
ticular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I
cannot omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my
bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of Savages, I found it discomposed
me very much; upon which those words of the
scripture came into my thoughts, “Call upon me
in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.”
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earnestly to GoD for deli-
verance. When I had done praying, I took up my
bible, and opening it to read, the first words that
presented to me, were, “Wait on the Lord, and be
of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart:
wait, I say, on the Lord.” It is impossible to ex-
press the comfort this gave me; and in return, I
thankfully laid down the book, and was no more
sad; at least, not on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehen-
sions, and reflections, it came into my thoughts
one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of
my own, and that this foot might be the print of
my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat.
This cheered me up a little too, and I began to
persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was
nothing else but my own foot; and why might not
I come that way from the boat as well as I was
going that way to the boat? Again, I considered
also, that I could by no means tell for certain
where I had trod, and where I had not; and that,
if at last this was only the print of my own foot,
I had played the part of those fools, who strive to
make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then
are themselves frighted at them more than any
body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep
abroad again; for I had not stirred out of my
castle for three days and nights, so that I began to
starve for provision; for I had little or nothing
within doors, but some barley-cakes and water.
Then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked
too, which usually was my evening diversion; and
the poor creatures were in great pain and incon-
venience for want of it; and indeed it almost
spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their
milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief,
that this was nothing but the print of one of my
own feet, (and so I might be truly said to start at
my own shadow,) I began to go abroad again, and
went to my country-house to milk my flock; but
to see with what fear I went forward, how often I
looked behind me, how I was ready, every now-
and-then, to lay down my basket, and run for my
life; it would have made any one have thought I
was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed
I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a
little bolder, and to think there was really nothing
in it but my own imagination; but I could not per-
suade myself fully of this, till I should go down
to the shore again, and see this print of a foot,
and measure it by my own, and see if there was
any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured
it was my own foot. But when I came to the
place first, it appeared evidently to me, that when
I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore
any where thereabouts. Secondly, when I came
to measure the mark with my own foot, I found
my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these
things filled my head with new imaginations, and
gave me the vapours again to the highest degree;
so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and
I went home again, filled with the belief that some
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited, and I might be sur-
prised before I was aware; and what course to take
for my security, I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of
those means which reason offers for their relief.
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw
down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not find
them, and then frequent the island in prospect of
the same, or the like booty; then to the simple thing
of digging up my two corn-fields, that they might
not find such a grain there, and still to be prompted
to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower
and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of
my habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in
order to find out the persons inhabiting. º
These were the subjects of the first night's cogi-
tation, after I was come home again, while the ap-
prehensions which had so over-run my mind were
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours,
as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand
times more terrifying than danger itself, when ap-
parent to the eyes; and we find the burden of
anxiety greater by much than the evil which we
are anxious about; but, which was worse than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the
resignation I used to practise that I hoped to have.
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained
not only, that the Philistines were upon him, but
that GoD had forsaken him; for I did not now
take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to
GoD in my distress, and resting upon his provi-
dence, as I had done before, for my defence and
deliverance; which if I had done, I had at least
been more cheerfully supported under this new
surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more
resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking
all night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and
having by the amusement of my mind been, as it
were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very
soundly, and awaked much better composed than
I had ever been before. And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with my-
self, I concluded, that this island, which was so
exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from
the main land than as I had seen, was not so en-
tirely abandoned as I might imagine. That al-
though there were no stated inhabitants who lived
on the spot; yet that there might sometimes come
boats off from the shore, who either with design, or
perhaps never but when they were driven by cross
winds, might come to this place.
That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had
not met with the least shadow or figure of any
people before; and that if at any time they should
be driven here, it was probable they went away
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had
never thought fit to fix there upon any occasion, to
this time.
That the most I could suggest any danger from,
was, from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against
their wills; so they made no stay here, but went
off again with all possible speed, seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help
of the tides and day-light back again; and that
therefore I had nothing to do but to consider of
some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages
land upon the spot. -
Now I begun sorely to repent that I had dug
my cave so large, as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me
a second fortification, in the manner of a semi-
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had
planted a double row of trees about twelve years
before, of which I made mention: these trees hav-
ing been planted so thick before, there wanted but
a few piles to be driven between them, that they
should be thicker and stronger, and my wall would
be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old
cables, and every thing I could think of to make
it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as
big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside
of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick,
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and
laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to
plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I
got seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say,
I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into
frames that held them like a carriage, that so I
could fire all the seven guns in two minutes time:
this wall I was many a weary month in finishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground
without my wall, for a great way every way, as
full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,
which I found so apt to grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large
space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer wall. - -
Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and
in five or six years time I had a wood before my
dwelling, grown so monstrous thick and strong,
that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no
man of what kind soever would ever imagine that
there was any thing beyond it, much less an habi-
tation : as for the way I proposed myself to go in
and out (for I left no avenue) it was by setting
two ladders; one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, and left room to place an-
other ladder upon that; so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living could come down
to me without mischiefing himself; and if they had
come down, they were still on the outside of m
outer wall. - -
Thus I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation; and it will
be seen at length, that they were not altogether
without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at
that time more than my mere fear suggested.
While this was doing, I was not altogether care.
less of my other affairs; for I had a great concern
upon me for my little herd of goats; they were not
only a present supply to me upon every occasion,
and began to be sufficient for me, without the ex-
pence of powder and shot, but also abated the
fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones; and I
was loth to lose the advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them: one was
to find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half
a dozen young goats in each place; so that if any
disaster happened to the flock in general, I might
be able to raise them again with little trouble and
time: and this, though it would require a great
deal of time and labour, I thought was the most
rational design. . . .
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched
upon one, which was as private indeed as my heart
could wish; for it was a little damp piece of ground
in the middle of the hollow and thick woods,
VOL. I. Q
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once
before, endeavouring to come back that way from
the eastern part of the island: here I found a clear
piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with
woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature;
at least it did not want near so much labour to
make it so, as the other pieces of ground I had
worked so hard at. -
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground, and in less than a month’s time I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So without any farther delay, I
removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to this
piece; and when there, I continued to perfect the
fence, till I had made it as secure as the other,
which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took
me up more time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expence of, purely
from my apprehensions on the account of the
print of a man's foot which I had seen; for as yet,
I never saw any human creature come near the
island; and I had now lived two years under these
uneasinesses, which indeed made my life much
less comfortable than it was before; as may well
be imagined, by any who know what it is to
live in the constant snare of the fear of man : and
this I must observe with grief too, that the dis-
composure of my mind had too great impressions
also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for
the dread and terror of falling into the hands of
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I
seldom found myself in a due temper for applica-
tion to my Maker; at least, not with the sedate
calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont
to do. I rather prayed to GoD as under great
affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with
danger, and in expectation every night of being
murdered and devoured before the morning; and I
must testify from my experience, that a temper of
peace, thankfulness, love and affection, is much
more the proper frame for prayer than that of ter-
ror and discomposure; and that under the dread of
mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a
comforting performance of the duty of praying to
GoD, than he is for repentance on a sick-bed; for
these discomposures affect the mind as the others do
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must
necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body,
and much greater, praying to GoD being properly
an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on; after I had thus secured one part
of my little living stock, I went about the whole
island, searching for another private place, to make
such another deposit; when wandering more to the
west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon
the sea at a great distance. I had found a per-
spective glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests,
which I saved out of our ship; but I had it not
about me; and this was so remote, that I could
Q 2
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it
till my eyes were not able to look any longer: whe-
ther it was a boat, or not, I do not know; but as I
descended from the hill, I could see no more of it, so
I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more with-
out a perspective glass in my pocket. :
When I was come down the hill, to the end of
the island, where indeed I had never been before,
I was presently convinced, that the seeing the
print of a man's foot, was not such a strange thing
in the island as I imagined; and, but that it was a
special Providence that I was cast upon the side
of the island where the savages never came, I
should easily have known, that nothing was more
frequent than for the canoes from the main, when
they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to
shoot over to that side of the island for harbour;
likewise, as they often met and fought in their
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, ac-
cording to their dreadful customs, being all can-
nibals, they would kill and eat them : of which
hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as
I said above, being the S. W. point of the island,
I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind,
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet,
and other bones of human bodies; and particularly
I observed a place where there had been a fire
made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit,
where it is supposed the savage wretches had sat
down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of
their fellow-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these
things, that I entertained no notions of any dan-
ger to myself from it for a long while ; all my ap-
prehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a
pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror
of the degeneracy of human nature; which, though
I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a
view of before : in short, I turned away my face
from the horrid spectacle, my stomach grew sick,
and I was just at the point of fainting, when na-
ture discharged the disorder from my stomach,
and, having vomited with an uncommon violence,
I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in
the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again
with all the speed I could, and walked on towards
my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the
island, I stood still awhile as amazed; and then
recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost af.
fection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my
eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in
a part of the world where I was distinguished from
such dreadful creatures as these ; and that though
I had esteemed my present condition very mise-
rable, had yet given me so many comforts in it, that
I had still more to give thanks for than to com-
plain of; and this above all, that I had, even in
this miserable condition, been comforted with the
Q 3
knowledge of himself, and the hope of his blessing,
which was a felicity more than sufficiently equi-
valent to all the misery which I had suffered or
could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to
my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to
the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was
before; for I observed, that these wretches never
came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not ex-
pecting any thing here; and having often, no
doubt, been up in the covered woody part of it,
without finding any thing to their purpose. I
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footsteps of a human crea-
ture there before; and might be here eighteen
more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did
not discover myself to them, which I had no man-
ner of occasion to do, it being my only business to
keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the sa-
vage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of
the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring
and eating one another up, that I continued pensive
and sad, and kept close within my own circle for
almost two years after this: when I say my own
circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz. my
castle, my country-seat, which I called my bower,
and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I look after
this for any other use than as an enclosure for my
goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to
these hellish wretches was such, that I was as fear-
ful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself;
nor did I so much as go to look after my boat in
all this time, but began rather to think of making
me another; for I could not think of ever making
any more attempts to bring the other boat round the
island to me, lest I should meet with some of those
creatures at sea, in which, if I had happened to
have fallen into their hands, I knew what would
have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that
I was in no danger of being discovered by these
people, began to wear off my uneasiness about
them ; and I began to live just in the same com-
posed manner as before; only with this difference,
that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more
about me than I did before, lest I should happen
to be seen by any of them ; and particularly, I
was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of
them on the island should happen to hear it; and
it was therefore a very good providence to me,
that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of
goats, that I had no need to hunt any more about
the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch
any more of them after this, it was with traps and
snares, as I had done before : so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it; and, which
was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the
Q 4
ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least
two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt.
I likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses
that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to
put it in also ; so that I was now a most formida-
ble fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you
add to the former description of myself, the par-
ticular of two pistols, and a great broad-sword
hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scab-
bard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re-
duced to my former calm sedate way of living;
all these things tended to shew me more and more
how far my condition was from being miserable,
compared to some others; nay, to many other par-
ticulars of life, which it might have pleased God
to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting,
how little repining there would be among man-
kind, at any condition of life, if people would ra.
ther compare their condition with those that are
worse, in order to be thankful, than be always
comparing them with those which are better, to
assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my
own preservation, had taken off the edge of my
invention for my own conveniences; and I had
dropt a good design, which I had once bent my
thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I could not
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer: this was really a whim-
sical thought, and I reproved myself often for the
simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be
the want of several things necessary to the making
my beer, that it would be impossible for me to sup-
ply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was
a thing that, as I have observed already, I could
never compass; no, though I spent not many days,
but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to
no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to
make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper
or kettle to make it boil; and yet, had not all
these things intervened, I mean the frights and
terrors I was in about the savages, I had under-
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I
seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing
it, when I once had it in my head enough to begin
it. -
But my invention now ran quite another way;
for night and day I could think of nothing but
how I might destroy some of these monsters in
their cruel bloody entertainment, and if possible,
save the victim they should bring hither to destroy.
It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be, to set down all the con-
trivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at
least frightening them, so as to prevent their com-
ing hither any more; but all was abortive; nothing
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be
there to do it myself; and what could one man
do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts,
or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun ?
Sometimes I contrived to dig an hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five
or six pounds of gunpowder, which when they
kindled their fire, would consequently take fire,
and blow up all that was near it; but, as in the
first place I should be very loth to waste so much
powder upon them, my store being now within the
quantity of a barrel, so neither could I be sure of
its going off at any certain time, when it might
surprise them ; and, at best, that it would do little
more than just blow the fire about their ears, and
fright them, but not sufficient to make them for-
sake the place; so I laid it aside, and then pro-
posed, that I would place myself in ambush, in
some convenient place, with my three guns all
double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody
ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure
to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every
shot; and then falling in upon them with my three
pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that,
if there were twenty, I should kill them all : this
fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I
was so full of it that I often dreamt of it; and
sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them
in my sleep.
I went so far with it in my indignation, that I
employed myself several days to find out proper
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to
watch for them; and I went frequently to the
place itself, which was now grown more familiar
to me; and especially while my mind was thus
filled with thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody
putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as
I may call it; but the horror I had at the place,
and at the signals of the barbarous wretches de-
vouring one another, abated my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of
the hill, where I was satisfied I might securely
wait till I saw any of the boats coming, and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on
shore, convey myself unseen into thickets of trees,
in one of which there was an hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely; and where I might sit,
and observe all their bloody doings, and take my
full aim at their heads, when they were so close
together, as that it would be next to impossible
that I should miss my shoot, or that I could fail
wounding three or four of them at the first shoot.
In this place then I resolved to fix my design;
and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my
ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded
with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets, and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near an handful of
swan-shot of the largest size; I also loaded my
pistols with about four bullets each ; and in this
posture, well provided with ammunition for a
second and third charge, I prepared myself for my
expedition.
. After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and in my imagination put it in practice, I conti-
nually made my tour every morning up to the top
of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called
it, about three miles or more, to see if I could ob-
serve any boats upon the sea, coming near the
island, or standing over towards it; but I began
to tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or
three months constantly kept my watch; but came
always back without any discovery, there having
not in all that time been the least appearance, not
only on or near the shore, but not on the whole
ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
every way. - * * * * . " , , , ;
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while
in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution,
as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for
an offence, which I had not at all entered into a
discussion of in my thoughts, any further than my
passions were at first fired by the horror I con-
ceived at the unnatural custom of the people of
that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by
Providence, in his wise disposition of the world,
to have no other guide than that of their own abo-
minable and vitiated passions; and consequently
were left, and perhaps had been for some ages, to
act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful
cusoms, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned
of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degene-
racy, could have run them into; but now, when,
as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless
excursion which I had made so long, and so far,
every morning in vain; so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter, and I began, with
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it
was I was going to engage in ; what authority or
call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner
upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had
thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished,
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners
of his judgments upon one another; also, how far
these people were offenders against me, and what
OF, ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237
which they shed promiscuously one upon another.
I debated this very often with myself thus : How
do I know what God himself judges in this parti-
cular case ? It is certain these people do not com-
mit this as a crime; it is not against their own
consciences reproving, or their light reproaching
them. They do not know it to be an offence, and
then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we
do in almost all the sins we commit. They think
it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war,
than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat hnman flesh,
than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong in
it; that these people were not murderers in the
sense that I had before condemned them in my
thoughts, any more than those Christians were
murderers, who often put to death the prisoners
taken in battle, or more frequently, upon many
occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword,
without giving quarter, though they threw down
their arms and submitted.
In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit
the usage they gave one another was thus brutish
and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me:
these people had done me no injury: that if they
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my imme-
diate preservation to fall upon them, something
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of
their power, and they had really no knowledge of
me, and consequently no design upon me; and
therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon
them : that this would justify the conduct of
the Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in
America, where they destroyed millions of these
people, who, however they were idolaters and bar-
barians, and had several bloody and barbarous
rites in these customs, such as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent people; and that the rooting them
out of the country is spoken of with the utmost
abhorrence and detestation, even by the Spaniards
themselves, at this time, and by all other Christian
nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody
and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either
to GoD or man ; and such, as for which the very
name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and
terrible to all people of humanity, or of Christian
compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were par.
ticularly eminent for the product of a race of men,
who were without principles of tenderness, or the
common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is
reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in
the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause,
and to a kind of a full stop ; and I began by little
and little to be off of my design, and to conclude
I had taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to
attack the savages; that it was not my business
to meddle with them, unless they first attacked
me, and this it was my business, if possible, to pre-
vent; but that, if I were discovered and attacked,
then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that
this really was the way, not to deliver myself, but
entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I
was sure to kill every one that not only should be
on shore at that time, but that should ever come
on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped
to tell their country-people what had happened,
they would come over again by thousands to re-
venge the death of their fellows; and I should
only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in
principles nor in policy, I ought one way or other
to concern myself in this affair: that my business
was by all possible means to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to
guess by, that there were any living creatures upon
the island, I mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I
was convinced now many ways that I was perfectly
out of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures,
I mean innocent as to me; as to the crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them; they were national punishments
to make a just retribution for national offences;
and to bring public judgments upon those who
offend in a public manner, by such ways as best
please GoD.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me, than that I had
not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw
so much reason to believe would have been no less
... a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had com.
mitted it; and I gave most humble thanks on my
knees to GoD, that had thus delivered me from
blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the
protection of his Providence, that I might not fall
into the hands of barbarians; or that I might not
lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more
clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my
own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this: and so far was I from desiring an occa-
sion for falling upon these wretches, that in all
that time I never once went up the hill to see
whether there were any of them in sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on shore
there or not; that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my contrivances against them, or be
provoked, by any advantage which might present
itself, to fall upon them; only this I did, I went
and removed my boat, which I had on the other
side of the island, and carried it down to the east
end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little
cove which I found under some high rocks, and
where I knew, by reason of the currents, the sa-
vages durst not, at least would not, come with
their boats, upon any account whatsoever.
With my boat I carried away every thing that
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne-
cessary for the bare going thither; viz. a mast
and sail, which I had made for her, and a thing
like an anchor, but indeed, which could not be
called either anchor or grappling: however, it was
the best I could make of its kind. All these I re-
moved, that there might not be the least shadow
of any discovery, or any appearance of any boat,
or of any habitation upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re-
tired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my constant employment, viz. to
milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in
the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part
of the island, was quite out of danger: for certain
VOL. I. R
it is, that these savage people, who sometimes
haunted this island, never came with any thoughts
of finding any thing here, and consequently never
wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but
they might have been several times on shore, after
my apprehensions of them had made me cautious,
as well as before; and indeed I looked back with
some horror upon the thoughts of what my condi-
tion would have been, if I had chopped upon them,
and been discovered before that, when naked and
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded
often only with small shot. I walked every where
peeping and peering about the island, to see what
I could get: what a surprise should I have been
in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot,
I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages,
and found them pursuing me, and, by the swift-
ness of their running, no possibility of my escap-
ing them!
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much,
that I could not soon recover it; to think what I
should have done, and how I not only should not
have been able to resist them, but even should not
have had presence of mind enough to do what I
might have done ; much less what now, after so
much consideration and preparation, I might be
able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of
these things, I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great while; but I re-
solved it at last all into thankfulness to that Pro-

vidence which had delivered me from so many un-
seen dangers, and had kept me from those mis-
chiefs, which I could no way have been the agent
in delivering myself from ; because I had not the
least notion of any such thing depending, or the
least supposition of its being possible. -
This renewed a contemplation, which often had
come to my thoughts in former time, when first I
began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven,
in the dangers we run through in this life; how
wonderfully we are delivered when we know no-
thing of it: how, when we are in a quandary (as
we call it), a doubt or hesitation, whether to go
this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us
this way, when we intended to go another way;
nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps
business, has called to go the other way, yet a
strange impression upon the mind, from we know
not what springs, and by we know not what power,
shall over-rule us to go this way; and it shall af.
terwards appear, that had we gone that way which
we would have gone, and even to our imagination
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined
and lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I
afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that
whenever I found those secret hints, or pressings
of my mind, to doing or not doing any thing that
presented, or to going this way or that way, I
never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I
knew no other reason for it, than that such a pres-
R 2
sure, or such an hint, hung upon my mind. I
could give many examples of the success of this
conduct in the course of my life; but more espe-
cially in the latter part of my inhabiting this un-
happy island; besides many occasions which it is
very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had
seen with the same eyes then that I saw with now.
But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot
but advise all considering men, whose lives are at-
tended with such extraordinary incidents as mine,
or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight
such secret intimations of Providence, let them
come from what invisible intelligence they will.
That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot ac-
count for; but certainly they are a proof of the
converse of spirits, and the secret communication
between those embodied and those unembodied;
and such a proof as can never be withstood; of
which I shall have occasion to give some very re-
markable instances, in the remainder of my soli-
tary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange, if I confess that these anxieties, these
constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that
was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and
to all the contrivances that I had laid for my fu-
ture accommodations and conveniences. I had
the care of my safety more now upon my hands
than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail,
or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I
should make should be heard; much less would I
fire a gun, for the same reason; and above all, I
was very, uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the
day, should betray me: and for this reason I re-
moved that part of my business which required
fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into
my new apartment in the wood; where, after I
had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable
consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth,
which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say,
no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would
be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would any
man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so
much as a safe retreat. -
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of
a great rock, where by mere accident (I would
say, if I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe
all such things now to Providence), I was cut-
ting down some thick branches of trees to make
charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe the
reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habi-
tation, as I said before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my bread, cooking my meat,
&c. so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I
had seen done in England, under turf, till it became
chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out,
I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform
the other services which fire was wanting for at
home, without any danger of smoke. -
But this by the bye. While I was cutting down
R 3
some wood here, I perceived that behind a very
thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there
was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to look
into it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth
of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say,
sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and per-
haps another with me; but I must confess to you,
I made more haste out than I did in ; when look-
ing farther into the place, which was perfectly
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some crea-
ture, whether devil or man I knew not, which
twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the
cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the
reflection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone,
and that I durst to believe there was nothing in
this cave that was more frightful than myself:
upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a
large firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three
steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as
I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like
that of a man in some pain; and it was followed
by a broken noise, as if of words half-expressed,
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put
me into a cold sweat; and if I had had an hat on
my head, I will not answer for it that my hair
?

might not have lifted it off. But still, plucking
up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging
myself a little, with considering that the power
and presence of GoD was every-where, and was
able to protect me; upon this I stepped forward
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it
up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground
a most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making
his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying
indeed of mere old age. -
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out,
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and I thought with myself, he might even
lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there, while he
had any life in him. * º
I was now recovered from my surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the cave was
but very small; that is to say, it might be about
twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, either
round or square, no hands ever having been em-
ployed in making it but those of mere nature. I
observed also, that there was a place at the farther
side of it that went in farther, but so low, that it
required me to creep upon my hands and knees
to get into it, and whither it went, I knew not ; so
having no candle, I gave it over for some time,
but resolved to come again the next day, provided
with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made
of the lock of one of the musquets, with some wild-
fire in the pan.
R 4
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided
with six large candles of my own making (for I
made very good candles now of goats tallow); and
going into this low place, I was obliged to creep
upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards;
which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold
enough, considering that I knew not how far it
might go, or what was beyond it. When I was
got through the streight, I found the roof rose
higher up, I believe nea, twenty feet; but never
was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare
say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of
this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred
thousand lights to me from my two candles: what
it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other
precious stones, or gold, which I rather suppose it
to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and
had a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that
there was no nauseous creature to be seen; nei-
ther was there any damp or wet on the sides of
the roof; the only difficulty in it was the en-
trance, which, however, as it was a place of secu-
rity, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought
that was a convenience; so that I was really re-
joiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any
delay, to bring some of those things which I was
most anxious about to this place; particularly, I
resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder,
and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces (for
I had three in all) and three musquets (for of them
I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle only five,
which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon,
on my outmost fence, and were ready also to take
out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which
I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet;
and I found that the water had penetrated about
three or four inches into the powder on every side,
which, caking and growing hard, had preserved
the inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had
near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre
of the cask; and this was an agreeable discovery
to me at that time; so I carried all away thither,
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder
with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any
kind. I also carried thither all the lead I had left
for the bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient
giants, which were said to live in caves and holes in
the rock, where none could come at them; for I
persuaded myself while I was here, if five hundred
savages were to hunt me, they could never find me
out; or if they did, they would not venture to
attack me here. -
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in
the mouth of the cave the next day after I made
this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig
a great hole there, and throw him in, and cover him
with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him
there, to prevent offence to my nose. -
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence
in this island, and was so naturalized to the place,
and to the manner of living, that could I have but
enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come
to the place to disturb me, I could have been con-
tent to have capitulated for spending the rest of
my time there, even to the last moment, till I had
laid me down and died, like the old goat in the
cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions
and amusements, which made the time pass more
pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before;
as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before,
to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked
so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant
to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-
twenty years: how long he might live afterwards
I knew not; though I know they have a notion in
the Brasils, that they live an hundred years; per-
haps some of my Polls may be alive there still, call-
ing after poor Robin Crusoe to this day; I wish
no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear
them; but if he did, he would certainly believe it
was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and
loving companion to me for no less than sixteen
years of my time, and then died of mere old age;
as for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed,
to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several
of them at first, to keep them from devouring me
and all I had ; but at length, when the two old ones
I brought with me were gone, and after some time
continually driving them from me, and letting
them have no provision with me, they all ran wild
into the woods, except two or three favourites,
which I kept tame, and whose young, when they
had any, I always drowned, and these were part of
my family. Besides these, I always kept two or
three household kids about me, which I taught to
feed out of my hand; and I had also more parrots
which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin
Crusoe, but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I
take the pains with any of them that I had done
with him. I had also several tame sea fowls, whose
names I know not, which I caught upon the shore,
and cut their wings; and the little stakes, which I
had planted before my castle wall, being now grown
up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived
among these low trees, and bred there, which was
very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I
began to be very well contented with the life I led,
if it might but have been secured from the dread
of savages. - -
But it was otherwise directed; and it might not
be amiss for all people who shall meet with my
story to make this just observation from it, viz.
How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which,
when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us,
is oftentimes the very means or door of our deli-
verance, by which alone we can be raised again
from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give
many examples of this in the course of my unac-
countable life; but in nothing was it more particu-
larly remarkable than in the circumstances of my
last years of solitary residence in this island.
It was now the month of December, as I said
above, in my twenty-third year; and this being the
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was
the particular time of my harvest, and required my
being pretty much abroad in the fields; when
going out pretty early in the morning, even before
it was thorough day-light, I was surprised with
seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a dis-
tance from me of about two miles, towards the
end of the island, where I had observed some sa-
vages had been, as before; but not on the other
side: but to my great affliction, it was on my side
of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go
out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no
more peace within, from the apprehensions I had,
that if these savages, in rambling over the island,
should find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my
works and improvements, they would immediately
conclude that there were people in the place, and
would then never give over till they found me out.
In this extremity I went back directly to my castle,
pulled up the ladder after me, having made all
things without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself
in a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon,
as I called them, that is to say, my musquets,
which were mounted upon my new fortification,
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself
to the last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to re-
commend myself to the divine protection, and ear-
nestly to pray to GoD to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I con-
tinued about two hours, but began to be mighty
impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies
to send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sit-
ting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder
to the side of the hill, where there was a flat
place, as I observed before, and then pulling the
ladder up after me, I set it up again, and mounted
to the top of the hill; and pulling out my perspec-
tive glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me
down flat on my belly on the ground, and began
to look for the place. I presently found there
were no less than nine naked savages sitting round
a small fire they had made; not to warm them,
for they had no need of that, the weather being
extreme hot; but, as I supposed, to dress some of
their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had
brought with them, whether alive or dead I could
not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide
of ebb, they seemed to me to wait the return of
the flood to go away again. It is not easy to ima-
gine what confusion this sight put me into, espe-
cially seeing them come on my side the island, and
so near me too; but when I observed their coming
must be always with the current of the ebb, I be-
gan afterwards to be more sedate in my mind,
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety
all the time of tide of flood, if they were not on
shore before; and having made this observation, I
went abroad about my harvest work with the more
composure. - -
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take
boat, and row (or paddle as we call it) all away.
I should have observed, that for an hour and more
before they went off, they went to dancing, and
I could easily discern their postures and gestures
by my glasses: I could only perceive, by my
nicest observation, that they were stark naked,
and had not the least covering upon them; but
whether they were men or women, that I could
not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard; and with all the speed I was able to
make, I went away to the hill, where I had disco-
vered the first appearance of all. As soon as I got
thither, which was not less than two hours (for
I could not go apace, being so loaded with arms
as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes
more of savages on that place; and looking out
farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making
over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when
going down to the shore, I could see the marks
of horror which the dismal work they had been
about had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones,
and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and
devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight,
that I began now to premeditate the destruction of
the next that I saw there, let them be who or how
many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which
they thus made to this island were not very fre-
quent; for it was above fifteen months before any
more of them came on shore there again; that is
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or sig-
nals of them, in all that time; for as to the rainy
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at
least not so far: yet all this while I lived uncom-
fortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I
was in of their coming upon me by surprise; from
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil, is
more bitter than the suffering, especially if there
is no room to shake off that expectation or those
apprehensions. -
During all this time, I was in the murdering
humour; and took up most of my hours, which
should have been better employed, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them the very
next time I should see them; especially if they
should be divided, as they were the last time, into
two parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I
killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was
still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I
should be at length no less a murderer than they
were in being men-eaters, and perhaps much
II].OTe SO.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day
or other fall into the hands of those merciless
creatures. If I did at any time venture abroad, it
was not without looking around me with the great-
est care and caution imaginable; and now I found,
to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had
provided a tame flock or herd of goats; for I durst
not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially near
that side of the island where they usually came,
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had
fled from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred
canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew
what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months
more before I ever saw any more of the savages,
and then I found them again, as I shall soon ob-
serve. It is true, they might have been there once
or twice, but either they made no stay, or, at least,
I did not hear them; but in the month of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twen-
tieth year, I had a very strange encounter with
them, of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months interval, was very great; I slept
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and
often started out of my sleep in the night: in the
day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and
the reasons why I might justify the doing of it.
But to wave all this for a while, it was the middle
of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as
my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I
marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the
sixteenth of May, that it blew a great storm of
wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and
thunder, and a very foul night was after it. I
know not what was the particular occasion of it:
but as I was reading in the bible, and taken up
with serious thoughts about my present condition,
I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I
thought, fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite dif-
ferent nature from any I had met with before; for
the notions this put into my thoughts were quite
of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste
imaginable; and in a trice clapped up my ladder
to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me, and mounting it the second time, got to the
top of the hill; that very moment a flash of fire
bade me listen for a second gun, which accord-
ingly in about half a moment I heard, and by the
sound knew that it was from that part of the sea
where I was driven out with the current in my boat.
VOL. I. S
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade,
or some other ship in company, and fired these
guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I
had this presence of mind at that minute as to
think, that though I could not help them, it may
be they might help me: so I brought together al
the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a
good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill:
the wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though
the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out,
so that I was certain, if there was any such thing
as a ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they
did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard
another gun, and after that several others, all from
the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long,
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance
at sea, full east of the island; whether a sail or an
hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glasses,
the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently
concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east
side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been
formerly carried away with the current; and get-
ting up there, the weather by this time being per-
fectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sor-
row, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks which I found when
I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a
kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occa-
sion of my recovering then from the most despe-
rate, hopeless condition, that ever I had been in
all my life. -
Thus, what is one man’s safety is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E.
and E. N. E. Had they seen the island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have saved them-
selves on shore by the help of their boat; but the
firing of their guns for help, especially when they
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many
thoughts: first, I imagined, that, upon seeing my
light, they might have put themselves into their
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore;
but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away: other times I imagined, that they
might have lost their boat before, as might be the
case many ways; as particularly, by the breaking
of the sea upon their ship, which many times
obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat;
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their
own hands: other times I imagined, they had
some other ship or ships in company, who, upon
S 2
the signals of distress they had made, had taken
them up, and carried them off: otherwhiles I fan-
cied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and
being hurried away by the current that I had been
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean,
where there was nothing but misery and perishing;
and that perhaps they might by this time think of
starving, and of being in a condition to eat one
another. -
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in
the condition I was in, I could do no more than
look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them; which had still this good effect on my side,
that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to GoD, who had so happily and comfortably pro-
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that
of two ships companies, who were now cast away
upon this part of the world, not one life should be
spared but mine. I learned here again to observe,
that it is very rare that the providence of GoD casts
us into any condition of life so low, or any misery
so great, but we may see something or other to be
thankful for, and may see others in worse circum-
stances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose
any of them were saved; nothing could make it
rational, so much as to wish or expect that they
did not all perish there, except the possibility only
of their being taken up by another ship in com-
pany: and this was but mere possibility indeed ;
for I saw not the least signal or appearance of any
such thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of
words, what a strange longing, or hankering of
desire, I felt in my soul upon this sight; breaking
out sometimes thus: O that there had been but
one or two, nay, but one soul saved out of the ship,
to have escaped to me, that I might but have had
one companion, one fellow-creature to have spoken
to me, and to have conversed with ! In all the time
of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong
a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or
so deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the
affections, which, when they are set a going by
some object in view, or be it some object though
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by
the power of imagination, that motion carries out
the soul by its impetuosity to such violent eager
embracings of the object, that the absence of it is
insupportable. - -
Such were these earnest wishings, That but one
man had been saved O that it had been but one !
I believe I repeated the words, O that it had been
but one a thousand times; and my desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it involun-
tarily; and my teeth in my head would strike toge-
ther, and set againstone another so strong, that for
some time I could not part them again.
S 3
Let the naturalists explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them: all I can say of them
is, to describe the fact, which was ever surprising
to me when I found it, though I knew not from
what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect
of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in
my mind, realizing the comfort which the conver-
sation of one of my fellow-christians would have
been to me.
But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbad it; for till the last year of my being
on this island, I never knew whether any were
saved out of that ship, or no ; and had only the
affliction some days after to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the
island which was next the shipwreck: he had on
no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what na-
tion he was of: he had nothing in his pocket but
two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe ; the last
was to me of ten times more value than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to
venture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubt-
ing but I might find something on board that
might be useful to me; but that did not altoge-
ther press me so much, as the possibility that there
might be yet some living creature on board, whose
life I might not only save, but might, by saving
that life, comfort my own to the last degree: and
this thought clung so to my heart, that I could
not be quiet night nor day, but I must venture out
in my boat on board this wreck; and committing
the rest to God’s providence, I thought the im-
pression was so strong upon my mind, that it could.
not be resisted, that it must come from some invi-
sible direction, and that I should be wanting to my-
self if I did not go. -
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for
fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum
(for I had still a great deal of that left), a basket-
full of raisins: and thus loading myself with every
thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the
water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my
cargo in her, and then went home again for more:
my second cargo was a great bag-full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, an-
other large pot-full of fresh water, and about two
dozen of my small loaves, or barley cakes, more
than before, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a
cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat, I
brought to my boat; and praying to God to direct
my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost
point of the island, on that side, viz. N. E. And
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture, or not to venture; I looked on the
rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides
of the island, at a distance, and which were very
terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard
S 4
I had been in before, and my heart began to fail
me; for I foresaw, that if I was driven into either
of those currents, I should be carried a vast way
out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach or sight of
the island again; and that then, as my boat was but
small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should
be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I
began to give over my enterprise; and having
haled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I
stepped out, and sat me down upon a little spot of
rising ground, very pensive and anxious, between
fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned,
and the flood came on, upon which my going was
for so many hours impracticable: upon this it pre-
sently occurred to me, that I should go up to the
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe,
if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay,
when the flood came in, that I might judge whe-
ther, if I was driven one way out, I might not
expect to be driven another way home, with the
same rapidness of the currents. This thought was
no sooner in my head, but I cast my eyes upon a
little hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was
to guide myselfin my return: here I found, that as
the current of the ebb set out close by the south
point of the island, so the current of the flood set
in close by the shore of the north side; and that I
had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the
island in my return, and I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved
the next morning to set out with the first of the
tide; and reposing myself for that night in the
canoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I
launched out. I made first a little out to sea, full
north, till I began to feel the benefit of the cur-
rent, which set eastward, and which carried me at
a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the
southern-side current had done before, and so as
to take from me all government of the boat; but
having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went,
I say, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and
in less than two hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at; the ship, which
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with, the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
off, but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and
bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a
dog appeared upon her, which, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and as soon as I called him,
jumped into the sea to come to me; and I took
him into the boat, but found him almost dead for
hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread,
and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been
starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave
the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if
I would have let him, he would have burst him-
self. - - -
After this I went on board: the first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about
one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the
sea broke so high, and so continually over her,
that the men were not able to bear it, and were
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water,
as much as if they had been under water; besides
the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that
had life, nor any goods that I could see, but what
were spoiled by the water: there were some casks
of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not,
which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water
being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too
big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which
I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and I
got two of them into the boat without examining
what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the
fore-part broken off, I am persuaded I might have
made a good voyage; for by what I found in these
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a
great deal of wealth on board; and if I may guess
by the course she steered, she must have been
bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la
Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the
Brasils, to the Havanna, in the gulph of Mexico,
and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a
great treasure in her, but of no use at that time to
any body; and what became of the rest of her
people I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into
my boat with much difficulty: there were several
musquets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn,
with about four pounds of powder in it; as for the
musquets, I had no occasion for them, so I left
them, but took the powder-horn; I took a fire-
shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely; as
also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo,
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to
make home again; and the same evening about an
hour within night, I reached the island again,
weary and fatigued to the last degree. .
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in
my new cave, not to carry it home to my castle.
After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on
shore, and began to examine the particulars: the
cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not
such as we had at the Brasils; and, in a word, not
at all good; but when I came to open the chests,
I found several things which I wanted: for exam-
ple, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an ex-
traordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters,
fine, and very good; the bottles held about three
pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found
two pots of very good succades, or sweet-meats,
so fastened also on the top, that the salt water had
not hurt them; and two more of the same, which
the water had spoiled. I found some very good
shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs,
and coloured neckcloths; the former were also
very welcome, being exceeding refreshing, to wipe
my face in an hot day: besides this, when I came to
the till in the chests, I found there three great bags
of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred
pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a
paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars
or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh
near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it,
but of little value; but by the circumstances, it
must have belonged to the gunner's mate, as there
was no powder in it, but about two pounds of
glazed powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose,
for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion.
Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage
that was of much use to me; for as to the money,
I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me
as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given
it for three or four more pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted,
but had not had on my feet now for many years.
I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I
took off the feet of the two drowned men whom
I saw in the wreck; and I found two pair more in
one of the chests, which were very welcome to
me; but they were not like our English shoes, ei-
ther for ease or service, being rather what we call
pumps than shoes. I found in the seamen’s chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold;
I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the
other, which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before
which I brought from our own ship; but it was
great pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship
had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I
might have loaded my canoe several times over
with money, which, if I had ever escaped to Eng.
land, would have lain here safe enough till I
might have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all mythings on shore, and
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour,
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to my old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family
affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much ; and
if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was
pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and
where I could go without so many precautions,
and such a load of arms and ammunition, as
270 -
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I always carried with me, if I went the other
way.
I lived in this condition near two years more ;
but my unlucky head, that was always to let me
know it was born to make my body miserable, was
all these two years filled with projects and designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from
this island; for sometimes I was for making ano-
ther voyage to the wreck, though my reason told
me, that there was nothing left there worth the
hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one
way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew
not-whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
of those who are touched with that general plague
of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half
of their miseries flow; I mean, that of not being
satisfied with the station wherein GoD and nature
hath placed them; for, not to look back upon my
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my
father, the opposition to which was, as I may call
it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the
same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence,
which so happily had seated me at the Brasils as a
planter, blessed me with confined desires, and
could I have been contented to have gone on gra-
dually, I might have been by this time, I mean
in the time of my being on this island, one of the
most considerable planters in the Brasils; nay, I
am persuaded, that by the improvement I had
made in that little time I lived there, and the in-
crease I should probably have made if I had staid,
I might have been worth an hundred thousand
moidores; and what business had I to leave a set-
tled fortune, well-stocked plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea, to
fetch Negroes, when patience and time would so
have increased our stock at home, that we could
have bought them at our own doors, from those
whose business it was to fetch them 2 And though
it had cost us something more, yet the difference
of that price was by no means worth saving at so
great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought ex-
perience of time; and so it was with me now; and
yet, so deep had the mistake taken root in my
temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the means
and possibility of my escape from this place; and
that I may, with the greater pleasure to the
reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it
may not be improper to give some account of my
first conceptions on the subject of this foolish
scheme for my escape; and how and upon what
foundation I acted.
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my fri-
gate laid up, and secured under water as usual, and
my condition restored to what it was before. I
had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but
was not at all the richer; for I had no more use
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spa-
niards came thither. -
It was one of the nights in the rainy season in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first
setting foot in this island of solitariness, I was ly-
ing in my bed or hammock, awake, and very well
in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness
of body, no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than
ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes,
that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all night
long, otherwise than as follows:
It is as impossible as needless to set down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled
through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the
memory, in this night's time. I ran over the
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridg-
ment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island;
and also of that part of my life since I came to
this island. In my reflections upon the state of
my case, since I came on shore on this island, I
was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in
the first year of my habitation here, to that
course of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had
lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot
in the sand; not that I did not believe the savages
had frequented the island even all the while, and
might have been several hundreds of them at times
on the shore there; but as I had never known it,
and was incapable of any apprehensions about it,
my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was
the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my
danger, as if I had never really been exposed to it;
this furnished my thoughts with many very pro-
fitable reflections, and particularly this one: How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has set-
tled in its government of mankind such narrow
bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and
though he walks in the midst of so many thousand
dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him,
would distract his mind, and sink his spirits, he is
kept serene and calm, by having the event of
things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of
the dangers which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time enter-
tained me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real
danger I had been in for so many years in this very
island; and how I had walked about in the great-
est security and with all possible tranquillity, even
perhaps when nothing but a brow on a hill, a
great tree, or the casual approach of night, had
been between me and the worst kind of destruc-
tion, viz. that of falling into the hands of canni-
bals and savages, who would have seized on me
with the same view as I did on a goat or a turtle,
and have thought it no more a crime to kill and
devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a curlew ; I
should unjustly slander myself, if I should say I
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver,
VOL. I. T
to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with
great humility, that all these unknown deliverances
were due, and without which I should inevitably
have fallen into their merciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was
for some time taken up in considering the nature
of these wretched creatures, I mean, the savages;
and how it came to pass in the world, that the
wise Governor of all things should give up any of
his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to some-
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to
devour its own kind : but as this ended in some
(at that time fruitless) speculations, it occurred to
me to inquire what part of the world these
wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from
whence they came; what they ventured so far
from home for; what kind of boats they had ; and
why I might not order myself, and my business
so, that I might be as able to go over thither as
they were to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider,
what I should do with myself when I came thi-
ther; what should become of me if I fell into the
hands of the savages; or how I should escape from
them, if they attempted me; no, nor so much as
how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and
not be attacked by some or other of them, without
any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should
not fall into their hands, what I should do for pro-
vision, or whither I should bend my course; none
of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my
way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the
notion of my passing over in my boat to the main
land. I looked back upon my present condition as
the most miserable that could possibly be; that I
was not able to throw myself into any thing but
death, that could be called worse; that if I reached
the shore of the main, I might, perhaps, meet with
relief; or I might coast along, as I did on the
shore of Africa, till I came to some inhabited
country, and where I might find some relief; and
after all, perhaps, I might fall in with some Chris-
tian ship that might take me in ; and if the worst
came to the worst, I could but die, which would
put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray,
note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an
impatient temper, made, as it were, desperate by
the long continuance of my troubles, and the dis-
appointments I had met in the wreck I had been
on board of, and where I had been so near the ob-
taining of what I so earnestly longed for, viz.
somebody to speak to, and to learn some know-
ledge from of the place where I was, and of the
probable means of my deliverance: I say, I was
agitated wholly by these thoughts. All my calm
of mind in my resignation to Providence, and
waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven,
seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were, no
power to turn my thoughts to any thing but the
project of a voyage to the main; which came upon
me with such force, and such an impetuosity of
desire, that it was not to be resisted.
T 2
When this had agitated my thoughts for two
hours or more, with such violence that it set my
very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as
high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, na-
ture, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with
the very thought of it, threw me into a sound
sleep : one would have thought I should have
dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any thing re-
lating to it; but I dreamed that as I was going
out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw
upon the shore two canoes, and eleven savages
coming to land, and that they brought with them
another savage, whom they were going to kill, in
order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage
that they were going to kill, jumped away, and
ran for his life; then I thought in my sleep, that
he came running into my little thick grove, before
my fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing
him alone, and not perceiving that the others
sought him that way, shewed myself to him, and
smiling upon him, encouraged him, that he kneeled
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him;
upon which I shewed my ladder, made him go up
it, and carried him into my cave, and he became
my servant; and that as soon as I had got this
man, I said to myself, Now I may certainly ven-
ture to the main land; for this fellow will serve
me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and
whither to go for provisions, and whither not to
go for fear of being devoured; what places to ven-
ture into, and what to escape. I waked with this
thought, and was under such inexpressible impres-
sions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my
dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon
coming to myself, and finding it was no more than
a dream, were equally extravagant the other way,
and threw me into a very great dejection of spirit. .
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion,
that my only way to go about an attempt for an
escape, was, if possible, to get a savage in my pos-
session; and, if possible, it should be one of their
prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should bring hither to kill; but these thoughts
still were attended with this difficulty, that it was
impossible to effect this without attacking a whole
caravan of them, and killing them all; and this
was not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly
scrupled the lawfulness of it to me, and my heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much
blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need
not repeat the arguments which occurred to me
against this, they being the same mentioned before:
but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz.
that those men were enemies to my life, and would
devour me, if they could; that it was self-preser-
yation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself
from this death of life, and was acting in my own
defence, as much as if they were actually assault-
ing me, and the like; I say, though these things
argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human
T 3
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me,
and such as I could by no means reconcile myself
to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes
with myself, and after great perplexities about it
(for all these arguments, one way and another,
struggled in my head a long time), the eager pre-
vailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all
the rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get one of
these savages into my hands, cost what it would :
the next thing then was to contrive how to do it;
and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on: but
as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I
resolved to put myself upon the watch to see them
when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the
event, taking such measures as the opportunity
should present, let it be what it would.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set
myself upon the scout as often as possible, and
indeed so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for
it was above a year and a half that I waited, and
for a great part of that time went out to the west
end, and to the south-west corner of the island,
almost every day, to see the canoes, but none ap-
peared: this was very discouraging, and began to
trouble me much; though I cannot say that it did
in this case, as it had done some time before that,
viz. wear off the edge of my desire to the thing;
but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more
eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first more
careful to shun the sight of these savages, and
avoid being seen by them, than I was now eager to
be upon them. -
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one,
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever
I should direct them, and to prevent their being
able, at any time, to do me any hurt. It was a
great while that I pleased myself with this affair,
but nothing still presented; all my fancies and
schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near
me for a great while.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were,
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an
occasion to put them in execution, I was surprised
one morning early, with seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed,
and out of my sight: the number of them broke
all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing
that they always came four, or six, or sometimes
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty
or thirty men single-handed; so I lay still in my
castle, perplexed and discomforted: however, I
put myself into all the same postures for an attack
that I had formerly provided, and was just ready
for action, if any thing had presented. Having
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made
any noise; at length being very impatient, I set
my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered
T 4
up to the top of the hill by my two stages, as
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not
appear above the hill, so that they could not per-
ceive me by any means: here I observed, by the
help of my perspective glass, that they were no
less than thirty in number; that they had a fire
kindled, and that they had meat dressed; how
they cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was ;
but they were all dancing in I know not how
many barbarous gestures and figures, their own
way, round the fire. º - -
... When I was thus looking on them, I perceived
by my perspective two miserable wretches dragged
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fall, being
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden
sword, for that was their way; and two or three
others were at work immediately, cutting him open
for their cookery, while the other victim was left
standing by himself, till they should be ready for
him: in that very moment this poor wretch, seeing
himself a little at liberty, nature inspired him with
hopes of life, and he started away from them, and
ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, di-
rectly towards me, I mean, towards that part of the
coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
ledge) when I perceived him to run my way; and
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued
by the whole body; and now I expected that part
of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would
certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could
not depend, by any means, upon my dream for
the rest of it, viz. that the other savages would
not pursue him thither, and find him there. How-
ever, I kept my station, and my spirits began to
recover, when I found that there were not above
three men that followed him ; and still more was
I encouraged, when I found he outstript them ex-
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them,
so that if he could but hold it for half an hour, I
saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the
creek, which I mentioned often at the first part of
my story, when I landed my cargoes out of the
ship; and this I knew, he must necessarily swim
over, or the poor wretch would be taken there:
but when the savage escaping came thither, he
made nothing of it, though the tide was then up;
but plunging in, swam • through, in about thirty
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ranton with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three
pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and that
he, standing on the other side, looked at the other,
but went no farther; and soon after went softly
back again, which, as it happened, was very well
for him in the main. 7
I observed, that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the creek
than the fellow was that fled from them. It came
now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed
irresistibly, that now was my time to get a ser-
vant, and perhaps a companion, or assistant, and
that I was called plainly by Providence to save this
poor creature's life. I immediately got down the
ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my
two guns, for they were both at the foot of the
ladder, as I observed above; and getting up again
with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed
towards the sea; and having a very short cut, and
all down hill, clapped myself in the way between
the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to
him that fled, who, looking back, was at first per-
haps as much frighted at me as I at them; but I
beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the
two that followed; then rushing at once upon the
foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of
my piece; I was loth to fire, because I would not
have the rest hear, though at that distance it
would not have been easily heard; and being out
of sight of the smoke too, they would not have
easily known what to make of it. Having knocked
this fellow down, the other who pursued him
stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I ad-
vanced apace towards him ; but as I came nearer,
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow,
and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then
necessitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and
killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who
fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his

enemies fallen, and killed (as he thought) yet was
so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece,
that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward
nor went backward, though he seemed rather
inclined to fly still than to come on. I hallooed
again to him, and made signs to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way,
then stopped again, and then a little farther, and
stopped again; and I could then perceive that he
stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner,
and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies
were. I beckoned him again to come to me, and
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token
of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled
at him and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to
him to come still nearer. At length he came close
to me, and he then kneeled down again, kissed
the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and
taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head.
This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there
was more work to do yet; for I perceived the sa-
vage, whom I knocked down, was not killed, but
stunned with the blow, and began to come to him-
self: so I pointed to him, and shewed him the sa-
vage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke
some words to me; and though I could not under-
stand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to
hear, for they were the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for
above five-and-twenty years. But there was no
time for such reflections now : the savage, who
was knocked down, recovered himself so far as
to sit up upon the ground; and I perceived that
my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw
that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I
would shoot him : upon this my savage, for so I
call him now, made a motion to me to lend him
my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my
side; so I did: he no sooner had it, but he runs
to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so
cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have
done it sooner or better; which I thought it very
strange for one, who, I had reason to believe, never
saw a sword in his life before, except their own
wooden swords. However it seems, as I learned
afterwards, they make their wooden swords so
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they
will cut off heads even with them, nay, and arms,
and that at one blow too. When he had done this,
he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and, with abundance
of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it
down, with the head of the savage that he had
killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most was, to
know how I had killed the other Indian so far off;
so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let
him go to him: so I bade him go, as well as I
could. When he came to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him ; turned him first on
one side, then on the other; looked at the wound
the bullet had made, which it seems was just in
his breast, where it had made an hole, and no
great quantity of blood had followed; but he had
bled inwardly, for he was quite dead: then he took
up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow
me, making signs to him that more might come
after them. . - -
Upon this he signed to me that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by
the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs
again to him to do so: he fell to work, and in an
instant he had scraped an hole in the sand with
his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and
then dragged him into it, and covered him, and
did so also by the other. I believe he had buried
them both in a quarter of an hour: then calling
him, away, I carried him not to my castle, but
quite away to my cave, on the farther part of the
island; so I did not let my dream come to pass in
that part; viz. that he came into my grove for
shelter. - - -
Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and a draught of water, , which I found he
was indeed in great distress for, by his running;
and having refreshed him, I made signs for him
to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place
where I had laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and
w
a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon my-
self sometimes: so the poor creature lay down, and
went to sleep.
He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly
well made, with straight long limbs, not too
large, tall, and well-shaped, and, as I reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. He had a very
good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect,
but seemed to have something very manly in his
face, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness
of an European in his countenance too, especially
when he smiled: his hair was long and black, not
curled like wool; his forehead very high and large,
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in
his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite
black, but very tawny, and yet not of an ugly
yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians and Vir-
ginians, and other natives of America are ; but of
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it
something very agreeable, though not very easy
to describe. His face was round and plump, his
nose small, not flat like the negroes, a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-set, and
white as ivory. After he had slumbered, rather
than slept, about half an hour, he waked again,
and comes out of the cave to me, for I had been
milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure
just by. When he espied me, he came running to
me, laying himself down again upon the ground,
with all the possible signs of an humble thankful
disposition, making many antic gestures to shew
it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,
close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before ; and after this, made
all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and
submission imaginable, to let me know how much
he would serve me as long as he lived. I under-
stood him in many things, and let him know I was
very well pleased with him. In a little time I
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to
me: and first, I made him know his name should
be Friday, which was the day I saved his life; and
I called him so for the memory of the time. I
likewise taught him to say Master, and then let
him know that was to be my name; I likewise
taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the
meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before
him, sop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake
of bread to do the like, which he quickly complied
with, and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me,
and let him know I would give him some clothes;
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark-
naked. As we went by the place where he had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot,
and shewed me the marks that he had made to
find them again, making signs to me that we should
dig them up again and eat them. At this I ap-
peared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,
made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he did immediately, with great submission.
I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if
his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had
been, but no appearance of them, or of their canoes;
so that it was plain that they were gone, and had
left their two comrades behind them, without any
search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and ar-
rows at his back, which I found he could use very
dexterously, making him carry one gun for me,
and I two for myself, and away we marched to the
place where these creatures had been; for I had a
mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them.
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill
in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the
horror of the spectacle: indeed it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made
nothing of it. The place was covered with human
bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great pieces
of flesh left here and there half-eaten, mangled,
and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the
triumphant feast they had been making there, after
a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls,
five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and
feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies;
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that
three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing
to himself, was the fourth : that there had been a
great battle between them and their next king,
whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of; and
that they had taken a great number of prisoners, all
which were carried to several places by those that
had taken them in the flight, in order to feast
upon them, as was done here by these wretches
upon those they brought hither. -
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them toge-
ther on an heap, and make a great fire upon it,
and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had
still an hankering stomach after some of the flesh,
and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I disco-
vered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of
it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst
not discover it; for I had, by some means, let him
know, that I would kill him if he offered it.
When he had done this, we came back to our
castle, and there I fell to work with my man Fri-
day. And first of all, I gave him a pair of linen
drawers which I had out of the poor gunner's
chest I mentioned, and which I found in the
wreck; and which, with a little alteration, fitted
him very well: then I made him a jerkin of goat's-
skin as well as my skill would allow, and I was
now grown a tolerably good tailor; and I gave him
a cap, which I had made of a hare-skin, very con-
venient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was
VOL. I. U
dressed, for the present, tolerably well, and mighty
well was he pleased to see himself almost as well
clothed as his master: it is true, he went awkwardly
in these things at first; wearing the drawers was
very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waist-
coat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms;
but a little easing them, where he complained they
hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he
took to them very well.
The next day after I came home to my hutch
with him, I began to consider where I should
lodge him; and that I might do well for him, and
yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent
for him in the vacant place between my two forti-
fications, in the inside of the last, and in the out-
side of the first: and as there was a door or en-
trance there into my cave, I made a formal framed
door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up
in the passage, a little within the entrance; and
causing the door to open on the inside, I barred it
up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so that
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of
my innermost wall, without making so much noise
in getting over, that it must needs awaken me;
for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of
long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to
the side of the hill, which was again laid across with
small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched
over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which
was strong like reeds; and at the hole or place
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had
placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the outside, would not have opened
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great noise; and as to weapons, I took them all
into my side every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere ser-
vant than Friday was to me; without passions, sul-
lenness, or designs; perfectly obliging and engag-
ing; his very affections were tied to me, like those
of a child to a father; and I dare say he would
have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon
any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he
gave me of this, put it out of doubt ; and soon con-
vinced me, that I needed to use no precautions as
to my safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that however it had pleased
GoD in his providence, and in the government of
the works of his hands, to take from so great a
part of the world, of his creatures, the best uses to
which their faculties and the powers of their souls
are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them
the same powers, the same reason, the same affec-
tions, the same sentiments of kindness and obliga-
tion, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,
the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and
all the capacities of doing good, and receiving good,
that he has given to us; and that when he pleases
to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are
as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the
U 2
right uses for which they were bestowed than we
are. And this made me very melancholy some-
times, in reflecting, as the several occasions pre-
sented, how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlightened by the
great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of GoD, and
by the knowledge of his word, added to our un-
derstanding; and why it has pleased GoD to hide
the like saving knowledge from so many millions
of souls, who, if one might judge by this poor sa-
vage, would make a much better use of it than
we did. ' ... "
From hence I sometimes was led too far to in-
vade the sovereignty of Providence; and, as it
were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposi-
tion of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like
duty from both: but I shut it up, and checked my
thoughts with this conclusion. First, that we do
not know by what light and law these should be
condemned; but that as GoD was necessarily, and
by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and just,
so it could not be, but that if these creatures were
all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on
account of sinning against that light, which, as
the scripture says, was a law to themselves, and
by such rules as their consciences would acknow-
ledge to be just, though the foundation was not
discovered to us; and, secondly, that still, as we
are all clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel
could say to him, why hast thou formed me thus?
But to return to my new companion. I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my busi.
ness to teach him every thing that was proper to
make him useful, handy, and helpful; but espe-
cially to make him speak, and understand me when
I spake: and he was the aptest scholar that ever
was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly.
diligent, and so pleased when he could but under-
stand me, or make me understand him, that it was
very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my
life began to be so easy that I began to say to
myself, that could I but have been safe from more
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from
the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to
my castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the
relish of a cannibal’s stomach, I ought to let him
taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one
morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it
home and dress it: but as I was going, I saw a
she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young
kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday,
Hold, said I, stand still ; and made signs to him
not to stir; immediately I presented my piece,
shot and killed one of the kids. The poor crea-
ture, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill
the savage, his enemy, but did not know or could
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised,
trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that
U 3
I thought he would have sunk down; he did not
see the kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed
it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not
wounded; and, as I found, presently thought I was
resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled
down to me, and, embracing my knees, said a
great many things I did not understand; but I
could easily see that his meaning was to pray me
not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I
would do him no harm; and taking him up by the
hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid
which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and
fetch it, which he did; and while he was wonder-
ing and looking to see how the creature was killed,
I loaded my gun again, and by and by I saw a
great fowl, like an hawk, sit upon a tree within
shot: so, to let Friday understand a little what I
would do, I called him to me again, pointing at
the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been an hawk; I say, pointing to
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the parrot, to let him see I would make him fall,
I made him understand that I would shoot and
kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bid him
look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He
stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all
that I had said to him; and I found he was the
more amazed, because he did not see me put any
thing into the gun; but thought there must be
Some wonderful fund of death and destruction in
that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any
thing near or far off: for the astonishment this
created in him was such as could not wear off for
along time; and I believe, if I would have let him,
he would have worshipped me and my gun: as for
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for
several days after; but would speak to it, and talk
to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by
himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was
to desire it not to kill him.
Well: after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I
had shot, which he did, but staid some time; for
the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a
good way off from the place where she fell; how-
ever he found her, took her up, and brought her
to me; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge
the gun again, and not let him see me do it, that
I might be ready for any other mark that might
present; but nothing more offered at that time:
so I brought home the kid; and the same evening I
took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could;
and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or
stewed some of the flesh, and made some very
good broth. After I had began to eat some, I gave
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and
liked it very well; but that which was strangest
to him, was, to see me eat salt with it. He made
a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and
putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to
U 4
nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, wash-
ing his mouth with fresh water after it; on the
other hand, I took some meat in my mouth with-
out salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for
want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt; but
it would not do, he would never care for salt with
meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great while,
and then but a very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and
broth, I was resolved to feast him the next day
with roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by
hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen
many people do in England, setting two poles up,
one on each side the fire, and one across on the top,
and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the
meat turn continually: this Friday admired very
much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he
took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it,
that I could not but understand him; and at last he
told me he would never eat man's flesh any more,
which I was very glad to hear. - -
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do,
as I observed before; and he soon understood how
to do it as well as I, especially after he-had seen
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to
make bread of; for after that I let him see me
make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little
time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as
well as I could do it myself. . . ;
I began now to consider, that having two.
mouths to feed instead of one, I must provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity
of corn than I used to do; so I marked out a lar-
ger piece of land, and began the fence in the same
manner as before, in which Friday not only worked
very willingly, and very hard, but did it very
cheerfully; and I told him what it was for, that it
was for corn to make more bread, because he was
now with me, and that I might have enough for him
and myself too: he appeared very sensible of that
part, and let me know, that he thought I had much
more labour upon me on his account than I had
for myself, and that he would work the harder for
me, if I would tell him what to do. . . . *
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I le
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well,
and understand the names of almost every thing
I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so
that, in short, I began now to have some use for
my tongue again, which indeed I had very little
occasion for before ; that is to say, about speech.
Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a sin-
gular satisfaction in the fellow himself; his simple
unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more
every day, and I began really to love the creature;
and on his side, I believe he loved me more than
it was possible for him ever to love any thing be-
fore. -
I had a mind once to try if he had any hanker-
ing inclination to his own country again; and
having taught him English so well that he could
answer me almost any questions, I asked him, whe-
ther the nation that he belonged to never conquered
in battle? At which he smiled, and said, Yes, yes,
we always fight the better; that is, he meant,
always get the better in fight; and so we began
the following discourse. You always fight the
better! said I. How came you to be taken pri-
soner then, Friday?
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Master. How beat? if your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken 2
Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me.
My nation over beat them in the yonder place,
where me no was; there my nation take one, two,
great thousand.
Master. But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe; my nation have no cano
that time. -
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your na-
tion do with the men they take Do they carry
them away, and eat them as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Master. Where do they carry them?
- Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
- Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither: come
other else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here [points to the N. W.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their
side.] -
By this I understood, that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages who used to
come on shore, on the farther part of the island,
on the said man-eating occasions that he was now
brought for; and some time after, when I took
the courage to carry him to that side, being the
same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew
the place, and told me, he was there once when
they eat up twenty men, two women, and one
child: he could not tell twenty in English, but he
numbered them by laying so many stones in a row,
and pointed to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces
what follows;–that after I had had this discourse
with him, I asked him, how far it was from our
island to the shore, and whether the canoes were
not often lost? He told me there was no danger,
no canoes ever lost; but that after a little way
out to sea, there was a current, and a wind always
one way in the morning, the other in the after-
Il OOIl.
This I understand to be no more than the sets
of the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque;
in the mouth of which river, as I thought after-
wards, our island lay; and that this land, which I
perceived to the W. and N. W. was the great
island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth
of the river: I asked Friday a thousand questions
about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the
coast, and what nations were near : he told me all
he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable.
I asked him the names of the several nations of
his sort of people, but could get no other name
than Caribs; from whence I easily understood,
that these were the Caribbees, which our maps
place on that part of America which reaches from
the mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea, and
onwards to St. Martha: he told me, that up a
great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond
the setting of the moon, which must be W. from
their country, there dwelt white-bearded men, like
me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I
mentioned before; and that they had killed much
mans, that was his word: by which I understood
he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in Ame-
rica had been spread over the whole countries,
and were remembered by all the nations from father
to SOn. - -
. I enquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men:
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe; I
could not understand what he meant by two canoe;
till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant,
that it must be in a large great boat as big as two
Ca11OeS. - -
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish
with me very well; and from this time I enter-
tained some hopes, that one time or other I might
find an opportunity to make my escape from this
place, and that this poor savage might be a means
to help me to do it. -
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foun-
dation of religious knowledge in his mind; parti-
cularly, I asked him one time, Who made him 2
The poor creature did not understand me at all,
but thought I had asked who was his father: but
I took it by another handle, and asked him, Who
made the sea, the ground he walked on, and the
hills and woods? He told me, it was one old Bena-
muckee that lived beyond all; he could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very
old; much older, he said, than the sea or the land,
than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, If
this old person had made all things, why did not
all things worship him He looked very grave, and
with a perfect look of innocence, said, All things
said O' to him. I asked him if the people who die
in his country went away any-where? He said,
Yes, they all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked
him, whether those they eat up went thither too?
he said, Yes.
From these things I began to instruct him in
the knowledge of the true God. I told him that
the great Maker of all things lived there, pointing
up towards heaven: that he governs the world by
the same power and providence by which he made
it; that he was omnipotent, could do every thing
for us, give every thing to us, take every thing
from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes.
He listened with great attention, and received with
pleasure the notion of JESUS CHRIST being sent to
redeem us, and of the manner of making our
prayers to GoD, and his being able to hear us,
even into heaven. He told me one day, that if
our GoD could hear us up beyond the sun, he
must needs be a greater GoD than their Bena-
muckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not hear, till they went up to the great
mountains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I
asked him, if ever he went thither to speak to him?
He said, No, they never went that were young
men; none went thither but the old men; whom
he called their Oowookakee, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy;
and that they went to say O! (so he called saying
prayers), and then came back, and told them what
Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there
is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded igno-
rant Pagans in the world; and the policy of mak-
ing a secret religion, in order to preserve the vene-
ration of the people to the clergy, is not only to be
found in the Roman, but perhaps among all reli-
gions in the world, even among the most brutish
and barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday; and told him, that the pretence of their
old men going up to the mountains to say O! to
their god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their
bringing word from thence what he said, was
much more so; that if they met with any answer,
or spoke with any one there, it must be with an
evil spirit: and then I entered into a long dis-
course with him about the devil, the original of
him, his rebellion against GoD, his enmity to man,
the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark
parts of the world to be worshipped instead of
GoD, and as GoD, and the many stratagems he
made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how
he had a secret access to our passions and to our
affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations,
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and
to run upon our own destructions by our own
choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right no-
tions in his mind about the devil as it was about
the being of a GoD : nature assisted all my argu-
ments to evidence to him even the necessity of a
great first cause, and over-ruling governing power,
a secret directing Providence, and of the equity
and justice of paying homage to him that made
us, and the like: but there appeared nothing of
all this in the notion of an evil spirit; of his ori-
ginal, his being, his nature, and above all, of his
inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so
too: and the poor creature puzzled me once in
such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him.
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power
of God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to
sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of
iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could
destroy us, and all the world, in a moment; and
he listened with great seriousness to me all the
while.
. After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was GoD's enemy in the hearts of men, and used
all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs
of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of CHRIST
in the world, and the like: Well, says Friday, but
you say God is so strong, so great, is he not much
strong, much might as the devil? Yes, yes, said I,
Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is
above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to
tread him under our feet, and enable us to resist
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts. But
says he again, If God much strong, much might
as the devil, why God not kill the devil, so make
him no more wicked. -
, I was strangely surprised at his question; and
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a
casuist or a solver of difficulties: and, at first, I
could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to
hear him, and asked him what he said 2 but he was
too earnest for an answer to forget his question:
so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words as above. By this time I had recovered
myself a little, and I said, GoD will at last punish
him severely; he is reserved for the judgment,
and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell
with everlasting fire. This did not satisfy Friday;
but he returns upon me, repeating my words, Re-
serve at last! me no understand; but why not kill
the devil now, not kill great ago? You may as
well ask me, said I, why God does not kill you
and me, when we do wicked things here that
offend him : we are preserved to repent and be
pardoned. He muses awhile at this: Well, well,
says he, mighty affectionately, that well; so you,
I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, GoD par-
don all. Here I was run down again by him to
the last degree, and it was a testimony to me, how
the mere notions of nature, though they will guide
reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God,
and of a worship or homage due to the supreme
being of GoD, as the consequence of our nature;
yet nothing but divine revelation can form the
knowledge of Jesus CHRIST, and of a redemption
purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new cove-
nant; and of an Intercessor at the footstool of
God's throne: I say nothing but a revelation from
Heaven can form these in the soul; and that there-
fore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
CHRIST, I mean the word of God, and the Spirit
of GoD, promised for the guide and sanctifier of
his people, are the absolutely necessary instructors
of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of
GoD, and the means of salvation.
VOL. I. X
I therefore diverted the present discourse be-
tween me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon
some sudden occasion of going out ; then sending
him for something a great way off, I seriously
prayed to GoD, that he would enable me to in-
struct savingly this poor savage, assisting by his
Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to
receive the light of the knowledge of God in
CHRIST, reconciling him to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the word of
GoD, as his conscience might be convinced, his
eyes opened, and his soul saved: when he came
again to me, I entered into a long discourse with
him upon the subject of the redemption of man
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine
of the Gospel preached from heaven, viz. of re-
pentance towards GoD, and faith in our blessed
LoRD JESUs ; I then explained to him, as well as
I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on
him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham,
and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no
share in the redemption; that he came only to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, GoD knows, more sincerity than know-
ledge, in all the methods I took for this poor
creature’s instruction; and must acknowledge what
I believe all that act upon the same principle
will find, that in laying things open to him, I
really informed and instructed myself in many
things, that either I did not know, or had not
fully considered before; but which occurred na-
turally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the information of this poor savage; and I had
more affection in my inquiry after things upon
this occasion, than ever I felt before : so that whe-
ther this poor wild wretch was the better for me
or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever
he came to me: my grief sat lighter upon me, my
habitation grew comfortable to me beyond mea-
sure; and when I reflected, that in this solitary
life, which I had been confined to, I had not only
been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to
seek to the hand that brought me thither, but was
now to be made an instrument, under Providence,
to save the life, and, for aught I know, the soul of
a poor savage, and bring him to the true know-
ledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine,
that he might know CHRIST JESUs, to know whom
is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all
these things, a secret joy ran through every part
of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I
was brought to this place, which I had often
thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that
could possibly have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the re-
mainder of my time; and the conversation which
employed the hours between Friday and me was
such as made the three years which we lived there
together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be found in
a sublunary state. The savage was now a good
Christian, a much better than I; though I have
X 2.
reason to hope, and bless GoD for it, that we were
equally penitent, and comforted restored peni-
tents: we had here the word of GoD to read, and
no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than if we
had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him know, as well as I could, the mean-
ing of what I read; and he again by his serious
inquiries and questions, made me, as I said before,
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge,
than I should ever have been by my own private
reading: another thing I cannot refrain from ob-
serving here also, from experience, in this retired
part of my life; viz. how infinite and inexpres-
sible a blessing it is, that the knowledge of God,
and of the doctrine of salvation by CHRIST Jesus,
is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so
easy to be received and understood, that as the
bare reading the Scripture made me capable of un-
derstanding enough of my duty to carry me di-
rectly on to the great work of sincere repentance
for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life
and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice,
and obedience to all God’s commands, and this
without any teacher or instructor, (I mean hu-
man) so the plain instruction sufficiently served
to the enlightening this savage creature, and
bringing him to be such a Christian as I have
known few equal to him in my life. -
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife and con-
tention, which has happened in the world about
religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes
of church government, they were all perfectly
useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they
have been to all the rest in the world: we had
the sure guide to heaven, viz. the word of God;
and we had, blessed be GoD ! comfortable views of
the Spirit of God, teaching and instructing us by
his word, leading us into all truth, and making us
both willing and obedient to the instruction of
his word: and I cannot see the least use that the
greatest knowledge of the disputed points in reli-
gion, which have made such confusions in the
world, would have been to us, if we could have
obtained it.—But I must go on with the historical
part of things, and take every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all
I said to him, and speak fluently, though in bro-
ken English, to me, I acquainted him with my
own story, or at least so much of it as related to
my coming into the place; how I had lived there,
and how long. I let him into the mystery (for
such it was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with ; and I
made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as
in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog,
instead of an hanger, I gave him an hatchet, which
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon many occasions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
e
-
X 3
particularly England, which I came from ; how we
lived, how we worshipped GoD, how we behaved
to one another, and how we traded in ships to all
the parts of the world. I gave him an account of
the wreck which I had been on board of, and
shewed him, as near as I could, the place where
she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces long be-
fore, and quite gone.
I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we
lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir
with my whole strength then, but was now fallen
almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Fri-
day stood musing a great while, and said nothing;
I asked him what it was he studied upon 2 At last,
says he, Me see such boat like come to place at my
nation.
I did not understand him a good while; but at
last, when I had examined further into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived,
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined that some
European ship must have been cast away upon
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive
ashore; but was so dull, that I never once thought
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much
less whence they might come; so I only inquired
after a description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough;
but brought me better to understand him, when
he added, with some warmth, We save the white
>
mans from drown: then I presently asked him,
if there were any white mans, as he called them,
in the boat? Yes, he said, the boat full of white
mans. I asked him, how many 2 he told upon his
fingers seventeen. I asked him then, what became
of them 2 he told me, They live, they dwell at my
nation. w -
This put new thoughts into my head again; for
I presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight
of my island, as I now call it: and who, after the
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her in-
evitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat,
and were landed upon that wild shore among the
savages.
Upon this I inquired of him more critically,
what was become of them He assured me they
lived still there, that they had been there about four
years, that the savages let them alone, and gave
them victuals to eat. I asked him, how it came
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them? he
said, No, they make brother with them : that is, as
I understood him, a truce: and then he added,
They eat no mans but when make the war fight:
that is to say, they never eat any men, but such
as come to fight with them, and are taken in
battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence, as I have said, I had in a
clear day discovered the main or continent of Ame-
x 4
rica; Friday, the weather being very serene, looks
very earnestly towards the main land, and in a
kind of surprise falls a jumping and dancing, and
calls out to me, for I was at some distance from
him. I asked him what was the matter Ojoy,
says he, O glad there see my country, there my
nation
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and
his countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as
if he had a mind to be in his own country again;
and this observation of mine put a great many
thoughts into me; which made me at first not so
easy about my new man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt, but that if Friday could get
back to his own nation again, he would not only
forget all his religion, but all his obligations to
me; and would be forward enough to give his
countrymen an account of me, and come back per-
haps with an hundred or two of them, and make
a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry
as he used to be with those of his enemies, when
they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards:
however, as my jealousy increased, and held me
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before ; in which
I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest
grateful creature having no thought about it, but
what consisted of the best principles, both as a
religious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as ap-
peared afterwards, to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him, to see if he
would discover any of the new thoughts which I
suspected were in him; but I found every thing he
said was so honest, and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite
of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely
his own again; nor did he in the least perceive
that I was uneasy; and therefore I could not sus-
pect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see
the continent, I called to him, and said, Friday,
do not you wish yourself in your own country,
your own nation ? Yes, he said, I be much O glad
to be at my own nation. What would you do
there said I: would you turn wild again, eat
men's flesh again: and be a savage as you were be-
fore ? He looked full of concern, and shaking his
head, said, No, no, Friday tell them to live good,
tell them to pray GoD, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again. Why then,
said I to him, they will kill you. He looked
grave at that, and then said, No, they no kill me,
they willing love learn : he meant by this, they
would be willing to learn. He added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat.
Then I asked him, if he would go back to them?
He smiled at that, and told me he could not swim
so far. I told him I would make a canoe for him.
He told me he would go, if I would go with him.
I go said I, why they will eat me if I come
there. No, no, says he, Me make them no eat
you, me make them much love you: he meant he
would tell them how I had killed his enemies and
saved his life, and so he would make them love me.
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded
men, as he called them, who came on shore in dis-
treSS.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to
venture over, and see if I could possibly join with
these bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were
Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but if I
could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good com-
pany together, better than I could from an island
forty miles off the shore, and alone without help.
So, after some days, I took Friday to work again,
by way of discourse; and told him, I would give
him a boat to go back to his own nation; and ac-
cordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay
on the other side of the island; and having cleared
it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water),
I brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went
into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at ma-
maging it; he would make it go almost as swift and
fast again as I could ; so when he was in, I said
to him, Well now, Friday, shall we go to your
mation ? He looked very dull at my saying so,
which it seems, was because he thought the boat
too small to go so far. I told him then I had a
bigger: so the next day I went to the place where
the first boat lay which I had made, but which I
could not get into the water; he said that was big
enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it,
and it had lain two or three-and-twenty years
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was
in a manner rotten. Friday told me, such a boat
would do very well, and would carry much
‘ enough vittle, drink, bread;’ that was his way of
talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed
upon my design of going over with him to the con-
tinent, that I told him we would go and make one
as big as that, and he should go home in it. He
answered not one word, but looked very grave and
sad. I asked him, what was the matter with him?
He asked me again thus, Why you angry mad
with Friday? what me done I asked him what
he meant? I told him I was not angry with him
at all. No angry, no angry! says he, repeating the
word several times. Why send Friday home away
to my nation ? Why, said I, Friday, did you not say
you wished you were there? Yes, yes, says he,
wish be both there; no wish Friday there, no
master there. In a word, he would not think of
going there without me. I go there, Friday! said
I, what should I do there He turned very quick
upon me at this. You do great deal much good,
says he, you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame
mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and
live new life. Alas, Friday, said I, thou knowest
not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man
myself. Yes, yes, says he, you teechee me good,
you teechee them good. No, no, Friday, said I,
you shall go without me; leave me here to live
by myself, as I did before. He looked confused
again at that word, and running to one of the hat-
chets which he used to wear, he takes it up has-
tily, and gives it me. What must I do with this 2
said I to him. You take kill Friday, says he.
What must I kill you for? said I again. He re-
turns very quick, What you send Friday away for 2
Take kill Friday, no send Friday away. This he
spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the ut-
most affection in him to me, and a firm resolution
in him, that I told him then, and often after, that
I would never send him away from me, if he was
willing to stay with me. -
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should
part him from me, so I found all the foundation of
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my
doing them good ; a thing which as I had no no-
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or
intention, or desire of undertaking it: but still I
found a strong inclination to my attempting an es-
cape, as above, founded on the supposition ga-

thered from the former discourse; viz. that there
were seventeen bearded men there : and therefore,
without any delay, I went to work with Friday, to
find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a
large periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage.
There were trees enough in the island to have
built a little fleet, not of periaguas and canoes
only, but even of good large vessels: but the
main thing I looked at, was to get one so near
the water, that we might launch it when it
was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at
first. -
At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found
he knew much better than I what kind of wood
was fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what
wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it
was very like the tree we call fustic, or between
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of
the same colour and smell. Friday was for burning
the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it
into a boat; but I shewed him how rather to cut it
out with tools, which after I shewed him how to
use, he did very handily; and in about a month’s
hard labour we finished it, and made it very hand.
some, especially when, with our axes, which I
shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the
outside into the true shape of a boat. After this,
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to
get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon
great rollers into the water: but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men with great ease.
When she was in the water, and though she
was so big, it amazed me to see with what dexte-
rity and how swift my man Friday could manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along ; so I asked
him if he would go, and if we might venture over
in her? Yes, he said, he venture over in her very
well, though great blow wind: however, I had a
farther design that he knew nothing of, and that
was to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with an
anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy
enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight young
cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and
which there was a great plenty of in the island;
and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it: but as
to the sail, that was my particular care; I knew I
had old sails or rather pieces of old sails enough;
but as I had had them now twenty-six years by me,
and had not been very careful to preserve them,
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of
use for them, I did not doubt but they were all
rotten; and indeed most of them were so: however,
I found two pieces which appeared pretty good,
and with these I went to work, and with a great
deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you
may be sure) for want of needles, I at length made
a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in
England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a
boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top,
such as usually our ships long-boats sail with, and
such as I best knew how to manage; because it was
such a one as I used in the boat in which I made
my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part
of my story.
I was near two months performing this last
work; viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails;
for I finished them very complete, making a
small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if
we should turn to windward; and, which was more
than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to
steer with ; and though I was but a bungling ship-
wright, yet, as I knew the usefulness, and even ne-
cessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so
much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to
pass, though, considering the many dull contri-
vances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me
almost as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a
sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when
he saw me work the boat to-and-again in the sea
by the rudder, and how the sail gybed, and filled
this way or that way, as the course we sailed
changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like
one astonished and amazed; however, with a little
use, I made all these things familiar to him, and
he became an expert sailor, except that as to the
compass I could make him understand very little
of that: on the other hand, as there was very little
cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in
those parts, there was the less occasion for a com-
pass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by
night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy
seasons; and then nobody cared to stir abroad,
either by land or sea. -
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habita-
tion being quite of another kind than in all the
rest of my time. I kept the anniversary of my
landing here with the same thankfulness to God
for his mercies as at first; and if I had such cause
of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so
now, having such additional testimonies of the care
of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had
of being effectually and speedily delivered; for I
had an invincible impression upon my thoughts,
that my deliverance was at hand, and that J
should not be another year in this place: how.
ever, I went on with my husbandry, digging,
planting, and fencing, as usual; I gathered and
cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing, as
before.
The rainy season was in the meantime upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship; and haling her up to the shore, at high-water
*
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock,
just big enough for her to floatin; and then, when
the tide was out, we made a strong dam cross the
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay
dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the
rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees so
thick, that she was as well thatched as an house;
and thus we waited for the months of November
and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure. ... "
When the settled season began to come in, as
the thought of my design returned with the fair
weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage;
and the first thing I did was to lay up a certain
quantity of provision, being the store for the voy-
age; and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time,
to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was
busy one morning upon something of this kind,
when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the
sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tor-
toise, a thing which we generally got once a week,
for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Fri-
day had not been long gone, when he came run-
ning back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the
steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to
speak to him, he cried out to me, O master! O
master! O sorrow ! O bad | What’s the matter,
Friday 2 said I. Oyonder there, says he, one, two,
three, canoe! one, two, three | By this way of
speaking I concluded there were six; but on en-
VOL. I. Y
quiry I found there were but three. Well, Friday,
said I, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up
as well as I could. However, I saw the poor fel-
low most terribly scared; for nothing ran in his
head but that they were come to look for him, and
would cut him in pieces, and eat him; the poor
fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do
with him: I comforted him as well as I could,
and told him I was in as much danger as he, and
that they would eat me as well as him: but, said I,
Friday, we must resolve to fight them : Can you
fight, Friday? Me shoot, says he, but there come
many great number. No matter for that, said I
again, our guns will fright them that we do not
kill. So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to
defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as Ibade him P. He said, Me die,
when you bid die, master; so I went and fetched
a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had been
so good an husband of my rum, that I had a great
deal left: when he had drank it, I made him take
the two fowling-pieces which we always carried,
and load them with large swan-shot as big as small
pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded
them with two slugs, and five small bullets each;
and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets
each: I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by
my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and
that their whole business seemed to be the trium-
phant banquet upon these three human bodies; a
barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than as I
had observed was usual with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to
the sea : this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman
errand these wretches came about, so filled me with
indignation, that I came down again to Friday,
and told him, I was resolved to go down to them,
and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand
by me. He was now gotten over his fright, and
his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had
given him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as
before, he would die when I bid die.
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the
arms which I had charged, as before, between us;
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pis-
tol, and the other three myself; and in this posture
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged
him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, shoot,
or do any thing till I bid him; and in the mean-
time, not to speak a word: in this posture I fetched
a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well
Y 2
to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so
that I might come within shot of them before I
could be discovered, which I had seen by my glass
it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolu-
tion; I do not mean, that I entertained any fear
of their number; for as they were naked, unarmed
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them; nay,
though I had been alone: but it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less
what necessity I was in, to go and dip my hands
in blood, to attack people who had neither done
or intended me any wrong; who, as to me, were
innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their
own disaster, being in them a token indeed of
GoD's having left them, with the other nations of
that part of the world, to such stupidity and to
such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take
upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less
an executioner of his justice; that whenever he
thought fit, he would take the cause into his own
hands, and by national vengeance punish them for
national crimes; but that in the meantime, it was
none of my business: that it was true, Friday might
justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in
a state of war with those very particular people, and
it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to me. These things
were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the
way as I went, that I resolved I would only go
place myself near them, that I might observe their
barbarous feast, and that I would act then as GoD
should direct; but that unless something offered
that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I
would not meddle with them. - -
With this resolution I entered the wood, and
with all possible wariness and silence (Friday fol-
lowing close at my heels) I marched till I came
to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was
next to them; only that one corner of the wood
lay between me and them: here I called softly to
Friday, and shewing him a great tree, which was
just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to
the tree, and bring me word if he could see there
plainly what they were doing : he did so, and
came immediately back to me, and told me they
might be plainly viewed there; that they were all
about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their pri-
soners; and that another lay bound upon the sand,
a little from them, whom he said they would kill
next, and which fired the very soul within me.
He told me, it was not one of their nation, but
one of the bearded men whom he had told me of,
who came to their country in the boat. I was
filled with horror at the very naming the white-
bearded man, and, going to the tree, I saw plainly,
by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the beach
of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with flags,
or things like rushes; and that he was an European,
and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket be-
Y 3
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the
place where I was, which, by going a little way
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and
that then I should be within half shot of them; so
I withheld my passion, though I was indeed en-
raged to the highest degree: and going back about
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and
then I came to a little rising ground, which gave
me a full view of them, at the distance of about
eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen
of the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all
close huddled together, and had just sent the other
two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him,
perhaps limb by limb, to their fire; and they were
stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I
turned to Friday; Now, Friday, said I, do as Ibid
thee. Friday said, he would. Then, Friday, said
I, do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing.
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by
his ; and with the other musket I took my aim at
the savages, bidding him do the like. Then ask-
ing him if he was ready, he said, Yes. Then fire
at them, said I; and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them,
and wounded three more; and on my side, I killed
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadful consternation: and all of them,
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet im-
mediately, but did not know which way to run, or
which way to look; for they knew not from whence
their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close
upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe
what I did; so as soon as the first shot was made,
I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-
piece, and Friday did the like: he sees me cock,
and present; he did the same again. Are you
ready, Friday? said I. Yes, says he. Let fly then,
said I, in the name of God; and with that I fired
again among the amazed wretches, and so did
Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden with
what I called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we
found only two drop; but so many were wounded,
that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody, and miserably wounded most
of them; whereof three more fell quickly after,
though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, said I, laying down the discharged
pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, follow me, said I; which he did, with a
deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the
wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot: as soon as I perceived they saw me, Ishouted
as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and
running as fast as I could, which by the way was
not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I
made directly towards the poor victim, who was,
as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between
the place where they sat and the sea; the two
Y 4
butchers, who were just going to work with him,
had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and
fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest
made the same way: I turned to Friday, and bade
him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood
me immediately, and running about forty yards to
be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he
had killed them all; for I saw them all fall on an
heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up
again quickly: however, he killed two of them,
and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled
out my knife, and cut the flags that bound the
poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet I
lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese
tongue, what he was 2 He answered in Latin,
Christianus; but was so weak and faint, that he
could scarce stand, or speak; I took my bottle out
of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that
he should drink, which he did ; and I gave him a
piece of bread, which he eat; then I asked him,
what countryman he was? and he said, Espagnole;
and, being a little recovered, let me know, by all
the signs he could possibly make, how much he
was in my debt for his deliverance. Seignior, said
I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, we
will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if
you have any strength left, take this pistol and
sword, and lay about you : he took them very
thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in his
hands, but as if they had put new vigour into him,
he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had
cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the
truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the
poor creatures were so much frighted with the
noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere
amazement and fear, and had no more power to
attempt their own escape, than their flesh had to
resist our shot; and that was the case of those five
that Friday shot in the boat; for as three of them
fell with the hurt they received, so the other two
fell with the fright. . a'
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so
I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the
tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms
which lay there, that had been discharged, which
he did with great swiftness; and then giving him
my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest
again, and bade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there
happened a fierce engagement between the Spa-
niard and one of the savages, who made at him
with one of their great wooden swords, the same
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I
had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as
bold and as brave as could be imagined, though
weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had
cut him two great wounds on his head; but the
savage, being a stout lusty fellow, closing in with
him, had thrown him down (being faint), and was
wringing my sword out of his hand, when the
Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting his
sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the
savage through the body, and killed him upon the
spot, before I, who was running to help, could come
near him. -
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three,
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling pieces, with which he pursued
two of the savages, and wounded them both; but
as he was not able to run, they both got from him
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and
killed one of them ; but the other was too nimble
for him; and though he was wounded, yet he
plunged into the sea, and swam with all his might
off to those who were left in the canoe, which three
in the canoe, with one wounded, who we know not
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our
hands of one-and-twenty. The account of the rest
is as follows:
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.
1 Killed by ditto, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there
of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his
chace of them. .
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded,
if not dead.
21 in all.
Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to
get out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two
or three shot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them. Friday would fain have had me take
one of their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed
I was very anxious about their escape, lest carry-
ing the news home to their people, they should
come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of
their canoes, and devour us by mere multitudes;
so I consented to pursue them by sea; and running
to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I
was surprised to find another poor creature lie there
alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was,
for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not
knowing what the matter was; for he had not been
able to look up over the side of the boat, he was
tied so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so
long, that he had really little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up ; but he could not stand, or speak,
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems,
still, that he was only unbound in order to be
killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered,
revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when
Friday came to hear him speak, and looked in his
face, it would have moved any one to tears, to have
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hug-
ged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head, and then sung and
jumped about again like a distracted creature. It
was a good while before I could make him speak
to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when
he came a little to himself, he told me that it was
his father.
It was not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasy and filial affection had
worked in this poor savage, at the sight of his fa-
ther, and of his being delivered from death; nor
indeed can I describe half the extravagancies of his
affection after this ; for he went into the boat and
out of the boat a great many times: when he went
in to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast,
and hold his father's head close to his bosom half
an hour together, to nourish it; then he took his
arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with
the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his
hands; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave
him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with,
which did them a great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the
canoe with the other savages, who were now gotten
almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that
we did not; for it blew so hard within two hours
after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night,
and that from the north-west, which was against
them, that I could not suppose their boat could live,
or that they ever reached to their own coast.
But to return to Friday; he was so busy about
his father, that I could not find in my heart to take
him off for some time: but after I thought he could
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest
extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his
father any bread 2 He shook his head, and said,
None: ugly dog eat all up self. So I gave him a
cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on
purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but
he would not taste it, but carried it to his father.
I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of
my raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for
his father. He had no sooner given his father
these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat,
and run away as if he had been bewitched. He ran
at such a rate (for he was the swiftest fellow of
his feet that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate,
that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant;
and though I called and hallooed too after him, it
was all one; away he went, and in a quarter of an
hour I saw him come back again, though not so
fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found
his pace was slacker, because he had something in
his hand. -
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water; and that he had got two
more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me, but the water he carried to his father: how-
ever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup
of it: this water revived his father more than all
the rum or spirits I had given him; for he was just
fainting with thirst.
When his father had drank, I called him, to
know if there was any water left; he said, Yes; and
Ibade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in
as much want of it as his father; and I sent one
of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been
tied with : when I saw that upon Friday's coming
to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and
took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him,
and gave him an handful of raisins; he looked up
in my face, with all the tokens of gratitude and
thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon
his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but
was really not able, his ankles were so swelled and
so painful to him; so Ibade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum,
as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about, to see if his father was
in the same place and posture as he left him
sitting; and at last he found he was not to be .
seen; at which he started up, and, without speak-
ing a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that
one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the
ground as he went: but when he came, he only
found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs:
so Friday came back to me presently, and I then
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up,
if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him: but Friday, a lusty young fellow,
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and car-
ried him away to the boat, and set him down softly
upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his
feet in the inside of it, and then lifted them quite
in, and set him close to his father, and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and
paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk,
though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he
brought them both safe into our creek; and leav-
ing them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other
canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and
asked him, whither he went? He told me, Go
fetch more boat; so away he went like the wind;
for sure never man or horse ran like him, and he
had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as
I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and
then went to help our new guests out of the boat,
which he did; but they were neither of them
able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what
to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thºught,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
bank while he came to me, Isoqn made a kind of
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car-
ried them up both together upon it between us;
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before ;
for it was impossible to get them over; and I was
resolved not to break it down : so I set to work
again; and Friday and I, in about two hours time,
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails,
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted:
and here we made two beds of such things as I
had ; viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid
upon it to lie on, and another to cover them on
each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought my-
self very rich in subjects; and it was a merry re-
flection which I frequently made, how like a king

I looked: first of all the whole country was my own
mere property; so that I had an undoubted right
of dominion; 2dly, My people were perfectly sub-
jected. I was absolute lord and lawgiver; they
all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their lives, if there had been oceasion for it,
for me: it was remarkable too, I had but three
subjects, and they were of three different religions.
My man Friday was a protestant, his father a pagan
and a cannibal; and the Spaniard was a papist:
however, I allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions: but this by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
provision for them; and the first thing I did, I
ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a
kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be
killed : then I cut off the hind quarter, and, chop-
ping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to
boiling and stewing, and made them a very good
dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; having put
some barley and rice also into the broth, and as I
cooked it without doors (for I made no fire within
my inner wall) so I carried it all into the new
tent; and having set a table there for them, I sat
down and eat my dinner also with them; and, as
well as I could, cheered them and encouraged
them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spa-
niard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.
VOL. I. Z
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our musquets and other fire-arms, which, for want
of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and
the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun,
and would presently be offensive; and I also ordered
him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous
feast, which I knew were pretty much, and which
I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could
not bear to see them, if I went that way; all which
he punctually performed, and defaced the very ap-
pearance of the savages being there; so that when
I went again, I could scarce know where it was,
otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing
to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects; and first I set Friday
to inquire of his father, what he thought of the
escape of the savages in that canoe? and whether
he might expect a return of them with a power
too great for us to resist? His first opinion was,
that the savages in the boat never could live out
the storm which blew that night they went off,
but must of necessity be drowned or driven south
to those other shores, where they were as sure to
be devoured, as they were to be drowned if they
were cast away; but as to what they would do if
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not: but
it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully
frighted with the manner of being attacked, the
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would
tell their people they were all killed by thunder
and lightning, and not by the hand of man; and
that the two which appeared (viz. Friday and I)
were two heavenly spirits or furies come down to
destroy them, and not men with weapons. This,
he said, he knew, because he heard them cry out
so in their language to one another; for it was im-
possible for them to conceive that a man should
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance,
without lifting up the hand, as was done now.
And this old savage was in the right, for, as J un-
derstood since by other hands, the savages of that
part never attempted to go over to the island after-
wards. They were so terrified with the accounts
given by these four men (for it seems they did
escape the sea), that they believed whoever went
to that enchanted island would be destroyed with
fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was
under continual apprehensions for a good while,
and kept always upon my guard, I and all my
army; for as there were now four of us, I would
have ventured upon an hundred of them fairly in
the open field at any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes ap-
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I
began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to
the main into consideration, being likewise as-
sured by Friday's father, that I might depend upon
good usage from their nation on his account, if I
would go.
Z 2
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when
I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and
when I understood, that there were sixteen more
of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having
been cast away, and made their escape to that side,
lived there at peace indeed with the savages, but
were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed
for life. I asked him all the particulars of their
voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship
bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna,
being directed to leave their loading there, which
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back
what European goods they could meet with there;
that they had five Portuguese seamen on board,
whom they took out of another wreck; that five
of their own men were drowned when first the ship
was lost; and that these escaped through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrived almost starved on
the Cannibal coast, where they expected to have
been devoured every moment. -
He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder or ball, the washing of the sea having
spoiled all their powder, but a little which they
used at their first landing to provide themselves
some food. . -
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making any escape He said, they had many con-
sultations about it; but that having neither vessel,
nor tools to build one, or provisions of any
kind, their counsels always ended in tears and
despair. - - -
I asked him, how he thought they would receive
a proposal from me, which might tend towards an
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no
inherent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they
had received, so much as they did by the advan-
tages they expected. I told him, it would be very
hard, that I should be the instrument of their deli-
verance, and that they should afterwards make me
their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman
was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity,
or what accident soever, brought him thither; and
that I had rather be delivered up to the savages,
and be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless
claws of the priests, and be carried into the inqui-
sition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded,
if they were all here, we might, with so many
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all
away either to the Brasils southward, or to the
islands or Spanish coast northward: but that if in
requital they should, when I had put weapons into
their hands, carry me by force among their own
people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them,
and make my case worse than it was before.
He answered, with a great deal of candour and
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable,
z 3
and they were so sensible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the thought of using any man
unkindly that should contribute to their deliver-
ance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them
with the old man, and discourse with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their answer:
that he would make conditions with them upon
their solemn oath, that they would be absolutely
under my leading, as their commander and captain;
and that they should swear upon the holy sacra-
ments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to such
christian country as I should agree to, and no
other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely
by my orders, till they were landed safely in such
country as I intended; and that he would bring a
contract from them under their hands for that
purpose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me
himself, that he would never stir from me as long
as he lived, till I gave him order; and that he
would take my side to the last drop of blood, if
there should happen the least breach of faith among
his countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil
honest men, and they were under the greatest dis-
tress imaginable, having neither weapons or clothes,
nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of
the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to
their own country; and that he was sure, if I
would undertake their relief, they would live and
die by me.
/
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had
so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice,
put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least
half a year. The case was thus:
He had been with us now about a month; dur-
ing which time I had let him see in what manner
I had provided, with the assistance of Providence,
for my support; and he saw evidently what stock
of corn and rice I had lain up; which, as it was
more than sufficient for myself, so it was not suf.
ficient, at least without good husbandry, for my
family, now it was increased to number four: but
much less would it be sufficient, if his country-
men, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive,
should come over; and least of all would it be suf-
ficient to victual our vessel, if we should build
one, for a voyage to any of the christian colonies
of America. So he told me, he thought it would
be more adviseable, to let him and the other two
dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I
could spare seed to sow; and that we should wait
another harvest, that we might have a supply of
corn for his countrymen when they should come ;
for want might be a temptation to them to disa-
gree, or not to think themselves delivered, other-
Z 4
wise than out of one difficulty into another. You
know, says he, the children of Israel, though they
rejoiced at first at their being delivered out of
Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself, that
delivered them, when they came to want bread in
the wilderness. -
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased
with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with
his fidelity: so we fell to digging, all four of us,
as well as the wooden tools we were furnished
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by
the end of which it was seed-time, we had gotten
as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed
twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars
of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had
to spare ; nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley
sufficient for our own food for the six months that
we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckoning
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for
it is not to be supposed it is six months in the
ground in that country. -
Having now society enough, and our number
being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages,
if they had come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island,
wherever we found occasion ; and as here we had
our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it
was impossible, at least for me, to have the means
of it out of mine; to this purpose, I marked out
several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and
I set Friday and his father to cutting them down;
and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I im-
parted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and
direct their work: I shewed them with what inde-
fatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single
planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they
had made about a dozen large planks of good oak,
near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from
two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious
labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time I contrived to increase my
little flock of tame goats as much as I could; and
to this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard to
go out one day, and myself, with Friday, the next
day, for we took our turns: and by this means we
got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest: for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the
kids, and added them to our flock: but, above all,
the season for curing the grapes coming on, I
caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up
in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant,
where the raisins of the sun are cured, we should
have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with
our bread, was a great part of our food, and very
good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceed-
ing nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order:
it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen
in the island, but, however, it was enough to an-
swer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of
barley, we brought in and threshed out above two
hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in pro-
portion of the rice, which was store enough for
our food to the next harvest, though all the six-
teen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if
we had been ready for a voyage, it would very
plentifully have victualled our ship, to have car-
ried us to any part of the world, that is to say, of
America. When we had thus housed and secured
our magazine of corn, we fell to work, to make
more wicker-work; viz. great baskets, in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that
I did not make some things for defence of this
kind of work: but I saw no need of it. And now,
having a full supply of food for all the guests ex-
pected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to
the main, to see what he could do with those he
left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge
in writing not to bring any man with him, who
would not first swear, in the presence of himself
and of the old savage, that he would no way in-
jure, fight with, or attack the person he should
find in the island, who was so kind to send for
them in order to their deliverance; but that they
would stand by and defend him against all such
attempts; and wherever they went, would be en-
tirely under, and subjected to his command; and
that this should be put in writing, and signed with
their hands: how we were to have this done, when
I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed
was a question which we never asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage (the father of Friday) went away in
one of the canoes, which they might be said to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
prisoners to be devoured by the savages.
I gave each of them a musket with a firelock
on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of both,
and not to use either of them but upon urgent oc-
casions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first mea-
sures used by me in view of my deliverance for
now 27 years and some days; I gave them provi-,
sions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for their
countrymen for about eight days time; and wish-
ing them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing
with them about a signal they should hang out at
their return, by which I should know them again,
when they came back, at a distance, before they
came on shore.
They went away with a fair gale on the day
that the moon was at the full; by my account in
the month of October; but as for the exact reck-
oning of days, after I had once lost it, I could
never recover it again; nor had I kept even the
number of years so punctually, as to be sure that
I was right, though, as it proved when I after-
wards examined my account, I found I had kept
a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of
in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one
morning, when my man Friday came running in
to me, and called aloud, Master, master, they are
come, they are come.
... I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went
out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through
my little grove, which (by the way) was by this
time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, re-
gardless of danger, I went without my arms, which
was not my custom to do; but I was surprised,
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw
a boat at about a league and a half’s distance,
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder of mutton
sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty
fair to bring them in ; also I observed presently,
that they did not come from that side which the
shore lay on, but from the southermost end of the
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him
lie close, for these were not the people we looked
for, and that we did not know yet whether they
were friends or enemies.
. . In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec-
tive glass, to see what I could make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre-
hensive of any thing, and to take my view the
plainer without being discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor,
at about two leagues and a half’s distance from
me, S. S. E., but not above a league and a half
from the shore. By my observation it appeared
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appear-
ed to be an English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had rea-
son to believe was manned by my own country-
men, and consequently friends, was such as I can-
not describe; but yet I had some secret doubts
hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they
came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the
first place it occurred to me to consider what busi-
ness an English ship could have in that part of the
world; since it was not the way to or from any
part of the world where the English had any traf.
fick; and I knew there had been no storms to drive
them in there, as in distress; and if they were
English really, it was most probable that they
were here upon no good design; and that I had
better continue as I was, than fall into the hands
of thieves and murderers. - -
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices
of danger, which sometimes are given him when
he may think there is no possibility of its being
real. That such hints and notices are given us,
I believe few that have made any observations of
things can deny ; that they are certain discoveries
of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems
to be to warn us of danger, why should we not
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whe-
ther supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not
the question), and that they are given for our
good? *
The present question abundantly confirms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been
made cautious by this secret admonition, come
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably,
and in a far worse condition than before, as you will
see presently.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of
landing; however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I
formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on
shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from
me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise
they would have landed just, as I may say, at my
door, and would have soon beaten me out of my
castle, and perhaps, have plundered me of all I
had.
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one
or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three
of them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them
were jumped on shore, they took those three out
of the boat as prisoners. One of the three I could
perceive using the most passionate gestures of en-
treaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of
extravagance; the other two, I could perceive,
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared con-
cerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the
first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and
knew not what the meaning of it should be. Fri-
day called out to me in English, as well as he could,
O master! you see English mans eat prisoners as
well as savage mans. Why, said I, Friday, do you
think they are going to eat them then * Yes, says
Friday, they will eat them. No, no, said I, Fri-
day; I am afraid they will murder them indeed;
but you may be sure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the mat-
ter really was, but stood trembling with horror
of the sight, expecting every moment when the
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw
one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cut-
las (as the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one
of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall
every moment, at which all the blood in my body
seemed to run chill in my veins.
I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that I might have rescued the three men;
for I saw no fire-arms they had among them; but
it fell out to my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of
the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed
the fellows ran scattering about the land, as if
they wanted to see the country. I observed also,
that the three other men had liberty to go where
they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground very pensive, and looked like men in despair.
This put me in mind of the first time when I
came on shore, and began to look about me; how
I gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked
round me, what dreadful apprehensions I had, and
how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being
devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I
was to receive by the providential driving of
the ship nearer the land, by the storms and tides
by which I have since been so long nourished and
supported; so these three poor desolate men knew
nothing how certain of deliverance and supply
they were, how near it was to them, and how ef.
fectually and really they were in a condition of
safety, at the same time they thought themselves
lost, and their case desperate. -
So little do we see before us in the world, and
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon
the great Maker of the world, that he does not
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that
in the worst circumstances they have always some-
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are
even brought to their deliverance by the means
by which they seem to be brought to their de-
struction.
. It was just at the top of high-water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parlying with the prisoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to see what kind
of place they were in, they had carelessly staid till
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed con-
siderably away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too
fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the
rest who were straggling about, upon which they
all soon came to the boat; but it was past all their
strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft oosy sand,
almost like a quicksand. . . .
. In this condition, like true seamen, who are,
perhaps, the least of all mankind given to fore-
thought, they gave it over, and away they strolled
about the country again; and I heard one of them
say aloud to another (calling them off from the
boat), Why let her alone, Jack, can’t ye 2 she'll
float next tide. By which I was fully confirmed in
the main inquiry, of what countrymen they were.
... All this while I kept myself close, not once dar-
ing to stir out of my castle, any further than to
my place of observation, near the top of the hill;
and very glad I was, to think how well it was for-
tified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be-
fore the boat could be on float again, and by that
VOL. I. A A
time it would be dark, and I might be more at li-
berty to see their motions, and to hear their dis-
course, if they had any.
In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I
had to do with another kind of enemy than I had
at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made
an excellent marksman with his gun, to load him-
self with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces,
and I gave him three musquets: my figure, indeed,
was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin
coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a naked
sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon
each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have
made any attempt till it was dark; but about two
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in
short they were all gone straggling into the woods,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep; the
three poor distressed men too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, were however set down
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quar-
ter of a mile from me, and as I thought, out of
sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immedi-
ately I marched in the figure above, my man Fri-
day at a good distance behind me, as formidable
for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring
a spectre-like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could,
and then, before any of them saw me, I called
aloud to them in Spanish, What are ye, Gentle-
men P
They started up at the noise; but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the un-
couth figure that I made: they made no answer
at all, but I thought I perceived them just going
to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.
Gentlemen, said I, do not be surprised at me; per-
haps you may have a friend near you, when you
did not expect it. He must be sent directly from
Heaven then, said one of them very gravely to
me, pulling off his hat at the same time, for our
condition is past the help of man. All help is from
Heaven, Sir, said I: but can you put a stranger in
the way how to help you? for you seem to me
to be in some great distress. I saw you when you
landed; and when you seemed to make application
to the brutes that came with you—I saw one of
them lift up his sword to kill you.
The poor man with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, re-
turned, Am I talking to GoD or man? Is it a real-
man, or an angel? Be in no fear about that, Sir,
said I: if God had sent an angel to relieve you,
he would have come better clothed, and armed
after another manner than you see me in ; pray
lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman,
and disposed to assist you; you see I have one ser-
vant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us
freely, Can we serve you? What is your case ?
A A 2
Our case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near; but in short, Sir,
I was commander of that ship; my men having
mutinied against me, they have been hardly pre-
vailed on not to murder me, and at last have set
me on shore in this desolate place, with these two,
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger;
where we expected to perish, believing the place
to be uninhabited, and know not what to think of it.
Where are those brutes, your enemies? said I:
Do you know where they are gone? There they
are, Sir, said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; my
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and
heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly
murder us all, - -
Have they any fire arms 2 said I: he answered,
they had only two pieces, and one which they left
in the boat. Well then, said I, leave the rest to
me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing
to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them
prisoners? He told me there were two desperate
villains among them, that it was scarce safe to
shew any mercy to ; but if they were secured, he
believed all the rest would return to their duty.
I asked him, Which they were 2 He told me, he
could not at that distance describe them; but he
would obey my orders in any thing I would
direct. Well, said I, let us retreat out of their
view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will
resolve farther; so they willingly went back with
me, till the woods covered us from them.
Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two condi-
tions with me? He anticipated my proposals, by
telling me, that both he and the ship, if recovered,
should be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thing; and if the ship was not recovered,
he would live and die with me in what part of the
world soever I would send him ; and the two other
men said the same. - -
Well, said I, my conditions are but two: 1.
That while you stay on this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I
put arms into your hands, you will upon all occa-
sions give them up to me, and do no prejudice to
me or mine, upon this island, and in the mean
time to be governed by my orders.
2. That if the ship is, or may be recovered, you
will carry me and my man to England, passage
free.
He gave me all the assurance that the invention
and faith of a man could devise, that he would
comply with these most reasonable demands; and
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all occasions as long as he lived. -
Well then, said I, here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done: he shewed all the tes-
timony of his gratitude that he was able; but of.
fered to be wholly guided by me: I told him, I
thought it was hard venturing anything; but the
best method I could think of, was to fire upon
A A 3
358 LIFE AND Adventures
them at once, as they lay; and if any were not
killed at the first volley, and offered to submit,
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon
God’s providence to direct the shot.
He said, very modestly, that he was loth to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of
all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped,
we should be undone still: for they would go on
board, and bring the whole ship's company, and
destroy us all. Well then, said I, necessity legiti-
mates my advice; for it is the only way to save
our lives. However, seeing him still cautious of
shedding blood, I told him, they should go them-
selves, and manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some
of them awake, and soon after we saw two of them
on their feet. I asked him, If either of them were
the men who he had said were the heads of the
mutiny? He said No. Well then, said I, you may
let them escape, and Providence seems to have
wakened them on purpose to save themselves:
Now, said I, if the rest escape you, it is your
fault.
Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece
in his hand : the two men, who were with him,
going first, made some noise, at which one of the
seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too
late then; for the moment he cried out, they fired,
I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving
his own piece: they had so well aimed their shot
at the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and
called eagerly for help to the other; but the cap-
tain, stepping to him, told him it was too late to
cry for help ; he should call upon GoD to forgive
his villainy; and with that word knocked him
down with the stock of his musket, so that he
never spoke more : there were three more in the
company, and one of them was also slightly
wounded; by this time I was come; and when
they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to
resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told
them he would spare their lives, if they would
give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the
treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear
to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and
afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the pro-
testations of their sincerity that could be desired;
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their
lives, which I was not against; only I obliged him
to keep them bound hand and foot while they were
upon the island,
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure
her, and bring away the oars and sail, which they
did; and by and bye, three straggling men, that
A A 4
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came
back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their
captain, who before was their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also, and
so our victory was complete. -
. . It now remained, that the captain and I should
inquire into one another’s circumstances. I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of won-
ders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to
have been preserved there on purpose to save his
life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not
speak a word more. . . .
After this communication was at an end, I car-
ried him and his two men into my apartments,
leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the
top of the house; where I refreshed them with
‘such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the
contrivances I had made during my long, long in-
habiting that place. -
All I shewed them, all I said to them, was per-
fectly amazing; but above all, the captain admired
my fortification; and how perfectly I had con-
cealed my retreat with a grove of the trees, which,
having now been planted near twenty years, and
the trees growing much faster than in England, was
become a little wood, and so thick, that it was un-
passable in any part of it, but at that one side where
I had reserved my little winding passage into it:
this I told him was my castle, and my residence;
but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I
would shew him that too another time; but at pre-
sent our business was to consider how to recover
the ship. He agreed with me as to that ; but told
me, he was perfectly at a loss what measure to take;
for that there were still six-and-twenty hands on
board, who having entered into a cursed conspi-
racy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to
the law, would be hardened in it now by despera-
tion; and would carry it on, knowing that if they
were reduced, they should be brought to the gal-
lows as soon as they came to England, or to any
of the English colonies; and that therefore there
would be no attacking them with so small a num-
ber as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said,
and found it was a very rational conclusion, and
that therefore something was to be resolved on
very speedily, as well to draw the men on board
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent
their landing upon us, and destroying us; upon
this it presently occurred to me, that in a little
while, the ship's crew, wondering what was be.
come of their comrades, and of the boat, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat to see
for them; and that then perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed
was rational.
Upon this I told him, the first thing we were to
do, was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach,
so that they might not carry her off; and taking
every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as
not to be fit to swim; accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out
of her, and whatever else we found there, which
was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few
biscuit cakes, an horn of powder, and a great lump
of sugar in a piece of canvass; the sugar was five or
six pounds; all which was very welcome to me,
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had
had none left for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were
carried before, as above), we knocked a great hole
in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough
to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry us
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
friends the Spaniards in my way; for I had them
still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up
upon the beach, so high that the tide would not
float her off at high-water mark; and, besides,
had broken an hole in her bottom, too big to be
quickly stopped, and were sat down musing what
we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and
saw her make a waft with her ancient, as a signal
for the boat to come on board; but no boat stirred;
and they fired several times, making other signals
for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another
boat out, and row towards the shore; and we
found, as they approached, that there were no less
than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms
with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the
shore, we had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces;
because the tide having set them a little to the east
of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to
come to the same place where the other had landed,
and where the boat lay.
By this means, Isay, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of
all the men in the boat; of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure,
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being
overpowered and frighted.
But that for the boatswain, who, it seems, was
the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they
were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew ; and
were, no doubt, made desperate in their new enter-
prize; and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our
circumstances were past the operations of fear:
that seeing almost every condition that could be
was better than that we were supposed to be in, we
ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I
asked him, what he thought of the circumstances of
my life, and whether a deliverance was not worth
venturing for 2 And where, Sir, said I, is your be-
lief of my being preserved here on purpose to save
your life, which elevated you a little while ago?
For my part, said I, there seems to be but one thing
amiss in all the prospect of it. What is that? says
he. Why, said I, it is that, as you say, there are
three or four honest fellows among them, which
should be spared; had they been all of the wicked
part of the crew, I should have thought GoD's pro-
vidence had singled them out to deliver them into
your hands; for, depend upon it, every man of
them that comes ashore are our own, and shall die
or live, as they behave to us.
As I spoke this with a raised voice, and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him;
so we set vigorously to our business: we had, upon
the first appearance of the boat’s coming from the
ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and
had indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less as-
sured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one
of the three (delivered men) to my cave, where
they were remote enough, and out of danger of
being heard or discovered, or of finding their way
out of the woods, if they could have delivered them-
selves: here they left them bound, but gave them
provisions, and promised them, if they continued
there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or
two; but that if they attempted their escape, they
should be put to death without mercy. . They pro-
mised faithfully to bear their confinement with pa-
tience, and were very thankful that they had such
good usage as to have provisions, and a light left
them ; for Friday gave them candles (such as we
made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did
not know but that he stood centinel over them at
the entrance. - -
The other prisoners had better usage; two of
them were kept pinioned indeed, because the cap-
tain was not free to trust them ; but the other two
were taken into my service upon their captain's
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging
to live and die with us; so, with them and the
three honest men, we were seven men well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal
well enough with the ten that were coming, con-
sidering that the captain had said, there were three
or four honest men among them also. *
As soon as they got to the place where their
other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach,
and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the boat at an anchor,
some distance from the shore, with some hands in
her to guard her; and so we should not be able to
seize the boat.
Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they
were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
her bottom. -
After they had mused a while upon this, they
set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all
their might, to try if they could make their compa-
nions hear; but all was to no purpose; then they
came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their
small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring; but it was all one; those in
the cave, we were sure, could not hear; and those
in our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
yet durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to
go all on board again to their ship, and let them
know there, that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immedi-
ately launched the boat again, and got all of them
on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
up for lost, and so he should still lose the ship,
which he was in hopes we should have recovered;
but he was quickly as much frighted the other
way.
They had not been long put off with the boat,
but we perceived them all coming on shore again;
but with this new measure in their conduct,
which, it seems, they consulted together upon, viz.
to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go
on shore, and go up into the country to look for
their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now
we were at a loss what to do ; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if
we let the boat escape, because they would then
row away to the ship; and then the rest of them
would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our
recovering the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present: the seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained
in the boat put her off to a good distance from the
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them ; so
that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us: we
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them;
or that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the
hill, where they could see a great way in the
valley and woods, which lay towards the north-
east part, and where the island lay lowest, they
shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore,
nor far from one another, they sat down together
under a tree, to consider of it: had they thought
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of
them had done, they had done the job for us; but
they were too full of apprehensions of danger to
venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell
what the danger was they had to fear neither. .
The captain made a very just proposal to me
upon this consultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to
make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally
upon them, just at the juncture when their pieces
were all discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I
liked the proposal, provided it was done while we
were near enough to come up to them, before they
could load their pieces again. - -
But this event did not happen, and we lay still
a long time, very irresolute what course to take; at
length I told them, there would be nothing to be
done in my opinion till night; and then, if they
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so
might use some stratagem with them in the boat, to
get them on shore.
: We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy: when,
after long consultations, we saw them start all up,
and march down toward the sea: it seems, they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on
board the ship again, give their companions over for
lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with
the ship. - - -
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was ; that they had
given over their search, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions
of it; but I presently thought of a stratagem to
fetch them back again, and which answered my end
to a tittle. , • * : . . .”
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued; and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground, at about half a mile's distance, Ibade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever
they heard the seamen answer them, they should
return it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take
a round, always answering when the others hal-
looed, to draw them as far into the island, and
among the woods, as possible, and then wheel about
again to me, by such ways as I directed. . . *
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering ran along the shore westward
VOL. I. B B
towards the voice they heard, when they were
presently stopped by the creek, where, the water
being up, they could not get over, and called for
the boat to come up, and set them over, as indeed
I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone up a good way into the
creek, and as it were in an harbour within the
land, they took one of the three men out of her to
go along with them, and left only two in the boat,
having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on
the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain’s mate to their bu-
siness, I took the rest with me, and, crossing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men
before they were aware, one of them lying on
shore, and the other being in the boat; the fellow
on shore was between sleeping and waking, and
going to start up, the captain, who was foremost,
ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and then
called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a
dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon
him, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this
was, it seems, one of the three that were not so
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield,
but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and from one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach
back to the boat before it was dark; and indeed
they were heartily tired themselves also by the time
they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make
sure work with them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to
me before they came back to their boat; and we
could hear the foremost of them, long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along ; and could also hear them answer, and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not being
able to come any faster, which was very welcome
neVS to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion, when they
found the boat fast a-ground in the creek. The
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone; we could
hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into
an enchanted island; that either there were inha-
bitants in it, and they should all be murdered; or
else there were devils or spirits in it, and they should
be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no
B B 2
answer: after some time, we could see them, by
the little light there was, run about wringing their
hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest
themselves, then come ashore, and walk about
again, and so the same thing over again.
My men would fain have had me give them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was
willing to take them at some advantage, so to spare
them, and kill as few of them as I could ; and es-
pecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any
of our men, knowing the other men were very well
armed : I resolved to wait to see if they did not
separate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I
drew my ambuscade nearer; and ordered Friday
and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet
as close to the ground as they could, that they
might not be discovered, and get as near them as
they could possibly, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, till the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most de-
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them with two more of the crew; the cap-
tain was so eager, at having the principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have pa-
tience to let him come so near as to be sure of him;
for they only heard his tongue before : but when
they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting
up on their feet, let fly at them. -
. The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and
the third ran for it. -
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men;
viz. myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-
general; the captain and his two men, and the
three prisoners of war, whom he had trusted with
armS. -
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the
man they had left in the boat, who was now one
of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce
them to terms; which fell out just as we desired;
for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition
then was, they would be very willing to capitulate;
so he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them,
Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Tom Smith answered
immediately, Who's that! Robinson | For it seems
he knew his voice. The other answered, Ay, ay;
for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms,
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment.
Who must we yield to 2 Where are they 2 says
Smith again. Here they are, says he here is our
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting
you this two hours; the boatswain is killed; Will
Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you
do not yield, you are all lost. - -- .
Will they give us quarter then? says Tom Smith,
and we will yield. I’ll go and ask, if you promise
B B 3
to yield, says Robinson. So he asked the captain,
and the captain himself then calls out; You, Smith,
you know my voice, if you lay down your arms im-
mediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all
but Will Atkins.
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For God’s sake,
captain, give me quarter: what have I done? they
have been all as bad as I: (which by the way was
not true, either; for it seems this Will Atkins was
the first man that laid hold of the captain when
they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injurious language:)
however, the captain told him he must lay down
his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's
mercy, by which he meant me; for they all called
me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parlied with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,
particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated
with them upon the villainy of their practices with
him, and at length, upon the further wickedness of
their design; and how certainly it must bring them
to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the
gallows. - -
They all appeared very penitent, and begged
hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they
were none of his prisoners, but the commander's
of the island; that they thought they had set him
on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it
had pleased GoD so to direct them, that the island
was inhabited, and that the governor was an En-
glishman; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter,
he supposed he would send them to England, to
be dealt with there as justice required, except At-
kins, whom he was commanded by the governor to
advise to prepare for death; for that he would be
hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it
had its desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees
to beg the captain to intercede with the governor
for his life; and all the rest begged of him for
GoD's sake, that they might not be sent to
England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our de-
liverance was come, and that it would be a most
easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in
getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the
dark from them, that they might not see what kind
of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me; when I called, as at a good distance, one of
the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the
captain, Captain, the commander calls for you;
and presently the captain replied, Tell his excel-
lency I am just a coming. This more perfectly
*
B B 4
amused them; and they all believed, that the com-
mander was just by with his fifty men. ". . . . ;
. Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the
next morning. - . . . .
But, in order to execute it with more art, and to
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins,
and two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was
committed to Friday, and the two men who came
on shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition. - - -
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called
it, of which I have given a full description; and
as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place
was secure enough, considering they were upon
their behaviour. ~ --
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word,
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might be trusted or no, to go on board, and sur-
prise the ship : he talked to them of the injury
done him, of the condition they were brought to:
and that though the governor had given them
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet
that if they were sent to England, they would all
be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they
would join in such an attempt, as to recover the
ship, he would have the governor’s engagement for
their pardon. -
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop of blood,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and
would go with him all over the world; that they
would own him for a father to them as long as they
lived.
Well, says the captain, I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it: so he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in, and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back again, and choose out five
of them, and tell them, that they should see that
they did not want men; but he would take out
those five to be his assistants, and that the governor
would keep the other two, and the three that were
sent prisoners to the castle, (my cave) as hostages,
for the fidelity of those five; and that if they
proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hos-
tages should be hanged in chains alive upon the
shore. -
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest; however, they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain,
to persuade the other five to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expe-
dition. 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger.
2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to
whom, having their characters from the captain, I
had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms.
8. The other two whom I kept till now in my bower
pinioned; but, upon the captain’s motion, had now
released. 4. These five released at last ; so that
they were twelve in all, besides five we kept pri-
soners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship : for, as for me
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and
it was employment enough for us to keep them
asunder, and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep
them fast; but Friday went twice a day to them,
to supply them with necessaries; and I made the
other two carry provisions to a certain distance,
where Friday was to take it.
When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it
was with the captain, who told them, I was the
person the governor had ordered to look after
them, and that it was the governor’s pleasure that
they should not stir any where but by my direc-
tion; that if they did, they should be fetched into
the castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never
suffered them to see me as governor, so I now
appeared as another person, and spoke of the go-
vernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon
all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him,
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of
one, and man them : he made his passenger cap-
tain of one, with four other men; and himself, and
his mate, and five more, went in the other; and
they contrived their business very well; for they
came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as
they came within call of the ship, he made Robin-
son hail them, and tell them he had brought off
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time
before they had found them, and the like ; holding
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side;
when the captain and the mate, entering first with
their arms, immediately knocked down the second
mate and carpenter with the butt end of their mus-
quets, being very faithfully seconded by their men;
they secured all the rest that were upon the main
and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches
to keep them down who were below, when the
other boat, and their men, entering at the fore-
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
skuttle which went down into the cook-room,
making three men they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate with three men to
break into the round house, where the new rebel
captain lay, and, having taken the alarm, was got-
ten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten
fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate with
a crow split open the door, the new captain and
his men fired boldly among them, and wounded
the mate with a musquet ball, which broke his
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but
killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however,
into the round-house, wounded as he was, and
with his pistol shot the new captain through the
head, the bullets entering at his mouth, and came
out again behind one of his ears; so that he never
spoke a word; upon which the rest yielded, and
the ship was taken effectually, without any more
lives being lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the sig-
nal agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his
success; which you may be sure I was very glad
to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it
till near two of the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue
to me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur-
prised with the noise of a gun; and presently
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name
of Governor, governor; and presently I knew
the captain's voice, when climbing up to the top
of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship
he embraced me in his arms. My dear friend
and deliverer, says he, there is your ship, for she
is all your's, and so are we, and all that belong to
her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within a little more than half a mile of the
shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her; and the weather be-
ing fair, had brought her to an anchor just against
the mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up,
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the
place where I first landed my rafts, and so landed
just at my door. -
I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise: for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship
just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to
go. At first, for some time, I was not able to an-
swer one word; but as he had taken me in his
arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen
to the ground. - 2
He perceived the surprise, and immediately
pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a
dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose
for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the
ground, and though it brought me to myself, yet
it was a good while before I could speak a word to
him. - - -
All this while the poor man was in as great an
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I
was ; and he said a thousand kind tender things
to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but
such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put
all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke into
tears, and in a little while after I recovered my
speech.
Then I took my turn and embraced him as my
deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him,
I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as
these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evi-
dence, that the eyes of an infinite power could
search into the remotest corner of the world, and
send help to the miserable whenever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness
to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless
Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner
provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such
a desolate condition, but from whom every deli-
verance must always be acknowledged to pro-
ceed
When we had talked awhile, the captain told
me, he had brought me some little refreshments,
such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches,
who had been so long his masters, had not plun-
dered him of: upon this he called aloud to the boat,
and bids his men bring the things ashore that were
for the governor; and indeed it was a present as
if I had been one, not that I was to be carried
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the island still, and they were to go without
IIle.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full
of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of
Madeira wine; the bottles held two quarts a piece;
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of
pork, with a bag of peas, and about an hundred
weight of biscuit.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of
flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of
lime-juice, and abundance of other things: but be-
sides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts,
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one
pair of shoes, an hat, and one pair of stockings,
and a very good suit of clothes of his own, which
had been worn but very little : in a word, he
clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine to one in my circumstances;
but never was any thing in the world of that kind
so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to
me to wear such clothes at their first putting on.
After these ceremonies passed, and after all his
good things were brought into my little apart-
ment, we began to consult what was to be done
with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con-
sidering whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom
we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
last degree; and the captain said, he knew they
were such rogues, that there was no obliging
them; and if he did carry them away it must be
in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to
justice at the first English colony he could come
at; and I found that the captain himself was very
anxious about it. -
Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of,
to make it their own request that he should leave
them upon the island. I should be very glad of
that, says the captain, with all my heart. - -
Well, said I, I will send for them, and talk with
them for you : so I caused Friday and the two
hostages, for they were now discharged, their
comrades having performed their promise; I say,
I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the
five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and
keep them there till I came. - -
After some time, I came thither dressed in my
new habit, and now I was called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused
the men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full account of their villainous beha-
viour to the captain, and how they had run away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit fur-
ther robberies; but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my direction the ship
had been seized, that she lay now in the road,
and they might see by and by, that their new
captain had received the reward of his villainy;
*
for that they might see him hanging at the
yard arm. .
That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to say, why I should not execute them as pi-
rates taken in the fact, as by my commission they
could not doubt I had authority to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest,
that they had nothing to say but this, That when
they were taken, the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy: but I
told them I knew not what mercy to shew them;
for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the
captain to go for England: and as for the captain,
he could not carry them to England, other than
as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and
running away with the ship; the consequence of
which, they must needs know, would be the gal-
lows: so that I could not tell which was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island: if they desired that, I did not care, as
I had liberty to leave it; I had some inclination
to give them their lives, if they thought they
could shift on shore. They seemed very thank-
ful for it; said they would much rather venture to
stay there, than to be carried to England to be
hanged: so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some
difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them there:
upon this I seemed to be a little angry with the
captain, and told him, that they were my prisoners,
VOL. I. C C - -
not his ; and that seeing I had offered them so
much favour, I would be as good as my word;
and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I
would set them at liberty as I found them; and if
he did not like that, he might take them again, if
he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them
retire into the woods, to the place whence they
came, and I would leave them some fire-arms,
some ammunition, and some directions how they
should live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship;
but told the captain, that I would stay that night
to prepare my things; and desired him to go on
board in the meantime, and keep all right in the
ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for
me; ordering him, in the meantime, to cause the
new captain who was killed, to be hanged at the
yard-arm, that these men might see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men
up to me to my apartment, and entered seriously
into discourse with them of their circumstances.
I told them, I thought they had made a right
choice; that if the captain carried them away,
they would certainly be hanged. I shewed them
their captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship,
and told them they had nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them, I would let them into the
story of my living there, and put them into the
way of making it easy to them: accordingly I gave
them the whole history of the place, and of my
coming to it; shewed them my fortifications, the
way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my
grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to
make them easy. I told them the story of the
sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected; for
whom I left a letter, and made them promise to
treat them in common with themselves.
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five musquets,
three fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had
about a barrel of powder left; for after the first
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I
gave them a description of the way I managed the
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to
make both butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them, I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
more, and some garden-seed, which I told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave them
the bag of peas which the captain had brought me
to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase
them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day,
and went on board the ship; we prepared imme-
diately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The
next morning early, two of the five men came
swimming to the ship's side, and making a most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged
to be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they
C C 2
should be murdered; and begged the captain to
take them on board, though he hanged them im-
mediately. *
Upon this the captain pretended to have no
power without me; but after some difficulty, and
after their solemn promises of amendment, they
were taken on board, and were some time after
soundly whipped and pickled; after which they
proved very honest and quiet fellows. .
Some time after this, I went with the boat on
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised
to the men, to which the captain, at my interces-
sion, caused their chests and clothes to be added,
which they took, and were very thankful for... I
also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it
lay in my way to send a vessel to take them h, I
would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on
board for reliques the great goat's-skin cap I had
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned,
which had lain by me so long useless that it was
grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and
handled; and also the money I found in the
wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island the nineteenth of De-
cember, as I found by the ship's account, in the
year 1686, after I had been upon it eight and
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days;
being delivered from the second captivity the same
day of the month that I first made my escape in
the Barco-longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687,
having been thirty and five years absent.
When I came to England, I was a perfect
stranger to all the world, as if I had never been
known there: my benefactor, and faithful steward,
whom I had left in trust with my money, was
alive but had had great misfortunes in the world,
was become a widow the second time, and very low
in the world. I made her easy as to what she
owed me, assuring her, I would give her no trouble;
but on the contrary, in gratitude to her former
care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my
little stock would afford, which at that time would
indeed allow me to do but little for her: but I
assured her, I would never forget her former
kindness to me; nor did I forget her, when I
had sufficient to help her; as shall be observed in
its place.
: I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the fa-
mily extinct; except that I found two sisters, and
two of the children of one of my brothers: and as
I had been long ago given over for dead, there
had been no provision made for me, so that, in a
word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and
that little money I had, would not do so much for
me as to settling in the world. * .
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which
C C 3
I did not expect; and this was, that the master of
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by
the same means saved the ship and cargo, having
given a very handsome account to the owners of
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men,
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and
some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a very handsome compliment upon that
subject, and a present of almost two hundred
pounds sterling. -
But after making several reflections upon the
circumstances of my life, and how little way this
would go towards settling me in the world, I re-
solved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not
come by some information of the state of my plan-
tation in the Brasils, and what was become of my
partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some
years now given me over for dead.
With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following; my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all these ram-
blings, and proving a most faithful servant upon
all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by in-
quiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old
friend, the captain of the ship, who first took me
up at sea, off the shore of Africa: he was now
grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his.
son, who was far from a young man, into his ship;
and who still used the Brasil trade. The old man
did not know me, and indeed, I hardly knew him;
but I soon brought myself to his remembrance,
when I told him who I was. -
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation, and my partner. The old man told me,
he had not been in the Brasils for about nine
years; but that he could assure me, that when he
came away my partner was living; but the trus-
tees, whom I had joined with him, to take cogni-
zance of my part, were both dead; that, however,
he believed that I would have a very good account
of the improvement of the plantation; for that,
upon the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of
the produce of my part of the plantation to the
procurator fiscal; who had appropriated it, in case
I never came to claim it, one third to the King,
and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine,
to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for
the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith;
but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim
the inheritance, it would be restored; only that
the improvement, or annual production, being dis-
tributed to charitable uses, could not be restored ;
but he assured me, that the steward of the king's
revenue (from lands) and the provedore, or steward
of the monastery, had taken great care all along,
that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner,
gave every year a faithful account of the produce,
of which they received duly my moiety.
I asked him, if he knew to what height of im-
C C 4
provement he had brought the plantation: and
whether he thought it might be worth looking
after; or whether, on my going thither, I should
meet yith no obstruction to my possessing my just
right in the moiety.
He told me, he could not tell exactly to what
degree the plantation was improved; but this he
knew, that my partner was growing exceeding
rich upon the enjoying but one half of it! and
that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard
that the king's third of my part, which was, it
seems, granted away to some other monastery, or
religious house, amounted to above two hundred
moidores a year; that, as to my being restored to
a quiet possession of it, there was no question to
be made of that, my partner being alive to witness
my title, and my name being also inrolled in the
register of the country. Also he told me, that
the survivors of my two trustees were very fair,
honest people, and very wealthy, and he believed
I would not only have their assistance for putting
me in possession, but would find a very consider-
able sum of money in their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm, while their fathers
held the trust, and before it was given up as
above, which, as he remembered, was about twelve
years.
I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy
at this account, and inquired of the old captain,
how it came to pass, that the trustees should thus
dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had
made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese
captain, my universal heir, &c. -
He told me, that was true; but that, as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exe-
cutor, until some certain account should come of
my death; and that, besides, he was not willing to
intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was
true, he had registered my will, and put in his
claim ; and could he have given any account of
my being dead or alive, he would have acted by
procuration, and taken possession of the Ingenio
(so they called the sugar-house) and had given his
son, who was now at the Brasils, order to do it. .
But, (says the old man) I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so
acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that
believing you were lost, and all the world believ
ing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to
account to me in your name, for six or eight of
the first years of profit, which I received; but
there being at that time, says he, great disburse-
ments for increasing the works, building an inge-
nio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near
so much as afterwards it produced: however, says
the old man, I shall give you a true account of
what I have received in all, and how I have dis-
posed of it.
After a few days further conference with this
ancient friend, he brought me an account of the
six first years income of my plantation, signed by
my partner, and the merchant's trustees, being
always delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll,
and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c.
which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I
found by this account, that every year the income
considerably increased: but, as above, the disburse-
ment being large, the sum at first was small: how-
ever, the old man let me see, that he was debtor
to me 470 moidores of gold, besides 60 chests of
sugar, and 15 double rolls of tobacco, which were
lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming
home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leav-
ing the place.
The good man then began to complain of his
misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make
use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him
a sharein a new ship; — However, my old friend,
says he, you shall not want a supply in your ne-
cessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall
be fully satisfied.
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives
me two hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and
giving me the writings of his title to the ship
which his son was gone to the Brasils in, of which
he was a quarter part owner, and his son another,
he put them both in my hands for security of the
rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and
kindness of the poor man to be able to bear this;
and remembering what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at sea, and how generously
he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he said to me.
Therefore, first I asked him if his circumstances
admitted him to spare so much money at that time,
and if it would not straiten him P. He told me he
could not say but it might straiten him a little;
but, however, it was my money, and I might want
it more than he.
Every thing the good man said was full of affec-
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while
he spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the
moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him
a receipt for them; then I returned him the rest,
and told him, if ever I had possession of the plan-
tation, I would return the other to him also, as
indeed I afterwards did : and that, as to the bill
of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not
take it by any means; but that if I wanted the
money, I found he was honest enough to pay me;
and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave
me reason to expect, I would never have a penny
more from him.
When this was passed, the old man began to ask
me if he should put me in a method to make my
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself. He said, I might do so if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to
appropriate the profits to my use; and as there
were ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go
away to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a
public register, with his affidavit, affirming upon
oath that I was alive, and that I was the same per-
son who took up the land for the planting the said
plantation at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with
a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his ac-
quaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the
return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants on whose
account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, There was the account current of the pro-
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal
captain, being for six years; the balance appeared
to be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years
more while they kept the effects in their hands, be-
fore the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they call Civil Death; and the balance of
this, the value of the plantation increasing, amount-
ed to — cruisadoes, which made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustines
account, who had received the profits for above
fourteen years; but not being able to account for
what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly de.
clared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which
he acknowledged to my account. As to the king's
part, that refunded nothing. -
There was also a letter of my partner's, congra-
tulating me very affectionately upon my being
alive; giving me an account how the estate was
improved, and what it produced a year, with a par-
ticular of the number of squares, or acres, that it
contained; how planted, how many slaves there
were upon it; and, making two and twenty crosses
for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave
Marias to thank the blessed Virgin that I was alive,
inviting me very passionately to come over and
take possession of my own, and in the meantime
to give him orders to whom he should deliver my
effects, if I did not come myself; concluding with
an hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his
family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine leo
pards skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa by some other ship which he had sent thi.
ther, and who, it seems, had 'made a better voyage
than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent
sweetmeats, and an hundred pieces of gold un-
coined, not quite so large as moidores.
By the same fleet my merchant-trustees shipped
me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold. -
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter
end of Job was better than the beginning. It is
impossible to express the flutterings of my very
heart, when I looked over these letters, and espe-
cially when I found all my wealth about me; for
as the Brasil ships came all in fleets, the same ships
which brought my letters brought my goods; and
the effects were safe in the Tagus before the letter
came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and
grew sick; and had not the old man run and
fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise
of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the
spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was
so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being
known, he ordered me to be let blood, after which
I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe,
if it had not been eased by the vent given in that
manner to the spirits, I should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above
£50,000 sterling in money, and had an estate, as I
might well call it, in the Brasils, of above a thou-
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in
England; and in a word, I was in a condition which
I scarce knew how to understand, or how to com-
pose myself for the enjoyment of
The first thing I did was to recompense my ori-
ginal benefactor, my good old captain, who had
been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to
me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end.
I shewed him all that was sent me; I told him that,
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposes
all things, it was owing to him ; and that it now
lay on me to reward him, which I would do an
hundred fold. So I first returned to him the hun-
dred moidores I had received of him; then I sent
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
release or discharge for the 470 moidores which he
had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and
firmest manner possible; after which I caused a
procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be
my receiver of the annual profits of my plantation,
and appointing my partner to account to him, and
make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my
name; and a clause in the end, being a grant of
100 moidores a year to him during his life, out of
the effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son
after him, for his life. And thus I requited my
old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in-
deed, I had more care upon my head now than I
had in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great
charge upon me, and my business was how to se-
cure it. I had never a cave to hide my money in,
or a place where it might lie without lock or key,
till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body
would meddle with it. On the contrary, I knew
not where to put it, or to whom to trust with it;
my old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and
that was the only refuge I had. . . .*
In the next place, my interest in the Brasils
seemed to summon methither; but now I could not
tell how to think of going thither till I had settled
my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who, I knew, was honest, and would be
just to me; but then she was in years, and but
poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt; so
that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to
England myself, and take my effects with me.
I was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been
my former benefactor, so I began to think of my
poor widow, whose husband had been my first be-
nefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing
I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill,
but to go find her out, and carry her in money an
hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her,
and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she
should, if I lived, have a further supply. At the
same time I sent my two sisters in the country,
each of them an hundred pounds, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
stances; one having been married, and left a wi-
dow; and the other having an husband not so kind
to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances, I
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst com-
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to
the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me.
. I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils,
and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were,
naturalized to the place; but I had some little
scruple in my mind about religion, which insensi-
bly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre-
sently. However, it was not religion that kept
me from going thither for the present; and as I
had made no scruple of being openly of the religion
of the country, all the while I was among them,
so neither did Iyet; only that now and then, having
of late thought more of it than formerly, when I
began to think of living and dying among them, I
began to regret my having professed myself a Papist,
and thought it might not be the best religion to
die in. - - -
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my ef.
fects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to Eng-
land with them, where, if I arrived, I concluded
I should make some acquaintance, or find some
relations, that would be faithful to me; and accord-
ingly I prepared to go for England with all my
wealth. * , , , -
In order to prepare things for my going home,
I first (the Brasil fleet being just going away) re-
solved to give answers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I had from thence; and
VOL. I. D D
*
first to the prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a letter
full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer
of the 872 moidores, which was undisposed of;
which I desired might be given, 500 to the mo-
nastery, and 872 to the poor, as the prior should
direct, desiring the good Padre's prayers for me,
and the like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trus-
tees, with all the acknowledgment that so much
justice and honesty called for; as for sending them
any present, they were far above having any occa-
sion for it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging
his industry in the improving the plantation, and
his integrity in increasing the stock of the works,
giving him instructions for his future government
of my part, according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send
whatever became due to me, till he should hear
from me more particularly : assuring him that it
was my intention, not only to come to him, but to
settle myself there for the remainder of my life.
To this I added a very handsome present of some
Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for
such the captain's son informed me he had ; with
two pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I
could get in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and
some Flanders lace of a good value.
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo,
and turned all my effects into good bills of ex-
change, my next difficulty was, which way to go
to England. I had been accustomed enough to
the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go
to England by sea at that time; and though I
could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty in-
creased upon me so much, that though I had once
shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered
my mind, and that not once, but two or three
times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea,
and this might be one of the reasons. But let no
man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts
in cases of such moment. Two of the ships which
I had singled out to go in, I mean more particu-
larly singled out than any other, that is to say, so
as in one of them to put my things on board, and
in the other to have agreed with the captain; I say,
two of these ships miscarried, viz. one was taken by
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned, ex-
cept three; so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable, and in which most, it was
hard to say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my
old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
pressed me earnestly not to go to sea; but either
to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the
Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but
an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to
Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so
all the way by land through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my go-
D D 2
ing by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that:
I resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as
I was not in haste, and did not value the charge,
was by much the pleasanter way; and to make it
more so, my old captain brought an English gen-
tleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travel with me; after which, we picked
up two who were English, and merchants also,
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last go-
ing to Paris only; so that we were in all six of us,
and five servants, the two merchants, and the two
Portuguese, contenting themselves with one ser-
vant between two, to save the charge; and as for
me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a
servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much
a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of
a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out for Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little troop, whereof they did me the
honour to call me captain, as well because I
was the oldest man, as because I had two ser-
vants, and indeed was the original of the whole
journey. -
As I have troubled you with none of my sea
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my
land journals. But some adventures that happened
to us in this tedious and difficult journey, I must
not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some
time to see the court of Spain, and to see what
was worth observing; but it being the latter part
of the summer, we hastened away, and set out
from Madrid about the middle of October. But
when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were
alarmed at several towns on the way, with an
account that so much snow was fallen on the
French side of the mountains, that several tra-
vellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna,
after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to
pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found
it so indeed; and to me that had been always used
to an hot climate, and indeed to countries where
we could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was
insufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than
it was surprising, to come but ten days before out
of the Old Castile, where the weather was not only
warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind
from the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so
severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes,
was very strange. -
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw
the mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampe-
luna, it continued snowing with so much violence,
and so long, that the people said, winter was come
before its time; and the roads, which were difficult
D D 3
before, were now quite impassable : in a word, the
snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in north-
ern countries, there was no going without being
in danger of being buried alive every step. We
staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna;
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no like-
lihood of its being better, for it was the severest
winter all over Europe that had been known in
many years) I proposed that we should all go away
to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bour-
deaux, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came
in four French gentlemen, who, having been stop-
ped on the French side of the passes, as we were
on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who tra-
versing the country near the head of Languedoc,
had brought them over the mountains by such
ways, that they were not much incommoded with
the snow; and where they met with snow in any
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no
hazard from the snow, provided we were armed
sufficiently to protect us from wild beasts; for he
said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for
some wolves to shew themselves at the foot of the
mountains, being made ravenous for want of food,
the ground being covered with snow. We told
him we were well enough prepared for such crea-
tures as they were, if he would insure us from a
kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told
we were in most danger from, especially on the
French side of the mountains.
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind
in the way that we were to go : so we readily
agreed to follow him : as did also twelve other
gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some
Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and
were obliged to come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna,
with our guide, on the fifteenth of November,
and indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of
going forward, he came directly back with us, on
the same road that we came from Madrid, above
twenty miles; when having passed two rivers, and
come into the plain country, we found ourselves
in a warm climate again, where the country was
pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden,
turning to the left, he approached the mountains
another way; and though it is true, the hills and
the precipices looked dreadfully, yet he made so
many tours, such meanders, and led us by such
winding ways, we insensibly passed the height of
the mountains, without being much incumbered
with the snow; and all on a sudden he shewed us
the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and
Gascoigne, all green and flourishing; though in-
deed they were at a great distance, and we had
some rough way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
D D 4
it snowed one whole day and a night, so fast, that
we could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we
should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that
we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before; and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on. -
'. It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear, out of an hollow way, adjoining to a
thick wood: two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he
had been devoured indeed, before we could have
helped him : one of them fastened upon his horse,
and the other attacked the man with that violence
that he had not time, or not presence of mind
enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried
out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next
to me, I bid him ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the
man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, O master!
O master! But, like a bold fellow, rode directly up
to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that
attacked him in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my
man Friday; for he, having been used to that kind
of creature in his country, had no fear upon him,
but went close up to him, and shot him as above;
whereas any of us would have fired at a further
distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf,
or endangered shooting the man.
*
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 409
- But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company,
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard
on both sides the dismallest howlings of wolves, and
the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there was
not such a few, as that we had no cause of ap-
prehensions. -
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the
other, that had fastened upon the horse, left him
immediately, and fled, having happily fastened
upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had
stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him
much hurt: the man, indeed, was most hurt; for
the raging creature had bit him twice, once on
the arm, and the other time a little above his knee;
and he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up, and
shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up as fast
as the way (which was very difficult) would give
us leave, to see what was the matter: as soon as
we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide; though
we did not presently discern what kind of creature
it was he had killed. -
But never was a fight managed so hardily, and
in such a surprising manner, as that which fol-
lowed between Friday and the bear, which gave
us all (though at first we were surprised and afraid
for him) the greatest diversion imaginable; as the
bear is an heavy, clumsy creature, and does not
gallop as the wolf does, which is swift and light;
so he has two particular qualities, which generally
are the rule of his actions; first as to men, who
are not his proper prey, I say not his proper prey,
because though I cannot say what excessive hun-
ger might do, which was now their case, the
ground being all covered with snow; yet as to
men, he does not usually attempt them, unless they
first attack him; on the contrary, if you meet him
in the woods, if you do not meddle with him, he
will not meddle with you; yet then you must take
care to be very civil to him, and give him the
road; for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not
go a step out of the way for a prince; nay, if you
are really afraid, your best way is to look another
way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if you
stop, and stand still, and look stedfastly at him, he
takes it for an affront; and if you throw or toss
any thing at him, and it hits him, though it were
but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it
for an affront, and sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in
point of honour, and this is his first quality; the
next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge,
but follow at a good round rate till he overtakes
you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his horse; for the man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first;
when, on a sudden, we espied the bear come out
of the wood, and a very monstrous one it was, the
biggest by far that ever I saw : we were all a little
surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the
fellow’s countenance: O! O! O! says Friday, three
times, pointing to him, O master! you give me te
leave, me shakee te hand with him, me makee you
good laugh.
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased.
You fool you, said I, he will eat you up. Eatee
me up! eatee me up! says Friday, twice over again;
Mee eatee him up; me make you good laugh; you
all stay here, me shew you good laugh: so down
he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and
put on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes
they wear) and which he had in his pocket, and
gives my other servant his horse, and, with his gun,
away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him :
Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me speakee wityou.
We followed at a distance; for now being come
down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains, we
were entered a vast great forest, where the country
was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in it
scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the
bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a
great stone, and throws at him, and hit him just on
the head; but did him no more harm than if he had
thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's
end; for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did
it purely to make the bear follow him, and shew us
some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking de-
vilish long strides, and shuffling along at a strange
rate, so as he would put an horse to a middling
gallop : away runs Friday, and takes his course, as
if he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved
to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man;
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing
the bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own business another way; and especially I
was angry that he had turned the bear upon us,
and then run away; and I called out, You dog,
said I, is this your making us laugh? Come away,
and take your horse, that we may shoot the crea-
ture. He hears me, and cries out, No shoot, no
shoot, stand still, you get much laugh: and as the
nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one,
he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and see-
ing a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beck-
oned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we fol-
lowed at a distance; the first thing he did, he
stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and
up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat,
though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the
folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not
for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till see-
ing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to
him. -
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and
the bear got about half way to him; as soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of the
tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, now you see
me teachee the bear dance; so he falls a jumping,
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began
to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind
him, to see how he should get back; then indeed
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done
with him by a great deal: when he sees him stand
still, he calls out to him again, as if he had sup-
posed the bear could speak English, What, you
come no further? Pray you come further. So he
left jumping and shaking the bough; and the bear,
just as if he understood what he said, did come a
little further; then he fell a jumping again, and
the bear stopped again. -
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the head, and called to Friday to stand still,
and we would shoot the bear; but he cried out
earnestly, O pray ! O pray! no shoot, me shoot
by and then; he would have said, by and bye.
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had
laughing enough indeed, but still could not ima-
gine what the fellow would do; for first we thought
he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we
found the bear was too cunning for that too; for
he would not get out far enough to be thrown
down, but clings fast with his great broad claws.
and feet, so that we could not imagine what
would be the end of it, and where the jest would
be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for
seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that
he would not be persuaded to come any further,
Well, well, said Friday, you no come further,
me go, me go; you no come to me, me come to
you ; and upon this he goes out to the smallest
end of the bough, where it would bend with his
weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding
down the bough till he came near enough to jump
down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes
it up, and stands still.
Well, said I to him, Friday, what will you do
now P Why don't you shoot him: No shoot, says
Friday, no yet; me shoot now me no kill; me stay,
give you one more laugh; and indeed so he did, as
you will see presently; for when the bear saw his
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely,
looking behind him every step, and coming back-
ward till he got into the body of the tree; then
with the same hinder end foremost, he came down
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving
one foot at a time, very leisurely; at this junc-
ture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon
the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped
the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him
as dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did
not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by
our looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud;
So we kills bear in my country, says Friday. So
you kill them, said I; why you have no guns.
No, says he, no guns, but shoot great much long
OF ROBINSON CHRUSOE. 415
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us, but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howl-
ing of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed
except the noise I once heard on the shore of
Africa, of which I have said something already, I
never heard any thing that filled me with so much
horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon-
strous creature off, which was worth saving; but
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened
us; so we left him, and went forward on our jour-
ney.
The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains;
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards,
were come down into the forest and plain country,
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where
they surprised the country people, killed a great
many of their sheep and horses, and some people
too. .
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves
in the country, we should find them there; and
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on
every side, and along narrow defile or lane, which
we were to pass to get through the wood, and then
we should come to the village where we were to
lodge. -
It was within half an hour of sunset when we
entered the first wood; and a little after sunset
when we came into the plain. We met with no-
thing in the first wood, except that in a little plain
within the wood, which was not above two furlongs
over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full
speed one after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in view; they took
no notice of us, and were gone and out of sight in a
few moments. - -
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture; for he believed there were more
wolves a coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and en-
tered the plain; as soon as we came into the plain,
we had occasion enough to look about us. The
first object we met with was a dead horse, that is
to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed,
and at least a dozen of them at work; we could
not say eating of him, but picking of his bones
rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their
feast, neither did they take much notice of us.
Friday would have let fly at them, but I would
not suffer him by any means; for I found we were
like to have more business upon our hands than
we were aware of. We were not half gone over
the plain, but we began to hear the wolves howl
in the woods, on our left, in a frightful manner;
and presently after we saw about an hundred com-
ing on directly towards us, all in a body, and most
of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn
up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in
what manner to receive them ; but found to draw.
ourselves in a close line, was the only way; so we
formed in a moment; but, that we might not have
too much interval, I ordered, that only every other
man should fire; and that the others, who had not
fired, should stand ready to give them a second
volley immediately, if they continued to advance
upon us; and that then those who had fired at
first, should not pretend to load their fusils again,
but stand ready, with every one a pistol, for we
WOL. I. E E
were all armed with a fusil, and a pair of pistols
each man; so we were, by this method, able to
fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at
present we had no necessity; for, upon firing the
first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being
terrified, as well with the noise as with the fire;
four of them being shot in the head, dropped;
several others were wounded, and went bleeding
off, as we could see by the snow: I found they
stopped, but did not immediately retreat; where-
upon remembering that I had been told, that the
fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a
man, I caused all our company to halloo as loud
as we could, and I found the notion not altogether
mistaken ; for upon our shout, they began to
retire, and turn about; then I ordered a second
volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to
the gallop, and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might lose no time, we kept going;
but we had but little more than loaded our fusils,
and put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard
a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left; only
that it was further onward the same way we were
to go.
The night was coming on, and the light began
to be dusky, which made it the worse on our side;
but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of those hell-
ish creatures; and, on a sudden, we perceived two
or three troops of wolves on our left, one behind
us, and one on our front, so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them; however, as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as
we could make our horses go, which, the way
being very rough, was only a good large trot; and
in this manner we came in view of the entrance of
a wood through which we were to pass, at the
further side of the plain: but we were greatly sur-
prised, when coming nearer the lane, or pass, we
saw a confused number of wolves standing just at
the entrance. -
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood,
we heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that
way, out rushed an horse, with a saddle and a
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen
or seventeen wolves after him full speed; indeed
the horse had the heels of them; but as we sup-
posed that he could not hold it at that rate, we
doubted not but they would get up with him at
last; and no question but they did. -
Here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found
the carcase of another horse, and of two men de-
voured by the ravenous creatures, and one of the
men was no doubt the same whom we heard
fire a gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off;
but as to the man, his head, and the upper part of
his body, were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not
what course to take; but the creatures resolved
us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in
E E 2
hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were:
three hundred of them. It happened very much.
to our advantage, that at the entrance into the
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large
timber trees, which had been cut down the sum-
mer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage;
I drew my little troop in among those trees, and:
placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I
advised them all to alight, and, keeping that tree.
before us, for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle,
or three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. .
We did so, and it was well we did ; for never
was a more furious charge than the creatures made
upon us in this place; they came on us with a
growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece
of timber (which, as I said, was our breast-work,)
as if they were only rushing upon their prey; and
this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occa-
sioned by their seeing our horses behind us, which
was the prey they aimed at: "I ordered our men to
fire as before, every other man; and they took their
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the
wolves at the first volley; but there was a neces-
sity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those be-
fore. *
When we had fired our second volley of fusils,
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they
would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for
others came forward again; so we fired two volleys
of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings,
we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and
lamed twice as many; yet they came on again.
I was loth to spend our last shot too hastily; so
I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he
was better employed; for, with the greatest dex-
terity imaginable, he had charged my fusil and his
own, while we were engaged; but, as I said, I
called my other man; and giving him a horn of
powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece
of timber, and let it be a large train; he did so,
and had but just time to get away, when the
wolves came up to it, and some were got up upon
it ; when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to
the powder, set it on fire; and those that were
upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or
seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among us,
with the force and fright of the fire; we dis-
patched these in an instant, and the rest were so
frighted with the light, which the night, for now it
was very near dark, made more terrible, that they
drew back a little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be
fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a
shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we
sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones,
which we found struggling on the ground, and
fell a cutting them with our swords, which an-
swered our expectation; for the crying and howl-
ing they made were better understood by their
fellows; so that they fled and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore
E E 3
of them; and had it been day-light, we had killed
many more. The field of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again, for we had still near a
league to go; we heard the ravenous creatures
howl and yell in the woods as we went, several
times; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were
not certain; so in about an hour more we came to
the town where we were to lodge, which we found
in a terrible fright, and all in arms; for, it seems,
that, the night before, the wolves and some bears
had broke into the village, and put them in a
terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep
guard night and day, but especially in the night,
to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.
. The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two
wounds, that he could go no further; so we were
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Thou-
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any
thing like them; but when we told our story at
Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the
ground; but they inquired much what kind of a
guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring
us that way in such a severe season; and told us,
it was a great chance we were not all devoured.
When we told them how we placed ourselves, and
the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceed-
ingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had
been all destroyed; for it was the sight of the
horses that, made the wolves so furious, seeing
their prey; and that at other times they are really
afraid of a gun; but they being excessive hungry,
and raging on that account, the eagerness to come
at the horses had made them senseless of danger;
and that if we had not by the continued fire, and
at last by the stratagem of the train of powder,
mastered them, it had been great odds but that we
had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been
content to have sat still on horseback, and fired
as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their
backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that
at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our
horses, they would have been so eager to have
devoured them, that we might have come off safe,
especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and
being so many in number.
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger
in my life; for seeing above three hundred devils
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe, I
shall never care to cross those mountains again; I
think I would much rather go a thousand leagues
by sea, though I were sure to meet with a storm
once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through France; nothing but what
E E 4
other travellers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than I can. I travelled from
Thoulouse to Paris, and without any considerable
stay, came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover,
the fourteenth of January, after having had a
severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels,
and had in a little time all my new discovered
estate safe about me, the bills of exchange, which
I brought with me, having been very currently
paid. -
My principal guide and privy counsellor, was
my good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the
money I had sent her, thought no pains too much,
or care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted
her so entirely with every thing, that I was per-
fectly easy as to the security of my effects; and
indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this
good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and
so to the Brasils: but now another scruple came
in the way, and that was religion; for as I had
entertained some doubts about the Roman religion,
even while I was abroad, especially in my state of
solitude; so I knew there was no going to the
Brasils for me, much less going to settle there, un-
less I resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic re-
ligion, without any reserve; except on the other
hand I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles,
be a martyr for religion, and die in the Inquisition:
so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find
means for it, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lis-
bon, who in return gave me notice, that he could
easily dispose of it there : but that if I thought
fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the
two merchants, the survivors of my trustees who
lived in the Brasils, who must fully understand the
value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and who
I knew to be very rich, so that he believed they
would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt,
but I should make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the
more of it. . -
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer
it to them, and he did so ; and in about eight
months more, the ship being then returned, he
sent me an account, that they had accepted the
offer, and had remitted 83,000 pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange
for 82,800 pieces of eight for the estate; reserving
the payment of 100 moidores a year, to him (the
old man) during his life, and 50 moidores after-
wards to his son for his life, which I had promised
them; and which the plantation was to make good
as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first
part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of
Providence's chequer-work, and of a variety which
the world will seldom be able to shew the like of:
beginning foolishly, but closing much more hap-
pily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much
as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other circum-
stances had concurred: but I was inured to a
wandering life, had no family, not many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much ac-
quaintance; and though I had sold my estate in
the Brasils, yet I could not keep that country out
of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if
the poor Spaniards were in being there; and how
the rogues I left there had used them.
My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded
me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that
almost for seven years she prevented my running
abroad; during which time I took my two nephews,
the children of one of my brothers, into my care :
the eldest having something of his own, I bred up
as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some
addition to his estate, after my decease; the other
I put out to a captain of a ship; and after five
years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising
young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent
him to sea: and this young fellow afterwards drew
me in, as old as I was, to further adventures
myself.
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here:
for, first of all, I married, and that not either to my
disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three chil-
dren, two sons and one daughter: but my wife
dying, and my nephew coming home with good
success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to
go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and en-
gaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the
East Indies. This was in the year 1694.
In this voyage I visited my new colony in the
island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left
there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards,
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united,
separated, and how at last the Spaniards were
obliged to use violence with them; how they were
subjected to the Spaniards; how honestly the
Spaniards used them; an history, if it were entered
into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as
my own part; particularly also as to their battles
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times
upon the island, and as to the improvement they
made upon the island itself; and how five of them
made an attempt upon the main land, and brought
away eleven men and five women prisoners; by
which, at my coming, I found about twenty young
children on the island.
Here I stayed about twenty days; left them
supplies of all necessary things, and particularly of
arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two work-
men, which Ibrought from England with me; viz.
a carpenter and a smith. . . - .
• Besides this, I shared the land into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts, respectively, as they
agreed on; and having settled all things with them,
and engaged them not to leave the place, I left
them there. - . . . . .
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from
whence I sent a bark, which I bought there, with
more people, to the island; and in it, besides other
supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I
found proper for service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to the Englishmen, I pro-
mised them to send them some women from Eng-
land, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they
would apply themselves to planting; which I after-
wards performed: and the fellows proved very
honest and diligent, after they were mastered,
and had their properties set apart for them. I
sent them also from the Brasils five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some
hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably
increased.
But all these things, with an account how 300
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their
plantations, and how they fought with that whole
number twice, and were at first defeated and three
of them killed; but at last a storm destroying their
enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed almost
all the rest, and renewed and recovered the posses-
sion of their plantation, and still lived upon the
island.
All these things, with some very surprising inci-
dents in some new adventures of my own, for ten
years more, I may, perhaps, give a further account
of hereafter.

PR E FA C E
TO
THE PRESENT EDITION.
“Robinson CRUsor,” says Marmontel, “is
the first book I ever read with exquisite
pleasure—and I believe every boy in Europe
might say the same thing.” Next indeed to
the Holy Scriptures, it may safely be asserted,
that this delightful Romance has, cver since
it was written, exerted the first and most
powerful influence upon the juvenile mind
of England — nor has its popularity been
much less among any of the other nations
of Christendom. At a period when few of
the productions of English genius had been
transferred into any of the languages of
foreigners, this masterpiece of the homely,
unaffected, unpretending, but rich and mas-
culine intellect of Daniel Defoe, had already
acquired, in every cultivated tongue of
Europe, the full privileges of a native work.
Although abounding in all the prejudices of
VOI,. I. a.
his countrymen, even in those confined to
the humbler orders of his countrymen, the
nationality of Defoe's notions formed no
obstacle to his acceptance abroad; because
it did not interfere in any way with the effect
of his broad and sure pictures of human
nature ; his unfailing appeals to the ele-
mental workings of the human mind; his
mastery over the universal passions; the
sagacity, finally, and the deep wisdom of
those views of human character and con-
duct, which in Robinson Crusoe more suc-
cessfully than in any production of the same
captivating species, are made to display
themselves in the apparently artless conca-
tenation of the incidents of a fictitious
narrative, and the developement of one
imaginary individual’s mind. The work,
indeed, requires only to be made known
among nations the most remote from us and
our manners, in order to its receiving among
them the same unanimous testimony of ap-
probation. In the course of those laborious
years which the late enlightened and enter-
prising traveller Burckhardt devoted to the
study of the Arabic language in Syria and
Egypt, we find that he amused and improved
himself by rendering into that dialect a great
part of this Romance. While he was com-
posing it, he used to read passages of his
work to his Arab friends, when they came to
sit at his gate in the cool hours of evening :
and the most learned and the most ignorant
of them, says he, expressed equal delight
and admiration. The most bigoted lovers
of oriental literature could not help con-
fessing, that The Frankish Storyteller had
afforded them as much amusement as the
historian of Sinbad, without ever having
recourse to any thing in the smallest degree
improbable, and without ever writing one
sentence less pregnant with instruction than
with amusement.
Defoe was a man of no small consequence
among his own contemporaries, long before
he wrote Robinson Crusoe ; and his chief
fame, even during the after part of his life,
was far from depending chiefly on this
masterpiece; but it may be doubted if, but
for it, his name would have occupied any
considerable space in the literary history of
his country. His poetry, which made great
noise in his own time, is now almost entirely
unknown: and indeed it scarcely deserves a
better fate; for although a few passages of
fine conception may be found, these are only
a 2
rari mantes in gurgite vasto of more than
prosaic dullness. His ear, moreover, appears
to have been most unmusical, for although
he wrote while Dryden's fame was at its full,
and witnessed also the developement of the
genius of Pope, his versification is through-
out harsh and irregular, scarcely reaching
unless in a few casual lines, beyond the ex-
cellence of that of John Dunton. The sub-
jects of his poetical compositions are not
such as of themselves to invite perpetuity of
attention. The politics of Swift are kept
alive by his wit: but the poetry of Defoe
cannot embalm his praises of King William,
or his vituperations of the doctrine of Jus
Divinum. Some of his political tracts in
prose, and above all his History of the Union
of Great Britain, may be well deserving of
more attention than is now generally be-
stowed on them; and several of his other
novels are not unworthy of their author's
genius : but unless the memory of these
lesser productions had been sustained by the
splendour of the reputation of Robinson
Crusoe, it is very doubtful whether any of
them would have been found at this day on
any other shelves than those of literary or
historical antiquarians. After all, the great
body of English readers know nothing of any
of Defoe's writings except the first and best
of his romances; and, in general, they know
very little about the personal history of its
author. Their acquaintance with his genius
is formed at that early age, when it is quite
natural and quite easy to get a book by heart
without ever wasting a thought on its merits
or its author. And the habit thus acquired
of considering Robinson Crusoe pretty much
in the light of a thing existing of and by
itself, is insensibly continued by most people
throughout life. Whatever may be the cause,
the fact is certain, that there is no great
English author of whom so little is popularly
known as Daniel Defoe. The industry of
Chalmers, and the judgment of Kippis, have
already collected and arranged all the ma-
terials of his biography; but their lives of
Defoe have appeared in shapes not the most
friendly to their circulation; and for that
reason, the publishers of the present splendid
edition of Robinson Crusoe have judged fit
to prefix some brief notices of its author, in
a form more adapted for the usual readers of
books of amusement.
He was born, as nearly as can be ascer-
tained, in the year 1663, and in all probability
a 3
in London, for his father was James Foe, a
butcher, of the parish of St. Giles, Cripple-
gate. His family were protestant dissenters,
and he, through life adhered to the same
persuasion. “A dissenter,” he himself says,
“I am, but no independent fifth-monarchy
man or leveller.” His father seems to have
early discovered the superiority of young
Daniel's talents, for he placed him under the
care of Mr. Charles Morton, of Newington
Green, a distinguished teacher among the
dissenters, in whose house he remained for
several years, at an expense much beyond
what fathers in that humble walk of life were
then in the custom of bestowing on the edu-
cation of their children. In 1705 he was re-
proached with want of letters by his adversary
Tutchin, and thus replied: “I owe this jus-
tice to my ancient father, who is yet living,
and in whose behalf I freely testify, that if I
am a blockhead, it is nobody's fault but my
own; he having spared nothing that might
qualify me to match the accurate Dr. Bently,
or the most learned Tutchin.”
For what particular line of life the butcher
intended to rear his promising son, there is
no ground to conjecture; he himself asserts,
that he never served any apprenticeship; but
it is probable, trade in some shape was his
destination. He was admitted a liveryman
of London, in right of his birth, on the 26th
of January 1687-8, and appeared, if we may
believe Oldmixon, on horseback, and in gallant
attire, among a chosen band of citizens, who
escorted King William from Whitehall to the
Mansion-house, when the monarch was
feasted by the Lord Mayor, on the 29th of
October in the succeeding year. Even before
this period, however, Daniel had distinguished
himself in more ways than one; he wrote a
pamphlet in 1683, to show the absurdity of
leaving the Austrians to be conquered by the
Turks—a line of policy then recommended
by many narrow-minded and short-sighted
protestants; and in 1685 he quitted the pa-
ternal mansion, and shared in the unfortunate
insurrection, which terminated in the ruin
and death of the Duke of Monmouth. Defoe,
however, was lucky enough to escape, both
from the dangers of battle, and the blood-
thirstiness of Jefferys, and aided by the ob-
scurity of his appearance and station, regained
his father's roof in safety. From this period
till the Revolution, it is reasonable to
suppose he kept quiet at home; although it
may be suspected his attention to business
a 4
was not quite so great as it should have
been. -
Already he had established himself in trade,
on his own account, and there seems to be no
ground for distrusting the tradition which as-
cribes to him the profession of a hosier. His
wit, whatever was the nature of his shop, car-
ried him too often from the shop to the tavern;
and a manufacture of tiles at Tilbury, in Essex,
in which he had also embarked, was probably
still more neglected. In 1692 his affairs had
fallen into such disorder, that he was obliged
to abscond from his creditors, and a commis-
sion of bankruptcy was taken out against him.
The debts which he had thus contracted, he
however considered himself as in honour
obliged to discharge by his after exertions;
and in 1705 we find him asserting, in answer
to some ungenerous sarcasms of his enemies,
that he had already, by his industry, reduced
a debt of seventeen to less than five thousand
pounds; but in the meantime he was left
without employment or means of professional
subsistence, not having as yet attained thirty
years of age, and known only as he deserved
to be known, to a very few intimate friends.
These appear to have exerted themselves
as became them in his behalf; one gen-
tleman proposed to him to go to Cadiz as
factor to a mercantile house, under very
favourable prospects of success and advance-
ment, but Defoe felt such a reluctance to
leave the soil of England, that he at once
rejected this plan. By the interest of another
he procured the situation of accountant
to the commissioners for managing the
duties on glass, in which he remained for
four years, till the commission was termi-
nated by act of parliament. During these
four years, however, his pen was not idle;
he produced successively many tracts on poli-
tical subjects, and still more on subjects of
commercial policy, which attracted attention,
and increased his reputation. Among these
his Essay on Projects is deserving of no in-
considerable praise. On the subjects of
Bullion, of Banking, and on the propriety
of erecting a Court of Merchants for the
decision of purely mercantile causes, he
made many sagacious remarks which might
be perused with advantage, even by the
statesmen of the present day. His peculiar
vein of satire may be discerned peeping out
here and there, even in the Essay on Pro-
jects. One of his favourite schemes is the
erection of an academy for the education of
women. “A woman well-bred and well-
taught,” says he, “furnished with the
additional accomplishments of knowledge
and behaviour, is a creature without compa-
rison; her society is the emblem of sublimer
enjoyments, her person is angelic, her con-
versation heavenly. She is every way
suitable to the sublimest wish; and the man
that has such a one to his portion, has
nothing to do but to rejoice in her and be
thankful. On the other hand, suppose her
to be the same woman, and rob her of the
benefit of education, and it follows thus: II
her temper be good, want of education
makes her soft and easy. Her wit, for want
of teaching, makes her impertinent and
talkative. Her knowledge, for want of judg-
ment and experience, makes her fanciful and
whimsical. If her temper be bad, want of
breeding makes it worse; and she grows
haughty, insolent, and loud. If she be
passionate, want of manners makes her a
termagant and a scold, which is much at
one with lunatic. If she be proud, want of
discretion (which still is breeding) makes her
conceited, fantastic, and ridiculous. And
from these she degenerates to be turbulent,
clamorous, noisy, nasty, AND THE DEvil.”
Another of the pieces published at this
period, was An Inquiry into the occasional
Conformity of Dissenters in cases of Preferment,
with a preface addressed “To the Lord
Mayor, occasioned by his carrying the sword
to a conventicle.” There is great sincerity,
warmth, and truth in the whole strain of this
pamphlet, and no doubt it must have thrown
the city into a ferment. There is no
answering his principal positions; viz. “that
he who dissents from the established church,
except from a true principle of conscience,
is guilty of a great sin; that he who con-
forms to the established church against his
conscience, is guilty of a great sin; and that
he who both dissents and conforms at the
same time, must be guilty of one of those
great sins.” The Lord Mayor, whose con-
duct in carrying the city regalia to a con-
venticle elicited the attack of Defoe, was
however still more effectually punished by
Swift's sarcasm in the Tale of a Tub, where
JAck is represented as “getting upon a
great horse and eating custard.” The un-
fortunate dignitary's name was Sir Humphry
Edwin : Swift's similitude shews that the
state coach was not then introduced, and
Defoe himself elsewhere alludes to the
equestrian displays of the Chief Magistrate,
“To ride the city horse, and wear the chain.”
A third pamphlet of this period is entitled
“An argument shewing that a standing
army, with consent of parliament, is not
inconsistent with a free government.” A
fourth is “Reasons against a war with
France:” in this the absurdity of rushing into
a war merely because the French king had
allowed to the son of James II. the honorary
title of King of England, is exposed with
much plain sense and well-applied ridicule.
A fifth tract is, “The original power of the
collective body of the people of England
examined and asserted;” a very powerful per-
formance, the main argument of which is as
irresistible as its language is forcible. Those
misguided writers of the present day, who are
continually broaching so many dangerous doc-
trines concerning the mutual relations of the
people and the parliament of England, would
do well to observe with what temperate and
grave delicacy this difficult subject has been
treated by an old whig, and a keen one, in
these masterly pages.
Forgotten as Defoe's poetry now is, it was
however by a poetical performance that he
first attracted the notice of government, and
became a man of consequence in the public
eye. In the last years of King William's
reign, it is well known how much the spirits
of the tories were raised by the prospect of
a female reign, and how zealously the tory
writers exerted themselves to depreciate the
services of William, and to prepare the mind
of the people for what they now considered
not an improbable event, the restoration of
the male line of Stuart. One Tutchin,
whose name has already been noticed, pub-
lished at this crisis a violent attack upon King
William's person and government, entitled
The Foreigners. In this production, which
accused His Majesty of every kind of wicked-
ness, cruelty, and tyranny, the whole stream
of abuse was terminated with the one hateful
word Foreigner, and it was this last reproach
which chiefly roused the indignation of
Daniel Defoe." Of The true-born English-
man, the satire by which he replied to
* The foreign air of Daniel's own name, by the way,
was often made a matter of reproach among his contem-
poraries. It is now sufficiently certain, that the prefix de
which gives this French aspect to the patronimic, was
merely an invention of Daniel's own juvenile vanity
euphoniae causá.
Tutchin, it is not possible to speak very
highly, considering it merely as a piece of
poetical writing; but there is no question
that as a piece of historical argument, it is
quite irresistible, and not a few detached
passages display vigour of language and
fancy not unworthy of the author. It opens
with two lines which have since passed into
a proverb,
“Wherever God erects a house of prayer,
The Devil always builds a chapel there:”
and he adds,
“And 'twill be found, upon examination,
The latter has the largest congregation.”
The empire of Satan, we are then told, is
administered by different hands, in different
regions;—
“Pride, the first peer and president of Hell,
To his share Spain, the largest province fell.”
Germany is governed by Drunkenness, Italy
by Lust, Ireland by Zeal, Russia by Ignorance,
and, strange information,
“The Chinese by a child of Hell called WIT.”
To conclude the list,
“Rage rules the Portuguese, and Fraud the Scotch,
Revenge the Pole, and Avarice the Dutch.”
while INGRATITUDE has from time imme-
morial been the bane of England;
“A devil of black renown,
An ugly, surly, sullen, selfish spirit,
Who Satan's worst perfections does inherit.”
The confusion of races from which the
modern English are descended, is the chief
topic on which he enlarges.
“ The Romans first with Julius Caesar came,
Including all the nations of that name,
Gauls, Greeks, and Lombards; and by computation,
Auxiliaries or slaves of every nation.
With Hengist Saxons; Danes with Sweno came,
In search of plunder — not in search of fame;
Scots, Picts, and Irish from the Hibernian shore,
And conquering William brought the Normans o'er.
All these their barbarous offspring left behind,
The dross of armies—they of all mankind,
Blended with Britons, who before were here,
Of whom the Welch have blest the character.
From this amphibious ill-born mob began
That vain ill-natured thing, an Englishman;
The customs, surnames, languages, and manners
Of all these nations, are their own explainers;
Whose relics are so lasting and so strong,
They ha’ left a shibboleth upon our tongue,
By which with easy search you may distinguish,
Your Roman—Saxon—Danish—Norman—English.”
The copious additions of Huguenots, Wal-
loons, &c. in the reign of Queen Bess, the
strong tide of Scottish blood that entered
with James, and last of all, the effects or
the restoration of Charles the second, in this
way are described at length.
“He carefully repeopled us again,
Throughout his lazy, long, lascivious reign,
With such a blest and true-born English fry,
As much illustrates our nobility;
A gratitude which will so black appear,
As future ages must abhor to hear;
When they look back on all that crimson flood,
Which streamed in Lindeseys and Caernarvon's blood.
Bold Stafford, Cambridge, Capel, Lucas, Lisle,
Who crown'd in death his father's funeral pile;
The loss of whom, in order to supply
With true-born English-bred nobility.
Six bastard dukes survive his luscious reign,
The labours of Italian Castlemain, - }
French Portsmouth, Tabby Scot, and Cambrian,
Besides the numerous, bright, and virgin throng,
Whose female glories shade them from my song.
This offspring, if one age they multiply,
May half the house with English peers supply;
There with true English pride they may contemn,
Schomberg and Portland — new-made noblemen.”
To the second edition of this satire is
prefixed a preface, in which Defoe vindicates
himself from the charge of “depreciating his
countrymen.” “Had we been an unmixed
nation,” says he, sarcastically, “I am of opi-
nion it had been for our disadvantage. For, to
go no further, we have three nations about us,
as clear from mixtures of blood as any in the
world, and I know not which of them I could
wish ourselves to be like; I mean the Scots,
the Irish, and the Welsh : and if I were to
write a reverse to the satire, I would examine
all the nations of Europe, and prove that
those nations which are most mixed, are the
best, and have least of barbarism and bru-
tality about them; and abundance of reason
might be given for it, too long for a preface.”
Excellent as this performance may in some
respects deserve to be considered, it is not so
much for itself as for the effects it produced
on the condition of its author, that we have
noticed it at so much length. King William
was no great lover or judge of poetry; but
he had discernment enough to perceive that
Defoe was a valuable ally, and he immediately
expressed a wish to be personally acquainted
with him. That Daniel was forthwith sent
for to the palace, and conversed with the
King—that repeated interviews afterwards
followed this introduction—that His Majesty
was pleased with his manners and sentiments,
and ever after regarded him with favour—and
that he even employed him in many secret
services, all in consequence of the acceptable
VOL. I. b
flattery of the True-born Englishman—these
are facts, which Defoe himself mentioned at a
time when he could not have dared to invent
them; but the particular details, which he
neglected to consign to writing, cannot now be
supplied by all the researches that have been
made among the works of his cotemporaries
—friends and enemies to the government of
King William. The favour of the monarch,
Defoe in the meantime continued to culti-
vate by a variety of political tracts, the
names of which may be found in the list of
his woks, published at the end of this oreface.
The nature of the topics handled in them,
has condemned the greater part of them to
neglect and oblivion; but he that would write
or even study with accuracy the history of
that period of fermentation, alarm, and sus-
picion in the public mind of England, cannot
hope for success in his researches, unless he
has patience to go over the fugitive pieces of
Daniel Defoe. In many of them he will find
more amusement than their subjects might
lead him to expect—in all of them he will at
least find traces of a genuine and masculine
English intellect, and a power of language
which he will seek for in vain among the
far greater mass of miscellaneous politics,
either of that or of any other period in our
history. It is one of the chief reproaches of
our press, that no uniform or collected edition
of these works has ever appeared in England;
but of this, more hereafter.
The death of King William was thus a
personal misfortune of no small consequence
to Defoe; and ever after, the memory of that
prince was regarded and spoken of by him
with a sacred and grateful reverence, which
does honour to his feelings. During the vio-
lent tumults of party warfare, which immedi-
ately followed the death of his patron, and
the succession of Queen Anne, we find our
author exerting himself in prose and in verse,
in defence of the same religion and political
principles he had all along professed. The
ascendance gained by the high-church party,
gave extreme pain to him as a dissenter; and
he produced, for the purpose of annoying
them, and serving his own friends, a very
powerful piece of irony, which, strange to tell,
no one, either among those he wrote for, or
among those he wrote against, had wit enough
to comprehend; and yet one cannot peruse
The short way with the Dissenters, at this dis-
tance of time, without being astonished with
the extent of this stupidity. Every argument
b 2
of intolerance and bigotry is therein set forth
with most laborious assumption of gravity,
and such an invincible air of earnestness
however, that the zealots of both sides were
alike taken in. “The High-flyers”—as he calls
them — did not dare to espouse openly the
cause of one whom they considered in the
light of a too bold and incautious adherent—
while the deceived dissenters and their friends
in parliament, were loud in their cries for
revenge against the best writer their cause
could then boast,
“ — Such is the fate of too much wit,
Mistook and cursed by those that most are served
by it.”
If the chief Tory leaders understood his drift
at all, the former writings of Defoe had already
incensed them against him, and they were too
glad to seize an opportunity so favourable for
crushing an enemy, with the consent of his own
party. Accordingly we find, that on the 25th
of February 1702-3 a member rose in the
House of Commons, to move for the infliction
of some punishment upon the author of The
short way with the Dissenters; and having read
aloud some pages of it, the House immediately
resolved mem.com. “that this book being full of
false and scandalous reflections on this Par-
liament, and tending to promote sedition, be
burnt by the common hangman to-morrow
in New Palace Yard.”—This had been pre-
ceded by a royal proclamation of January
10th, to the following purpose: “Whereas .
Daniel Defoe alias Defooe is charged with
writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet,
entitled The shortest way with the Dissenters;
he is a middle-sized spare man, about 40 years
old, of a brown complexion, and dark brown
coloured hair, but wears a wig, a hooked nose,
a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole
near his mouth : was born in London, and
for many years was a hose factor in Free-
man's Yard in Cornhill, and now is owner of
the brick and pantile works near Tilbury Fort
in Essex: whoever shall discover the said
Daniel to one of Her Majesty's principal se-
cretaries of state, or any of Her Majesty's
justices of the peace, so he may be appre-
hended, shall have a reward of sé50, which
Her Majesty has ordered to be paid imme-
diately upon such discovery.” Did we not
know that many worthy divines preached and
prayed with all solemnity against Swift's
Project for discarding Christianity, conceiving
the argument of that famous jeu d'esprit to be
a serious strain of wicked blasphemy; and were
b 3
we not furnished in the subsequent history of
Defoe himself with another example of the
same kind of stupidity, we might be tempted
to set this down as a solitary and almost in-
credible instance of blindness and want of
perception. So it was however: pursued by a
royal proclamation, and denounced by a re-
solution of the Commons, Defoe soon found
himself unable to remain concealed. Whether
his retirement was betrayed by some false
friend, or whether his surrender was voluntary,
we find him shortly after submitting or com-
pelled to be tried for his crime of wit; and in
spite of an explanation he published on the
eve of his trial, than which nothing could
be more entirely full and satisfactory, he was
condemned to pay a fine which nearly ruined
his fortune *, to stand three times in the pil-
lory, and to be imprisoned during the Queen's
pleasure. He bore the pillory with infinite
fortitude, to which circumstance one of the
many ungenerous lines of the Dunciadalludes:
“Earless on high stood unabashed Defoe.”
* He says he lost by this affair £3,500, but he pro-
bably includes the damage done to his tile-work concerns
by his imprisonment; the fine itself was only 200 marks.
See State Trials, vol. v. ed. 1730, p. 553.
It is melancholy to see that such a man as
Pope was capable of enjoying the punish-
ment of a man like Defoe; punished only
because nobody had sense to understand his
meaning. Since we are speaking of the Dun-
ciad, we may as well notice the two other
introductions of Defoe's name in that poem:
“She saw old Pryn in restless Daniel shine,
And Eusden eke out Blackmore's endless line.”
In this, the ungenerous allusion to poor
Defoe's pillory is repeated. Pryn, as our
readers recollect, suffered the same punish-
ment in the age before, by reason of the
relentless animosity of Laud; and Defoe
doubtless shared much of the principles of
the old Puritan, as well as of his fate. The
third passage is that in which Pope avenges
himself on Norton, an obscure writer in the
Morning Post, for certain attacks in that
paper.
“Norton from Daniel and Ostraea sprung,
Blest with the father's front and mother's tongue.”
This piece of scandal is first found in Savage's
preface to his Author to be let ; where he says,
“Had it not been an honester livelihood for
Mr. Norton, (Daniel Defoe's son of love by a
lady who vended oysters,) to have dealt in a
b 4
fish market, than to be dealing out the
dialect of Billingsgate in the Flying Post.”
Some of the other members of the Scriblerus
Club, seem to have shared in Pope's absurdly
low opinion of Defoe. Hear what Gay says
of him,-‘‘The fellow, who had excellent na-
tural talents, but wanted some small founda-
tion of learning, is a lively instance of those
wits, who, as an ingenious author says, will
bear but one skimming".” That Pope might
be entitled in many points of view to look
down on Defoe, it may be granted: but the
contempt of Gay for such a man as the author
of Robinson Crusoe, is really too much of a
joke to pass unnoticed; one skimming ! It is
thus, that a man of mere elegance and wit,
but by no means entitled to be classed with
the creative or majestic spirits of the earth,
dares to speak of the rich, the inexhaustible
genius, which produced works that will out-
live the language in which they are written,
should that language ever be forgotten: It is
thus, that in every age your people of accom-
plishment and acuteness have dared to lift up
their voices in derision of the true “Men of
Might !” But let the small men of our own
time profit by the example of those of days
* State of Wit, 1711.
preceding; let them observe, that the author
of Gay's Fables satirized the author of Robin-
son Crusoe in his own days, to the satisfaction
of the coffee-house wits; and discover in the
smile with which we now regard such satire,
the sure index to the judgment of posterity
on their sarcasms against greater men than
Defoe, “homines longè minores longé majora
commissi.”
Defoe, in the meantime, was cast down
neither by the severity of his punishment
nor the sarcasms of his enemies. He pub-
lished almost immediately a Hymn to the
Pillory, in which the spirit of the man gives
new spirit to his poetry. He says,
66 Men, that are men, in thee can feel no pain,
And all thy insignificants disdain.
Contempt, that false new word for Shame,
Is, without crime, an empty name;
A shadow to amuse mankind,
But cannot fright the wise or well-fix'd mind.
Virtue despises human scorn,
And scandals innocence adorn.”
The great John Selden was at one time in
danger of the pillory, on account of his
History of Tythes; and, in allusion to this,
he goes on,
“Even the learned Selden saw,
A prospect of thee through the law;
He had thy lofty pinnacles in view,
But so much honour never was thy due.
Had the great Selden triumphed on thy stage,
Selden, the honour of his age,
No man would ever shun thee more,
Or grudge to stand where Selden stood before.” "
An Elegy on the Author of the true-born
Englishman followed shortly after — full of a
similar strain of sentiments, but very inferior
in its style of composition. The most ani-
mated part of it is a severe attack on the
lawyers, for he seems to have thought his
defence had been but poorly conducted :

I ne'er had ventured to believe

It is impossible not to acquiesce in the justice
of Defoe's displeasure against those who had
undertaken his defence on the late trial.
Nothing but the utmost weakness or wicked-
ness on the part of bar, bench, and jury,
can account for the issue of it.
During the first months of his confinement
he republished a variety of his pieces, under
the name of “A true Collection of the Works
of the Author of the True-born Englishman,”
in one volume 8vo, to which another volume
was shortly added. To the first volume a
head of Defoe was prefixed, engraved by
Vandergucht from a picture by Taverner.
It is the same from which all the other prints
of Defoe have been copied ; and no portrait
*
can have more verisimilitude, to say the
least of it. It exhibits a set of features
rather regular than otherwise, very deter-
mined in their outlines, more particularly the
mouth, which expresses great firmness and
resolution of character. The eyes are full,
black, and grave-looking; but the impression
of the whole countenance is rather a striking
than a pleasing one. Daniel is here set forth
in a most lordly full-bottomed wig, which
flows down lower than his elbow, and rises
above his forehead with great amplitude of
curl. A richly laced cravat, and fine loose
flowing cloak, complete his attire, and pre-
serve, we may suppose, the likeness of that
civic “gallantry,” which Oldmixon ascribes
to Daniel on the occasion of his escorting
King William to the Lord Mayor's feast. It
is altogether more like the picture of a sub-
stantial citizen of the “surly breed” Defoe
himself has so often satirized, than that of
a poor pamphleteer languishing in jail after
the terrors of the pillory.
The distressed state of his circumstances,
it is probable, made our prisoner soon feel it
necessary to undertake some regular work,
by which he might support himself during his
confinement: and the plan which he accord-
ingly laid down for himself, and the manner
in which he carried it on for a great number
of years, are alike honourable to his judg-
ment and his perseverance. The first number
of THE REview was published on the 19th
of February 1703-4, and continued to appear
at first twice, afterwards three times a week,
for full nine years afterwards. In this paper,
which appeared in the shape of a quarto
sheet, Defoe gave a summary of all news,
foreign and domestic, together with his own
opinions at great length on all matters of
political or commercial interest. To enliven
the pages of his journal, he devoted a part of
every sheet to the annals of a fictitious
Scandal Club, of whose concerns he gave
himself out to be the sole secretary and depo-
sitary, and in this way took occasion to divert
the town with the description of a thousand
lighter topics of all kinds. Criticism, theo-
logy, ethics, in all their branches, but more
particularly the tea-table and coffee-house
topics of “language, poetry, love, marriage,
drunkenness, and gaming,” are continually
introduced.
There can be no doubt of the fact,
although Dr. Johnson was either ignorant
or disdainful of it, that this part of Defoe's
design paved the way for, and set the ex-
ample of, that species of writing soon after-
wards carried to its perfection in the Tatlers
and Spectators. ' That Daniel Defoe wanted
many of those qualities, both of mind and
manner, which fitted Steele and Addison to
be the inimitable arbitri elegantiarum of
English society, there can be no doubt :
yet it is in vain to conceal that they profited
very much by the inventive genius which pre-
ceded them in their favourite path; or to deny
that there exist in the Reviews of Defoe many,
very many passages, which for wit, humour,
originality of conception, justness of observa-
tion, keenness of satire, and for power, variety,
nay, even elegance of style, are scarcely in-
ferior to the best specimens of their compo-
sitions. The political articles of the Review,
however, were doubtless as much superior to
the others in interest then, as they are in-
ferior now. It was evident abundantly, from
the impression they made on the public
mind, that the various rich and energetic
talents of Defoe, might under proper direc-
tions render him a most important ally to
any party. The sagacity of Sir Robert
Harley, then speaker of the commons, led
him very early to make this discovery, and
he lost no time in communicating his senti-
ments to Defoe himself. Hear Daniel’s own
account of Harley's first communication
with him: “While I lay friendless and dis-
tressed, “says he, “in the prison of Newgate,
my family ruined, and myself without hope
of deliverance, a message was brought me
from a person of honour, who till that time
I never had the least acquaintance with or
knowledge of, otherwise than by fame or
sight, as we know men of quality by seeing
them on public occasions. I gave no present
answer to the person who brought it, having
not duly weighed the import of the message.
The message was by word of mouth, thus,
‘Pray ask that gentleman what I can do
for him P” But in return to this kind and
generous message, I immediately took my
pen and ink, and wrote the story of the Blind
Man in the gospel who followed our Saviour,
and to whom our blessed Lord put the
question, ‘What wilt thou that I shall do
unto thee P’ who, as if he had made it
strange that such a question should be
asked, or as if he had said, Lord, dost thou
see that I am blind, and yet ask me what
thou shalt do for me? My answer is plain
in my misery; Lord, that I may receive my
sight. I needed not to make the applica-
tion. And from this time, although I lay four
months in prison after this, and heard no
more of it, yet from this time, as I learned
afterwards, this noble person made it his
business to have my case represented to her
Majesty, and methods taken for my deliver-
ance.” Queen Anne, as he elsewhere tells
us, expressed great concern when she under-
stood the truth of Defoe's case; she said
expressly, “that she left all that matter to
a certain person, and did not think he would
use him thus,” and sent through the trea-
surer Godolphin “a considerable supply.”
for his wife and family. Harley, becoming
almost immediately afterwards secretary of
state, Defoe was discharged from confine-
ment, and received from the Queen money
enough to pay his fine and the expences of
the discharge.
On being set free he retired with his
family to St. Edmond's Bury which he has
in his travels called “ the Montpelier of
England,” to recruit his strength after his
long confinement, by the genial air and
exercise of the country. His Review, how-
ever, continued to be published regularly;
and various separate works which appeared
about this time attest his unwearied zeal
and industry. “ The Consolidator, or
Memoirs of sundry Transactions from the
World of the Moon,” is the chief of these,
a prose satire by no means in his best style,
but which possessed power enough to excite
the rage of the Swedish Ambassador, on
account of some sarcastic reflections it con-
tained against the mad policy of Charles XII.
The formal complaint lodged against him by
his excellency did not however produce any
effect with the government." But “ the
High Church Legion,” an attack on Dr. Drake,
a champion of the tories, had gone near to
prove more injurious to him. Towards the
end of the year he made a journey to Exeter
on matters of business, and some of his
enemies hearing of this, made an attempt,
which we can scarcely read of without
wonder at the present time, to have him
impressed for a soldier. Compulsory enlist-
ments for the land service were then as usual as
they have ever been for the sea service; but
the audacity that could make any one think
of subjecting to such treatment a freeholder
* The Consolidator is one of the last of Defoe's writings
a reader of the present day could find pleasure in ; but it
deserves notice, if on no other account, for this reason,
that it certainly contains the first hints of many of the ideas
which Swift many years afterwards embodied in Gulliver,
particularly in his account of Laputa, the book-making
machine, &c. &c. It contains moreover a great many
bye-hits against all the authors of the time, from Dryden
to Tom Durfey.
VOL. I. C
of England, and a liveryman of London, (to
say nothing of Defoe's higher and still more
personal qualities)—cannot fail to excite our
utmost surprise and disgust. As a trait of
the manners of the times, the incident is
abundantly deserving of notice. But Defoe's
address and resolution were not so easily
to be overcome. He was brought before a
magistrate as a vagabond, but struck such
awe into him by his mode of answering, that
he was instantly set free. All the circum-
stances of this remarkable transaction were
immediately detailed in the Review, but for
which authority it would scarcely have
been possible for us to believe such things
had really occurred so lately within this
island.
“Giving alms no charity,” is another
separate publication of the same year, called
forth by a bill for employing the poor,
brought into parliament by Sir Humphrey
Mackworth. It is singular with what acute-
ness Defoe describes and exposes in this
tract very many of those evils of the
poor rate system, which have in our day
come to such a height, as to form the sub-
ject of most serious concern to all that
consider the state of these realms. The
absurdity of interfering by legislative enact-
ments with the direction of the industry
of individuals is demonstrated with all
the power of our author's mind and lan-
guage; but some other things which he de-
monstrates with apparently scarce inferior
distinctness lead to strange comparisons be-
tween the state of England in those days, and
in ours; as, for example, in his own words,
“That there is in England more labour than
hands to perform it, and consequently a want
of people, not of employment;”— and that
“No man in England can be poor, merely
for want of employment.” These expressions
recall in a very striking manner the immense
increase in our population during the last
century; and the still more extraordinary
change that has occurred in the character of
our population. At the end of the same year,
he had a paper war with Lord Haversham, a
great speech-maker of those days; whose
speech in parliament, on the state of the nation,
had strongly excited his wrath. Here, as in
all his political writings, one of Defoe's most
powerful weapons is personal satire. At the
close of one of his pamphlets or broadsides (as
Swift called them), he says happily, in allusion
to the different fortunes of his opponent and
himself, “Fate, that makes footballs of men,
kicks some up, some down; some are advanced
c 2
without honour, some suppressed without
infamy; some are raised without merit, some
are crushed without a crime; and no man
knows from the beginning of things, whether
his course shall issue in a PEERAGE or a
PILLoRY " —The beginning of the next year
(1706) produced Defoe's longest and worst
poetical production, “Jure Divino, a satire
in twelve books.” The justice of his arguments
cannot in general be disputed, though a
strange mixture of religious bigotry deforms
throughout his right notions on the subject of
civil liberty; but nothing can be more dull
and unreadable than this bulky octavo.
Dryden’s Hind and Panther suggested the
work; but Defoe did ill when he presumed to
tread in the footsteps of Dryden. His per-
formance has no pretensions to the only
qualities that made Dryden's political poetry
succeed—its purpose was good, and it displays
sometimes vigour of language, as well as of
thought; but it wants all the graces of
“The varying verse, the full resounding line,
The long majestic march, and energy divine.”
The best two lines in the whole, are perhaps
these, although they are not the smoothest:
&g
He is a fool, and must be ruled by slaves,
That may be king of freemen, and would be king
of slaves.” -
By these various productions, the character
of Defoe as a writer, (if not as a poet,) was
raised and established; and his importance
was fairly acknowledged by his enemies; and
what he probably considered as scarcely less
singular, by his friends. The treasurer Godol-
phin had embraced Harley's high opinion of
him, and continued to hold it, even after he
quarrelled with that first patron of Defoe. By
this minister he was at least twice introduced
into the presence of Queen Anne herself, with
whom his manners seem to have ingra-
tiated him, as they had before with King
William. He was employed by her majesty,
or her government, in what he calls “several
honourable though secret services,” the exact
nature of which we cannot now ascertain,
though from what we know of his after-history,
we may believe the description he gives of
them to be not at all exaggerated. During this
period, he avoided having any intercourse
with Harley entirely, with a view to prevent
Godolphin from entertaining any suspicions of
his secrecy; nor did Harley misunderstand or
resent in any manner this conduct, which at
first sight might look like ingratitude. To-
wards the conclusion of the year, the ability
he had shewn in these minor matters, recom-
mended him as a fit person to be sent down
c 3
to Scotland, to lend assistance in the great
affair of the union. His history of the intrigues
which preceded the completion of this long
desired conjunction of the two crowns, which
he published soon after his return from
Scotland, must always be read with the most
lively interest; it is minute to excess; but
that is no fault; and the keen, energetic, and
penetrating mind it displays, leaves in us no
wonder at the choice of Godolphin and his
mistress. It appears from the opening of this
history, that long before he had conversed
with King William on the subject of the
union; but indeed it is sufficiently obvious,
that the subject must have engaged for many
years a chief share of the attention of all who
had any part in the administration of the
British government, or took any lead in the
criticism of its measures. The History of the
Union was reprinted handsomely, in quarto,
in the year 1786, with a preface on the pro-
priety of an union with Ireland, by Delolme,
and the life of Defoe by George Chalmers.
During this visit to Scotland, his active
mind appears to have been busily engaged in
gathering stores of information concerning
the history and condition of that country;
both of which subjects had, up to that period,
attracted, comparatively speaking, no consider-
able portion of attention from the people of
the sister kingdom. Defoe, in his quality of a
sincere and zealous dissenter from the Church
of England, was attracted, not repelled by
most of those circumstances of national faith
and manners, which were disagreeable to the
English writers, who had hitherto treated of
the affairs of Scotland; and so, without doing
any violence to his own feelings, he laboured
effectually by his representations to remove
the barriers of antipathy between the nations.
He seems to have made diligent journeys over
most parts of the northern kingdom, and has
left a picture of her then state, which cannot
be perused without the highest interest, by
those who are acquainted with the face of
Scotland now.” Her institutions, civil and
religious, he has described with all the fulness
of partiality—her cities and palaces graphi-
cally and distinctly. For the romantic beauties
of the Scottish soil, which have chiefly found
favour in the eyes of subsequent travellers,
Defoe however appears to have had small
relish; and the readers of the present tasteful
age will smile at the cockney prejudices which
break out in his remarks, on many pieces of

till 1723.
c 4
scenery which have since been immortalized
in song and tale, and are trod every year by
the feet of so many hundreds of enthusiastic
tourists from the country of Daniel Defoe.
Inter alia (for one example is as good as a
thousand), he expresses much astonishment
at the choice of situation for the castle of
Drumlanrig in Dumfries-shire: but who would
guess the circumstances that displeased the
fastidious critic P “It is placed upon a rock
and among mountains, in a very coarse country.”
Such were the eyes with which Defoe gazed on
the beautiful valley of the Nith, and its ma-
jestic cincture of heath-clad hills. Another
of his works, the materials of which were
gathered at this period, although it also was
published some years afterwards, is the His-
tory of the Church of Scotland, a very
valuable book, evincing research of no com-
mon order, and written in a style of felicity
even beyond what is common in its author.
His narrative of the earlier part of the event-
ful history of the Presbyterian Church may
be perused with pleasure even by those who
have lived to see the same period treated of
by the greatest historical writer of the present
day, Dr. M'Crie ; while his representations
of the more recent troubles in the time of
the Covenanters, his descriptions of the
battles of Claverhouse, and the cruelties of
the persecution under James II., need scarcely
shrink from a comparison with some of the
most picturesque passages in the first Tales
of my Landlord. When we consider the
character and tendency of these works, we
cannot help being surprised to find that
neither of them have ever been republished
in Scotland. Without doubt they might have
formed an acceptable addition to the elegant
edition of Defoe's novels, which issued some
years ago from the press of the Ballantynes.
As for CALEDoNIA, an encomiastic effusion
in verse, which Defoe published during his
residence in the Scottish capital, if its flattery
pleased those for whom it was written, it
must be admitted that this was all it deserved.
The utmost zeal of national partiality could
not now revive its forgotten dulness.
His services in Scotland to those who sent
him thither were important. He attended the
committees of parliament in Edinburgh, and
made calculations on subjects of trade and
taxation for the ministers. He incurred
many personal dangers by the fidelity with
which he performed what was entrusted to
him. He was mobbed in the streets, and had
his windows broken, and on one occasion
escaped with difficulty by the care of his
friends. Of these occurrences, however, we
have no account, except a few hints in his
own History of the Union. He returned to
London as soon as the great affair was
settled; and had a pension of some kind, but
of what value we know not, assigned to him
by Lord Godolphin. That the discharge of
some duties of a fixed nature was the con-
dition of this allowance from the Queen's
purse, we know ; but are equally ignorant
what those duties were. Whatever they were,
he continued to discharge them, and to re-
ceive their reward, by the advice of Godol-
phin himself, after that minister's expulsion
from office in the next year; and from this
we may infer they were of some very subor-
dinate character. The History of the Union,
and the History of Addresses (a work com-
piled in order to abate the fervour against
Sacheverel), attest that those duties did not
engross his time. During the whole of his
residence in Scotland he furnished the ma-
terials for the Review ; and he continued it
during this period also with unabated dili-
gence. There is reason to suppose that his
worldly circumstances were now pretty com-
fortable, for he describes himself as writing his
Reviews in a “nice retirement” at Newington,
a pleasant situation, endeared to him as we
have seen by the recollections of his boyish
years. There were not wanting enemies, who, in
order to destroy the effect of Defoe's writings,
afterwards asserted that during this period his
pen had been employed in the composition of
tory tracts and pamphlets, the implied con-
dition, as they would have us to understand,
of the continuance of his allowance. But we
shall soon have to notice a most speaking in-
stance of the falseness of these charges. When
Harley himself, bred in revolution principles,
first came into power, he did so indeed by
the aid of the tory party; but he had neither
espoused their principles in their full extent,
nor did he consent to any thing like a total
expulsion of the whigs from office; for this
last part of his policy, indeed, as our readers
may remember, he was some years afterwards
severely blamed by Swift in the celebrated
“FreeThoughts on the State of publicAffairs.”
But the minister's object, no doubt, was to
strengthen his own power, by carrying along
with him as many of the more moderate whigs
as he could detach from Godolphin's party;
and if he failed ultimately in the attainment
of this object, the blame was more imputable
to the fiery and audacious temper of his col-
league Bolingbroke, than to himself. As yet,
however, Bolingbroke himself had not entirely
forgotten the whig principles, in which he
also had been educated ; or if such a change
had taken place in his mind, it was not sus-
pected even by those who knew him best.
Defoe in truth, less than any one, either of the
political rulers of that period, or even than any
of its political writers, seems to have merited
the blame of versatility in political principle;
he wrote against the peace of Utrecht, al-
though by doing so, he must have known he
was thwarting Harley in the dearest and most
important of all his measures; yet his honesty
does not appear even in this delicate instance
to have lost him the protection of the minister.
He wrote shortly after three pamphlets against
the Pretender*, the irony of which being again
totally misunderstood by the whigs, called
down upon him the full vengeance of that
party in parliament. It is not to be imagined
that Harley or Bolingbroke could misunder-

stand the purpose of these tracts; and it is
a circumstance very honourable to them, that
while the whig leaders, whose cause Defoe
was serving, did all they could to crush him,
they, whose friends were really attacked by
him, exerted themselves in his behalf. A pro-
secution was commenced against him; and
some expressions he made use of in defending
himself in his Review, having displeased the
Court of King's Bench, he was committed to
Newgate. But Harley procured him the
Queen's pardon; and Bolingbroke it appears
joined in the application to her Majesty. The
whigs abused the ministers for this protection
of Defoe, “an open jacobite:” but Defoe
said in his own way and with justice, “they
might as well have called me a Mahometan.”
Disgusted with the stupidity of the party
whom he had so long served, and who had now
done all they could to injure him—disgusted,
it is easy to believe with the profession of a
regular political writer, which had now twice
brought him to the verge of ruin — Defoe
dropt his Review during this his second con-
finement in Newgate, as nine years before he
bad commenced it, to occupy his own mind
and to support his family, in the solitude of
the same prison. A few separate political
tracts were published by him after his dis-
charge ; but he was already more than half
sick of the trade. In the beginning of 1715,
he wrote his “ Appeal to Honour and Justice;”
a plain, manly, and convincing defence of
his own political life; and being struck with
an apoplexy immediately on finishing it,
it was published by his friends during the
period of his slow and uncertain recovery
from the effects of this calamitous visita-
tion. His pension, whatever it was, died
with the administration of Bolingbroke, and
the accession of the Elector of Hanover.
For writing in behalf of the Hanoverian
succession he had already undergone the
pains of persecution and imprisonment, and
now he was a loser not a gainer by the
triumph of that cause for which he had done
and suffered so much. But why should we
waste words in complaining of things that
afterwards contributed so largely to the
fortune and fame of Defoe himself, and were
productive of so great service to the litera-
ture of his country The close of his poli-
tical life was in truth the beginning of
Defoe's greatness; in the retirement which he
now quitted no more, the leisure of his active
spirit was occupied in the creation of a
series of works which raised his name im-
measureably higher than it had ever been
before in the opinion of his cotemporaries,
and which will preserve that name in fresh-
ness and honour so long as the language in
which they are written endures; so long as
penetration, wit, genius, and eloquence
preserve their place in the estimation of
mankind. The rapidity with which these,
the best and greatest of Defoe's works,
followed each other into the world, after
he had got fairly into the vein of composing
them, is a sufficient proof not only of the ex-
traordinary fertility of his mind, but that he
now possessed undisturbed quiet, wherein to
call out and employ with uniform zeal and
success all its manifold resources. From the
point of time at which Robinson Crusoe was
published, down to the death of Defoe, which
occurred in the year 1731, almost the only
incidents that mark the progress of the
author's history, are the successive appear-
ances of the new works produced in his retire-
ment. From a single circumstance or two
indeed it appears, that though he almost en-
tirely dropt politics, he had still retained some
little occasional hankerings after the more
active pursuits of commerce. Among other
speculations, he had at one time a lease of a
farm, but we find him soon after disposing of it.
Defoe, the truth of the matter is, was now
perhaps too much of an author to be able to
succeed in any thing but authorship : book-
making was his trade, and he considered it
as such, carrying into it all the strength of
his mind in all its varieties of operation;
exerting to the utmost his power as a crea-
tive genius, under the direction of a most
acute and sagacious judgment, which very
seldom misled him into any unfertile or
unfortunate path of exertion. It is on the
whole rarely that we meet in the whole
course of the history of literature, with any
thing at all resembling this last part of the
career of Defoe. Men who possess that
force and fire of fancy requisite for the
striking out of new ways and species for
themselves, are most commonly persons of so
much delicacy of temperament, that they
can comparatively seldom bring themselves
to the labour of exerting their faculties to
the full. After producing one work, or a few
works, by which they conceive themselves to
have sufficiently exhibited their power and
secured their fame, they slumber over the
embers which they will not arouse them-
selves to blow, and allow the fire they might
have kept bright and blazing to be smothered
under the ashes of indolence. Our own
literary history indeed, more than that of any
othermodern nation, furnishes splendid excep-
tions to this rule, both in past times and in the
present; and of these Defoe must ever
continue to be esteemed one of the most
illustrious.
The state of his worldly circumstances
must, without doubt, be reckoned among the
chief incentives of his extraordinary dili-
gence. In all the works of Defoe we find
the impress of a mind accustomed to find
delight in the occupation of the world, to
participate with a lively interest in the ordi-
nary business, and pleasures, and recreations
of mankind. Had he been possessed of an
independent fortune, it is very probable he
might have spent his time with pleasure to
himself, as he certainly would with all ad-
vantage to those about him, in these the
common functions and amusements of life,
without devoting any thing like so great a
portion of his days and nights to the labours
of solitary meditation and composition. But
in the toil to which he was at first stimulated
by his necessities, who can doubt that he
soon came to find his most unfailing source
of pleasure—an inexhaustible source, which
might well atone to him for the loss of others,
less rich and less peculiar. The pleasure
and the excitement with which we still pe-
VOI,. I. d:
ruse his works, is only the dim shadow and
reflection of the more intense pleasure he
must have tasted in conceiving and creating
them. Book-making, in the hands of a dull
man, is the worst and the most degrading of all
drudgeries; in the hands of a Daniel Defoe
it changes its character, and becomes the
noblest and the most delightful of all possi-
ble occupations. Having acquired by long
practice the most perfect ease in the use of
his instruments, and having the possession
of an intellectual mine no less deep than
broad, the work of production was to him
scarcely a work — repaid as it already was,
(to say nothing of its after-rewards), by the
perpetual delights of conscious acquisition
and extended power. We sometimes hear
people expressing wonder that a great author
should “ take the trouble to write so
much;” and authors themselves of the me-
diocre class are the very people from whom
we most frequently hear this language.
With them composition is a task and a
toil, and they suppose that it is the same
with all men; as the heavy fowl that with
difficulty swings itself across the farm-yard,
may perhaps regard with wonder, if not with
pity, the perpetual unwearied soarings of
the “Bird of Jove.
The well-known story of Alexander Selkirk,
a poor Scotsman, who had lived for a long
course of years by himself on the island of
Juan Fernandez, being published in a pam-
phlet, and received with that interest the
extraordinary nature of its incidents de-
served, attracted the notice of Defoe soon
after he had desisted from his political
writings, and was the means of first directing
him to the species of composition on which
his chief fame was destined ultimately to rest.
The malice of some of his cotemporaries
suggested, that he had acquired possession,
by some accident, of Selkirk's own papers;
and that Robinson Crusoe was nothing but a
book-maker's extension of the deserted ma-
riner's own narrative. But for this there was
no ground. Robinson Crusoe is a most
skilful romance, of which the first idea indeed
was borrowed from the strange story of Alex-
ander Selkirk; , but in which the whole ar-
rangement and execution—all the filling up
of incident, reflection, and character—are
truly and entirely Defoe's : and the same sort
of criticism that would diminish the credit of
its author, would produce the same effect on
the authors of all the celebrated epic and
almost all the celebrated dramatic poems in
the world. He took no more of Robinson
d 2
Crusoe from Selkirk's story, than Shakespeare
did of Macbeth and Hamlet from the old
Scotch and Danish Chronicles; or of Romeo
and Juliet from the Italian ballad.
The Adventures of Captain Singleton—
The Life of Colonel Jacque—The Memoirs
of a Cavalier—The new Voyage round the
World—The History of the Plague in Lon-
don — The Religious Courtship — Moll
Flanders — Roxana — and some inferior
pieces of the same class, were all produced
in the course of a few years after the appear-
ance of Robinson Crusoe; and though none
of them has ever attained quite the same
measure of popularity, yet most of them are
not unknown to our readers; and all of them,
as they are aware, abound in the same pecu-
liarities of invention, interest, and manner,
which excited the admiration of the world
when Defoe's first romance was published,
and, along with it, the envy of such as would
fain have been his rivals. The success at-
tending such a series of works, soon raised
Defoe far above the effects of their idle
malignity. He held in his hands larger
means of gratifying the larger part of the
reading public of the day, than perhaps any
one of his cotemporaries: and in the use of
these means he was as indefatigable as he was
happy in their possession. He became in a
word, in spite of all they said or did, a British
classic in the noblest sense of that term, in
the universal estimation of his countrymen;
and such he ever has continued, and ever
must continue to be. Of works so well-
known as his masterpieces, it would at this
time of day be absurd to enter either into
any detailed account, or any formal criticism.
The titles and dates we leave to be gathered
from the list we have added of all his known
performances, and shall now proceed to sum
up our sketch with a few general remarks on
the peculiar character of Defoe as a writer,
more particularly as it is displayed in the
Novel to which these pages are prefixed.
The first thing that must strike every one
who compares him with any other writer of
fictitious narrative, is the unequalled intense
reality which he throws around every part of
his fiction. With such exquisite powers of
fancy and of wit as he possessed, no one ever
possessed the same command over himself—
to use these powers, wherever it was fit they
should be used, without suffering the pleasure
of employing them to lead into unnecessary
ornament. He never describes anything
merely for the sake of the description: every-
thing is strictly subservient to the main matter
d 3
in hand : nothing is omitted that can serve
the true and main purpose of the story :
nothing added only for the sake of displaying
the powers of the writer. Above all, in those
of his novels where the chief personage is
made to tell his own story, it is wonderful
what superiority this part of his skill gives
Defoe, even over authors of much higher
powers, in one sense of the word, than him-
self. Others may invent incidents of a more
happy nature, but it is the charm of Defoe
that, let his incidents be as common-place as
may be, we read them at the full stretch of
interest; simply because, for the moment, the
irresistible belief is upon us that these things
really occurred exactly as they are set down
in the book before us. Nobody ever skips
over a page or two in one of his tales, be-
cause he is in a hurry to get on, and suspects
that the story will be just as intelligible with-
out what he is passing over as with it. We
are bound to the page by the grave character
of history, at the same time that we read it
with the delight of happiest fiction. Every
thought that passed through the mind of the
hero is set down, and we feel that there
would be a want of candour in refusing to
see what it was ; we are gained over to his
side, even if he be a villain, by the honesty
with which he lets us into the secrets of his
inmost heart. The nature that is so com-
municative cannot be entirely depraved; the
charm of frankness and confidence over-
comes and subdues us. The reader is made
the father confessor of him that addresses
him, and it would be a breach of duty to turn
a deaf ear to any thing he has to say.
It is no easy matter however to decide by
what particular art Defoe has continued to
make his stories so much more real in their
aspect than any other novelist; the chief
secret, perhaps, is nothing but his delight in
giving all the details of the action or course
of thought he is engaged with. Other writers
give us the main points, and please us by the
opportunity they afford us of filling up the
interstices, by the exercise of our own ima-
ginations for ourselves. Such is not the way
of Defoe; he must be allowed to tell you all,
or he will tell you nothing: He stops in the
midst of the darkest horrors of the plague to
give a long account of some old woman steal-
ing beaver hats out of a warehouse; a trifling
matter surely, and not worthy for itself of
being told among the mass of black thoughts
and doings to which the moral corruption of
the pestilence gave rise. But then how com-
pletely this trifling circumstance establishes in
d 4
our minds the conviction that we are listening
to the narrative of a true and authentic eye-
witness; not of one that had heard of the
horrors of the plague, and is employing his
imagination to body forth a picture of which
the outline only had been supplied by his
memory; but of one that had walked the
streets of London during the awful visitation,
with all his personal feelings and interests
alive in his mind; surveying the dreary cala-
mity-struck city, with the eyes of a man and
a christian—but still remembering his own
concerns, and watching like a careful brother
over the safety of his absent brother's store-
shop. When the author of Tom Jones, or
Roderic Random, or Gil Blas, introduces one
of his characters, and gives you a full descrip-
tion of his person and attire, it is evidently
for the purpose of amusing us: when the
author of Waverly and Ivanhoe does so, it is
from the delight he feels in communicating
the vivacity of his own imagination to us, and
bestowing the freshness of things seen on the
phantoms of days gone by. When Defoe
does the same thing, it is because the nature
of the person in whose mouth he puts the de-
scription, is such as to make that an essential
part of his communication; we should rather
say of her communication, for he commonly
takes care to put such details into the mouth
of a female. Roxana, the vain, beautiful, high-
dressed Roxana, never mentions a beau or
a belle, but she must tell us the colour of his
breeches, or the pattern of her petticoat.
The coarser mind of Moll Flanders was never
caught by such trifles as these; but she dwells
on the full muscular outline of her Lancashire
husband's leg, and fills a dozen pages with
an account of the fat dishes they had at their
wedding supper in the inn. Robinson Crusoe
enumerates every nail he put into his cabin;
but then, whatever Robinson Crusoe had was
the work of his own ingenuity, and who can
wonder at the pride of his detail. The only
novelist that ever rivalled Defoe in this point
of his art, was Richardson; but that is not
the only particular in which Richardson is the
imitator of Defoe.
. It is not, however, by his circumstantiality
and spirit of minute detail alone, that Defoe
gives this unequalled effect of truth and reality
to his fiction. These are the first things that
strike the reader's fancy; but on laying down
any one of his works, it is felt irresistibly, that
the essence of the charm lies in something far
deeper than these. All other novelists, com-
pared with him, are more or less painters of
the ideal of human life; we do not mean of
the beau ideal, for that many of them totally
despise as well as he ; but of its ideal of ex-
citement. He paints not only the minute
items of human life and action exactly as they
are, but its whole scope and tenour also is
viewed and represented by him, and by him
alone, exactly as it is. Others carry their
heroes and heroines through all varieties of
fortune, but they continue every thing in
order to make the interest progressive, and
the last scene is always intended to be the ex-
quisitely interesting catastrophe of a through-
out interesting tale. Defoe on the other hand
always shews himself to be perfectly aware,
that the prosaic part of existence is far greater
than the poetic; that mountains are ever suc-
ceeded and separated by valleys; that the
most romantic avenue often conducts into a
dull and level wideness of plain; and that the
most picturesque of rivers expands into the
tameness of utility, before it melts into the
all-equalizing sea. — Instead therefore of la-
bouring to heighten the interest of one scene
above that which has gone before, he is con-
tented to make both natural, and never fears
but, if they be so, both will be sufficiently in-
teresting. His lovers are not always married;
nor do his duellists always escape. The same
laws by which men and things are governed
in the world, govern them in his representa-
tions of the world; an unforeseen storm sinks
the fairest vessel into the sea, with all her
equipment; absence cools the most ardent
lovers; time consoles the most despairing
mourners; the sonneteer burns his sonnets,
and learns to laughat himself; and the widow’s
heart is made to sing aloud for joy. His
women are never angels, nor his misers sen-
timental. Moll Flanders becomes a quiet
good body in Virginia; and the fair Roxana
dies in the Rasp-house at Amsterdam.
We have already seen what bad con-
sequences this intensely natural mode of
writing sometimes produced on the fortunes
of Defoe himself—we have seen him pilloried
once, and imprisoned twice, because his irony
was too exquisite to be understood by judge
or jury; we have seen the whigs persecuting
him because he wrote a satire on the tories.
It is no wonder, therefore, that the critics of
his day should have thought Robinson Crusoe
was made up from the papers of Alexander
Selkirk—that the Memoirs of a Cavalier should
have been quoted a hundred times, as an
authentic history—or that a map should have
been published, in which the track of his
New Voyage round the World was laid down
with the same accuracy as that of Captain
Cooke.
The writings of Daniel Defoe are valuable
on many accounts; but for nothing so much
as for the insight they give us into the true
character and habits of the English people,
as exemplified in walks of life little understood
or far less happily represented by the other no-
velists and painters of manners our island has
produced. Without reading and studying the
Religious Courtship in particular, the Complete
English Tradesman, and the Family Instructor,
no man can hope to understand thoroughly
the character and manners of the middle
classes of his countrymen. There cannot be
a more perfectly national writer than Defoe—
every thought of his, every word, every image
is intensely English; there is not one page in
his works, that does not remind one the
author was born in London, and lived in the
days of King William and Queen Anne. The
homely way in which he looks at every thing
— the sagacious scorn with which he regards
all pretences of the fine and the romantic—
his thorough-going citizen-like substantial
perception of the prudent and the seemly—
his broad buffeting style of sarcasm *—his
deep sincere masculine pathos — every thing
about him, and his “ round unvarnished
tales,” reminds us that he was a hosier on
Holborn Hill, - and makes us honour the
name of an English tradesman for the sake of
old Daniel Defoe. When he walks forth into
the country (and few of his works are more
delightful than his Travels through England
and Scotland), he carries all the prejudices of
the city life along with him, and describes
whatever he sees exactly as he might have done
by word of mouth to his next door neighbour
after returning from an actual trip in the way of
business. London, and London alone, he de-
scribes with all the warmth andfulness of a lover.
It is easy to see, that in her was centered his
idea of all human grandeur and magnificence;
and who shall say that he was mistaken.
Whig and dissenter as he was, no man loved
and reverenced all the old institutions of his
country more fervently than Daniel. He
* The best of Defoe's satirical performances, is Mars
stript of his Armour, 1709. This is one of the rarest of
his works; it contains a lashing caricature of the habits
and manners of all kinds of military men; and is written
throughout, as if on purpose to delight quiet trades-people,
and cure their daughters of their passion for red coats.
triumphs in describing the superior pomp and
dignity with which the Majesty of England
was surrounded at Whitehall; and half
forgets his puritanism beneath the vaults of
Westminster Abbey.—Nothing in the world
is finer than the impression of the old city of
London, before the fire, which one gathers
from his History of the Plague. Throughout
the whole of that most striking narrative, his
mind is visibly haunted with the idea, how
princely was the desolation of her grass-grown
streets—how awful the silence of her deserted
palaces and the fatal calmness of her shipless
river. The historian of the plague of London
was worthy of inspiring a poet—and he has
done so. -
Defoe's love for the sea, and the affairs of
the sea, was another strong and prevailing
part of his character as an Englishman; and
it is traceable more or less in almost all his
writings. Trade was his original destination,
and he understood it thoroughly in all its
branches; his study of the trade of his country
had filled him with a magnificent sense of her
ocean greatness; and no man could have
conceived some of the sublime meditations of
Robinson Crusoe, but a citizen of the Queen
of Isles. It is now a hundred years since
that book was written, and who shall say, how
many young hearts have in that time been
smitten by its means with their first love for the
element of their country's pride. Every English
lad that reads Robinson Crusoe has his little
canoe and his mimic ship, and so long as the
British Jack sweeps the sea, the youngest
boy that rocks upon the mast, will exhibit
there the usefulness of those lessons of reso-
lution and contempt of danger which he
owes to Robinson Crusoe. It is here, indeed,
that the chief value and chief merit of this
performance are to be found. The happy
imagination of the incidents of the mariner's
life, and the profound knowledge of man's
nature which is exhibited in the workings
of his solitary soul, even these would be
comparatively nothing, were it not for the
rich moral aim to which they are made
subservient. The superiority of man to all
external evils, his destination to contend
with difficulties, and his duty to sustain
them, and his pious humility in overcoming
them,-these are the ideas which this the most
moral of all Romances throughout displays
and inculcates. How happy that the book
which, as Dr. Johnson says, “no body ever
laid down without wishing it were longer,” is
not only the most charming of books, but
the most instructive.
The only one of Defoe's cotemporaries
who has given us any description of him, is
John Dunton the bookseller. According to
him, he was “a man of a conversation in-
genious and brisk — of a spirit bold and
enterprising — of good nature and real
honesty.” The character corresponds very
well with what we might infer from the
writings of the man. In spite of some pieces,
in which vice is painted so distinctly that it
almost looks as if it had been painted con
amore, there seems no reason to doubt that
his purposes were honest — that he was a
sincere Christian in his heart, and a devout
lover of his country's welfare. The defects
of his education, or rather the circumstances
of his birth and station, have given a strain
of coarseness to his style and manner which
must prevent him ever from being joined
with the purest classics of England; but for
richness of natural genius, for nature, elo-
quence, and for variety of useful knowledge,
it may be safely asserted that there are very
few among their number who can sustain :
any comparison with Daniel Defoe. He has
been much commended and much imitated;
but in many of his walks (for few writers ever
had more walks than he) he has never been
equalled.
Daniel Defoe closed his useful and labo-
rious life in St. Giles's, Cripplegate, the parish
where he was born, in April 1731, at the age
of 68. He left behind him two sons, of
whom one emigrated to Carolina: of the
other nothing is known. He left also three
daughters, one of whom was married to the
celebrated Henry Baker. It is not known
whether any of his race be still preserved,
either here or in America.

which perhaps were never made before, and that with infi-
nite labour.” Page 93.

ROBINSON CRUSOE IN HIS ISLAND DRESs.
“I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs, and a pair of open-
kneed breeches of the same: the breeches were made of a
skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length
on either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the mid-
dle of my legs.” Page 207.
PLATE VIII.
Robinson crusoe Discovers THE PRINT of A MAN's
FOOT.
“I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's
naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in
the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had
seen an apparition; I listened, I looked round me, I could
hear nothing, nor see anything.” Page 213.
PLATE IX.
ROBINSON CRUSOE TERRIFIED AT THE DYING GOAT.
“ Upon this I stepped forward again, and by the light
of the fire-brand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw
lying on the ground a monstrous frightful old he-goat, just
making his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying
indeed of a mere old age.” Page 247.
PLATE X.
ROBINSON CRUSOE FIRST SEES AND RESCUES HIS MAN
FRIDAY.
“Having knocked this fellow down, the other who
pursued him stopped, as if he had been frightened; and
I advanced apace towards him; but, as I came nearer, I
perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fit-
ting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot
at him first, which I did, and killed him at the first shot.”

PLATE XI.
ROBINSON CRUSOE AND FRIDAY MAKING A BOAT,
“I shewed him how rather to cut it out with tools, which,
after I had shewed him how to use, he did very handily;
and, in about a month's hard labour, we finished it, and
made it very handsome.” Page 817.
PLATE XII.
ROBINSON CRUSOE AND FRIDAY MAKING A TENT TO LODGE
FRIDAY's FATHER AND THE SPAN IARD.
“. Friday and I carried them up both together between
us; but, when we got them to the outside of our wall or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before, for it
was impossible to get them over; and I was resolved not
to break it down, so I set to work again, and Friday and
I, in about two hours time, made a very handsome tent,
covered with old sails, and above that, with boughs of
trees.” Page 336.

let them know who I was ; upon which they all came up

“The two men had innumerable young trees planted
about their hut, that when you came to the place, nothing

plantation twice demolished, once by their own countrymen,
and once by the enemy, as shall be shewn in its place; yet
they had restored all again, and every thing was flourishing
and thriving about them.” Page 102.

would scarce burn; however, the fire so burned the upper
part, that it soon made them unfit for swimming in the sea
as boats.” Page 128.

TO THE
F I R S T E D IT I O N.
If ever the story of any private man's adven-
tures in the world were worth making pub-
lic, and were acceptable when published, the
Editor of this account thinks this will be so.
The wonders of this man’s life exceed all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the
life of one man being scarce capable of a
greater variety.
The story is told with modesty, with se-
riousness, and with a religious application of
events to the uses to which wise men always
apply them; viz. to the instruction of others,
by this example, and to justify and honour
the wisdom of Providence in all the variety
of our circumstances, let them happen how
they will.
-
The Editor believes the thing to be a just
history of facts; neither is there any appear-
ance offiction in it; and however thinks, be-
cause all such things are disputed, that the
improvement of it, as well to the diversion, as
to the instruction of the Reader, will be the
same; and as such, he thinks, without further
compliment to the world, he does them a
great service in the publication.
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
&c.
I was born in the year 1682, in the city of York,
of a good family, though not of that country, my
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at Hull; he got a good estate by merchandize,
and leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York;
from whence he had married my mother, whose
relations were named Robinson, a very good family
in that country, and from whom I was called
Robinson Kreutznaer; but by the usual corruption
of words in England, we are now called, nay we
call ourselves, and write our name Crusoe, and so
my companions always called me.
I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieu-
tenant colonel to an English regiment of foot in
WOL. I. B
Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous colo-
nel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dun-
kirk against the Spaniards; what became of my
second brother I never knew, any more than my
father or mother did know what was become of me.
Being the third son of the family, and not bred
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early
with rambling thoughts: my father, who was very
ancient, had given me a competent share of learning,
as far as house education, and a country free-school
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ;
and my inclination to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay the commands of my father, and
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be
something fatal in that propension of nature tending
directly to the life of misery which was to befal me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious
and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was
my design. He called me one morning into his
chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and
expostulated very warmly with me upon this sub-
ject: he asked me what reasons more than a mere
wandering inclination I had for leaving my father's
house and my native country, where I might be
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my
fortune by application and industry, with a life of
ease and pleasure. He told me it was for men of
desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring su-
perior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon
adventures, to rise by enterprize, and make them-
selves famous in undertakings of a nature out of
the common road; that these things were all either
too far above me, or too far below me; that mine
was the middle state, or what might be called the
upper station of low life, which he had found by
long experience was the best state in the world, the
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings
of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embar-
rassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy
of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might
judge of the happiness of this state, by this one
thing, viz. That this was the state of life which all
other people envied; that Kings have frequently
lamented the miserable consequences of being born
to great things, and wish they had been placed in
the middle of the two extremes, between the mean
and the great; that the wise man gave his testi-
mony to this as the just standard of true felicity
when he prayed to have neither poverty or riches.
He bid me observe it, and I should always find,
that the calamities of life were shared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the mid-
dle station had the fewest disasters, and was not
exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind; nay, they were not sub-
jected to so many distempers and uneasinesses
either of body or mind, as those were, who by
vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and
B 2
mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring
distempers upon themselves by the natural conse-
quences of their way of living; that the middle
station of life was calculated for all kind of virtues
and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty
were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society,
all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures,
were the blessings attending the middle station of
life; that this way men went silently and smoothly
through the world, and comfortably out of it, not
embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of
the head, not sold to the life of slavery for daily
bread, or harassed with perplexed circumstances,
which rob the soul of peace, and the body of rest;
not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in
easy circumstances sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living,
without the bitter, feeling that they are happy, and
learning by every day’s experience to know it
more sensibly.
After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the
most affectionate manner, not to play the young
man, not to precipitate myself into miseries which
nature and the station of life I was born in seemed
to have provided against; that I was under no ne-
cessity of seeking my bread; that he would do
well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into
the station of life which he had been just recom-
mending to me; and that if I was not very easy
and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate
or fault that must hinder it, and that he should
have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged
his duty in warning me against measures which
he knew would be to my hurt: in a word, that as
he would do very kind things for me if I wöuld
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to
give me any encouragement to go away : and to
close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an
example, to whom he had used the same earnest
persuasions to keep him from going into the low
country wars, but could not prevail, his young de-
sires prompting him to run into the army, where
he was killed; and though he said he would not
cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say
to me, that if I did take this foolish step, GoD
would not bless me, and I would have leisure here-
after to reflect upon having neglected his counsel
when there might be none to assist in my re-
covery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse,
which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my
father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I
observed the tears run down his face very plenti-
fully, and especially when he spoke of my brother
who was killed; and that when he spoke of my
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he
was so moved, that he broke off the discourse, and
told me, his heart was so full, he could say no
more to me.
B 3
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as
indeed who could be otherwise 2 and I resolved
not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle.
at home according to my father’s desire. But alas!
a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent
any of my father's further importunities, in a few
weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act so hastily neither as my
first heat of resolution prompted, but I took my
mother, at a time when I thought her a little plea-
santer than ordinary, and told her, that mythoughts
were so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that
I should never settle to any thing with resolution
enough to go through with it, and my father had
better give me his consent than force me to go
without it; that I was now eighteen years old,
which was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or
clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, if I did, I
should never serve out my time, and I should cer-
tainly run away from my master before my time
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to
my father to let me go but one voyage abroad, if I
came home again and did not like it, I would go
no more, and I would promise by a double dili-
gence to recover that time I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion: she
told me, she knew it would be to no purpose to
speak to my father upon any such subject; that he
knew too well what was my interest to give his
consent to any thing so much for my hurt, and
that she wondered how I could think of any
such thing after such a discourse as I had had with
my father, and such kind and tender expressions
as she knew my father had used to me; and that
in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help
for me; but I might depend I should never have
their consent to it; that for her part she would
not have so much hand in my destruction; and I
should never have it to say, that my mother was
willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my
father, yet, as I have heard afterwards, she reported
all the discourse to him, and that my father, after
shewing a great concern at it, said to her with a
sigh, “That boy might be happy if he would stay
at home, but if he goes abroad, he will be the most
miserable wretch that was ever born; I can give
no consent to it.”
It was not till almost a year after this that I
broke loose, though in the mean time I continued
obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to busi-
ness, and frequently expostulating with my father
and mother about their being so positively deter-
mined against what they knew my inclinations
prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where
I went casually, and without any purpose of mak-
ing an elopement that time; but I say, being there,
and one of my companions being going by sea to
London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to
go with them, with the common allurement of sea-
faring men, viz. That it should cost me nothing
for my passage, I consulted neither father or mo-
B 4
ther any more, not so much as sent them word of
it: but leaving them to hear of it as they might,
without asking God's blessing, or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or con-
sequences, and in an ill hour, GoD knows, on the
first of September 1651, I went on board a ship
bound for London: never any young adventurer’s
misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten
out of the Humber, but the wind began to blow,
and the waves to rise in a most frightful manner;
and as I had never been at sea before, I was most
inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind:
I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had
done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judg-
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father's
house, and abandoning my duty; all the good
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my
mother's entreaties came now fresh into my mind,
and my conscience, which was not yet come to the
pitch of hardness to which it has been since, re-
proached me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea,
which I had never been upon before, went very
high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since; no, nor like what I saw a few days
after: but it was enough to affect me then, who
was but a young sailor, and had never known any
thing of the matter. I expected every wave would
have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship
fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow
of the sea, we should never rise more; and in this
agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions,
that if it would please God here to spare my life
this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon
dry land again I would go directly home to my
father, and never set it into a ship again while I
lived; that I would take his advice, and never
run myself into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observa-
tions about the middle station of life, how easy,
how comfortably he had lived all his days, and
never had been exposed to tempests at sea, or
troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would,
like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my
father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next day the wind was abated and
the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to
it: however I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and
a charming fine evening followed; the sun went
down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morn-
ing; and having little or no wind, and a smooth
sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I
thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with
wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible
the day before, and could be so calm and so plea-
sant in so little time after. And now, lest my
good resolutions should continue, my companion
who had indeed inticed me away, comes to me,
• Well, Bob,” says he, (clapping me upon the
shoulder,) “how do you do after it? I warrant you
were frighted, wan’t you, last night, when it blew
but a cap full of wind?” “A cap full do you call it?”
said I. “It was a terrible storm.” “A storm, you
fool you,” replies he, “do you call that a storm 2
why it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship
and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a
squall of wind as that; but you’re but a fresh-water
sailor, Bob: come, let us make a bowl of punch,
and we’ll forget all that: do you see what charm-
ing weather it is now * To make short this sad part
of my story, we went the old way of all sailors;
the punch was made, and I was made drunk with
it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned
all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past
conduct, and all my resolutions for my future. In
a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness
of surface and settled calmness by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the cur-
rent of my former desires returned, I entirely for-
got the vows and promises that I made in my dis-
tress. I found indeed some intervals of reflection,
and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour
to return again sometimes, but I shook them off,
and roused myself from them as it were from a
distemper, and applying myself to drink and
company, soon mastered the return of those fits,
for so I called them, and I had in five or six days
got as complete a victory over conscience as any
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with
it could desire. But I was to have another trial
for it still ; and Providence, as in such cases gene-
rally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without
excuse. For if I would not take this for a deli-
verance, the next was to be such a one as the worst
and most hardened wretch among us would con-
fess both the danger and the mercy. -
The sixth day of our being at sea we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come
to an anchor, and here welay, the wind continuing
contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight
days, during which time a great many ships from
Newcastle came into the same roads, as the com-
mon harbour where the ships might wait for a
wind for the river.
We had not however rid here so long, but should
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew
too fresh; and after we had lain four or five days,
blew very hard. However the roads being reck-
oned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good,
and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were
unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of
danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea; but the eighth day in the
morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands
at work to strike our top-masts, and make every
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as
easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high
indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped seve-
ral seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor
had come home; upon which our master ordered
out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two
anchors a-head, and the cables veered out to the
better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed;
and now I began to see terror and amazement in
the faces even of the seamen themselves. The
master, though vigilant in the business of preserv-
ing the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin
by me, I could hear him softly to himself say
several times, ‘Lord, be merciful to us, we shall be
all lost, we shall be all undone;” and the like. Du-
ring these first hurries, I was stupid, lying still in
my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot
describe my temper: I could ill re-assume the first
penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon,
and hardened myself against: I thought the bitter-
ness of death had been past, and that this would
be nothing like the first. But when the master
himself came by me, as I said just now, and said
we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted; I
got up out of my cabin, and looked out; but such
a dismal sight I never saw : the sea went moun-
tains high, and broke upon us every three or four
minutes: when I could look about, I could see
nothing but distress round us: two ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board,
being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a
ship which rid about a mile a-head of us was foun-
dered. Two more ships being driven from their
anchors, were run out of the roads to sea, at all
adventures, and that with not a mast standing.
The light ships fared the best, as not so much la-
bouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove,
and came close by us, running away with only their
spritsail out before the wind.
Towards evening the mate and boatswain beg-
ged the master of our ship to let them cut away
the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do:
but the boatswain protesting to him, that if he did
not, the ship would founder, he consented; and
when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-
mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much,
they were obliged to cut her away also, and make
a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I must be
in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who
had been in such a fright before at but a little.
But if I can express at this distance the thoughts
I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more
horror of mind upon account of my former con-
victions, and the having returned from them to
the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than
I was at death itself; and these, added to the ter-
ror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that
I can by no words describe it. But the worst was
not come yet: the storm continued with such fury,
that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had
never known a worse. We had a good ship, but
she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that
the seamen every now and then cried out, she
would founder. It was my advantage in one re-
spect, that I did not know what they meant by
founder, till I enquired. However, the storm was
so violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the
master, the boatswain, and some others more sen-
sible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting
every moment when the ship would go to the bot-
tom. In the middle of the night, and under all
the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had
been down on purpose to see, cried out, we had
sprung a leak; another said there was four foot
water in the hold. Then all hands were called to
the pump. At that very word my heart, as I thought,
died within me, and I fell backwards upon the side
of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However,
the men roused me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump
as another: at which I stirred up, and went to the
pump and worked very heartily. While this was
doing, the master seeing some light colliers, who,
not able to ride out the storm, were obliged to slip
and run away to sea, and would not come near us,
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I who
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised,
that I thought the ship had broke, or some dread-
ful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised
that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time
when every body had his own life to think of, no-
body minded me, or what was become of me; but
another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting
me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had
been dead; and it was a great while before I came
to myself.
We worked on, but the water increasing in the
hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder;
and though the storm began to abate a little, yet
as it was not possible she could swim till we might
run into a port, so the master continued firing
guns for help; and a light ship who had rid it out
just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us.
It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near
us, but it was impossible for us to get on board, or
for the boat to lie near the ship's side; till at last,
the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their
lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over
the stern with the buoy to it, and then veered it
out a great length, which they after great labour
and hazard took hold of, and we hauled them close
under our stern and got all into their boat. It was
to no purpose for them or us after we were in the
boat to think of reaching to their own ship, so all
agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in
towards shore as much as we could, and our master
promised them, that if the boat was staved upon
shore he would make it good to their master: so
partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went
away to the northward, sloping towards the shore
almost as far as Winterton-Ness. -
We were not much more than a quarter of an
hour out of our ship before we saw her sink, and then
I understood for the first time what was meant by
a ship foundering in the sea; I must acknowledge
I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told
me she was sinking; for from that moment they
rather put me into the boat than that I might be
said to go in : my heart was as it were dead within
me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind,
and the thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the
shore, we could see (when our boat mounting the
waves we were able to see the shore) a great many
people running along the shore to assist us when
we should come near, but we made but slow way
towards the shore, nor were we able to reach the
shore, till being past the light-house at Winterton,
the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer,
and so the land broke off a little the violence of the
wind: here we got in, and, though not without
much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked
afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfor-
tunate men, we were used with great humanity, as
well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned
us good quarters, as by particular merchants and
owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient
to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as
we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's pa-
rable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for
hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he
had any assurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obsti-
nacy that nothing could resist; and though I had
several times loud calls from my reason and my
more composed judgment to go home, yet I had
no power to do it. I know not what to call this,
nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree
that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own
destruction, even though it be before us, and that
we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly
nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery
attending, and which it was impossible for me to
escape, could have pushed me forward against the
calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired
thoughts, and against two such visible instructions
as I had met with in my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me be-
fore, and who was the master's son, was now less
forward than I; the first time he spoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three days, for we were separated in the town to
several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered; and looking very me-
lancholy, and shaking his head, asked me how I
did, and telling his father who I was, and how I
VOL. I. C
*
had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to
go farther abroad; his father turning to me with
a very grave and concerned tone, Young man,
says he, you ought never to go to sea any more;
you ought to take this for a plain and visible token
that you are not to be a seafaring man. Why,
Sir, said I, will you go to sea no more ? That is
another case, said he, it is my calling, and there-
fore my duty; but as you made this voyage for a
trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you
of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps
this is all befallen us on your account, like Jonah
in the ship of Tarshish. Pray, continued he, what
are you? and on what account did you go to sea?
Upon that I told him some of my story; at the
end of which he burst out with a strange kind of
passion; What had I done, says he, that such an
unhappy wretch should come into my ship ! I
would not set my foot in the same ship with thee
again for a thousand pounds. This indeed was,
as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were
yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was far.
ther than he could have authority to go. How-
ever he afterwards talked very gravely to me,
exhorted me to go back to my father and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a
visible hand of Heaven against me; and, young
man, said he, depend upon it, if you do not go
back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing
but disasters and disappointments, till your father's
words are fulfilled upon you.
We parted soon after; for I made him little an-
swer, and I saw him no more; which way he went,
I know not. As for me, having some money in
my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and
there, as well as on the road, had many struggles
with myself, what course of life I should take, and
whether I should go home, or go to sea.
As to going home, shame opposed the best mo-
tions that offered to my thoughts; and it imme-
diately occurred to me how I should be laughed
at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed
to see, not my father and mother only, but even
every body else; from whence I have since often
observed, how incongruous and irrational the
common temper of mankind is, especially of youth,
to that reason which ought to guide them in such
cases, viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and
yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the
action for which they ought justly to be esteemed
fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only
can make them be esteemed wise men. -
In this state of life however I remained some
time, uncertain what measures to take, and what
course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance
continued to going home; and as I stayed a while,
the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore
off; and as that abated, the little motion I had in
my desires to a return wore off with it, till at last
I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked
out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me first away
C 2
from my father's house, that hurried me into the
wild and indigested notion of raising my fortune;
and that imprest those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to
the entreaties and even the command of my father:
I say, the same influence, whatever it was, pre-
sented the most unfortunate of all enterprizes to
my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to
the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call
it, a voyage to Guinea. -
It was my great misfortune that in all these ad-
ventures I did not ship myself as a sailor; whereby
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learned
the duty and office of a fore-mast man; and in
time might have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not for a master. But as it was
always my fate to choose for the worse, so I did
here; for having money in my pocket, and good
clothes upon my back, I would always go on board
in the habit of a gentleman; and so I neither had
any business in the ship, or learned to do any. .
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to such loose and unguided young fellows as I then
was; the devil generally not omitting to lay some
snare for them very early: but it was not so with
me. I first fell acquainted with the master of a
ship who had been on the coast of Guinea; and
who having had very good success there, was re-
solved to go again; and who taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at
that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the
world, told me if I would go the voyage with him
I should be at no expence; I should be his mess-
mate and his companion, and if I could carry any
thing with me, I should have all the advantage of
it that the trade would admit; and perhaps I might
meet with some encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict
friendship with this captain, who was an honest
and plain-dealing man, I-went the voyage with
him, and carried a small adventure with me, which
by the disinterested honesty of my friend, the cap-
tain, I increased very considerably; for I carried
about 40l. in such toys and trifles as the captain
directed me to buy. This 40l. I had mustered
together by the assistance of some of my relations
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe,
got my father, or at least my mother, to contribute
so much as that to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe
to the integrity and honesty of my friend the cap-
tain, under whom also I got a competent know-
ledge of the mathematics, and the rules of naviga-
tion, learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to un-
derstand some things that were needful to be un-
derstood by a sailor: for, as he took delight to in-
struct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word,
this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant:
C 3
for I brought home 5 pounds 9 ounces of gold dust
for my adventure, which yielded me in London at
my return, almost 800l., and this filled me with
those aspiring thoughts which have since so com-
pleted my ruin.
Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes
too; particularly, that I was continually sick, being
thrown into a violent calenture by the excessive
heat of the climate; our principal trading being
upon the coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees
north even to the line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again,
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who
was his mate in the former voyage, and had now
got the command of the ship. This was the un-
happiest voyage that ever man made; for though
I did not carry quite 100l. of my new gained
wealth, so that I had 200l. left, and which I lodged
with my friend’s widow, who was very just to me,
yet I fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage ;
and the first was this, viz. Our ship making her
course towards the Canary Islands, or rather be-
tween those islands and the African shore, was
surprised in the grey of the morning, by a Turkish
rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the
sail she could make. We crowded also as much
canvass as our yards would spread, or our masts
carry, to have got clear; but finding the pirate
gained upon us, and would certainly come up with
us in a few hours, we prepared to fight; our ship
having 12 guns, and the rogue 18. About three
in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing
to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of
athwart our stern, as he intended, we brought eight
of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in a
broadside upon him, which made him sheer off
again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also
his small shot from near 200 men which he had
on board. However, we had not a man touched,
all our men keeping close. He prepared to attack
us again, and we to defend ourselves; but laying
us on board the next time upon our other quarter,
he entered 60 men upon our decks, who immedi-
ately fell to cutting and hacking the decks and
rigging. We plied them with small shot, half.
pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared
our deck of them twice. However, to cut short
this melancholy part of our story, our ship being
disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car-
ried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to
the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the coun-
try to the emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of the rover, as
his proper prize, and made his slave, being young
and nimble, and fit for his business. At this sur-
prising change of my circumstances, from a mer-
chant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly over-
C 4
whelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be mise-
rable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought
was now so effectually brought to pass, that I could
not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven had
overtaken me, and I was undone without redemp-
tion. But, alas! this was but a taste of the misery
I was to go through, as will appear in the sequel
of the story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would some time or other be his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war; and
that then I should be set at liberty. But this hope
of mine was soon taken away; for when he went
to sea, he left me on shore to look after his little
garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves
about his house; and when he came home again
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin
to look after the ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my escape; and
what method I might take to effect it; but found
no way that had the least probability in it: nothing
presented to make the supposition of it rational;
for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotsman, there but myself; so that
for two years, though I often pleased myself with
the imagination, yet I never had the least encou-
raging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the old thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head:
my patron lying at home longer than usual, with-
out fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for
want of money, he used constantly, once or twice
a week, sometimes oftener, if the weather was fair,
to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the
road a fishing; and as he always took me and a
young Maresco with him to row the boat, we
made him very merry, and I proved very dexte-
rous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he
would send me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen,
and the youth, the Maresco as they called him, to
catch a dish of fish for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing in a
stark calm morning, a fog rose so thick, that
though we were not half a league from the shore,
we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not
whither or which way, we laboured all day, and
all the next night, and when the morning came
we found we had pulled off to sea instead of pull-
ing in for the shore; and that we were at least
two leagues from the shore: however we got well
in again, though with a great deal of labour, and
some danger; for the wind began to blow pretty
fresh in the morning; but particularly we were all
very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, resolved
to take more care of himself for the future; and
having lying by him the long boat of our English
ship he had taken, he resolved he would not go a
fishing any more without a compass and some pro-
vision ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship,
who also was an English slave, to build a little
state-room or cabin in the middle of the long-boat,
like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind
it to steer and hale home the main-sheet; and room
before for a hand or two to stand and work the
sails; she sailed with what we call a shoulder of
mutton sail; and the boom gibed over the top of
the cabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in
it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a
table to eat on, with some small lockers to put in
some bottles of such liquor as he thought fit to
drink; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.
We went frequently out with this boat a fishing,
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened that he
had appointed to go out in this boat, either for
pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of
some distinction in that place, and for whom he
had provided extraordinarily; and had therefore
sent on board the boat over night a larger store of
provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me to
get ready three fusees with powder and shot, which
were on board his ship; for that they designed
some sport of fowling, as well as fishing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and
waited the next morning with the boat washed
clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his guests; when by and
by my patron came on board alone, and told me
his guests had put off going, upon some business
that fell out, and ordered me with the man and
boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and catch
them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at
his house; and commanded that as soon as I got
some fish I should bring it home to his house; all
which I prepared to do. 4.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was
like to have a little ship at my command; and my
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself,
not for fishing business, but for a voyage; though
I knew not, neither did I so much as consider,
whither I should steer; for any where to get out
of that place was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub-
sistence on board; for I told him we must not
presume to eat of our patron’s bread: he said, that
was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit of their kind, and three jars with fresh
water into the boat. I knew where my patron’s
case of bottles stood, which it was evident by the
make were taken out of some English prize; and
I conveyed them into the boat while the Moor
was on shore, as if they had been there before for
our master; I conveyed also a great lump of bees-
wax into the boat, which weighed above half a
hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or thread,
a hatchet, a saw, and a hammer, all which were of
great use to us afterwards; especially the wax to
make candles. Another trick I tried upon him,
which he innocently came into also ; his name
was Ismael, who they call Muly, or Moley; so I
called to him, Moley, said I, our patron's guns are
on board the boat, can you not get a little powder
and shot, it may be we may kill some Alcamies (a
fowl like our curlews) for ourselves, for I know
he keeps the gunner's stores in the ship : Yes,
says he, I’ll bring some; and accordingly he
brought a great leather pouch which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and
another with shot, that had five or six pounds,
with some bullets, and put all into the boat ; at
the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one
of the large bottles in the case, which was almost
empty; pouring what was in it into another: and
thus furnished with every thing needful, we sailed
out of the port to fish. The castle which is at the
entrance of the port knew who we were, and took
no notice of us; and we were not above a mile
out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and set
us down to fish: the wind blew from the N.N.E.
which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown
southerly I had been sure to have made the coast
of Spain, and at least reached to the bay of Cadiz;
but my resolutions were, blow which way it would,
I would be gone from that horrid place where I
was, and leave the rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and catched no-
thing, for when I had fish on my hook I would
not pull them up, that he might not see them; I
said to the Moor, this will not do, our master will
not be thus served, we must stand farther off: he
thinking no harm agreed, and being in the head
of the boat set the sails; and as I had the helm I
run the boat out near a league farther, and then
brought her to as if I would fish, when giving the
boy the helm, I stept forward to where the Moor
was, and making as if I stooped for something
behind him, I took him by surprise with my arm
under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard
into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam
like a cork, and calling to me, begged to be taken
in, told me he would go all over the world with
me; he swam so strong after the boat that he
would have reached me very quickly, there being
but little wind; upon which I stept into the cabin,
and fetching one of the fowling pieces, I presented
it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt,
and if he would be quiet I would do him none:
but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the
shore, and the sea is calm, make the best of your
way to shore, and I will do you no harm, but if
you come near the boat I’ll shoot you through the
head; for I am resolved to have my liberty: so he
turned himself about and swam for the shore, and
I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this
Moor with me, and have drowned the boy, but
there was no venturing to trust him. When he was
gone I turned to the boy, who they called Xury,
and said to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to
me I’ll make you a great man, but if you will not
stroke your face to be true to me, that is, swear
by Mahomet and his father's beard, I must throw
you into the sea too: the boy smiled in my face,
and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust
him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all
over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim-
ming, I stood out directly to sea with the boat,
rather stretching to windward, that they might
think me gone towards the Straits mouth (as in-
deed any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do), for who would have
supposed we were sailed on to the southward to
the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations of
negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes,
and destroy us; where we could never once go on
shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts,
or more merciless savages of human kind.
But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little toward the east,
that I might keep in with the shore; and having
a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I
made such sail that I believe by the next day at
three o’clock in the afternoon, when I first made
the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south
of Sallee; quite beyond the emperor of Morocco's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts,
for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the
Moors, and the dreadful apprehensions I had of
falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or
go on shore, or come to an anchor. The wind con-
tinuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five
days, and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels
were in chace of me, they also would now give
over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and
came to an anchor in the mouth of a little river,
I knew not what, or where; neither what latitude,
what country, what nation, or what river: I nei-
ther saw, or desired to see any people, the princi-
pal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came
into this creek in the evening, resolving to swim
on shore as soon as it was dark, and discover the
country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard
such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and
howling of wild creatures of we knew not what
kinds, that the poor boy was ready to die with fear,
and begged of me not to go on shore till day.
Well, Xury, said I, then I wont, but it may be we
may see men by day, who will be as bad to us as
those lions. Then we give them the shoot gun,
says Xury, laughing; make them run wey. Such
English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves.
However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful,
and I gave him a dram (out of our patron's case
of bottles) to cheer him up: after all, Xury's ad-
vice was good, and I took it; we dropped our little
anchor and lay still all night; I say still, for we
slept none; for in two or three hours we saw vast
great creatures (we knew not what to call them)
of many sorts, come down to the sea-shore and run
into the water, wallowing and washing themselves
for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they
made such hideous howlings and yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was
I too; but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of these mighty creatures come swim-
ming towards our boat: we could not see him, but
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
strous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was a
lion, and it might be so for aught I know ; but
poor Xury cried to me to weigh the anchor and
row away. No, says I, Xury, we can slip our cable
with a buoy to it and go off to sea, they cannot
follow us far. I had no sooner said so, but I per-
ceived the creature (whatever it was) within two
oars length, which something surprised me; how-
ever I immediately stept to the cabin-door, and
taking up my gun fired at him, upon which he
immediately turned about, and swam towards the
shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the horrible
noises, and hideous cries and howlings, that were
raised, as well upon the edge of the shore, as higher
within the country, upon the noise or report of
the gun; a thing I have some reason to believe
those creatures had never heard before : this con-
vinced me that there was no going on shore for
us in the night upon that coast, and how to ven-
ture on shore in the day was another question too;
for to have fallen into the hands of any of the
savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the
hands of lions and tigers; at least we were equally
apprehensive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
shore somewhere or other for water, for we had
not a pint left in the boat; when or where to get
to it was the point. Xury said, if I would let him
go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if
there was any water and bring some to me. I
asked him why he would go? why I should not
go and he stay in the boat? The boy answered
with so much affection that made me love him ever
after. Says he, If wild mans come, they eat me,
you go wey. Well, Xury, said I, we will both
go, and if the wild mans come, we will kill them,
they shall eat neither of us; so I gave Xury a
piece of rusk-bread to eat, and a dram out of our
patron’s case of bottles which I mentioned before ;
and we hauled the boat in as near the shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on shore; carrying
nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of the boat,
fearing the coming of canoes with savages down
the river: but the boy seeing a low place about a
mile up the country rambled to it; and by and by
I saw him come running towards me. I thought
VOL. I. p
he was pursued by some savage, or frighted with
some wild beast, and I ran forward towards him
to help him, but when I came nearer to him, I
saw something hanging over his shoulders, which
was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but
different in colour, and longer legs; however we
were very glad of it, and it was very good meat;
but the great joy that poor Xury came with, was
to tell me he had found good water, and seen no
wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take
such pains for water; for a little higher up the
creek where we were, we found the water fresh
when the tide was out, which flowed but a little
way up; so we filled our jars and feasted on the
hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
way, having seen no foot-steps of any human
creature in that part of the country.
As I had been one voyage to this coast before,
I knew very well that the islands of the Canaries,
and the Cape de Verd islands also, lay not far off
from the coast. But as I had no instruments to
take an observation to know what latitude we were
in, and did not exactly know, or at least remem-
ber, what latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to stand off to
sea towards them; otherwise I might now easily
have found some of these islands. But my hope
was, that if I stood along this coast till I came to
that part where the English traded, I should find
some of their vessels upon their usual design of
trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, that place where
I now was, must be that country, which lying be-
tween the emperor of Morocco's dominions and
the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except
by wild beasts; the Negroes having abandoned
it, and gone farther south for fear of the Moors;
and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting,
by reason of its barrenness; and indeed both for-
saking it because of the prodigious number of
tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures
which harbour there; so that the Moors use it for
their hunting only, where they go like an army,
two or three thousand men at a time ; and indeed
for near an hundred miles together upon this coast,
we saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country
by day; and heard nothing but howlings and roar-
ing of wild beasts by night.
Once or twice in the day-time I thought I saw
the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the
mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries; and had a
great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching
thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in
again by contrary winds, the sea also going too
high for my little vessel, so I resolved to pursue
my first design and keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land for fresh
water, after we had left this place; and once in
particular, being early in the morning, we came
to an anchor under a little point of land which was
pretty high, and the tide beginning to flow, we lay
still to go farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more
D 2
about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to
me, and tells me that we had best go farther off
the shore; for, says he, look yonder lies a dread-
ful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep.
I looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful
monster indeed, for it was a terrible great lion that
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a
piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over
him. Xury, says I, you shall go on shore and kill
36 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
eat me at one mouth ; one mouthful he meant.
However, I said no more to the boy, but bade him
lie still; and took our biggest gun, which was
almost musquet-bore, and loaded it with a good
charge of powder, and with two slugs, and laid it
down; then I loaded another gun with two bul- .
lets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I
loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best
aim I could with the first piece, to have shot him
into the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a
little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about
the knee, and broke the bone. He started up
growling at first, but finding his leg broke fell
down again, and then got up upon three legs, and
gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard. I
was a little surprised that I had not hit him on
the head; however, I took up the second piece
immediately, and, though he began to move off,
fired again, and shot him into the head, and had
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little
noise, but lay struggling for life. Then Xury

took heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
Well, go, said I. So the boy jumped into the water,
and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore
with the other hand, and coming close to the crea-
ture, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and
shot him into the head again, which dispatched
him quite. -
This was game indeed to us, but this was no
food: and I was very sorry to lose three charges
of powder and shot upon a creature that was good
for nothing to us. However, Xury said he would
have some of him ; so he comes on board, and
asked me to give him the hatchet. For what,
Xury 2 said I. Me cut off his head, said he.
However, Xury could not cut off his head, but he
cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was
a monstrous great one. -
I bethought myself however, that perhaps the
skin of him might one way or other be of some
value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin, if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him ;
but Xury was much the better workman at it, for
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us
up both the whole day; but at last we got off the
hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our
cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two days time,
and it afterwards served me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the southward
continually for ten or twelve days, living very
sparing on our provisions, which began to abate
very much, and going no oftener into the shore
D 3
than we were obliged to for fresh water: my de-
sign in this was, to make the river Gambia or Se-
negal, that is to say, any where about the Cape de
Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some
European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what
course I had to take, but to seek for the Islands,
or perish there among the Negroes. I knew that
all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to
the coast of Guinea or to Brasil, or to the East In-
dies, made this Cape, or those Islands; and, in a
word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
single point, either that I must meet with some
ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten
days longer, as I have said, I began to see that the
land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as
we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore
to look at us; we could also perceive they were
quite black, and stark naked. I was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was
my better counsellor, and said to me, No go, no
go: however I hauled in nearer the shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they ran along
the shore by me a good way. I observed they had
no weapons in their hands, except one, who had a
long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance,
and that they would throw them a great way with
good aim. So I kept at a distance, but talked with
them by signs as well as I could; and particularly
made signs for something to eat: they beckoned
to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me
some meat; upon this I lowered the top of my
sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the
country, and in less than half an hour came back,
and brought with them two pieces of dry flesh
and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what the one nor
the other was: however, we were willing to accept
it, but how to come at it was our next dispute, for
I was not for venturing on shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a
safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore
and laid it down, and went and stood a great way
off till we fetched it on board, and then came close
to us again. -
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
offered that very instant to oblige them wonder-
fully; for while we were lying by the shore, came
two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as
we took it) with great fury, from the mountains
towards the sea: whether it was the male pursuing
the female, or whether they were in sport or in
rage, we could not tell, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe
it was the latter; because, in the first place, those
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night;
and in the second place, we found the people ter-
ribly frighted, especially the women. The man
that had the lance or dart did not fly from them,
but the rest did ; however, as the two creatures
ran directly into the water, they did not seem to
D 4
offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged
themselves into the sea, and swam about as if they
had come for their diversion. At last one of them
began to come nearer our boat than at first I ex-
pected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded
my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury
load both the others. As soon as he came fairly
within my reach, I fired, and shot him directly
into the head. Immediately he sunk down into
the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and
down as if he was struggling for life; and so in-
deed he was: he immediately made to the shore,
but between the wound, which was his mortal hurt,
and the strangling of the water, he died just be-
fore he reached the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures at the noise and the fire of my
gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear,
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to
the shore, they took heart and came to the shore,
and began to search for the creature. I found him
by his blood staining the water; and by the help
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and
found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted
and fine to an admirable degree, and the Negroes
held up their hands with admiration to think what
it was I had killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire
and the noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran
up directly to the mountains from whence they
came, nor could I at that distance know what it
was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eat-
ing the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to
have them take it as a favour from me, which
when I made signs to them that they might take
him, they were very thankful for. Immediately
they fell to work with him, and though they had
no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they
took off his skin as readily, and much more readily,
than we could have done with a knife: they offered
me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as
if I would give it them, but made signs for the
skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought
me a great deal more of their provision, which
though I did not understand, yet I accepted; then
I made signs to them for some water, and held out
one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward,
to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted to
have it filled. They called immediately to some
of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as
I suppose, in the sun; this they set down for me,
as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars,
and filled them all three. The women were as
stark naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such
as it was, and water: and, leaving my friendly
Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days
more, without offering to go near the shore, till I
saw the land run out a great length into the sea,
at about the distance of four or five leagues before
me; and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing to make this point: at length, doubling the
point at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side to seaward; then I
concluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this
was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands, called
from thence Cape de Verd Islands. However,
they were at a great distance, and I could not well
tell what I had best to do, for if I should be taken
with a fresh of wind I might neither reach one nor
the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stept
into the cabin and set me down, Xury having the
helm, when on a sudden the boy cried out, Master,
master, a ship with a sail! and the foolish boy was
frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs be
some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when
I knew we were gotten far enough out of their
reach. I jumped out of the cabin, and immedi-
ately saw not only the ship, but what she was, (viz.)
that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought,
was bound to the coast of Guinea for Negroes.
But when I observed the course she steered, I was
soon convinced they were bound some other way,
and did not design to come any nearer to the
shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as
much as I could, resolving to speak with them if
possible.
With all the sail I could make, I found I should
not be able to come in their way, but that they
would be gone by before I could make any signal
to them. But after I had crowded to the utmost,
and began to despair; they, it seems, saw me by
the help of their perspective-glasses, and that it
was some European boat, which, as they supposed,
must belong to some ship that was lost; so they
shortened sail to let me come up. I was encou-
raged with this, and as I had my patron’s ancient
on board, I made a waft of it to them for a signal
of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw;
for they told me they saw the smoke, though they
did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they
very kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me, and in
about three hours time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and
in Spanish, and in French; but I understood none
of them ; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on
board, called to me, and I answered him, and told
him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee.
Then they bade me come on board, and very kindly
took me in, and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
would believe that I was thus delivered, as I
esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost
hopeless condition as I was in, and immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a
return for my deliverance; but he generously told
me, he would take nothing from me, but that all
I had should be delivered safe to me when I came
to the Brasils; for, says he, I have saved your
life on no other terms than I would be glad to be
saved myself; and it may one time or other be my
lot to be taken up in the same condition: Besides,
said he, when I carry you to the Brasils, so great
a way from your own country, if I should take
from you what you have, you will be starved there,
and then I only take away that life I have given.
No, no, Seignior Inglese, says he, Mr. Englishman,
I will carry you thither in charity, and those things
will help you to buy your subsistence there, and
your passage home again.
As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle, for he ordered
the seamen, that none should offer to touch any
thing I had ; then he took every thing into his
own possession, and gave me back an exact inven-
tory of them, that I might have them; even so
much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship’s use, and asked me what I would have for it?
I told him, he had been so generous to me in every
thing, that I could not offer to make any price of
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of his hand
to pay me 80 pieces of eight for it at Brasil; and
when it came there, if any one offered to give
more, he would make it up; he offered me also 60
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I
was loth to take; not that I was not willing to
let the captain have him, but I was very loth to
sell the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so
faithfully in procuring my own. However, when
I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just,
and offered me this medium, that he would give
the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years,
if he turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury say-
ing he was willing to go to him, I let the captain
have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brasils, and
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos, or All-
Saints-Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And
now I was once more delivered from the most mi-
serable of all conditions of life, and what to do
next with myself I was now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me,
I can never enough remember; he would take
nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty
ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused
every thing I had in the ship to be punctually de-
livered me; and what I was willing to sell he
bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I
had made candles of the rest; in a word, I made
about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and with
this stock I went on shore in the Brasils.
I had not been long here, but being recom-
mended to the house of a good honest man like
himself, who had an Ingenio as they call it; that
is, a plantation and a sugar house, I lived with
him some time, and acquainted myself by that
means with the manner of their planting and mak-
ing of sugar; and seeing how well the planters
lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved,
if I could get license to settle there, I would turn
planter among them, resolving in the mean time
to find out some way to get my money, which I
had left in London, remitted to me. To this pur-
pose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization,
I purchased as much land that was uncured as my
money would reach, and formed a plan for my
plantation and settlement, and such a one as might
be suitable to the stock which I proposed to my-
self to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but
born of English parents, whose name was Wells,
and in much such circumstances as I was. I call
him neighbour, because his plantation lay next to
mine, and we went on very sociably together. My
stock was but low, as well as his ; and we rather
planted for food, than any thing else, for about
two years. However, we began to increase, and
our land began to come into order; so that the
third year we planted some tobacco, and made each
of us a large piece of ground ready for planting
canes in the year to come; but we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than before, I had
done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.
But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did
right, was no great wonder: I had no remedy but
to go on; I was gotten into an employment quite
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the
life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my
father's house, and broke through all his good ad-
vice; nay, I was coming into the very middle
station, or upper degree of low life, which my fa.
ther advised me to before; and which if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home,
and never have fatigued myself in the world as I
had done: and I used often to say to myself, I
could have done this as well in England among
my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off
to do it, among strangers and savages in a wilder-
ness, and at such distance as never to hear from
any part of the world that had the least knowledge
of me.
In this manner I used to look upon my condition
with the utmost regret. I had nobody to converse
with, but now and then this neighbour: no work
to be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I
used to say, I lived just like a man cast away upon
some desolate island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been, and how should
all men reflect, that, when they compare their pre-
sent conditions with others that are worse, Hea-
ven may oblige them to make the exchange, and
be convinced of their former felicity, by their ex-
perience; I say how just has it been, that the truly
solitary life I reflected on in an island of mere de-
solation should be my lot, who had so often un-
justly compared it with the life which I then led,
in which, had I continued, I had in all probability
been exceeding prosperous and rich.
I was in some degree settled in my measures
for carrying on the plantation, before my kind
friend the captain of the ship, that took me up at
sea, went back; for the ship remained there, in
providing his loading, and preparing for his voy-
age, near three months; when telling him what
little stock I had left behind me in London, he
gave me this friendly and sincere advice: Seignor
Inglese, says he, (for so he always called me) if you
will give me letters, and a procuration here in
form to me, with orders to the person who has
your money in London, to send your effects to
Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in
such goods as are proper for this country, I will
bring you the produce of them, God willing, at
my return; but since human affairs are all subject
to changes and disasters, I would have you give
orders but for one hundred pounds sterling, which
you say is half your stock, and let the hazard be
run for the first; so that if it come safe, you may
order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry,
you may have the other half to have recourse to
for your supply.
This was so wholesome advice, and looked so
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was
the best course I could take; so I accordingly pre-
pared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had
left my money, and a procuration to the Portu-
guese captain, as he desired.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full ac-
count of all my adventures, my slavery, escape,
and how I had met with the Portugal captain at
sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what con-
dition I was now in, with all other necessary
directions for my supply; and when this honest
captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some
of the English merchants there, to send over, not
the order only, but a full account of my story, to
a merchant at London, who represented it effec-
tually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered
the money, but out of her own pocket sent the
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his
humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred
pounds in English goods, such as the captain had
written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon,
and he brought them all safe to me to the Brasils;
among which, without my direction (for I was too
young in my business to think of them) he had
taken care to have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and
utensils necessary for my plantation, and which
were of great use to me.
When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune
made, for I was surprised with joy of it; and my
good steward the captain had laid out the five
pounds which my friend had sent him for a pre-
sent for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a
servant under bond for six years service, and would
not accept of any consideration, except a little to-
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of
my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
VOI. I. E
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize,
and things particularly valuable and desirable in
the country, I found means to sell them to a very
great advantage, so that I may say I had more
than four times the value of my first cargo, and
was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour, I
mean in the advancement of my plantation ; for
the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave, and
an European servant also ; I mean another besides
that which the captain brought me from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so was it
with me. I went on the next year with great
success in my plantation : I raised fifty great rolls
of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had
disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours;
and these fifty rolls, being each of above an hun-
dred weight, were well cured and laid by against
the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now,
increasing in business and in wealth, my head be-
gan to be full of projects and undertakings beyond
my reach ; such as are indeed often the ruin of the
best heads in this business.
Had I continued in the station I was now in, I
had room for all the happy things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet retired life, and of which he had
so sensibly described the middle station of life to
be full; but other things attended me, and I was
still to be the wilful agent of all my own miseries;
and particularly to increase my fault, and double
the reflections upon myself, which in my future
sorrows I should have leisure to make. All these
miscarriages were procured by my apparent obsti-
nate adhering to my foolish inclination of wander-
ing abroad, and pursuing that inclination in con-
tradiction to the clearest views of doing myself
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects
and those measures of life, which nature and Pro-
vidence concurred to present me with, and to
make my duty.
As I had done thus in breaking away from my
parents, so I could not be content now, but I must
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to
pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I
cast myself down again into the deepest gulph of
human misery that ever man fell into, or perhaps
could be consistent with life and a state of health
in the world.
To come then by the just degrees to the parti-
culars of this part of my story; you may suppose,
that having now lived almost four years in the
Brasils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very
well upon my plantation, I had not only learned
the language, but had contracted acquaintance and
friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as
among the merchants at St. Salvadore, which was
our port; and that in my discourses among them,
I had frequently given them an account of my two
E 2
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of
trading with the Negroes there, and how easy it
was to purchase upon the coast, for trifles, such as
beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits of glass,
and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains,
elephants teeth, &c. but Negroes for the service of
the Brasils, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into, but
as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal,
and engrossed in the public, so that few Negroes
were bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company with some mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talk-
ing of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me the next morning, and told me they
had been musing very much upon what I had dis-
coursed with them of the last night, and they came
to make a secret proposal to me; and after enjoin-
ing me secrecy, they told me, that they had a
mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they
had all plantations as well as I, and were strait-
ened for nothing so much as servants; that as it
was a trade could not be carried on, because they
could not publicly sell the Negroes when they
came home; so they desired to make but one voy-
age, to bring the Negroes on shore privately, and
divide them among their own plantations; and in
a word, the question was, whether I would go their
supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part
upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that
I should have my equal share of the Negroes, with-
out providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed,
had it been made to any one that had not had a
settlement and plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to be very con-
siderable, and with a good stock upon it. But for
me, that was thus entered and established, and had
nothing to do but go on as I begun, for three or
four years more, and to have sent for the other
hundred pounds from England, and who in that
time, and with that little addition, could scarce
have failed of being worth three or four thousand
pounds sterling, and that increasing too; for me
to think of such a voyage, was the most prepos-
terous thing that ever man in such circumstances
could be guilty of
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them
I would go with all my heart, if they would under-
take to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct
if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and
entered into writings or covenants to do so; and
I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation
E 8
and effects, in case of my death, making the cap-
tain of the ship that had saved my life as before,
my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose of
my effects as I had directed in my will, one half
of the produce being to himself, and the other to
be shipped to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my effects, and keep up my plantation; had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own
interest, and have made a judgment of what I
ought to have done, and not to have done, I had
certainly never gone away from so prosperous an
undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a
thriving circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to
sea, attended with all its common hazards; to say
nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular
misfortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reason: and
accordingly the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour, the 1st of September, being the same day
eight years that I went from my father and mother
at Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority,
and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about 120 ton burthen, carried 6
guns, and 14 men, besides the master, his boy and
myself; we had on board no large cargo of goods,
except of such toys as were fit for our trade with the
negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd
trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scis-
sars, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail,
standing away to the northward upon our own
coast, with design to stretch over for the African
coast, when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of
northern latitude, which it seems was the manner
of their course in those days. We had very good
weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon our
own coast, till we came the height of Cape St.
Augustino; from whence keeping farther off at
sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were
bound for the isle Fernand de Noronha, holding
our course N. E. by N. and leaving those isles on
the east. In this course we passed the line in about
twelve days time, and were by our last observation
in 7 degrees 22 min. northern latitude, when a
violent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of
our knowledge: it began from the south-east, came
about to the north-west, and then settled into the
north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve days together we could do
nothing but drive; and scudding away before it,
let it carry us whither ever fate and the fury of the
winds directed; and during these twelve days, I
need not say that I expected every day to be swal-
lowed up, nor indeed did any in the ship expect to
save their lives.
In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and
one man and the boy washed overboard. About
E 4 *
the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the
master made an observation as well as he could,
and found that he was in about 11 degrees north
latitude, but that he was 22 degrees of longitude
difference west from Cape St. Augustino; so that
he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guinea,
or the north part of Brasil, beyond the river Ama-
zones, toward that of the river Oronoque, commonly
called the Great River, and began to consult with
me what course he should take, for the ship was
leaky and very much disabled, and he was going
directly back to the coast of Brasil.
I was positively against that; and looking over
the charts of the sea-coasts of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited country for
us to have recourse to, till we came within the
circle of the Caribbee-islands, and therefore re-
solved to stand away for Barbadoes, which by
keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the bay
or gulph of Mexico, we might easily perform, as
we hoped, in about fifteen days sail; whereas we
could not possibly make our voyage to the coast
of Africa without some assistance, both to our ship
and to ourselves. -
With this design we changed our course, and
steered away N. W. by W. in order to reach some
of our English islands, where I hoped for relief;
but our voyage was otherwise determined; for being
in the latitude of 12 deg. 18 min. a second storm
came upon us, which carried us away with the
same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of
the very way of all human commerce, that had all
our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather
in danger of being devoured by savages than ever
returning to our country. -
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men early in the morning cried out,
land! and we had no sooner ran out of the cabin
to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the
world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand,
and in a moment, her motion being so stopped,
the sea broke over her in such a manner, that we
expected we should all have perished immediately;
and we were immediately driven into our close
quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and
spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one, who has not been in
the like condition, to describe or conceive the con-
sternation of men in such circumstances: we knew
nothing where we were, or upon what land it was
we were driven, whether an island or the main,
whether inhabited or not inhabited ; and as the
rage of the wind was still great, though rather
less than at first, we could not so much as hope to
have the ship hold many minutes without breaking
in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle
should turn immediately about. In a word, we
sat looking one upon another, and expecting death
every moment, and every man acting accordingly
as preparing for another world, for there was little
or nothing more for us to do in this: that which
was our present comfort, and all the comfort we
had, was, that contrary to our expectation the ship
did not break yet, and that the master said the
wind began to abate. -
Now though we found that the wind did a little
abate, yet the ship having thus struck upon the
sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her
getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed,
and had nothing to do but to think of saving our
lives as well as we could. We had a boat at our
stern, just before the storm, but she was first staved
by dashing against the ship's rudder, and in the
next place she broke away, and either sunk or was
driven off to sea, so there was no hope from her;
we had another boat on board, but how to get her
off into the sea was a doubtful thing : however,
there was no room to debate, for we fancied the
ship would break in pieces every minute, and some
told us she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the
men, they got her slung over the ship's side, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed our-
selves, being eleven in number, to God’s mercy,
and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated
considerably, yet the sea went dreadful high upon
the shore, and might well be called, den wild zee,
as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal indeed; for
we all saw plainly, that the sea went so high, that
the boat could not live, and that we should be in-
evitably drowned. As to making sail, we had
none, nor, if we had, could we have done any thing
with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to exe-
cution: for we all knew, that when the boat came
nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we
committed our souls to God in the most earnest
manner, and the wind driving us towards the shore,
we hastened our destruction with our own hands,
pulling as well as we could towards land.
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whe-
ther steep or shoal, we knew not; the only hope
that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation, was, if we might happen into some bay
or gulph, or the mouth of some river, where by great
chance we might have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.
But there was nothing of this appeared; but as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the land looked
more frightful than the sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling a-stern of us, and
plainly bade us expect the coup-de-grace. In a
word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset
the boat at once; and separating us, as well from
the boat as from one another, gave us not time
hardly to say, O God! for we were all swallowed
up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water; for
though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver
myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till
that wave having driven me, or rather carried me
a vast way on towards the shore, and having spent
itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost
dry, but half dead with the water I took in. I had
so much presence of mind as well as breath left,
that seeing myself nearer the main land than I ex-
pected, I got upon my feet, and endeavoured to
make on towards the land as fast as I could, before
another wave should return and take me up again.
But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it;
for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great
hill, and as furious as an enemy which I had no
means or strength to contend with ; my business
was to hold my breath, and rise myself upon the
water, if I could : and so by swimming to preserve
my breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore,
if possible: my greatest concern now being that
the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards
the shore when it came on, might not carry me
back again with it when it gave back towards the
Sea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once 20 or 30 foot deep in its own body; and I
could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
swiftness towards the shore, a very great way;
but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to
burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt my-
self rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found


my head and hands shoot out above the surface of
the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved
me greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I
was covered again with water a good while, but
not so long but I held it out; and finding the
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck
forward against the return of the waves, and felt
ground again with my feet. I stood still a few
moments to recover breath, and till the water went
from me, and then took to my heels, and run with
what strength I had farther towards the shore.
But neither would this deliver me from the fury
of the sea, which came pouring in after me again,
and twice more I was lifted up by the waves and
carried forwards as before, the shore being very
flat.
The last time of these two had well near been
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along
as before, landed me, or rather dashed me against
a piece of a rock, and that with such force, as it
left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my
own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and
breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my
body; and had it not returned again immediately,
I must have been strangled in the water; but I
recovered a little before the return of the waves,
and seeing I should be covered again with the
water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the
rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the
wave went back. Now as the waves were not so
high as at first, being near land, I held my hold
till the wave abated, and then fetched another run,
which brought me so near the shore, that the next
wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swal-
low me up as to carry me away; and the next run
I took I got to the main land, where, to my great
comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the shore,
and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger,
and quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began
to look up and thank God that my life was saved
in a case wherein there was some minutes before
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossi-
ble to express to the life what the ecstacies and
transports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I
may say, out of the very grave; and I do not won-
der now at that custom, viz. that when a malefac-
tor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied up,
and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve
brought to him : I say, I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very
moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may
not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and
overwhelm him :
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in
the contemplation of my deliverance, making a
thousand gestures and motions which I cannot
describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that
were drowned, and that there should not be one
soul saved but myself; for, as for them, I never
saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfort.
able part of my condition, I began to look round
me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what
was next to be done; and I soon found my com-
forts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful
deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift
me, nor any thing either to eat or drink to com-
fort me; neither did I see any prospect before
me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being
devoured by wild beasts: and that which was par-
ticularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no wea-
pon either to hunt and kill any creature for my
sustenance, or to defend myself against any other
creature that might desire to kill me for theirs: in
a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a to-
bacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was
all my provision, and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like
a mad-man; night coming upon me, I began with a
heavy heart to consider what would be mylot if there
were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing
at night they always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw
no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong from
the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to
drink, which I did, to my great joy; and having
drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to
prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting
up into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as that
if I should sleep I might not fall; and having cut
me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence,
I took up my lodging, and having been excessively
fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my condition,
and found myself the most refreshed with it that I
think I ever was on such an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather
clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did not
rage and swell as before: but that which surprised
me most, was, that the ship was lifted off in the
night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling
of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the
rock which I first mentioned, where I had been so
bruised by the dashing me against it; this being
within about a mile from the shore where I was, and
the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished
myself on board, that, at least, I might save some
necessary things for my use.
When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I looked about me again, and the first thing
I found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the
sea had tossed her, up upon the land, about two
miles on my right hand: I walked as far as I could
upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck
or inlet of water between me and the boat, which
was about half a mile broad; so I came back for the
present, being more intent upon getting at the ship,
where I hoped to find something for my present
subsistence.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm,
and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come
within a quarter of a mile of the ship; and here J
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw
evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had
been all safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left
entirely destitute of all comfort and company, as
I now was: this forced tears from my eyes again,
but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possible, to get to the ship; so I pulled off my
clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and
took the water; but when I came to the ship, my
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on
board, for as she lay a-ground, and high out of the
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay
hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second
time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I won-
dered I did not see at first, hang down by the fore-
chains so low as that with great difficulty I got
hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into
WOL. I. F
the forecastle of the ship: here I found that the
ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in
her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank
of hard sand, or rather earth, and her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost
to the water; by this means all her quarter was
free, and all that was in that part was dry; for
you may be sure my first work was to search and
to see what was spoiled and what was free: and
first I found that all the ship's provisions were
dry, and untouched by the water; and being very
well disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and
filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went
about other things, for I had no time to lose. I
also found some rum in the great cabin, of which
I took a large dram, and which I had indeed need
enough of to spirit me for what was before me.
Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish my-
self with many things which I foresaw would be
very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had, and this extremity roused my ap-
plication. We had several spare yards, and two
or three large spars of wood, and a spare top-mast
or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many of them overboard as I
could manage of their weight, tying every one
with a rope that they might not drive away; when
this was done I went down the ship's side, and
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast toge-
ther at both ends, as well as I could, in the form of
a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank
upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk upon
it very well, but that it was not able to bear any
great weight, the pieces being too light; so I went
to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare
top-mast into three lengths, and added them to my
raft, with a great deal of labour and pains: but hope
of furnishing myself with necessaries, encouraged
me to go beyond what I should have been able to
have done upon another occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any
reasonable weight; my next care was what to load
it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it
from the surf of the sea; but I was not long con-
sidering this ; I first laid all the planks or boards
upon it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, I first got three of the
seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft;
the first of these I filled with provisions, viz. bread,
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's
flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little re-
mainder of European corn which had been laid by
for some fowls which we brought to sea with us,
but the fowls were killed; there had been some
barley and wheat together, but, to my great disap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all; as for liquors, I found several
cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which
were some cordial waters, and in all above five or
six gallons of rack; these Istowed by themselves,
F 2
there being no need to put them into the chest,
nor no room for them. While I was doing this, I
found the tide began to flow, though very calm;
and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt,
and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the
sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which were
only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on board in
them and my stockings: however, this put me upon
rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough,
but took no more than I wanted for present use,
for I had other things which my eye was more
upon; as, first, tools to work with on shore; and
it was after long searching that I found out the
carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful
prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-
loading of gold would have been at that time: I
got it down to my raft, even whole as it was, with-
out losing time to look into it, for I knew in general
what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and
arms: there were two very good fowling-pieces in
the great cabin, and two pistols; these I secured
first, with some powder-horns, and a small bag of
shot, and two old rusty swords: I knew there were
three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gunner had stowed them ; but with
much search I found them, two of them dry and
good, the third had taken water: those two I got
to my raft, with the arms; and now I thought
myself pretty well freighted, and began to think
how I should get to shore with them, having nei-
ther sail, oar, or rudder, and the least cap-full of
wind would have overset all my navigation.
I had three encouragements: 1. A smooth, calm
sea: 2. The tide rising and setting into the shore:
8. What little wind there was, blew me towards
the land: and thus, having found two or three
broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the
tools which were in the chest, I found two saws,
an ax and a hammer, and with this cargo I put
to sea. For a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went
very well, only that I found it drive a little distant
from the place where I had landed before, by
which I perceived that there was some indraft of
the water, and consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might make use of
as a port to get to land with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was; there appeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I found a
strong current of the tide set into it, so I guided
my raft as well as I could to keep in the middle
of the stream : but here I had like to have suffered
a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily
would have broke my heart; for knowing nothing
of the coast, my raft run a-ground at one end of
it upon a shoal, and not being a-ground at the
other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo
had slipped off towards that end that was afloat,
and so fallen into the water. I did my utmost, by
setting my back against the chests, to keep them
in their places, but could not thrust off the raft
with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the
F S
posture I was in ; but holding up the chests with
all my might, stood in that manner near half an
hour, in which time the rising of the water brought
me a little more upon a level; and a little after,
the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I
thrust her off with the oar I had, into the channel ;
and then driving up higher, I at length found my-
self in the mouth of a little river, with land on
both sides, and a strong current or tide running
up : I looked on both sides for a proper place to
get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high up the river, hoping in time to see some
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself
as near the coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the right shore
of the creek, to which, with great pain and diffi-
culty, I guided my raft, and at last got so near, as
that, reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust
her directly in ; but here I had like to have dipped
all my cargo in the sea again; for that shore lying
pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there was no
place to land, but where one end of the float, if it
run on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo
again : all that I could do, was to wait till the tide
was at the highest, keeping the raft with my oar
like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the
shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected
the water would flow over; and so it did. As
soon as I found water enough (for my raft drew
about a foot of water), I thrust her on upon that
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored
her by sticking my two broken oars into the
ground; one on one side near one end; and one on
the other side near the other end; and thus I lay
till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all
my cargo safe on shore.
My next work was to view the country, and
seek a proper place for my habitation, and where
to stow my goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen; where I was I yet knew not;
whether on the continent or on an island, whe-
ther inhabited or not inhabited, whether in dan-
ger of wild beasts or not: there was a hill not
above a mile from me, which rose up very steep
and high, and which seemed to over-top some
other hills which lay as in a ridge from it north-
ward; I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and
one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top
of that hill, where, after I had with great labour
and difficulty got to the top, I saw my fate to
my great affliction, viz. that I was in an island
environed every way with the sea, no land to be
seen, except some rocks which lay a great way
off, and two small islands less than this, which
lay about three leagues to the west.
• I found also that the island I was in was bar-
ren, and, as I saw good reason to believe, unin-
habited, except by wild beasts, of whom however
I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them,
F 4
could I tell what was fit for food, and what not.
At my coming back, I shot at a great bird, which
I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great
wood; I believe it was the first gun that had been
fired there since the creation of the world. I had
no sooner fired, but from all the parts of the wood
there arose an innumerable number of fowls of
many sorts, making a confused screaming, and
crying every one according to his usual note; but
not one of them of any kind that I knew: as for
the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but had
no talons or claws more than common; its flesh
was carrion, and fit for nothing. -
Contented with this discovery, I came back to
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on
shore, which took me up the rest of that day;
and what to do with myself at night I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie
down on the ground, not knowing but some wild
beast might devour me, though, as I afterwards
found, there was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed my-
self round with the chests and boards that I had
brought on shore, and made a kind of a hut for
that night's lodging: as for food, I yet saw not
which way to supply myself, except that I had
seen two or three creatures, like hares, run out of
the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would
be useful to me, and particularly some of the rig-
ging and sails, and such other things as might
come to land, and I resolved to make another
voyage on board the vessel, if possible; and as I
knew that the first storm that blew must necessa-
rily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all
other things apart, till I got every thing out of
the ship that I could get: then I called a council,
that is to say, in my thoughts, whether I should
take back the raft; but this appeared imprac-
ticable; so I resolved to go as before, when the
tide was down, and I did so, only that I stripped
before I went from my hut, having nothing on
but a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen trowsers,
and a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared
a second raft; and having had experience of the
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded
it so hard; but yet I brought away several things
very useful to me; as first, in the carpenter’s
stores, I found two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of
hatchets, and above all, that most useful thing
called a grindstone: all these I secured, together
with several things belonging to the gunner, par-
ticularly two or three iron crows, and two barrels
of musquet-bullets, seven musquets, and another
fowling-piece, with some small quantity of pow-
der more ; a large bag full of small shot, and a
great roll of sheet lead; but this last was so heavy
I could not hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's
clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-top-sail,
hammock, and some bedding; and with this I
loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe
on shore, to my very great comfort. -
I was under some apprehensions during my ab-
sence from the land, that at least my provisions
might be devoured on shore; but when I came
back, I found no sign of any visitor, only there
sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the
chests, which, when I came towards it, ran away
a little distance, and then stood still: she sat very
composed, and unconcerned, and looked full in my
face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with
me; I presented my gun at her, but as she did
not understand it, she was perfectly unconcerned
at it, nor did she offer to stir away : upon which
I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way
I was not very free of it, for my store was not
great: however, I spared her a bit, I say, and she
went to it, smelled at it, ate it, and looked, as
pleased, for more: but I thanked her, and could
spare no more; so she marched off.
Having got my second cargo on shore, though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, (for they were too heavy, being
large casks,) I went to work to make me a little
tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for
that purpose; and into this tent I brought every
thing that I knew would spoil, either with rain
or sun, and I piled all the empty chests and casks
up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.
When I had done this I blocked up the door of
the tent with some boards within, and an empty
chest set up an-end without: and spreading one
of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pis-
tols just at my head, and my gun at length by me,
I went to bed for the first time, and slept very
quietly all night, for I was very weary and heavy;
for the night before I had slept little, and had
laboured very hard all day, as well to fetch all
those things from the ship, as to get them on
shore. -
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now,
that ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but
I was not satisfied still ; for while the ship sat up-
right in that posture, I thought I ought to get
every thing out of her that I could: so every day
at low water I went on board, and brought away
something or other; but particularly the third
time I went, I brought away as much of the rig-
ging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope
twine I could get, with a piece of spare canvass,
which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and
the barrel of wet gun-powder: in a word, I brought
away all the sails first and last, only that I was
fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a
time as I could ; for they were no more useful to
be sails, but as mere canvass only.
But that which comforted me more still, was,
that, last of all, after I had made five or six such
voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more
to expect from the ship that was worth my med-
dling with ; I say, after all this, I found a great
hogshead of bread, and three large runlets of rum
or spirits, and a box of sugar and a barrel of fine
flour: this was surprising to me, because I had
given over expecting any more provisions, except
what was spoiled by the water: I soon emptied
the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up,
parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut
out: and, in a word, I got all this safe on shore
also.
The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the ship of what was portable
and fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and
cutting the great cable into pieces, such as I could
move, I got two cables and a hawser on shore,
with all the iron-work I could get; and having
cut down the spritsail-yard, and the mizen-yard,
and every thing I could to make a large raft, I
loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came
away: but my good luck began now to leave me;
for this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen,
that after I had entered the little cove, where I
had landed the rest of my goods, not being able
to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset,
and threw me and all my cargo into the water.
As for myself it was no great harm, for I was near
the shore; but as to my cargo, it was great part of
it lost, especially the iron, which I expected
would have been of great use to me: however,

when the tide was out, I got most of the pieces
of cable ashore; and some of the iron, though
with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it
into the water, a work which fatigued me very
much. After this, I went every day on board,
and brought away what I could get... . . -
I had been now 13 days on shore, and had been
11 times on board the ship, in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of hands could well
be supposed capable to bring ; though I believe
verily, had the calm weather held, I should have
brought away the whole ship, piece by piece; but
preparing the 12th time to go on board, I found
the wind began to rise; however at low water I
went on board, and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so effectually, as that nothing
more could be found, yet I discovered a locker
with drawers in it, in one of which I found two
or three razors, and one pair of large scissars, with
some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in
another I found about thirty-six pounds value in
money, some European coin, some Brasil, some
pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of this money,
O Drug said I, aloud, what art thou good for?
thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the ground: one of those knives is worth all
this heap: I have no manner of use for thee, even
remain where thou art and go to the bottom, as a
creature whose life is not worth saving. How-
ever, upon second thoughts, I took it away, and
wrapping all this in a piece of canvass, I began to
think of making another raft; but while I was
preparing this, I found the sky over-cast, and the
wind began to rise, and in a quarter of an hour it
blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently oc-
curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it
was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the
shore at all: accordingly I let myself down into
the water, and swam cross the channel, which lay
between the ship and the sands, and even that
with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of
things I had about me, and partly the roughness
of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and
before it was quite high water it blew a storm.
But I was gotten home to my little tent, where
Ilay with all my wealth about me very secure. It
blew very hard all that night; and in the morning
when I looked out, behold no more ship was to be
seen: I was a little surprised, but recovered my-
self with this satisfactory reflection, viz. That I
had lost no time, nor abated any diligence to get
every thing out of her that could be useful to me;
and that indeed there was little left in her that I
was able to bring away, if I had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship,
or of any thing out of her, except what might
drive on shore from her wreck, as indeed divers
pieces of her afterwards did; but those things
were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself against either savages (if any
should appear) or wild beasts, if any were in the
island; and I had many thoughts of the method
how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make ;
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or
a tent upon the earth : and, in short, I resolved
upon both, of the manner and description of
which it may not be improper to give an ac-
Count. -
I soon found the place I was in was not for my
settlement, particularly because it was upon a low
moorish ground near the sea, and I believed would
not be wholesome, and more particularly because
there was no fresh water near it; so I resolved to
find a more healthy and more convenient spot of
ground.
I consulted several things in my situation which
I found would be proper for me : 1st, Health, and
fresh water, I just now mentioned. 2dly, Shelter
from the heat of the sun. 3dly, Security from
ravenous creatures, whether man or beast. 4thly,
A view to the sea; that if God sent any ship in
sight, I might not lose any advantage for my de-
liverance, of which I was not willing to banish all
my expectation yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front
towards this little plain was steep as a house-side,
so that nothing could come down upon me from
the top; on the side of this rock there was a hol-
low place, worn a little way in, like the entrance
or door of a cave; but there was not really any cave
or way into the rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was
not above an hundred yards broad, and about
twice as long, and lay like a green before my
door, and at the end of it descended irregularly
every way down into the low grounds by the sea-
side. It was on the N. N. W. side of the hill, so
that I was sheltered from the heat every day, till
it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
which in those countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle
before the hollow place, which took in about ten
yards in its semi-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending.
In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground about five foot and a half, and sharp-
ened on the top; the two rows did not stand above
six inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and laid them in rows one upon an-
other, within the circle between these two rows
of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two foot
and a half high, like a spur to a post; and this
fence was so strong, that neither man or beast
could get into it or over it: this cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles
in the woods, bring them to the place, and drive
them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by
a door, but by a short ladder, to go over the top;
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me;
and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified, as
I thought, from all the world, and consequently
slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could
not have done; though, as it appeared afterward,
there was no need of all this caution from the ene-
mies that I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour,
I carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammu-
nition and stores, of which you have the account
above; and I made me a large tent, which, to pre-
serve me from the rains, that in one part of the year
are very violent there, I made double, viz. one
smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it,
and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin
which I had saved among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed
which I had brought on shore, but in a hammock,
which was indeed a very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and
everything that would spoil by the wet; and having
thus enclosed all my goods, I made up the entrance,
which till now I had left open, and so passed and
repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.
VOL. I. G
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock; and bringing all the earth and
stones that I dug down, out through my tent, I
laid them up within my fence in the nature of a
terrace, that so it raised the ground within about
a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave just
behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to
my house.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before
all these things were brought to perfection, and
therefore I must go back to some other things
which took up some of my thoughts. At the
same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme
for the setting up my tent, and making the cave,
that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark cloud,
a sudden flash of lightning happened, and after
that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the
effect of it: I was not so much surprised with the
lightning, as I was with a thought which darted
into my mind as swift as the lightning itself: O
my powder! my very heart sunk within me, when I
thought, that at one blast all my powder might be
destroyed; on which, not my defence only, but the
providing me food, as I thought, entirely depended:
I was nothing near so anxious about my own dan-
ger; though had the powder took fire, I had never
known who had hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that
after the storm was over, I laid aside all my works,
my building, and fortifying, and applied myself
to make bags and boxes to separate the powder,
and to keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in
hope, that whatever might come, it might not all
take fire at once; and to keep it so apart, that it
should not be possible to make one part fire an-
other. I finished this work in about a fortnight;
and I think, my powder, which in all was about
240 pounds weight, was divided in not less than a
hundred parcels: as to the barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that, so
I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I
called my kitchen; and the rest I hid up and
down in holes among the rocks, so that no wet
might come to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I -
went out once at least every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any
thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to ac-
quaint myself with what the island produced. The
first time I went out I presently discovered that
there were goats in the island, which was a great
satisfaction to me; but then it was attended with
this misfortune to me, viz. that they were so shy,
so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the most
difficult thing in the world to come at them; but
I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but I
might now and then shoot one, as it soon hap-
pened; for after I had found their haunts a little,
I laid wait in this manner for them: I observed, if
they saw me in the valleys, though they were upon
the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
G 2
fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys,
and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of
me: from whence I concluded, that by the posi-
tion of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily see objects
that were above them : so afterward I took this
method: I always climbed the rocks first, to get
above them, and then had frequently a fair mark.
The first shot I made among these creatures, I
killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily;
but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still
by her till I came and took her up; and not only
so, but when I carried the old one with me upon my
shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my enclo-
sure, upon which I laid down the dam, and took the
kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in
hopes to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat,
so I was forced to kill it and eat it myself: these
two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I eat
sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread
especially) as much as possibly I could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it ab-
solutely necessary to provide a place to make a fire
in, and fuel to burn; and what I did for that, as
also how I enlarged my cave, and what conveni-
ences I made, I shall give a full account of in its
place: but I must first give some little account of
myself, and of my thoughts about living, which it
may well be supposed were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not cast away upon that island without being
driven, as is said, by a violent storm quite out of
the course of our intended voyage, and a great
way, viz. Some hundreds of leagues out of the
ordinary course of the trade of mankind, I had
great reason to consider it as a determination of
Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this de-
solate manner, I should end my life. The tears
would run plentifully down my face when I made
these reflections, and sometimes I would expostu-
late with myself, why Providence should thus com-
pletely ruin his creatures, and render them so abso-
lutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so
entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational
to be thankful for such a life.
But something always returned swift upon me
to check these thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly one day, walking with my gun in my
hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive upon the
subject of my present condition, when reason as it
were expostulating with me the other way, thus:
Well, you are in a desolate condition, it is true;
but pray remember, where are the rest of you ?
Did not you eome eleven of you into the boat?
Where are the ten ? Why were they not saved and
you lost? Why were you singled out? Is it better
to be here or there? and then I pointed to the
sea. All evils are to be considered with the good
that is in them, and with what worse attended
them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
G 3
furnished for my subsistence, and what would have
been my case if it had not happened, which was
an hundred thousand to one, that the ship floated
from the place where she first struck, and was
driven so near the shore that I had time to get all
these things out of her : what would have been my
case if I had been to have lived in the condition in
which I at first came on shore, without necessaries
of life or necessaries to supply and procure them 2
Particularly, said I aloud, (though to myself) what
should I have done without a gun, without ammu-
nition, without any tools to make any thing, or to
work with ; without clothes, bedding, a tent, or
any manner of covering: and that now I had all
these to a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way
to provide myselfin such a manner, as to live with-
out my gun when my ammunition was spent; so
that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without .
any want, as long as I lived; for I considered from
the beginning how I should provide for the acci-
dents that might happen and for the time that was
to come, even not only after my ammunition should
be spent, but even after my health or strength
should decay.
I confess I had not entertained any notion of
my ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I
mean my powder being blown up by lightning;
and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to
me when it lightened and thundered, as I observed
just now.
And now being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a scene of silent life, such perhaps as
was never heard of in the world before, I shall take
it from its beginning, and continue it in its order.
It was, by my account, the 30th of September,
when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot
upon this horrid island, when the sun being, to us,
in its autumnal equinox, was almost just over my
head; for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be
in the latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north of
the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days,
it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from
the working days; but to prevent this, I cut it
with my knife upon a large post in capital letters,
and making it into a great cross, I set it up on the
shore where I first landed, viz. I came on shore
here on the 30th of Sept. 1659. Upon the sides
of this square post, I cut every day a notch with
my knife, and every seventh notch was as long
again as the rest, and every first day of the month
as long again as that long one; and thus I kept my
calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning
of time. -
In the next place we are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought out of the ship
in the several voyages, which, as above mentioned,
I made to it, I got several things of less value,
but not all less useful to me, which I omitted set-
ting down before ; as in particular, pens, ink, and
G 4
paper; several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gun-
ner's, and carpenter's keeping; three or four com-
passes, some mathematical instruments, dials, per-
spectives, charts, and books of navigation; all
which I huddled together, whether I might want
them or no: also, I found three very good bibles
which came to me in my cargo from England, and
which I had packed up among my things; some
Portuguese books also, and among them two or
three popish prayer-books, and several other books,
all which I carefully secured. And I must not
forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats
of whose eminent history I may have occasion to
say something in its place; for I carried both the
cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out
of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me
the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and was a trusty servant to me many years; I
wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any
company that he could make up to me; I only
wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could
not do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink,
and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost;
and I shall shew, that while my ink lasted, I kept
things very exact; but after that was gone, I could
not; for I could not make any ink, by any means
that I could devise.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithstanding all that I had amassed to-
gether; and of these this of ink was one, as also
spade, pick-axe and shovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I
soon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale or surrounded habi-
tation: the piles or stakes, which were as heavy
as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting
and preparing in the woods, and more by far in
bringing home; so that I spent sometimes two days
in cutting and bringing home one of those posts,
and a third day in driving it into the ground; for
which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first,
but at last bethought myself of one of the iron
crows, which however, though I found it, yet it
made driving those posts or piles very laborious and
tedious work. -
But what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of any thing I had to do, seeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other em-
ployment if that had been over, at least, that I could
foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for
food, which I did more or less every day.
I now began to consider seriously my condition,
and the circumstance I was reduced to, and I
drew up the state of my affairs in writing; not so
much to leave them to any that were to come
after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as
to deliver my thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and afflicting my mind; and as my reason
began now to master my despondency, I began to
comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
good against the evil, that I might have some-
thing to distinguish my case from worse; and
I stated it very impartially, like debtor and credi-
tor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I
suffered, thus:
EVIL.
I am cast upon a horri-
ble desolate island, void of
all hope of recovery.
I am singled out and se-
parated, as it were, from
all the world, to be mi-
serable.

kind, a solitaire, one ba-
nished from human so-
ciety.

But I am alive, and
not drowned, as all my
ship's company was.
But I am singled out
too from all the ship’s
crew to be spared from
death; and He that mira-
culously saved me from
death, can deliver me from
this condition.
But I am not starved

place, affording no suste-

I have no soul to peak But God wonderfully
to, or relieve me. sent the ship in near
enough to the shore, that
I have gotten out so many
necessary things as will
either supply my wants,
or enable me to supply
myself even as long as I
live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testi-
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the
world so miserable, but there was something nega-
tive or something positive to be thankful for in it;
and let this stand as a direction from the expe-
rience of the most miserable of all conditions in
this world, that we may always find in it something
to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the de-
scription of good and evil, on the credit side of the
aCCOunt. -
Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, and given over looking out to sea, to
see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these
things, I began to apply myself to accommodate
my way of living, and to make things as easy to me
as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded
with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I might
now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall
up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the
outside, and after some time, I think it was a year
and a half, I raised rafters from it, leaning to the
rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of
trees, and such things as I could get to keep out
the rain, which I found at some times of the year
very violent.
I have already observed how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I had
made behind me: but I must observe too that at
first this was a confused heap of goods, which as
they lay in no order, so they took up all my place, I
had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to en-
large my cave and works farther into the earth;
for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily
to the labour I bestowed on it: and so when I found
I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked
sideways to the right hand into the rock; and then,
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
made me a door to come out, on the outside of my
pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it
were a back-way to my tent and to my store-house,
but gave me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, parti-
cularly a chair and a table; for without these I was
l
- - -
- - -
- - -

not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the
world; I could not write or eat, or do several things
with so much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work ; and here I must needs ob-
serve, that as reason is the substance and original
of the mathematics, so by stating and squaring
everything by reason, and by making the most
rational judgment of things, every man may be in
time master of every mechanic art. I had never
handled a tool in my life, and yet in time by labour,
application, and contrivance, I found at last that I
wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially
if I had had tools; however I made abundance of
things, even without tools, and some with no more
tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps
were never made that way before, and that with
infinite labour; for example, if I wanted a board,
I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it
on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side
with my axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as
a plank, and then dub it smooth with my adze. It
is true, by this method I could make but one board
out of a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for
but patience, any more than I had for the prodi-
gious deal of time and labour which it took me up
to make a plank or board: but my time or labour
was little worth, and so it was as well employed one
way as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I
observed above, in the first place, and this I did
out of the short pieces of boards which I brought
on my raft from the ship: but when I had wrought
out some boards, as above, I made large shelves,
of the breadth of a foot and a half one over another,
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron-work, and in a word, to separate
every thing at large in their places, that I might
come easily at them; I knocked pieces into the
wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things
that would hang up.
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things;
and I had every thing so ready at my hand, that it
was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in
such order, and especially to find my stock of all ne-
cessaries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep a journal
of every day's employment; for indeed at first I
was in too much a hurry; and not only hurry as
to labour, but in too much discomposure of mind,
and my journal would have been full of many dull
things. For example, I must have said thus:
Sept. the 30th, after I got to shore, and had
escaped drowning, instead of being thankful to
God for my deliverance, having first vomited with
the great quantity of salt water which was gotten
into my stomach, and recovering myself a little, I
ran about the shore, wringing my hands, and beat-
ing my head and face, exclaiming at my misery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone; till, tired
and faint, I was forced to lie down on the ground
to repose, but durst not sleep for fear of being de-
voured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on
board the ship, and got all that I could out of her,
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a
little mountain, and looking out to sea in hopes
of seeing a ship; then fancy at a vast distance I
spied a sail; please myself with the hopes of it;
and then, after looking steadily till I was almost
blind, lose it quite, and sit down and weep like a
child, and thus increase my misery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things in some
measure, and having settled my household-stuff and
habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all as
handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my
journal, of which I shall here give you the copy
(though in it will be told all these particulars over
again) as long as it lasted; for having no more ink,
I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
SEPT. 30, 1659. *
I Poor miserable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in the offing,
came on shore on this dismal unfortunate island,
which I called the Island of Despair, all the rest
of the ship's company being drowned, and myself
almost dead. -
All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting my-
self, at the dismal circumstances I was brought to,
viz. I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon, or
place to fly to, and in despair of any relief, saw
nothing but death before me, either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages,
or starved to death for want of food. At the ap-
proach of night I slept in a tree, for fear of wild
creatures, but slept soundly though it rained all
night.
October 1. In the morning I saw to my great
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide,
and was driven on shore again much nearer the
island, which as it was some comfort on one hand,
for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces,
I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board,
and get some food or necessaries out of her for my
relief; so, on the other hand, it renewed my grief
at the loss of my comrades, who I imagined if we
had all staid on board might have saved the ship, or
at least that they would not have been all drowned,
as they were ; and that, had the men been saved,
we might perhaps have built us a boat out of the
ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other
part of the world. I spent great part of this day
in perplexing myself on these things; but at
length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went upon the
sand as near as I could, and then swam on board;
this day also it continued raining, though with no
wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in making several voyages to
get all I could out of the ship, which I brought
on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I
had got up upon it: but being in shoal water, and
the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of
them when the tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of wind, during which time the ship
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen, except
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent
this day in covering and securing the goods which
I had saved, that rain might not spoil them.
Oct. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day,
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly con-
cerned to secure myself from any attack in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semi-circle for my encampment,
which I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall,
or fortification made of double piles, lined within
with cable, and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in
carrying all my goods to my new habitation, though
some part of the time it rained exceeding hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went out into the
island with my gun, to see for some food, and dis-
cover the country; when I killed a she-goat, and
her kid followed me home; which I afterwards
killed also, because it would not feed. -
VOL. I. H
November 1. I set up my tent under a rock,
and lay there for the first night, making it as large
as I could with stakes driven in to swing my ham-
mock upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with
them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two
fowls like ducks, which were very good food. In
the afternoon went to work to make me a table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my
times of work, of going out with my gun, time of
sleep, and time of diversion; viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun for two or three hours, if
it did not rain, then employed myself to work till
about eleven o’clock, then eat what I had to live on,
and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, the
weather being excessive hot, and then in the even-
ing to work again: the working part of this day, and
of the next, were wholly employed in making my
table, for I was yet but a very sorry workman,
though time and necessity made me a complete na-
tural mechanic soon after, as I believe it would do
any one else.
Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft,
but her flesh good for nothing: every creature I
killed I took off the skins and preserved them.
Coming back by the sea-shore I saw many sorts of
sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was
surprised and almost frighted with two or three
seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well know-
ing what they were, got into the sea, and escaped
me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to
my liking: nor was it long before I learned to
mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and part of the 12th (for
the 11th was Sunday) I took wholly up to make me
a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tolerable
shape, but never to please me; and even in the
making I pulled it in pieces several times. Note,
I soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for omitting
my mark for them on my post, I forgot which was
which.
Nov. 18. This day it rained, which refreshed
me exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was
accompanied with terrible thunder and lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my pow-
der: as soon as it was over I resolved to separate
my stock of powder into as many little parcels as
possible, that it might not be in danger. -
Nov. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in
making little square chests or boxes, which might
hold about a pound, or two pounds, at most, of
powder; and so putting the powder in, I stowed it
in places as secure and remote from one another as
possible. On one of these three days I killed a
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.
H 2
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my
tent into the rock, to make room for my farther
conveniency. Note, three things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a shovel,
and a wheel-barrow or basket, so I desisted from
my work, and began to consider how to supply
that want, and make me some tools: as for a
pick-axe, I made use of the iron crows, which
were proper enough, though heavy; but the next
thing was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely
necessary, that indeed I could do nothing effec-
tually without it; but what kind of one to make I
knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day in searching the woods
I found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in
the Brasils they call the Iron Tree, for its exceeding
hardness; of this, with great labour and almost spoil-
ing my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home
too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy.
The excessive hardness of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this ma-
chine; for I worked it effectually by little and little
into the form of a shovel or spade, the handle ex-
actly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom,
it would not last me so long; however it served
well enough for the uses which I had occasion to
put it to; but never was a shovel, I believe, made
after that fashion, or so long a making.
:: I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a
wheel-barrow : a basket I could not make by any
means, having no such things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet found
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of,
neither did I know how to go about it; besides, I
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for
the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so I gave
it over; and so for carrying away the earth which I
dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they
serve the bricklayers. -
This was not so difficult to me as the making the
shovel; and yet this, and the shovel, and the at-
tempt which I made in vain to make a wheel-barrow,
took me up no less than four days, I mean always
excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I
seldom failed; and very seldom failed also bringing
home something to eat. • *
Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still,
because of my making these tools, when they were
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I spent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodiously.
Note, During all this time, I worked to make
this room or cave spacious enough to accommodate
me as a warehouse or magazine, a kitchen, a diming-
room, and a cellar; as for my lodging, I kept to
the tent, except that sometimes in the wet season
of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep
H 3
myself dry, which caused me afterwards to cover
all my place within my pale with long poles in the
form of rafters, leaning against the rock, and load
them with flags and large leaves of trees like a
thatch. -
December 10. I began now to think my cave
or vault finished, when on a sudden (it seems I had
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell
down from the top and one side, so much that in
short it frighted me, and not without reason too;
for if I had been under it I had never wanted a
grave-digger: upon this disaster I had a great deal
of work to do over again; for I had the loose earth
to carry out, and, which was of more importance,
I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be
sure no more would come down.
Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it ac-
cordingly, and got two shores or posts pitched up-
right to the top, with two pieces of boards across
over each post; this I finished the next day; and
setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, stand-
ing in rows, served me for partitions to part off
my house.
Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I
placed shelves, and knocked up nails on the posts
to hang every thing up that could be hung up ;
and now I began to be in some order within doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the
cave, and began to furnish my house, and set up
some pieces of boards, like a dresser. to order my
victuals upon; but boards began to be very scarce
with me: also I made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no
stirring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all day.
Dec. 26. No rain? and the earth much cooler
than before, and pleasanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed an-
other, so that I caught it, and led it home in a
string; when I had it home, I bound and splin-
tered up its leg, which was broke. N. B. I took
such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well
and as strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it
grew tame, and fed upon the little green at my
door, and would not go away : this was the first
time that I entertained a thought of breeding up
some tame creatures, that I might have food when
my powder and shot was all spent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze;
so that there was no stirring abroad, except in the
evening for food: this time I spent in putting all
my things in order within doors.
January 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad
early and late with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening, going farther
into the valleys, which lay towards the centre of
the island, I found there was plenty of goats,
though exceeding shy and hard to come at; how-
ever I resolved to try if I could not bring my dog
to hunt them down. -
Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out
H 4
with my dog, and set him upon the goats; but I
was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the
dog; and he knew his danger too well, for he
would not come near them.
Jan. 8. I began my fence or wall; which, being
still jealous of my being attacked by somebody, I
resolved to make very thick and strong.
N. B. This wall being described before, I
purposely omit what was said in the Jour-
nal ; it is sufficient to observe, that I was
no less time than from the 3d of January
to the 14th of April, working, finishing,
and perfecting this wall, though it was
no more than about 24 yards in length,
being a half circle from one place in the
rock to another place about eight yards
from it, the door of the cave being in
the centre behind it.
All this time I worked very hard, the rains hin-
dering me many days, nay, sometimes weeks toge-
ther; but I thought I should never be perfectly
secure until this wall was finished; and it is scarce
credible what inexpressible labour every thing was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground, for I
made them much bigger than I need to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside
double fenced with a turf-wall raised up close to
it, I persuaded myself that if any people were to
come on shore there, they would not perceive any
thing like a habitation; and it was very well I did
so, as may be observed hereafter upon a very re-
markable occasion.
During this time I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me,
and made frequent discoveries in these walks of
something or other to my advantage; particularly
I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
in the holes of the rocks; and taking some young
ones, I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and
did so; but when they grew older they flew away.
which perhaps was at first for want of feeding
them, for I had nothing to give them; however I
frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat. -
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
I found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first it was impossible for me to make,
as indeed, as to some of them, it was; for instance,
I could never make a cask to be hooped: I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I
could never arrive to the capacity of making one
by them, though I spent many weeks about it; I
could neither put in the heads, or joint the staves
so true to one another as to make them hold water;
so I gave that also over. -
In the next place, I was at a great loss for
candle; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which
was generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to
-
go to bed: I remembered the lump of bees-wax
with which I made candles in my African adven-
ture, but I had none of that now; the only remedy
I had, was, that when I had killed a goat I saved
the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay,
which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick
of some oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave
me light, though not a clear steady light like a
candle. In the middle of all my labours it hap-
pened, that rummaging my things, I found a little
bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled with
corn for the feeding of poultry—not for this voy-
age, but before, as I suppose, when the ship came
from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had
been in the bag, was all devoured with the rats,
and I saw nothing in the bag but husks and dust;
and being willing to have the bag for some other
use, I think it was to put powder in, when I di-
vided it for fear of the lightning, or some such
use, I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side
of my fortification under the rock.
It was a little before the great rains, just now
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no
notice of any thing, and not so much as remem-
bering that I had thrown any thing there; when
about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some
few stalks of something green shooting out of the
ground, which I fancied might be some plant I
had not seen; but I was surprised and perfectly
astonished, when after a little longer time I saw
about ten or twelve ears come out, which were
perfect green barley of the same kind as our Euro-
pean, nay, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any sense of any thing
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance,
or, as we lightly say, what pleases GoD ; without
so much as inquiring into the end of Providence
in these things, or his order in governing events
in the world; but after I saw barley grow there,
in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially that I knew not how it came there,
it startled me strangely; and I began to suggest,
that God had miraculously caused this grain to
grow without any help of seed sown, and that it
was so directed purely for my sustenance on that
wild miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought
tears out of my eyes, and I began to bless myself,
that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon
my account; and this was the more strange to me,
because I saw near it still, all along by the side of
the rock, some other straggling stalks, which
proved to be stalks of rice, and which I knew, be-
cause I had seen it grow in Africa, when I was
ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure productions
of Providence for my support, but not doubting
but that there was more in the place, I went all
over that part of the island, where I had been be-
fore, peeping in every corner and under every rock
to see for more of it, but I could not find any; at
last it occurred to my thought, that I had shook
a bag of chickens meat out in that place, and then
the wonder began to cease; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to GoD's providence
began to abate too, upon discovering that all this
was nothing but what was common; though I
ought to have been as thankful for so strange and
unforeseen a providence as if it had been miracu-
lous; for it was really the work of Providence as
to me, that should order or appoint ten or twelve
grains of corn to remain unspoiled, when the rats
had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped
from heaven: as also, that I should throw it out
in that particular place, where, it being in the
shade of a high rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas if I had thrown it any where else at that
time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the ears of corn, you may be
sure, in their season, which was about the end of
June, and laying up every corn, I resolved to sow
them all again, hoping in time to have some quan-
tity sufficient to supply me with bread; but it was
not till the fourth year that I could allow myself
the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then
but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order;
for I lost all that I sowed the first season, by not
observing the proper time; for I sowed it just be-
fore the dry season, so that it never came up at all,
at least not as it would have done: of which in
its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind or
to the same purpose, viz. To make me bread, or
rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with-
out baking, though I did that also after some time.
But to return to my journal.
I worked excessive hard these three or four
months to get my wall done; and the 14th of
April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not
by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that there
might be no sign in the outide of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder, so I went up
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up
after me, and let it down on the inside : this was
a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room
enough, and nothing could come at me from with-
out, unless it could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished,
I had almost had all my labour overthrown at once,
and myself killed; the case was thus: As I was
busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in
the entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted
with a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for
on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling
down from the roof of my cave, and from the edge
of the hill, over my head, and two of the posts I
had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful man-
ner: I was heartily scared, but thought nothing
of what was really the cause, only thinking that
the top of my cave was falling in, as some of it had
done before; and for fear I should be buried in it,
I ran forward to my ladder; and not thinking my-
self safe there neither, I got over my wall for fear
of the pieces of the hill which I expected might
roll down upon me: I was no sooner stepped down
upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a
terrible earthquake, for the ground I stood on
shook three times at about eight minutes distance,
with three such shocks as would have overturned
the strongest building that could be supposed to
have stood on the earth; and a great piece of the
top of a rock, which stood about half a mile from
me next the sea, fell down with such a terrible
noise as I never heard in all my life: I perceived
also the very sea was put into violent motion by
it; and I believe the shocks were stronger under
the water than on the island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having
never felt the like, or discoursed with any one that
had, that I was like one dead or stupified; and
the motion of the earth made my stomach sick,
like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and
rousing me from the stupified condition I was in,
filled me with horror, and I thought of nothing
then but the hill falling upon my tent, and all my
household goods, and burying all at once; and this
sunk my very soul within me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no
more for some time, I began to take courage, and
yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall
again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat still
upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconso.
late, not knowing what to do: all this while I had
not the least serious religious thought, nothing
but the common, Lord have mercy upon me; and
when it was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; soon after that
the wind rose by little and little, so that in less
than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurri.
cane : the sea was all on a sudden covered over
with foam and froth, the shore was covered with
the breach of the water, the trees were torn up by
the roots, and a terrible storm it was ; and this
held about three hours, and then began to abate,
and in two hours more it was stark calm, and began
to rain very hard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a sudden it came
into my thoughts, that these winds and rain being
the consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itself was spent and over, and I might venture
into my cave again: with this thought my spirits
began to revive, and the rain also helping to per-
suade me, I went in and sat down in my tent, but
the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to
be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go
into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy,
for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz.
to cut a hole through my new fortification like a
sink to let water go out, which would else have
drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave
some time, and found still no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed;
and now, to support my spirits, which indeed
wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small sup of rum, which however I did
then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great
part of the next day, so that I could not stir
abroad; but my mind being more composed, I
began to think of what I had best do, concluding,
that if the island was subject to these earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a cave, but I
must consider of building me some little hut in an
open place, which I might surround with a wall
as I had done here, and so make myself secure
from wild beasts or men: but concluded, if I staid
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other,
be buried alive.
With these thoughts I resolved to remove my
tent from the place where it stood, which was just
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which,
if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall
upon my tent: and I spent the two next days,
being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving
where and how to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehen-
sion of lying abroad, without any fence, was almost
equal to it; but still, when I looked about and saw
how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly
concealed I was, and how safe from danger, it
made me very loth to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me that it
would require a vast deal of time for me to do this,
and that I must be contented to run the venture
where I was, till I had formed a camp for myself,
and had secured it to as to remove so it; so with
this resolution I composed myself for a time, and
resolved that I would go to work with all speed to
build me a wall with piles and cables, &c. in a
circle as before ; and set my tent up in it when it
was finished, but that I would venture to stay
where I was till it was finished and fit to remove to.
This was the 21st.
April 22. The next morning I began to consi-
der of means to put this resolve in execution, but
I was at a great loss about my tools; I had three
large axes and abundance of hatchets (for we
carried the hatchets for traffick with the Indians),
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
wood, they were all full of notches and dull, and
though I had a grind-stone, I could not turn it and
grind my tools too: this cost me as much thought
as a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand
VOL. I. I
point of politics, or a judge upon the life and death
of a man. At length I contrived a wheel with a
string, to turn it with my foot, that I might have
both my hands at liberty. Note, I had never seen
any such thing in England, or at least not to take
notice how it was done, though since I have ob-
served it is very common there; besides that, my
grind-stone was very large and heavy. This machine
cost me a full week’s work to bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up
in grinding my tools, my machine for turning my
grind-stone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, now I took a survey of it, and
reduced myself to one biscuit cake a day, which
made my heart very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the
sea-side, the tide being low, I saw something lie
on the shore bigger than ordinary; and it looked
like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small
barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of
the ship, which were driven on shore by the late
hurricane; and looking towards the wreck itself,
I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water
than it used to do: I examined the barrel which
was driven on shore, and soon found it was a
barrel of gunpowder, but it had taken water, and
the powder was caked as hard as a stone; however
I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and
went on upon the sands as near as I could to the
wreck of the ship, to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it
strangely removed : the fore-castle, which lay be-
fore buried in sand, was heaved up at least six
foot; and the stern, which was broke to pieces
and parted from the rest by the force of the sea,
soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed,
as it were, up, and cast on one side, and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that
whereas there was a great place of water before,
so that I could not come within a quarter of a
mile of the wreck without swimming, I could now
walk quite up to her when the tide was out. I was
surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it
must be done by the earthquake: and as by this
violence the ship was more broken open than for-
merly, so many things came daily on shore, which
the sea had loosened, and which the winds and
water rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the de-
sign of removing my habitation; and I busied my-
self mightily that day especially, in searching
whether I could make any way into the ship; but
I found nothing was to be expected of that kind,
for that all the inside of the ship was choked up
with sand; however, as I had learnt not to despair
of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing to
pieces that I could of the ship, concluding, that
every thing I could get from her would be of some
use or other to me. -
May 8. I began with my saw, and cut a piece
of a beam through, which I thought held some
I 2
of the upper part or quarter deck together; and
when I had cut it through, I cleared away the sand
as well as I could from the side which lay highest;
but the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over
for that time. -
May 4. I went a fishing, but caught not one
fish that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my
sport; when just going to leave off, I caught a
young dolphin. I had made me a long line of some
rope yarn, but I had no hooks, yet I frequently
caught fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all
which I dried in the sun, and eat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another
beam asunder, and brought three great fir planks
off from the decks, which I tied together, and
made swim on shore when the tide of flood came
OII, -
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got several iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work;
worked very hard, and came home very much
tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. -
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work, but found the weight of the
wreck had broke itself down, the beams being
cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie
loose: and the inside of the hold lay so open, that
I could see into it, but almost full of water and
sand. -
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now quite
clear of the water or sand; I wrenched open two
planks, and brought them on shore also with the
tide : I left the iron crow in the wreck for next
day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt se-
veral casks, and loosened them with the crow, but
could not break them up ; I felt also the roll of
English lead, and could stir it, but it was too
heavy to remove. -
May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber,
and boards, or plank, and two or three hundred
weight of iron. -
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I
could not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by placing
the edge of one hatchet, and driving it with the
other; but as it lay about a foot and a half in the
water, I could not make any blow to drive the
hatchet. : -
May 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of
the water; but I staid so long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going
to the wreck that day.
* May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown
on shore, at a great distance, near two miles off
me, but resolved to see what they were, and found
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to
bring away. -
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on
the wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some
I 3
things so much with the crow, that the first blow-
ing tide several casks floated out, and two of the
seamen’s chests; but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of
timber, and a hogshead, which had some Brazil pork
in it, but the salt water and the sand had spoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the 15th of
June, except the time necessary to get food, which
I always appointed, during this part of my employ-
ment, to be when the tide was up, that I might
be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time
I had gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work
enough to have built a good boat, if I had known
how ; and also, I got at several times, and in seve-
ral pieces, near 100 weight of the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea side, I found
a large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had
seen, which it seems was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or scarcity; for had I happened
to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day; as I found after-
wards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for them.
June 17. I spent in cooking the turtle; I found
in her threescore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the most savoury and pleasant that ever
I tasted in my life, having had no flesh, but of
goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid place.
June 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in
that latitude.
- -*
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea-
ther had been cold. -
June 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my
head, and feverish. - - -
June 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death
with the apprehensions of my sad condition, to be
sick and no help : Prayed to God for the first
time since the storm off Hull, but scarce knew what
I said, or why; my thoughts being all confused.
June 22. A little better, but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness. -
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering,
and then a violent head-ach. - - -
June 24. Much better.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after
it. -
June 26. Better; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; how-
ever I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty
got it home, and broiled some of it, and eat ; I
would fain have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay
a-bed all day, and neither eat or drank. I was
ready to perish for thirst, but so weak I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water
to drink: prayed to God again, but was light-
headed ; and when I was not, I was so ignorant
that I knew not what to say; only Ilay and cried,
Lord look upon me; Lord pity me; Lord have
I 4
mercy upon me: I suppose I did nothing else for
two or three hours, till the fit wearing off, I fell
asleep, and did not wake till far in the night; when
I waked I found myself much refreshed, but weak
and exceeding thirsty : however, as I had no water
in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till
morning, and went to sleep again. In this second
sleep I had this terrible dream.
. I thought that I was sitting on the ground on
the outside of my wall, where I sat when the
storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a
man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright
flame of fire, and alight upon the ground. He was
all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but
just bear to look towards him; his countenance
was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for
words to describe; when he stepped upon the
ground with his feet I thought the earth trembled
just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all
the air looked to my apprehension as if it had been
filled with flashes of fire.
He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand to kill me; and when he came
to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to
me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impos-
sible to express the terror of it; all that I can say I
understood was this, Seeing all these things have
not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt
die;’ at which words I thought he lifted up the
spear that was in his hand to kill me.
No one, that shall ever read this account, will
expect that I should be able to describe the horrors
of my soul at this terrible vision ; I mean, that
even while it was a dream, I even dreamed of
those horrors; nor is it any more possible to de-
scribe the impression that remained upon my mind,
when I awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had
received by the good instruction of my father was
then worn out by an uninterrupted series, for eight
years, of sea-faring wickedness, and a constant
conversation with nothing but such as were like
myself, wicked and profane to the last degree:
I do not remember that I had in all that time one
thought that so much as tended either to looking
upwards towards GoD, or inwards towards a reflec-
tion upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity
of soul, without desire of good, or conscious of
evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and I was
all that the most hardened, unthinking, wicked
creature among our common sailors can be sup-
posed to be, not having the least sense, either of
the fear of GoD in danger, or of thankfulness to
GoD in deliverances.
In the relating what is already past of my story,
this will be the more easily believed, when I shall
add, that through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never had so much
as one thought of it being the hand of GoD, or
that it was a just punishment for my sin, my re-
bellious behaviour against my father, or my present
sins, which were great; or so much as a punish-
ment for the general course of my wicked life.
When I was on the desperate expedition on the
desert shores of Africa, I never had so much as
one thought of what would become of me; or one
wish to God to direct me whither I should go, or
to keep me from the danger which apparently sur-
rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as
cruel savages: but I was merely thoughtless of a
GoD, or a Providence ; acted like a mere brute from
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of
common sense only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by
the Portugal captain, well used, and dealt justly
and honourably with, as well as charitably, I had
not the least thankfulness on my thoughts: when
again I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of
drowning on this island, I was as far from remorse,
or looking on it as a judgment; I only said to my-
self often, that I was an unfortunate dog, and born
to be always miserable. -
It is true, when I got on shore first here, and
found all my ship's crew drowned, and myself
spared, I was surprised with a kind of ectasy, and
some transports of soul, which, had the grace of
GoD assisted, might have come up to true thank-
fulness; but it ended where it begun, in a mere
common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad
I was alive, without the least reflection upon the
distinguishing goodness of the hand which had
preserved me, and had singled me out to be pre-
served, when all the rest were destroyed; or an
inquiry why providence had been thus merciful to
me; even just the same common sort of joy which
seamen generally have, after they have got safe
on shore from a shipwreck, which they drown all
in the nextbowl of punch, and forget, almost assoon
as it is over; and all the rest of my life was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due considera-
tion, made sensible of my condition; how I was
cast on this dreadful place, out of the reach of
human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect
of redemption; as soon as I saw but a prospect of
living, and that I should not starve and perish for
hunger, all the sense of my affliction wore off, and
I began to be very easy, applied myself to the
works proper for my preservation and supply, and
was far enough from being afflicted at my condi-
tion, as a judgment from heaven, or as the hand of
God against me: these were thoughts which very
seldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
journal, had at first some little influence upon me,
and began to affect me with seriousness, as long as
I thought it had something miraculous in it; but
as soon as ever that part of thought was removed,
all the impression which was raised from it wore
off also, as I have noted already. -
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately
directing to the invisible power, which alone directs
such things; yet no sooner was the first fright
over, but the impression it had made went off also ;
I had no more sense of GoD, or his judgments,
much less of the present affliction of my circum-
stances being from his hand, than if I had been in
the most prosperous condition of life. ,
But now, when I began to be sick, and a
leisurely view of the miseries of death came to
place itself before me; when my spirits began to
sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and
nature was exhausted with the violence of the
fever; conscience, that had slept so long, began
to awake, and I began to reproach myself with
my past life, in which I had so evidently, by un-
common wickedness, provoked the justice of GoD
to lay me under uncommon strokes, and to deal
with me in so vindictive a manner.
- These reflections oppressed me from the second
or third day of my distemper, and in the violence,
as well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches
of my conscience, extorted some words from me,
like praying to God, though I cannot say they
were either a prayer attended with desires, or with
hopes; it was rather the voice of mere fright and
distress: my thoughts were confused, the convic-
tions great upon my mind, and the horror. of dying
in such a miserable condition, raised vapours into
my head with the mere apprehensions; and, in
these hurries of my soul, I knew not what my
tongue might express. But it was rather exclama-
tion; such as, Lord! what a miserable creature am
I! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for
want of help, and what will become of me? Then
the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say
no more for a good while.
In this interval the good advice of my father
came to my mind, and presently his prediction,
which I mentioned in the beginning of this story;
viz. That if I did take this foolish step, GoD would
not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter
to reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when
there might be none to assist in my recovery.
Now, said I aloud, my dear father's words are
come to pass: God's justice has overtaken me, and
I have none to help or hear me; I rejected the
voice of Providence, which had mercifully put me
in a posture or station of life wherein I might have
been happy and easy; but I would neither see it
myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it from,
my parents; I left them to mourn over my folly,
and now I am left to mourn under the conse-
quences of it: I refused their help and assistance,
who would have lifted me into the world, and
would have made every thing easy to me; and
now I have difficulties to struggle with, too great
for even nature itself to support, and no assistance,
no help, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried out,
Lord, be my help, for I am in great distress!
This was the first prayer, if I might call it so, that
I had made for many years. But I return to my
journal. - -
June 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with
the sleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off,
I got up: and though the fright and terror of my
dream was very great, yet I considered, that the
fit of the ague would return again the next day,
and now was my time to get something to refresh
and support myself when I should be ill; and the
first thing I did, I filled a large square case bottle
with water, and set it upon my table, in reach of
my bed; and to take off the chill or aguish disposi-
tion of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them together: then I
got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it
on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked
about, but was very weak, and, withal, very sad
and heavy-hearted under a sense of my miserable
condition, dreading the return of my distemper the
next day: at night I made my supper of three of
the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes, and
eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was the first
bit of meat I had ever asked God's blessing to,
even, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found
myself so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun
(for I never went out without that); so I went but
a little way, and sat down upon the ground, looking
out upon the sea, which was just before me, and
very calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such
thoughts as these occurred to me:—
What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen
so much P Whence is it produced? And what am I,
and all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal; whence are we ?
Sure we are all made by some secret power, who
formed the earth and sea, the air and sky; and who
is that?
Then it followed, most naturally: it is GoD that
has made it all. Well, but then it came on strangely;
if GoD has made all these things, he guides and
governs them all, and all things that concern them;
for the Being that could make all things, must cer-
tainly have power to guide and direct them.
If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit
of his works, either without his knowledge or ap-
pointment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge,
he knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful con-
dition; and if nothing happens without his appoint-
ment, he has appointed all this to befal me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclusions; and therefore it rested
upon me with the greater force, that it must needs
be, that GoD had appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miserable circumstance
by his direction, he having the sole power, not of
me only, but of every thing that happened in the
world. Immediately it followed, -
Why has GoD done this to me? What have I
done to be thus used?
My conscience presently checked me in that
inquiry, as if I had blasphemed ; and methought it
spoke to me, like a voice; Wretch! dost thou ask
what thou hast done? Look back upon a dreadful
mispent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not
done? Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago
destroyed? Why wert thou not drowned in Yar-
mouth Roads 2 killed in the fight when the ship
was taken by the Sallee man of war 2 devoured by
the wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned
HERE, when all the crew perished but thyself?
Dost thou ask, What have I done P
I was struck with these reflections as one asto-
nished, and had not a word to say, no, not to an-
swer to myself; but rose up pensive and sad,
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts
were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the ap-
prehensions of the return of my distemper terrified
me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the
Brasilians take no physic but their tobacco, for
almost all distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of
tobacco in one of the chests, which was quite cured,
and some also that was green, and not quite cured.
128 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
this chest I found a cure both for soul and body
I opened the chest, and found what I looked for,
viz. the tobacco; and as the few books I had saved
lay there too, I took out one of the bibles which
I mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had
not found leisure, or so much as inclination, to look
into ; I say I took it out, and brought both that
and the tobacco with me to the table.
What use to make of the tobacco I knew not, as
to my distemper, or whether it was good for it or no;
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I re-
solved it should hit one way or other: I first took
a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth, which
indeed at first almost stupified my brain, the tobacco
being green and strong, and that I had not been
much used to it; then I took some, and steeped it
an hour or two in some rum, and resolved to take a
dose of it when I lay down ; and lastly, I burnt
some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close
over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as
well for the heat as the virtue of it, and I held al-
most to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, I took up the
bible, and began to read; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading,
at least at that time; only having opened the book
casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these, “Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.”
The words were very apt to my case, and made
some impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading them, though not so much as they did
afterwards; for, as for being delivered, the word
had no sound, as I may say, to me; the thing was
so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of
things, that I began to say as the children of Israel
did when they were promised flesh to eat, “Can
GoD spread a table in the wilderness?” so I began
to say, Can God himself deliver me from this
place ? And as it was not for many years that any
hope appeared, this prevailed very often upon my
thoughts; but, however, the words made a very
VOL. I. K
great impression upon me, and I mused upon them
very often. It grew now late, and the tobacco
had, as I said, dozed my head so much, that I in-
clined to sleep; so that I left my lamp burning in
the cave, lest I should want any thing in the night,
and went to bed : but before I lay down, I did
what I never had done in all my life; I kneeled
down and prayed to God to fulfil the promise to
me, that if I called upon him in the day of trouble,
he would deliver me. After my broken and im-
perfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which
I had steeped the tobacco, which was so strong
and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could scarce
get it down. Immediately upon this I went to
bed, and I found presently it flew up into my head
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked
no more, till by the sun it must necessarily be near
three o'clock in the afternoon the next day; nay,
to this hour I am partly of the opinion, that I
slept all the next day and night, and till almost
three the day after; for otherwise I knew not how
I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days
of the week, as it appeared some years after I had
done; for if I had lost it by crossing and recrossing
the line, I should have lost more than a day: but in
my account it was lost, and I never knew which
way.
Be that however one way or other, when I
awaked, I found myself exceedingly refreshed,
and my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got
up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and
my stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in
short, I had no fit the next day, but conti-
nued much altered for the better. This was the
29th.
The 30th was my well day, of course; and I
went abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel
too far: I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like
a brand goose, and brought them home, but was
not very forward to eat them: so I eat some more
of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This
evening Irenewed the medicine which I had sup-
posed did me good the day before, viz. the tobacco
steeped in rum; only I did not take so much as
before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke : however, I was not so well
the next day, which was the first of July, as I hoped
I should have been ; for I had a little spice of the
cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it at first, and doubled
the quantity which I drank.
July 8. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts run exceedingly upon this scripture, “I
will deliver thee;” and the impossibility of my de-
liverance lay much upon my mind, in bar of my
ever expecting it: but as I was discouraging my-
self with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind,
that I pored so much upon my deliverance from
the main affliction, that I disregarded the deliver-
K 2
ance I had received; and I was, as it were, made
to ask myself such questions as these ; viz. Have
I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from
sickness? from the most distressed condition that
could be, and that was so frightful to me? and what
notice had I taken of it? had I done my part? God
had delivered me: but I had not glorified him :
that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful
for that as a deliverance; and how could I expect
greater deliverance 2
- This touched my heart very much, and immedi-
ately I kneeled down, and gave God thanks aloud,
for my recovery from my sickness.
July 4. In the morning I took the bible; and,
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read awhile
every morning and every night, not tying myself
to the number of chapters, but as long as my
thoughts should engage me: it was not long after
I set seriously to this work, but I found my heart
more deeply and sincerely affected with the wick-
edness of my past life; the impression of my dream
revived, and the words, All these things have not
brought thee to repentance, ran seriously in my
thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God to give
me repentance, when it happened providentially
the very day, that, reading the scripture, I came
to these words, “He is exalted a Prince and a
Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remission.”
I threw down the book, and with my heart as well
as my hand lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstacy
of joy, I cried out aloud, Jesus, thou Son of David,
Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me
repentance
This was the first time that I could say, in the
true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life;
for now I prayed with a sense of my condition, and
with a true scripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the word of God; and from this
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, “Call on me, and I will deliver thee,” in a
different sense from what I had ever done before;
for then I had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the
captivity I was in ; for though I was indeed at
large in the place, yet the island was certainly a
prison to me, and that, in the worst sense in the
world; but now I learned to take it in another
sense. Now I looked back upon my past life with
such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful, that
my soul sought nothing of God, but deliverance
from the load of guilt that bore down all my com-
fort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did
not so much as pray to be delivered from it, or
think of it; it was all of no consideration, in com-
parison of this: and I added this part here, to hint
to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come
to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance
from sin a much greater blessing than deliverance
from affliction.
K 3
But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier
to my mind; and my thoughts being directed by a
constant reading the Scripture, and praying to
God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which till now I knew no-
thing of: also as my health and strength returned,
I bestirred myself to furnish myself with every
thing that I wanted, and make my way of living as
regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sick-
mess; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was,
and to what weakness I was reduced. The appli-
cation which I made use of was perfectly new, and
perhaps what had never cured an ague before ;
neither can I recommend it to any one to practise
by this experiment; and though it did carry off
the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken me; for
I had frequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs
for some time.
I learnt from it also this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy season was the most pernicious
thing to my health that could be, especially in
those rains which came attended with storms and
hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came
in a dry season was always most accompanied with
such storms, so I found this rain was much more
dangerous than the rain which fell in September
and October.
I had been now in this unhappy island above
ten months; all possibility of deliverance from
this condition seemed to be entirely taken from
me; and I firmly believed that no human shape
had ever set foot upon that place. Having now
secured my habitation, as I thought, fully to my
mind, I had a great desire to make a more perfect
discovery of the island, and to see what other pro-
ductions I might find, which yet I knew nothing
of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island itself; I went
up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I brought
my rafts on shore. I found, after I came about
two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher,
and that it was no more than a little brook of run-
ning water, and very fresh and good; but this being
the dry season, there was hardly any water in some
parts of it, at least not enough to run into any
stream, so as it could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many plea-
sant savannas or meadows, plain, smooth, and co-
vered with grass; and on the rising parts of them
next to the higher grounds, where the water, as it
Inight be supposed, never overflowed, I found a
great deal of tobacco, green, and growing to a
great and very strong stalk: there were divers
other plants which I had no notion of, or under-

standing about ; and might perhaps have virtues
of their own, which I could not find out.
I searched for the cassave root, which the In-
dians in all that climate make their bread of, but
I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but
did not then understand them: I saw several sugar
canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented myself with these discove-
ries for this time, and came back musing with
myself what course I might take to know the vir-
tue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants
which I should discover, but could bring it to no
conclusion: for, in short, I had made so little ob-
servation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew
little of the plants of the field, at least very little
that might serve me to any purpose now in my
distress.
* . The next day, the 16th, I went up the same
way again; and, after going something farther
than I had done the day before, I found the brook
and the savannas began to cease, and the country
became more woody than before. In this part I
found different fruits, and particularly I found
melons upon the ground in great abundance, and
grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread indeed
over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just
now in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was
a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding glad
of them, but I was warned by my experience to
eat sparingly of them, remembering that, when I
was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen who were slaves there,
by throwing them into fluxes and fevers: but I
found an excellent use for these grapes, and that
was to cure or dry them in the sun and keep them
as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought
would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome,
and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might be
had. -
I spent all that evening there, and went not
back to my habitation, which by the way was the
first night, as I might say, I had lain from home.
In the night I took my first contrivance, and got
up into a tree, where I slept well, and the next
morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling
near four miles, as I might judge by the length of
the valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of
hills on the south and north side of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way,
that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being
in a constant verdure or flourishing of spring, that
it looked like a planted garden. -
I descended a little on the side of that delicious
valley, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was king
and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had
a right of possession; and if I could convey it, I
might have it in inheritance, as completely as any
lord of a manor in England. I saw here abun-
dance of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon, and ci-
tron-trees, but all wild, and few bearing any
fruit; at least, not then : however, the green limes
that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but
very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards
with water, which made it very wholesome, and
very cool and refreshing.
I found now I had business enough to gather
and carry home; and resolved to lay up a store,
as well of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish
myself for the wet season, which I knew was ap-
proaching.
In order to do this I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lesser heap in another
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a few of each with me,
I travelled homeward, and resolved to come again,
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make,
to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this
journey, I came home (so I must now call my
tent, and my cave); but before I got thither, the
grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruit, and
the weight of the juice, having broken them, and
bruised them, they were good for little or nothing:
as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring
but a few.
The next day, being the 19th, I went back,
having made me two small bags to bring home
my harvest. But I was surprised, when coming to
my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine
when I gathered them, I found them all spread
abroad, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some
here, some there, and abundance eaten and de-
voured. By this I concluded there were some wild
creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but
what they were I knew not.
However, as I found there was no laying them
up on heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack,
but that one way they would be destroyed, and
the other way they would be crushed with their
own weight, I took another course; for I gathered
a large quantity of the grapes, and hung them
upon the out branches of the trees, that they might
cure and dry in the sun; and as for the limes and
lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.
When I came home from this journey, I con-
templated with great pleasure on the fruitfulness
of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situa-
tion, the security from storms on that side of the
water, and the wood; and concluded that I had
pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was
by far the worst part of the country. Upon the
whole, I began to consider of removing my habi-
tation, and to look out for a place equally safe as
where I now was situated, if possible, in that plea-
sant fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was
exceeding fond of it for some time, the pleasant-
mess of the place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I was
now by the sea side, where it was at least possible
that something might happen to my advantage,
and that the same ill fate that brought me hither,
might bring some other unhappy wretches to the
same place; and though it was scarce probable
that any such thing should ever happen, yet to en-
close myself among the hills and woods, in the
centre of the island, was to anticipate my bondage,
and to render such an affair not only improbable,
but impossible; and that therefore I ought not by
any means to remove.
However, I was so enamoured with this place,
that I spent much of my time there for the whole
remaining part of the month of July; and though,
upon second thoughts I resolved as above, not to
remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower,
and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as high as I could reach,
well staked and filled between with brushwood;
and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three
nights together, always going over it with a lad-
der, as before ; so that I fancied now I had my
country house, and my sea-coast house: and this
work took me up the beginning of August.
: I had but newly finished my fence, and began
to enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and
made me stick close to my first habitation; for
though I had made me a tent like the other, with
a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had
not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,
nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the
rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning of August, as I said, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myself.
The third of August I found the grapes I had
hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were
excellent good raisins of the sun : so I began to
take them down from the trees, and it was very
happy that I did so; for the rains which followed
would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best
part of my winter food; for I had above two hun.
dred large bunches of them. No sooner had I
taken them all down, and carried most of them
home to my cave, but it began to rain; and from
thence, which was the fourteenth of August, it
rained more or less every day, till the middle of
October; and sometimes so violently, that I could
not stir out of my cave for several days. -
In this season I was much surprised with the
increase of my family: I had been concerned for
the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me,
or, as I thought, had been dead; and I heard no
more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment,
she came home about the end of August, with
three kittens. This was the more strange to me,
because though I had killed a wild cat, as I called
it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite dif.
ferent kind from our European cats; yet the young
cats were the same kind of house breed like the
old one; and both my cats being females, I thought
it very strange: but from these three cats, I after-
wards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts,
and to drive them from my house as much as
possible.
From the fourteenth of August to the twenty-
sixth, incessant rain, so that I could not stir, and
was now very careful not to be much wet. In
this confinement I began to be straitened for food;
but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat:
and the last day, which was the twenty-sixth,
found a very large tortoise, which was a treat to
me; and my food was regulated thus: I eat a
bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the
goat's flesh, or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled
(for to my great misfortune I had no vessel to boil
or stew any thing), and two or three of the turtle’s
eggs for supper.
During this confinement in my cover by the
rain, I worked daily two or three hours at enlarg-
ing my cave; and, by degrees, worked it on to-
wards one side, till I came to the outside of the
hill, and made a door or way out, which came be-
yond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out
this way: but I was not perfectly easy at laying
so open; for as I had managed myself before, I
was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now I thought
Ilay exposed; and yet I could not perceive that
there was any living thing to fear, the biggest crea-
ture that I had seen upon the island being a
goat.
September the thirtieth. I was now come to the
unhappy anniversary of my landing: I cast up the
notches on my post, and found I had been on shore
three hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day
as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious ex-
ercise, prostrating myself to the ground with the
most serious humiliation, confessing myself to GoD,
acknowledging his righteous judgment upon me,
and praying to him to have mercy on me, through
Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least re-
freshment for twelve hours, even to the going down
of the sun, I then eat a biscuit-cake, and a bunch
of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I
began it.
I had all this time observed no Sabbath-day; for
as at first I had no sense of religion upon my mind,
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary
for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know
what any of the days were; but now, having cast
up the days as above, I found I had been there a
year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart
every seventh day for a Sabbath; though 1 found
at the end of my account I had lost a day or two of
my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and
so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and
to write down only the most remarkable events of
my life, without continuing a daily memorandum
of other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide
them so as to provide for them accordingly. But I
bought all my experience before I had it; and this
I am going to relate, was one of the most discou-
raging experiments that I made at all. I have
mentioned, that I had saved the few ears of barley
and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring
up, as I thought, of themselves, and believe there
were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty
of barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow
it after the rains, the sun being in its southern po-
sition going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well
as I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was
sowing, it casually occurred to my thought, that
I would not sow it all at first, because I did not
know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed
about two thirds of the seeds, leaving about an
handful of each. It was a great comfort to me
afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of that
I sowed this time came to any thing; for the dry
months following, the earth having had no rain
after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to
assist its growth, and never came up at all, till the
wet season had come again, and then it grew as if
it had been newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily
imagined was by the drought, I sought for a moister
piece of ground to make another trial in ; and I
dug up a piece of ground near my new bower, and
sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little be-
fore the vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy
months of March and April to water it, sprung up
very pleasantly, and yielded a very good crop; but
having part of the seed left only, and not daring to
sow all that I had yet, I had but a small quantity
at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half
a peck of each kind. - -
But by this experience I was made master of my
business, and knew exactly when the proper season
was to sow ; and that I might expect two seed
times, and two harvests every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little
discovery, which was of use to me afterwards. As
soon as the rains were over, and the weather began
to settle, which was about the month of Novem-
ber, I made a visit up the country to my bower,
where though I had not been some months, yet I
found all things just as I left them. The circle or
double hedge that I had made, was not only firm
and entire, but the stakes which I had cut off of
some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot
out, and grown with long branches, as much as a
willow tree usually shoots the first year after lop-
ping its head. I could not tell what tree to call
it that these stakes were cut from. I was sur-
prised, and yet very well pleased, to see the young
trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up
to grow as much alike as I could, and it is scarce
credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in
three years; so that though the hedge made a circle
VOL. I. L

of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the
trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered
it; and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge
under all the dry season.
This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me an hedge like this in a semicircle
round my wall, I mean that of my first dwelling,
which I did; and placing the trees or stakes in a
double row, at above eight yards distance from
my first fence, they grew presently, and were at
first a fine cover to my habitation, and afterwards
served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its
order.
I found now, that the seasons of the year might
generally be divided, not into summer and winter,
as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the
dry seasons, which were generally thus:
Half Feb 9 - -
3. ‘. Rainy, the sun being then on or
Half April near the equinox.
Half April, -

Half October, back.
Half October, )
November,
December | Dry, the sun being then to the
January r south of the line.
Half February,
The rainy season sometimes held longer or
shorter, as the winds happened to blow; but this
was the general observation I made. After I had
found, by experience, the ill consequence of being
abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself
with provision beforehand, that I might not be
obliged to go out; and I sat within doors as much
as possible during the wet months.
In this time I found much employment, (and
very suitable also to the time) for I found great
occasion of many things which I had no way to
furnish myself with, but by hard labour and con-
stant application : particularly, I tried many ways
to make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could
get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they
would do nothing. It proved of excellent advan-
tage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to
take great delight in standing at a basket-maker’s
in the town where my father lived, to see them
make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually
are, very officious to help, and a great observer of
the manner how they worked those things, and
sometimes lent a hand, I had by this means so full
knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
L 2
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut
my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as
the sallows and willows, and osiers, in England;
and I resolved to try.
Accordingly the next day I went to my coun-
try house, as I called it, and cutting some of the
smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as
much as I could desire; whereupon I came the
next time prepared with an hatchet to cut down a
quantity, which I soon found, for there was a
great plenty of them: these I set up to dry within
my circle or hedges; and when they were fit for
use, I carried them to my cave; and here during
the next season I employed myself in making (as
well as I could) a great many baskets, both to
carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing, as I
had occasion; and though I did not finish them
very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently
serviceable for my purpose; and thus afterwards
I took care never to be without them; and as my
wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially I
made strong deep baskets to place my corn in, in-
stead of sacks, when I should come to have any
quantity of it. -
Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see,
if possible, how to supply two wants. I had no
vessels to hold any thing that was liquid, except
two rundlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and
others which were case-bottles square, for the
holding of waters, spirits, &c. I had not so much
as a pot to boil any thing in, except a great ket-
tle which I saved out of the ship, and which was
too big for such uses as I desired it for, viz. to
make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself. The
second thing I would fain have had, was a to-
bacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to make
one; however I found a contrivance for that too
at last.
I employed myself in planting my second rows
of stakes of piles, and in this wicker work, all the
summer, or dry season; when another business
took me up more time than it could be imagined I
could spare. - -
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to
see the whole island, and that I had travelled up
the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,
and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the sea-shore on that side: so taking
my gun, and hatchet, and my dog, and a larger
quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two
biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When
I had passed the vale where my bower stood, as
above, I came within view of the sea, to the west;
and it being a very clear day, Ifairly descried land,
whether an island or continent I could not tell;
but it lay very high, extending from the West
to the W. S. W. at a very great distance; by my
guess it could not be less than fifteen or twenty
leagues off.
L 3
I could not tell what part of the world this
might be, otherwise than that I knew it must be
part of America; and, as I concluded by all my
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where
if I should have landed, I had been in a worse
condition than I was now ; and therefore I acqui-
esced in the dispositions of Providence, which I
began now to own, and to believe, ordered every
thing for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with
this, and left afflicting myself with fruitless wishes
of being there.
Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I con-
sidered, that if this land was the Spanish coast, I
should certainly, one time or other, see some ves-
sels pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then
it was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and Brasil, which were indeed the worst of savages;
for they are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not
to murder and devour all the human bodies that
fall into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very lei-
surely forward. I found that side of the island
where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the
open or savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers
and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw
abundance of parrots, and fain would F have
caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame,
and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some
pains taken, catch a young parrot; for I knocked
it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I
brought it home, but it was some years before I
could make him speak. However, at last I taught
him to call me by my name, very familiarly : but
the accident that followed, though it be a trifle,
will be very diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low grounds, hares as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with ; nor could Isatisfy
myself to eat them, though I killed several: but I
had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too: espe-
cially these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and
turtle or tortoise; which, added to my grapes,
Leadenhall market could not have furnished a
better table than I, in proportion to the company:
and though my case was deplorable enough, yet I
had great cause for thankfulness, that I was not
driven to any extremities for food; but rather
plenty, even to dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so
many turns and returns, to see what discoveries I
could make, that I came weary enough to the
place where I resolved to sit down for all night;
and then either reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
rounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in
the ground, either from one tree to another, or so
as no wild creature could come at me without
waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was sur-
L 4
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island; for here indeed the shore
was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on
the other side I had found but three in a year and
a half. Here was also an infinite number of fowls
of many kinds, some of which I had not seen be-
fore, and many of them very good meat; but such
as I knew not the names of except those called
penguins. -
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot: and there-
fore had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on ; and though there
were many more goats here than on the other side
of the island, yet it was with much more difficulty
that I could come near them; the country being
flat and even, and they saw me much sooner than
when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the country was much plea-
santer than mine, but yet I had not the least incli-
nation to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation,
it became natural to me; and I seemed all the
while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey,
and from home. However, I travelled along the
shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose, about
twelve miles; and then setting up a great pole upon
the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again; and the next journey I took should be on
the other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round, till I came to my post again: of
which in its place.
, I took another way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could easily keep all the island so
much in my view, that I could not miss finding
my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I
found myself mistaken ; for being come about two
or three miles, I found myself descended into a
very large valley; but so surrounded with hills,
and those hills covered with woods, that I could
not see which was my way by any direction but
that of the sun; nor even then, unless I knew
very well the position of the sun at that time of
the day. - . . . . "
It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while
I was in this valley; and not being able to see the
sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at
last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for
my post, and come back the same way I went; and
then by easy journies I turned homeward, the wea-
ther being exceeding hot; and my gun, ammuni-
tion, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog surprised a young kid,
and seized upon it; and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the dog. I
had a great mind to bring it home, if I could ; for
I had often been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed
of tame goats, which might supply me when my
powder and shot should be spent. -
I made a collar for this little creature; and with
a string which I made of some rope-yarn, which I
always carried about me, I led him along, though
with some difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there I inclosed him, and left him; for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
absent above a month.
I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to
me to come into my old hutch, and lie down in
my hammock-bed: this little wandering journey,
without a settled place of abode, had been so un-
pleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to
myself, was a perfect settlement to me, compared
to that ; and it rendered every thing about me so
comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a
great way from it again, while it should be my lot
to stay on the island.
I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale
myself after my long journey; during which, most
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be
a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began now to think of the poor
kid, which I had pent in within my little circle,
and resolved to go and fetch it home, and give it
some food: accordingly I went, and found it where
I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but was
almost starved for want of food. I went and cut
boughs of trees and branches of such shrubs as I
could find, and threw it over; and having fed it,
I tied it as I did before to lead it away; but it was
so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to
have tied it; for it followed me like a dog; and as
I continually fed it, the creature became so loving,
so gentle, and so fond, that it became from that
time one of my domestics also, and would never
leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 80th of September in
the same solemn manner as before, being the anni-
versary of my landing on the island, having now
been there two years, and no more prospect of
being delivered than the first day I came there. I
spent the whole day in humble and thankful ac-
knowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
which my solitary condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks,
that God had been pleased to discover to me, even
that it was possible I might be more happy in this
solitary condition, than I should have been in a
liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of the
world: that he could fully make up to me the de-
ficiencies of my solitary state and the want of hu-
man society, by his presence, and the communica-
tion of his grace to my soul, supporting, comfort-
ing, and encouraging me to depend upon his pro-
vidence here, and hope for his eternal presence
hereafter.
It was now that I began sensibly to feel how
much more happy the life I now led was, with all
its miserable circumstances, than the wicked cursed
abominable life I led all the past part of my days;
and now, having changed both my sorrows and my
joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gust, and my delights were perfectly new
from what they were at first coming, or indeed for
the two years past. -
Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my soul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
sudden, and my very heart would die within me,
to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts
I was in ; and how I was a prisoner, locked up
with the eternal bolts and bars of the ocean, in an
uninhabited wilderness, without redemption. In
the midst of the greatest composures of my mind,
this would break out upon me like a storm, and
made me wring my hands, and weep like a child.
Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my
work, and I would immediately sit down and
sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two
together; and this was still worse to me; for if I
could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words,
it would go off, and the grief, having exhausted
itself, would abate.
But now I began to exercise myself with new
thoughts; I daily read the word of God, and ap-
plied all the comforts of it to my present state.
One morning, being very sad, I opened the bible
upon these words, “I will never, never leave thee,
nor forsake thee!” Immediately it occurred, that
these words were to me, why else should they be
directed in such a manner, just at the moment
when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of GoD and man 2 Well then, said I, if
GoD does not forsake me, of what ill consequence
can it be, or what matters it, though the world
should all forsake me; seeing on the other hand,
if I had all the world, and should lose the favour
and blessing of God, there would be no comparison
in the loss 2
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forsaken, solitary condition, than it was pro-
bable I should have ever been in any other parti-
cular state in the world; and with this thought I
was going to give thanks to GoD for bringing me
to this place. - -
I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak
the words. How canst thou be such an hypocrite
(said I, even audibly), to pretend to be thankful
for a condition, which, however thou mayestendea-
vour to be contented with, thou wouldest rather
pray heartily to be delivered from ? So I stopped
there; but though I could not say I thanked GoD
for being there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to GoD
for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting provi-
dences, to see the former condition of my life, and
to mourn for my wickedness, and repent. I never
opened the bible, or shut it, but my very soul
within me blessed God for directing my friend in
England, without any order of mine, to pack it up
among my goods; and for assisting me afterwards
to save it out of the wreck of the ship.
Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began
my third year; and though I have not given the
reader the trouble of so particular an account of
my works this year as at the first, yet in general
it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle;
having regularly divided my time, according to
the several daily employments that were before
me; such as, first, my duty to GoD, and reading
the scriptures, which I constantly set apart some
time for, thrice every day. Secondly, the going
abroad with my gun for food, which generally
took me up three hours every morning when it
did not rain. Thirdly, the ordering, curing,
preserving, and cooking what I had killed or
caught for my supply. These took up great part
of the day. Also it is to be considered, that in the
middle of the day, when the sun was in the ze-
nith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir
out; so that about four hours in the evening was
all the time I could be supposed to work in ; with
this exception, that sometimes I changed my
hours of hunting and working, and went to work
in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the
afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I desire
may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my
work; the many hours which, for want of tools,
want of help, and want of skill, every thing that I
did took up out of my time: for example, I was
full two-and-forty days making me a board for a
long shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas
two sawyers, with their tools and saw-pit, would have
cut six of them out of the same tree in half a day.
My case was this: It was to be a large tree
which was to be cut down, because my board was
to be a broad one. The tree I was three days a
cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs,
and reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With
inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both
the sides of it into chips, till it began to be light
enough to move ; then I turned it, and made one
side of it smooth and flat, as a board, from end to
end: then turning that side downward, cut the
other side till I brought the plank to be about three
inches thick, and smooth on both sides. Any one
may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece
of work; but labour and patience carried me
through that and many other things; I only ob-
serve this in particular, to shew the reason why
so much of my time went away with so little work,
viz. That what might be a little to be done with
help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a
prodigious time to do alone, and by hand.
But notwithstanding this, with patience and la-
bour I went through many things, and indeed every
thing that my circumstances made necessary for
me to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now in the months of November and De-
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost
one whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but
now my crop promised very well, when on a sud-
den I found I was in danger of losing it all again
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce
possible to keep from it; at first, the goats, and
wild creatures which I called hares, which, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day,
as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into stalks.
This I saw no remedy for, but by making an
inclosure about it with an hedge, which I did with
a great deal of toil; and the more, because it re-
quired a great deal of speed; the creatures daily
spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally
well fenced in about three weeks time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day-time, I set
my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to
a stake at the gate, where he would stand and
bark all night long : so in a little time the enemies
forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my
corn was in the blade, so the birds were as like to
ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for going
along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my
little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not
how many sorts, which stood as it were watching
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among
them, (for I always had my gun with me.) I had
no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud
of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among
the corn itself. - -
This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that
in a few days they would devour all my hopes:
that I should be starved, and never be able to
raise a crop at all; and what to do I could not
tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if
possible, though I should watch it night and day.
In the first place, I went among it to see what
damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet
too green for them, the loss was not so great, but
the remainder was like to be a good crop, if it
could be saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon
all the trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the event proved it to be so;
for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was no
sooner out of their sight, but they dropped down
one by one into the corn again. I was so provoked,
that I could not have patience to stay till more
came on, knowing that every grain that they eat
now was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in
the consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I
fired again, and killed three of them. This was
what I wished for; so I took them up, and served
them as we serve notorious thieves in England,
viz. hanged them in chains, for a terror to others.
It is impossible to imagine almost, that this should
have such an effect as it had ; for the fowls would
VOL. I. M
not only not come at the corn, but in short they
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never
see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows
hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one
as well as I could, out of one of the broad-swords,
or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of
the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I
had no great difficulty to cut it down : in short, I
reaped it my way, for I cut nothing off but the
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which
I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands:
and at the end of all my harvesting I found, that
out of my half-peck of seed, I had near two
bushels of rice, and above two bushels and a half
of barley, that is to say, by my guess, for I had
no measure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to
me; and I foresaw that in time it would please
God to supply me with bread: and yet here I was
perplexed again; for I neither knew how to grind
or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean
it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to
make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it. These things being
added to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all
for seed against the next season, and in the mean
time to employ all my study and hours of working
to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe
few people have thought much upon; viz. the
strange multitude of little things necessary in the
providing, producing, curing, dressing, making,
and finishing, this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found
this to be my daily discouragement, and was made
more and more sensible of it every hour, even after
. I got the first handful of seed corn, which, as I have
said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by mak-
ing a wooden spade, as I observed before, but this
did my work but in a wooden manner; and though
it cost me a great many days to make it, yet for
want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but
made my work the harder, and made it be per-
formed much worse.
However, this I bore with too, and was content
to work it out with patience, and bear with the
badness of the performance. When the corn was
sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go over
it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree
over it, to scratch the earth, as it may be called,
rather than rake or harrow it.
M 2
When it was growing or grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it,
secure it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home,
thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake
it in; and all these things I did without, as shall
be observed ; and yet the corn was an inestimable
comfort and advantage to me too : but all this, as
I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to
me, but that there was no help for; neither was
my time so much loss to me, because I had divided
it. A certain part of it was every day appointed
to these works; and as I resolved to use none of the
corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, .
I had the next six months to apply myself, wholly
by labour and invention, to furnish myself with
utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for the making the corn, when I had it,
fit for my use.
But first I was to prepare more land, for I had
now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground.
Before I did this, I had a week’s work at least to
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was a
very sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required
double labour to work with it; however, I went
through that, and sowed my seeds in two large flat
pieces of ground, as near my house as I could find
them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that
wood which I had set before, which I knew would
grow; so that in one year's time I knew I should
have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take
me up less than three months; because great part
of that time was in the wet season, when I could
not go abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
occasion, always observing, that all the while I
was at work, I diverted myself with talking to my
parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly
learnt him to know his own name; at last, to speak
it out pretty loud, Poll; which was the first word
I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth
but my own. This therefore was not my work,
but an assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I
had a great employment upon my hands, as fol-
lows: viz. I had long studied, by some means or
other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to
come at them : however, considering the heat of
the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out
any such clay, I might botch up some such pot,
as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough,
and strong enough, to bear handling, and to hold
any thing that was dry, and required to be kept
so; and as this was necessary in preparing corn,
meal, &c. which was the thing I was upon, I re-
solved to make some as large as I could, and fit
only to stand like jars to hold what should be put
into them.
M 3
It would make the reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many aukward ways I
took to raise this paste, what odd misshapen ugly
things I made, how many of them fell in, and how
many fell out, the clay not being stiff enough to
bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over violent heat of the sun, being set out too
hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only
removing, as well before as after they were dried;
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard
to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home, and work it, I could not make above two
large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jars,
in about two months labour.
However, as the sun baked these two very dry
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and set
them down again in two greater wicker baskets,
which I had made on purpose for them, that they
might not break; and, as between the pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed
it full of the rice and barley straw; and these two
pots being to stand always dry, I thought would
hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when the
corn was bruised.
Though I miscarried so much in my design for
large pots, yet I made several smaller things with
better success; such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand
turned to ; and the heat of the sun baked them
strangely hard.
But all this would not answer my end, which
was to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid,
and bear the fire, which none of these could do.
It happened after some time, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro-
ken piece of one of my earthen-ware vessels in the
fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a tile. I
was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to my-
self, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to order my fire, so
as to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion
of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of glazing
them with lead, though I had some lead to do it
with ; but I placed three large pipkins, and two
or three pots, in a pile one upon another, and
placed my fire-wood all round it, with a great heap
of embers under them: I plied the fire with fresh
fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till I saw
the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all : when I
saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat
about five or six hours, till I found one of them,
though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the
sand which was mixed with the clay, melted by
the violence of the heat, and would have run into
glass, if I had gone on ; so I slacked my fire gra-
dually, till the pots began to abate of the red co-
lour; and watching them all night, that I might
not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I
had three very good, I will not say handsome pip-
M 4
kins, and two other earthen pots, as hard burnt as
could be desired; and one of them perfectly glazed
with the running of the sand.
After this experiment I need not say that I
wanted no sort of earthen-ware for my use ; but
I must needs say, as to the shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may suppose,
when I had no way of making them, but as the
children make dirt-pies, or as a woman would
make pies that never learnt to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly pa-
tience to stay till they were cold, before I set one
upon the fire again, with some water in it, to boil
me some meat, which I did admirably well; and
with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth,
though I wanted oatmeal, and several other ingre-
dients requisite to make it so good as I would have
had it.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar
to stamp or beat some corn in ; for as to the mill,
there was no thought of arriving to that perfection
of art with one pair of hands. To supply this
want, I was at a great loss; for of all trades in the
world I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-
cutter, as for any whatever; neither had I any
tools to go about it with. I spent many a day to
find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow,
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at
all, except what was in the solid rock, and which
I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were
the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would
neither bear the weight of an heavy pestle, nor
would break the corn without filling it with sand;
so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out a
great block of hard wood, which I found indeed
much easier; and getting one as big as I had
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outside with my axe and hatchet; and then, with
the help of fire and infinite labour, made an hollow
place in it, as the Indians in Brasil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy-pestle
or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood; and
this I prepared and laid by against I had my next
crop of corn, when I proposed to myself to grind,
or rather pound, my corn or meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce,
to dress my meal, and part it from the bran and
the husk, without which I did not see it possible I
could have any bread. This was a most difficult
thing, so much as but to think on ; for to be sure,
I had nothing like the necessary things to make
it with ; I mean fine thin canvass, or stuff, to searce
the meal through. And here I was at a full stop
for many months; nor did I really know what to
do: linen I had none left but what was mere rags;
I had goat's hair, but neither knew I how to weave
or spin it; and had I known how, here were no
tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found
for this, was, that at last I did remember I had
among the seamen's clothes, which were saved out
of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin;
and with some pieces of these I made three small
sieves, but proper enough for the work: and thus
I made shift for some years; how I did afterwards,
I shall shew in its place.
The baking part was the next thing to be con-
sidered, and how I should make bread when I
came to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As
to that part, there was no supplying the want, so
I did not concern myself much about it. But for
an oven, I was indeed in great pain. At length I
found out an experiment for that also, which was
this: I made some earthen vessels very broad, but
not deep; that is to say, about two feet diameter,
and not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in
the fire, as I had done the other, and laid them
by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with some
square tiles of my own making and burning also ;
but I should not call them square. -
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon
this hearth, so as to cover it all over; and there I
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot: then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf,
or loaves; and whelming down the earthen pot
upon them, drew the embers all round the outside
of the pot, to keep in, and add to the heat: and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I
baked my barley-loaves, and became in a little
time a mere pastry-cook into the bargain; for I
made myself several cakes of the rice, and pud-
dings; indeed I made no pies, neither had I any
thing to put into them, supposing I had, except
the flesh either of fowls or goats.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took me up most part of the third year of my
abode here; for it is to be observed, that in the
intervals of these things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: for I reaped my corn
in its season, and carried it home as well as I could,
and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till
I had time to rub it out; for I had no floor to
thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.
And now indeed, my stock of corn increasing,
I really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted
a place to lay it up in ; for the increase of the corn
now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley
about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more ; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to
use it freely, for my bread had been quite gone a
great while: also I resolved to see what quantity
would be sufficient for me a whole year, and to
sow but once a year.
. Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels
of barley and rice were much more than I could
consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in
hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may
be sure my thoughts ran many times upon the
prospect of land which I had seen from the other
side of the island; and I was not without secret
wishes that I was on shore there, fancying that
seeing the main land, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself far-
ther, and perhaps at last find some means of escape.
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of such a condition, and how I mightfall
into the hands of Savages, and perhaps such as I
might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa: that if I once came into
their power, I should run an hazard more than a
thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of
being eaten; for I had heard that the people of
the Caribean coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters;
and I knew by the latitude that I could not be
far off from that shore: that, suppose they were
not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had
been served, even when they had been ten or
twenty together; much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. All these
things, I say, which I ought to have considered
well of, and I did cast up in my thoughts after-
wards, yet took none of my apprehensions at first;
and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts of
getting over to that shore.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long
boat with the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which
I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of
Africa; but this was in vain. Then I thought I
would go and look on our ship's boat, which, as I
have said, was blown up upon the shore a great
way in the storm, when we were first cast away.
She lay almost where she did at first, but not
quite ; and was turned, by the force of the waves
and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the
high ridge of a beachy rough sand, but no water
about her as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and
have launched her into the water, the boat would
have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the Brasils with her easy enough; but I
might have easily foreseen, that I could no more
turn her, and set her upright upon her bottom,
than I could remove the island. However I went
to the wood, and cut levers and rollers, and brought
them to the boat, resolving to try what I could
do ; suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn
her down, I might easily repair the damage she
had received, and she would be a very good boat,
and I might go to sea in her very easily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless
toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks about
it: at last finding it impossible to heave it up with
my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand
to undermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting
pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to stir
it up again, or to get under it, much less to move
it forwards towards the water; so I was forced to
give it over: and yet, though I gave over hopes
of the boat, my desire to venture over for the
main increased, rather than decreased, as the means
for it seemed impossible.
This at length set me upon thinking whether it
was not possible to make myself a canoe or pe-
riagua, such as the natives of those climates make,
even without tools, or as I might say, without
hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I
not only thought possible, but easy; and pleased
myself extremely with my thoughts of making it,
and with my having much more convenience for
it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at
all considering the particular inconveniences which
I lay under more than the Indians did, viz. want
of hands to move it into the water, when it was
made; a difficulty much harder for me to surmount
than all the consequences of want of tools could
be to them : for what was it to me, that when I
had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might with
great trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able
with my tools to hew and dub the outside into a
proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the
inside to make it hollow, so to make a boat of it;
if, after all this, I must leave it just there where I
found it, and was not able to launch it into the
Water?
One would have thought, I could not have had
the least reflection upon my mind of my circum-
stances, while I was making my boat, but I should
have immediately thought how I should get it
into the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon
my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once
considered how I should get it off the land; and
it was really in its own nature more easy for me to
guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about
forty-five fathom of land, where it lay, to set it
afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a
fool that ever man did, who had any of his senses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my
own inquiries into it by this foolish answer, which
I gave myself; Let me first make it, I will war-
rant I will find some way or other to get it along,
when it is done.
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
went, and felled a cedar tree: I question much
whether Solomon ever had such an one for the
building the temple of Jerusalem; it was five feet
ten inches diameter at the lower part next the
stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the
end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened for
a while, and then parted into branches. It was
not without infinite labour that I felled this tree;
I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the
bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limbs, and the vast spreading head of it cut
off, which I hacked and hewed through with my
axe and hatchet, with inexpressible labour; after
this it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it to
a proportion, and to something like the bottom of
a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to
do. It cost me near three months more to clear
the inside, and work it out so as to make an exact
boat of it: this I did indeed without fire, by mere
mallet and chissel, and by the dint of hard labour;
till I had brought it to be a very handsome pe-
riagua, and big enough to have carried six-and-
twenty men, and consequently big enough to have
carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was
extremely delighted with it: the boat was really
much bigger than I ever saw a canoe or periagua,
that was made of one tree, in my life; many a
weary stroke it had cost, you may be sure, for
there remained nothing but to get it into the
water; and had I gotten it into the water, I make
no question but I should have begun the maddest
voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed,
that ever was undertaken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, though they cost infinite labour too; it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this
discouragement, I resolved to dig into the surface
of the earth, and so make a declivity; this I began,
and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains: but who
grudge pains that have their deliverance in view 2
But when this was worked through, and this diffi-
culty managed, it was still much at one; for I could
no more stir the canoe than I could the other boat.
Then I measured the distance of ground, and re-
solved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water
up to the canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water. Well, I began this work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff
to be thrown out, I found, that by the number of
hands I had, being none but my own, it must have
been ten or twelve years before I should have gone
through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at
the upper end it must have been at least twenty
feet deep; so at length, though with great reluc-
tancy, I gave this attempt over also.
This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our
own strength to go through with it.
In the middle of this work I finished my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniversary with
the same devotion, and with as much comfort, as
ever before; for by a constant study, and serious
application of the word of God, and by the assist-
ance of his grace, I gained a different knowledge
from what I had before ; I entertained different
notions of things; I looked now upon the world as
VOL. I. N
a thing remote; which I had nothing to do with,
no expectation from, and indeed no desires about:
in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor
was ever like to have; so I thought it looked, as we
may perhaps look upon it hereafter, viz. as a place
I had lived in, but was come out of it; and well I
might say, as father Abraham to Dives, Between
me and thee there is a great gulph fixed.
In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickedness of the world here : I had neither the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of
life: I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was
now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole
manor; or, if I pleased, I might call myself king
or emperor over the whole country which I had
possession of: there were no rivals: I had no com-
petitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command
with me; I might have raised ship-loadings of corn,
but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I
thought enough for my occasion: I had tortoises, or
turtles enough; but now and then one was as much
as I could put to any use: I had timber enough to
have built a fleet of ships; I had grapes enough to
have made wine, or to have cured into raisins, to
have loaded that fleet when they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was all that was
valuable : I had enough to eat, and to supply my
wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or
the vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat,
it must be spoiled : the trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more
use of them than for fuel; and that I had no occa-
sion for, but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me, upon just reflection, that all the
good things of this world are no farther good to
us than as they are for our use: and that what-
ever we may heap up indeed to give to others, we
enjoy as much as we can use, and no more. The
most covetous griping miser in the world would
have been cured of the vice of covetousness, if he
had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no
room for desire, except it was of things which I
had not, and they were but trifles, though indeed
of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a
parcel of money, as well gold as silver, about
thirty-six pounds sterling; alas! there the nasty,
sorry, useless stuff lay; I had no manner of busi-
ness for it; and I often thought with myself, that
I would have given an handful of it for a gross of
tobacco-pipes, or for an hand-mill to grind my
corn ; nay, I would have given it all for six-penny
worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or
for an handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of
ink: as it was, I had not the least advantage by
it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in
the wet season; and if I had had the drawerfull of
diamonds, it had been the same case; and they
had been of no manner of value to me, because of
IlO LISe.
N 2
I had now brought my state of life to be much
easier in itself than it was at first, and much easier
to my mind, as well as to my body. I frequently
sat down to my meat with thankfulness, and ad-
mired the hand of God’s providence, which had
thus spread my table in the wilderness. I learned
to look more upon the bright side of my condition,
and less upon the dark side; and to consider what
I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and this
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I
cannot express them; and which I take notice of
here, to put those discontented people in mind of
it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what GoD hath
given them, because they see and covet something
that he has not given them: all our discontents
about what we want appeared to me to spring from
the want of thankfulness for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and
doubtless would be so to any one that should fall
into such distress as mine was; and this was, to
compare my present condition with what I at first
expected it should be; nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good providence of GoD
had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast
up near to the shore, where I not only could come
at her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore for my relief and comfort; without which
I had wanted tools to work, weapons for defence,
or gunpowder and shot for getting my food.
I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in
representing to myself in the most lively colours,
how I must have acted, if I had got nothing out
of the ship; how I could not have so much as got
any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it
was long before I found any of them, I must have
perished first : that H should have lived, if I had
not perished, like a mere savage: that if I had
killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had
no way to slay or open them, or part the flesh
from the skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but
must gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with my
claws, like a beast. - . .
These reflections made me very sensible of the
goodness of Providence to me, and very thankful
for my present condition, with all its hardships
and misfortunes: and this part also I cannot but
recommend to the reflection of those who are apt
in their misery to say, Is any affliction like mine?
Let them consider, how much worse the cases of
some people are, and what their case might have
been, if Providence had thought fit.
I had another reflection which assisted me also
to comfort my mind with hopes; and this was,
comparing my present condition with what I had
deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from
the hand of Providence; I had lived a dreadful
life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and fear
of God : I had been well instructed by my father
and mother; neither had they been wanting to
me in their early endeavours, to infuse a religious
awe of GoD into my mind, a sense of my duty,
and of what the nature and end of my being re-
N 3
quired of me. But, alas! falling early into the sea-
faring life, which of all the lives is the most destitute
of the fear of GoD, though his terrors are always
before them; I say, falling early into the sea-
faring life, and into seafaring company, all that
little sense of religion which I had entertained,
was laughed out of me by my messmates; by an
hardened despising of dangers, and the views of
death, which grew habitual to me; by my long
absence from all manner of opportunities to converse
with any thing but what was like myself, or to hear
any thing of what was good, or tended towards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or
of the least sense of what I was, or was to be, that
in the greatest deliverance I enjoyed, such as my
escape from Sallee, my being taken up by the
Portuguese master of the ship, my being planted
so well, in Brasil, my receiving the cargo from
England, and the like, I never once had the words
Thank God, so much as on my mind, or in my mouth;
nor in the greatest distress, had I so much thought
as to pray to him; nor so much as to say, Lord have
mercy upon me! No, not to mention the name of
GoD, unless it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
of my wicked and hardened life past; and when I
looked about me, and considered what particular
providences had attended me, since my coming
into this place, and how GoD had dealt bountifully
with me; had not only punished me less than my
iniquity deserved, but had so plentifully provided
for me; this gave me great hopes that my repen-
tance was accepted, and that GoD had yet mercies
in store for me.
With these reflections I worked my mind up,
not only to resignation to the will of God in the
present disposition of my circumstances, but even
to a sincere thankfulness of my condition; and
that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to
complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of
my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies, which
I had no reason to have expected in that place;
that I ought never more to repine at my condition,
but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that
daily bread which nothing but a cloud of wonders
could have brought: that I ought to consider I
had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as
that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay, by a long
series of miracles; and that I could hardly have
named a place in the uninhabited part of the world,
where I could have been cast more to my advan-
tage: a place where, as I had no society, which
was my affliction on one hand, so I found no ra.
venous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to
threaten my life; no venomous creatures, or poi-
sonous, which I might have fed on to my hurt; no
savages to murder and devour me.
In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one
way, so it was a life of mercy another: and I
wanted nothing to make it a life of comfort, but
to be able to make my sense of God’s goodness to
N 4
me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily
consolation; and after I made a just improvement
of these things, I went away, and was no more sad.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which I brought on shore for my help, were either
quite gone, or very much wasted, and near spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was so pale it scarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper: as
long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down
the days of the month on which any remarkable
thing happened to me; and first, by casting up
times past, I remember that there was a strange
concurrence of days, in the various providences
which befel me, and which, if I had been super-
stitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or for-
tunate, I might have had reason to have looked
upon with a great deal of curiosity. •
First, I had observed, that the same day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and
ran away to Hull in order to go to sea, the same
day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of
war, and made a slave.
The same day of the year that I escaped out of
the wreck of that ship in Yarmouth Roads, that
same day of the year afterwards I made my escape
from Sallee in the boat.
The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the
20th of September, the same day I had my life so
miraculously saved 26 years after, when I was cast
*
on shore in this island; so that my wicked life, and
solitary life, both began on a day. º
The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was
that of my bread, I mean the biscuit which I
brought out of the ship. This I had husbanded to
the last degree, allowing myself but one cake of
bread a day, for above a year: and yet I was quite
without bread for a year before I got any corn of
my own; and great reason I had to be thankful
that I had any at all, the getting it being, as has
been already observed, next to miraculous. r
My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to
linen, I had none a good while, except some che-
quered shirts which I found in the chests of the
other seamen, and which I carefully preserved,
because many times I could bear no other clothes
on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me,
that I had among all the men's clothes of the ship
almost three dozen of shirts. There were also
several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which
were left behind, but they were too hot to wear;
and though it is true, that the weather was so
violent hot that there was no need of clothes, yet
I could not go quite naked; no, though I had been
inclined to it, which I was not; nor could I abide
the thoughts of it, though I was all alone. “
One reason why I could not go quite naked,
was, I could not bear the heat of the sun so well
when quite naked, as with some clothes on ; nay,
the very heat frequently blistered myskin; whereas,
with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion,
and whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler
than without it: no more could I ever bring my-
self to go out in the heat of the sun without a cap
or an hat; the heat of the sun beating with such
violence as it does in that place, would give me
the head-ach presently, by darting so directly on
my head, without a cap or hat on, so that I could
not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat, it would
presently go away.
Upon these views I began to consider about
putting the few rags I had, which I called clothes,
into some order; I had worn out all the waistcoats
I had, and my business was now to try if I could
not make jackets out of the great watch-coats
which I had by me, and with such other materials
as I had; so I set to work a-tailoring, or rather in-
deed a-botching; for I made most piteous work
of it. However, I made shift to make two or three
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while; as for breeches or drawers, I made but very
sorry shift indeed, till afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all
the creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed
ones; and I had hung them up stretched out with
sticks in the sun; by which means some of them
were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little;
but others, it seems, were very useful. The first
thing I made of these was a great cap for my
head, with the hair on the outside to shoot off the
rain; and this I performed so well, that after this I
made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins; that
is to say, a waistcoat and breeches open at the
knees, and both loose; for they were rather wanted
to keep me cool, than to keep me warm. I must
not omit to acknowledge, that they were wretch-
edly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a
worse tailor: however, they were such as I made a
very good shift with ; and when I was abroad, if it
happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap
being outmost, I was kept very dry.
After this I spent a deal of time and pains to
make me an umbrella: I was indeed in great want
of one, and had a great mind to make one: I had
seen them made in the Brasils, where they are very
useful in the great heats which are there; and I
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater
too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I
took a world of pains at it, and was a great while
before I could make anything likely to hold; nay,
after I thought I had hit the way, I spoiled two
or three before I made one to my mind; but at
last I made one that answered indifferently well;
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let
down. I could make it to spread; but if it did
not let down too, and draw in, it would not be
portable for me any way, but just over my head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said,
I made one to answer; I covered it with skins,
the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like
a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually,
that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather,
with greater advantage than I could before in the
coolest; and when I had no need of it, I could
close it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely composed by resigning to the will of GoD,
and throwing myself wholly upon the disposal of
his Providence: this made my life better than so-
ciable; for when I began to regret the want of
conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus
conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and,
as I hope, I may say, with even my Maker, by eja-
culations and petitions, was not better than the
utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?
I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any
extraordinary thing happened to me; but I lived
on in the same course, in the same posture and
place just as before : the chief thing I was em-
ployed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my
barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of both
which I always kept up just enough to have suffi-
cient stock of the year's provisions beforehand; I
say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour
of going out with my gun, I had one labour to
make me a canoe, which at last I finished: so that
by digging a canal to it, six feet wide, and four
feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half
a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big,
as I made it without considering beforehand, as I
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it;
so never being able to bring it to the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie
where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to be
wiser next time. Indeed the next time though
I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a
place where I could not get the water to it, at any
less distance than, as I have said, of near half a
mile ; yet as I saw it was practicable at last, I never
gave it over ; and though I was near two years
about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes
of having a boat to go off to sea at last. --
However, though my little periagua was finished,
yet the size of it was not at all answerable to the
design which I had in view, when I made the first;
I mean of venturing over to the terra firma, where
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that
design, and now I thought no more of it. But as
I had a boat, my next design was to make a tour
round the island; but as I had been on the other
side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made
in that journey, made me very eager to see the
other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I
thought of nothing but sailing round the island.
For this purpose, and that I might do every
thing with discretion and consideration, I fitted
up a little mast to my boat, and made a sail to it
out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails, which
lay in store, and of which I had a great store by
Ine.
. . Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the
boat, I found she would sail very well. Then I
made little lockers and boxes at each end of my
boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammuni-
tion, &c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or
the spray of the sea; and a little long hollow place
I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could lay
my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep
it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern,
like a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the
heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and thus
I every now and then took a little voyage upon
the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the
little creek; but at last, being eager to view the
circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved
upon my tour, and accordingly I victualled my
ship for the voyage; putting in two dozen of my
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley-
bread; an earthen pot full of parched rice, a food
I eat a great deal of; a little bottle of rum, half a
goat, and powder with shot for killing more, and
two large watch-coats, of those which, as I men-
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamen’s
chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other
to cover me in the night.
It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year
of my reign, or my captivity, which you please,
that I set out on this voyage, and I found it much
longer than I expected: for though the island
itself was not very large, yet when I came to the
east side of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie
out about two leagues into the sea, some above
water, some under it; and beyond this a shoal of
sand, lying dry half a league more; so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that
point. -
When I first discovered them, I was going to
give over my enterprize, and come back again, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
sea, and above all, doubting how I should get back
again; so I came to an anchor, for I had made me
a kind of an anchor, with a piece of broken grap-
pling which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and
went on shore, climbing up an hill, which seemed
to overlook that point, where I saw the full extent
of it, and resolved to venture.
In my viewing the sea from that hill where I
stood, I perceived a strong, and indeed, a most fu-
rious current, which ran to the east, even came
close to the point; and I took the more notice of
it, because I saw there might be some danger,
that when I came into it, I might be carried out
to sea by the strength of it, and not be able to
make the island again. And indeed, had I not
gotten first upon this hill, I believe it would have
been so ; for there was the same current on the
other side of the island, only that it set it off at a
farther distance; and I saw there was a strong
eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but
to get out of the first current, and I should presently
be in an eddy. -
Ilay here, however, two days; because the wind
blowing pretty fresh (E. at S. E. and that being
just contrary to the said current) made a great
breach of the sea upon the point; so that it was
not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for
the breach, nor to go too far off because of the
Stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the sea was calm, and I ven-
tured; but I am a warning-piece again to all rash
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I come to
the point, when I was not my boat's length from
the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill. It
carried my boat along with it with such violence,
that all I could do could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it: but I found it hurried me far-
ther and farther out from the eddy, which was on
the left hand. There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all that I could do with my paddles sig-
nified nothing : and now I began to give myself
over for lost; for, as the current was on both sides
the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they
must join again, and then I was irrecoverably
gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it:
so that I had no prospect before me but of perish-
ing; not by the sea, for that was calm enough,
but of starving for hunger. I had indeed found a
tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a
great jar of fresh water, that is to say, one of my
earthen pots: but what was all this to being driven
into the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was
no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand
leagues at least!
And now I saw how easy it was for the Pro-
vidence of God to make the most miserable condi-
tion that mankind could be in worse. Now I
looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as
the most pleasant place in the world, and all the
happiness my heart could wish for, was to be there
again. I stretched out my hand to it with eager
wishes; O happy desert, said I, I shall never see
thee more | O miserable creature! said I, whither
am I going! Then I reproached myself with my
unthankful temper, and how I had repined at my
solitary condition; and now what would I give to
be on shore there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition, till it is illustrated to
us by its contraries; nor know how to value what
we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is scarce pos-
sible to imagine the consternation I was now in,
being driven from my beloved island (for so it ap-
peared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, al-
most two leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard,
till indeed my strength was almost exhausted; and
kept my boat as much to the northward, that is,
towards the side of the current which the eddy lay
on, as possibly I could ; when about noon, as the
sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little
breeze of wind in my face, springing up from the
VOL. I. o
S. S. E. This cheered my heart a little, and espe-
cially when in about half an hour more, it blew a
pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was got-
ten at a frightful distance from the island; and,
had the least cloud or hazy weather intervened, I
had been undone another way too; for I had no
compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if I had
but once lost sight of it; but the weather continu-
ing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again,
and spread my sail, standing away to the north as
much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat
began to stretch away, I saw even by the clear-
ness of the water, some alteration of the current
was near; for where the current was so strong, the
water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to
the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea
upon some rocks; these rocks I found caused the
current to part again; and as the main stress of it
ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of
the rock, and made a strong eddy, which ran back
again to the north-west with a very sharp stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be rescued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such like extremities, may guess
what my present surprise of joy was, and how
gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy ;
and the wind also freshening, how gladly I spread
my sail to it, running cheerfully before the wind,
and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the island, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at first; so
that when I came near the island, I found myself
open to the northern shore of it, that is to say,
the other end of the island, opposite to that which
I went out from. -
When I had made something more than a league
of way by the help of this current or eddy, I found
it was spent, and saved me no farther. However,
I found, that being between the two great cur-
rents, viz. that on the south side which had hur-
ried me away, and that on the north, which lay
about two leagues on the other side; I say, be-
tween these two, in the west of the island, I found
the water at least still, and running no way; and
having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on
steering directly for the island, though not making
such fresh way as I did before.
About four o'clock, in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the
point of the rocks which occasioned this distance,
stretching out as is described before, to the south-
ward, and casting off the current more southerly,
had of course made another eddy to the north;
and this I found very strong, but directly setting
the way my course lay, which was due west, but
O 2
almost full north. However, having a fresh gale,
I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west,
and in about an hour came within about a mile of
the shore: it being smooth water, I soon got to land.
When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and
gave God thanks for my deliverance, resolving to
lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my
boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I
had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a
little cove that I had espied under some trees, and
laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the
labour and fatigue of the voyage. -
I was now at a great loss which way to get home
with my boat; I had run so much hazard, and
knew too much the case, to think of attempting
it by the way I went out; and what might be at
the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I
only resolved in the morning to make my way
westward along the shore, and to see if there was
no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety,
so as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the shore, I
came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile
over, which narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet, or brook, where I found a convenient har-
bour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had
been in a little dock made on purpose for her: here
I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I
went on shore to look about me, and see where I
WàS.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the
place where I had been before when I travelled on
foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of my
boatbut my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceed-
ing hot, I began my march : the way was comfort-
able enough after such a voyage as I had been upon,
and I reached my old bower in the evening, where
I found every thing standing as I left it; for I
always kept it in good order, being, as I said be-
fore, my country-house.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell asleep: but judge you, if you can, that read
my story, what a surprise I must be in, when I
was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me
by my name several times, Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe Where are you, Ro-
bin Crusoe Where are you? Where have you
been 2
I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the first part of
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did
not awake thoroughly; and dozing between sleep-
ing and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody
spoke to me: but as the voice continued to repeat
Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe, at last I began to
awake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully
frighted, and started up in the utmost consterna-
tion: but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw
my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge, and im-
mediately knew that this was he that spoke to me;
o 3
for just in such bemoaning language I had used to
talk to him, and teach him ; and he had learned
it so perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger,
and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, Poor
Robin Crusoe, Where are you? Where have you
been 2 How came you here —and such things as I
had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the par-
rot, and that indeed it could be nobody else, it
was a good while before I could compose myself.
First, I was amazed how the creature got thither,
and then how he should just keep about the place,
and no where else : but as I was well satisfied it
could be nobody but honest Poll, I got it over;
and holding out my hand, and calling him by his
name, Poll, the sociable creature came to me, and
sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued
talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and, how did I
come here 2 and where had I been 2 just as if he
had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I car-
ried him home along with me.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for
some time, and had enough to do for many days
to sit still, and reflect upon the danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had my
boat again on my side of the island, but I knew
not how it was practicable to get it about. As to
the east-side of the island, which I had gone round,
I knew well enough there was no venturing that
way; my very heart would shrink, and my very
blood run chill, but to think of it; and to the other
side of the island, I did not know how it might be
there; but supposing the current ran with the
same force against the shore at the east, as it passed
by it on the other, I might run the same risk of
being driven down the stream, and carried by the
island, as I had been before of being carried away
from it: so with these thoughts I contented my-
self to be without any boat, though it had been
the product of so many months labour to make it,
and of so many more to get it into the sea.
In this government of my temper I remained
near a year, lived a very sedate retired life, as you
may well suppose; and my thoughts being very
much composed, as to my condition, and fully
comforted in resigning myself to the dispensations
of Providence, I thought I lived really very hap-
pily in all things except that of society.
I improved myself, in this time, in all the me-
chanic exercises which my necessities put me upon
applying myself to; and I believe could, upon oc-
casion, have made a very good carpenter, especially
considering how few tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfec-
tion in my earthen-ware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a wheel, which I found infi-
nitely easier and better, because I made things
round and shapeable, which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I never
was more vain of my own performance, or more
joyful for anything I found out, than for my being
able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a
o 4
very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and
only burnt red like other earthen-ware, yet as
it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke,
I, was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had
been always used to smoke, and there were pipes
in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing
there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards
when I searched the ship again, I could not come
at any pipes at all. :
In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and
made abundance of necessary baskets, as well as
my invention shewed me, though not very hand-
some, yet convenient for my laying things up in,
or fetching things home in. For example, if I
killed a goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree,
flay it, and dress it, and cut it in pieces, and
bring it home in a basket; and the like by a tur-
tle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a
piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for
me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave
the rest behind me: also large deep baskets were
my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry, and cured; and kept it
in great baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con-
siderably; and this was a want which it was im-
possible for me to supply: then I began seriously
to consider what I must do when I should have
no more powder; that is to say, how I should do
to kill any goats. I had, as I observed, in the
third year of my being here, kept a young kid, ..
and bred her tame; I was in hopes of getting an
he-kid, but I could not by any means bring it to
pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and I could
never find in my heart to kill her, till she died at
last of mere age. -
But being now in the eleventh year of my resi-
dence, and, as I have said, my ammunition grow-
ing low, I set myself to study some art to trap
and snare the goats, to see whether I could not
catch some of them alive; and particularly I
wanted a she-goat, great with young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them;
and believe they were more than once taken in
them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no
wire, and always found them broken, and my bait
devoured. - -
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I
had observed the goats used to feed, and over
these pits I placed hurdles of my own making too,
with a great weight upon them; and several times
I put ears of barley, and dry rice, without setting
the trap; and I could easily perceive that the goats
had gone in, and eaten up the corn, that I could
see the mark of their feet: at length, I set three
traps in one night, and going the next morning,
I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten
and gone. This was very discouraging; however,
I altered my trap; and, not to trouble you with
particulars, going one morning to see my traps, I
found in one of them a large old he-goat; and, in
one of the others, three kids, a male and two
females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him ; he was so fierce I durst not go into the pit
to him; that is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what I wanted; I could
have killed him, but that was not my business,
nor would it answer my end; so I e'en let him
out, and he ran away as if he had been frightened
out of his wits; but I did not then know what I
afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a
lion : if I had let him stay there three or four days
without food, and then have carried him some
water to drink, and then a little corn, he would
have been as tame as one of the kids; for they are
mighty sagacious, tractable creatures, where they
are well used. º
However, for the present I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to the three
kids; and taking them one by one, I tied them
with strings together; and with some difficulty
brought them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed;
but throwing them some sweet corn, it tempted
them, and they began to be tame: and now I found
that if I expected to supply myself with goat's-
flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding
some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my house like a flock of
sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me, that I
must keep the tame from the wild, or else they
would always run wild when they grew up; and
the only way for this was to have some inclosed
piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or
pale, to keep them up so effectually, that those
within might not break out, or those without
break in. -
This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands; yet as I saw there was an absolute necessity
of doing it, my first piece of work was to find out
a proper piece of ground; viz. where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for
them to drink, and cover to keep them from the
SUIIl.
Those who understand such enclosures, will
think I had very little contrivance, when I pitched
upon a place very proper for all these, being a plain
open piece of meadow-land or savanna (as our peo-
ple call it in the western colonies) which had two
or three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one
end was very woody; I say they will smile at my
forecast, when I shall tell them I began my en-
closing of this piece of ground in such a manner,
that my hedge, or pale, must have been at least
two miles about; nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass; for if it was ten miles
about, I was like to have time enough to do it in ;
but I did not consider, that my goats would be as
wild in so much compass, as if they had had the
whole island; and I should have so-much room to
chase them in, that I should never catch them.
My hedge was began and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to
me; so I presently stopped short, and for the first
beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of about
150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth,
which as it would maintain as many as I should
have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock in-
creased, I could add more ground, to my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it,
I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and
used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and
carry them some ears of barley, or an handful of
rice, and feed them out of my hand; so that after
my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose,
they would follow me up and down, bleating after
me for an handful of corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and
a half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids
and all; and in two years more I had three-and-
forty, besides several that I took and killed for
my food; and after that I enclosed five several
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens
to drive them into, to take them as I wanted them;
and gates out of one piece of ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had
goat's-flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk
too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not so much as think of, and which, when it came
into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise;
for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as Nature,
who gives supplies of food to every creature, dic-
tates even naturally how to make use of it, so I,
that never milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw
butter or cheese made, very readily and handily,
though after a great many essays and miscarriages,
made me both butter and cheese at last, and never
wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can our great Creator treat his
creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction . How
can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give
us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons!
What a table was here spread for me in a wilder-
ness, where I saw nothing at first but to perish for
hunger! -
It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen
me and my little family sit down to dinner: there
was my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at abso-
lute command; I could hang, draw, give life and
liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all
my subjects! *
Then to see how like a king I dined too, all
alone, attended by my servants' Poll, as if he had
been my favourite, as the only person permitted
to talk to me; my dog, which was now grown
very old and crazy, and found no species to mul-
tiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand;
and two cats, one on one side the table, and one on
the other, expecting now and then a bit from my
hand, as a mark of special favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my
own hands; but one of them having multiplied by
I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild
into the woods, and became indeed troublesome to
me at last; for they would often come into my
house, and plunder me too, till at last I was obliged
to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at
length they left me with this attendance, and in
this plentiful manner I lived; neither could I be
said to want any thing but society, and of that, in
some time after this, I was like to have too much.
I was something impatient, as I had observed,
to have the use of my boat, though very loth to
run any more hazard: and therefore sometimes I
sat contriving ways to get her about the island,
and at other times I sat myself down contented
enough without her. But I had a strange uneasi-
ness in my mind to go down to the point of the
island, where, as I have said in my last ramble, I
went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how
the current set, that I might see what I had to do:
this inclination increased upon me every day; and
at length I resolved to travel thither by land, and
following the edge of the shore, I did so: but had
any one in England been to meet such a man as I



was, it must either have frighted them, or raised
a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently stood
still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased
to take a sketch of my figure, as follows:
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's-
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to
keep the sun from me, as to shoot the rain off
from running into my neck; nothing being so
hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh
under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's-skin, the skirts
coming down to about the middle of my thighs:
and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same:
the breeches were made of a skin of an old he-
goat, whose hair hung down such a length on
either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the
middle of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had
none; but I had made me a pair of something, I
scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to
flap over my legs, and lace on either side like spat-
terdashes; but of a most barbarous shape, as indeed
were all the rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which
I drew together with two thongs of the same, in-
stead of buckles; and in a kind of frog on either
side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung
a little saw and a hatchet; one on one side, one
on the other: I had another belt not so broad,
and fastened in the same manner, which hung over
my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left
arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's-skin.
too; in one of which hung my powder, in the
other my shot: at my back I carried my basket,
on my shoulder my gun, and over my head a great
clumsy ugly goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after
all, was the most necessary thing I had about me,
next to my gun: as for my face, the colour of it
was really not so Mulatto like, as one might ex-
pect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. My
beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about
a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissars
and razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, ex-
cept what grew on my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I
saw at Sallee: for the Moors did not wear such,
though the Turks did. Of these mustachios, or
whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to
hang my hat upon them; but they were of length
and shape monstrous enough, and such as in Eng-
land would have passed for frightful. -
But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure,
I had so few to observe me, that it was of no
manner of consequence; so I say no more to that
part: in this kind of figure I went my new jour-
ney, and was out five or six days. I travelled first
along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I
first brought my boat to an anchor, to get up upon
the rocks; and, having no boat now to take care
of, I went over the land a nearer way, to the same
height that I was upon before; when looking for-
ward to the point of the rock which lay out, and
which I was to double with my boat, as I said
above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any
more there than in other places. . -
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to spend some time in the observing of it,
to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had oc-
casioned it: but I was presently convinced how it
was ; viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from
some great river on the shore, must be the occasion
of this current; and that according as the wind
blew more forcible from the west, or from the
north, this current came near, or went farther from
the shore; for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I
went up to the rock again, and then the tide of ebb
being made, I plainly saw the current again as
before, only that it ran farther off, being near half
a league from the shore; whereas in my case, it set
close upon the shore, and hurried me and my canoe
along with it, which at another time it would not
have done. . . - - .
This observation convinced me, that I had no-
thing to do but to observe the ebbing and the
flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring
my boat about the island again: but when I began
to think of putting it in practice, I had such a ter-
ror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the dan-
VOL. I. P
ger I had been in, that I could not think of it again
with any patience; but, on the contrary, I took
up another resolution, which was more safe, though
more laborious; and this was, that I would build,
or rather make me another periagua, or canoe; and
so have one for one side of the island, and one for
the other.
You are to understand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the island; one my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under
the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this
time I had enlarged into several apartments, or
caves, one within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had a door yet be-
yond my wall or fortification, that is to say, be-
yond where my wall joined to the rock, was all
filled up with large earthen pots, of which I have
given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen
great baskets, which would hold five or six bushels
each, where I laid up my stores of provision, espe-
cially my corn, some in the ear cut off short from
the straw, and the other rubbed out with my
hands.
As for my wall, made as before, with long stakes
or piles, those piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown so big, and spread so very much,
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's
view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my
two pieces of corn ground; which I kept duly
cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me
their harvest in its season: and whenever I had
occasion for more corn, I had more land adjoining
as fit as that.
Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there also ; for first, I
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept
in repair; that is to say, I kept the hedge which
circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual
height, the ladder standing always in the inside; I
kept the trees, which at first were no more than
my stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall;
I kept them always so cut, that they might spread
and grow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always
standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles
set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made me a squab or couch, with the skins of the
creatures I had killed, and with other soft things,
and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to
our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and a great
watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever I had
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up
my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my
cattle, that is to say, my goats: and as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose
this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept entire,
lest the goats should break through, that I never
P 2
left off, till with infinite labour I had stuck the out-
side of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near
to one another, that it was rather a pale than an
hedge, and there was scarce room to put an hand
through between them, which afterwards, when
those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy
season, made the enclosure strong, like a wall, in-
deed stronger than any wall. .
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support;
for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame
creatures thus at my hand, would be a living maga-
zine of flesh, milk, butter and cheese, for me, as
long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty
years; and that keeping them in my reach, de-
pended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures
to such a degree, that I might be sure of keeping
them together; which by this method indeed I so
effectually secured, that when these little stakes
began to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I
was forced to pull some of them up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter store of
raisins, and which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of
my whole diet; and indeed they were not only
agreeable, but physical, wholesome, nourishing,
and refreshing to the last degree. -
As this was also about half way between my
other habitation and the place where I had laid up
my boat, I generally staid and lay here in my way
thither; for I used frequently to visit my boat, and
I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert
myself, but no more hazardous voyages would Igo,
nor scarce ever above a stone's cast or two from the
shore, I was so apprehensive of being hurried out
of my knowledge again by the currents, or winds,
or any other accident. But now I come to a new
scene of my life. -
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the
print of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which
was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like
one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition.
I listened, I looked round me, I could hear nothing,
nor see anything; I went up to a rising ground to
look farther. I went up the shore, and down the
shore, but it was all one, I could see no other im-
pression but that one. I went to it again to see if
there were any more, and to observe if it might not
be my fancy, but there was no room for that, for
there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel,
and every part of a foot: how it came thither I
knew not, nor could in the least imagine. But
after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man
perfectly confused, and out of myself, I came home
to my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground
I went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking
behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking
every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at
P 3
a distance to be a man; nor is it possible to de-
scribe how many various shapes an affrighted ima-
gination represented things to me in ; how many
wild ideas were formed every moment in my fancy,
and what strange unaccountable whimsies came
into my thoughts by the way.
When I came to my castle, for so I think I called
it ever after this, I fled into it like one pursued;
whether I went over by the ladder, as first contriv.
ed, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I
called a door, I cannot remember; for never
frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with
more terror of mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night: the farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my apprehen-
sions were; which is something contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially to the usual
practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so em-
barrassed with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to
myself, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil; and
reason joined in with me upon this supposition.
For how should any other thing in human shape
come into the place 2 Where was the vessel that
brought them 2 What marks were there of any
other footsteps? And how was it possible a man
should come there 2 But then to think that Satan
should take human shape upcn him in such a place,
where there could be no manner of occasion for it,
but to leave the print of his foot behind him, and
that even for no purpose too (for he could not be
sure I should see it), this was an amazement the
other way. I considered that the devil might have
found out abundance of other ways to have ter-
rified me, than this of the single print of a foot.
That as I lived quite on the other side of the island,
he would never have been so simple to leave a
mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one
whether I should ever see it or not ; and in the
sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon an
high wind would have defaced entirely. All this
seemed inconsistent with the thing itself, and with
all notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of
the devil.
Abundance of such things as these assisted to
argue me out of all apprehensions of its being the
devil. And I presently concluded that it must be
some more dangerous creature; viz. That it must
be some of the savages of the main land over against
me, who had wandered out to sea in their canoes,
and, either driven by the currents, or by contrary
winds, had made the island; and had been on shore,
but were gone away again to sea, being as loth,
perhaps, to have staid in this desolate island, as I
would have been to have had them.
While these reflections were rolling upon my
mind, I was very thankful in my thought, that I
was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time,
or that they did not see my boat, by which they
would have concluded, that some inhabitants had
been in the place, and perhaps have searched far-
P 4
ther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked my
imaginations about their having found my boat,
and that there were people here; and that if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater
numbers, and devour me; that if it should happen
so that they should not find me, yet they would
find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away
all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at
last for mere want. -
Thus my fear banished all my religious hope: all
that former confidence in GoD which was founded
upon such wonderful experience as I had had of
his goodness, now vanished; as if he that had fed
me by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
power the provision which he had made for me by
his goodness. I reproached myself with my uneasi-
ness, that I would not sow any more corn one year,
than would just serve me till the next season, as if
no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying
the crop that was upon the ground. And this I
thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
future to have two or three years corn before-hand,
so that whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread. -
How strange a chequer-work of Providence is
the life of man And by what secret differing
springs are the affections hurried about, as differ-
ing circumstances present! To-day we love what
to-morrow we hate; to-day we seek what to-mor-
row we shun ; to-day we desire what to-morrow we
fear, nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of
This was exemplified in me at this time, in the most
lively manner imaginable; for I, whose only afflic-
tion was, that I seemed banished from human
society, that I was alone, circumscribed by the
boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and con-
demned to what I call a silent life; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be num-
bered among the living, or to appear among the
rest of his creatures; that to have seen one of my
own species, could have seemed to me a raising me
from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of sal-
vation, could bestow; I say, that I should now
tremble at the very apprehensions of seeing a man,
and was ready to sink into the ground, at but the
shadow, or silent appearance of a man's having set
his foot on the island
Such is the uneven state of human life; and it
afforded me a great many curious speculations
afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first
surprise. I considered that this was the station of
life the infinitely wise and good providence of GoD
had determined for me; that as I could not fore-
see what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all
this, so I was not to dispute his sovereignty, who,
as I was his creature, had an undoubted right, by
creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely
as he thought fit; and who, as I was a creature
who had offended him, had likewise a judicial
right to condemn me to what punishment he
thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to
bear his indignation, because I had sinned against
him.
I then reflected that GoD, who was not only
righteous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit
thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to de-
liver me; that if he did not think fit to do it, it
was my unquestioned duty to resign myself abso-
lutely and entirely to his will. And, on the other
hand, it was my duty also to hope in him, pray to
him, and quietly to attend the dictates and direc-
tions of his daily providence.
These thoughts took me up many hours, days,
nay, I may say, weeks and months; and one par-
ticular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I
cannot omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my
bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of Savages, I found it discomposed
me very much; upon which those words of the
scripture came into my thoughts, “Call upon me
in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify me.”
Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earnestly to GoD for deli-
verance. When I had done praying, I took up my
bible, and opening it to read, the first words that
presented to me, were, “Wait on the Lord, and be
of good cheer, and he shall strengthen thy heart:
wait, I say, on the Lord.” It is impossible to ex-
press the comfort this gave me; and in return, I
thankfully laid down the book, and was no more
sad; at least, not on that occasion.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehen-
sions, and reflections, it came into my thoughts
one day, that all this might be a mere chimera of
my own, and that this foot might be the print of
my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat.
This cheered me up a little too, and I began to
persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was
nothing else but my own foot; and why might not
I come that way from the boat as well as I was
going that way to the boat? Again, I considered
also, that I could by no means tell for certain
where I had trod, and where I had not; and that,
if at last this was only the print of my own foot,
I had played the part of those fools, who strive to
make stories of spectres and apparitions, and then
are themselves frighted at them more than any
body else.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep
abroad again; for I had not stirred out of my
castle for three days and nights, so that I began to
starve for provision; for I had little or nothing
within doors, but some barley-cakes and water.
Then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked
too, which usually was my evening diversion; and
the poor creatures were in great pain and incon-
venience for want of it; and indeed it almost
spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their
milk.
Heartening myself therefore with the belief,
that this was nothing but the print of one of my
own feet, (and so I might be truly said to start at
my own shadow,) I began to go abroad again, and
went to my country-house to milk my flock; but
to see with what fear I went forward, how often I
looked behind me, how I was ready, every now-
and-then, to lay down my basket, and run for my
life; it would have made any one have thought I
was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had
been lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed
I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three
days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a
little bolder, and to think there was really nothing
in it but my own imagination; but I could not per-
suade myself fully of this, till I should go down
to the shore again, and see this print of a foot,
and measure it by my own, and see if there was
any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured
it was my own foot. But when I came to the
place first, it appeared evidently to me, that when
I laid up my boat, I could not possibly be on shore
any where thereabouts. Secondly, when I came
to measure the mark with my own foot, I found
my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these
things filled my head with new imaginations, and
gave me the vapours again to the highest degree;
so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague, and
I went home again, filled with the belief that some
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short,
that the island was inhabited, and I might be sur-
prised before I was aware; and what course to take
for my security, I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolutions men take, when
possessed with fear! It deprives them of the use of
those means which reason offers for their relief.
The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw
down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle
wild into the woods, that the enemy might not find
them, and then frequent the island in prospect of
the same, or the like booty; then to the simple thing
of digging up my two corn-fields, that they might
not find such a grain there, and still to be prompted
to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower
and tent, that they might not see any vestiges of
my habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in
order to find out the persons inhabiting. º
These were the subjects of the first night's cogi-
tation, after I was come home again, while the ap-
prehensions which had so over-run my mind were
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours,
as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand
times more terrifying than danger itself, when ap-
parent to the eyes; and we find the burden of
anxiety greater by much than the evil which we
are anxious about; but, which was worse than all
this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the
resignation I used to practise that I hoped to have.
I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained
not only, that the Philistines were upon him, but
that GoD had forsaken him; for I did not now
take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to
GoD in my distress, and resting upon his provi-
dence, as I had done before, for my defence and
deliverance; which if I had done, I had at least
been more cheerfully supported under this new
surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more
resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking
all night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and
having by the amusement of my mind been, as it
were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very
soundly, and awaked much better composed than
I had ever been before. And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon the utmost debate with my-
self, I concluded, that this island, which was so
exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from
the main land than as I had seen, was not so en-
tirely abandoned as I might imagine. That al-
though there were no stated inhabitants who lived
on the spot; yet that there might sometimes come
boats off from the shore, who either with design, or
perhaps never but when they were driven by cross
winds, might come to this place.
That I had lived here fifteen years now, and had
not met with the least shadow or figure of any
people before; and that if at any time they should
be driven here, it was probable they went away
again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had
never thought fit to fix there upon any occasion, to
this time.
That the most I could suggest any danger from,
was, from any such casual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against
their wills; so they made no stay here, but went
off again with all possible speed, seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not have the help
of the tides and day-light back again; and that
therefore I had nothing to do but to consider of
some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages
land upon the spot. -
Now I begun sorely to repent that I had dug
my cave so large, as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely
considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me
a second fortification, in the manner of a semi-
circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had
planted a double row of trees about twelve years
before, of which I made mention: these trees hav-
ing been planted so thick before, there wanted but
a few piles to be driven between them, that they
should be thicker and stronger, and my wall would
be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old
cables, and every thing I could think of to make
it strong; having in it seven little holes, about as
big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside
of this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick,
continually bringing earth out of my cave, and
laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking upon
it; and through the seven holes I contrived to
plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I
got seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say,
I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into
frames that held them like a carriage, that so I
could fire all the seven guns in two minutes time:
this wall I was many a weary month in finishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all the ground
without my wall, for a great way every way, as
full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,
which I found so apt to grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large
space between them and my wall, that I might
have room to see an enemy, and they might have
no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer wall. - -
Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and
in five or six years time I had a wood before my
dwelling, grown so monstrous thick and strong,
that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no
man of what kind soever would ever imagine that
there was any thing beyond it, much less an habi-
tation : as for the way I proposed myself to go in
and out (for I left no avenue) it was by setting
two ladders; one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, and left room to place an-
other ladder upon that; so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living could come down
to me without mischiefing himself; and if they had
come down, they were still on the outside of m
outer wall. - -
Thus I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation; and it will
be seen at length, that they were not altogether
without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at
that time more than my mere fear suggested.
While this was doing, I was not altogether care.
less of my other affairs; for I had a great concern
upon me for my little herd of goats; they were not
only a present supply to me upon every occasion,
and began to be sufficient for me, without the ex-
pence of powder and shot, but also abated the
fatigue of my hunting after the wild ones; and I
was loth to lose the advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurse up over again.
To this purpose, after long consideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them: one was
to find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and
the other was to enclose two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half
a dozen young goats in each place; so that if any
disaster happened to the flock in general, I might
be able to raise them again with little trouble and
time: and this, though it would require a great
deal of time and labour, I thought was the most
rational design. . . .
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched
upon one, which was as private indeed as my heart
could wish; for it was a little damp piece of ground
in the middle of the hollow and thick woods,
VOL. I. Q
where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once
before, endeavouring to come back that way from
the eastern part of the island: here I found a clear
piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with
woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature;
at least it did not want near so much labour to
make it so, as the other pieces of ground I had
worked so hard at. -
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground, and in less than a month’s time I had so
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you please, which were not so wild now as at first
they might be supposed to be, were well enough
secured in it. So without any farther delay, I
removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to this
piece; and when there, I continued to perfect the
fence, till I had made it as secure as the other,
which, however, I did at more leisure, and it took
me up more time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expence of, purely
from my apprehensions on the account of the
print of a man's foot which I had seen; for as yet,
I never saw any human creature come near the
island; and I had now lived two years under these
uneasinesses, which indeed made my life much
less comfortable than it was before; as may well
be imagined, by any who know what it is to
live in the constant snare of the fear of man : and
this I must observe with grief too, that the dis-
composure of my mind had too great impressions
also upon the religious part of my thoughts; for
the dread and terror of falling into the hands of
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I
seldom found myself in a due temper for applica-
tion to my Maker; at least, not with the sedate
calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont
to do. I rather prayed to GoD as under great
affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded with
danger, and in expectation every night of being
murdered and devoured before the morning; and I
must testify from my experience, that a temper of
peace, thankfulness, love and affection, is much
more the proper frame for prayer than that of ter-
ror and discomposure; and that under the dread of
mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a
comforting performance of the duty of praying to
GoD, than he is for repentance on a sick-bed; for
these discomposures affect the mind as the others do
the body; and the discomposure of the mind must
necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body,
and much greater, praying to GoD being properly
an act of the mind, not of the body.
But to go on; after I had thus secured one part
of my little living stock, I went about the whole
island, searching for another private place, to make
such another deposit; when wandering more to the
west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon
the sea at a great distance. I had found a per-
spective glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests,
which I saved out of our ship; but I had it not
about me; and this was so remote, that I could
Q 2
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it
till my eyes were not able to look any longer: whe-
ther it was a boat, or not, I do not know; but as I
descended from the hill, I could see no more of it, so
I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more with-
out a perspective glass in my pocket. :
When I was come down the hill, to the end of
the island, where indeed I had never been before,
I was presently convinced, that the seeing the
print of a man's foot, was not such a strange thing
in the island as I imagined; and, but that it was a
special Providence that I was cast upon the side
of the island where the savages never came, I
should easily have known, that nothing was more
frequent than for the canoes from the main, when
they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to
shoot over to that side of the island for harbour;
likewise, as they often met and fought in their
canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, ac-
cording to their dreadful customs, being all can-
nibals, they would kill and eat them : of which
hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as
I said above, being the S. W. point of the island,
I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind,
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet,
and other bones of human bodies; and particularly
I observed a place where there had been a fire
made, and a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit,
where it is supposed the savage wretches had sat
down to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of
their fellow-creatures.
I was so astonished with the sight of these
things, that I entertained no notions of any dan-
ger to myself from it for a long while ; all my ap-
prehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a
pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror
of the degeneracy of human nature; which, though
I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a
view of before : in short, I turned away my face
from the horrid spectacle, my stomach grew sick,
and I was just at the point of fainting, when na-
ture discharged the disorder from my stomach,
and, having vomited with an uncommon violence,
I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in
the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again
with all the speed I could, and walked on towards
my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the
island, I stood still awhile as amazed; and then
recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost af.
fection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my
eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in
a part of the world where I was distinguished from
such dreadful creatures as these ; and that though
I had esteemed my present condition very mise-
rable, had yet given me so many comforts in it, that
I had still more to give thanks for than to com-
plain of; and this above all, that I had, even in
this miserable condition, been comforted with the
Q 3
knowledge of himself, and the hope of his blessing,
which was a felicity more than sufficiently equi-
valent to all the misery which I had suffered or
could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness I went home to
my castle, and began to be much easier now, as to
the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was
before; for I observed, that these wretches never
came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not ex-
pecting any thing here; and having often, no
doubt, been up in the covered woody part of it,
without finding any thing to their purpose. I
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footsteps of a human crea-
ture there before; and might be here eighteen
more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did
not discover myself to them, which I had no man-
ner of occasion to do, it being my only business to
keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless
I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to
make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the sa-
vage wretches that I have been speaking of, and of
the wretched inhuman custom of their devouring
and eating one another up, that I continued pensive
and sad, and kept close within my own circle for
almost two years after this: when I say my own
circle, I mean by it my three plantations, viz. my
castle, my country-seat, which I called my bower,
and my enclosure in the woods; nor did I look after
this for any other use than as an enclosure for my
goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to
these hellish wretches was such, that I was as fear-
ful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself;
nor did I so much as go to look after my boat in
all this time, but began rather to think of making
me another; for I could not think of ever making
any more attempts to bring the other boat round the
island to me, lest I should meet with some of those
creatures at sea, in which, if I had happened to
have fallen into their hands, I knew what would
have been my lot.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that
I was in no danger of being discovered by these
people, began to wear off my uneasiness about
them ; and I began to live just in the same com-
posed manner as before; only with this difference,
that I used more caution, and kept my eyes more
about me than I did before, lest I should happen
to be seen by any of them ; and particularly, I
was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of
them on the island should happen to hear it; and
it was therefore a very good providence to me,
that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of
goats, that I had no need to hunt any more about
the woods, or shoot at them ; and if I did catch
any more of them after this, it was with traps and
snares, as I had done before : so that for two years
after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it; and, which
was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the
Q 4
ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least
two of them, sticking them in my goat-skin belt.
I likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses
that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to
put it in also ; so that I was now a most formida-
ble fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you
add to the former description of myself, the par-
ticular of two pistols, and a great broad-sword
hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scab-
bard.
Things going on thus, as I have said, for some
time, I seemed, excepting these cautions, to be re-
duced to my former calm sedate way of living;
all these things tended to shew me more and more
how far my condition was from being miserable,
compared to some others; nay, to many other par-
ticulars of life, which it might have pleased God
to have made my lot. It put me upon reflecting,
how little repining there would be among man-
kind, at any condition of life, if people would ra.
ther compare their condition with those that are
worse, in order to be thankful, than be always
comparing them with those which are better, to
assist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my
own preservation, had taken off the edge of my
invention for my own conveniences; and I had
dropt a good design, which I had once bent my
thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I could not
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer: this was really a whim-
sical thought, and I reproved myself often for the
simplicity of it; for I presently saw there would be
the want of several things necessary to the making
my beer, that it would be impossible for me to sup-
ply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was
a thing that, as I have observed already, I could
never compass; no, though I spent not many days,
but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but to
no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to
make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper
or kettle to make it boil; and yet, had not all
these things intervened, I mean the frights and
terrors I was in about the savages, I had under-
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I
seldom gave any thing over without accomplishing
it, when I once had it in my head enough to begin
it. -
But my invention now ran quite another way;
for night and day I could think of nothing but
how I might destroy some of these monsters in
their cruel bloody entertainment, and if possible,
save the victim they should bring hither to destroy.
It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be, to set down all the con-
trivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my
thoughts, for the destroying these creatures, or at
least frightening them, so as to prevent their com-
ing hither any more; but all was abortive; nothing
could be possible to take effect, unless I was to be
there to do it myself; and what could one man
do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts,
or their bows and arrows, with which they could
shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun ?
Sometimes I contrived to dig an hole under the
place where they made their fire, and put in five
or six pounds of gunpowder, which when they
kindled their fire, would consequently take fire,
and blow up all that was near it; but, as in the
first place I should be very loth to waste so much
powder upon them, my store being now within the
quantity of a barrel, so neither could I be sure of
its going off at any certain time, when it might
surprise them ; and, at best, that it would do little
more than just blow the fire about their ears, and
fright them, but not sufficient to make them for-
sake the place; so I laid it aside, and then pro-
posed, that I would place myself in ambush, in
some convenient place, with my three guns all
double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody
ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure
to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every
shot; and then falling in upon them with my three
pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that,
if there were twenty, I should kill them all : this
fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and I
was so full of it that I often dreamt of it; and
sometimes, that I was just going to let fly at them
in my sleep.
I went so far with it in my indignation, that I
employed myself several days to find out proper
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to
watch for them; and I went frequently to the
place itself, which was now grown more familiar
to me; and especially while my mind was thus
filled with thoughts of revenge, and of a bloody
putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as
I may call it; but the horror I had at the place,
and at the signals of the barbarous wretches de-
vouring one another, abated my malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the side of
the hill, where I was satisfied I might securely
wait till I saw any of the boats coming, and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on
shore, convey myself unseen into thickets of trees,
in one of which there was an hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely; and where I might sit,
and observe all their bloody doings, and take my
full aim at their heads, when they were so close
together, as that it would be next to impossible
that I should miss my shoot, or that I could fail
wounding three or four of them at the first shoot.
In this place then I resolved to fix my design;
and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my
ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded
with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol-bullets, and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near an handful of
swan-shot of the largest size; I also loaded my
pistols with about four bullets each ; and in this
posture, well provided with ammunition for a
second and third charge, I prepared myself for my
expedition.
. After I had thus laid the scheme for my design,
and in my imagination put it in practice, I conti-
nually made my tour every morning up to the top
of the hill, which was from my castle, as I called
it, about three miles or more, to see if I could ob-
serve any boats upon the sea, coming near the
island, or standing over towards it; but I began
to tire of this hard duty, after I had for two or
three months constantly kept my watch; but came
always back without any discovery, there having
not in all that time been the least appearance, not
only on or near the shore, but not on the whole
ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
every way. - * * * * . " , , , ;
As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look out, so long also I kept up the vigour of my
design, and my spirits seemed to be all the while
in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution,
as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for
an offence, which I had not at all entered into a
discussion of in my thoughts, any further than my
passions were at first fired by the horror I con-
ceived at the unnatural custom of the people of
that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by
Providence, in his wise disposition of the world,
to have no other guide than that of their own abo-
minable and vitiated passions; and consequently
were left, and perhaps had been for some ages, to
act such horrid things, and receive such dreadful
cusoms, as nothing but nature, entirely abandoned
of Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degene-
racy, could have run them into; but now, when,
as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless
excursion which I had made so long, and so far,
every morning in vain; so my opinion of the
action itself began to alter, and I began, with
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it
was I was going to engage in ; what authority or
call I had to pretend to be judge and executioner
upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had
thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished,
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners
of his judgments upon one another; also, how far
these people were offenders against me, and what
OF, ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237
which they shed promiscuously one upon another.
I debated this very often with myself thus : How
do I know what God himself judges in this parti-
cular case ? It is certain these people do not com-
mit this as a crime; it is not against their own
consciences reproving, or their light reproaching
them. They do not know it to be an offence, and
then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we
do in almost all the sins we commit. They think
it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war,
than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat hnman flesh,
than we do to eat mutton.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong in
it; that these people were not murderers in the
sense that I had before condemned them in my
thoughts, any more than those Christians were
murderers, who often put to death the prisoners
taken in battle, or more frequently, upon many
occasions, put whole troops of men to the sword,
without giving quarter, though they threw down
their arms and submitted.
In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit
the usage they gave one another was thus brutish
and inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me:
these people had done me no injury: that if they
attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my imme-
diate preservation to fall upon them, something
might be said for it; but that I was yet out of
their power, and they had really no knowledge of
me, and consequently no design upon me; and
therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon
them : that this would justify the conduct of
the Spaniards, in all their barbarities practised in
America, where they destroyed millions of these
people, who, however they were idolaters and bar-
barians, and had several bloody and barbarous
rites in these customs, such as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent people; and that the rooting them
out of the country is spoken of with the utmost
abhorrence and detestation, even by the Spaniards
themselves, at this time, and by all other Christian
nations of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody
and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either
to GoD or man ; and such, as for which the very
name of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and
terrible to all people of humanity, or of Christian
compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were par.
ticularly eminent for the product of a race of men,
who were without principles of tenderness, or the
common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is
reckoned to be a mark of a generous temper in
the mind.
These considerations really put me to a pause,
and to a kind of a full stop ; and I began by little
and little to be off of my design, and to conclude
I had taken a wrong measure in my resolutions to
attack the savages; that it was not my business
to meddle with them, unless they first attacked
me, and this it was my business, if possible, to pre-
vent; but that, if I were discovered and attacked,
then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myself, that
this really was the way, not to deliver myself, but
entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I
was sure to kill every one that not only should be
on shore at that time, but that should ever come
on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped
to tell their country-people what had happened,
they would come over again by thousands to re-
venge the death of their fellows; and I should
only bring upon myself a certain destruction,
which at present I had no manner of occasion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in
principles nor in policy, I ought one way or other
to concern myself in this affair: that my business
was by all possible means to conceal myself from
them, and not to leave the least signal to them to
guess by, that there were any living creatures upon
the island, I mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I
was convinced now many ways that I was perfectly
out of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody
schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures,
I mean innocent as to me; as to the crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them; they were national punishments
to make a just retribution for national offences;
and to bring public judgments upon those who
offend in a public manner, by such ways as best
please GoD.
This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater satisfaction to me, than that I had
not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw
so much reason to believe would have been no less
... a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had com.
mitted it; and I gave most humble thanks on my
knees to GoD, that had thus delivered me from
blood-guiltiness; beseeching him to grant me the
protection of his Providence, that I might not fall
into the hands of barbarians; or that I might not
lay my hands upon them, unless I had a more
clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my
own life.
In this disposition I continued for near a year
after this: and so far was I from desiring an occa-
sion for falling upon these wretches, that in all
that time I never once went up the hill to see
whether there were any of them in sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on shore
there or not; that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my contrivances against them, or be
provoked, by any advantage which might present
itself, to fall upon them; only this I did, I went
and removed my boat, which I had on the other
side of the island, and carried it down to the east
end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little
cove which I found under some high rocks, and
where I knew, by reason of the currents, the sa-
vages durst not, at least would not, come with
their boats, upon any account whatsoever.
With my boat I carried away every thing that
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne-
cessary for the bare going thither; viz. a mast
and sail, which I had made for her, and a thing
like an anchor, but indeed, which could not be
called either anchor or grappling: however, it was
the best I could make of its kind. All these I re-
moved, that there might not be the least shadow
of any discovery, or any appearance of any boat,
or of any habitation upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more re-
tired than ever, and seldom went from my cell,
other than upon my constant employment, viz. to
milk my she-goats, and manage my little flock in
the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part
of the island, was quite out of danger: for certain
VOL. I. R
it is, that these savage people, who sometimes
haunted this island, never came with any thoughts
of finding any thing here, and consequently never
wandered off from the coast; and I doubt not but
they might have been several times on shore, after
my apprehensions of them had made me cautious,
as well as before; and indeed I looked back with
some horror upon the thoughts of what my condi-
tion would have been, if I had chopped upon them,
and been discovered before that, when naked and
unarmed, except with one gun, and that loaded
often only with small shot. I walked every where
peeping and peering about the island, to see what
I could get: what a surprise should I have been
in, if, when I discovered the print of a man's foot,
I had instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages,
and found them pursuing me, and, by the swift-
ness of their running, no possibility of my escap-
ing them!
The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very
soul within me, and distressed my mind so much,
that I could not soon recover it; to think what I
should have done, and how I not only should not
have been able to resist them, but even should not
have had presence of mind enough to do what I
might have done ; much less what now, after so
much consideration and preparation, I might be
able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of
these things, I would be very melancholy, and
sometimes it would last a great while; but I re-
solved it at last all into thankfulness to that Pro-
*Tºº Hºº Fºr ... .

vidence which had delivered me from so many un-
seen dangers, and had kept me from those mis-
chiefs, which I could no way have been the agent
in delivering myself from ; because I had not the
least notion of any such thing depending, or the
least supposition of its being possible. -
This renewed a contemplation, which often had
come to my thoughts in former time, when first I
began to see the merciful dispositions of Heaven,
in the dangers we run through in this life; how
wonderfully we are delivered when we know no-
thing of it: how, when we are in a quandary (as
we call it), a doubt or hesitation, whether to go
this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us
this way, when we intended to go another way;
nay, when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps
business, has called to go the other way, yet a
strange impression upon the mind, from we know
not what springs, and by we know not what power,
shall over-rule us to go this way; and it shall af.
terwards appear, that had we gone that way which
we would have gone, and even to our imagination
ought to have gone, we should have been ruined
and lost. Upon these, and many like reflections, I
afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that
whenever I found those secret hints, or pressings
of my mind, to doing or not doing any thing that
presented, or to going this way or that way, I
never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I
knew no other reason for it, than that such a pres-
R 2
sure, or such an hint, hung upon my mind. I
could give many examples of the success of this
conduct in the course of my life; but more espe-
cially in the latter part of my inhabiting this un-
happy island; besides many occasions which it is
very likely I might have taken notice of, if I had
seen with the same eyes then that I saw with now.
But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot
but advise all considering men, whose lives are at-
tended with such extraordinary incidents as mine,
or even though not so extraordinary, not to slight
such secret intimations of Providence, let them
come from what invisible intelligence they will.
That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot ac-
count for; but certainly they are a proof of the
converse of spirits, and the secret communication
between those embodied and those unembodied;
and such a proof as can never be withstood; of
which I shall have occasion to give some very re-
markable instances, in the remainder of my soli-
tary residence in this dismal place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it
strange, if I confess that these anxieties, these
constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that
was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and
to all the contrivances that I had laid for my fu-
ture accommodations and conveniences. I had
the care of my safety more now upon my hands
than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail,
or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I
should make should be heard; much less would I
fire a gun, for the same reason; and above all, I
was very, uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the
day, should betray me: and for this reason I re-
moved that part of my business which required
fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c. into
my new apartment in the wood; where, after I
had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable
consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth,
which went in a vast way, and where, I dare say,
no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would
be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would any
man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so
much as a safe retreat. -
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of
a great rock, where by mere accident (I would
say, if I did not see an abundant reason to ascribe
all such things now to Providence), I was cut-
ting down some thick branches of trees to make
charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe the
reason of my making this charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habi-
tation, as I said before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my bread, cooking my meat,
&c. so I contrived to burn some wood here, as I
had seen done in England, under turf, till it became
chark, or dry coal; and then putting the fire out,
I preserved the coal to carry home, and perform
the other services which fire was wanting for at
home, without any danger of smoke. -
But this by the bye. While I was cutting down
R 3
some wood here, I perceived that behind a very
thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there
was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to look
into it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth
of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say,
sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and per-
haps another with me; but I must confess to you,
I made more haste out than I did in ; when look-
ing farther into the place, which was perfectly
dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some crea-
ture, whether devil or man I knew not, which
twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the
cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the
reflection.
However, after some pause, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to see the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone,
and that I durst to believe there was nothing in
this cave that was more frightful than myself:
upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a
large firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the
stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three
steps in, but I was almost as much frightened as
I was before; for I heard a very loud sigh, like
that of a man in some pain; and it was followed
by a broken noise, as if of words half-expressed,
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and
was indeed struck with such a surprise, that it put
me into a cold sweat; and if I had had an hat on
my head, I will not answer for it that my hair
?

might not have lifted it off. But still, plucking
up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging
myself a little, with considering that the power
and presence of GoD was every-where, and was
able to protect me; upon this I stepped forward
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it
up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground
a most monstrous frightful old he-goat, just making
his will, as we say, gasping for life, and dying
indeed of mere old age. -
I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out,
and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise
himself; and I thought with myself, he might even
lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them
should be so hardy as to come in there, while he
had any life in him. * º
I was now recovered from my surprize, and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the cave was
but very small; that is to say, it might be about
twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, either
round or square, no hands ever having been em-
ployed in making it but those of mere nature. I
observed also, that there was a place at the farther
side of it that went in farther, but so low, that it
required me to creep upon my hands and knees
to get into it, and whither it went, I knew not ; so
having no candle, I gave it over for some time,
but resolved to come again the next day, provided
with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made
of the lock of one of the musquets, with some wild-
fire in the pan.
R 4
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided
with six large candles of my own making (for I
made very good candles now of goats tallow); and
going into this low place, I was obliged to creep
upon all fours, as I have said, almost ten yards;
which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold
enough, considering that I knew not how far it
might go, or what was beyond it. When I was
got through the streight, I found the roof rose
higher up, I believe nea, twenty feet; but never
was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I dare
say, as it was, to look round the sides and roof of
this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred
thousand lights to me from my two candles: what
it was in the rock, whether diamonds, or any other
precious stones, or gold, which I rather suppose it
to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a most delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and
had a sort of small loose gravel upon it; so that
there was no nauseous creature to be seen; nei-
ther was there any damp or wet on the sides of
the roof; the only difficulty in it was the en-
trance, which, however, as it was a place of secu-
rity, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought
that was a convenience; so that I was really re-
joiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any
delay, to bring some of those things which I was
most anxious about to this place; particularly, I
resolved to bring hither my magazine of powder,
and all my spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces (for
I had three in all) and three musquets (for of them
I had eight in all); so I kept at my castle only five,
which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon,
on my outmost fence, and were ready also to take
out upon any expedition.
Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition,
I was obliged to open the barrel of powder which
I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet;
and I found that the water had penetrated about
three or four inches into the powder on every side,
which, caking and growing hard, had preserved
the inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had
near sixty pounds of very good powder in the centre
of the cask; and this was an agreeable discovery
to me at that time; so I carried all away thither,
never keeping above two or three pounds of powder
with me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any
kind. I also carried thither all the lead I had left
for the bullets.
I fancied myself now like one of the ancient
giants, which were said to live in caves and holes in
the rock, where none could come at them; for I
persuaded myself while I was here, if five hundred
savages were to hunt me, they could never find me
out; or if they did, they would not venture to
attack me here. -
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in
the mouth of the cave the next day after I made
this discovery; and I found it much easier to dig
a great hole there, and throw him in, and cover him
with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him
there, to prevent offence to my nose. -
I was now in my twenty-third year of residence
in this island, and was so naturalized to the place,
and to the manner of living, that could I have but
enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come
to the place to disturb me, I could have been con-
tent to have capitulated for spending the rest of
my time there, even to the last moment, till I had
laid me down and died, like the old goat in the
cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions
and amusements, which made the time pass more
pleasantly with me a great deal than it did before;
as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted before,
to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked
so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant
to me; and he lived with me no less than six-and-
twenty years: how long he might live afterwards
I knew not; though I know they have a notion in
the Brasils, that they live an hundred years; per-
haps some of my Polls may be alive there still, call-
ing after poor Robin Crusoe to this day; I wish
no Englishman the ill luck to come there and hear
them; but if he did, he would certainly believe it
was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and
loving companion to me for no less than sixteen
years of my time, and then died of mere old age;
as for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed,
to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several
of them at first, to keep them from devouring me
and all I had ; but at length, when the two old ones
I brought with me were gone, and after some time
continually driving them from me, and letting
them have no provision with me, they all ran wild
into the woods, except two or three favourites,
which I kept tame, and whose young, when they
had any, I always drowned, and these were part of
my family. Besides these, I always kept two or
three household kids about me, which I taught to
feed out of my hand; and I had also more parrots
which talked pretty well, and would all call Robin
Crusoe, but none like my first; nor, indeed, did I
take the pains with any of them that I had done
with him. I had also several tame sea fowls, whose
names I know not, which I caught upon the shore,
and cut their wings; and the little stakes, which I
had planted before my castle wall, being now grown
up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived
among these low trees, and bred there, which was
very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above, I
began to be very well contented with the life I led,
if it might but have been secured from the dread
of savages. - -
But it was otherwise directed; and it might not
be amiss for all people who shall meet with my
story to make this just observation from it, viz.
How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which,
when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us,
is oftentimes the very means or door of our deli-
verance, by which alone we can be raised again
from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give
many examples of this in the course of my unac-
countable life; but in nothing was it more particu-
larly remarkable than in the circumstances of my
last years of solitary residence in this island.
It was now the month of December, as I said
above, in my twenty-third year; and this being the
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was
the particular time of my harvest, and required my
being pretty much abroad in the fields; when
going out pretty early in the morning, even before
it was thorough day-light, I was surprised with
seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a dis-
tance from me of about two miles, towards the
end of the island, where I had observed some sa-
vages had been, as before; but not on the other
side: but to my great affliction, it was on my side
of the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go
out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no
more peace within, from the apprehensions I had,
that if these savages, in rambling over the island,
should find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my
works and improvements, they would immediately
conclude that there were people in the place, and
would then never give over till they found me out.
In this extremity I went back directly to my castle,
pulled up the ladder after me, having made all
things without look as wild and natural as I could.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself
in a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon,
as I called them, that is to say, my musquets,
which were mounted upon my new fortification,
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself
to the last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to re-
commend myself to the divine protection, and ear-
nestly to pray to GoD to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I con-
tinued about two hours, but began to be mighty
impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies
to send out.
After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sit-
ting in ignorance longer; so setting up my ladder
to the side of the hill, where there was a flat
place, as I observed before, and then pulling the
ladder up after me, I set it up again, and mounted
to the top of the hill; and pulling out my perspec-
tive glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me
down flat on my belly on the ground, and began
to look for the place. I presently found there
were no less than nine naked savages sitting round
a small fire they had made; not to warm them,
for they had no need of that, the weather being
extreme hot; but, as I supposed, to dress some of
their barbarous diet of human flesh which they had
brought with them, whether alive or dead I could
not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and as it was then tide
of ebb, they seemed to me to wait the return of
the flood to go away again. It is not easy to ima-
gine what confusion this sight put me into, espe-
cially seeing them come on my side the island, and
so near me too; but when I observed their coming
must be always with the current of the ebb, I be-
gan afterwards to be more sedate in my mind,
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety
all the time of tide of flood, if they were not on
shore before; and having made this observation, I
went abroad about my harvest work with the more
composure. - -
As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take
boat, and row (or paddle as we call it) all away.
I should have observed, that for an hour and more
before they went off, they went to dancing, and
I could easily discern their postures and gestures
by my glasses: I could only perceive, by my
nicest observation, that they were stark naked,
and had not the least covering upon them; but
whether they were men or women, that I could
not distinguish.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard; and with all the speed I was able to
make, I went away to the hill, where I had disco-
vered the first appearance of all. As soon as I got
thither, which was not less than two hours (for
I could not go apace, being so loaded with arms
as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes
more of savages on that place; and looking out
farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making
over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when
going down to the shore, I could see the marks
of horror which the dismal work they had been
about had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones,
and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and
devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport. I was so filled with indignation at the sight,
that I began now to premeditate the destruction of
the next that I saw there, let them be who or how
many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which
they thus made to this island were not very fre-
quent; for it was above fifteen months before any
more of them came on shore there again; that is
to say, I never saw them, or any footsteps or sig-
nals of them, in all that time; for as to the rainy
seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at
least not so far: yet all this while I lived uncom-
fortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I
was in of their coming upon me by surprise; from
whence I observe, that the expectation of evil, is
more bitter than the suffering, especially if there
is no room to shake off that expectation or those
apprehensions. -
During all this time, I was in the murdering
humour; and took up most of my hours, which
should have been better employed, in contriving
how to circumvent and fall upon them the very
next time I should see them; especially if they
should be divided, as they were the last time, into
two parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I
killed one party, suppose ten or a dozen, I was
still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I
should be at length no less a murderer than they
were in being men-eaters, and perhaps much
II].OTe SO.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day
or other fall into the hands of those merciless
creatures. If I did at any time venture abroad, it
was not without looking around me with the great-
est care and caution imaginable; and now I found,
to my great comfort, how happy it was that I had
provided a tame flock or herd of goats; for I durst
not, upon any account, fire my gun, especially near
that side of the island where they usually came,
lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had
fled from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred
canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew
what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months
more before I ever saw any more of the savages,
and then I found them again, as I shall soon ob-
serve. It is true, they might have been there once
or twice, but either they made no stay, or, at least,
I did not hear them; but in the month of May, as
near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twen-
tieth year, I had a very strange encounter with
them, of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months interval, was very great; I slept
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and
often started out of my sleep in the night: in the
day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and
the reasons why I might justify the doing of it.
But to wave all this for a while, it was the middle
of May, on the sixteenth day, I think, as well as
my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I
marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the
sixteenth of May, that it blew a great storm of
wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and
thunder, and a very foul night was after it. I
know not what was the particular occasion of it:
but as I was reading in the bible, and taken up
with serious thoughts about my present condition,
I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I
thought, fired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite dif-
ferent nature from any I had met with before; for
the notions this put into my thoughts were quite
of another kind. I started up in the greatest haste
imaginable; and in a trice clapped up my ladder
to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it after
me, and mounting it the second time, got to the
top of the hill; that very moment a flash of fire
bade me listen for a second gun, which accord-
ingly in about half a moment I heard, and by the
sound knew that it was from that part of the sea
where I was driven out with the current in my boat.
VOL. I. S
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade,
or some other ship in company, and fired these
guns for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I
had this presence of mind at that minute as to
think, that though I could not help them, it may
be they might help me: so I brought together al
the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a
good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill:
the wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though
the wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out,
so that I was certain, if there was any such thing
as a ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they
did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard
another gun, and after that several others, all from
the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long,
till day broke; and when it was broad day, and the
air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance
at sea, full east of the island; whether a sail or an
hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glasses,
the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also; at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently
concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and being
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my
gun in my hand, and ran towards the south-east
side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been
formerly carried away with the current; and get-
ting up there, the weather by this time being per-
fectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sor-
row, the wreck of a ship cast away in the night
upon those concealed rocks which I found when
I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a
kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were the occa-
sion of my recovering then from the most despe-
rate, hopeless condition, that ever I had been in
all my life. -
Thus, what is one man’s safety is another man's
destruction; for it seems these men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E.
and E. N. E. Had they seen the island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I
thought, have endeavoured to have saved them-
selves on shore by the help of their boat; but the
firing of their guns for help, especially when they
saw, as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many
thoughts: first, I imagined, that, upon seeing my
light, they might have put themselves into their
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore;
but that the sea going very high, they might have
been cast away: other times I imagined, that they
might have lost their boat before, as might be the
case many ways; as particularly, by the breaking
of the sea upon their ship, which many times
obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat;
and sometimes to throw it overboard with their
own hands: other times I imagined, they had
some other ship or ships in company, who, upon
S 2
the signals of distress they had made, had taken
them up, and carried them off: otherwhiles I fan-
cied they were all gone off to sea in their boat, and
being hurried away by the current that I had been
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean,
where there was nothing but misery and perishing;
and that perhaps they might by this time think of
starving, and of being in a condition to eat one
another. -
As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in
the condition I was in, I could do no more than
look upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them; which had still this good effect on my side,
that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to GoD, who had so happily and comfortably pro-
vided for me in my desolate condition; and that
of two ships companies, who were now cast away
upon this part of the world, not one life should be
spared but mine. I learned here again to observe,
that it is very rare that the providence of GoD casts
us into any condition of life so low, or any misery
so great, but we may see something or other to be
thankful for, and may see others in worse circum-
stances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of
whom I could not so much as see room to suppose
any of them were saved; nothing could make it
rational, so much as to wish or expect that they
did not all perish there, except the possibility only
of their being taken up by another ship in com-
pany: and this was but mere possibility indeed ;
for I saw not the least signal or appearance of any
such thing.
I cannot explain, by any possible energy of
words, what a strange longing, or hankering of
desire, I felt in my soul upon this sight; breaking
out sometimes thus: O that there had been but
one or two, nay, but one soul saved out of the ship,
to have escaped to me, that I might but have had
one companion, one fellow-creature to have spoken
to me, and to have conversed with ! In all the time
of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so strong
a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or
so deep a regret at the want of it.
There are some secret moving springs in the
affections, which, when they are set a going by
some object in view, or be it some object though
not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by
the power of imagination, that motion carries out
the soul by its impetuosity to such violent eager
embracings of the object, that the absence of it is
insupportable. - -
Such were these earnest wishings, That but one
man had been saved O that it had been but one !
I believe I repeated the words, O that it had been
but one a thousand times; and my desires were
so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press
the palms of my hands, that if I had had any soft
thing in my hand, it would have crushed it involun-
tarily; and my teeth in my head would strike toge-
ther, and set againstone another so strong, that for
some time I could not part them again.
S 3
Let the naturalists explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them: all I can say of them
is, to describe the fact, which was ever surprising
to me when I found it, though I knew not from
what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect
of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in
my mind, realizing the comfort which the conver-
sation of one of my fellow-christians would have
been to me.
But it was not to be ; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbad it; for till the last year of my being
on this island, I never knew whether any were
saved out of that ship, or no ; and had only the
affliction some days after to see the corpse of a
drowned boy come on shore, at the end of the
island which was next the shipwreck: he had on
no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open-
kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what na-
tion he was of: he had nothing in his pocket but
two pieces of eight, and a tobacco-pipe ; the last
was to me of ten times more value than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to
venture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubt-
ing but I might find something on board that
might be useful to me; but that did not altoge-
ther press me so much, as the possibility that there
might be yet some living creature on board, whose
life I might not only save, but might, by saving
that life, comfort my own to the last degree: and
this thought clung so to my heart, that I could
not be quiet night nor day, but I must venture out
in my boat on board this wreck; and committing
the rest to God’s providence, I thought the im-
pression was so strong upon my mind, that it could.
not be resisted, that it must come from some invi-
sible direction, and that I should be wanting to my-
self if I did not go. -
Under the power of this impression, I hastened
back to my castle, prepared every thing for my
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for
fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum
(for I had still a great deal of that left), a basket-
full of raisins: and thus loading myself with every
thing necessary, I went down to my boat, got the
water out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my
cargo in her, and then went home again for more:
my second cargo was a great bag-full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, an-
other large pot-full of fresh water, and about two
dozen of my small loaves, or barley cakes, more
than before, with a bottle of goat's milk, and a
cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat, I
brought to my boat; and praying to God to direct
my voyage, I put out, and rowing or paddling the
canoe along the shore, I came at last to the utmost
point of the island, on that side, viz. N. E. And
now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either
to venture, or not to venture; I looked on the
rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides
of the island, at a distance, and which were very
terrible to me, from the remembrance of the hazard
S 4
I had been in before, and my heart began to fail
me; for I foresaw, that if I was driven into either
of those currents, I should be carried a vast way
out to sea, and perhaps out of my reach or sight of
the island again; and that then, as my boat was but
small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should
be inevitably lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I
began to give over my enterprise; and having
haled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I
stepped out, and sat me down upon a little spot of
rising ground, very pensive and anxious, between
fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned,
and the flood came on, upon which my going was
for so many hours impracticable: upon this it pre-
sently occurred to me, that I should go up to the
highest piece of ground I could find, and observe,
if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay,
when the flood came in, that I might judge whe-
ther, if I was driven one way out, I might not
expect to be driven another way home, with the
same rapidness of the currents. This thought was
no sooner in my head, but I cast my eyes upon a
little hill which sufficiently overlooked the sea both
ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the
currents, or sets of the tide, and which way I was
to guide myselfin my return: here I found, that as
the current of the ebb set out close by the south
point of the island, so the current of the flood set
in close by the shore of the north side; and that I
had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the
island in my return, and I should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved
the next morning to set out with the first of the
tide; and reposing myself for that night in the
canoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned, I
launched out. I made first a little out to sea, full
north, till I began to feel the benefit of the cur-
rent, which set eastward, and which carried me at
a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as the
southern-side current had done before, and so as
to take from me all government of the boat; but
having a strong steerage with my paddle, I went,
I say, at a great rate, directly for the wreck, and
in less than two hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal sight to look at; the ship, which
by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks; all the stern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with, the sea; and as her fore-
castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were
brought by the board, that is to say, broken short
off, but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and
bow appeared firm. When I came close to her, a
dog appeared upon her, which, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and as soon as I called him,
jumped into the sea to come to me; and I took
him into the boat, but found him almost dead for
hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread,
and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been
starving a fortnight in the snow. I then gave
the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if
I would have let him, he would have burst him-
self. - - -
After this I went on board: the first sight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about
one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the
sea broke so high, and so continually over her,
that the men were not able to bear it, and were
strangled with the constant rushing in of the water,
as much as if they had been under water; besides
the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that
had life, nor any goods that I could see, but what
were spoiled by the water: there were some casks
of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew not,
which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water
being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too
big to meddle with. I saw several chests, which
I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and I
got two of them into the boat without examining
what was in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the
fore-part broken off, I am persuaded I might have
made a good voyage; for by what I found in these
two chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a
great deal of wealth on board; and if I may guess
by the course she steered, she must have been
bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la
Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the
Brasils, to the Havanna, in the gulph of Mexico,
and so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a
great treasure in her, but of no use at that time to
any body; and what became of the rest of her
people I then knew not.
I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into
my boat with much difficulty: there were several
musquets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn,
with about four pounds of powder in it; as for the
musquets, I had no occasion for them, so I left
them, but took the powder-horn; I took a fire-
shovel and tongs, which I wanted extremely; as
also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo,
and the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to
make home again; and the same evening about an
hour within night, I reached the island again,
weary and fatigued to the last degree. .
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in
my new cave, not to carry it home to my castle.
After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on
shore, and began to examine the particulars: the
cask of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not
such as we had at the Brasils; and, in a word, not
at all good; but when I came to open the chests,
I found several things which I wanted: for exam-
ple, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an ex-
traordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters,
fine, and very good; the bottles held about three
pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found
two pots of very good succades, or sweet-meats,
so fastened also on the top, that the salt water had
not hurt them; and two more of the same, which
the water had spoiled. I found some very good
shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about
a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs,
and coloured neckcloths; the former were also
very welcome, being exceeding refreshing, to wipe
my face in an hot day: besides this, when I came to
the till in the chests, I found there three great bags
of pieces of eight, which held about eleven hundred
pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a
paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars
or wedges of gold; I suppose they might all weigh
near a pound.
The other chest I found had some clothes in it,
but of little value; but by the circumstances, it
must have belonged to the gunner's mate, as there
was no powder in it, but about two pounds of
glazed powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose,
for charging their fowling-pieces on occasion.
Upon the whole, I got very little by this voyage
that was of much use to me; for as to the money,
I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me
as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given
it for three or four more pair of English shoes and
stockings, which were things I greatly wanted,
but had not had on my feet now for many years.
I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I
took off the feet of the two drowned men whom
I saw in the wreck; and I found two pair more in
one of the chests, which were very welcome to
me; but they were not like our English shoes, ei-
ther for ease or service, being rather what we call
pumps than shoes. I found in the seamen’s chest
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold;
I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the
other, which seemed to belong to some officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before
which I brought from our own ship; but it was
great pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship
had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I
might have loaded my canoe several times over
with money, which, if I had ever escaped to Eng.
land, would have lain here safe enough till I
might have come again and fetched it.
Having now brought all mythings on shore, and
secured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour,
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to my old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family
affairs; and for a while I lived easy enough, only
that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much ; and
if at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was
pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and
where I could go without so many precautions,
and such a load of arms and ammunition, as
LIFE AND ADVENTURES
I always carried with me, if I went the other
way.
I lived in this condition near two years more ;
but my unlucky head, that was always to let me
know it was born to make my body miserable, was
all these two years filled with projects and designs,
how, if it were possible, I might get away from
this island; for sometimes I was for making ano-
ther voyage to the wreck, though my reason told
me, that there was nothing left there worth the
hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble one
way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I
had the boat that I went from Sallee in, I should
have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew
not-whither.
I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento
of those who are touched with that general plague
of mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half
of their miseries flow; I mean, that of not being
satisfied with the station wherein GoD and nature
hath placed them; for, not to look back upon my
primitive condition, and the excellent advice of my
father, the opposition to which was, as I may call
it, my original sin, my subsequent mistakes of the
same kind have been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence,
which so happily had seated me at the Brasils as a
planter, blessed me with confined desires, and
could I have been contented to have gone on gra-
dually, I might have been by this time, I mean
in the time of my being on this island, one of the
most considerable planters in the Brasils; nay, I
am persuaded, that by the improvement I had
made in that little time I lived there, and the in-
crease I should probably have made if I had staid,
I might have been worth an hundred thousand
moidores; and what business had I to leave a set-
tled fortune, well-stocked plantation, improving
and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea, to
fetch Negroes, when patience and time would so
have increased our stock at home, that we could
have bought them at our own doors, from those
whose business it was to fetch them 2 And though
it had cost us something more, yet the difference
of that price was by no means worth saving at so
great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads,
so reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the
exercise of more years, or of the dear-bought ex-
perience of time; and so it was with me now; and
yet, so deep had the mistake taken root in my
temper, that I could not satisfy myself in my sta-
tion, but was continually poring upon the means
and possibility of my escape from this place; and
that I may, with the greater pleasure to the
reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it
may not be improper to give some account of my
first conceptions on the subject of this foolish
scheme for my escape; and how and upon what
foundation I acted.
I am now to be supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my fri-
gate laid up, and secured under water as usual, and
my condition restored to what it was before. I
had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but
was not at all the richer; for I had no more use
for it than the Indians of Peru had before the Spa-
niards came thither. -
It was one of the nights in the rainy season in
March, the four-and-twentieth year of my first
setting foot in this island of solitariness, I was ly-
ing in my bed or hammock, awake, and very well
in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness
of body, no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than
ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes,
that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink all night
long, otherwise than as follows:
It is as impossible as needless to set down the
innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled
through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the
memory, in this night's time. I ran over the
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridg-
ment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island;
and also of that part of my life since I came to
this island. In my reflections upon the state of
my case, since I came on shore on this island, I
was comparing the happy posture of my affairs in
the first year of my habitation here, to that
course of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had
lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot
in the sand; not that I did not believe the savages
had frequented the island even all the while, and
might have been several hundreds of them at times
on the shore there; but as I had never known it,
and was incapable of any apprehensions about it,
my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was
the same; and I was as happy in not knowing my
danger, as if I had never really been exposed to it;
this furnished my thoughts with many very pro-
fitable reflections, and particularly this one: How
infinitely good that Providence is, which has set-
tled in its government of mankind such narrow
bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and
though he walks in the midst of so many thousand
dangers, the sight of which, if discovered to him,
would distract his mind, and sink his spirits, he is
kept serene and calm, by having the event of
things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of
the dangers which surround him.
After these thoughts had for some time enter-
tained me, I came to reflect seriously upon the real
danger I had been in for so many years in this very
island; and how I had walked about in the great-
est security and with all possible tranquillity, even
perhaps when nothing but a brow on a hill, a
great tree, or the casual approach of night, had
been between me and the worst kind of destruc-
tion, viz. that of falling into the hands of canni-
bals and savages, who would have seized on me
with the same view as I did on a goat or a turtle,
and have thought it no more a crime to kill and
devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a curlew ; I
should unjustly slander myself, if I should say I
was not sincerely thankful to my great Preserver,
VOL. I. T
to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with
great humility, that all these unknown deliverances
were due, and without which I should inevitably
have fallen into their merciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my head was
for some time taken up in considering the nature
of these wretched creatures, I mean, the savages;
and how it came to pass in the world, that the
wise Governor of all things should give up any of
his creatures to such inhumanity, nay, to some-
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to
devour its own kind : but as this ended in some
(at that time fruitless) speculations, it occurred to
me to inquire what part of the world these
wretches lived in; how far off the coast was from
whence they came; what they ventured so far
from home for; what kind of boats they had ; and
why I might not order myself, and my business
so, that I might be as able to go over thither as
they were to come to me.
I never so much as troubled myself to consider,
what I should do with myself when I came thi-
ther; what should become of me if I fell into the
hands of the savages; or how I should escape from
them, if they attempted me; no, nor so much as
how it was possible for me to reach the coast, and
not be attacked by some or other of them, without
any possibility of delivering myself; and if I should
not fall into their hands, what I should do for pro-
vision, or whither I should bend my course; none
of these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my
way; but my mind was wholly bent upon the
notion of my passing over in my boat to the main
land. I looked back upon my present condition as
the most miserable that could possibly be; that I
was not able to throw myself into any thing but
death, that could be called worse; that if I reached
the shore of the main, I might, perhaps, meet with
relief; or I might coast along, as I did on the
shore of Africa, till I came to some inhabited
country, and where I might find some relief; and
after all, perhaps, I might fall in with some Chris-
tian ship that might take me in ; and if the worst
came to the worst, I could but die, which would
put an end to all these miseries at once. Pray,
note, all this was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an
impatient temper, made, as it were, desperate by
the long continuance of my troubles, and the dis-
appointments I had met in the wreck I had been
on board of, and where I had been so near the ob-
taining of what I so earnestly longed for, viz.
somebody to speak to, and to learn some know-
ledge from of the place where I was, and of the
probable means of my deliverance: I say, I was
agitated wholly by these thoughts. All my calm
of mind in my resignation to Providence, and
waiting the issue of the dispositions of Heaven,
seemed to be suspended; and I had, as it were, no
power to turn my thoughts to any thing but the
project of a voyage to the main; which came upon
me with such force, and such an impetuosity of
desire, that it was not to be resisted.
T 2
When this had agitated my thoughts for two
hours or more, with such violence that it set my
very blood into a ferment, and my pulse beat as
high as if I had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, na-
ture, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with
the very thought of it, threw me into a sound
sleep : one would have thought I should have
dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any thing re-
lating to it; but I dreamed that as I was going
out in the morning, as usual, from my castle, I saw
upon the shore two canoes, and eleven savages
coming to land, and that they brought with them
another savage, whom they were going to kill, in
order to eat him; when, on a sudden, the savage
that they were going to kill, jumped away, and
ran for his life; then I thought in my sleep, that
he came running into my little thick grove, before
my fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing
him alone, and not perceiving that the others
sought him that way, shewed myself to him, and
smiling upon him, encouraged him, that he kneeled
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him;
upon which I shewed my ladder, made him go up
it, and carried him into my cave, and he became
my servant; and that as soon as I had got this
man, I said to myself, Now I may certainly ven-
ture to the main land; for this fellow will serve
me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and
whither to go for provisions, and whither not to
go for fear of being devoured; what places to ven-
ture into, and what to escape. I waked with this
thought, and was under such inexpressible impres-
sions of joy at the prospect of my escape in my
dream, that the disappointments which I felt upon
coming to myself, and finding it was no more than
a dream, were equally extravagant the other way,
and threw me into a very great dejection of spirit. .
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion,
that my only way to go about an attempt for an
escape, was, if possible, to get a savage in my pos-
session; and, if possible, it should be one of their
prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should bring hither to kill; but these thoughts
still were attended with this difficulty, that it was
impossible to effect this without attacking a whole
caravan of them, and killing them all; and this
was not only a very desperate attempt, and might
miscarry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly
scrupled the lawfulness of it to me, and my heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding so much
blood, though it was for my deliverance. I need
not repeat the arguments which occurred to me
against this, they being the same mentioned before:
but though I had other reasons to offer now, viz.
that those men were enemies to my life, and would
devour me, if they could; that it was self-preser-
yation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself
from this death of life, and was acting in my own
defence, as much as if they were actually assault-
ing me, and the like; I say, though these things
argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human
T 3
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me,
and such as I could by no means reconcile myself
to a great while.
However, at last, after many secret disputes
with myself, and after great perplexities about it
(for all these arguments, one way and another,
struggled in my head a long time), the eager pre-
vailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all
the rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get one of
these savages into my hands, cost what it would :
the next thing then was to contrive how to do it;
and this indeed was very difficult to resolve on: but
as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I
resolved to put myself upon the watch to see them
when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the
event, taking such measures as the opportunity
should present, let it be what it would.
With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set
myself upon the scout as often as possible, and
indeed so often, till I was heartily tired of it; for
it was above a year and a half that I waited, and
for a great part of that time went out to the west
end, and to the south-west corner of the island,
almost every day, to see the canoes, but none ap-
peared: this was very discouraging, and began to
trouble me much; though I cannot say that it did
in this case, as it had done some time before that,
viz. wear off the edge of my desire to the thing;
but the longer it seemed to be delayed, the more
eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first more
careful to shun the sight of these savages, and
avoid being seen by them, than I was now eager to
be upon them. -
Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one,
nay, two or three savages, if I had them, so as to
make them entirely slaves to me, to do whatever
I should direct them, and to prevent their being
able, at any time, to do me any hurt. It was a
great while that I pleased myself with this affair,
but nothing still presented; all my fancies and
schemes came to nothing, for no savages came near
me for a great while.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were,
resolved them all into nothing, for want of an
occasion to put them in execution, I was surprised
one morning early, with seeing no less than five
canoes all on shore together, on my side the island,
and the people who belonged to them all landed,
and out of my sight: the number of them broke
all my measures; for seeing so many, and knowing
that they always came four, or six, or sometimes
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my measures to attack twenty
or thirty men single-handed; so I lay still in my
castle, perplexed and discomforted: however, I
put myself into all the same postures for an attack
that I had formerly provided, and was just ready
for action, if any thing had presented. Having
waited a good while, listening to hear if they made
any noise; at length being very impatient, I set
my guns at the foot of my ladder, and clambered
T 4
up to the top of the hill by my two stages, as
usual; standing so, however, that my head did not
appear above the hill, so that they could not per-
ceive me by any means: here I observed, by the
help of my perspective glass, that they were no
less than thirty in number; that they had a fire
kindled, and that they had meat dressed; how
they cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was ;
but they were all dancing in I know not how
many barbarous gestures and figures, their own
way, round the fire. º - -
... When I was thus looking on them, I perceived
by my perspective two miserable wretches dragged
from the boats, where, it seems, they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fall, being
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden
sword, for that was their way; and two or three
others were at work immediately, cutting him open
for their cookery, while the other victim was left
standing by himself, till they should be ready for
him: in that very moment this poor wretch, seeing
himself a little at liberty, nature inspired him with
hopes of life, and he started away from them, and
ran with incredible swiftness along the sands, di-
rectly towards me, I mean, towards that part of the
coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
ledge) when I perceived him to run my way; and
especially when, as I thought, I saw him pursued
by the whole body; and now I expected that part
of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would
certainly take shelter in my grove; but I could
not depend, by any means, upon my dream for
the rest of it, viz. that the other savages would
not pursue him thither, and find him there. How-
ever, I kept my station, and my spirits began to
recover, when I found that there were not above
three men that followed him ; and still more was
I encouraged, when I found he outstript them ex-
ceedingly in running, and gained ground of them,
so that if he could but hold it for half an hour, I
saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the
creek, which I mentioned often at the first part of
my story, when I landed my cargoes out of the
ship; and this I knew, he must necessarily swim
over, or the poor wretch would be taken there:
but when the savage escaping came thither, he
made nothing of it, though the tide was then up;
but plunging in, swam • through, in about thirty
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ranton with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three
pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and that
he, standing on the other side, looked at the other,
but went no farther; and soon after went softly
back again, which, as it happened, was very well
for him in the main. 7
I observed, that the two who swam were yet
more than twice as long swimming over the creek
than the fellow was that fled from them. It came
now very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed
irresistibly, that now was my time to get a ser-
vant, and perhaps a companion, or assistant, and
that I was called plainly by Providence to save this
poor creature's life. I immediately got down the
ladders with all possible expedition, fetched my
two guns, for they were both at the foot of the
ladder, as I observed above; and getting up again
with the same haste to the top of the hill, I crossed
towards the sea; and having a very short cut, and
all down hill, clapped myself in the way between
the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to
him that fled, who, looking back, was at first per-
haps as much frighted at me as I at them; but I
beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the
two that followed; then rushing at once upon the
foremost, I knocked him down with the stock of
my piece; I was loth to fire, because I would not
have the rest hear, though at that distance it
would not have been easily heard; and being out
of sight of the smoke too, they would not have
easily known what to make of it. Having knocked
this fellow down, the other who pursued him
stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I ad-
vanced apace towards him ; but as I came nearer,
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow,
and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then
necessitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and
killed him at the first shot. The poor savage who
fled, but had stopped, though he saw both his

enemies fallen, and killed (as he thought) yet was
so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece,
that he stood stock-still, and neither came forward
nor went backward, though he seemed rather
inclined to fly still than to come on. I hallooed
again to him, and made signs to come forward,
which he easily understood, and came a little way,
then stopped again, and then a little farther, and
stopped again; and I could then perceive that he
stood trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner,
and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies
were. I beckoned him again to come to me, and
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token
of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled
at him and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to
him to come still nearer. At length he came close
to me, and he then kneeled down again, kissed
the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and
taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his head.
This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my
slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there
was more work to do yet; for I perceived the sa-
vage, whom I knocked down, was not killed, but
stunned with the blow, and began to come to him-
self: so I pointed to him, and shewed him the sa-
vage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke
some words to me; and though I could not under-
stand them, yet I thought they were pleasant to
hear, for they were the first sound of a man's
voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for
above five-and-twenty years. But there was no
time for such reflections now : the savage, who
was knocked down, recovered himself so far as
to sit up upon the ground; and I perceived that
my savage began to be afraid; but when I saw
that, I presented my other piece at the man, as if I
would shoot him : upon this my savage, for so I
call him now, made a motion to me to lend him
my sword, which hung naked in a belt by my
side; so I did: he no sooner had it, but he runs
to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head so
cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have
done it sooner or better; which I thought it very
strange for one, who, I had reason to believe, never
saw a sword in his life before, except their own
wooden swords. However it seems, as I learned
afterwards, they make their wooden swords so
sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that they
will cut off heads even with them, nay, and arms,
and that at one blow too. When he had done this,
he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and, with abundance
of gestures, which I did not understand, laid it
down, with the head of the savage that he had
killed, just before me.
But that which astonished him most was, to
know how I had killed the other Indian so far off;
so pointing to him, he made signs to me to let
him go to him: so I bade him go, as well as I
could. When he came to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him ; turned him first on
one side, then on the other; looked at the wound
the bullet had made, which it seems was just in
his breast, where it had made an hole, and no
great quantity of blood had followed; but he had
bled inwardly, for he was quite dead: then he took
up his bow and arrows, and came back; so I
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow
me, making signs to him that more might come
after them. . - -
Upon this he signed to me that he should bury
them with sand, that they might not be seen by
the rest, if they followed; and so I made signs
again to him to do so: he fell to work, and in an
instant he had scraped an hole in the sand with
his hands, big enough to bury the first in, and
then dragged him into it, and covered him, and
did so also by the other. I believe he had buried
them both in a quarter of an hour: then calling
him, away, I carried him not to my castle, but
quite away to my cave, on the farther part of the
island; so I did not let my dream come to pass in
that part; viz. that he came into my grove for
shelter. - - -
Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins
to eat, and a draught of water, , which I found he
was indeed in great distress for, by his running;
and having refreshed him, I made signs for him
to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place
where I had laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and
w
a blanket upon it, which I used to sleep upon my-
self sometimes: so the poor creature lay down, and
went to sleep.
He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly
well made, with straight long limbs, not too
large, tall, and well-shaped, and, as I reckon,
about twenty-six years of age. He had a very
good countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect,
but seemed to have something very manly in his
face, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness
of an European in his countenance too, especially
when he smiled: his hair was long and black, not
curled like wool; his forehead very high and large,
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in
his eyes. The colour of his skin was not quite
black, but very tawny, and yet not of an ugly
yellow nauseous tawny, as the Brasilians and Vir-
ginians, and other natives of America are ; but of
a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that had in it
something very agreeable, though not very easy
to describe. His face was round and plump, his
nose small, not flat like the negroes, a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-set, and
white as ivory. After he had slumbered, rather
than slept, about half an hour, he waked again,
and comes out of the cave to me, for I had been
milking my goats, which I had in the enclosure
just by. When he espied me, he came running to
me, laying himself down again upon the ground,
with all the possible signs of an humble thankful
disposition, making many antic gestures to shew
it. At last he lays his head flat upon the ground,
close to my foot, and sets my other foot upon his
head, as he had done before ; and after this, made
all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and
submission imaginable, to let me know how much
he would serve me as long as he lived. I under-
stood him in many things, and let him know I was
very well pleased with him. In a little time I
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to
me: and first, I made him know his name should
be Friday, which was the day I saved his life; and
I called him so for the memory of the time. I
likewise taught him to say Master, and then let
him know that was to be my name; I likewise
taught him to say Yes and No, and to know the
meaning of them. I gave him some milk in an
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before
him, sop my bread in it; and I gave him a cake
of bread to do the like, which he quickly complied
with, and made signs that it was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me,
and let him know I would give him some clothes;
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark-
naked. As we went by the place where he had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot,
and shewed me the marks that he had made to
find them again, making signs to me that we should
dig them up again and eat them. At this I ap-
peared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it,
made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and
beckoned with my hand to him to come away,
which he did immediately, with great submission.
I then led him up to the top of the hill, to see if
his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had
been, but no appearance of them, or of their canoes;
so that it was plain that they were gone, and had
left their two comrades behind them, without any
search after them.
But I was not content with this discovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving
him the sword in his hand, with the bow and ar-
rows at his back, which I found he could use very
dexterously, making him carry one gun for me,
and I two for myself, and away we marched to the
place where these creatures had been; for I had a
mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them.
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill
in my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the
horror of the spectacle: indeed it was a dreadful
sight, at least it was so to me, though Friday made
nothing of it. The place was covered with human
bones, the ground dyed with the blood, great pieces
of flesh left here and there half-eaten, mangled,
and scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the
triumphant feast they had been making there, after
a victory over their enemies. I saw three skulls,
five hands, and the bones of three or four legs and
feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies;
and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that
they brought over four prisoners to feast upon; that
three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing
to himself, was the fourth : that there had been a
great battle between them and their next king,
whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of; and
that they had taken a great number of prisoners, all
which were carried to several places by those that
had taken them in the flight, in order to feast
upon them, as was done here by these wretches
upon those they brought hither. -
I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones,
flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them toge-
ther on an heap, and make a great fire upon it,
and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday had
still an hankering stomach after some of the flesh,
and was still a cannibal in his nature; but I disco-
vered so much abhorrence at the very thoughts of
it, and at the least appearance of it, that he durst
not discover it; for I had, by some means, let him
know, that I would kill him if he offered it.
When he had done this, we came back to our
castle, and there I fell to work with my man Fri-
day. And first of all, I gave him a pair of linen
drawers which I had out of the poor gunner's
chest I mentioned, and which I found in the
wreck; and which, with a little alteration, fitted
him very well: then I made him a jerkin of goat's-
skin as well as my skill would allow, and I was
now grown a tolerably good tailor; and I gave him
a cap, which I had made of a hare-skin, very con-
venient, and fashionable enough; and thus he was
VOL. I. U
dressed, for the present, tolerably well, and mighty
well was he pleased to see himself almost as well
clothed as his master: it is true, he went awkwardly
in these things at first; wearing the drawers was
very awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waist-
coat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms;
but a little easing them, where he complained they
hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he
took to them very well.
The next day after I came home to my hutch
with him, I began to consider where I should
lodge him; and that I might do well for him, and
yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent
for him in the vacant place between my two forti-
fications, in the inside of the last, and in the out-
side of the first: and as there was a door or en-
trance there into my cave, I made a formal framed
door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up
in the passage, a little within the entrance; and
causing the door to open on the inside, I barred it
up in the night, taking in my ladders too; so that
Friday could no way come at me in the inside of
my innermost wall, without making so much noise
in getting over, that it must needs awaken me;
for my first wall had now a complete roof over it of
long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to
the side of the hill, which was again laid across with
small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched
over a great thickness with the rice-straw, which
was strong like reeds; and at the hole or place
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had
placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had been
attempted on the outside, would not have opened
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great noise; and as to weapons, I took them all
into my side every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution; for
never man had a more faithful, loving, sincere ser-
vant than Friday was to me; without passions, sul-
lenness, or designs; perfectly obliging and engag-
ing; his very affections were tied to me, like those
of a child to a father; and I dare say he would
have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon
any occasion whatsoever: the many testimonies he
gave me of this, put it out of doubt ; and soon con-
vinced me, that I needed to use no precautions as
to my safety on his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and
that with wonder, that however it had pleased
GoD in his providence, and in the government of
the works of his hands, to take from so great a
part of the world, of his creatures, the best uses to
which their faculties and the powers of their souls
are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them
the same powers, the same reason, the same affec-
tions, the same sentiments of kindness and obliga-
tion, the same passions and resentments of wrongs,
the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and
all the capacities of doing good, and receiving good,
that he has given to us; and that when he pleases
to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are
as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the
U 2
right uses for which they were bestowed than we
are. And this made me very melancholy some-
times, in reflecting, as the several occasions pre-
sented, how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlightened by the
great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of GoD, and
by the knowledge of his word, added to our un-
derstanding; and why it has pleased GoD to hide
the like saving knowledge from so many millions
of souls, who, if one might judge by this poor sa-
vage, would make a much better use of it than
we did. ' ... "
From hence I sometimes was led too far to in-
vade the sovereignty of Providence; and, as it
were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposi-
tion of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like
duty from both: but I shut it up, and checked my
thoughts with this conclusion. First, that we do
not know by what light and law these should be
condemned; but that as GoD was necessarily, and
by the nature of his being, infinitely holy and just,
so it could not be, but that if these creatures were
all sentenced to absence from himself, it was on
account of sinning against that light, which, as
the scripture says, was a law to themselves, and
by such rules as their consciences would acknow-
ledge to be just, though the foundation was not
discovered to us; and, secondly, that still, as we
are all clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel
could say to him, why hast thou formed me thus?
But to return to my new companion. I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my busi.
ness to teach him every thing that was proper to
make him useful, handy, and helpful; but espe-
cially to make him speak, and understand me when
I spake: and he was the aptest scholar that ever
was ; and particularly was so merry, so constantly.
diligent, and so pleased when he could but under-
stand me, or make me understand him, that it was
very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my
life began to be so easy that I began to say to
myself, that could I but have been safe from more
savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from
the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to
my castle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the
relish of a cannibal’s stomach, I ought to let him
taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one
morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring it
home and dress it: but as I was going, I saw a
she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young
kids sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday,
Hold, said I, stand still ; and made signs to him
not to stir; immediately I presented my piece,
shot and killed one of the kids. The poor crea-
ture, who had, at a distance indeed, seen me kill
the savage, his enemy, but did not know or could
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised,
trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that
U 3
I thought he would have sunk down; he did not
see the kid I had shot at, or perceive I had killed
it, but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not
wounded; and, as I found, presently thought I was
resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled
down to me, and, embracing my knees, said a
great many things I did not understand; but I
could easily see that his meaning was to pray me
not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I
would do him no harm; and taking him up by the
hand, laughed at him, and pointing to the kid
which I had killed, beckoned to him to run and
fetch it, which he did; and while he was wonder-
ing and looking to see how the creature was killed,
I loaded my gun again, and by and by I saw a
great fowl, like an hawk, sit upon a tree within
shot: so, to let Friday understand a little what I
would do, I called him to me again, pointing at
the fowl, which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been an hawk; I say, pointing to
the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the parrot, to let him see I would make him fall,
I made him understand that I would shoot and
kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bid him
look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall. He
stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all
that I had said to him; and I found he was the
more amazed, because he did not see me put any
thing into the gun; but thought there must be
Some wonderful fund of death and destruction in
that thing, able to kill man, beast, bird, or any
thing near or far off: for the astonishment this
created in him was such as could not wear off for
along time; and I believe, if I would have let him,
he would have worshipped me and my gun: as for
the gun itself, he would not so much as touch it for
several days after; but would speak to it, and talk
to it, as if it had answered him, when he was by
himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was
to desire it not to kill him.
Well: after his astonishment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I
had shot, which he did, but staid some time; for
the parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a
good way off from the place where she fell; how-
ever he found her, took her up, and brought her
to me; and, as I had perceived his ignorance about
the gun before, I took this advantage to charge
the gun again, and not let him see me do it, that
I might be ready for any other mark that might
present; but nothing more offered at that time:
so I brought home the kid; and the same evening I
took the skin off, and cut it out as well as I could;
and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or
stewed some of the flesh, and made some very
good broth. After I had began to eat some, I gave
some to my man, who seemed very glad of it, and
liked it very well; but that which was strangest
to him, was, to see me eat salt with it. He made
a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat; and
putting a little into his own mouth, he seemed to
U 4
nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at it, wash-
ing his mouth with fresh water after it; on the
other hand, I took some meat in my mouth with-
out salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for
want of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt; but
it would not do, he would never care for salt with
meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great while,
and then but a very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and
broth, I was resolved to feast him the next day
with roasting a piece of the kid: this I did by
hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen
many people do in England, setting two poles up,
one on each side the fire, and one across on the top,
and tying the string to the cross stick, letting the
meat turn continually: this Friday admired very
much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he
took so many ways to tell me how well he liked it,
that I could not but understand him; and at last he
told me he would never eat man's flesh any more,
which I was very glad to hear. - -
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do,
as I observed before; and he soon understood how
to do it as well as I, especially after he-had seen
what the meaning of it was, and that it was to
make bread of; for after that I let him see me
make my bread, and bake it too; and in a little
time Friday was able to do all the work for me, as
well as I could do it myself. . . ;
I began now to consider, that having two.
mouths to feed instead of one, I must provide more
ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity
of corn than I used to do; so I marked out a lar-
ger piece of land, and began the fence in the same
manner as before, in which Friday not only worked
very willingly, and very hard, but did it very
cheerfully; and I told him what it was for, that it
was for corn to make more bread, because he was
now with me, and that I might have enough for him
and myself too: he appeared very sensible of that
part, and let me know, that he thought I had much
more labour upon me on his account than I had
for myself, and that he would work the harder for
me, if I would tell him what to do. . . . *
This was the pleasantest year of all the life I le
in this place. Friday began to talk pretty well,
and understand the names of almost every thing
I had occasion to call for, and of every place I had
to send him to, and talk a great deal to me; so
that, in short, I began now to have some use for
my tongue again, which indeed I had very little
occasion for before ; that is to say, about speech.
Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a sin-
gular satisfaction in the fellow himself; his simple
unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and more
every day, and I began really to love the creature;
and on his side, I believe he loved me more than
it was possible for him ever to love any thing be-
fore. -
I had a mind once to try if he had any hanker-
ing inclination to his own country again; and
having taught him English so well that he could
answer me almost any questions, I asked him, whe-
ther the nation that he belonged to never conquered
in battle? At which he smiled, and said, Yes, yes,
we always fight the better; that is, he meant,
always get the better in fight; and so we began
the following discourse. You always fight the
better! said I. How came you to be taken pri-
soner then, Friday?
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Master. How beat? if your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken 2
Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me.
My nation over beat them in the yonder place,
where me no was; there my nation take one, two,
great thousand.
Master. But why did not your side recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe; my nation have no cano
that time. -
Master. Well, Friday, and what does your na-
tion do with the men they take Do they carry
them away, and eat them as these did?
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Master. Where do they carry them?
- Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Master. Do they come hither?
- Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither: come
other else place.
Master. Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here [points to the N. W.
side of the island, which, it seems, was their
side.] -
By this I understood, that my man Friday had
formerly been among the savages who used to
come on shore, on the farther part of the island,
on the said man-eating occasions that he was now
brought for; and some time after, when I took
the courage to carry him to that side, being the
same I formerly mentioned, he presently knew
the place, and told me, he was there once when
they eat up twenty men, two women, and one
child: he could not tell twenty in English, but he
numbered them by laying so many stones in a row,
and pointed to me to tell them over.
I have told this passage, because it introduces
what follows;–that after I had had this discourse
with him, I asked him, how far it was from our
island to the shore, and whether the canoes were
not often lost? He told me there was no danger,
no canoes ever lost; but that after a little way
out to sea, there was a current, and a wind always
one way in the morning, the other in the after-
Il OOIl.
This I understand to be no more than the sets
of the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after-
wards understood it was occasioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque;
in the mouth of which river, as I thought after-
wards, our island lay; and that this land, which I
perceived to the W. and N. W. was the great
island Trinidad, on the north point of the mouth
of the river: I asked Friday a thousand questions
about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the
coast, and what nations were near : he told me all
he knew, with the greatest openness imaginable.
I asked him the names of the several nations of
his sort of people, but could get no other name
than Caribs; from whence I easily understood,
that these were the Caribbees, which our maps
place on that part of America which reaches from
the mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea, and
onwards to St. Martha: he told me, that up a
great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond
the setting of the moon, which must be W. from
their country, there dwelt white-bearded men, like
me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I
mentioned before; and that they had killed much
mans, that was his word: by which I understood
he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in Ame-
rica had been spread over the whole countries,
and were remembered by all the nations from father
to SOn. - -
. I enquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this island, and get among those white men:
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe; I
could not understand what he meant by two canoe;
till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant,
that it must be in a large great boat as big as two
Ca11OeS. - -
This part of Friday's discourse began to relish
with me very well; and from this time I enter-
tained some hopes, that one time or other I might
find an opportunity to make my escape from this
place, and that this poor savage might be a means
to help me to do it. -
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to speak to me, and
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foun-
dation of religious knowledge in his mind; parti-
cularly, I asked him one time, Who made him 2
The poor creature did not understand me at all,
but thought I had asked who was his father: but
I took it by another handle, and asked him, Who
made the sea, the ground he walked on, and the
hills and woods? He told me, it was one old Bena-
muckee that lived beyond all; he could describe
nothing of this great person, but that he was very
old; much older, he said, than the sea or the land,
than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, If
this old person had made all things, why did not
all things worship him He looked very grave, and
with a perfect look of innocence, said, All things
said O' to him. I asked him if the people who die
in his country went away any-where? He said,
Yes, they all went to Benamuckee. Then I asked
him, whether those they eat up went thither too?
he said, Yes.
From these things I began to instruct him in
the knowledge of the true God. I told him that
the great Maker of all things lived there, pointing
up towards heaven: that he governs the world by
the same power and providence by which he made
it; that he was omnipotent, could do every thing
for us, give every thing to us, take every thing
from us; and thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes.
He listened with great attention, and received with
pleasure the notion of JESUS CHRIST being sent to
redeem us, and of the manner of making our
prayers to GoD, and his being able to hear us,
even into heaven. He told me one day, that if
our GoD could hear us up beyond the sun, he
must needs be a greater GoD than their Bena-
muckee, who lived but a little way off, and yet
could not hear, till they went up to the great
mountains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I
asked him, if ever he went thither to speak to him?
He said, No, they never went that were young
men; none went thither but the old men; whom
he called their Oowookakee, that is, as I made
him explain it to me, their religious, or clergy;
and that they went to say O! (so he called saying
prayers), and then came back, and told them what
Benamuckee said. By this I observed that there
is priestcraft even amongst the most blinded igno-
rant Pagans in the world; and the policy of mak-
ing a secret religion, in order to preserve the vene-
ration of the people to the clergy, is not only to be
found in the Roman, but perhaps among all reli-
gions in the world, even among the most brutish
and barbarous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday; and told him, that the pretence of their
old men going up to the mountains to say O! to
their god Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their
bringing word from thence what he said, was
much more so; that if they met with any answer,
or spoke with any one there, it must be with an
evil spirit: and then I entered into a long dis-
course with him about the devil, the original of
him, his rebellion against GoD, his enmity to man,
the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark
parts of the world to be worshipped instead of
GoD, and as GoD, and the many stratagems he
made use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how
he had a secret access to our passions and to our
affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations,
as to cause us even to be our own tempters, and
to run upon our own destructions by our own
choice.
I found it was not so easy to imprint right no-
tions in his mind about the devil as it was about
the being of a GoD : nature assisted all my argu-
ments to evidence to him even the necessity of a
great first cause, and over-ruling governing power,
a secret directing Providence, and of the equity
and justice of paying homage to him that made
us, and the like: but there appeared nothing of
all this in the notion of an evil spirit; of his ori-
ginal, his being, his nature, and above all, of his
inclination to do evil, and to draw us in to do so
too: and the poor creature puzzled me once in
such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that I scarce knew what to say to him.
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power
of God, his omnipotence, his dreadful aversion to
sin, his being a consuming fire to the workers of
iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could
destroy us, and all the world, in a moment; and
he listened with great seriousness to me all the
while.
. After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was GoD's enemy in the hearts of men, and used
all his malice and skill to defeat the good designs
of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom of CHRIST
in the world, and the like: Well, says Friday, but
you say God is so strong, so great, is he not much
strong, much might as the devil? Yes, yes, said I,
Friday, God is stronger than the devil: God is
above the devil, and therefore we pray to God to
tread him under our feet, and enable us to resist
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts. But
says he again, If God much strong, much might
as the devil, why God not kill the devil, so make
him no more wicked. -
, I was strangely surprised at his question; and
after all, though I was now an old man, yet I was
but a young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a
casuist or a solver of difficulties: and, at first, I
could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to
hear him, and asked him what he said 2 but he was
too earnest for an answer to forget his question:
so that he repeated it in the very same broken
words as above. By this time I had recovered
myself a little, and I said, GoD will at last punish
him severely; he is reserved for the judgment,
and is to be cast into the bottomless pit, to dwell
with everlasting fire. This did not satisfy Friday;
but he returns upon me, repeating my words, Re-
serve at last! me no understand; but why not kill
the devil now, not kill great ago? You may as
well ask me, said I, why God does not kill you
and me, when we do wicked things here that
offend him : we are preserved to repent and be
pardoned. He muses awhile at this: Well, well,
says he, mighty affectionately, that well; so you,
I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, repent, GoD par-
don all. Here I was run down again by him to
the last degree, and it was a testimony to me, how
the mere notions of nature, though they will guide
reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a God,
and of a worship or homage due to the supreme
being of GoD, as the consequence of our nature;
yet nothing but divine revelation can form the
knowledge of Jesus CHRIST, and of a redemption
purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new cove-
nant; and of an Intercessor at the footstool of
God's throne: I say nothing but a revelation from
Heaven can form these in the soul; and that there-
fore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
CHRIST, I mean the word of God, and the Spirit
of GoD, promised for the guide and sanctifier of
his people, are the absolutely necessary instructors
of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of
GoD, and the means of salvation.
VOL. I. X
I therefore diverted the present discourse be-
tween me and my man, rising up hastily, as upon
some sudden occasion of going out ; then sending
him for something a great way off, I seriously
prayed to GoD, that he would enable me to in-
struct savingly this poor savage, assisting by his
Spirit the heart of the poor ignorant creature to
receive the light of the knowledge of God in
CHRIST, reconciling him to himself, and would
guide me to speak so to him from the word of
GoD, as his conscience might be convinced, his
eyes opened, and his soul saved: when he came
again to me, I entered into a long discourse with
him upon the subject of the redemption of man
by the Saviour of the world, and of the doctrine
of the Gospel preached from heaven, viz. of re-
pentance towards GoD, and faith in our blessed
LoRD JESUs ; I then explained to him, as well as
I could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on
him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham,
and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no
share in the redemption; that he came only to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like.
I had, GoD knows, more sincerity than know-
ledge, in all the methods I took for this poor
creature’s instruction; and must acknowledge what
I believe all that act upon the same principle
will find, that in laying things open to him, I
really informed and instructed myself in many
things, that either I did not know, or had not
fully considered before; but which occurred na-
turally to my mind, upon my searching into them
for the information of this poor savage; and I had
more affection in my inquiry after things upon
this occasion, than ever I felt before : so that whe-
ther this poor wild wretch was the better for me
or no, I had great reason to be thankful that ever
he came to me: my grief sat lighter upon me, my
habitation grew comfortable to me beyond mea-
sure; and when I reflected, that in this solitary
life, which I had been confined to, I had not only
been moved myself to look up to Heaven, and to
seek to the hand that brought me thither, but was
now to be made an instrument, under Providence,
to save the life, and, for aught I know, the soul of
a poor savage, and bring him to the true know-
ledge of religion, and of the Christian doctrine,
that he might know CHRIST JESUs, to know whom
is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all
these things, a secret joy ran through every part
of my soul, and I frequently rejoiced that ever I
was brought to this place, which I had often
thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that
could possibly have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the re-
mainder of my time; and the conversation which
employed the hours between Friday and me was
such as made the three years which we lived there
together perfectly and completely happy, if any
such thing as complete happiness can be found in
a sublunary state. The savage was now a good
Christian, a much better than I; though I have
X 2.
reason to hope, and bless GoD for it, that we were
equally penitent, and comforted restored peni-
tents: we had here the word of GoD to read, and
no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than if we
had been in England.
I always applied myself to reading the Scripture,
and to let him know, as well as I could, the mean-
ing of what I read; and he again by his serious
inquiries and questions, made me, as I said before,
a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge,
than I should ever have been by my own private
reading: another thing I cannot refrain from ob-
serving here also, from experience, in this retired
part of my life; viz. how infinite and inexpres-
sible a blessing it is, that the knowledge of God,
and of the doctrine of salvation by CHRIST Jesus,
is so plainly laid down in the word of God, so
easy to be received and understood, that as the
bare reading the Scripture made me capable of un-
derstanding enough of my duty to carry me di-
rectly on to the great work of sincere repentance
for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life
and salvation, to a stated reformation in practice,
and obedience to all God’s commands, and this
without any teacher or instructor, (I mean hu-
man) so the plain instruction sufficiently served
to the enlightening this savage creature, and
bringing him to be such a Christian as I have
known few equal to him in my life. -
As to the disputes, wranglings, strife and con-
tention, which has happened in the world about
religion, whether niceties in doctrines, or schemes
of church government, they were all perfectly
useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they
have been to all the rest in the world: we had
the sure guide to heaven, viz. the word of God;
and we had, blessed be GoD ! comfortable views of
the Spirit of God, teaching and instructing us by
his word, leading us into all truth, and making us
both willing and obedient to the instruction of
his word: and I cannot see the least use that the
greatest knowledge of the disputed points in reli-
gion, which have made such confusions in the
world, would have been to us, if we could have
obtained it.—But I must go on with the historical
part of things, and take every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almost all
I said to him, and speak fluently, though in bro-
ken English, to me, I acquainted him with my
own story, or at least so much of it as related to
my coming into the place; how I had lived there,
and how long. I let him into the mystery (for
such it was to him) of gunpowder and bullets, and
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with ; and I
made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as
in England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog,
instead of an hanger, I gave him an hatchet, which
was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon many occasions.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
e
-
X 3
particularly England, which I came from ; how we
lived, how we worshipped GoD, how we behaved
to one another, and how we traded in ships to all
the parts of the world. I gave him an account of
the wreck which I had been on board of, and
shewed him, as near as I could, the place where
she lay; but she was all beaten in pieces long be-
fore, and quite gone.
I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we
lost when we escaped, and which I could not stir
with my whole strength then, but was now fallen
almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Fri-
day stood musing a great while, and said nothing;
I asked him what it was he studied upon 2 At last,
says he, Me see such boat like come to place at my
nation.
I did not understand him a good while; but at
last, when I had examined further into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived,
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. I presently imagined that some
European ship must have been cast away upon
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and drive
ashore; but was so dull, that I never once thought
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much
less whence they might come; so I only inquired
after a description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough;
but brought me better to understand him, when
he added, with some warmth, We save the white
>
mans from drown: then I presently asked him,
if there were any white mans, as he called them,
in the boat? Yes, he said, the boat full of white
mans. I asked him, how many 2 he told upon his
fingers seventeen. I asked him then, what became
of them 2 he told me, They live, they dwell at my
nation. w -
This put new thoughts into my head again; for
I presently imagined, that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that was cast away in sight
of my island, as I now call it: and who, after the
ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her in-
evitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat,
and were landed upon that wild shore among the
savages.
Upon this I inquired of him more critically,
what was become of them He assured me they
lived still there, that they had been there about four
years, that the savages let them alone, and gave
them victuals to eat. I asked him, how it came
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them? he
said, No, they make brother with them : that is, as
I understood him, a truce: and then he added,
They eat no mans but when make the war fight:
that is to say, they never eat any men, but such
as come to fight with them, and are taken in
battle.
It was after this some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence, as I have said, I had in a
clear day discovered the main or continent of Ame-
x 4
rica; Friday, the weather being very serene, looks
very earnestly towards the main land, and in a
kind of surprise falls a jumping and dancing, and
calls out to me, for I was at some distance from
him. I asked him what was the matter Ojoy,
says he, O glad there see my country, there my
nation
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure
appeared in his face, and his eyes sparkled, and
his countenance discovered a strange eagerness, as
if he had a mind to be in his own country again;
and this observation of mine put a great many
thoughts into me; which made me at first not so
easy about my new man Friday as I was before;
and I made no doubt, but that if Friday could get
back to his own nation again, he would not only
forget all his religion, but all his obligations to
me; and would be forward enough to give his
countrymen an account of me, and come back per-
haps with an hundred or two of them, and make
a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry
as he used to be with those of his enemies, when
they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which I was very sorry afterwards:
however, as my jealousy increased, and held me
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before ; in which
I was certainly in the wrong too, the honest
grateful creature having no thought about it, but
what consisted of the best principles, both as a
religious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as ap-
peared afterwards, to my full satisfaction.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be
sure I was every day pumping him, to see if he
would discover any of the new thoughts which I
suspected were in him; but I found every thing he
said was so honest, and so innocent, that I could
find nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite
of all my uneasiness, he made me at last entirely
his own again; nor did he in the least perceive
that I was uneasy; and therefore I could not sus-
pect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at sea, so that we could not see
the continent, I called to him, and said, Friday,
do not you wish yourself in your own country,
your own nation ? Yes, he said, I be much O glad
to be at my own nation. What would you do
there said I: would you turn wild again, eat
men's flesh again: and be a savage as you were be-
fore ? He looked full of concern, and shaking his
head, said, No, no, Friday tell them to live good,
tell them to pray GoD, tell them to eat corn-bread,
cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man again. Why then,
said I to him, they will kill you. He looked
grave at that, and then said, No, they no kill me,
they willing love learn : he meant by this, they
would be willing to learn. He added, they learned
much of the bearded mans that came in the boat.
Then I asked him, if he would go back to them?
He smiled at that, and told me he could not swim
so far. I told him I would make a canoe for him.
He told me he would go, if I would go with him.
I go said I, why they will eat me if I come
there. No, no, says he, Me make them no eat
you, me make them much love you: he meant he
would tell them how I had killed his enemies and
saved his life, and so he would make them love me.
Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind
they were to seventeen white men, or bearded
men, as he called them, who came on shore in dis-
treSS.
From this time, I confess, I had a mind to
venture over, and see if I could possibly join with
these bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were
Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but if I
could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good com-
pany together, better than I could from an island
forty miles off the shore, and alone without help.
So, after some days, I took Friday to work again,
by way of discourse; and told him, I would give
him a boat to go back to his own nation; and ac-
cordingly I carried him to my frigate, which lay
on the other side of the island; and having cleared
it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water),
I brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went
into it.
I found he was a most dexterous fellow at ma-
maging it; he would make it go almost as swift and
fast again as I could ; so when he was in, I said
to him, Well now, Friday, shall we go to your
mation ? He looked very dull at my saying so,
which it seems, was because he thought the boat
too small to go so far. I told him then I had a
bigger: so the next day I went to the place where
the first boat lay which I had made, but which I
could not get into the water; he said that was big
enough; but then, as I had taken no care of it,
and it had lain two or three-and-twenty years
there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was
in a manner rotten. Friday told me, such a boat
would do very well, and would carry much
‘ enough vittle, drink, bread;’ that was his way of
talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed
upon my design of going over with him to the con-
tinent, that I told him we would go and make one
as big as that, and he should go home in it. He
answered not one word, but looked very grave and
sad. I asked him, what was the matter with him?
He asked me again thus, Why you angry mad
with Friday? what me done I asked him what
he meant? I told him I was not angry with him
at all. No angry, no angry! says he, repeating the
word several times. Why send Friday home away
to my nation ? Why, said I, Friday, did you not say
you wished you were there? Yes, yes, says he,
wish be both there; no wish Friday there, no
master there. In a word, he would not think of
going there without me. I go there, Friday! said
I, what should I do there He turned very quick
upon me at this. You do great deal much good,
says he, you teach wild mans be good, sober, tame
mans; you tell them know God, pray God, and
live new life. Alas, Friday, said I, thou knowest
not what thou sayest; I am but an ignorant man
myself. Yes, yes, says he, you teechee me good,
you teechee them good. No, no, Friday, said I,
you shall go without me; leave me here to live
by myself, as I did before. He looked confused
again at that word, and running to one of the hat-
chets which he used to wear, he takes it up has-
tily, and gives it me. What must I do with this 2
said I to him. You take kill Friday, says he.
What must I kill you for? said I again. He re-
turns very quick, What you send Friday away for 2
Take kill Friday, no send Friday away. This he
spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the ut-
most affection in him to me, and a firm resolution
in him, that I told him then, and often after, that
I would never send him away from me, if he was
willing to stay with me. -
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse
a settled affection to me, and that nothing should
part him from me, so I found all the foundation of
his desire to go to his own country was laid in his
ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my
doing them good ; a thing which as I had no no-
tion of myself, so I had not the least thought, or
intention, or desire of undertaking it: but still I
found a strong inclination to my attempting an es-
cape, as above, founded on the supposition ga-

thered from the former discourse; viz. that there
were seventeen bearded men there : and therefore,
without any delay, I went to work with Friday, to
find out a great tree proper to fell, and make a
large periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage.
There were trees enough in the island to have
built a little fleet, not of periaguas and canoes
only, but even of good large vessels: but the
main thing I looked at, was to get one so near
the water, that we might launch it when it
was made, to avoid the mistake I committed at
first. -
At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found
he knew much better than I what kind of wood
was fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what
wood to call the tree we cut down, except that it
was very like the tree we call fustic, or between
that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was much of
the same colour and smell. Friday was for burning
the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to make it
into a boat; but I shewed him how rather to cut it
out with tools, which after I shewed him how to
use, he did very handily; and in about a month’s
hard labour we finished it, and made it very hand.
some, especially when, with our axes, which I
shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed the
outside into the true shape of a boat. After this,
however, it cost us near a fortnight's time to
get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon
great rollers into the water: but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men with great ease.
When she was in the water, and though she
was so big, it amazed me to see with what dexte-
rity and how swift my man Friday could manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along ; so I asked
him if he would go, and if we might venture over
in her? Yes, he said, he venture over in her very
well, though great blow wind: however, I had a
farther design that he knew nothing of, and that
was to make a mast and sail, and to fit her with an
anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy
enough to get; so I pitched upon a straight young
cedar-tree, which I found near the place, and
which there was a great plenty of in the island;
and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave
him directions how to shape and order it: but as
to the sail, that was my particular care; I knew I
had old sails or rather pieces of old sails enough;
but as I had had them now twenty-six years by me,
and had not been very careful to preserve them,
not imagining that I should ever have this kind of
use for them, I did not doubt but they were all
rotten; and indeed most of them were so: however,
I found two pieces which appeared pretty good,
and with these I went to work, and with a great
deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you
may be sure) for want of needles, I at length made
a three-cornered ugly thing, like what we call in
England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a
boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top,
such as usually our ships long-boats sail with, and
such as I best knew how to manage; because it was
such a one as I used in the boat in which I made
my escape from Barbary, as related in the first part
of my story.
I was near two months performing this last
work; viz. rigging and fitting my mast and sails;
for I finished them very complete, making a
small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to assist, if
we should turn to windward; and, which was more
than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her, to
steer with ; and though I was but a bungling ship-
wright, yet, as I knew the usefulness, and even ne-
cessity of such a thing, I applied myself with so
much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to
pass, though, considering the many dull contri-
vances I had for it that failed, I think it cost me
almost as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for though he knew very well how to paddle
the canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a
sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when
he saw me work the boat to-and-again in the sea
by the rudder, and how the sail gybed, and filled
this way or that way, as the course we sailed
changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like
one astonished and amazed; however, with a little
use, I made all these things familiar to him, and
he became an expert sailor, except that as to the
compass I could make him understand very little
of that: on the other hand, as there was very little
cloudy weather, and seldom or never any fogs in
those parts, there was the less occasion for a com-
pass, seeing the stars were always to be seen by
night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy
seasons; and then nobody cared to stir abroad,
either by land or sea. -
I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth
year of my captivity in this place; though the three
last years that I had this creature with me ought
rather to be left out of the account, my habita-
tion being quite of another kind than in all the
rest of my time. I kept the anniversary of my
landing here with the same thankfulness to God
for his mercies as at first; and if I had such cause
of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so
now, having such additional testimonies of the care
of Providence over me, and the great hopes I had
of being effectually and speedily delivered; for I
had an invincible impression upon my thoughts,
that my deliverance was at hand, and that J
should not be another year in this place: how.
ever, I went on with my husbandry, digging,
planting, and fencing, as usual; I gathered and
cured my grapes, and did every necessary thing, as
before.
The rainy season was in the meantime upon me,
when I kept more within doors than at other times;
so I had stowed our new vessel as secure as we
could, bringing her up into the creek, where, as I
said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship; and haling her up to the shore, at high-water
*
mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock,
just big enough for her to floatin; and then, when
the tide was out, we made a strong dam cross the
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay
dry, as to the tide, from the sea; and to keep the
rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees so
thick, that she was as well thatched as an house;
and thus we waited for the months of November
and December, in which I designed to make my
adventure. ... "
When the settled season began to come in, as
the thought of my design returned with the fair
weather, I was preparing daily for the voyage;
and the first thing I did was to lay up a certain
quantity of provision, being the store for the voy-
age; and intended, in a week or a fortnight's time,
to open the dock, and launch out our boat. I was
busy one morning upon something of this kind,
when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the
sea-shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tor-
toise, a thing which we generally got once a week,
for the sake of the eggs, as well as the flesh. Fri-
day had not been long gone, when he came run-
ning back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the
steps he set his feet on ; and before I had time to
speak to him, he cried out to me, O master! O
master! O sorrow ! O bad | What’s the matter,
Friday 2 said I. Oyonder there, says he, one, two,
three, canoe! one, two, three | By this way of
speaking I concluded there were six; but on en-
VOL. I. Y
quiry I found there were but three. Well, Friday,
said I, do not be frighted; so I heartened him up
as well as I could. However, I saw the poor fel-
low most terribly scared; for nothing ran in his
head but that they were come to look for him, and
would cut him in pieces, and eat him; the poor
fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do
with him: I comforted him as well as I could,
and told him I was in as much danger as he, and
that they would eat me as well as him: but, said I,
Friday, we must resolve to fight them : Can you
fight, Friday? Me shoot, says he, but there come
many great number. No matter for that, said I
again, our guns will fright them that we do not
kill. So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to
defend him, he would defend me, and stand by
me, and do just as Ibade him P. He said, Me die,
when you bid die, master; so I went and fetched
a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had been
so good an husband of my rum, that I had a great
deal left: when he had drank it, I made him take
the two fowling-pieces which we always carried,
and load them with large swan-shot as big as small
pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded
them with two slugs, and five small bullets each;
and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets
each: I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by
my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective-glass, and went up to the side of the
hill, to see what I could discover; and I found
quickly, by my glass, that there were one-and-twenty
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes; and
that their whole business seemed to be the trium-
phant banquet upon these three human bodies; a
barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than as I
had observed was usual with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his escape, but
nearer to my creek, where the shore was low, and
where a thick wood came close almost down to
the sea : this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman
errand these wretches came about, so filled me with
indignation, that I came down again to Friday,
and told him, I was resolved to go down to them,
and kill them all; and asked him if he would stand
by me. He was now gotten over his fright, and
his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had
given him, he was very cheerful; and told me, as
before, he would die when I bid die.
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the
arms which I had charged, as before, between us;
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pis-
tol, and the other three myself; and in this posture
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more
powder and bullets; and as to orders, I charged
him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, shoot,
or do any thing till I bid him; and in the mean-
time, not to speak a word: in this posture I fetched
a compass to my right hand of near a mile, as well
Y 2
to get over the creek as to get into the wood; so
that I might come within shot of them before I
could be discovered, which I had seen by my glass
it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, my former
thoughts returning, I began to abate my resolu-
tion; I do not mean, that I entertained any fear
of their number; for as they were naked, unarmed
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them; nay,
though I had been alone: but it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion, much less
what necessity I was in, to go and dip my hands
in blood, to attack people who had neither done
or intended me any wrong; who, as to me, were
innocent, and whose barbarous customs were their
own disaster, being in them a token indeed of
GoD's having left them, with the other nations of
that part of the world, to such stupidity and to
such inhuman courses; but did not call me to take
upon me to be a judge of their actions, much less
an executioner of his justice; that whenever he
thought fit, he would take the cause into his own
hands, and by national vengeance punish them for
national crimes; but that in the meantime, it was
none of my business: that it was true, Friday might
justify it, because he was a declared enemy, and in
a state of war with those very particular people, and
it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to me. These things
were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the
way as I went, that I resolved I would only go
place myself near them, that I might observe their
barbarous feast, and that I would act then as GoD
should direct; but that unless something offered
that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I
would not meddle with them. - -
With this resolution I entered the wood, and
with all possible wariness and silence (Friday fol-
lowing close at my heels) I marched till I came
to the skirt of the wood, on the side which was
next to them; only that one corner of the wood
lay between me and them: here I called softly to
Friday, and shewing him a great tree, which was
just at the corner of the wood, I bade him go to
the tree, and bring me word if he could see there
plainly what they were doing : he did so, and
came immediately back to me, and told me they
might be plainly viewed there; that they were all
about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their pri-
soners; and that another lay bound upon the sand,
a little from them, whom he said they would kill
next, and which fired the very soul within me.
He told me, it was not one of their nation, but
one of the bearded men whom he had told me of,
who came to their country in the boat. I was
filled with horror at the very naming the white-
bearded man, and, going to the tree, I saw plainly,
by my glass, a white man, who lay upon the beach
of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with flags,
or things like rushes; and that he was an European,
and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket be-
Y 3
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the
place where I was, which, by going a little way
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and
that then I should be within half shot of them; so
I withheld my passion, though I was indeed en-
raged to the highest degree: and going back about
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and
then I came to a little rising ground, which gave
me a full view of them, at the distance of about
eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen
of the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground all
close huddled together, and had just sent the other
two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him,
perhaps limb by limb, to their fire; and they were
stooped down to untie the bands at his feet. I
turned to Friday; Now, Friday, said I, do as Ibid
thee. Friday said, he would. Then, Friday, said
I, do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing.
So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling-
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by
his ; and with the other musket I took my aim at
the savages, bidding him do the like. Then ask-
ing him if he was ready, he said, Yes. Then fire
at them, said I; and the same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the side that he shot, he killed two of them,
and wounded three more; and on my side, I killed
one, and wounded two. They were, you may be
sure, in a dreadful consternation: and all of them,
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet im-
mediately, but did not know which way to run, or
which way to look; for they knew not from whence
their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close
upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe
what I did; so as soon as the first shot was made,
I threw down the piece, and took up the fowling-
piece, and Friday did the like: he sees me cock,
and present; he did the same again. Are you
ready, Friday? said I. Yes, says he. Let fly then,
said I, in the name of God; and with that I fired
again among the amazed wretches, and so did
Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden with
what I called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we
found only two drop; but so many were wounded,
that they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, all bloody, and miserably wounded most
of them; whereof three more fell quickly after,
though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, said I, laying down the discharged
pieces, and taking up the musket, which was yet
loaden, follow me, said I; which he did, with a
deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the
wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot: as soon as I perceived they saw me, Ishouted
as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so too; and
running as fast as I could, which by the way was
not very fast, being loaded with arms as I was, I
made directly towards the poor victim, who was,
as I said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between
the place where they sat and the sea; the two
Y 4
butchers, who were just going to work with him,
had left him, at the surprise of our first fire, and
fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and had
jumped into a canoe, and three more of the rest
made the same way: I turned to Friday, and bade
him step forwards, and fire at them; he understood
me immediately, and running about forty yards to
be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he
had killed them all; for I saw them all fall on an
heap into the boat, though I saw two of them up
again quickly: however, he killed two of them,
and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat, as if he had been dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled
out my knife, and cut the flags that bound the
poor victim; and loosing his hands and feet I
lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese
tongue, what he was 2 He answered in Latin,
Christianus; but was so weak and faint, that he
could scarce stand, or speak; I took my bottle out
of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that
he should drink, which he did ; and I gave him a
piece of bread, which he eat; then I asked him,
what countryman he was? and he said, Espagnole;
and, being a little recovered, let me know, by all
the signs he could possibly make, how much he
was in my debt for his deliverance. Seignior, said
I, with as much Spanish as I could make up, we
will talk afterwards, but we must fight now: if
you have any strength left, take this pistol and
sword, and lay about you : he took them very
thankfully, and no sooner had he the arms in his
hands, but as if they had put new vigour into him,
he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had
cut two of them in pieces in an instant; for the
truth is, as the whole was a surprise to them, so the
poor creatures were so much frighted with the
noise of our pieces, that they fell down for mere
amazement and fear, and had no more power to
attempt their own escape, than their flesh had to
resist our shot; and that was the case of those five
that Friday shot in the boat; for as three of them
fell with the hurt they received, so the other two
fell with the fright. . a'
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing,
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I
had given the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so
I called to Friday, and bade him run up to the
tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms
which lay there, that had been discharged, which
he did with great swiftness; and then giving him
my musket, I sat down myself to load all the rest
again, and bade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there
happened a fierce engagement between the Spa-
niard and one of the savages, who made at him
with one of their great wooden swords, the same
weapon that was to have killed him before, if I
had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as
bold and as brave as could be imagined, though
weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had
cut him two great wounds on his head; but the
savage, being a stout lusty fellow, closing in with
him, had thrown him down (being faint), and was
wringing my sword out of his hand, when the
Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting his
sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the
savage through the body, and killed him upon the
spot, before I, who was running to help, could come
near him. -
Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that he dispatched those three,
who, as I said before, were wounded at first, and
fallen, and all the rest he could come up with; and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling pieces, with which he pursued
two of the savages, and wounded them both; but
as he was not able to run, they both got from him
into the wood, where Friday pursued them, and
killed one of them ; but the other was too nimble
for him; and though he was wounded, yet he
plunged into the sea, and swam with all his might
off to those who were left in the canoe, which three
in the canoe, with one wounded, who we know not
whether he died or no, were all that escaped our
hands of one-and-twenty. The account of the rest
is as follows:
3 Killed at our shot from the tree.
2 Killed at the next shot.
2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.
1 Killed by ditto, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropped here and there
of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his
chace of them. .
4 Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded,
if not dead.
21 in all.
Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to
get out of gun-shot; and though Friday made two
or three shot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them. Friday would fain have had me take
one of their canoes, and pursue them; and indeed
I was very anxious about their escape, lest carry-
ing the news home to their people, they should
come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of
their canoes, and devour us by mere multitudes;
so I consented to pursue them by sea; and running
to one of their canoes, I jumped in, and bade
Friday follow me; but when I was in the canoe, I
was surprised to find another poor creature lie there
alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was,
for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not
knowing what the matter was; for he had not been
able to look up over the side of the boat, he was
tied so hard, neck and heels, and had been tied so
long, that he had really little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes,
which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up ; but he could not stand, or speak,
but groaned most piteously, believing, it seems,
still, that he was only unbound in order to be
killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered,
revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when
Friday came to hear him speak, and looked in his
face, it would have moved any one to tears, to have
seen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hug-
ged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about,
danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head, and then sung and
jumped about again like a distracted creature. It
was a good while before I could make him speak
to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when
he came a little to himself, he told me that it was
his father.
It was not easy for me to express how it moved
me, to see what ecstasy and filial affection had
worked in this poor savage, at the sight of his fa-
ther, and of his being delivered from death; nor
indeed can I describe half the extravagancies of his
affection after this ; for he went into the boat and
out of the boat a great many times: when he went
in to him, he would sit down by him, open his breast,
and hold his father's head close to his bosom half
an hour together, to nourish it; then he took his
arms and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with
the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his
hands; and I, perceiving what the case was, gave
him some rum out of my bottle to rub them with,
which did them a great deal of good.
This action put an end to our pursuit of the
canoe with the other savages, who were now gotten
almost out of sight; and it was happy for us that
we did not; for it blew so hard within two hours
after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night,
and that from the north-west, which was against
them, that I could not suppose their boat could live,
or that they ever reached to their own coast.
But to return to Friday; he was so busy about
his father, that I could not find in my heart to take
him off for some time: but after I thought he could
leave him a little, I called him to me, and he came
jumping and laughing, and pleased to the highest
extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his
father any bread 2 He shook his head, and said,
None: ugly dog eat all up self. So I gave him a
cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried on
purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but
he would not taste it, but carried it to his father.
I had in my pocket also two or three bunches of
my raisins, so I gave him a handful of them for
his father. He had no sooner given his father
these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat,
and run away as if he had been bewitched. He ran
at such a rate (for he was the swiftest fellow of
his feet that ever I saw), I say, he ran at such a rate,
that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant;
and though I called and hallooed too after him, it
was all one; away he went, and in a quarter of an
hour I saw him come back again, though not so
fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found
his pace was slacker, because he had something in
his hand. -
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
father some fresh water; and that he had got two
more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me, but the water he carried to his father: how-
ever, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup
of it: this water revived his father more than all
the rum or spirits I had given him; for he was just
fainting with thirst.
When his father had drank, I called him, to
know if there was any water left; he said, Yes; and
Ibade him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in
as much want of it as his father; and I sent one
of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been
tied with : when I saw that upon Friday's coming
to him with the water, he sat up and drank, and
took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him,
and gave him an handful of raisins; he looked up
in my face, with all the tokens of gratitude and
thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon
his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but
was really not able, his ankles were so swelled and
so painful to him; so Ibade him sit still, and caused
Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum,
as he had done his father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about, to see if his father was
in the same place and posture as he left him
sitting; and at last he found he was not to be .
seen; at which he started up, and, without speak-
ing a word, flew with that swiftness to him, that
one could scarce perceive his feet to touch the
ground as he went: but when he came, he only
found he had laid himself down to ease his limbs:
so Friday came back to me presently, and I then
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up,
if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would
take care of him: but Friday, a lusty young fellow,
took the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and car-
ried him away to the boat, and set him down softly
upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his
feet in the inside of it, and then lifted them quite
in, and set him close to his father, and presently
stepping out again, launched the boat off, and
paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk,
though the wind blew pretty hard too; so he
brought them both safe into our creek; and leav-
ing them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other
canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and
asked him, whither he went? He told me, Go
fetch more boat; so away he went like the wind;
for sure never man or horse ran like him, and he
had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as
I got to it by land; so he wafted me over, and
then went to help our new guests out of the boat,
which he did; but they were neither of them
able to walk; so that poor Friday knew not what
to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thºught,
and calling to Friday to bid them sit down on the
bank while he came to me, Isoqn made a kind of
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I car-
ried them up both together upon it between us;
but when we got them to the outside of our wall or
fortification, we were at a worse loss than before ;
for it was impossible to get them over; and I was
resolved not to break it down : so I set to work
again; and Friday and I, in about two hours time,
made a very handsome tent, covered with old sails,
and above that with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and between that
and the grove of young wood which I had planted:
and here we made two beds of such things as I
had ; viz. of good rice-straw, with blankets laid
upon it to lie on, and another to cover them on
each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I thought my-
self very rich in subjects; and it was a merry re-
flection which I frequently made, how like a king

I looked: first of all the whole country was my own
mere property; so that I had an undoubted right
of dominion; 2dly, My people were perfectly sub-
jected. I was absolute lord and lawgiver; they
all owed their lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their lives, if there had been oceasion for it,
for me: it was remarkable too, I had but three
subjects, and they were of three different religions.
My man Friday was a protestant, his father a pagan
and a cannibal; and the Spaniard was a papist:
however, I allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions: but this by the way.
As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued
prisoners, and given them shelter, and a place to
rest them upon, I began to think of making some
provision for them; and the first thing I did, I
ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a
kid and a goat, out of my particular flock, to be
killed : then I cut off the hind quarter, and, chop-
ping it into small pieces, I set Friday to work to
boiling and stewing, and made them a very good
dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; having put
some barley and rice also into the broth, and as I
cooked it without doors (for I made no fire within
my inner wall) so I carried it all into the new
tent; and having set a table there for them, I sat
down and eat my dinner also with them; and, as
well as I could, cheered them and encouraged
them, Friday being my interpreter, especially to his
father, and indeed to the Spaniard too; for the Spa-
niard spoke the language of the savages pretty well.
VOL. I. Z
After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our musquets and other fire-arms, which, for want
of time, we had left upon the place of battle; and
the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun,
and would presently be offensive; and I also ordered
him to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous
feast, which I knew were pretty much, and which
I could not think of doing myself; nay, I could
not bear to see them, if I went that way; all which
he punctually performed, and defaced the very ap-
pearance of the savages being there; so that when
I went again, I could scarce know where it was,
otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing
to the place.
I then began to enter into a little conversation
with my two new subjects; and first I set Friday
to inquire of his father, what he thought of the
escape of the savages in that canoe? and whether
he might expect a return of them with a power
too great for us to resist? His first opinion was,
that the savages in the boat never could live out
the storm which blew that night they went off,
but must of necessity be drowned or driven south
to those other shores, where they were as sure to
be devoured, as they were to be drowned if they
were cast away; but as to what they would do if
they came safe on shore, he said he knew not: but
it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully
frighted with the manner of being attacked, the
noise, and the fire, that he believed they would
tell their people they were all killed by thunder
and lightning, and not by the hand of man; and
that the two which appeared (viz. Friday and I)
were two heavenly spirits or furies come down to
destroy them, and not men with weapons. This,
he said, he knew, because he heard them cry out
so in their language to one another; for it was im-
possible for them to conceive that a man should
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance,
without lifting up the hand, as was done now.
And this old savage was in the right, for, as J un-
derstood since by other hands, the savages of that
part never attempted to go over to the island after-
wards. They were so terrified with the accounts
given by these four men (for it seems they did
escape the sea), that they believed whoever went
to that enchanted island would be destroyed with
fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was
under continual apprehensions for a good while,
and kept always upon my guard, I and all my
army; for as there were now four of us, I would
have ventured upon an hundred of them fairly in
the open field at any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes ap-
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I
began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to
the main into consideration, being likewise as-
sured by Friday's father, that I might depend upon
good usage from their nation on his account, if I
would go.
Z 2
But my thoughts were a little suspended, when
I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and
when I understood, that there were sixteen more
of his countrymen and Portuguese, who having
been cast away, and made their escape to that side,
lived there at peace indeed with the savages, but
were very sore put to it for necessaries, and indeed
for life. I asked him all the particulars of their
voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship
bound from the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna,
being directed to leave their loading there, which
was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring back
what European goods they could meet with there;
that they had five Portuguese seamen on board,
whom they took out of another wreck; that five
of their own men were drowned when first the ship
was lost; and that these escaped through infinite
dangers and hazards, and arrived almost starved on
the Cannibal coast, where they expected to have
been devoured every moment. -
He told me, they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that they had neither
powder or ball, the washing of the sea having
spoiled all their powder, but a little which they
used at their first landing to provide themselves
some food. . -
I asked him what he thought would become of
them there; and if they had formed no design of
making any escape He said, they had many con-
sultations about it; but that having neither vessel,
nor tools to build one, or provisions of any
kind, their counsels always ended in tears and
despair. - - -
I asked him, how he thought they would receive
a proposal from me, which might tend towards an
escape; and whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill usage of me, if I put
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no
inherent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men
always square their dealings by the obligations they
had received, so much as they did by the advan-
tages they expected. I told him, it would be very
hard, that I should be the instrument of their deli-
verance, and that they should afterwards make me
their prisoner in New Spain, where an Englishman
was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity,
or what accident soever, brought him thither; and
that I had rather be delivered up to the savages,
and be devoured alive, than fall into the merciless
claws of the priests, and be carried into the inqui-
sition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded,
if they were all here, we might, with so many
hands, build a bark large enough to carry us all
away either to the Brasils southward, or to the
islands or Spanish coast northward: but that if in
requital they should, when I had put weapons into
their hands, carry me by force among their own
people, I might be ill used for my kindness to them,
and make my case worse than it was before.
He answered, with a great deal of candour and
ingenuity, that their condition was so miserable,
z 3
and they were so sensible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the thought of using any man
unkindly that should contribute to their deliver-
ance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them
with the old man, and discourse with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their answer:
that he would make conditions with them upon
their solemn oath, that they would be absolutely
under my leading, as their commander and captain;
and that they should swear upon the holy sacra-
ments and gospel, to be true to me, and go to such
christian country as I should agree to, and no
other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely
by my orders, till they were landed safely in such
country as I intended; and that he would bring a
contract from them under their hands for that
purpose.
Then he told me, he would first swear to me
himself, that he would never stir from me as long
as he lived, till I gave him order; and that he
would take my side to the last drop of blood, if
there should happen the least breach of faith among
his countrymen.
He told me, they were all of them very civil
honest men, and they were under the greatest dis-
tress imaginable, having neither weapons or clothes,
nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of
the savages; out of all hopes of ever returning to
their own country; and that he was sure, if I
would undertake their relief, they would live and
die by me.
/
Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to
relieve them, if possible, and to send the old savage
and this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when
he had gotten all things in readiness to go, the
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had
so much prudence in it on one hand, and so much
sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice,
put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least
half a year. The case was thus:
He had been with us now about a month; dur-
ing which time I had let him see in what manner
I had provided, with the assistance of Providence,
for my support; and he saw evidently what stock
of corn and rice I had lain up; which, as it was
more than sufficient for myself, so it was not suf.
ficient, at least without good husbandry, for my
family, now it was increased to number four: but
much less would it be sufficient, if his country-
men, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive,
should come over; and least of all would it be suf-
ficient to victual our vessel, if we should build
one, for a voyage to any of the christian colonies
of America. So he told me, he thought it would
be more adviseable, to let him and the other two
dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I
could spare seed to sow; and that we should wait
another harvest, that we might have a supply of
corn for his countrymen when they should come ;
for want might be a temptation to them to disa-
gree, or not to think themselves delivered, other-
Z 4
wise than out of one difficulty into another. You
know, says he, the children of Israel, though they
rejoiced at first at their being delivered out of
Egypt, yet rebelled even against God himself, that
delivered them, when they came to want bread in
the wilderness. -
His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so
good, that I could not but be very well pleased
with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied with
his fidelity: so we fell to digging, all four of us,
as well as the wooden tools we were furnished
with permitted; and in about a month's time, by
the end of which it was seed-time, we had gotten
as much land cured and trimmed up as we sowed
twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars
of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had
to spare ; nor indeed did we leave ourselves barley
sufficient for our own food for the six months that
we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckoning
from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for
it is not to be supposed it is six months in the
ground in that country. -
Having now society enough, and our number
being sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages,
if they had come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island,
wherever we found occasion ; and as here we had
our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it
was impossible, at least for me, to have the means
of it out of mine; to this purpose, I marked out
several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and
I set Friday and his father to cutting them down;
and then I caused the Spaniard, to whom I im-
parted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee and
direct their work: I shewed them with what inde-
fatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single
planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they
had made about a dozen large planks of good oak,
near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from
two inches to four inches thick: what prodigious
labour it took up, any one may imagine.
At the same time I contrived to increase my
little flock of tame goats as much as I could; and
to this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard to
go out one day, and myself, with Friday, the next
day, for we took our turns: and by this means we
got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest: for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the
kids, and added them to our flock: but, above all,
the season for curing the grapes coming on, I
caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up
in the sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicant,
where the raisins of the sun are cured, we should
have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with
our bread, was a great part of our food, and very
good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceed-
ing nourishing food.
It was now harvest, and our crop in good order:
it was not the most plentiful increase I had seen
in the island, but, however, it was enough to an-
swer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of
barley, we brought in and threshed out above two
hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in pro-
portion of the rice, which was store enough for
our food to the next harvest, though all the six-
teen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if
we had been ready for a voyage, it would very
plentifully have victualled our ship, to have car-
ried us to any part of the world, that is to say, of
America. When we had thus housed and secured
our magazine of corn, we fell to work, to make
more wicker-work; viz. great baskets, in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that
I did not make some things for defence of this
kind of work: but I saw no need of it. And now,
having a full supply of food for all the guests ex-
pected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to
the main, to see what he could do with those he
left behind him there. I gave him a strict charge
in writing not to bring any man with him, who
would not first swear, in the presence of himself
and of the old savage, that he would no way in-
jure, fight with, or attack the person he should
find in the island, who was so kind to send for
them in order to their deliverance; but that they
would stand by and defend him against all such
attempts; and wherever they went, would be en-
tirely under, and subjected to his command; and
that this should be put in writing, and signed with
their hands: how we were to have this done, when
I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed
was a question which we never asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the
old savage (the father of Friday) went away in
one of the canoes, which they might be said to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
prisoners to be devoured by the savages.
I gave each of them a musket with a firelock
on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball,
charging them to be very good husbands of both,
and not to use either of them but upon urgent oc-
casions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first mea-
sures used by me in view of my deliverance for
now 27 years and some days; I gave them provi-,
sions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for
themselves for many days, and sufficient for their
countrymen for about eight days time; and wish-
ing them a good voyage, I let them go, agreeing
with them about a signal they should hang out at
their return, by which I should know them again,
when they came back, at a distance, before they
came on shore.
They went away with a fair gale on the day
that the moon was at the full; by my account in
the month of October; but as for the exact reck-
oning of days, after I had once lost it, I could
never recover it again; nor had I kept even the
number of years so punctually, as to be sure that
I was right, though, as it proved when I after-
wards examined my account, I found I had kept
a true reckoning of years.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of
in history. I was fast asleep in my hutch one
morning, when my man Friday came running in
to me, and called aloud, Master, master, they are
come, they are come.
... I jumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went
out as soon as I could get my clothes on, through
my little grove, which (by the way) was by this
time grown to be a very thick wood; I say, re-
gardless of danger, I went without my arms, which
was not my custom to do; but I was surprised,
when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw
a boat at about a league and a half’s distance,
standing in for the shore, with a shoulder of mutton
sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty
fair to bring them in ; also I observed presently,
that they did not come from that side which the
shore lay on, but from the southermost end of the
island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him
lie close, for these were not the people we looked
for, and that we did not know yet whether they
were friends or enemies.
. . In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspec-
tive glass, to see what I could make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the
top of the hill, as I used to do when I was appre-
hensive of any thing, and to take my view the
plainer without being discovered.
I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at an anchor,
at about two leagues and a half’s distance from
me, S. S. E., but not above a league and a half
from the shore. By my observation it appeared
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat appear-
ed to be an English long-boat.
I cannot express the confusion I was in, though
the joy of seeing a ship, and one whom I had rea-
son to believe was manned by my own country-
men, and consequently friends, was such as I can-
not describe; but yet I had some secret doubts
hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they
came, bidding me keep upon my guard. In the
first place it occurred to me to consider what busi-
ness an English ship could have in that part of the
world; since it was not the way to or from any
part of the world where the English had any traf.
fick; and I knew there had been no storms to drive
them in there, as in distress; and if they were
English really, it was most probable that they
were here upon no good design; and that I had
better continue as I was, than fall into the hands
of thieves and murderers. - -
Let no man despise the secret hints and notices
of danger, which sometimes are given him when
he may think there is no possibility of its being
real. That such hints and notices are given us,
I believe few that have made any observations of
things can deny ; that they are certain discoveries
of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we
cannot doubt; and if the tendency of them seems
to be to warn us of danger, why should we not
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whe-
ther supreme, or inferior and subordinate, is not
the question), and that they are given for our
good? *
The present question abundantly confirms me in
the justice of this reasoning; for had I not been
made cautious by this secret admonition, come
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably,
and in a far worse condition than before, as you will
see presently.
I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I
saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thrust in at for the convenience of
landing; however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I
formerly landed my rafts, but run their boat on
shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from
me, which was very happy for me; for otherwise
they would have landed just, as I may say, at my
door, and would have soon beaten me out of my
castle, and perhaps, have plundered me of all I
had.
When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one
or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so; there were in all eleven men, whereof three
of them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them
were jumped on shore, they took those three out
of the boat as prisoners. One of the three I could
perceive using the most passionate gestures of en-
treaty, affliction, and despair, even to a kind of
extravagance; the other two, I could perceive,
lifted up their hands sometimes, and appeared con-
cerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the
first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and
knew not what the meaning of it should be. Fri-
day called out to me in English, as well as he could,
O master! you see English mans eat prisoners as
well as savage mans. Why, said I, Friday, do you
think they are going to eat them then * Yes, says
Friday, they will eat them. No, no, said I, Fri-
day; I am afraid they will murder them indeed;
but you may be sure they will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the mat-
ter really was, but stood trembling with horror
of the sight, expecting every moment when the
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw
one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cut-
las (as the seamen call it) or sword, to strike one
of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall
every moment, at which all the blood in my body
seemed to run chill in my veins.
I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
savage that was gone with him; or that I had any
way to have come undiscovered within shot of
them, that I might have rescued the three men;
for I saw no fire-arms they had among them; but
it fell out to my mind another way.
After I had observed the outrageous usage of
the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed
the fellows ran scattering about the land, as if
they wanted to see the country. I observed also,
that the three other men had liberty to go where
they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the
ground very pensive, and looked like men in despair.
This put me in mind of the first time when I
came on shore, and began to look about me; how
I gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked
round me, what dreadful apprehensions I had, and
how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being
devoured by wild beasts.
As I knew nothing that night of the supply I
was to receive by the providential driving of
the ship nearer the land, by the storms and tides
by which I have since been so long nourished and
supported; so these three poor desolate men knew
nothing how certain of deliverance and supply
they were, how near it was to them, and how ef.
fectually and really they were in a condition of
safety, at the same time they thought themselves
lost, and their case desperate. -
So little do we see before us in the world, and
so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon
the great Maker of the world, that he does not
leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but that
in the worst circumstances they have always some-
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer
their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are
even brought to their deliverance by the means
by which they seem to be brought to their de-
struction.
. It was just at the top of high-water when these
people came on shore, and while partly they stood
parlying with the prisoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to see what kind
of place they were in, they had carelessly staid till
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed con-
siderably away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking
sooner than the other, and finding the boat too
fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the
rest who were straggling about, upon which they
all soon came to the boat; but it was past all their
strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy,
and the shore on that side being a soft oosy sand,
almost like a quicksand. . . .
. In this condition, like true seamen, who are,
perhaps, the least of all mankind given to fore-
thought, they gave it over, and away they strolled
about the country again; and I heard one of them
say aloud to another (calling them off from the
boat), Why let her alone, Jack, can’t ye 2 she'll
float next tide. By which I was fully confirmed in
the main inquiry, of what countrymen they were.
... All this while I kept myself close, not once dar-
ing to stir out of my castle, any further than to
my place of observation, near the top of the hill;
and very glad I was, to think how well it was for-
tified. I knew it was no less than ten hours be-
fore the boat could be on float again, and by that
VOL. I. A A
time it would be dark, and I might be more at li-
berty to see their motions, and to hear their dis-
course, if they had any.
In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle,
as before, though with more caution, knowing I
had to do with another kind of enemy than I had
at first. I ordered Friday also, whom I had made
an excellent marksman with his gun, to load him-
self with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces,
and I gave him three musquets: my figure, indeed,
was very fierce; I had my formidable goat-skin
coat on, with the great cap I mentioned, a naked
sword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon
each shoulder.
It was my design, as I said above, not to have
made any attempt till it was dark; but about two
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in
short they were all gone straggling into the woods,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep; the
three poor distressed men too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, were however set down
under the shelter of a great tree, at about a quar-
ter of a mile from me, and as I thought, out of
sight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immedi-
ately I marched in the figure above, my man Fri-
day at a good distance behind me, as formidable
for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring
a spectre-like figure as I did.
I came as near them undiscovered as I could,
and then, before any of them saw me, I called
aloud to them in Spanish, What are ye, Gentle-
men P
They started up at the noise; but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the un-
couth figure that I made: they made no answer
at all, but I thought I perceived them just going
to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English.
Gentlemen, said I, do not be surprised at me; per-
haps you may have a friend near you, when you
did not expect it. He must be sent directly from
Heaven then, said one of them very gravely to
me, pulling off his hat at the same time, for our
condition is past the help of man. All help is from
Heaven, Sir, said I: but can you put a stranger in
the way how to help you? for you seem to me
to be in some great distress. I saw you when you
landed; and when you seemed to make application
to the brutes that came with you—I saw one of
them lift up his sword to kill you.
The poor man with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one astonished, re-
turned, Am I talking to GoD or man? Is it a real-
man, or an angel? Be in no fear about that, Sir,
said I: if God had sent an angel to relieve you,
he would have come better clothed, and armed
after another manner than you see me in ; pray
lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Englishman,
and disposed to assist you; you see I have one ser-
vant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us
freely, Can we serve you? What is your case ?
A A 2
Our case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are so near; but in short, Sir,
I was commander of that ship; my men having
mutinied against me, they have been hardly pre-
vailed on not to murder me, and at last have set
me on shore in this desolate place, with these two,
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger;
where we expected to perish, believing the place
to be uninhabited, and know not what to think of it.
Where are those brutes, your enemies? said I:
Do you know where they are gone? There they
are, Sir, said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; my
heart trembles for fear they have seen us, and
heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly
murder us all, - -
Have they any fire arms 2 said I: he answered,
they had only two pieces, and one which they left
in the boat. Well then, said I, leave the rest to
me; I see they are all asleep; it is an easy thing
to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them
prisoners? He told me there were two desperate
villains among them, that it was scarce safe to
shew any mercy to ; but if they were secured, he
believed all the rest would return to their duty.
I asked him, Which they were 2 He told me, he
could not at that distance describe them; but he
would obey my orders in any thing I would
direct. Well, said I, let us retreat out of their
view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will
resolve farther; so they willingly went back with
me, till the woods covered us from them.
Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your
deliverance, are you willing to make two condi-
tions with me? He anticipated my proposals, by
telling me, that both he and the ship, if recovered,
should be wholly directed and commanded by me
in every thing; and if the ship was not recovered,
he would live and die with me in what part of the
world soever I would send him ; and the two other
men said the same. - -
Well, said I, my conditions are but two: 1.
That while you stay on this island with me, you
will not pretend to any authority here; and if I
put arms into your hands, you will upon all occa-
sions give them up to me, and do no prejudice to
me or mine, upon this island, and in the mean
time to be governed by my orders.
2. That if the ship is, or may be recovered, you
will carry me and my man to England, passage
free.
He gave me all the assurance that the invention
and faith of a man could devise, that he would
comply with these most reasonable demands; and
besides, would owe his life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all occasions as long as he lived. -
Well then, said I, here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you
think is proper to be done: he shewed all the tes-
timony of his gratitude that he was able; but of.
fered to be wholly guided by me: I told him, I
thought it was hard venturing anything; but the
best method I could think of, was to fire upon
A A 3
them at once, as they lay; and if any were not
killed at the first volley, and offered to submit,
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon
God’s providence to direct the shot.
He said, very modestly, that he was loth to kill
them, if he could help it; but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of
all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped,
we should be undone still: for they would go on
board, and bring the whole ship's company, and
destroy us all. Well then, said I, necessity legiti-
mates my advice; for it is the only way to save
our lives. However, seeing him still cautious of
shedding blood, I told him, they should go them-
selves, and manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some
of them awake, and soon after we saw two of them
on their feet. I asked him, If either of them were
the men who he had said were the heads of the
mutiny? He said No. Well then, said I, you may
let them escape, and Providence seems to have
wakened them on purpose to save themselves:
Now, said I, if the rest escape you, it is your
fault.
Animated with this, he took the musket I had
given him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece
in his hand : the two men, who were with him,
going first, made some noise, at which one of the
seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing
them coming, cried out to the rest; but it was too
late then; for the moment he cried out, they fired,
I mean the two men, the captain wisely reserving
his own piece: they had so well aimed their shot
at the men they knew, that one of them was killed
on the spot, and the other very much wounded;
but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and
called eagerly for help to the other; but the cap-
tain, stepping to him, told him it was too late to
cry for help ; he should call upon GoD to forgive
his villainy; and with that word knocked him
down with the stock of his musket, so that he
never spoke more : there were three more in the
company, and one of them was also slightly
wounded; by this time I was come; and when
they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to
resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told
them he would spare their lives, if they would
give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the
treachery they had been guilty of, and would swear
to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and
afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came. They gave him all the pro-
testations of their sincerity that could be desired;
and he was willing to believe them, and spare their
lives, which I was not against; only I obliged him
to keep them bound hand and foot while they were
upon the island,
While this was doing, I sent Friday with the
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to secure
her, and bring away the oars and sail, which they
did; and by and bye, three straggling men, that
A A 4
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came
back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their
captain, who before was their prisoner, now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also, and
so our victory was complete. -
. . It now remained, that the captain and I should
inquire into one another’s circumstances. I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of won-
ders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to
have been preserved there on purpose to save his
life, the tears ran down his face, and he could not
speak a word more. . . .
After this communication was at an end, I car-
ried him and his two men into my apartments,
leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the
top of the house; where I refreshed them with
‘such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the
contrivances I had made during my long, long in-
habiting that place. -
All I shewed them, all I said to them, was per-
fectly amazing; but above all, the captain admired
my fortification; and how perfectly I had con-
cealed my retreat with a grove of the trees, which,
having now been planted near twenty years, and
the trees growing much faster than in England, was
become a little wood, and so thick, that it was un-
passable in any part of it, but at that one side where
I had reserved my little winding passage into it:
this I told him was my castle, and my residence;
but that I had a seat in the country, as most princes
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I
would shew him that too another time; but at pre-
sent our business was to consider how to recover
the ship. He agreed with me as to that ; but told
me, he was perfectly at a loss what measure to take;
for that there were still six-and-twenty hands on
board, who having entered into a cursed conspi-
racy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to
the law, would be hardened in it now by despera-
tion; and would carry it on, knowing that if they
were reduced, they should be brought to the gal-
lows as soon as they came to England, or to any
of the English colonies; and that therefore there
would be no attacking them with so small a num-
ber as we were.
I mused for some time upon what he had said,
and found it was a very rational conclusion, and
that therefore something was to be resolved on
very speedily, as well to draw the men on board
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent
their landing upon us, and destroying us; upon
this it presently occurred to me, that in a little
while, the ship's crew, wondering what was be.
come of their comrades, and of the boat, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat to see
for them; and that then perhaps they might come
armed, and be too strong for us: this he allowed
was rational.
Upon this I told him, the first thing we were to
do, was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach,
so that they might not carry her off; and taking
every thing out of her, leave her so far useless as
not to be fit to swim; accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out
of her, and whatever else we found there, which
was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few
biscuit cakes, an horn of powder, and a great lump
of sugar in a piece of canvass; the sugar was five or
six pounds; all which was very welcome to me,
especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had
had none left for many years.
When we had carried all these things on shore
(the oars, mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were
carried before, as above), we knocked a great hole
in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough
to master us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry us
away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
friends the Spaniards in my way; for I had them
still in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up
upon the beach, so high that the tide would not
float her off at high-water mark; and, besides,
had broken an hole in her bottom, too big to be
quickly stopped, and were sat down musing what
we should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and
saw her make a waft with her ancient, as a signal
for the boat to come on board; but no boat stirred;
and they fired several times, making other signals
for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firings proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them (by the help of our glasses) hoist another
boat out, and row towards the shore; and we
found, as they approached, that there were no less
than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms
with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the
shore, we had a full view of them as they came,
and a plain sight of the men, even of their faces;
because the tide having set them a little to the east
of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to
come to the same place where the other had landed,
and where the boat lay.
By this means, Isay, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the persons and characters of
all the men in the boat; of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure,
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being
overpowered and frighted.
But that for the boatswain, who, it seems, was
the chief officer among them, and all the rest, they
were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew ; and
were, no doubt, made desperate in their new enter-
prize; and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our
circumstances were past the operations of fear:
that seeing almost every condition that could be
was better than that we were supposed to be in, we
ought to expect that the consequence, whether
death or life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I
asked him, what he thought of the circumstances of
my life, and whether a deliverance was not worth
venturing for 2 And where, Sir, said I, is your be-
lief of my being preserved here on purpose to save
your life, which elevated you a little while ago?
For my part, said I, there seems to be but one thing
amiss in all the prospect of it. What is that? says
he. Why, said I, it is that, as you say, there are
three or four honest fellows among them, which
should be spared; had they been all of the wicked
part of the crew, I should have thought GoD's pro-
vidence had singled them out to deliver them into
your hands; for, depend upon it, every man of
them that comes ashore are our own, and shall die
or live, as they behave to us.
As I spoke this with a raised voice, and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him;
so we set vigorously to our business: we had, upon
the first appearance of the boat’s coming from the
ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and
had indeed secured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was less as-
sured than ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one
of the three (delivered men) to my cave, where
they were remote enough, and out of danger of
being heard or discovered, or of finding their way
out of the woods, if they could have delivered them-
selves: here they left them bound, but gave them
provisions, and promised them, if they continued
there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or
two; but that if they attempted their escape, they
should be put to death without mercy. . They pro-
mised faithfully to bear their confinement with pa-
tience, and were very thankful that they had such
good usage as to have provisions, and a light left
them ; for Friday gave them candles (such as we
made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did
not know but that he stood centinel over them at
the entrance. - -
The other prisoners had better usage; two of
them were kept pinioned indeed, because the cap-
tain was not free to trust them ; but the other two
were taken into my service upon their captain's
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging
to live and die with us; so, with them and the
three honest men, we were seven men well armed;
and I made no doubt we should be able to deal
well enough with the ten that were coming, con-
sidering that the captain had said, there were three
or four honest men among them also. *
As soon as they got to the place where their
other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach,
and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the boat at an anchor,
some distance from the shore, with some hands in
her to guard her; and so we should not be able to
seize the boat.
Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; and it was easy to see they
were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as
above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
her bottom. -
After they had mused a while upon this, they
set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all
their might, to try if they could make their compa-
nions hear; but all was to no purpose; then they
came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their
small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring; but it was all one; those in
the cave, we were sure, could not hear; and those
in our keeping, though they heard it well enough,
yet durst give no answer to them.
They were so astonished at the surprise of this,
that, as they told us afterwards, they resolved to
go all on board again to their ship, and let them
know there, that the men were all murdered, and
the long-boat staved; accordingly, they immedi-
ately launched the boat again, and got all of them
on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again, and set sail, giving their comrades
up for lost, and so he should still lose the ship,
which he was in hopes we should have recovered;
but he was quickly as much frighted the other
way.
They had not been long put off with the boat,
but we perceived them all coming on shore again;
but with this new measure in their conduct,
which, it seems, they consulted together upon, viz.
to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go
on shore, and go up into the country to look for
their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us; for now
we were at a loss what to do ; for our seizing those
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if
we let the boat escape, because they would then
row away to the ship; and then the rest of them
would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our
recovering the ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present: the seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained
in the boat put her off to a good distance from the
shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them ; so
that it was impossible for us to come at them in
the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could see them
plainly, though they could not perceive us: we
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them;
or that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the
hill, where they could see a great way in the
valley and woods, which lay towards the north-
east part, and where the island lay lowest, they
shouted and hallooed till they were weary; and
not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore,
nor far from one another, they sat down together
under a tree, to consider of it: had they thought
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of
them had done, they had done the job for us; but
they were too full of apprehensions of danger to
venture to go to sleep, though they could not tell
what the danger was they had to fear neither. .
The captain made a very just proposal to me
upon this consultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps
they would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to
make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally
upon them, just at the juncture when their pieces
were all discharged, and they would certainly yield,
and we should have them without bloodshed. I
liked the proposal, provided it was done while we
were near enough to come up to them, before they
could load their pieces again. - -
But this event did not happen, and we lay still
a long time, very irresolute what course to take; at
length I told them, there would be nothing to be
done in my opinion till night; and then, if they
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so
might use some stratagem with them in the boat, to
get them on shore.
: We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneasy: when,
after long consultations, we saw them start all up,
and march down toward the sea: it seems, they
had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on
board the ship again, give their companions over for
lost, and so go on with their intended voyage with
the ship. - - -
As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore,
I imagined it to be as it really was ; that they had
given over their search, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions
of it; but I presently thought of a stratagem to
fetch them back again, and which answered my end
to a tittle. , • * : . . .”
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where the savages came on shore when Friday was
rescued; and as soon as they came to a little rising
ground, at about half a mile's distance, Ibade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever
they heard the seamen answer them, they should
return it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take
a round, always answering when the others hal-
looed, to draw them as far into the island, and
among the woods, as possible, and then wheel about
again to me, by such ways as I directed. . . *
They were just going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them, and answering ran along the shore westward
VOL. I. B B
towards the voice they heard, when they were
presently stopped by the creek, where, the water
being up, they could not get over, and called for
the boat to come up, and set them over, as indeed
I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that the boat being gone up a good way into the
creek, and as it were in an harbour within the
land, they took one of the three men out of her to
go along with them, and left only two in the boat,
having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on
the shore.
This was what I wished for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain’s mate to their bu-
siness, I took the rest with me, and, crossing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men
before they were aware, one of them lying on
shore, and the other being in the boat; the fellow
on shore was between sleeping and waking, and
going to start up, the captain, who was foremost,
ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and then
called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a
dead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon
him, and his comrade knocked down; besides, this
was, it seems, one of the three that were not so
hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield,
but afterwards to join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one hill to another, and from one wood to another,
till they not only heartily tired them, but left them
where they were very sure they could not reach
back to the boat before it was dark; and indeed
they were heartily tired themselves also by the time
they came back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make
sure work with them.
It was several hours after Friday came back to
me before they came back to their boat; and we
could hear the foremost of them, long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along ; and could also hear them answer, and com-
plain how lame and tired they were, and not being
able to come any faster, which was very welcome
neVS to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion, when they
found the boat fast a-ground in the creek. The
tide ebbed out, and their two men gone; we could
hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into
an enchanted island; that either there were inha-
bitants in it, and they should all be murdered; or
else there were devils or spirits in it, and they should
be all carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two com-
rades by their names a great many times, but no
B B 2
answer: after some time, we could see them, by
the little light there was, run about wringing their
hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest
themselves, then come ashore, and walk about
again, and so the same thing over again.
My men would fain have had me give them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was
willing to take them at some advantage, so to spare
them, and kill as few of them as I could ; and es-
pecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any
of our men, knowing the other men were very well
armed : I resolved to wait to see if they did not
separate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I
drew my ambuscade nearer; and ordered Friday
and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet
as close to the ground as they could, that they
might not be discovered, and get as near them as
they could possibly, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, till the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader of the
mutiny, and had now shewn himself the most de-
jected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking
towards them with two more of the crew; the cap-
tain was so eager, at having the principal rogue so
much in his power, that he could hardly have pa-
tience to let him come so near as to be sure of him;
for they only heard his tongue before : but when
they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting
up on their feet, let fly at them. -
. The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him,
though he did not die till an hour or two after; and
the third ran for it. -
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men;
viz. myself, generalissimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-
general; the captain and his two men, and the
three prisoners of war, whom he had trusted with
armS. -
We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that
they could not see our number; and I made the
man they had left in the boat, who was now one
of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring
them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce
them to terms; which fell out just as we desired;
for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition
then was, they would be very willing to capitulate;
so he calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them,
Tom Smith, Tom Smith. Tom Smith answered
immediately, Who's that! Robinson | For it seems
he knew his voice. The other answered, Ay, ay;
for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms,
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment.
Who must we yield to 2 Where are they 2 says
Smith again. Here they are, says he here is our
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting
you this two hours; the boatswain is killed; Will
Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you
do not yield, you are all lost. - -- .
Will they give us quarter then? says Tom Smith,
and we will yield. I’ll go and ask, if you promise
B B 3
to yield, says Robinson. So he asked the captain,
and the captain himself then calls out; You, Smith,
you know my voice, if you lay down your arms im-
mediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all
but Will Atkins.
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For God’s sake,
captain, give me quarter: what have I done? they
have been all as bad as I: (which by the way was
not true, either; for it seems this Will Atkins was
the first man that laid hold of the captain when
they first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injurious language:)
however, the captain told him he must lay down
his arms at discretion, and trust to the governor's
mercy, by which he meant me; for they all called
me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parlied with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,
particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myself and one more out of
sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of seizing the ship; and as for the captain, now he
had leisure to parley with them, he expostulated
with them upon the villainy of their practices with
him, and at length, upon the further wickedness of
their design; and how certainly it must bring them
to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the
gallows. - -
They all appeared very penitent, and begged
hard for their lives. As for that, he told them they
were none of his prisoners, but the commander's
of the island; that they thought they had set him
on shore in a barren uninhabited island; but it
had pleased GoD so to direct them, that the island
was inhabited, and that the governor was an En-
glishman; that he might hang them all there, if
he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter,
he supposed he would send them to England, to
be dealt with there as justice required, except At-
kins, whom he was commanded by the governor to
advise to prepare for death; for that he would be
hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it
had its desired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees
to beg the captain to intercede with the governor
for his life; and all the rest begged of him for
GoD's sake, that they might not be sent to
England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our de-
liverance was come, and that it would be a most
easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in
getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the
dark from them, that they might not see what kind
of a governor they had, and called the captain to
me; when I called, as at a good distance, one of
the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the
captain, Captain, the commander calls for you;
and presently the captain replied, Tell his excel-
lency I am just a coming. This more perfectly
*
B B 4
amused them; and they all believed, that the com-
mander was just by with his fifty men. ". . . . ;
. Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonder-
fully well, and resolved to put it in execution the
next morning. - . . . .
But, in order to execute it with more art, and to
be secure of success, I told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins,
and two more of the worst of them, and send them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was
committed to Friday, and the two men who came
on shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison;
and it was indeed a dismal place, especially to men
in their condition. - - -
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called
it, of which I have given a full description; and
as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place
was secure enough, considering they were upon
their behaviour. ~ --
To these in the morning I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word,
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might be trusted or no, to go on board, and sur-
prise the ship : he talked to them of the injury
done him, of the condition they were brought to:
and that though the governor had given them
quarter for their lives as to the present action, yet
that if they were sent to England, they would all
be hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they
would join in such an attempt, as to recover the
ship, he would have the governor’s engagement for
their pardon. -
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised with the deepest imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the last drop of blood,
and that they should owe their lives to him, and
would go with him all over the world; that they
would own him for a father to them as long as they
lived.
Well, says the captain, I must go and tell the
governor what you say, and see what I can do to
bring him to consent to it: so he brought me an
account of the temper he found them in, and that
he verily believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very secure, I told
him he should go back again, and choose out five
of them, and tell them, that they should see that
they did not want men; but he would take out
those five to be his assistants, and that the governor
would keep the other two, and the three that were
sent prisoners to the castle, (my cave) as hostages,
for the fidelity of those five; and that if they
proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hos-
tages should be hanged in chains alive upon the
shore. -
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest; however, they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now the
business of the prisoners, as much as of the captain,
to persuade the other five to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expe-
dition. 1. The captain, his mate, and passenger.
2. Then the two prisoners of the first gang, to
whom, having their characters from the captain, I
had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms.
8. The other two whom I kept till now in my bower
pinioned; but, upon the captain’s motion, had now
released. 4. These five released at last ; so that
they were twelve in all, besides five we kept pri-
soners in the cave for hostages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with these hands on board the ship : for, as for me
and my man Friday, I did not think it was proper
for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and
it was employment enough for us to keep them
asunder, and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep
them fast; but Friday went twice a day to them,
to supply them with necessaries; and I made the
other two carry provisions to a certain distance,
where Friday was to take it.
When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it
was with the captain, who told them, I was the
person the governor had ordered to look after
them, and that it was the governor’s pleasure that
they should not stir any where but by my direc-
tion; that if they did, they should be fetched into
the castle, and be laid in irons; so that as we never
suffered them to see me as governor, so I now
appeared as another person, and spoke of the go-
vernor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon
all occasions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him,
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach of
one, and man them : he made his passenger cap-
tain of one, with four other men; and himself, and
his mate, and five more, went in the other; and
they contrived their business very well; for they
came up to the ship about midnight. As soon as
they came within call of the ship, he made Robin-
son hail them, and tell them he had brought off
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time
before they had found them, and the like ; holding
them in a chat, till they came to the ship's side;
when the captain and the mate, entering first with
their arms, immediately knocked down the second
mate and carpenter with the butt end of their mus-
quets, being very faithfully seconded by their men;
they secured all the rest that were upon the main
and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the hatches
to keep them down who were below, when the
other boat, and their men, entering at the fore-
chains, secured the forecastle of the ship, and the
skuttle which went down into the cook-room,
making three men they found there prisoners.
When this was done, and all safe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate with three men to
break into the round house, where the new rebel
captain lay, and, having taken the alarm, was got-
ten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten
fire-arms in their hands; and when the mate with
a crow split open the door, the new captain and
his men fired boldly among them, and wounded
the mate with a musquet ball, which broke his
arm, and wounded two more of the men, but
killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however,
into the round-house, wounded as he was, and
with his pistol shot the new captain through the
head, the bullets entering at his mouth, and came
out again behind one of his ears; so that he never
spoke a word; upon which the rest yielded, and
the ship was taken effectually, without any more
lives being lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the sig-
nal agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his
success; which you may be sure I was very glad
to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it
till near two of the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue
to me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur-
prised with the noise of a gun; and presently
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name
of Governor, governor; and presently I knew
the captain's voice, when climbing up to the top
of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship
he embraced me in his arms. My dear friend
and deliverer, says he, there is your ship, for she
is all your's, and so are we, and all that belong to
her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode within a little more than half a mile of the
shore; for they had weighed her anchor as soon
as they were masters of her; and the weather be-
ing fair, had brought her to an anchor just against
the mouth of a little creek; and the tide being up,
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the
place where I first landed my rafts, and so landed
just at my door. -
I was, at first, ready to sink down with the sur-
prise: for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship
just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to
go. At first, for some time, I was not able to an-
swer one word; but as he had taken me in his
arms, I held fast by him, or I should have fallen
to the ground. - 2
He perceived the surprise, and immediately
pulled a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a
dram of cordial, which he had brought on purpose
for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the
ground, and though it brought me to myself, yet
it was a good while before I could speak a word to
him. - - -
All this while the poor man was in as great an
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise, as I
was ; and he said a thousand kind tender things
to me, to compose and bring me to myself; but
such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put
all my spirits into confusion; at last it broke into
tears, and in a little while after I recovered my
speech.
Then I took my turn and embraced him as my
deliverer, and we rejoiced together. I told him,
I looked upon him as a man sent from Heaven to
deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as
these were the testimonies we had of a secret hand
of Providence governing the world, and an evi-
dence, that the eyes of an infinite power could
search into the remotest corner of the world, and
send help to the miserable whenever he pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness
to Heaven; and what heart could forbear to bless
Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner
provided for one in such a wilderness, and in such
a desolate condition, but from whom every deli-
verance must always be acknowledged to pro-
ceed
When we had talked awhile, the captain told
me, he had brought me some little refreshments,
such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches,
who had been so long his masters, had not plun-
dered him of: upon this he called aloud to the boat,
and bids his men bring the things ashore that were
for the governor; and indeed it was a present as
if I had been one, not that I was to be carried
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the island still, and they were to go without
IIle.
First, he had brought me a case of bottles full
of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of
Madeira wine; the bottles held two quarts a piece;
two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of
pork, with a bag of peas, and about an hundred
weight of biscuit.
He brought me also a box of sugar, a box of
flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of
lime-juice, and abundance of other things: but be-
sides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts,
six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one
pair of shoes, an hat, and one pair of stockings,
and a very good suit of clothes of his own, which
had been worn but very little : in a word, he
clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any
one may imagine to one in my circumstances;
but never was any thing in the world of that kind
so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it was to
me to wear such clothes at their first putting on.
After these ceremonies passed, and after all his
good things were brought into my little apart-
ment, we began to consult what was to be done
with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con-
sidering whether we might venture to take them
away with us or no, especially two of them, whom
we knew to be incorrigible and refractory to the
last degree; and the captain said, he knew they
were such rogues, that there was no obliging
them; and if he did carry them away it must be
in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to
justice at the first English colony he could come
at; and I found that the captain himself was very
anxious about it. -
Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I
durst undertake to bring the two men he spoke of,
to make it their own request that he should leave
them upon the island. I should be very glad of
that, says the captain, with all my heart. - -
Well, said I, I will send for them, and talk with
them for you : so I caused Friday and the two
hostages, for they were now discharged, their
comrades having performed their promise; I say,
I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the
five men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and
keep them there till I came. - -
After some time, I came thither dressed in my
new habit, and now I was called governor again.
Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused
the men to be brought before me, and I told them,
I had had a full account of their villainous beha-
viour to the captain, and how they had run away
with the ship, and were preparing to commit fur-
ther robberies; but that Providence had ensnared
them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had digged for others.
I let them know, that by my direction the ship
had been seized, that she lay now in the road,
and they might see by and by, that their new
captain had received the reward of his villainy;
*
for that they might see him hanging at the
yard arm. .
That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to say, why I should not execute them as pi-
rates taken in the fact, as by my commission they
could not doubt I had authority to do.
One of them answered in the name of the rest,
that they had nothing to say but this, That when
they were taken, the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy: but I
told them I knew not what mercy to shew them;
for, as for myself, I had resolved to quit the island
with all my men, and had taken passage with the
captain to go for England: and as for the captain,
he could not carry them to England, other than
as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and
running away with the ship; the consequence of
which, they must needs know, would be the gal-
lows: so that I could not tell which was best for
them, unless they had a mind to take their fate in
the island: if they desired that, I did not care, as
I had liberty to leave it; I had some inclination
to give them their lives, if they thought they
could shift on shore. They seemed very thank-
ful for it; said they would much rather venture to
stay there, than to be carried to England to be
hanged: so I left it on that issue.
However, the captain seemed to make some
difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them there:
upon this I seemed to be a little angry with the
captain, and told him, that they were my prisoners,
VOL. I. C C - -
not his ; and that seeing I had offered them so
much favour, I would be as good as my word;
and that if he did not think fit to consent to it, I
would set them at liberty as I found them; and if
he did not like that, he might take them again, if
he could catch them.
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them
retire into the woods, to the place whence they
came, and I would leave them some fire-arms,
some ammunition, and some directions how they
should live very well, if they thought fit.
Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship;
but told the captain, that I would stay that night
to prepare my things; and desired him to go on
board in the meantime, and keep all right in the
ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for
me; ordering him, in the meantime, to cause the
new captain who was killed, to be hanged at the
yard-arm, that these men might see him.
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men
up to me to my apartment, and entered seriously
into discourse with them of their circumstances.
I told them, I thought they had made a right
choice; that if the captain carried them away,
they would certainly be hanged. I shewed them
their captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship,
and told them they had nothing less to expect.
When they had all declared their willingness to
stay, I then told them, I would let them into the
story of my living there, and put them into the
way of making it easy to them: accordingly I gave
them the whole history of the place, and of my
coming to it; shewed them my fortifications, the
way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my
grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to
make them easy. I told them the story of the
sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected; for
whom I left a letter, and made them promise to
treat them in common with themselves.
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five musquets,
three fowling-pieces, and three swords. I had
about a barrel of powder left; for after the first
year or two I used but little, and wasted none. I
gave them a description of the way I managed the
goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to
make both butter and cheese.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own
story; and I told them, I would prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder
more, and some garden-seed, which I told them I
would have been very glad of; also I gave them
the bag of peas which the captain had brought me
to eat, and bade them be sure to sow and increase
them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day,
and went on board the ship; we prepared imme-
diately to sail, but did not weigh that night. The
next morning early, two of the five men came
swimming to the ship's side, and making a most
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged
to be taken into the ship, for God's sake, for they
C C 2
should be murdered; and begged the captain to
take them on board, though he hanged them im-
mediately. *
Upon this the captain pretended to have no
power without me; but after some difficulty, and
after their solemn promises of amendment, they
were taken on board, and were some time after
soundly whipped and pickled; after which they
proved very honest and quiet fellows. .
Some time after this, I went with the boat on
shore, the tide being up, with the things promised
to the men, to which the captain, at my interces-
sion, caused their chests and clothes to be added,
which they took, and were very thankful for... I
also encouraged them, by telling them, that if it
lay in my way to send a vessel to take them h, I
would not forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on
board for reliques the great goat's-skin cap I had
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned,
which had lain by me so long useless that it was
grown rusty, or tarnished, and could hardly pass
for silver, till it had been a little rubbed and
handled; and also the money I found in the
wreck of the Spanish ship.
And thus I left the island the nineteenth of De-
cember, as I found by the ship's account, in the
year 1686, after I had been upon it eight and
twenty years, two months, and nineteen days;
being delivered from the second captivity the same
day of the month that I first made my escape in
the Barco-longo, from among the Moors of Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687,
having been thirty and five years absent.
When I came to England, I was a perfect
stranger to all the world, as if I had never been
known there: my benefactor, and faithful steward,
whom I had left in trust with my money, was
alive but had had great misfortunes in the world,
was become a widow the second time, and very low
in the world. I made her easy as to what she
owed me, assuring her, I would give her no trouble;
but on the contrary, in gratitude to her former
care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my
little stock would afford, which at that time would
indeed allow me to do but little for her: but I
assured her, I would never forget her former
kindness to me; nor did I forget her, when I
had sufficient to help her; as shall be observed in
its place.
: I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the fa-
mily extinct; except that I found two sisters, and
two of the children of one of my brothers: and as
I had been long ago given over for dead, there
had been no provision made for me, so that, in a
word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me; and
that little money I had, would not do so much for
me as to settling in the world. * .
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which
C C 3
I did not expect; and this was, that the master of
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, and by
the same means saved the ship and cargo, having
given a very handsome account to the owners of
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men,
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and
some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a very handsome compliment upon that
subject, and a present of almost two hundred
pounds sterling. -
But after making several reflections upon the
circumstances of my life, and how little way this
would go towards settling me in the world, I re-
solved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not
come by some information of the state of my plan-
tation in the Brasils, and what was become of my
partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some
years now given me over for dead.
With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following; my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all these ram-
blings, and proving a most faithful servant upon
all occasions.
When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by in-
quiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old
friend, the captain of the ship, who first took me
up at sea, off the shore of Africa: he was now
grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his.
son, who was far from a young man, into his ship;
and who still used the Brasil trade. The old man
did not know me, and indeed, I hardly knew him;
but I soon brought myself to his remembrance,
when I told him who I was. -
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you may be sure, after my
plantation, and my partner. The old man told me,
he had not been in the Brasils for about nine
years; but that he could assure me, that when he
came away my partner was living; but the trus-
tees, whom I had joined with him, to take cogni-
zance of my part, were both dead; that, however,
he believed that I would have a very good account
of the improvement of the plantation; for that,
upon the general belief of my being cast away and
drowned, my trustees had given in the account of
the produce of my part of the plantation to the
procurator fiscal; who had appropriated it, in case
I never came to claim it, one third to the King,
and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine,
to be expended for the benefit of the poor, and for
the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith;
but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim
the inheritance, it would be restored; only that
the improvement, or annual production, being dis-
tributed to charitable uses, could not be restored ;
but he assured me, that the steward of the king's
revenue (from lands) and the provedore, or steward
of the monastery, had taken great care all along,
that the incumbent, that is to say, my partner,
gave every year a faithful account of the produce,
of which they received duly my moiety.
I asked him, if he knew to what height of im-
C C 4
provement he had brought the plantation: and
whether he thought it might be worth looking
after; or whether, on my going thither, I should
meet yith no obstruction to my possessing my just
right in the moiety.
He told me, he could not tell exactly to what
degree the plantation was improved; but this he
knew, that my partner was growing exceeding
rich upon the enjoying but one half of it! and
that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard
that the king's third of my part, which was, it
seems, granted away to some other monastery, or
religious house, amounted to above two hundred
moidores a year; that, as to my being restored to
a quiet possession of it, there was no question to
be made of that, my partner being alive to witness
my title, and my name being also inrolled in the
register of the country. Also he told me, that
the survivors of my two trustees were very fair,
honest people, and very wealthy, and he believed
I would not only have their assistance for putting
me in possession, but would find a very consider-
able sum of money in their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm, while their fathers
held the trust, and before it was given up as
above, which, as he remembered, was about twelve
years.
I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy
at this account, and inquired of the old captain,
how it came to pass, that the trustees should thus
dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had
made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese
captain, my universal heir, &c. -
He told me, that was true; but that, as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exe-
cutor, until some certain account should come of
my death; and that, besides, he was not willing to
intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was
true, he had registered my will, and put in his
claim ; and could he have given any account of
my being dead or alive, he would have acted by
procuration, and taken possession of the Ingenio
(so they called the sugar-house) and had given his
son, who was now at the Brasils, order to do it. .
But, (says the old man) I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so
acceptable to you as the rest; and that is, that
believing you were lost, and all the world believ
ing so also, your partner and trustees did offer to
account to me in your name, for six or eight of
the first years of profit, which I received; but
there being at that time, says he, great disburse-
ments for increasing the works, building an inge-
nio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near
so much as afterwards it produced: however, says
the old man, I shall give you a true account of
what I have received in all, and how I have dis-
posed of it.
After a few days further conference with this
ancient friend, he brought me an account of the
six first years income of my plantation, signed by
my partner, and the merchant's trustees, being
always delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll,
and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c.
which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I
found by this account, that every year the income
considerably increased: but, as above, the disburse-
ment being large, the sum at first was small: how-
ever, the old man let me see, that he was debtor
to me 470 moidores of gold, besides 60 chests of
sugar, and 15 double rolls of tobacco, which were
lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming
home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leav-
ing the place.
The good man then began to complain of his
misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make
use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him
a sharein a new ship; — However, my old friend,
says he, you shall not want a supply in your ne-
cessity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall
be fully satisfied.
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives
me two hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and
giving me the writings of his title to the ship
which his son was gone to the Brasils in, of which
he was a quarter part owner, and his son another,
he put them both in my hands for security of the
rest.
I was too much moved with the honesty and
kindness of the poor man to be able to bear this;
and remembering what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at sea, and how generously
he had used me on all occasions, and particularly
how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he said to me.
Therefore, first I asked him if his circumstances
admitted him to spare so much money at that time,
and if it would not straiten him P. He told me he
could not say but it might straiten him a little;
but, however, it was my money, and I might want
it more than he.
Every thing the good man said was full of affec-
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while
he spoke. In short, I took one hundred of the
moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him
a receipt for them; then I returned him the rest,
and told him, if ever I had possession of the plan-
tation, I would return the other to him also, as
indeed I afterwards did : and that, as to the bill
of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not
take it by any means; but that if I wanted the
money, I found he was honest enough to pay me;
and if I did not, but came to receive what he gave
me reason to expect, I would never have a penny
more from him.
When this was passed, the old man began to ask
me if he should put me in a method to make my
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself. He said, I might do so if I
pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to secure my right, and immediately to
appropriate the profits to my use; and as there
were ships in the river of Lisbon, just ready to go
away to Brasil, he made me enter my name in a
public register, with his affidavit, affirming upon
oath that I was alive, and that I was the same per-
son who took up the land for the planting the said
plantation at first.
This being regularly attested by a notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to send it with
a letter of his writing, to a merchant of his ac-
quaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the
return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants on whose
account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
First, There was the account current of the pro-
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal
captain, being for six years; the balance appeared
to be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years
more while they kept the effects in their hands, be-
fore the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found,
which they call Civil Death; and the balance of
this, the value of the plantation increasing, amount-
ed to — cruisadoes, which made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Augustines
account, who had received the profits for above
fourteen years; but not being able to account for
what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly de.
clared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which
he acknowledged to my account. As to the king's
part, that refunded nothing. -
There was also a letter of my partner's, congra-
tulating me very affectionately upon my being
alive; giving me an account how the estate was
improved, and what it produced a year, with a par-
ticular of the number of squares, or acres, that it
contained; how planted, how many slaves there
were upon it; and, making two and twenty crosses
for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave
Marias to thank the blessed Virgin that I was alive,
inviting me very passionately to come over and
take possession of my own, and in the meantime
to give him orders to whom he should deliver my
effects, if I did not come myself; concluding with
an hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his
family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine leo
pards skins, which he had, it seems, received from
Africa by some other ship which he had sent thi.
ther, and who, it seems, had 'made a better voyage
than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent
sweetmeats, and an hundred pieces of gold un-
coined, not quite so large as moidores.
By the same fleet my merchant-trustees shipped
me 1200 chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold. -
I might well say now, indeed, that the latter
end of Job was better than the beginning. It is
impossible to express the flutterings of my very
heart, when I looked over these letters, and espe-
cially when I found all my wealth about me; for
as the Brasil ships came all in fleets, the same ships
which brought my letters brought my goods; and
the effects were safe in the Tagus before the letter
came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale, and
grew sick; and had not the old man run and
fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise
of joy had overset nature, and I had died upon the
spot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was
so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being
known, he ordered me to be let blood, after which
I had relief, and grew well; but I verily believe,
if it had not been eased by the vent given in that
manner to the spirits, I should have died.
I was now master, all on a sudden, of above
£50,000 sterling in money, and had an estate, as I
might well call it, in the Brasils, of above a thou-
sand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in
England; and in a word, I was in a condition which
I scarce knew how to understand, or how to com-
pose myself for the enjoyment of
The first thing I did was to recompense my ori-
ginal benefactor, my good old captain, who had
been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to
me in the beginning, and honest to me at the end.
I shewed him all that was sent me; I told him that,
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposes
all things, it was owing to him ; and that it now
lay on me to reward him, which I would do an
hundred fold. So I first returned to him the hun-
dred moidores I had received of him; then I sent
for a notary, and caused him to draw up a general
release or discharge for the 470 moidores which he
had acknowledged he owed me, in the fullest and
firmest manner possible; after which I caused a
procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be
my receiver of the annual profits of my plantation,
and appointing my partner to account to him, and
make the returns by the usual fleets to him in my
name; and a clause in the end, being a grant of
100 moidores a year to him during his life, out of
the effects; and fifty moidores a year to his son
after him, for his life. And thus I requited my
old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer my
course next, and what to do with the estate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in-
deed, I had more care upon my head now than I
had in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great
charge upon me, and my business was how to se-
cure it. I had never a cave to hide my money in,
or a place where it might lie without lock or key,
till it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body
would meddle with it. On the contrary, I knew
not where to put it, or to whom to trust with it;
my old patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and
that was the only refuge I had. . . .*
In the next place, my interest in the Brasils
seemed to summon methither; but now I could not
tell how to think of going thither till I had settled
my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands
behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who, I knew, was honest, and would be
just to me; but then she was in years, and but
poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in debt; so
that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to
England myself, and take my effects with me.
I was some months, however, before I resolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain fully, and to satisfaction, who had been
my former benefactor, so I began to think of my
poor widow, whose husband had been my first be-
nefactor, and she, while it was in her power, my
faithful steward and instructor. So the first thing
I did, I got a merchant in Lisbon to write to his
correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill,
but to go find her out, and carry her in money an
hundred pounds from me, and to talk with her,
and comfort her in her poverty, by telling her she
should, if I lived, have a further supply. At the
same time I sent my two sisters in the country,
each of them an hundred pounds, they being,
though not in want, yet not in very good circum-
stances; one having been married, and left a wi-
dow; and the other having an husband not so kind
to her as he should be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances, I
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst com-
mit the gross of my stock, that I might go away to
the Brasils, and leave things safe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me.
. I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasils,
and have settled myself there, for I was, as it were,
naturalized to the place; but I had some little
scruple in my mind about religion, which insensi-
bly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre-
sently. However, it was not religion that kept
me from going thither for the present; and as I
had made no scruple of being openly of the religion
of the country, all the while I was among them,
so neither did Iyet; only that now and then, having
of late thought more of it than formerly, when I
began to think of living and dying among them, I
began to regret my having professed myself a Papist,
and thought it might not be the best religion to
die in. - - -
But, as I have said, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brasils, but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my ef.
fects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to Eng-
land with them, where, if I arrived, I concluded
I should make some acquaintance, or find some
relations, that would be faithful to me; and accord-
ingly I prepared to go for England with all my
wealth. * , , , -
In order to prepare things for my going home,
I first (the Brasil fleet being just going away) re-
solved to give answers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I had from thence; and
VOL. I. D D
*
first to the prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a letter
full of thanks for his just dealings, and the offer
of the 872 moidores, which was undisposed of;
which I desired might be given, 500 to the mo-
nastery, and 872 to the poor, as the prior should
direct, desiring the good Padre's prayers for me,
and the like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trus-
tees, with all the acknowledgment that so much
justice and honesty called for; as for sending them
any present, they were far above having any occa-
sion for it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging
his industry in the improving the plantation, and
his integrity in increasing the stock of the works,
giving him instructions for his future government
of my part, according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send
whatever became due to me, till he should hear
from me more particularly : assuring him that it
was my intention, not only to come to him, but to
settle myself there for the remainder of my life.
To this I added a very handsome present of some
Italian silks for his wife and two daughters, for
such the captain's son informed me he had ; with
two pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I
could get in Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and
some Flanders lace of a good value.
Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo,
and turned all my effects into good bills of ex-
change, my next difficulty was, which way to go
to England. I had been accustomed enough to
the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go
to England by sea at that time; and though I
could give no reason for it, yet the difficulty in-
creased upon me so much, that though I had once
shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered
my mind, and that not once, but two or three
times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea,
and this might be one of the reasons. But let no
man slight the strong impulses of his own thoughts
in cases of such moment. Two of the ships which
I had singled out to go in, I mean more particu-
larly singled out than any other, that is to say, so
as in one of them to put my things on board, and
in the other to have agreed with the captain; I say,
two of these ships miscarried, viz. one was taken by
the Algerines, and the other was cast away on the
Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned, ex-
cept three; so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable, and in which most, it was
hard to say.
Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my
old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
pressed me earnestly not to go to sea; but either
to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the
Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but
an easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to
Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so
all the way by land through France.
In a word, I was so prepossessed against my go-
D D 2
ing by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that:
I resolved to travel all the way by land; which, as
I was not in haste, and did not value the charge,
was by much the pleasanter way; and to make it
more so, my old captain brought an English gen-
tleman, the son of a merchant in Lisbon, who was
willing to travel with me; after which, we picked
up two who were English, and merchants also,
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last go-
ing to Paris only; so that we were in all six of us,
and five servants, the two merchants, and the two
Portuguese, contenting themselves with one ser-
vant between two, to save the charge; and as for
me, I got an English sailor to travel with me as a
servant, besides my man Friday, who was too much
a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of
a servant upon the road.
In this manner I set out for Lisbon: and our
company being all very well mounted and armed,
we made a little troop, whereof they did me the
honour to call me captain, as well because I
was the oldest man, as because I had two ser-
vants, and indeed was the original of the whole
journey. -
As I have troubled you with none of my sea
journals, so shall I trouble you with none of my
land journals. But some adventures that happened
to us in this tedious and difficult journey, I must
not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
strangers to Spain, were willing to stay some
time to see the court of Spain, and to see what
was worth observing; but it being the latter part
of the summer, we hastened away, and set out
from Madrid about the middle of October. But
when we came to the edge of Navarre, we were
alarmed at several towns on the way, with an
account that so much snow was fallen on the
French side of the mountains, that several tra-
vellers were obliged to come back to Pampeluna,
after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to
pass on.
When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found
it so indeed; and to me that had been always used
to an hot climate, and indeed to countries where
we could scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was
insufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than
it was surprising, to come but ten days before out
of the Old Castile, where the weather was not only
warm, but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind
from the Pyrenean mountains, so very keen, so
severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes,
was very strange. -
Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw
the mountains all covered with snow, and felt cold
weather, which he had never seen or felt before in
his life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampe-
luna, it continued snowing with so much violence,
and so long, that the people said, winter was come
before its time; and the roads, which were difficult
D D 3
before, were now quite impassable : in a word, the
snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in north-
ern countries, there was no going without being
in danger of being buried alive every step. We
staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna;
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no like-
lihood of its being better, for it was the severest
winter all over Europe that had been known in
many years) I proposed that we should all go away
to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bour-
deaux, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were considering this, there came
in four French gentlemen, who, having been stop-
ped on the French side of the passes, as we were
on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who tra-
versing the country near the head of Languedoc,
had brought them over the mountains by such
ways, that they were not much incommoded with
the snow; and where they met with snow in any
quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to
bear them and their horses.
We sent for this guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the same way, with no
hazard from the snow, provided we were armed
sufficiently to protect us from wild beasts; for he
said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for
some wolves to shew themselves at the foot of the
mountains, being made ravenous for want of food,
the ground being covered with snow. We told
him we were well enough prepared for such crea-
tures as they were, if he would insure us from a
kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told
we were in most danger from, especially on the
French side of the mountains.
He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind
in the way that we were to go : so we readily
agreed to follow him : as did also twelve other
gentlemen, with their servants, some French, some
Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and
were obliged to come back again.
Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna,
with our guide, on the fifteenth of November,
and indeed, I was surprised, when, instead of
going forward, he came directly back with us, on
the same road that we came from Madrid, above
twenty miles; when having passed two rivers, and
come into the plain country, we found ourselves
in a warm climate again, where the country was
pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden,
turning to the left, he approached the mountains
another way; and though it is true, the hills and
the precipices looked dreadfully, yet he made so
many tours, such meanders, and led us by such
winding ways, we insensibly passed the height of
the mountains, without being much incumbered
with the snow; and all on a sudden he shewed us
the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedoc and
Gascoigne, all green and flourishing; though in-
deed they were at a great distance, and we had
some rough way to pass yet.
We were a little uneasy, however, when we found
D D 4
it snowed one whole day and a night, so fast, that
we could not travel; but he bid us be easy, we
should soon be past it all. We found, indeed, that
we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before; and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on. -
'. It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being something before us, and not just in
sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and after
them a bear, out of an hollow way, adjoining to a
thick wood: two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he
had been devoured indeed, before we could have
helped him : one of them fastened upon his horse,
and the other attacked the man with that violence
that he had not time, or not presence of mind
enough, to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried
out to us most lustily. My man Friday being next
to me, I bid him ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the
man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, O master!
O master! But, like a bold fellow, rode directly up
to the man, and with his pistol shot the wolf that
attacked him in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my
man Friday; for he, having been used to that kind
of creature in his country, had no fear upon him,
but went close up to him, and shot him as above;
whereas any of us would have fired at a further
distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf,
or endangered shooting the man.
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 409
- But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company,
when, with the noise of Friday's pistol, we heard
on both sides the dismallest howlings of wolves, and
the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious
multitude of them; and perhaps indeed there was
not such a few, as that we had no cause of ap-
prehensions. -
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the
other, that had fastened upon the horse, left him
immediately, and fled, having happily fastened
upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle had
stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him
much hurt: the man, indeed, was most hurt; for
the raging creature had bit him twice, once on
the arm, and the other time a little above his knee;
and he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up, and
shot the wolf.
It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's
pistol we all mended our pace, and rid up as fast
as the way (which was very difficult) would give
us leave, to see what was the matter: as soon as
we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how
Friday had disengaged the poor guide; though
we did not presently discern what kind of creature
it was he had killed. -
But never was a fight managed so hardily, and
in such a surprising manner, as that which fol-
lowed between Friday and the bear, which gave
us all (though at first we were surprised and afraid
for him) the greatest diversion imaginable; as the
bear is an heavy, clumsy creature, and does not
gallop as the wolf does, which is swift and light;
so he has two particular qualities, which generally
are the rule of his actions; first as to men, who
are not his proper prey, I say not his proper prey,
because though I cannot say what excessive hun-
ger might do, which was now their case, the
ground being all covered with snow; yet as to
men, he does not usually attempt them, unless they
first attack him; on the contrary, if you meet him
in the woods, if you do not meddle with him, he
will not meddle with you; yet then you must take
care to be very civil to him, and give him the
road; for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not
go a step out of the way for a prince; nay, if you
are really afraid, your best way is to look another
way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if you
stop, and stand still, and look stedfastly at him, he
takes it for an affront; and if you throw or toss
any thing at him, and it hits him, though it were
but a bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it
for an affront, and sets all other business aside to
pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in
point of honour, and this is his first quality; the
next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never
leave you, night or day, till he has his revenge,
but follow at a good round rate till he overtakes
you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his horse; for the man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the last more than the first;
when, on a sudden, we espied the bear come out
of the wood, and a very monstrous one it was, the
biggest by far that ever I saw : we were all a little
surprised when we saw him; but when Friday saw
him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the
fellow’s countenance: O! O! O! says Friday, three
times, pointing to him, O master! you give me te
leave, me shakee te hand with him, me makee you
good laugh.
I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased.
You fool you, said I, he will eat you up. Eatee
me up! eatee me up! says Friday, twice over again;
Mee eatee him up; me make you good laugh; you
all stay here, me shew you good laugh: so down
he sits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and
put on a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes
they wear) and which he had in his pocket, and
gives my other servant his horse, and, with his gun,
away he flew, swift like the wind.
The bear was walking softly on, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could understand him :
Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me speakee wityou.
We followed at a distance; for now being come
down to the Gascoigne side of the mountains, we
were entered a vast great forest, where the country
was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in it
scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the
bear, came up with him quickly, and takes up a
great stone, and throws at him, and hit him just on
the head; but did him no more harm than if he had
thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday's
end; for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did
it purely to make the bear follow him, and shew us
some laugh, as he called it.
As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking de-
vilish long strides, and shuffling along at a strange
rate, so as he would put an horse to a middling
gallop : away runs Friday, and takes his course, as
if he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved
to fire at once upon the bear, and deliver my man;
though I was angry at him heartily for bringing
the bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own business another way; and especially I
was angry that he had turned the bear upon us,
and then run away; and I called out, You dog,
said I, is this your making us laugh? Come away,
and take your horse, that we may shoot the crea-
ture. He hears me, and cries out, No shoot, no
shoot, stand still, you get much laugh: and as the
nimble creature ran two feet for the beast's one,
he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, and see-
ing a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beck-
oned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and we fol-
lowed at a distance; the first thing he did, he
stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and
up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a cat,
though so monstrous heavy. I was amazed at the
folly, as I thought it, of my man, and could not
for my life see any thing to laugh at yet, till see-
ing the bear get up the tree, we all rode nearer to
him. -
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the small of a large limb of the tree, and
the bear got about half way to him; as soon as the
bear got out to that part where the limb of the
tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, now you see
me teachee the bear dance; so he falls a jumping,
and shaking the bough, at which the bear began
to totter, but stood still, and began to look behind
him, to see how he should get back; then indeed
we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done
with him by a great deal: when he sees him stand
still, he calls out to him again, as if he had sup-
posed the bear could speak English, What, you
come no further? Pray you come further. So he
left jumping and shaking the bough; and the bear,
just as if he understood what he said, did come a
little further; then he fell a jumping again, and
the bear stopped again. -
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the head, and called to Friday to stand still,
and we would shoot the bear; but he cried out
earnestly, O pray ! O pray! no shoot, me shoot
by and then; he would have said, by and bye.
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so
much and the bear stood so ticklish, that we had
laughing enough indeed, but still could not ima-
gine what the fellow would do; for first we thought
he depended upon shaking the bear off; and we
found the bear was too cunning for that too; for
he would not get out far enough to be thrown
down, but clings fast with his great broad claws.
and feet, so that we could not imagine what
would be the end of it, and where the jest would
be at last.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for
seeing the bear cling fast to the bough, and that
he would not be persuaded to come any further,
Well, well, said Friday, you no come further,
me go, me go; you no come to me, me come to
you ; and upon this he goes out to the smallest
end of the bough, where it would bend with his
weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding
down the bough till he came near enough to jump
down on his feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes
it up, and stands still.
Well, said I to him, Friday, what will you do
now P Why don't you shoot him: No shoot, says
Friday, no yet; me shoot now me no kill; me stay,
give you one more laugh; and indeed so he did, as
you will see presently; for when the bear saw his
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough
where he stood, but did it mighty leisurely,
looking behind him every step, and coming back-
ward till he got into the body of the tree; then
with the same hinder end foremost, he came down
the tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving
one foot at a time, very leisurely; at this junc-
ture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon
the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped
the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him
as dead as a stone.
Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did
not laugh; and when he saw we were pleased by
our looks, he falls a laughing himself very loud;
So we kills bear in my country, says Friday. So
you kill them, said I; why you have no guns.
No, says he, no guns, but shoot great much long
OF ROBINSON CHRUSOE. 415
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us, but we
were still in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howl-
ing of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed
except the noise I once heard on the shore of
Africa, of which I have said something already, I
never heard any thing that filled me with so much
horror.
These things, and the approach of night, called
us off, or else, as Friday would have had us, we
should certainly have taken the skin of this mon-
strous creature off, which was worth saving; but
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened
us; so we left him, and went forward on our jour-
ney.
The ground was still covered with snow, though
not so deep and dangerous as on the mountains;
and the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards,
were come down into the forest and plain country,
pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done
a great deal of mischief in the villages, where
they surprised the country people, killed a great
many of their sheep and horses, and some people
too. .
We had one dangerous place to pass, of which
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves
in the country, we should find them there; and
this was a small plain, surrounded with woods on
every side, and along narrow defile or lane, which
we were to pass to get through the wood, and then
we should come to the village where we were to
lodge. -
It was within half an hour of sunset when we
entered the first wood; and a little after sunset
when we came into the plain. We met with no-
thing in the first wood, except that in a little plain
within the wood, which was not above two furlongs
over, we saw five great wolves cross the road, full
speed one after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in view; they took
no notice of us, and were gone and out of sight in a
few moments. - -
Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a
ready posture; for he believed there were more
wolves a coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we saw no more wolves till we came through
that wood, which was near half a league, and en-
tered the plain; as soon as we came into the plain,
we had occasion enough to look about us. The
first object we met with was a dead horse, that is
to say, a poor horse which the wolves had killed,
and at least a dozen of them at work; we could
not say eating of him, but picking of his bones
rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their
feast, neither did they take much notice of us.
Friday would have let fly at them, but I would
not suffer him by any means; for I found we were
like to have more business upon our hands than
we were aware of. We were not half gone over
the plain, but we began to hear the wolves howl
in the woods, on our left, in a frightful manner;
and presently after we saw about an hundred com-
ing on directly towards us, all in a body, and most
of them in a line, as regularly as an army drawn
up by experienced officers. I scarce knew in
what manner to receive them ; but found to draw.
ourselves in a close line, was the only way; so we
formed in a moment; but, that we might not have
too much interval, I ordered, that only every other
man should fire; and that the others, who had not
fired, should stand ready to give them a second
volley immediately, if they continued to advance
upon us; and that then those who had fired at
first, should not pretend to load their fusils again,
but stand ready, with every one a pistol, for we
WOL. I. E E
were all armed with a fusil, and a pair of pistols
each man; so we were, by this method, able to
fire six volleys, half of us at a time; however, at
present we had no necessity; for, upon firing the
first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being
terrified, as well with the noise as with the fire;
four of them being shot in the head, dropped;
several others were wounded, and went bleeding
off, as we could see by the snow: I found they
stopped, but did not immediately retreat; where-
upon remembering that I had been told, that the
fiercest creatures were terrified at the voice of a
man, I caused all our company to halloo as loud
as we could, and I found the notion not altogether
mistaken ; for upon our shout, they began to
retire, and turn about; then I ordered a second
volley to be fired in their rear, which put them to
the gallop, and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might lose no time, we kept going;
but we had but little more than loaded our fusils,
and put ourselves into a readiness, when we heard
a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left; only
that it was further onward the same way we were
to go.
The night was coming on, and the light began
to be dusky, which made it the worse on our side;
but the noise increasing, we could easily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of those hell-
ish creatures; and, on a sudden, we perceived two
or three troops of wolves on our left, one behind
us, and one on our front, so that we seemed to be
surrounded with them; however, as they did not
fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as
we could make our horses go, which, the way
being very rough, was only a good large trot; and
in this manner we came in view of the entrance of
a wood through which we were to pass, at the
further side of the plain: but we were greatly sur-
prised, when coming nearer the lane, or pass, we
saw a confused number of wolves standing just at
the entrance. -
On a sudden, at another opening of the wood,
we heard the noise of a gun; and, looking that
way, out rushed an horse, with a saddle and a
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen
or seventeen wolves after him full speed; indeed
the horse had the heels of them; but as we sup-
posed that he could not hold it at that rate, we
doubted not but they would get up with him at
last; and no question but they did. -
Here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up
to the entrance where the horse came out, we found
the carcase of another horse, and of two men de-
voured by the ravenous creatures, and one of the
men was no doubt the same whom we heard
fire a gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off;
but as to the man, his head, and the upper part of
his body, were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not
what course to take; but the creatures resolved
us soon, for they gathered about us presently, in
E E 2
hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were:
three hundred of them. It happened very much.
to our advantage, that at the entrance into the
wood, but a little way from it, there lay some large
timber trees, which had been cut down the sum-
mer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage;
I drew my little troop in among those trees, and:
placing ourselves in a line behind one long tree, I
advised them all to alight, and, keeping that tree.
before us, for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle,
or three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre. .
We did so, and it was well we did ; for never
was a more furious charge than the creatures made
upon us in this place; they came on us with a
growling kind of noise, and mounted the piece
of timber (which, as I said, was our breast-work,)
as if they were only rushing upon their prey; and
this fury of theirs, it seems, was principally occa-
sioned by their seeing our horses behind us, which
was the prey they aimed at: "I ordered our men to
fire as before, every other man; and they took their
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the
wolves at the first volley; but there was a neces-
sity to keep a continual firing, for they came on
like devils, those behind pushing on those be-
fore. *
When we had fired our second volley of fusils,
we thought they stopped a little, and I hoped they
would have gone off, but it was but a moment, for
others came forward again; so we fired two volleys
of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings,
we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and
lamed twice as many; yet they came on again.
I was loth to spend our last shot too hastily; so
I called my servant, not my man Friday, for he
was better employed; for, with the greatest dex-
terity imaginable, he had charged my fusil and his
own, while we were engaged; but, as I said, I
called my other man; and giving him a horn of
powder, I bade him lay a train all along the piece
of timber, and let it be a large train; he did so,
and had but just time to get away, when the
wolves came up to it, and some were got up upon
it ; when I, snapping an uncharged pistol close to
the powder, set it on fire; and those that were
upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or
seven of them fell, or rather jumped in among us,
with the force and fright of the fire; we dis-
patched these in an instant, and the rest were so
frighted with the light, which the night, for now it
was very near dark, made more terrible, that they
drew back a little.
Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be
fired off in one volley, and after that we gave a
shout; upon this the wolves turned tail, and we
sallied immediately upon near twenty lame ones,
which we found struggling on the ground, and
fell a cutting them with our swords, which an-
swered our expectation; for the crying and howl-
ing they made were better understood by their
fellows; so that they fled and left us.
We had, first and last, killed about threescore
E E 3
of them; and had it been day-light, we had killed
many more. The field of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again, for we had still near a
league to go; we heard the ravenous creatures
howl and yell in the woods as we went, several
times; and sometimes we fancied we saw some of
them, but the snow dazzling our eyes, we were
not certain; so in about an hour more we came to
the town where we were to lodge, which we found
in a terrible fright, and all in arms; for, it seems,
that, the night before, the wolves and some bears
had broke into the village, and put them in a
terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep
guard night and day, but especially in the night,
to preserve their cattle, and indeed their people.
. The next morning our guide was so ill, and his
limbs so swelled with the rankling of his two
wounds, that he could go no further; so we were
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Thou-
louse, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful,
pleasant country, and no snow, no wolves, or any
thing like them; but when we told our story at
Thoulouse, they told us it was nothing but what
was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the
mountains, especially when the snow lay on the
ground; but they inquired much what kind of a
guide we had gotten, that would venture to bring
us that way in such a severe season; and told us,
it was a great chance we were not all devoured.
When we told them how we placed ourselves, and
the horses in the middle, they blamed us exceed-
ingly, and told us it was fifty to one but we had
been all destroyed; for it was the sight of the
horses that, made the wolves so furious, seeing
their prey; and that at other times they are really
afraid of a gun; but they being excessive hungry,
and raging on that account, the eagerness to come
at the horses had made them senseless of danger;
and that if we had not by the continued fire, and
at last by the stratagem of the train of powder,
mastered them, it had been great odds but that we
had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been
content to have sat still on horseback, and fired
as horsemen, they would not have taken the horses
so much for their own, when men were on their
backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that
at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our
horses, they would have been so eager to have
devoured them, that we might have come off safe,
especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and
being so many in number.
For my part, I was never so sensible of danger
in my life; for seeing above three hundred devils
come roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and
having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I gave
myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe, I
shall never care to cross those mountains again; I
think I would much rather go a thousand leagues
by sea, though I were sure to meet with a storm
once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through France; nothing but what
E E 4
other travellers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than I can. I travelled from
Thoulouse to Paris, and without any considerable
stay, came to Calais, and landed safe at Dover,
the fourteenth of January, after having had a
severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of my travels,
and had in a little time all my new discovered
estate safe about me, the bills of exchange, which
I brought with me, having been very currently
paid. -
My principal guide and privy counsellor, was
my good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the
money I had sent her, thought no pains too much,
or care too great, to employ for me; and I trusted
her so entirely with every thing, that I was per-
fectly easy as to the security of my effects; and
indeed I was very happy from my beginning, and
now to the end, in the unspotted integrity of this
good gentlewoman.
And now I began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and
so to the Brasils: but now another scruple came
in the way, and that was religion; for as I had
entertained some doubts about the Roman religion,
even while I was abroad, especially in my state of
solitude; so I knew there was no going to the
Brasils for me, much less going to settle there, un-
less I resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic re-
ligion, without any reserve; except on the other
hand I resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles,
be a martyr for religion, and die in the Inquisition:
so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find
means for it, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Lis-
bon, who in return gave me notice, that he could
easily dispose of it there : but that if I thought
fit to give him leave to offer it in my name to the
two merchants, the survivors of my trustees who
lived in the Brasils, who must fully understand the
value of it, who lived just upon the spot, and who
I knew to be very rich, so that he believed they
would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt,
but I should make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the
more of it. . -
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer
it to them, and he did so ; and in about eight
months more, the ship being then returned, he
sent me an account, that they had accepted the
offer, and had remitted 83,000 pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to
my old man, who sent me the bills of exchange
for 82,800 pieces of eight for the estate; reserving
the payment of 100 moidores a year, to him (the
old man) during his life, and 50 moidores after-
wards to his son for his life, which I had promised
them; and which the plantation was to make good
as a rent-charge. And thus I have given the first
part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of
Providence's chequer-work, and of a variety which
the world will seldom be able to shew the like of:
beginning foolishly, but closing much more hap-
pily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much
as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards, and so indeed I had been, if other circum-
stances had concurred: but I was inured to a
wandering life, had no family, not many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much ac-
quaintance; and though I had sold my estate in
the Brasils, yet I could not keep that country out
of my head, and had a great mind to be upon the
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong
inclination I had to see my island, and to know if
the poor Spaniards were in being there; and how
the rogues I left there had used them.
My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded
me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that
almost for seven years she prevented my running
abroad; during which time I took my two nephews,
the children of one of my brothers, into my care :
the eldest having something of his own, I bred up
as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of some
addition to his estate, after my decease; the other
I put out to a captain of a ship; and after five
years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising
young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and sent
him to sea: and this young fellow afterwards drew
me in, as old as I was, to further adventures
myself.
In the mean time, I in part settled myself here:
for, first of all, I married, and that not either to my
disadvantage or dissatisfaction, and had three chil-
dren, two sons and one daughter: but my wife
dying, and my nephew coming home with good
success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to
go abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and en-
gaged me to go in his ship as a private trader to the
East Indies. This was in the year 1694.
In this voyage I visited my new colony in the
island, saw my successors the Spaniards, had the
whole story of their lives, and of the villains I left
there; how at first they insulted the poor Spaniards,
how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united,
separated, and how at last the Spaniards were
obliged to use violence with them; how they were
subjected to the Spaniards; how honestly the
Spaniards used them; an history, if it were entered
into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as
my own part; particularly also as to their battles
with the Caribbeans, who landed several times
upon the island, and as to the improvement they
made upon the island itself; and how five of them
made an attempt upon the main land, and brought
away eleven men and five women prisoners; by
which, at my coming, I found about twenty young
children on the island.
Here I stayed about twenty days; left them
supplies of all necessary things, and particularly of
arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two work-
men, which Ibrought from England with me; viz.
a carpenter and a smith. . . - .
• Besides this, I shared the land into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts, respectively, as they
agreed on; and having settled all things with them,
and engaged them not to leave the place, I left
them there. - . . . . .
From thence I touched at the Brasils, from
whence I sent a bark, which I bought there, with
more people, to the island; and in it, besides other
supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I
found proper for service, or for wives to such as
would take them. As to the Englishmen, I pro-
mised them to send them some women from Eng-
land, with a good cargo of necessaries, if they
would apply themselves to planting; which I after-
wards performed: and the fellows proved very
honest and diligent, after they were mastered,
and had their properties set apart for them. I
sent them also from the Brasils five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some
hogs, which, when I came again, were considerably
increased.
But all these things, with an account how 300
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their
plantations, and how they fought with that whole
number twice, and were at first defeated and three
of them killed; but at last a storm destroying their
enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed almost
all the rest, and renewed and recovered the posses-
sion of their plantation, and still lived upon the
island.
All these things, with some very surprising inci-
dents in some new adventures of my own, for ten
years more, I may, perhaps, give a further account
of hereafter.
