----------o<<-------

 

DANIEL FOE, or, as he subse-
quently styled himself (though
at what time and on what occa-
sion is not known), De Foe,
was born in the parish of St.

in the year 1661. The earliest
' of his ancestors of. whom there
is any account, was Daniel Foe,
a ycoman, who farmed his own
estate at Elton, in Northamp-
onshire. He maintained a pack of hounds; from whence it
f ay be reasonably inferred that his means were above com-
etcncy. A custom of the times in bestowing party names
n brutes is thus mentioned by our author. "I remember,"
, e says, "my grandfather had a huntsman that used the
".ame familiarity with his dogs; and he had his Roundhead,
.pznd his Cavalier, and his Goring, and his Waller, and all the

 

 
    
    
    
 

: imes turning, the old gentleman was fain to scatter his pack,
nd make them up of more dog-like surnames. " It is from
is grandfather that De Foe is supposed to have inherited-

i

landed property: for m his " Review," a work we shall often-

,' enerals of both armies were hounds in his pack; till the -

I
l
l
i
i
l
have occasion to consult, he says, " I have both a native and
an acquired right of election." Our author's father, James
Foe, followed the trade of butcher, in St. Griles's, Cripplegate:
and these few barren facts are all that is to be gathered of
the ancestors of Daniel De Foe. "He had," says Mr. Wil-
son, in his excellent work, "The Life and Times of Daniel
De Foe," a work abounding with the most curious and
minute information on the period of which it treats--"He
had some collateral relatives, to whom he alludes occasion-
ally in his writings, but with too much brevity to ascertain
the degree of kindred."

At an early age, Dc Foe is said to have shown that vivac-
ity of humour, and that indomitable spirit of independence,
that rem'incd with him through after life, "making a sun-
shine in the shady place" of a prison, and arming him as the
champion of truth in humanity in the most perilous times.
An anecdote related by our author is illustrative of the dis-
cipline that governed the home of his boyhood. During that
part of the reign of Charles II. when the nation feared the
ascendancy of Popery, and it was expected that printed
Bibles would become rare, many honest people employed
themselves in copying the Bible into short-hand. To this
task young De Foe 'emp10yed himself; and he tells us that

_ "he worked like a horse till he had written out the whole of '

l
i

a the Pentateuch, when he grew so tired that he was willing

to risk the rest." The parents of De Foe were non-conform-
ii
  
 
   
  
  
   

ists, and his education was consonant to the practice of that
' faith. Family religion formed an essential part of its diSci-
plinc; and it was made matter of conscience to instruct the
children of a family and its dependents in their social,
moral, and religious duties.

Although the enemies of De Foe vainly endeavoured to
sink his reputation by representing him as having been bred
a tradesman, there is ample evidence to prove that he was
' originally intended for one of the learned professions.* When
" he had, therefore, sufficiently qualified under inferior tutors. "
The was, at about fourteen years of age, placed in an academy
I at Newington Green, under the direction of "that polite and '
profound scholar," the Reverend Charles Morton, who was '_
' subsequently defended by his pupil, some aspersions having
been cast upon the character of the master by an ungrateful
scholar who had deserted to the church. De Foe writes, " I
must do that learned gentleman's memory the justice to affirm,
r that neither in his system of politics, government, and disci-
pline, nor in any other of the exercises of that school, was
there any thing taught or encouraged that was anti-monarch-
ical or destructive to the constitution of England? ..

Of De Fee's progress under Mr. Morton, it is impossible-1f

* "It is not often," says De Foe, in his Review, vi. 841, " that I trouble you, )
with any of my divinity; the pulpit is, none of my office. It was my disaster
first to be set apart for, and then to be set apart from, the honour of that sacred
'rmploy." _ . .; ' "2,3

' iii
now to speak with any certainty. He tells us in one of his
" Reviews" that he had been master of five languages, and
that he had studied the mathematics, natural philosophy,
logic, geography, and history: he was one of the few who,
in those days, studied politics as a science. He went through
a. complete course of theology, and his knowledge of ecclesias-
tical history was also considerable. He was, however, at-
tacked by party malice as " an illiterate person without
education." To this he calmly makes answer :---"'l'hose
gentlemen who reproach my learning to applaud their own,
shall have it proved that I have more learning than either of
them--because I have more manners." He adds, " I think
I owe this justice to my excellent Either still living (1705),
and in whose behalf I fully testify, that it' I am a blockhead,
it is nobody's fault but my own." He proceeds to challenge
his slanderer "to translate with me any Latin, French and
Italian author, and after that to retranslate them erossways,
for twenty pounds each book- and by this he shall have an
opportunity to show ti 2 world how in uch Dc Foe, the hosier,
is inferior in learning to Mr. Tutchin, the gentleman."

At one-and-twenty, De Foe commenced the perilous trade
----most perilous in his day of author; at the which he 13.-
boured through good and through evil report, with lasting
honour to himself, and emluring benefit. to mankind, for half a.
century. It is now ascertained that Do Fee's first publication
Was a lampooning answer to " L'Estrangc's Guide to the

1V
' Inferior Clergy," and bore the following quaint title :--
'Speculum Crape-Gownorum; or, a. Looking-Glass for the
Young Academicks new Foyl'd; with Reflections on some
,. of the late High Flown Sermons: to which is added, an Essay
towards a Sermon of the Newest Fashion. By a. Guide to
the Inferiour Clergie. Ridentem discere Verum Quis Vetat.
London: printed for E. Rydal. 1682." This title De Foe
: borrowed from the crepe gowns then usually worn by the
T nferior clergy; and, in the book, he fights the fight of- the
,5: Dissenters against what he terms the libels of the established
if clergy. " rl'he fertility of the subject," says Mr. Wilson, "soon
)roduced a. second part of the 'Speculum ;' in which the
author deals more seriously with the government, and, by a
practical view of the effect of persecution, exposed its
absurdity."
We have entered more at length into the nature and pur-
j pose of De Fee's first book, than will be permitted to us by
our limits to do with each of the works that now followed, in
' rapid profusion, from the pen of our author. All that we
. purpose to ourselves is, to give the strongest outlines of his
character--the principal events of his career: and, avoiding
on one hand a jejune brevity, that confines itself to mere
dates, attempt not, on the other side, a minute description of
events incompatible with our present object.
' When the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme, De Foe

was among those who joined the standard of the hapless
. v '
nobleman. " A romantic kind of invasion," says Welwood,
"and scarcely paralleled in history." At the age of four.
and-twenty, we see De Foe, the author of "Robinson Crusoe,"
a soldier; as ready with his sword as prompt with his pen, in
the cause of rational liberty. Of Monmouth, De Foe seems
to have had some previous knowledge, having often seen him
at Aylesbury races, where the duke rode his own horses, a
circumstance alluded to by our author in his " Tour." De
Foe had the good fortune to escape the vengeance visited upon
so many of the duke's supporters, and returned in safety to
London; where, leaving the stormy region of politics, he now
directed his attention to trade. The nature of his business
has been variously represented. In several publications of
the time, he is styled a " hosier;" but, if we may believe his
own account, he was ahose~lhetor, or, the middle-man between
the manufacturer and the retail-dealer. This agency concern
he carried on for some years, in Freeman's-court, Cornhill;
Mr. Chalmers says, from 1685 to 1695. On the 26th of
January, 1687-8, having claimed his freedom by birth, he
was admitted a liveryman of London. In the Chamberlain's
book, his name was written "Daniel Foe."

"Then the Revolution took place, De Foe was a. residen
in Tooting, in Surrey, where he was the first person who at-
tempted to form the Dissent-ers in the neighbourhood into a
regular congregation. De Foe was for many years a resident
in this part of Surrey; it is likely that he had a country-

V1
  
   
    
   
   
  
   
  
  
     
  

house there during the time that he carried on his hose-agency
in Cornhill. De Foe was one of the most ardent worshippers
i; of the Revolution: he annually commemorated the 4th of
l I rovexnber as a day of deliverance. "A day," says he,
'famous on various accounts, and every one of them dear to
, Britons who love their country, value the Protestant interest,
f r have an aversion to tyranny and oppression. On this day,
". e (King William) was born; on this day, he married the
kraughter of England; and on this day, he rescued the nation
PS2" om a bondage worse than that of Egypt; a bondage of soul,
s well as bodily servitude; a slavery to the ambition and
aging lust of a generation set on fire by pride, avarice, cruelty
nd blood." In order to do honour to the king, and add to
l e splendour of the procession, on the royal visit to Guildhall,
. any of the citizens volunteered to attend William as a '
uard of honour on the occasion. Among these was Daniel
e Foe.

The commercial speculations of our author, though at the
rst prosperous, were ultimately unsuccessful. That they
ere of a various character, is evident from the fact of his
Vi avin g engaged with partners in the Spanish and Portuguese
rade. It is very clear, from a passage in his "Review," that
he had been a merchant-adventurer. In the number for
<,_ January 27,1711, he alludes to an old Spanish proverb,
"which, " says he, "I learnt when I was in that country"

; It further appears, that while residing there, he made himself
' vii
a master of the language. De Fee's losses by shipwreck ap-
pear to have been very considerable. The occupations of
trade, however, according to De Fee's own confession, assert
ill with literary feelings. "A wit turned tradesmanl" he
cxclaims; no "apron-strings will hold him: 'tis in vain to
lock him in behind the counter; he's gone in a. moment."
He concludes :--" A statute of bankrupt is his Exeunt Omnes,
and he generally speaks the epilogue in the Fleet Prison, or
Mint."

In allusion to the misfortunes of our author, Mr. Chalmers
observes:--" With the usual imprudence of genius, he was
carried into companies who were gratified by his wit. He
spent those hours with a small society for the cultivation of
polite learning, which he ought to have employed in the cal-
culations of the counting-house; and, being obliged to ab-
,sconcl from his creditors in 1692, he naturally attributed those
misfortunes to the war, which were probably owing to his
own misconduct. An angry creditor took out a commission
of bz'tnkruptcy, which was soon superseded, on the petition
of those to whom he wa. most indebted, who accepted a com-
position on his single bond. This he punctually paid, by the
efforts of unwearied diligence; but some of these creditors,
who had been thus satisfied, falling afterwards into distress
themselves, De Foe voluntarily paid them their whole claim,
being then in rising circumstances, in consequence of King
"William's favour." De Foe, being subsequently reproached

V111
  
 
 
   
  
  
  
   
 
   
  
   
   
  

I by Lord Haversham for mercenary conduct, he tells him, in
_ 1705, that, " with a numerous family, and no help but his
f." 0an industry, he had forced his way, with undiscouraged
' diligence, through a set of misfortunes, and reduced his debts
exclusive of composition, from seventeen thousand to less
_ than five thousand pounds."

I It deserves to be remembered that, in the time of De Foe,
1 our laws against bankrupts were as inhuman as they were
oolish. "The cruelty of our laws against debtors," says De
oe, " without distinction of honest or dishonest, is the shame
f our nation. I am persuaded, the honestest man in Eng-
and, when by necessity he is compelled to break, will early
y out of the kingdom rather than submit. To stay here,
his is the consequence: as soon as he breaks, he is proscribed
as a criminal, and has thirty to sixty days to surrender 'both
himself and all that he has to his creditors. If he fails to do
t, he has nothing before him but the gallows, without benefit
T of clergy; if he surrenders, he is not sure but he shall be
thrown into gaol for life by the commissioners, only on pre-
' tenee that they doubt his oath! What must the man do?"
: We have reformed a great deal of this in our days, yet some-
. thing remains undone, for the bankrupt is still too much left
at the mercy of the malevolent or ignorant creditor.

, It is certain that De Foe, whilst under apprehension from
3 his creditors, resided some time at Bristol. "A friend of

- mine in that city," says Mr. Wilson, "informs me that one-
ix
of his ancestors remembered De Foe, and sometimes saw him
walking in the streets of Bristol, accoutred in the fashion of
the times, with a fine flowing wig, lace ruffles, and a sword
by his side: also, that he there obtained the name of 'the
Sunday gentleman,' because, through fear of the bailiffs, he
did not dare to appear in public upon any other day." De
Foe was wont to visit "The Red Lion," kept by one Mark
Watkins, who, in after times, used to entertain his company
with an account of a singular personage, who made his ap-
pearance in Bristol, clothed in goatskins, in which dress he
was in the habit of walking the streets, and went by the name
of Alexander Selkirk, or Robinson Crusoe! It was during
this retreat from London that De Foe wrotehis celebrated
"Essay upon Projects," though he did not publish it until
nearly five years afterwards.

It appears that at this time De Foe was invited, by some
merchants of his acquaintance residing in Cadiz, to settle in
Spain, with the offer of a. good commission: " but," says our
author, " Providence, which had other work for me to do,
placed a secret aversion in my mind to quitting England
upon any account, and made me refuse the best oifer of that
kind, to be concerned with some eminent persons at borne, in
proposing ways and means to the government for raising
money to supply the occasion of the war,'then newly begun.'
De Foe suggested a. general assessment of personal property,

the amount to he settled by composition, under the inspec-
I
tion of commissioners appointed by the king. It was, doubt
less, owing to these services, that De Foe was appointed to
the office of accountant to the commissioners of the glass duty,
in 1695: the commission ceased in 1699. It was probably
about this time that De Foe became secretary to the tile-kiln
and brick-kiln works at Tilbury, in Essex. Pantiles had '
been hitherto a Dutch manufacture, and were brought in
large quantities to England. To supersede the necessity of
their importation, these works were erected. The specula-
tion proved unsuccessful, De Foe himself losing by its failure
. no less than three thousand pounds. He continued the
i works, it is believed, until the year 1703, when, being deb
. prived of his liberty for a libel, the undertaking came to an
; 1 end. _
.- Towards the close of the war, in 1696--7, De Foe gave to
he world his " Essay upon Projects ;" a work alike admirap
10 for the novelty of the subject, and the elearness and in>>
euuity with which it is treated. The projects of our author
2- ay be classed under the heads of politics, commerce, and
enevolence; all having some reference to the public. in>>
Movement. The first relates to banks in general, and to the
, oyal or national bank in particular, which he wishes to be
rendered subservient to the relief of the merchant, and the'

  
    
   
 
  
 
  
   
 
  

his next proj ect relates to highways; a third, to the improve-
~n ent of the bankrupt laws; a fourth, to the plan of friendly
xi
societies, formed by mutual assurance, for the relief of the
members in seasons of distress; a fifth, for the establishment
of an asylum for " fools," or, more properly, " naturals,"
Whom he describes as "a particular rent-charge on the great
family of mankind :" he next suggests the formation of acade-
mies, to supply some neglected branches of education; one
of these was for the improvement of the English tongue, "to
polish and refine it ;" and this project combined a reforma-
tion of that "foolish vice," swearing: the next project of our
author was an academy for military studies; and, under the
head of " Academics," he suggested an institution for the
education of females:--"\Ve reproach the sex every day,"
says he, " with folly and impertinence, while, I am confident,
had they the advantages of education equal to us, they would
be guilty of less than ourselves."

In January, 1700--1, appeared De Foe's celebrated poem
of " The Trueborn Englishman? It was composed in answer
to "a vile, abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verse, written by
one Mr. Tutchin, and called 'The Foreigners,' in which the
author--who he then was I knew not," says De Foe--" fell
personally upon the king and the Dutch nation." How many
thousands, familiar with the following, new nroverbial lines
new not that with them opens " The 'l'rueborn Englishman l"

" Wherever God erects a house of prayer,
The devil always builds a chapel there;
And 'twill be found, upon examination,
The latter has the largest congregation!"

De Foe traces the rise of our ancient families to the Nor
man invader, who cantoned out the country to his followers,
and " every soldier was a denizen." The folly of indulging.
this pride of ancestry is finely painted in the following
lines :--

" These are the heroes who despise the Dutch,
And rail at new-come foreigners so much;
Forgetting that themselves are all derived
From the most scoundrol race that ever lived.
A horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones,
Who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopled towns;
The Pict and painted Briton, treach'rous Scot,
By hunger, theft, and rupine hither brought;
Norwegian pirates, bnccaneering Danes,
Fir/lose red-haired qfoyring everywhere remains;
Who, joined with Norman-French, compound the breed---
From whence your True-Born Englishmen proceed.
And lest by length of time it be pretended
The climate may the modern race have mended,
Wise Providence, to keep us where we are,
Mixes us daily with exceeding care."

Foe concludes with the following striking lines :--"

" Could but our ancestors retrieve their fate,
And see their ofi'spring thus degenerate;
How we contend for birth and names unknown,
And build on their past actions, not our own,
They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface,
4nd then disown the rile. degenerate nice;
' Xlll
For fame of families is all a cheat,
'Tis pessom VIB'I'UR ONLY MAKES us can-r."

"When I see the town full of lampoons and invectives
against Dutchmen," says De Foe, in his "Explanatory Pro-
,face," " only because they are foreigners, and. the king re-
proached and insulted by insolent pedants and billad-mak-
ing poets, for employing foreigners, and being a foreigner
' himself, I confess myself moved by it to remind our nation
of their own original, thereby to let them see what a banter
they put upon themselves; since, speaking of Englishmen,
ab orz'gz'ne, we are really all foreigners ourselves."

It is to this poem that De Foe was indebted for a personal
introduction to King l-Villiam. He was sent for to the palace
by his h-ilajesty, converscd with him, and had repeated inter- '
views with him afterwards. The manners and sentiments of
De Foe appeared to have made such a favourable impression
on the king, that he ever after regarded him with kindness;
and, conceiving that his talents might be turned to a beneficial
account, be employed him in many secret services, to which

' he alludes occasionally in his writings.

The effect produced upon the country by the satire was
most beneficial. De Foe himself, nearly thirty years after-
wards, writes, "National mistakes, vulgar errors, and even a
general practice, have been reformed by a just satire. None
of our countrymen have been known to boast of being True-
Bom'Englz'shmen, or so much as use the word as a title or zip

x1v '
pellation, ever since a late satire upon that national folly Was-
puhlished, though almost thirty years before."

In 1700--1, on the meeting of the fifth parliament of King,
William, we find De Foe strenuously engaged advocating the
necessity of settling the succession in the Protestant line; an
important object with William, as the only means of perpetui-
ating the benefits which the nation had reaped from the Rev-.-
olution. To this great end, De Foe devoted all his energies,"
labouring with unwearied zeal in the cause. ' His conduct On
the imprisonment of the Kentish gentlemen, whose names
are historically associated with the presentation of the famous
Kentish petition, was marked with all the intrepidity of his-1
character. The Commons had imprisoned the petitioners, ~
who prayed the House for the settlement of the Protestant,
succession, for having presented a petition "scandalous, inso-'
lent, and seditious." On this, De Foe drew up his celebrated
"Legion Paper." In what manner it was communicated to.
the House does not appear upon the journals. It was reported.-
at the time that De Foe, disguised as a woman, presented it
to the Speaker as he entered the House of Commons. The-
"Legion" petition rang like a tocsin throughout the king'-
dom. As, however, the author remained concealed, the>>
Commons did not think fit to pass any particular censure".
upon it. The Kentish petitioners were discharged by the
prorogation of parliament on the 24th of June: they were:
subsequently feasted at Mercers' Hall, where De Foe attended}

XV
"Next the Worthis," says a pamphlet of the time, " was
placed their secretary of state, the author of the 'Legion
Paper;' and one might have read the downfal of parliaments
in his very countenance."

By the death of King William, "more mortally wounded,'
says De Foe, "with the pointed rage of parties, and an un-
grateful people, than by the fall from his horse," our author
lost a kind friend and powerful protector. Toward the lat-
ter part of this reign, De Foe took up his abode at Hackney,
and resided there many years. Here some of his children
were born and buried. In the parish register is the following
entry:---- ---"Sophia, daughter to Daniel De Foe, by Mary his
wife, was baptised, December 24,1701." .

The next important work of De Foe--a work that ex-
ercised the greatest influence on his fortunes was the
"Shortest Way with the Dissenters; or, Proposals for the
Establishment of the Church; 1702." In this work, the
author, assuming the character of an Ultra High Churehman,
advocates the adoption of the severest measures against the

. Dissenters. "'Tis vain," writes De Fee, "to trifle in this
matter. The light, foolish handling of them by fines is
their glory and advantage. If the gallows instead of the
Icompter, and the oalle} s instead of the fines, were the reward
.of going to a conventiele, there would not be so many suf
ferers " These arguments found high favour with both the

Universities. The High Church Party never suspected the
xvi

i
sincerity of their partizan, and, charmed and won by the"
fierce doctrines of their champion, were unsuspicious of- the?
satire of their extravagance. It was, however, De Foe' s hard3'
fate to be misunderstood by both parties. Whilst the flight
Churchmen congratulated themselves on the addition egg-1'
another advocate, the Dissenters treated him as a- real enemyp
The Church Party, however, fell into the trap laid- for thera3
by De Foe; for, by expressing their delight at the fiery sen}
timents of the author, they av owed them as their own true.
feelings on the question. De Foe subsequently taunts th93
pmty thus: " We have innumerable testimonies," he sayg
" with which that party embraced the proposal of sending all;
the Dissenting ministers to the gallows and the galleys; of":
having all their meeting- houses demolished; and being let
loose upon the people to plunder and destroy them." 1&3
another place, De Foe chaiaeteristically portrays the 001111110113
fate of the subtlety of wit, when judged by the multitude.1
IIe say 5--" All the fault I can find with myself as to thee;
people (the Dissentcrs) 1s, that when I had drawn the picturefi;
I did not, like the Dutchman with his man and bear, vmtel
under them, ' This IS the man, 'and 'This is the bear,' 1113111th
people should mistake me; and having rr,in a compliment tea
their judgment, shunned so sharp a reflection upon theiig
senses, I have left them at liberty to treat me like one thug
put a value upon their penetration at the expense of In

own." The first detection of our author 18 said to have, 3 _,
2 xvii ' <<:3
o

owing to the industry of the Earl of Nottingham, one of the
secretaries of state. When the author's name was known,
people were at no loss to decipher his object; and those who
had committed themselves by launching forth in his praises
were stung with madness at their own folly. It was at once
resolved by the party in power to crush De Foe by a state
prosecution. In the height of the storm, our author sought
concealment; when a proclamation was issued by the Gov-
ernment, offering PS50 for the discovery of his retreat, and
advertised in "The London Gazette," for January 10, 1702-3.
It was as follows:

"Whereas, Daniel De Foe, alias De Fooe, is charged with
writing a scandalous and seditious pamphlet, entitled, 'The
Shortest Way with the Dissenters.' He is a. middle-sized,
spare man, about forty years old; of a. brown complexion,
and dark brown coloured hair, but wears a wig; a hook nose, \
a sharp chin, grey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth:
was born in London, and for many years was a hose-factor
in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill: and now is owner of the brick
and pantile works, near Tilbury Fort, in Essex: whoever
shall discover the said Daniel De Foe to one of her Majesty's
principal secretaries of state, or any of her Maj esty's justices
of peace, so he may be apprehended, shall have a reward of
505., which her Majesty has ordered immediately to be paid

@upon such discovery."

l11143110111 OF DE For;

In the House of Commons, it was resolved that the book-i

" be burnt by the hands of the common hangman- 1n Palace
Yar " The printer of the work and the bookseller being:
taken into custody, De Foe issued forth frOm his warmest;
to brave the storm, resolving, as he expresses it, "to throxi
himself upon the favour of: government, rather than thati
others should be ruined by his mistake." De Foe was " -::
dicted at the Old Bailey sessions, the 24th of February, 170
and proceeded to trial in the following July. It may'
gathered from his own account of the prosecution, that w "
his enemies had him in their power, they were at a loss"
know what to do with him. He was therefore advised 1
throw himself on the mercy of the Queen, with a promise of: -'
protection; which induced him to quit his defence, andi
acknowledge himself as the author of the offensive work;
On this, De Foe was sentenced to pay a fine of 200 marks tag
the Queen, to stand three times in the pillory, to be int-'1
prisoned during the Queen's pleasure, and to find sureties for
his good behaviour for seven years. i
The people, however, were with De Foe. Hence, he was
guarded to the pillory by the populace; and descended from:
it with the triumphant acclamations of the surrounding muL
titude De Foe has himself related, that "the people, who
were expected to treat him very ill, on the contrary, pmea
him, and wished those who set him there were placed 111' 'hfi

room, and expressed their affections by loud shouts and K
xix
clamations when he was taken down." Tradition reports
that the pillory was adorned with garlands, it being in the
middle of summer. The odium intended for De Foe fell
upon his persecutors, and the pillory became to him a place
of honour.

A triumphant evidence of the high spirit of De Foe---a
spirit elevated and strengthened by its unconquerable love of
truth--is manifested by the fact, that on the very day of his
exhibition to the people, he published "A Hymn to the Pil-
lory I" This poem, which successively passed through several
editions, being eagerly bought up by the people, opens nobly
as follows :--

" Hail! hieroglyphick state machine,
Contrived to punish fancy in ;
Men that are men, in the can, feel no pain,
And all thy insignificnnts disdain.
Contempt, that false new word for shame,
Is, without crime, an empty name;
A shadow to amuse mankind,

|_ But never {rights the wise or well-fixed mind;

5 Virtue despises human swrn,
' And scandals innocence Mom."

 
   

De Foe is now presented to us, stripped of his fortunes,
and a prisoner. In consequence of his imprisonment, he could
no longer attend to his pantile works, which produced the
chief source of his revenue, and they were consequently

, given up. By this afi'air he lost, as he himself informs us,
XX
PS3,500; and he had now a wife and six children dependent I
upon him, with no other resource for their support than the '
product of his pen. Hence the leisure of De Foe, whilst in
Newgate, was not that of idleness or dissipation. Some of
his subsequent writings leave no doubt that he now stored
his mind with those facts relative to the habits and pursuits ,
of the prisoners, which he has detailed with so much nature
as well as interest. A great part of his time was devoted to
the composition of political works which our limits will not
permit us to dwell upon. It was likewise whilst in Newgate
that he projected his "Review," a periodical work of four
quarto pages, which was published for nine successive years
without intermission; during the greater part of the time,
three times a. week, and without having received any assist-
ance whatever in its production. Throughout this work, he--
carried on an unsparing warfare against folly and vice in all
their disguises: it pointed the way to the " Tattlers," " Spec-
tators," and " Guardians," and may be referred to as contain:
ing a vast body of matter on subjects of high interest, written
with all the author's characteristic spirit and vigour.

1 The Tories vainly endeavoured to buy up De Foe: but
Newgate had no terrors for him, and he continued at once
their prisoner and their assailant. Upon the accession of
Mr. Harley to office, his own politics not being dissimilar to
those of De Foe, the minister made a private communication' ,

to our author, with the view of obtaining his support. No '_
xx, .
immediate arrangement, however, took place between them,
as De Foe remained a prisoner some months afterwards.
Notwithstanding, it is most likely that the Queen became ac-
quainted with De Fee's real merits through the medium of
the minister, and was made conscious of the injustice of our
author's sufferings, which she now appeared desirous to miti-
gate. For this purpose, she sent money to his wife and
family, at the same time transmitting to him a sufficient sum
for the payment of his fine, and the expenses attending his
discharge from prison.

On his release from prison, De Foe retired to Bury St. Ed-
munds. Party clamour, and party malice, however, pursued
him there. On the miserable libels issued at this time against
him, he says, "I tried retirement, and banished myself from
the town. I thought, as the boys used to say, 'twas but fair
they should let me alone, while I did not meddle with them.
But neither a country recess, any more than a stone doublet,
can secure a' man from the clamour of the pen." In his elegy
on the author of "The True-born Englishman," he alludes
to the report that the Tories had exerted themselves in his
favour. He says, in answer :--

" So I, by Whigs abandoned, beer
The Saytr's unjust lash ;
Dye with the scandal of their help,
But never saw their cash."

XXI].
It appears that in 1705 De Foe was employed by Harley
to execute some mission of a secret nature, which required
his presence upon the continent. The mission, whatever it
was, appears to have been attended with some danger, and
to have required his absence for about two months. Harley.
seems to have been so well satisfied, that upon De Fee's re-
turn, he was rewarded with an appointment at home. In
1706, De Foe wrote voluminously on the subjects of the union
with Scotland, which measure he advocated with all the
strength of his powers. This advocacy obtained for him a
confidential mission to Scotland, where he was received with
great consideration. While in Edinburgh, he published his
"Caledonia," &c., a poem in honour of Scotland and the
Scots nation. Of the union, he says, in his "Review," "I
have told Scotland of improvement in trade, wealth, and"
shipping, that shall accrue to them on the happy conclusion
of this afi'air; and I am pleased doubly with this, that I ant
likely to be one of the first men that shall give them the
pleasure of the experiment." In 1708, De Foe was rewarded
with an appointment and a fixed salary. When the union
was completed, he published "The Union of Great Britain."
In 1710, De Foe resided at Stoke-Newington, and appears to
have been comfortable in his circumstances. In 1712 was
closed the last volume of the "Review." In along preface
to this 'volume, De Foe has a most eloquent defence of this

work, and of the mode in which he had conducted it. '
Nothing can be finer, more manly, or more conclusive. In
allusion to his sufferings during the progress of the work, he
says, "I have gone through a life of wonders, and am the
subject of a vast variety of providences; I have been fed
more by miracle than Elijah when the ravens were his pur-

veyors. I have some time ago summed up my life in this
distich :--

" No man has tasted differing fortunes more,
And thirteen times I have been rich and poor.

In the school of afiiiction, I have learnt more than at the
academy, and more divinity than from the pulpit; in prison,
I have learnt to know that liberty doesnot consist in open doors,
and the free egress and regress of locomotion. I have seen
the rough side of the world as well as the smooth, and have,
in less than half a year, tasted the difi'erence between the
closet of a king and the dungeon of Newgate." This preface
may be considered as a review--a summing up of the events
of De Foc's political life, and, as such, is of the highest value
for the noble spirit of conscious truth breathing in and ani-
mating every line of it. As a piece of English, it is exquisite
for its innate strength--the beauty of its simplicity. De Foe,
however, was again doomed to taste the dungeon sweets of
.Newgate, being committed there upon the foolish charge of
writing libels in favour of tho Pretender."

After the death of Queen Anne, De Foe, who had been a

XXIV
political writer for thirty years, retired from the thorny field
to the more pleasant paths of instructive fiction. Whilst
writing "An Appeal to Honour and Justice," he was struck
with apoplexy; be, however, recovered,-and, in the early
,' part of 1715, committed to the press one of his most valuable
treatises, " The Family Instructor." In 1719 appeared the
immortal "Robinson Crusoe 1" Nearly the whole circle of
booksellers had in vain been canvassed for a publisher. Wil-
liam Taylor, the fortunate speculator, is said to have cleared
a thousand pounds by the work, which rose into immediate
popularity, despite of the rancorous assaults of the petty,
vulgar minds abounding amongst De Fee's political enemies.
There can be no doubt that the idea of the work was first
suggested to De Foe by the story of Alexander Selkirk, which
had been given to the public seven years before. The ene
mies of De Foe charged him with having obtained this man's
journal, and, from its contents, producing "Robinson Crusoe."
The truth is, De Foe was as much indebted to Selkirk for
the materials used in his immortal work, as was Vandyke forE .~
, his portraits to the colourman who furnished him with pig-r -'
ments. In a number of "The Englishman," Sir Richard

Steele gave the true and particular history of Selkirk. The"

; place in which "Robinson Crusoe" was composed has been-

variously contested. It seems most probable (says Mr. Wil- _
' son) that De Foe wrote it in his retirement in Stoke-Newingi

ton, where he resided, during the principal part of Queen-

XXV
Anne's reign, in a large white house, rebuilt by himself, and
still standing in Church street. The work has been printed
in almost every written language--has been the delight of
men of all creeds and all distinctions--from the London ap-
prentice in his garret, to the Arab in his tent.

"Robinson Crusoe" was speedily followed by the "Account
of Dickory Crooke," the "Life and Piracies of Captain Single-
ton," the "History of Duncan Campbell," the "Fortunes and
Misfortunes of Moll Flanders," the "Life of Colonel J acque,"
the " Memoirs of a Cavalier," and that extraordinary work,
the "Account of the Plague." We might possibly have laid
before the reader a correct list of the multifarious productions
of our author, many of them, until of late, most difficult to
be obtained, had not the spirit of the times called for complete
editions of De Fee's works, most welcome and valuable offer-
ings to the reading part of the nation.

The latter years of De Fee's life must have been those of
competence--a most honourable competence--insured to him
by his works, and the rapidity with which editions followed
editions. There is, however, a too miserable proof of his
sufi'erings, inflicted upon him by the cruelty and undutiful-
ness of his son, who, to quote a letter of De Foe, written in
his anguish, "has both ruined my family and broken my
heart." De Foe adds,---- ." I depended upon him, I trusted
him, I gave up my two dear unprovided children into his

hands; but he has no compassion, and suffers them and their

poor dying mother to beg their bread at his door, and to
crave, as if it were an aims, what he is bound, under hand
and seal, besides the most sacred promises, to supply them
with; himself, at the same time, living in a profusion of
plenty. It is too much for me."

" For some years before his death, De Foe was tormented
with those dreadful maladies, the gout and the stone, occa-
sioned, in part, most probably, by his close application to
study, whilst making posterity the heirs of undying wisdom.
De Foe expired on the 24th of April, 1731, when he was
about seventy years of age, having been born in the year
1661. The parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, in which he
drew his first breath, was also destined to receive his last. He
was buried from thence, on the 26th of April, in Tindall's
burial-ground, now most known by the name of Bunhill
Fields. His wife died at the latter end of the following year.
De Foe left six children, two sons and four daughters, whose _
descendants are living at the present time.

The character of De Foe was but the practical example of
his noblest writings. As a citizen of the world, his love of
truth, and the patience, the cheerfulness, with which he ens,
(lured the obloquy and persecution of his enemies, endear bid:
to us as a great working benefactor to his race. His memory.
is enshrined with the memories of those who make steadfast
our faith in the nobility and goodness of human nature. As

it writer, De Foe has bequeathed to us imperishable stores of
xxvii
the highest aml the most useful wisdom. If he paint vice, it
is to show its hiileonsness; whilst virtue itself receives a no
attraction at his hands. His poetry is chiefly distinguished
for its fine common sense; it has no flights--it never wrapl
us by its imagination, but convinces us by its terseness; by
the irresistible eloquence of its truth. Dc Fee's prose, though
occasionally careless, is I'en'iarlcahle for its sin'lplicity and
strength. What he has to say, he. says in the shortest man-
ner, and in the simplest style. He does not--the vice of our
day--hide his thoughts under a glittering mass of words, but
uses words as the pictures of things. It is owing to this
happy faculty, this unforced power, that De Foe occasionally
rises, as in many instances in the golden volume now offered
to the reader, almost to the sublime. In his picture of the
despair of Crusoe, we have, in words intelligible even to in-
flate-y, a wondrous delineation of the soul of man in a most
trying and most erri'ole hour. Dc Foe is, in the most em.
phatic sense. of the word, an lilnglish writer. Cobbett has
been compared to him; and in many of the minor parts of
authorship there is, certainly, a sirnilitude; but Cobbett was
singularly deficient of imagination, the power which gave a.
Colour and a. beauty to all that Do Foe touched, even though
of the homeliest and most- unpromising materials.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

'WAS born at York, in the year 1632, of
a reputable family. My father was a. na-
': ,3) five of Bremen, who, by n'ierchandising at
XV Hull for some time, gained a. very plentiful
"4'9" fortune. He married my mother at York,
and as her maiden name vas Robinson, Iwas called Robin-

son 113'emfznae-r; which not being easily pronounced. in
A" 1 ' .
it the English tongue, we are commonly known by the name
of Crusoe.
~I was the youngest of three brothers. No charge or
pains were wanting in my education. My father designed
me for the law, yet nothing would serve me but I must go
to sea, both against the will of my father, the tears of my
mother, and the entreaties of friends. One morning my
father expostulated very warmly with me: " What reason,"
says he, " have you to leave your native country, and enter
into a wandering condition of uneasiness and uncertainty 2"
He recommended to me Agar's wish, "Neither to desire
poverty nor riches ;" told me that a middle state of life
was the most happy, and that high, towering thoughts of
raising our condition by wandering abroad, often ended in
confusion and disappointment. " I entreat you, nay, I com-
mand you," says he, "to desist from these intentions. If
you will go," added he, "my prayers shall be offered for
your preservation, but a time may come, when desolate,
oppressed, or forsaken, you may wish you had taken your
poor father's counsel." IIe pronounced these words with-ii?
such a moving and paternal eloquence, while floods of
tears ran down his aged cheeks, that it seemed to shake my
resolutions. But this soon wore off, and a little after 1
informed my mother, that I could not settle to any business;

and begged she would gain my father's consent only to go
2 , .
one voyage; which if it did not prove prosperous, I would-
never attempt a second. My mother warmly expressed her
dislike of this proposal.

I was then, I think, nineteen years old, when one time
being at Hull, I met a school-fellow going with his father,
who was master of a. ship, to London; and acquainting him
with my wandering desires, he assured me of a free passage,

and a plentiful share of What was necessary. Thus, without
imploring a blessing, or taking farewell of my parents, I _ 5
took shipping on the let of September, 1651. '

After various adventures we made the Bra'zils, where
having diSpatched some necessary business, we sailed north-
ward upon'the coast, in order to gain Africa, till we made
Cape Augustine; fr om whence going further into the ocean,
out of sight of land, We steered as though we were bound

'for the Isle Fernand de Norenba, leaving the islands on the

' east, ' and then it was that we met with a terrible tempest,
which continued twelve days, the winds carrying us Wher-
ever they pleased. In this perplexity one of our men died,
and. another and a boy were washed overboard. When the
weather cleared up a little, we found ourselves in eleven
degrees north latitude, upon the coast of Guinea. Upon

' this the captain gave reasons for returning, which I opposed,
counselling him to stand away for Barbadoes, which, as I
supposed, might be attained in fifteen days, So, altering

For the joys of heaven and the torments of hell seemed to
present themselves before me in these dying agonies. I
was going, I thought, I knew not whither, into a dismal
gulf unknown, never to behold my friends, nor the light of
this world any more! I strove, however, to the last ex-

m CREW LEAVING THE SHIP.
1' tremity, While all my companions were overpowered and
entombed in the deep; and it was with great difficulty I
kept my breath till the wave spent itself, and, retiring
back, left me on the shore half dead. As soon as I got on
5

i:
'.
my feet, I ran as fast as I could, lest another wave should
pursue me, and carry me back again. The sea came after
me like a. high mountain, or furious enemy. The next
dreadful wave buried me at once twenty or thirty feet deep,
but at the same time carried me With_a mighty force and
sWii'tness towards the shore; when raising myself, I held
out till the water, having spent itself, began to return, at
which I struck forward, and feeling ground with my feet, I
took to my heels again. I was at length dashed against a
piece of rock, in such a manner as left me senseless; but
recovering a little before the return of the wave, which, no
doubt, would have overwhelmed me, I pushed hastily for-
ward and reached the mainland ; when clambering up the
cliffs of the shore, tired and almost spent, I sat down on the
grass, free from the dangers of the foaming ocean.

'_ No tongue can express the eestacies and transports that
my soul felt at the happy deliverance. I was wrapt in
contemplation, and often lifted up my hands, with the pro.
foundest humility, to the Divine power, for saving my life.
when all the rest of my companions were drowned. 1
cast my eyes around, to behold What place I was in, and
what I had next to do. I could see no house nor people;
I was Wet, yet had no clothes ; hungry and thirsty, yet had
nothing to eat or drink; no weapon to destroy any creature

for my sustenance, nor defend myself against devoul'ing__
6
beasts; in short, I had nothing but a knife, a tobacco pipe,"
and a box half filled with tobacco. The darksome night.
coming upon me, increased my fears of being devoured by
wild creatures; my mind was plunged in despair, and
having no prospect, as I thought, of life before me, I pre-
pared for another kind of death than. what I had lately
escaped. I walked about a furlong to see if I could find
any fresh water, which I did to my great joy; and taking
a quid of tobacco to prevent hunger, I got up into a thick
bushy tree, and seating myself so that I could not fall, a
deep sleep overtook me, and for that night buried my sor-
rows in quiet repose.

It was broad day the next morning before I awaited;
when I not only perceived the tempest had ceased, but saw
the ship driven almost as far as the rock which the waves
had dashed me against, and which was about a miie from.
the place where I was. When 1 came down from my
apartment in the tree, I perceived the ship's boat two miles
di staut on my right hand, lying on shore as the waves had '
cast her. I thought to have got to her, but there being uni:
inlet of water oi about half a mile 8 breadth between it and
me, I returned again towards the ship, as hoping tongs"
something for my immediate subsistence. About noon
when the sea. was calm, resolving to get to the shipa

stripped and leaped into the water , it was my good fem
7 .. .
to espy a. small piece of rope hanging so low, that by the
help of it, though with great difficulty, I got into the ship.
The provisions I found in good order, with which I crammed

l my pockets, and, losing no time, ate while I was doing
'other things. I also found some rum, of which I took a.
hearty dram ; and now I wanted for nothing except a boat
to carry away what was needful for me. i

Necessity quickens invention. We had several spare
yards, a spare topmast or two, and two or three large spans
of wood. With these I fell to work, and flung as many of
them overboard as I could manage, tying every one of
them with a rope, that they might not drive away. This
done, I went down to the ship's side, and tied four of them
fast together at both ends, in form of a raft, and laying two
or three short pieces of plank upon them crosSways, I found
it would bear me, but not any considerable weight.- Upon
which I Went to work again, cutting a spare topmast into
three lengths, adding them to my raft with a great deal of
. labor and pains. I then considered what I should load it .
with, it being not able to bear a ponderous burden. And .-
this I soon thought of, first laying upon it all the planks"
and boards I could get; next I lowered down three of the '
se.11ne11's chests, after I had filled them with bread, rice,';,
three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and:
some Em openn corn; and for liquors I found several caseg
of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were 30m}?
cordial waters, and four or five gallons of 1ack, which
stow ed by themselves. By this time the tide beginni '
flow, I perceived my coat, waistcoat, and shirt swim awa
which I left on the shore; as for my linen breeches an
stockings, I swam with them to the ship, but I soon found

clothes enough, though I took no m01e than I wanted foE
B 9 '
the present. My eyes were chiefly on tools to work with ;
and, after a. long search, I found out the carpenter's chest,
which I got safe down on my raft. I then looked for arms
and ammunition, and in the great cabin found two good

- fowling--pieces, .two pistols, several powder-horns filled, a

small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I likewise
found three barrels of powder, two of which were good;
also two or three broken oars, two saws, an axe and a ham-
mer. I then put to sea, and in getting to shore had three
cncouragements. 1. A smooth, calm sea. 2. The tide
rising and setting in to shore. 3. The little Wind there was
blew towards the land. After I had sailed about a mile,

. I found the raft drive a little distance from the place where

I first landed; and then I perceived a little opening of the
land, with a strong current of the tide running into it: upon
which I kept the middle of the stream. But great was my
concern, when on a sudden the fore part of my raft ran
aground,<<so that had I not, with great difficulty, for near
half an hour, kept my back straining against the chests to
keep my effects in their places, all I had would have gone
in the sea. But after some time, the rising of the water
caused the raft to float again, and coming up a little river
with land on both sides, I landed in a cave, as near the
mouth as possible, the better to discover a sail, if any provv

identially passed that way.

""Not far off I espied a hill of stupendousheight, 8111111:
rounded with lesser hills, and thither I was resolved to gas"
and view the country, that I might see what pa1t was best
to fix- my habitation Accordingly, 111 1111110 myself with i}
pistol, a lh-oxxling piece, powder and ball, IL"I ascended the
mountain. Thele I perceived I was in an island, encom-
passed by the sea, no distant lands to be seen, but scattering '
rocks that lay to the west: it seemed to be a ba1ren place,
inhabited only by wild beasts. I perceived abundance of.
fowls, but ignorant of what kind, or whether: good for mom'-
islnnent, ' I shot one of them at my return, which occasioned :
a confused screaming among the other birds, and Iionnd' "
it, by its color and beak, to be a kind of hawk, but its fleslr ,
was perfect carrion.

When I came to my raft, I brought my effects on shore;
and fearing that some cruel beasts might devour me in the '
night-time, I made a kind of but or barricade with the '.
chests and boa1ds. I slept very comfortably, and the next '-'
morning got on board as before, and _:p1epared a second?
1111ft, fa1 nicer than the first, upon which I brought array.
the carpenter's stores, two or three bags full of nails, 11. guest

j11ck- -8018W, a dozen or two of hatchets, and a gmndstorre;
two or three i1on crows, two barrels of musketbulle'te,7
another fowling-- piece, a small quantity of powder, 1111C/_.1g.i

lalge bag full of small shot. Besides these, I took all M
11 -
men's clothes I could find, a spare foretop-sail, a hammock,
and some bedding; and thus completing my second cargo,
I made all the haste to shore I could, fearing some wild
beast might destroy what I had there already. But I only
found a little wild--cat, sitting on one of the chests, which,
seeming not to fear me, or the gun that I presented at her,
I threw her a piece of biscuit, which she instantly ate and
departed.

When I had got these effects on shore, I went to work,
in order to make me a little tent with the sail and some
poles which I had cut for that purpose; and having finished
it, what things might be damaged by the weather I brought
in, piling all the empty chests and casks in a circle, the
better to fortifi>>r it against any sudden attempt of man or
beast. After this I blocked up the doors with some boards,
charged my gun and pistol, and laying my bed on the
ground, slept comfortably till next morning.

Now, though I had enough to subsist me a long time,
yet despairing of a sudden deliverance, I coveted as much
as I could; and so long as the ship remained in that condi-

- tion, I daily brought away one necessary or other, particu-
larly the rigging, sails, and cordage, some twine, a barrel of
wet powder, some sugar, 21 barrel of meal, three casks of
rum, and, what indeed was most welcome to me, a whole
hogshead of bread.

times on board, bringing away all that was possible. As I
was going the twelfth time, the Wind began to rise; 110W-

ever, I ventured at low water, and rummaging the cabin,
in a locker I found several razors, scissors, and some dozens
of knives and forks; and in another, thirty-six pounds of

= pieces of eight, silver and gold.
' 13

SS That night I slept very contentedly in my little tent, sur-
rounded With all my effects; but when I looked out in the
morning no more ship was to be seen. My next thoughts
were, how I should secure myself from savages and wild
beasts, if any such were in the island. At one time I
thought of digging a cave; at another, I was for erecting a.
tent; and, at length, I resolved to do both.

I found a little plain near a rising hill, the front towards
which being as steep as a house-side, nothing could descend
on me from the top. On the side of this rock was a little
hollow place, resembling the entrance or door of a. cave.
Just before this place, on the circle of' the green, I resolved
my tent should stand. This plain did not much exceed a
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, like a de-
lightful green before my door, with a. pleasing, though an
irregular descent every way to the low grounds by the sea-
side, lying on the northwest side of the hill, so that it was
sheltered from the excessive heat of the sun. After this I
drew a semicircle, containing ten yards in a semidiameter
and twenty yards in the whole, driving down two rows of
strong stakes, not six inches from each other; then, with a
piece of cable which I had cut on board, I regularly laid
them in a circle between the piles up to their tops, which
were more than five feet out of the earth, and after drove

' :u'inother row of piles, looking within-side against them, be-
14
tween two and three feet high, which made me conclude-it's '
a little impregnable castle against men and beasts. And
for my, better security I would have no door, but entered in .
and came out by the help of a ladder which I also made.
Here was my fence and fortress, into which I carried
all my riches, ammunition, and sto1es. After whiohgvsi
wcrking on the iock, with what dirt and stones I dfig'
out, I not only raised my ground two feet, but made a-
little cellar to my mansion- house, and this cost me many.
days' labor and pains. One day in particular, a shower of
rain falling, thunder and lightning ensued, which put me.'
in terror lest my powde1 should take fire. To plevent '
which, I fell to making boxes and bags, 'in order to separa- .
ate it, having by me near 150 lbs. weight. And thus being '
established as king of the island, every day I went out With '-
my gun to see what I could kill that was fit to eat. ' I soon :
perceived numbers of goats, and shot one. suckling, a-youn
kid; which, not thinking its dam slain, stood by her uncono.
cerned; and when I took the dead creature up, the yous"
one followed me even to the inclosure I lifted the kid
over the pales, and would willingly have kept it alive; but
finding it would not eat, I killed that also.
It was, by the account I kept, the 30th of Septemheg
when I first landed on this island. About twelve (hiya

after, fearing lest I should lose my reckoning of timc,n
15
even forget the Sabbath days, for want of pen, ink, and
paper, I carved with a knife upon a large post, in great let--_
ters, these words, "I came on shore, Sept. 30, 1659."
Every day I cut a notch with my knife on the sides of this
square post,'and that on the Sabbath was as long again as
the rest; and every first day of the month as long again as

that long one. Had I made a more strict search I need

not; have set up this mark; for, among my parcels, I found
the very things I wanted, particularly pens, ink, and paper;
also two or three compasses, some mathematical instru-
ments, dials, perspectireoglasses, books of navigation, three
English Bibles, and several other good books, which I care-
fully put- up. A dog and two cats on board. I made. inhabit-
ants with me in my castle. Though one might think I had
all the necessaries that were desirable, yet still I found sev-
eral things wanting. My ink was daily wasting; I wanted
needles, pins, and thread, to mend my clothes, and particu-
larly a spade, pickaxe, or shovel, to remove the earth. It
was a year before I finished my little bulwark.

Having raised a turf wall against the outside of my huh-
itation, I thatched it so close as might keep it from the in.
clemency of the weather. I also improved it within, eu- '

_ larged my cave, and made a passage and door in the rock,

which came out beyond the pale of my fortification. I next

proceeded to make a chair and a table. When I wanted a
16
plan]: or board, I hewed down a tree with my hatchet,

making it as thin with my axe as possible, and then smooth
enough with an adze to answer my designs; thus in time I
got boards enough to shelter all my stores.

' 'But now a very strange event happened: for one day
finding a bag, which used to hold corn for the fowls-, I re-

\ solved to put gunpowder in it, and shook all the husks and
- fdlrt upon one side of the rock, little expecting what the
-:'cons'equence would be. The rain had fallen plentifully a.

17
few days before, and about a month after, to my great
amazement, something began to look very green and flour-
ishing; and when I came to View it more nicely every day
as it grew, I found about ten or twelve ears of green barley
appearing in the very same shape and make as that in
England.

yI can scarce express the agitations of my mind at this
sight. Hitherto I had looked upon the actions of this life
only as the events of blind chance. But now the appear-
ance of this barley, flourishing in a barren soil, and my ig-
norance in not conceiving how it should come there, made
me conclude that miracles were not yet ceased; nay, I even
thought that God had appointed it to grow there without
any seed, purely for my sustenance in this miserable and
desolate island. And, indeed, such great effect this had
upon me, that it often made me melt into tears, through a
grateful sense of God's mercies; and the greater still was

2.: my thankfulness, when I perceived about this little field of

' barley some rice-stalks, also, wonderfully flourishing.
While thus pleased in mind, 1 concluded them must be
more com in the island, and theretore made a. diligent
search among the looks; but not being able to find any, on
a sudden it came into my mind how I had shaken the
husks of corn out of the bag, and then my admiration

ceased, with my gratitude to the Divine Being, as thinking
' 18
it was but natural, and not to be conceived a miracle;

, though even the manner of its preservation might have
made me own it was a wonderful event of God's kind
providence.

It was about the latter end of J nne when the ears of this
"corn ripened, which I laid up very carefully, together with
twenty or thirty stalks of rice, expecting one day I should
reap the fruit of my labor; yet fOur years were expired
before I could allow myself to eat any barley--bread, and
much longer time before I had any rice. After this, with .
indefatigable pains and industry, for three or four months,"
at last I finished my wall on the 14th of April, having no
way to go into it, but by a ladder against the wall. April
17th I finished my ladder and ascended it; afterwards
pulled it up, then let it down on the other side, and de-
scendeddnto my new habitatitm, where I had space enough,
and se fortified that nothing could attack me without scaling
the walls.

It was not long after that, when a horrible tempest arose,
at the same time attended with a hurricane of wind. It
continued raining all that night, and some time the next

.day. As soon as the weather cleared up I resolved to
build me a. little but in some open place, walled round to
defend me from wild creatures and savages.

When I began to put my resolutions in practice, I was
" 19
stopped for want of tools and instruments to work with.
Most. of my axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned. by
cutting the hard timber that grew on the island. It took
3, me full 9. week to make my grindstone of use.

was torn ofi', and washed 3 great distance ashore; but the";
rest lay 111 the sands. '
At this time I was afflicted with an ague; thirsty, yet-E
could not help myself to watel , p1ayed to God in these 34
words: "Lord, in pity look upon me: Lord, have mercy,"
upon me; have me1 (.37 upon me!" Aftel this I fell asleep;
and d1eamed. When I got up, my spirits were lively and}
cheeiful; I was very hungry , and, in short, no fit returnedfi
the next day, but I found myself much altered for _th6,,1
better. '3
I had now been about ten months' 1n the island, and, as a
never had seen any of the human kind, I accounted mysg'
as sole mona1ch, and, as I g1ew better, having secured
habitation to my mind, I resolved to make a tour round my_;
kingdom, 1n 01 der to make new discove1ies.-.1'
The 15th of July I began my journey; I first went to the
czeek, where I had brought my rafts on shore, and travel-i 1
ling further, found that the tide went no higher than two;
miles up, Where there was a little brook of running watergzij
on the banks of which were many pleasant savannahs, or}:
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the-'1:
rising parts,bwhe1e I supposed the water did not reaohgili

  
  

  

 
 

 

which I did not understand. I searched a long time 111;
L15
the cassava-root, which I knew the Indians of that climate
made their bread ot', but. all in vain. There were several
plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what they
were; I saw also several sugar-canes, but imperfect for
want of cultivation. \Vith these few discoveries, I came
back that night, and slept contentedly in my little castle.
The next day, going the same way, but further than the
day before, I found the country more adorned with woods
and trees. Here I perceived difl'erent fruits in great abun-
dance. Melons in plenty lay on the ground, and clusters of
grapes, ripe and very rich, spread over the trees. You
may imagine I was glad of the discover ', yet ate very
sparingly. The grapes I found of excellent use, for when I
had dried them in the sun, which preserved them as dried
raisins are kept, they proved very wholesome and nourish-
ing, and served me in those seasons when no grapes were
to be had. The night drawing on apace, I ascended a tree,
and slept ver ' eomtbrtahly, though it was the first time I
had lain out of my habitation. And when the morning
came, I proceeded with great pleasure on my way, travel-
ling about four miles, as I imagined, by the length of the
valley, directing my course northward. At the end of the
valley, I came to an opening, where the country seemed to
descend to the West; there I found a little spring of fresh
water proceeding out of the side of the hill, with its crystal
22
streams running directly east. And, indeed, here my senses
were charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature
could afl'ord; for the country appeared flourishing, green,
and delightful. I then descended on the side of that
delicious vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange,
lemon, and citron trees, but very wild and barren at that
time. The limes were delightful and Wholesome, and the

'uice mixed in water was ve r coolin and refreshin . I-
a 3 r) g

resolved to carry home a store of grapes, limes, and lemons,
against the approaching wet season; and returned to my
little castle, after having spent three days in this journey.

And now, contemplating the fruitfuluess of this vallefiits
security from storms, and the delightfulness of the adjacent
woods, I resolved to make a little kind of bower, surround-
ing it with a double hedge, as high as I could reach, well
staked and filled with bulrushes, and having spent a great
part of the month of J uly, I think it was the first of August
before I began to enjoy my labor.

On the 30th September, casting up the notches on my

post, which amounted to 365, I concluded this to be the

anniversary of my landing; and, therefore, humbly pros;
trating myself on the ground, confessing my sins, acknow-

ledging'God's righteous judgments upon me, and praying to.

Jesus Christ to have mercy upon me, I fasted for twelve

hours till the going down of the sun, and then, eating a
23

. _' .u-t'.
biscuit and a bunch of grapes laid me on the bed, and with
great comfort took my night's repose.

I now resumed my intention of exploring the island;
taking my dOO', gun, hatchet, two biscuit-cakes, a great
bunch of raisins, with a larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual, I began my journey. Having passed the vale
where my bower stood, I came within View of the sea, lying
to the west; when, it being a clear day, I deseried land,
extending from the IV. to the S. W. about ten or fifteen
leagues, but could not say whether it was an island or con-
tinent.

As I proceeded forward, I found this side of the island
much more pleasant than mine; the fields fragrant, adorned
with sweet flowers and verdant grass, tOgether with several
very fine woods. There were parrots in plenty, which
made me long for one to be my companion, but it His with
great difficulty I could knock one down; and I kept him .
some yeels before I could get him to call me by my name.

I continued my journey, travelling about twelve miles
further towards the east, where 1 set a. great pile on the
shore for a mark. in this journey my dog surprised a kid,
and would have killed it, had I not prevented him. As 1
had often been thinking of getting a kid or two, and so
raising a breed of tame goats to supply me after my annnu-
nition was spent, I took this opportunity of beginning, and

2-4
having made a collar for this little creature, with a string
of rope-yarn, I brought it to my bower, and there inclosed
and left him; and having spent a. month in this journey, at
length I returned to my own habitation, and rested myself

 

ROBINSON OATOEIS A mm

a week, which time I employed in making a cage for my
_prett-y Poll I now recollected my poor kid I had left in
the hower, and immediately went to fetch it home. When
I Came there, I found it almost starved: I gave it soifie

food: and it followed me like a. dog; and as I constantly
n 25
fed it, it became so loving, gentle, and fond, that it would
never leave me.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox being now
come, I kept the 30th of September in the most solemn
manner, as usual, it being the third year of my abode in the
island. I spent the whole day in acknowledging God's
mercies, in giving him thanks for making this solitary life
as agreeable and less sinful than that of human society,
and for the communications of his grace to my soul, in sup-
porting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend upon
his providence, and hope for his eternal presence in the
world to come.

My corn having ripened apace, the latter end of Decem-
ber, which was my second harvest, I reaped it with a scythe
made of one of my broadswords. I had no fatigue in out
ting down my first crop, it was so slender. The ears I car-
ried home in a basket, rubbing it with my hands, instead of
threshing it; and when the harvest was over, found my
half peck of seed produced near two bushels of rice, and
two bushels and a half of barley. I knew not how to grind
my corn, neither how to bake the bread.

The want of a plough to turn up the earth, or shovel to '
dig it, I conquered by making a wooden spade. The want
of a barrow I supplied by dragging over the com a great

bough of a tree. When it was growing I was forced to
2K
fence it; when ripe, to mow it, carry it home, thresh it, and
part it from the chaff. And after all I wanted a mill to
grind it, sieve to dress it, yeast and salt to make it into
bread, and an oven to bake it. This set my brains to work
to find some expedient for every one of these necessaries
against the next harvest. '
And now having more seed, my first care was to prepare
more land. I pitched upon two large flat pieces of ground, .
near my castle, for that purpose, in which I sowed my seed, '
and fenced it with a good hedge. This took me up three. 5
months; by which time the wet season coming 'on, and the
rain keeping me within doors, I found several occasions to
employ myself, and, while at work, used to divert myself in - '1
talking to my parrot, learning him to know and speak his
own name, Poll, the first welcome word I ever heard
spoken in the island. I had been along time contriving
how to make earthen vessels, which I wanted extremely,
when it happened, that as I was putting out my fire, I found
therein a broken piece of one of my vessels burnt as hard as '
a rock, and red as a tile. This made me think of burning
some pots, and having no notion of a kiln, or of glazing
them with lead, I fixed th1ee large pipkins, and two or three _
pots 1n a pile one upon another. The fire I piled round the I

  
 
 
 

} outside, and dry wood upon the top, til] I saw the pots 13-.
c the inside red- hot, and found that they were not crack"
' 27
all ; and when I perceived them perfectly red, I let one of
them stand in the fire about five or six hours, till the clay
melted by the extremity of the heat, and would have run
to glass had I suffered it, upon which I slackened my fire
by degrees, till the redness abated, and watching them till
morning, I found I had three very good pipkins, and two
earthen pots, as well burnt as I could desire.

N 0 joy could be greater than mine at this discovery. I

. filled one of my pipkins with water to boil me some meat.

The next concern I had, was to get me a. stone mortar to
beat some corn in, instead of a mill to grind it. But all the
stones of the island being of a monldering nature, I resolved
to look out for a great block of hard wood, which having
found, I formed it with my axe and hammer, and then, with
infinite labor, made a. hollow in it, just as the Indians of
Brazil make their canoes. When I had finished this, I
made a great pestle of iron-wood, and then laid them up
against my succeeding harvest.

My next business was to make a sieve to sift my meal,
and part it from the bran and husk. Having no fine, thin
canvas, I could not tell what to do. "That linen I had was
reduced to rags. At length I remembered I had some
neckcloths of calico or muslin, of the sailors, which I had
brought out of the ship, and with these I made three small

sieves, proper enough for the work.
28
The want of an oven I supplied by making some earthen
pans, very b1oad but not deep. When I had a mind 1:0
bake, I made a g1eat fire upon the heaith, the tiles of which
I had made myself; and when the wood was burnt into
live coals, I spread them over it, till it became very hot;
then sweeping them away, I set down my loaves, and turn-
ing down the earthen pots upon them, drew the ashes and
coals all round the outsides of the pots, to continue the
heat, and in this manner I baked my barley leaves as well
as if I had been a complete pastry-cook, and also made of
the rice several cakes and puddings. _ .

These things took me up the best part of a year, and what i
intermediate time I had was bestowed in managing my new - Q
harvest and husbandry, for in the proper s'eason I reaped
my corn, carried it home and laid it up in the ear in my
large baskets, till I had time to rub, instead of threshing it.

All this while, the prospect of land, which I had seen
from the other side of the island, ran in my mind. I still
meditated a. deliverance f1om this place, and I began to
think whether it was not possible for me to make a. canoe,.
such as the Indians make of the trunk of a tree. But hence}.
I lay under particular inconveniences: want of tools to- _
make it, and want of hands to move itin the water when it
was made. However, to work I went,---I first cut down a

cedar-tree, which was five feet ten inches diameter at the
29 --
lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches
diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it lessened
for a space, and then parted into branches. Twenty days
was I a hacking and hewing this tree at the bottom, four-
teen more in cutting off the branches and limbs, and a
Whole month in shaping it like the bottom of a. boat. As
for the inside, I was three weeks with a mallet and chisel
clearing it, till it was big enough to carry twenty-six men,
much bigger than any canoe I ever saw in my life, and con-
sequently sufficient to transport me and all my effects to
that wished-for shore.

Nothing remained now, but to get it into the water, it
lying about one hundred yards from it. I proceeded to
measure the distance of ground, resolving to make a canal
in order to bring the water to the canoe, since I could not-
hring the canoe to the water. But as this seemed to be im-
practicable, under the space of eleven or twelve years, I
concluded the attempt altogether vain. I now saw what
stupidity it is to begin work before we reckon on its cost, or
judge rightly our own abilities to go through with its per-
formance.

In the height of this work my fourth year expired, from
the time I was cast on this island. At this time I did not
forget my anniversary, but kept it with rather greater devo-

tion than before. For now my hopes being fi'ustrated, I
' 80
looked upon this world as a thing I had nothing to do with,
and well might I say, as father Abraham said unto Dives,
" Between thee and me there is a gulf fixed." I was sepa-
rated from its wickedness too, having neither the lust of
the flesh, the lust of the eye, nor the pride of life; I had
nothing to covet, being lord, king, and emperor over the
whole country, without dispute and without control. Corn,
plenty of turtles, timber in abundance, and grapes above
measure. What was all the rest to me? The money I had
lay by me as despicable dross, which I would freely havd:
given fo1 a gross of tobacco-pipes, or a hand- mill to grind:
my com; in a word, the nature and experience of these
things dictated to me this just reflection: That the good
things of this world are no further good to us, than they are
for our use; and that whatsoever we may heap up to give
to others, we can but enjoy as. much as we use.

These thoughts rendered my mind more easy than usua /
Every time I sat down to meat, I did it with thankfuln --
admiring the providential hand of God, who, in this wilder-
ness, had spread a table for me. "

As long as my ink continued, which, with water, I made
last as long as I could, I used to minute down the days of
the month on which any remarkable event happened.

The next thing that wasted afte1 my ink, was the biscuits

which Ihad brought out of the ship, and though I allowed
31
myse'if but one cake a day for above a txx'cfi'iemmnh, yet I
was quite out of bread for near a year, befiu'c I gut any

com of my mm.

of the sun would not suffer me to hear any of the seamen's
heavy watch-coats, which made me turn tailor, and after. 5:
mise1 able botching manner, conve1ted then into jackets.
To preserve my head, I made a cap of goat's skin, with the '

haii ontwmds, to keep out the rain, and afte1 wards, a waist-

coat and open-knead breeches of the same. I contrived a
sort of umbrella, covering it with skins, which not only if:
kept out the heat of the sun, but rain also. Thus being ,
easy and settled in my mind, my chief happiness was to '.
conveise with God, in p1 ayer _ '
F or five yeais afte1 this nothing extraordinary occurred I
to me. Though I was disappointed in my first canoe, I,
made, at intermediate times, a second, of much inferior-"j
size, and it was two years before I had finished it. But as
I perceived it would no wise answer my design of sailing .
to the other shore, my thoughts were confined to take a tour: -'
round the island, to see what further discoveries I could __
make. To this intent, after having moved her to the water,
and tried how she would sail, I fitted up a little mast to my;
boat, and made a sail of the ship's sail, that lay by rides. J X
then made lockers or bdxcs at the end of it, to put inn ' '

61y umbrella I fixed in a step in the stern, like a mast, to

keep the heat of the sun ofl' me. And now resolving to see
the circumference of my little kingdom, I victualled my
ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen of my barley-
bread loaves, an earthen pot full of parched rice, 3 little
bottle of rum, half a goat, powder and shot, and two watch-
coats. It was the 6th of November, in the 6th year of my
captivity, that I set out on this voyage, which was much
longer than I expected, being obliged to put farther out on
account of the rocks. After a while, however, I brought
my boat safe to a little cove, and laid down to take a wel-
come repose. When I awoke, I considered how I might
get my boat home, and coasting along the shore, I came to
a good bay which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where,
finding a good harbor, I stowed her as safe as if she had
been in a dry dock made on purpose for her.

One time I made a journey through the island, and
in the evening coming to my bower, I laid me down to rest.
I had not slept long before I was awakened in great sur-
prise, by a strange voice that called me several times,
'Robin, Robin, Robinson Crusoe, poor Robin! Where
are you, Robinson Crusoe? Where are you? Where
have you been ?"

So fast was I asleep at first, that I did not awake

thoroughly; but half asleep and half awake, I thought}!
. 84-
dreamed that soniebody'spoke to me. But as the voice
repeated Robinson Crusoe several times, being terribly
affrighted, I started up ; and no sooner were my eyes fully
Open, but I beheld my pretty Poll sitting on the top of the
hedge, and soon knew that it was he that called me, for
'just in" such bewailing language I used to talk and teach
him, which he so exactly learned, that he would sit upon
my finger, and lay his bill close to my face, and cry, " Poor
Robinson Crusoe, where are you? where have you been?
how came you here i" and such like prattle, I had constantly
taught him. But even though I knew it to be the parrot, it
was a great while before I could adjust myself, being
amazed how the creature got thither. But now being
assured it could be no other than my honest Poll, my won-
der ceased, and reaching out. my hand, and calling famil-
iarly, Poll, the creature came to me, and perched upon my
thumb as he was wont, constantly prating to me with
"Poor Robinson Crusoe! and how did I come here, and
where had I been i" as if the bird was overjoyed to see me,
so I took him home with me. .
I now began to lead a very retired life, living near a
twelvemonth in a very contented manner, wanting for
nothing except conversation. '
My powder beginning to fail, I contrived many ways to

ensnare the goats, and see if I could catch them alive, pal>>
'45
tieularly a she-goat with young. At last I had my desire;
for making pitfalls and traps, baited with barley and rice,
I found one morning, in one of them, an old he-goat, and in
the other, three kids, one male, the other two females. It
was some time before they would feed; but throwing them
sweet corn, it so much tempted them that they began to be
tamer. I concluded, that if I designed to furnish myself
with goat's flesh when my ammunition was spent, the tamely
breeding them up like a flock of sheep, about my settlement
was the only method I could take. I resolved to separate
the wild from the tame; and the best way for this was to
have some inclosed piece of ground well fenced, that those
within might not break out, or those without break in.
Such an undertaking was very great for one pair of hands;
but as there We an absolute necessity for it, my first care
was to find a convenient piece of ground where there was
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water to drink, and
shelter to keep them from the sun. I resolved to inclose a
piece of ground about one hundred and fifty yards in length,
and one hundred in breadth, sufficient for as many as would
maintain me till my flock increased, and then I could add
more ground. I now vigorously prosecuted my work, and
it took me about three months to hedge in the first piece.
I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, feeding them

as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and indeed
36"wraps

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

I very often carried some ears of barley, or a handful of
rice, and fed them out of my hand; by which they grew so
tame, that when my inclosure was finished, and I let them
loose, they would run after me for a. handful of corn. In a.
year and a. half '5 time I had 'a flock of about twelve goats,

kids and all; and' in two years after they amounted to

forty-three, besides what I had taken and killed for my sus--

tenance. After which I inclosed five pieces of ground to

feed them in, with pens to drive them into, that I might

take them es I had occasion. 1
a 87
fin this project I likewise found additional blessings; for

I not only had plenty of goat's flesh, but milk too, which at
first I did not think of. And, indeed, though I had never
milked, or seen butter or cheese made, yet, after some
essays and miscarriages, I made both, and never afterwards
wanted.

How merciful can the omnipotent Power comfort his
creatures, even in the midst of their greatest calamities!
He can sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us
reason to magnify him in dungeons and prisons! What a.
bounteous table was here spread in a wilderness for me,
where I expected nothing at first but to perish with hunger!
When I dined, I seemed a king, eating alone, none daring
to presume to do so till I had done. Poll, as if he had
been my principal court favorite, was the only person per-
mitted to talk with me. My old, but faithful dog, contin-
ually sat on my right hand; while my two cats sat on each
side of the table, expecting a bit from my hand, as a mark
of my royal favor. In this manner did I live, wanting for
nothing but conversation. One thing indeed concerned
me, the want of my boat: I knew not which way to get her
round the island. One time I resolved to go along the
shore by land to her; but had any one in England _t
with such a figure, it would either have afii-ighted them, or

made them burst into laughter.

011 each side that it reached to the calves of my legs. As.
for my shoes 31nd stockings, they were made like buskins,
and laced on the sides like spatterdashes, barbarously
shaped like the rest of my habit. I had a broad belt of
goat's skin dried, girt round me with a. couple of thongs in-

ficiency of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet {and saw,

powdel and shot. My basket I carried on my back, 21

 

my gun on my shoulde1, and over my head a. great, clumsiri"
ugly goat's-- -skin 111nb1ella, which, however, next to my gun,
was the most necessary thing about me. As for my face,

  

the color was not quite so swarthy as the Mulattoes, .
might have been expected flom one who took so little est-196,:
of 1t, in a climate within nine or ten degrees of the equator.
At one time my beard grew so long that it hung down
about a quarter of a ya1d; but as I had both razors and

so i
-.'.:..J
scissors in store, I cut it all off, and suffered none to grow,
except a large pair of Mohammedan whiskers, like what I
had seen worn by some Turks at Salee, not long enough,
indeed, to hang a hat upon, but of such a monstrous size as
would have amazed any Englishman.

I had now two plantations in the island; the first, my
little fortification, with many large and spacious improve-
ments. The Piles with which I made my wall were grown
so lofty and great, as secured my habitation. And near
this commodious and pleasant settlement, lay my well-enltL
vated and improved corn-fields, which yielded me their
fruit in proper season. My second plantation was that near
my country-seat or little bower, where my grapes flourished,
and Where, having planted many stakes, I made inclosurcs
for my goats, so strongly fortified by labor and time, that it
was much stronger than a wall, and consequently impossi-
ble for them to break through. As for my bower itself, I
kept it constantly in repair, and cut the trees in such a man-
ner, as made them grow thick and wild, and form a most
delightful shade. In the centre of this stood my tent. I
had driven four piles in the ground, spreading over it a

piece of the ship's sail; beneath which I made a sort of a
' couch with the skins of the creatures I had slain, and other
1things; and having laid thereon one of the sailor's blank-

ets, which I had saved from the wreck of the ship, and cov-
40
ering myself with a great watch-coat, I'took up this place
for my country retreat. Very frequently from this settle-
ment did I visit my boat, and keep her in good order.

You may easily suppose, that after having been here so
long, nothing could be more amazing than to see a human
creature. One day it happened, that, going to my boat, I
saw the print of a man's naked foot on the shore, very evi-_
dent on the sand, as the toes, heel, and every part of it.
Had I seen an apparition of the most frightful shape, I
could not have been more confounded. My willing ears
gave the strictest attention. I cast my eyes around, but
could satisfy neither the one nor the other. I proceeded
alternately to every part of the shore, but with equal efl'ect,
neither could I see any other mark, though the sand about
it was as susceptible to take impression as thatwhieh was _
so plainly stamped. Thus, struck with confusion and
horror, I returned to my habitation frightened at every
bush and tree, taking every thing for men, and possessed
with the wildest ideas. That night my eyes never closed;
I formed nothing but the most dismal imaginations; all my
religious hopes vanished, as though I thought God would'
not now protect me by his power, who had wonderfully
preserved me so long. -

In the morning I ventured out of my castle and milked -
my goats, one of which was almost Spoiled for want of it.-

1
I next (though in great fear) visited my bower, and milked
my flocks there also; when, growing bolder, I went down
to the shore again, and-111mg the print of the 'foot to
mine, to see perhaps whether I myself had not occasioned
that mark, I found it much superior in largeness; and so
returned home, now absolutely convinced, that either some
men had been ashore, or that the island must be inhabited,
and therefore that I might be'surprised before I was aware.

I began to think of providing for my security, and re-
solved in my mind many different schemes for that purpose.
I first proposed to cut down my inclosures, and turn my
tame cattle wild into the woods, that the enemy might not
find them, and frequent the island in hopes of killing the
same. Secondly, I was for digging up my corn-fields for
the very same reason. And lastly, I concluded to demolish
my bower, lest, seeing a place of human contrivance, they
might come farther, and find out and attack me in my little
castle. '

Such notions did the fear of danger suggest to me; and
I looked, I thought, like the unfortunate king Saul, when
not only oppressed by the Philistines, but also forsaken by
God. And it is strange, that, a little before, having entirely
resigned myself to the will of God, I should now have little
confidence in him, fearing those more who could kill this

fading body, than Him who could destroy my inunortal soul,

ROBINSON Cam

Wandering one day more to the west of the island" -
ever I had yet done, and casting my eyes towards the sea,

' methought I perceived a boat at a great distance, but could

not. possibly tell what it was for want of my perspective ,
glass. I considered then it was no strange thing to see the
print of a man's foot, and, concluding them cannibals,

. blessed God for being cast on the other side of the island,

where none of the savages, as I thought, ever came. But'
when I came down the hill to the shore, which was the
S. W. point of the island, I was confirmed in my opinion;
nor can any one describe my horror and amazement, when
I saw the ground spread with skulls, hands, feet, and bones--
of human bodies, and, particularly, I perceived a space like
a circle, in the midst of which had been a fire, about which
I conjectured these wretches. sat, and unnaturally sacrificed
and devoured their fellowcreatures.

The horror and loathsomeness of this dreadful spectacle
confounded my senses; I returned towards my habitation,
and, in my way thither, shedding floods of tears, and falling
down on my knees, gave God thanks for making my nature
contrary to these wretches, and delivering me so long out of
their hands.

Though reason and my long residence here had assured-
me that these savages never came up to the-thick woody:

part of the country, and that I had no reason to be appre-
' 43 '
hensive of a discovery, yet such an abhorrence did I still
retain, that, for two years after I confined myself only to
my plantations. In progress of time my dreadful appre-
hensions began to wear away, yet I was more vigilant for
fear of being surprised, and very cautious of firing my gun,
lest being heard by thOSe creatures, they should proceed to
attack me. I resolved, however, manfully to lose my life

 

if they did, and went armed with three pistols, stuck to my

. girdle, which gave me a very formidable appearance.
My circumstances for some time remained very calm and
undisturbed, and when I compared my condition with
others, I found it far from being miserable. Would all per-

l sons compare their circumstances, not with those above
44

them, but with those innumerable unhappy objects beneath
them, I am sure we should not hear those daily murmurings
and complainings that are in the world. The terror which
the savages had put me in, spoiled some inventions for my
own. convenience. For now my inventions were how I
might destroy some of these cannibals, when proceeding to
their bloody entertainments, and so saving a victim from
being sacrificed, that he might after become my servant.

I think I now was in the twenty-third year of my reign,
and my thoughts much easier than formerly, having con-
trived several pretty amusements and diversions agreeably
to pass away the time. By this time my pretty Poll had
learned to speak English, and pronounce his words very
articulately and plain, so that for many hours we used to
chat together in a familiar manner, and he lived with me
no less than twenty-six years. My dog, which was nineteen
years old, sixteen of which he lived with me, died some
time ago of more old age. As for my cats they multiplied
so fast, that I was forced to kill or drive them into the
woods, except two or-three which became my particular
favorites. Besides these, I continually kept two or three.
household kids about me, which I learned to feed out of my:
hand, and two m01e parrots which could talk indifi'erently,
and call Robinson C'msoe. I had also several sea-fowls,

which I had wounded and cut theii wings, and growing
I 4.5 ' -
tame, they used to breed among- the low trees about my
castle walls, all of which made my abode very agreeable.

But what unforeseen events suddenly destroy the enjoy-
ment of this uncertain life! It was now the month of De-
cember, in the southern solstice, and time of my harvest,
which required my attendance in the fields, when going out
pretty early one morning, before it was light, there appear-
ed from the sea-shore a flaming light, about two miles from
me, at the east end of the island, where I had observed
some savages had been before, not on the other side, but to
my great affliction, it was on my side the island.

Struck with a terrible surprise, and my usual apprehen-
sions, that the savages would perceive my improvements, I
returned directly to my castle, pulled the ladder after me,-
makiug all things look as wild and natural as I possibly
could. In the next place I put myself in a posture of
defence, loaded my muskets and pistols, and committing
myself to God's protection, resolved to defend myself till
my last breath. Two hours after, impatient for intelligence,
I ascended to the top of a hill, where, laying myself down,
_with my perspective-glass, I perceived no less than nine
'naked savages, sitting round a small fire, eating, as I sup-
posed, human flesh, with their two canoes hauled on shore,
waiting for the flood to carry them off again. I cannot

easily express the consternation I was in at this sight, but
46R0131 3503 mm

when I perceived their coming must be always with the
current of the ebb, I became more easy, being fully con-
vinced that I might go abroad with security all the time of
flood, if they were not before landed. Before they went
off, they danced, making ridiculous postures and gestures,
for above an hour, all stark-naked. When _I saw them .
gone, I took two guns upon my shoulders, and placing "a
couple of pistols in my belt, with my great sword hanging
by my side, I went to the hill, where at first I made the .;
discovery of these cannibals, and then saw there had been '
three canoes more of the savages on shore at that place, :
which with the rest were making over to the main land. '1
But nothing could be more hOrrid to me, when, going to
the place of sacrifice, the blood, the bones, and other man- ._
gled parts of human bodies appeared in my sight, and so
fired was I with indignation, that I was fully resolved to be
revenged on the first that came there, though I lost my life
in the execution. It then appeared to me, that the visits
which they make to this island are not very frequent, it
being fifteen months before they came again, but still I was _
very uneasy lest they should surprise me unawares.
That night I reposed myself in my canoe, covered with _
my watch? coat, instead of a blanket, the heavens being my '
tester. I set outwith the first of the tide full north, till I j

felt the benefit of the current, which carried me at a great
47
rate eastward, yet not with such impetuosity as before, as to
take from me all government of my canoe, so that in two
hours' time I came up to a. wreck. It seemed to be a.
Spanish vessel, stuck fast between two rocks, her stern and
quarter beaten to pieces by the sea, her mainmast and fore-
mast were broken ofi" short. As I approached near, I per-
ceived a dog on board, who, seeing me coming, yelped and
cried, and no sooner did I call him, but the poor crea-
ture jumped into the sea, out of which I took him up,
almost famished with hunger and thirst, so that when I
gave him a cake of bread, no ravenous wolf could
devour it more greedily; and he drank to that degree of
fresh water, that he would have biu'st himself, had I suffer-
ed him.

The first sight I met with in the ship, were two men
drowned in the cook-room or forecastle, inclosed in one
another's arms; hence I very probably supposed, that when
the vessel struck in the storm, so high and incessantly did
the waters break in and over her, that the men, not being
able to bear it, were strangled by the constant rushing in of
the waves. There were several casks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I could not be positive, which lay in the
lower hold, as were plainly perceptible by the ebbing out
of the water, yet were too large for me to pretend to med-
dle with; likewise I perceived several chests, which I sup-

48
ROBINSON CRUSOE.

posed to belong to the seamen, two of which I got into my
boat, without examining what was in them.

Searching further, I found a cask, containing abOut
twenty gallons of liquor, which, with some labor, I got into
my boat; in her cabin were several muskets, which I let
remain there, but took away with me a great powder-horn,
with about fom' pounds of powder. I took also a fire-shovel .
and tongs, two brass kettles, a copper pot to make choco- _
late, and a gridiron, all which were extremely useful to me,
especially the fire-shovel and tongs. And so with this
cargo, accompanied by my dog, I came away, the tide
serving for that purpose, and the same evening I attained
the'island, after the greatest toil and fatigue imaginable.

That night I reposed my weary limbs in the boat, resolv-
ing' the next morning to harbor what I had gotten, in my-
new-found subterr aneous grotto, and not to carry my cargo
home to my ancient castle. Having refreshed myself, and
got all my effects on shore, I next Oproceeded to examine
them, and tapping the cask, I found the liquor to be rum.
[n the chest I found a very _fine case of bottles, containing
the finest and best sorts of cordial waters; each bottle held _
about three pints, curiously tipt with silver. Also, two pots
full of the choicest sweetmeats, and two more which the
water had utterly spoiled. There were likewise several

good shirts, exceedingly welcome to me, and about one
49
dozen and a half white linen handkerchiefs and colored
neckcloths, the former of which were absolutely necessary
for wiping my face in a hot day ; and in the till I found three
bags of pieces of eight, about eleven hundred in all, in one
of which, decently wrapped up in a piece of paper, were
six doubloons of gold, and some small bars and wedges of
the same metal, which I believe might weigh near a pound.
In the other chest, which I guessed to belong to the gun-
ner's mate, I found only some clothes of very little value,
except about two pounds of fine glazed powder, in three
flasks, kept, as I believe, for charging the fowlingvpieces,
so that, in the Whole, I had no great advantage by this
voyage. The money was, indeed, as mere dirt to me, use
less and unprofitable, all which I would have freely parted
with for two or three pair of English shoes and stockings;
things that for many years I had not worn, except those
which I had taken off the feet of the unfortunate men I
found drowned in the wreck. When I arrived at my castle,
every thing seemed safe and quiet.

Having retired to my castle after my late voyage to the
ship, my frigate laid up and secured, as usual, and my con-
dition the same as before, except being richer, though I
had as little occasion for riches as the Indians of Peru had
for gold, before the cruel Spaniards came among them,

one night in March, being the rainy season, in the four-and-
50
twentieth year of my solitude, I lay down to sleep, very
well in health, without distemper, pain, or__uncommon unea<<
siness either of body or mind; yet, notwithstanding, I could
not compose myself to sleep. All this tedious time, it is

 

ROBINSON 0113803 WATCHING THE CANNIBALS HASTING-

impossible to express what innumerable thoughts came into
my head. I traced the Whole history of my life in minia-
ture, from my earliest remembrance of things till I came to

this island, and then proceeded to examine every thing that
51
had occurred since I had taken possession of my kingdom.
In my reflections upon the latter, I was comparing the
happy posture of my affairs in the beginning of my reign,
to this life of anxiety, fear, and concern, since I had discov-
cred a print of a foot in the sand. While my thoughts were
agitated, my resignation to the will of Heaven was entirely
suspended, so that I had no power to fix my mind to any
thing, but to the project of a voyage to the main land, till
nature, being, as it were, fatigued and exhausted with the
thoughts of it, made me submit myself to a silent repose.

Still bent on my deliverance from the island, I reflected
that one sure way of escaping was to get a savage ; that after
I had ventured my life to deliver him from the bloody jaws
of his devourers, the natural sense he might have of such a
preseryation, might inspire him with a lasting gratitude and
most sincere affection. I at length resolved, right or wrong,
to get one of these savages into my hands, even though I
should lose my life in the attempt. Inspired with this reso-
lution, I set my wits at. work to find out What methods I
should take to accomplish my design. This, indeed, was
so difficult a task, that I could not pitch upon any probable
means to execute; I therefore resolved continually to be in
a vigilant posture, to perceive when the savages came on
shore, and to leave the rest to that event.

Such were my fixed resolutions, and accordingly I set
52
myself upon the watch. I waited for above a year and a
half. This was a ve1 y creat discourdegage1nent , yet the edge
of my design was as keen as ever, and the longer it seemed
to be delayed, the more eager was I for it.

I was one day seriously musing how 1 should attain my

end, when I was very much surprised by seeing no less

than five canoes all on shore together, on my side of the"

island, and the savages that belonged to them all landed,

and out of my sight. Such a number of them disconcerted'
my measures; for, seeing so many boats, each of which,

would contain six, and sometimes more, I could not tell
how to order my measures; and much dispirited and per-

plexed, I lay still in my castle, which, however, I put in a: ' _
proper posture for an attack; and having formerly provided '
all that was necessary, was soon ready to enter upon an en- "

acement. Havino waited for some time 111 im atient
g o a ,

temper would let me bear it no longer; I set my guns at'
the foot of the ladder, and, as usual, ascended to the top'

of the hill ; and here, by the assistance of my perspective
glass, '1 observed no less than thirty in number around'a';

fire, feasting upon what meat they had dressed. How fife

cooked it, or what it was, I could not then perfectly tell; {i

but they were all dancing and capering about the flan'icg':
using many f1ightful and barbarous gestures

l

 

 

 
  

But while, with a curious eye, I was beholding these I

53
wretches, my spirits sunk within me, when I perceived
them drag two miserable creatures from the boats, to act
afresh the dreadful tragedy, as I supposed they had done
before. It was not long before one of them fell upon the
ground, knocked down, as I suppose, with a club or wooden
sword; while two or three others went immediately to work
cutting him open for their cookery, while the last unhappy
captive was left by himself till they were ready for him.
The poor creature looked round him with a wishful eye,
trembling at the thoughts of death; yet seeing himself a.
little at liberty, nature, that very moment, as it were, in-
spired him with hopes of life, he started away from them,
and ran, with incredible swit'tness, along the sands, directly
to that part of the coast where my ancient and venerable
castle stood.

You may well imagine I was dreadfully afl'righted upon
this occasion. However, my spirits beginning to recover, I
still kept upon my guard, and I now plainly perceived there
were but three men out of the number that pursued him.
I was infinitely pleased to see with what swiftness the poor
creature ran from his puisuers, gaining so much ground
upon them, that I plainly perceived, could he thus hold out
for half an hour, there was not the least doubt but he would
save his life from the power of his enemies.

Between them and my castle there was a creek, Where I
54-
much feared the poor victim would be taken, if he could
not swim for his escape. But soon was I out of pain for
him, when I perceived he made nothing of it, though at
full tide, but with an intrepid courage, spurred on by the
sense of danger, he plunged into the flood, swimming over

 

MAY 0!!"le HIS llOKAGB T0 ROBINSON OBUSO'

in about thirty strokes, and then, landing, ran with the
same incredible strength and swiftnese as before. When
the three pursuers came to the creek, one of them, who I
perceived could not swim, returned to his company, while
the others, with equal courage, but much less swiftness, at-
tained the other side, as though they were resolved never to
give over the pursuit. And now or never, I thought, was

the time for me to procure me a servant, companion, or
55
assistant. I immediately descended my two ladders with
the greatest expedition; I took up my guns, which, as I
said before, new at the bottom of them, and taking a sho1t
cut down the hill, I interposed between the pmsners and
pursued: hallooing aloud to the latter, who, venturing to
look back, was, no doubt, as much terrified at me as I at
them. I beckoned to him with my hand to return back;
in the mean time advancing towards the pursuers, and
rushing 011 the f01emost, I knocked him down 11 1th the
stock of my piece, and laid him flat upon the ground. I
was vet y unailling to fire, lest the rest should hear. The
other savage seeing his fellow fall, stopped as if he had
been amazed; when, advancing towards him, I could 11er-
ceive him take his bow from his back, and fixing his arrow
to it, was preparing to shoot at me. In this case of self-
preservation,I immediately fired at him and shot him dead,
just as his hand was going to draw the fatal string. All
this while the save go, tho had fled bet'cne, stood still, and
had the satisfaction to see his enemies killed. So afliighted
was he with the fire and noise of my piece, that he stood
fixed and immovable, without either sense or motion. This
obliged me to halloo to him again, making the plainest
signs I could to him to draw nearer. I perceived he un-

wax, when, as if afraid I should kill him too, he stopped

'6
again. Several times did he advance, and as often stop in
this manner, till coming more to my View, I perceived him
trembling, as if he was to undergo the same fate; upon
which I looked upon him with a smiling countenance, and
still beckoning to him, at length he came close tome, and
kneeled down, kissing the ground, laid his head upon it,
and taking me by the foot, set it upon his head; and this,
as I understood afterwards, was a token of swearing to be
my slave forever. I took him up, and, making much of
him, encouraged him in the best manner I could.

The great astonishment that my new servant conceived,
was the manner of killing the savage at such a distance,
without a bow and arrow. First he turned him on one side,
then on another, wondering he could perceive no quantity
of blood; and after sufficiently admiring the wound the
bullets had made in his breast, he took up his bow and
arrows and came back again; upon which I turned to go
away, making signs to him to follow, lest the rest, missing
their companions, might come in pursuit of them; and this
I found be conceived very well, by his making me under-
stand that his design was to bury them, that they might not
be seen if it happened, and which I made him sensible I
very much approved of. Immediately he fell to work, and
never was a. grave-digger more dexterous than he was; for
in an instant he scraped a large hole in the sand with his

' 5'7
hands, sufficient to bury the first in; there he dragged
him, and, without any ceremony, he covered him over; in
like manner he served the other. All this was done in less
than a quarter of an hour. I then called him away, and
instead of carrying him directly to my castle, I conveyed
him to my cave on the farther part of the island.

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and
water to drink; on which be fed very cheerfully, to his ex-
ceeding refreshment. I then made him a bed with a parcel
of rice straw, and a. blanket upon it, and pointing to it,
made signs for him to lie down to sleep; upon which the
poor creature went to take a welcome repose.

Indeed, he was a very handsome young fellow, extremely
well made, with straight long limbs, not too large, but tall
and well-shaped, and, as near as I could reckon, about
twenty-six years of age. His countenance had nothing in
it fierce or surly, but rather a sort of majesty, and, espe-
cially when he smiled, he had all the sweetness and soft-
ness of a European. His hair was not curled like wool, as
many of the blacks are, but long and black, with the most
beautiful yet careless tresses spreading over his shoulders.
He had a very high and large forehead, with a great vi?
vacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. His skin was
not so tawny as the Virginian Brazilians, or other Ameri--

cans, but rather of a bright dun olive-color, that had some

thing agreeable in it, though not very easy to describe.
His face was round and plump, with a small nose, very
different from the flatness of the negroes, a pretty small
mouth, thin lips, fine teeth, very well set, and white as the
driven snow. In aword, such handsome features, and. ex!

act symmetry in every part, made me consider that I had -

saved the life of an Indian prince.

As I understood him in many things, I made him sensi~
ble I was very well pleased with him; and in a little time

I began to speak to him, and taught him to talk to me ._
again. In the first place, I made him understand his name ,

"as to be Friday, because it was upon that day I saved his

life; then I tanght him to say Master, which I made him J
sensible was to be my name. I likewise taught him to say -
Yes and No, and to know what they meant. I gave him -

some milk in an earthen'pot, making him view me while I

drank it before him, and soaked my bread in it. I gave -
him a cake of bread, and caused him to soak it likewise, to '

which he readily consented, making signs of the greatest
satisfaction.

All that night I kept him there; but in the morning I A
ordered him to arise and come along with me, with certain}?
tokens that I would give him some clothes like mine, at '

which he seemed ve1 y glad, being stark naked.

I carried him with me to my castle, and gave him a pail

59
of linen drawers, which I had taken out of the poor gun-
ner's chest, and which, with a little alteration, fitted him
very well. In thenext place I made him a jerkin of goat's
skin, such as my skill was able to manage; and indeed I

thought myself then a tolerable good tailor. I gave him

 

{F.yflrg-tQ-t: , '_ - "N Lama."-

 

 

30313503 ORWOE msrnuorma FRIDAY IN RELIGION.

also a cap which I had made of a hare's skin, very conve-
nient and fashionable. Thus being clothed tolerahly well,
my man was no less proud of his habit than I was of seeing
him in it. Indeed he went very awkwardly at first, the

drawers being heavy on his thighs, not used to bear any
60
weight, and the sleeves of the waistcoat gelled his shoul-
ders and the inside of his arms; but by a. little easing where
he complained they hu1t him, and by using himself to
them, at length he took to them very well.

My next concern was, where I should lodge him; and-
that I might do well by him, and yet be perfectly easy my-;-
self, I erected a tent for him in the vacant place between-'1'
my two fortifications, in the inside of the last and the 011%-
side of the first; and as there was an entrance or door into
my cave, I made a formal framed door-case, and a door to '
open on the inside; I ban ed it up in the night-time, taking-
in my ladders too, so that, was my man to prove treachen"
011s, there could be no way to come at me in the inside of
my inneimost wall, without making so much noise in get-
ting over that it must waken me.

But there was no occasion for this precaunon; for surely
a master never had a more sincere, faithful, and loving eer-
vant than Friday proved to me. Without passion, sullen-
ness, ordesign, perfectly obliging and engaging, his afl'ec-v'
tions were as much tied to me as those of a child to its:
parents; and I might venture to say, he would have sacrie'e
ficed his life for the saving of mine, upon any occasion
whatsoever.'

One morning I took him out with me, with an mam;

._ to kill a kid out of the flock, and bring it home and dress;
61 .
it. As I was going, I perceived a she-goat lying down in
the shade, and two young kids sitting by her. Immediately
I catched hold of my man Friday, and bidding him stand
still and not stir, I presented my piece, and shot- one of the
kids. My poor servant, who, at a distance, perceived me
kill his adversary, and yet did not know by what means, or
how it was done, stood trembling and surprised, and looked
so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk into the
earth.

I brought home the kid, and the same evening took off
the skin and divided the car-case as well as I could. Part
of the flesh I stewed, and then, spreading my table, I sat
down, giving my man some of it to eat, who was wonder-
fully pleased.

It was now high time I should set my servant to work,
so next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it in
the same manner I had done before. And really the fellow
was very quick and handy in the execution of any thing I
ordered him to go about. I made him understand that it
was to make bread for us to eat, and afterwards let him see
me make it. In short, he did every thing I ordered him in
a little time, as well as I could perform it myself.

I must own, that this was the most pleasant year I ever
had in the island, for after some time Friday began to talk

- pretty well, and undelstood the names of those things which
62
I was wont to call for, and the places where I used to send"
him. So that my long silent tongue, which had been use.
less so many years, except in an exclamatory manner,
either for deliverance or blessings, now began to be occu
pied in teaching and talking to my man Friday, for .so inno-
cent did his simple and unfeigned honesty appear to me,
that I began entirely to love him, and I spared no pains or '
diligence to instruct him, according to my poor share of
knowledge, in the principles of religion, and the adoration
that he ought to pay to the true God. ' '

You may well suppose, that by the frequent discoursewe,
had together, my man and I became most intimately -
acquainted, and that there was but very little that I could .
say but what Friday understood; indeed he spoke very
fluently, though it was but broken English.

It was from this time I had strong inclinations to venture
over, and use my utmost efforts to join the white bearded
men, described to me by Friday as occupying the distant
coast, and who undoubtedly were Spaniards or Portuguese. '
To which intent mv man and I went to search 1'01 a proper '
tree to fell, whereof we might make a large canoe, to;
undertake the voyage, and indeed we were not long 1n findj
ing one fit for our purpose, there being enough wood m thief:
island to have built a fleet of large vessels; but the thing

we principally wanted, was to get one so near the <<ate:
63
that we might launch it after it was finished, and not com-
mit such a mistake as I had done once before.

After a great search for what was best and most conve-
nient, Friday, at last, whose judgment in such affairs was
much superior to mine, pitched upon a kind of wood most
fit for it. But though my man exceeded me in his knowl-
edge of the most proper tree, yet I showed him a much
better and clearer way to make a canoe than he know
before ; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity of the
tree, in order to make this boat, but I then told him how he
might do it with tools, instructing him at the same time
how to use them, which he did very dexterously, so that in
a month's time we finished it, making it very handsome, by
cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat. After this
it took us a full fortnight before we could get her into the
water, which we did, as it were, inch by inch, upon great
rollers; but when she was in, she would have carried *
twenty men, with all the ease imaginable.

As I was very well pleased, you may be sure, at the
launching of this man-of-war of mine, I was no less amazed
to behold with what dexterity my man would manage her,
turn her, and paddle her along. \Vell, Friday, said I,
what do you think of it now? Do you think this will carry
us over? " Yes, master," said he, " me venture over well,

though great blow wind." But my design was yet farther,
64
which he was insensible of, and that was to make a mast
and a sail, and to provide her with an anchor and cable.
As to a mast, that was no difficult thing to procure, so I
fixed upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near
the place, great plenty of it abounding in the island, and
setting Friday to cut it down, I gave him particular direc-
tions how to shape and order it, but as to the sail, that I
managed myself. I very well knew I had some old ones, .
or pieces of sails enough, which had lain six-and-twenty
years by me, but not being careful to preserve them, as
thinking I should have no occasion to use them any more,
when I came to overlook them, I found them all rotten ,
except two, and with these I went to work, and, after a i
great deal of pains, and awkward tedious stitching for want

of needles, at length I finished a threecornered ugly thing, -
like what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to

go with a boom at bottom, and a little small sprit at the
top, like those which our long-boats use, and which I very
well knew how to manage.

It was near two months, I think, before I completed this
work, and when all was done, I had my man to teach its
navigation, for though he very well understood how to pad-
dle a canoe along, he was an utter stranger to a sail and a t _.
rudder, and was amazed when he saw me work the boat by

them, and how the sail jibed and filled this way or that
: 6SS
way, as the course we sailed changed. After some time
and a little use, I made all these things very familiar to
him, so that he became an expert sailor, except in relation
to the compass, and that I could make him understand but
little of. But as it happened, there was seldom occasion
for it, there being but little cloudy weather, and scarce any
fog in those parts; the stars were always visible in the
night, and the shore perspicuous by day, except in the rainy
season, which confined every one to his habitation. And
this season beginning to come on, obliged me to keep the
longer within-doors; but before this, I brought my. new
vessel into the creek, where I had landed my rafts from the
ship, and hauling her up to the shore, I ordered my man
Friday to dig a dock sufficient to hold her in, and deep
enough to give her water, wherein she might float; and
then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam across
the end of it, to keep out the water, by which means she
lay dry, as to the tide from the sea; and to keep the rain
from her, we thatched her over, as it were, with boughs of
trees, like a house. So we waited for the months of Novem-
ber and December, in which I designed to venture over the
ocean.

As soon as the seasonable weather began to draw near, I
prepared for the voyage. The first thing I thought 011 was,
to lay by a certain quantity of provisions, as a sufficient

66 '
store for such an expedition, intending in a week or fortc
night's time to open the dock, and to launch out the boat
for that purpose. But one morning, as I was very busy
upon something necessary for this occasion, I called Friday
to me, and bid him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could
find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which we commonly had
once a. week, as much upon account of the eggs, as for the

sake of the flesh. He had not been long gone, before he

came running back, as though he was pursued for life, and,

as it were, flew over my outer wall, or fence, like _one that

felt not the ground, and before I had time to inquire the

reason of his precipitation, he cries- out, " O dear, master ;.

O sorrow, O sorrow! Bad! 0 bad !" Why,'what's the
67
matter, Friday? said I. "O yonder, yonder i" said he,
"there be one, two, or three canoes! two three l" Surely,
thought I, there must be six, by my man's way of reckon-
ing; but on a stricter inquiry, I found there were but three.
Well, Friday, said I, don't be terrified ; I warrant you we
will not only defend ourselves against them, but kill most
of these cruel savages. But though I comforted'him in the
best manner I could, the poor creature trembled so, I scarce
knew What to do with him. " 0 master," said he, "they
come look Friday; cut pieces Friday, cut a me up." \Vliy,
Friday, said I, they will eat me up as well as you, and my
danger is as great as yours. But since it is so, we must re-
solve to fight for our lives. What say you? Can you fight,
Friday? "Yes," said he, very faintly, "me shoot, me kill
What I can; but there come a great many number." That's
no matter, said I again ; our guns will terrify those we do
not kill ; I am very willing to stand by you to the last drop
of my blood. Now tell me if you will do the like by me,
and obey my orders in whatsoever I command? Friday
then answered," 0 master, me lose life for you; me die
when you bid die." Thus concluding all questions concern-
ing his fidelity, immediately I fetched him a good dram of
rum. After he had drank it, I ordered him to take the
two fowling--pieces, which we always carried, and load them

with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-bullets; then I
' GS -
took four muskets, and loaded them with two slugs and five

small bullets each, charging my two pistols each with a. .
brace: I hung my great sword, as customary, naked to my ,

 

l
*1

side, and gave Friday his hatchet, as a most excellent wea-

pen for defence.

Thus prepared, I took my perspectiveglass, and went up .
to the side of a hill to see what I could discover; and I per-- _
ceived very soon by my glass that there were one--and--twenty ;
savages, three prisoners, and three canoes, and that their 1

chief concern seemed to be the t1iumphant banquet upon
the three poor human bodies, a thing uhich by this time I '

had observed was ve1y common with them. I also re-:
1na1ked that they did not land at that place from whence.
Fliday made his escape, but near'e1 to the c1 eek Where the '
sho1e u as low, and whe1e a thick wood came very close to i
the sea. My soul was then filled uith indignation and a.b-'a 1
hor1ence at such inhuman wretches, which put a period to
all my former thoughts' 1n their vindication, neither would '
I give myself time to consider their right of conquest, asI
had done before; but descending from the mountain, I
came down to Friday, and told him I was resolved to go '
speedily to them, and kill them all, asking him again, in_
the same breath, it he would stand by me; when, by this '
time being recovered f1om his fright, and his spirits much

cheered with the dram I had given him, he seriously
69 '
told me, as he did before, " When I bid die, he would
die."

And I now divided the loaded arms betwixt us. To my
man Friday I gave a pistol to stick in his girdle, with three
guns upon his shoulder, a weight too great, I confess, to
bear; but what must a poor king do, who had but one sol-
dier in the world? But to show I made him bear no more
than what I would lay on myself, I stuck the other pistol in
my girdle, and the other three guns upon my shoulders;
nay, something more, a small bottle of rum, which was soon
lightened to our exceeding refreshment. Thus we marched
out, under a ponderous load of armor, like two invincible
champions, with a quantity of powder and bullets, to stand
our battle, and load again when the pieces were discharged.
I charged Friday to keep close behind me, and not to stir,
or shoot, or attempt any thing till I commanded him, and
in the interim, not to speak so much as one word.

I soon entered the thick wood (my man Friday following
close behind), when, with all possible weariness and silence,
I marched till I came to the skirt of it, on that side which
was the nearest to them; for only one end of the wood in
terposed between me and them. I called very softly to
Friday, and showing him a great tree that was just at the
corner of the wood, I ordered him to repair thither, and

bring me word if he could perceive their actions. He did
70-...,..

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

as I commanded him, and came back with this melancholy
stery, that they were all about their fire, eating the flesh of
one of their prisoners, and that another lay bound upon the
' sand, at a little distance from them, which they designed
for the next sacrifice; and this, he told me, was not one of
their nation, but one of those very bearded men who were
driven by a storm into their country, and whom he had so
often talked to me about. You may be sure that, upon
hearing this, my soul was ready to sink within me; when,
ascending a tree, I saw plainly by my glass a White man,
who lay upon the beach, with his hands and feet tied with
things resembling rushes, being covered with clothes, and
seemed to be an European. From the tree whole I took'
this prospect, I pe1ceived another tree, and a thicket be.
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than where I wag
which, by taking a small circle round, I might come at ail?-
diseovered, and then I should be within half a shot of theeo'
devourers. And going back about twenty paces, I got bo-
hind some bushes, which held all the way till I came to.
the other tree; and then I ascended a little rising ground,
not above eighteen yards' distance, where I had a full View
of these creatures, and could perceive all their actions.-

No less than nineteen sat upon the ground, close hud-
dled together, expressing all the delight imaginable at so,

barbarous an entertainment; and they had just sent the"
71
other two to murder this poor unhappy Christian, and bring
him limb by limb to their fire; for they were then going
to untie the bands from his feet in order for death, as feta
ters are knocked off the feet of malefactors before they go
to the place of execution. Hereupou, immediately turning
to my man Friday, Now, Friday, said I, mind what I say:
fail in nothing, but do exactly as you see me do. All
which he promising, I set down one of my muskets and
fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the same
by his; and with the other musket I took my aim at the
savages, bidding him do the like. Are you ready? said I;
"Yes, master," said he. Why, then, fire at them, said I;
and that very moment I gave fire likewise.

I only killed one and wounded two; but my man Friday,
taking his aim much better than I, killed two and wounded
three. You may be sure they were in a dreadful conster-
nation at such an unexpected disaster, and those who had
yet escaped our shot, immediately jumped upon their feet,
but were in such confusion, that they knew not which way
to run, not knowing from whence their destruction came.
We threw down our pieces, and took up others, giving a
second dreadful volley; but as they were loaded only with
swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we perceived only two of
s them fall, though many were wounded, who ran yelling and

' screaming about like mad creatures. Now, Friday, said I,
72
lay down your piece, and take up the musket, and follow
me. He did so, with great courage; when showing our-
selves to the savages, we gave a great shout, and made di-
rectly to the poor victim, who would have been sacrificed
had not our first fire obliged the butchers, with three others,
to jump into a canoe. By my order, Friday fired at them,
at which shot I thought he had killed them all, by their
falling to the bottom of the boat. However, he killed two,
and mortally wounded a third. In the mean time, I cut
the flags that tied the hands and feet of the poor creature,
and lifting him up, asked him, in the Portuguese tongue,
what he was ? He answered me in Latin, Christianus; but
so very weak and faint, that he could scarcely stand or'
speak. Immediately, I gave him a dram and a piece of A
bread, and asked him what countryman he was. He. said,
Hispauiola, and then uttered all the thankfulness imagin-
able for his deliverance. Seigm'or, said I, with as much
Spanish as I was master of, let us talk afterwards, but fight
now. Here, take this sword and pistol, and do what you
can. And, indeed, he did so with such courage and intre-
pidity, that he out two of them in pieces in an instant, the
savages not having the power to fly for their lives. Ior-
dered Friday to run for those pieces we had left at the tree,
which he brought me with great swiftness, and then I gave

him my musket, while I loaded the rest. , There happened '
73
a fierce encounter between the Spaniard and one of the
savages; and though the former was as brave as could be
expected, having twice wounded his enemy in the head,
yet being weak and faint, the Indian had thrown him upon
the ground, and was wresting my sword out of his hands,
which the Spaniard very wisely quitting, drew out his pis-
tol, and Shot him through the body, before I could come
near him, though I was running to his assistance. As for
Friday, he pursued the flying wretches with his hatchet,
dispatching three, but the rest were too nimble for him.
The Spaniard, taking one of the fowling-pieces, wounded
two, who running into the wood, Friday pursued and killed;
but the other, notwithstanding his wounds, plunged himself
into the sea, and swam to those who were left in the canoe,
which, with one wounded, were all that escaped out of one-
and-twenty.

The savages in the canoe worked very hard to get out of
our reach, and Friday was eager in pursuing them; and,
indeed, I was no less anxious about their escape, lest, after
the news had been carried to their people, they should re-
turn in multitudes, and destroy us. So, being resolved to
pursue them, I jumped into one of their canoes, and bid
Friday follow me; but no sooner was I in, than, to my sur-
prise, I found another poor creature bound hand and foot
for the slaughter, just as the Spaniard had been, with very

7-4
little life in him. I unbound him, and would have helped
him up, but he could neither stand nor speak, but groaned
piteously, thinking he was only unbound in order to be
slain. Hereupon, I bid Friday speak to him, and tell him
of his deliverance, when, pulling out my bottle, I made the
poor wretch drink a dram, which, with the joyful news he
had received, so revived him, that he sat up. As soon as
Friday heard him speak, and looked more fully in his face,
it would have moved any one to tears to perceive his un-
common transports. He kissed, embraced him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced, sung,
wrung his hands, and beat his face and head, like a dis- '
tracted creature, so that it was a great while before I could
make him speak or tell me what was the matter; but at'
last he told me it was his father.

I was infinitely moved to see the dutiful and tender afi'ec
tion this poor savage had to his aged parent. He would
sit down by him in the boat, open his breast, and hold his
father's head close to his bosom, half an hour together, to
cherish him. His arms and ankles, which Were stifi' and
numbed with binding, he chafed and rubbed with his hands.
Perceiving what the case was, 1 gave him some rum, which
proved of great benefit to him.

While we were thus employed, the savages were almost .

out of sight; and happy it was we did not pursue them, for .
75
there arose from the northwest such a violent storm, that I
could not suppose otherwise but that they were all drowned.
After this, I called Friday to me, and asked him if he had
given his father any bread? He shook his head, and said,
"None, not one hit; me eat a up all ;" so I gave him a
cake of bread, and likewise a dram for himself, and two or
three bunches of raisins for his father. Both these he car-
ried to him, for he would make him drink the dram to com-
fort him. I

Then he ran for an earthen jug of water for his father,
which revived his spirits more than all the rum I had given
him.

I then called Friday to me, and ordered him to carry the
Spaniard a cake and some water, who was reposing himself
under the shade of a tree, but so weak that, though he ex-
erted himself, he could not stand; upon which, I ordered
Friday to rub and bathe his ankles with rum, as he had
done his father's. Every minute he was employed in this,
he would cast a wistful eye towards the boat where he left
his father sitting, who suddenly disappearing, he flew like
lightning to him, and finding he had only laid himself down
to ease his limbs, he retumed to me presently, and then I
spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him, and lead him
to the boat, in order to be conveyed to my dwelling, where
1 would take care of him. Upon which, Friday took him

76 '
upon his back, and carried him to the canoe, setting him
close by his father, and presently stepping out again,
launched the boat ofl", and paddled it along the shore faster
than I could walk, though the Wind blew very hard; and
having brought them safe to the creek, he took them out of
, the boat; but so weak were they that I was forced to make
a kind of hand-barrow to convey them to my castle.

To get provisions for my poor weak subjects, I ordered
Friday to kill inc a yearling goat, which, when he had
done, I cut off the hinder quarters, and chopping it into
small pieces, boiled and stewed it, putting barley and rice
into the broth. This I carried into their tent, set a table,
dined with them myself, and encouraged them. Friday
was my interpreter to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard
too, who spoke the language of the savages pretty well;
After dinner, I ordered Friday to fetch home all our arms
from the field of battle, and the next day to bury the dead
bodies, which he did accordingly.

I made Friday inquire of his father whether he thought
these savages had escaped the late storm in their canoe?
and if so, whether they would not return with a power too
great for us to resist? He answered that he thought it
impossible they could outlive the storm; or, if they were
driven southwardly, they would come to a land where they

would he certainly devoured.
7 7
No canoes appearing soon after, as I expected, my appre-
hensions ceased, and my former thoughts of a. voyage re-
turned, especially when Friday's father assured me I should
have good usage in his nation. As to the Spaniard, he told
me that sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese,

who had been shipwrecked, made their escape thither; that
though they were in union with the savages, yet they were
very miserable for want of provisions and other necessaries.
When I aslccdhim about the particulars of his voyage, he

answered that their ship was bound from Rio de la Plata.
78
to the Havana; that when the ship was lost, only five men
perished in the ocean; the rest, having saved themselves
in the boat, were now landed on the main continent. And
what do they intend to do there? said 1. He replied, they
had concerted measures to escape by building a vessel, but
they had neither tools nor provisions, so that all their de-
signs came to nothing. Supposing, said I, I should make
a proposal, and invite them here, would they not carry me
prisoner to New Spain? He answered, No; for he knew
them to be honest men, who would scorn to act so basely
to their deliverer; that, if I pleased, he and the old savage
would go over and talk with them about it, and bring me
an answer; that they should all swear fidelity to me as
their leader; and he would not only do the same, but stand I
to the last drop of his blood, should there be occasion.
These solemn assurances made me resolve to grant them
relief, and to send these two over ('01 that purpose; but
\\ hen e\ e1 y thing was 1eady, the Spaniaid raised an object'-
tion, w hich cariied gleat weight with it: " You know, sir,"
said he, "that having been some time with you, I cannot
but be sensible of your stock of rice and corn, sufficient,
perhaps, for us at present, but not for them, should they
come over presently, much less to victual a vessel for an
intended voyage. Want might be as great an occasion for
them to disagree and rebel, as the children of Israel did
79
against God himself, when they wanted bread in the wil-
derness; and, therefore, my advice is, to wait another har-
vest, and in the mean time cultivate and improve more
land, whereby we may have plenty of provisions, in order
to execute our design."

This advice of the Spaniard's I approved extremely, and
so satisfied was I of his fidelity, that I esteemed him ever
after. We all four went to work upon some more land,
and against seed-time we had so much cured and trimmed
up as was sufficient to sow twenty-two bushels of barley and
sixteen jars of rice. As we were four in number, and by
this time all in good health, we feared not a hundred In-
dians, should they venture to attack us; and while the corn
was growing, I pitched upon some trees fit to build us a
large vessel, in case the Spaniards came over, which being
marked, I ordered Friday and his father to cut them down,
appointing the Spaniard, who was now my privy-councillor,
to oveisee and direct the whole. I likewise increased my
-.- "flocks of goats, by shooting the wild dams, and bringing
home their kids to my inclosure. Nor did I neglect the
grape-season, but cured them as usual, though I had such
a quantity now as would have filled eighty barrels with
raisins. And thus all of us being employed, they in work-
ing, and I in providing for them, till harvest came, God
Almighty blessed the increase of it so much, that out of

80
twenty-two barrels of barley, we threshed out two hundred
and twenty, and the like quantity of rice, sufficient to vict-
11al a ship fit to ca1ry me and all the Spaniards to any
pent of America.

Thus the principal objection being answered, I sent my
two ambassadors over to the main land, with a regal author-
ity to administer the oaths of allegiance and fidelity, and
have an instrument signed under their hands, though I '
never asked whether they had pen, ink, or paper; when,
giving each of them a musket, eight charges of powder and
ball, and provisions enough for eight days, they sailed
away with a fair gale.

Scarce a fortnight had elapsed, when, impatient for _'
their return, I laid down to sleep one morning, when a
strange accident happened, which was ushered in by Fri-
day's running to me, and calling aloud, " Master, master,
they are come, they are come." Upon which, not dream-
ing of any danger, out I jumped from my bed, put on my
clothes, and hurried through my little grove, when looking ' :;
towards the sea, I perceived a boat about a league and a 'i
half distant, str nding in for the shore with the wind fair.
I beheld they did not come from the side where the land
lay, but flom the southernmost end of the island. So these
being none of the people we wanted, I ordered Friday to

lie still till I came down from the mountain, which I now '
81
ascended, in order to discover more fully what they were,
'and, with the help of my perspective-glass, I plainly per-
ceived an English ship, which filled we with such uncom-
mon transports of joy as I cannot describe, and yet some
secret doubts hung about me, proceeding from I know not
what cause, as though I had reason to be upon my guard.

It was not long before I perceived the boat approach the

'shore, as if they were looking for a place where they might
conveniently land; and at last they ran their boat on shore
upon the beach, about half a mile distant. . Now I was
fully convinced they were all Englishmen, three of which
were unarmed and bound; when immediately the first four
or five leaped on shore and took those three out of the boat
as prisoners; one of whom, I could perceive, used the most
passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, while
the others showed great concern.

Not knowing the meaning of this, I was very much as-
tonished, and I beckoned to Friday, who was below, to
ascend the mountain. " 0, master," said he to me, " you
see English mans eat prisoners as well as savage mans."
"And do you' think they will eat them, Friday?" said I.
" Yes," said Friday, "they eat a all up." " No, no," said I.
"Friday, I am much more concerned lest they murder
them; but as for eating them up, that I am sure they will
never do."

82
I lamented that I could not come within shot of them un-
perceived, and save these three men, Whom I thought they
were going to kill. But some comfort it was to me, that I-
perceived they were set at liberty to go Where they pleased, .

mind to see the place; and so long did they negligently-J;
ramble, that the tide had ebbed so low as to leave the boat;
aground. Nor were the two men who were in her more}
circumspect; for, having drunk a. little too much liquor,

they fell fast asleep; but one of them waking before
' 83
other, and perceiving the boat too fast aground for his
strength to move, he hallooed out to the rest, who made all
possible expedition to come to him; but as Providence
ordered it, all their force was ineffectual to launch her,
when I could hear them speak to one another, ".Why let
her alone, J ack, can't ye, she'll float next tide ;" by which
I was convinced they were my own countrymen. I took
two fusees 011 my shoulder, and gave Friday three muskets;
besides, my formidable goat-skin coat and monstrous cap
made me look as fierce and terrible as Hercules of old,
especially when two pistols were stuck in my belt, and my
naked swo1d hangingb y my side.

It was my design at first not to make any attempt till it
was dar;k and it being new two o'clock, 1n the very heat
..of the day, the sailors weie all straggling 1n the woods, and
undoubtedly were lain don-n to sleep The th1ee p001 dis-
tressed creatures, too anxious to get any repose, were seated
under the shade of a great tree, about a quarter of a mile
from me. Upon which, without any more ado, I approached
them, with my man following behind me, and before I was
perceived, I called aloud to them in Spanish, "What are
ye, gentlemen?"
I At these w01ds they started up in g1 eat confusion, when
they beheld the stiange figure I made. They 1eturned no
i answer, but seemed as if they would fly from me. " Gen-
1 84
tlcmen," said I, in English, "don't be afraid; perhaps you
have a friend nearer than you expect." " He must be from
heaven," said one of them, gravely, pulling off his hat, "for
we are past all help in this world." "All help is from
heaven," said I; "but, sir, as I have perceived every ac,
tion between you and these brutes since your landing, only-
inform me how to assist you, and I Will do it to the utmost
of my power." V

" Am I talking with God or man," said he. "Are you
of human kind or an angel ?" "Sir," said I, "my. poor
habit will tell you I am a man, and 'an Englishman, Willing;
to assist you, having but this servant. Here are arms and;
ammunition; tell freely your condition. Can we save you???
"The story," said he, "is too long to relate, since. and
butchers are so near; but, sir, I was master of that ship;
my men have mutinied, and it is a favor they have put myj
mate, this passenger, and me on shore, without murdering
us, though we expect nothing but perishing here." "Are
your enemies gone 2" said I. "No," replied he, pointing.
to a thicket, " there they lie; while my heart trembles, lest;
having seen and heard us, they should murder us 9.11.3
" Have they firearms?" said I. " They have but mi:
pieces," said he, "one of which is left in the boat." He
also told me there were two enormous villains among themja

that were the authors of this mutiny, who, if they .7?
85 '
killed or seized, the rest might return to their obedience.
" Well, well," said I, "let us retire farther under cover of
the woods ;" and there it was I made these conditions with
him:

1. That, while they stayed in the island, they should not
pretend to any authority; but should entirely conform to
my orders, and return me the arms which I should put in
their hands.

2. That, if the ship was recovered, they should afford
Friday and myself a passage gratis to England.

When he had given me all the satisfaction I could desire,
: I gave him and his two companions, each of them, a gun,
I with powder and ball snflicient, ad visi ng them'to fire upon
them as they lay sleeping. The captain modestly said, that
he was sorry to kill them; though, on the other hand, to
i let these villains escape, who were the authors of his
l misery, might be the ruin of us all. " \Vell," said he, "do
, as you think fit ;" and so accordingly I fired, killed one of
lthe captain's chief enemies, and wounded the other, who
' eagerly called for assistance; but the captain, who had re-
iserved his piece, coming up to him, "Sirrah," said he,
i " 'tis too late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to
' God to pardon your villanyf' and so knocked him down
i with the stock of his gun. Three others were also slightly
86
wounded, who, at my approach, cried out for help. This?
the captain granted, upon condition that they would swear
to be true to him in recovering the ship, which they sol-
emuly did; howeve1,I obliged the captain to keep them
bound. After which I sent F1iday and the captain's mate
to seculc the boat, and bring away the oars and sails;
when, at their return, three men coming back and seeing
their late distressed captain now their conqueror, submitted-
to be bound also. And then it was, that, having more lib!
erty, I related the adventures of my own life, which he
heard with serious attention. Afte1 this, I cauied him and
his two companions into my little fo1t1hed castle; showedi
tl- .em all my conveniences, and 1efieshed them with suc
p1ovisions as I could afihrd. W hen this was over, wag
began to conside1 about 1egaining the ship. He said there;
were tw cnty-six hands on O'boaxd, who, knowing their liv
were forfeited by the law for conspiracy and mutiny, werei
so very hardened, that it would be dangerous for our smal,
company to attack them. This was a reasonable inferenzi
indeed; but something we must 1esohe 011, and immhfi
diately put in execution. W'e, therefo1e, heat ed the
upon the beach, so high that she could not shoot ofi'i'g
high-water mark, and broke a hole in her not easily to" :
stepped; so that all the signals they gave for the boat?
Come on bgard were in vain. This obliged them to set:-

'- 87
another boat ashore, with ten men armed, whose faces the
captain plainly described, the boatswain being the chief
ofiicer; but he said there were three honest lads among
them, who were forced into the conspiracy. Hereupon I
gave him fresh courage. When the sailors landed, and
beheld their boat in that condition, they not only hallooed,
but fired for their companions to hear, yet they receive-d
no answer. This struck them with horror and amazement;
and thinking they were murdered, they made as if they
would return to the ship. I could perceive the captain's
countenance change at this; till of a sudden, three men
were ordered to look after the boat, while the other seven
leaped on shore in order to search for their companions;
and, indeed, they came to the brow of the hill, near my
ancient castle, from whence they could see to a great dis-
tance in the woods, and there shouting and hallooing till
tired and weary, they at length seated themselves under a
spreading tree. My opinion was, that nothing could be
done till night, when I might use some artifice to get them
all out of the boat; but of a sudden they started up and
made to the seaside. I then ordered Friday and the cap-
, tain's mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud as they
; could, and so decoying them into the u oods, come ionnd to
i me again. And thisf indeed, had good effect; for they fol-

,Iowed the noise, till coming w estward to did? creek, they
4 83
called for their boat to carry them over, and taking one of
the men out of her, left two to look after her, having fast-
ened her to the stump of a little tree on shore. Ilereupon
immediately the captain and our party passing the creek
out of their sight, we surprised them both, by the captain's
knocking down one and o1de1ing the othe1 to suirender
upon pain of death; and who, being the honestest of them
all, sinceie'lfi joined with us. By this time it was pretty
late; when the rest retiuning to their boat, which they
found aground in the creek, the tide out, and the men
gone, they ran about wringing their hands, crying it was
an enchanted island, and that they should be all murdered
by spirits or devils. My men would willingly have fallen
upon them, but I would not agree to hazard any of our
_ party. But to be more certain, Friday and the captain
crawled 'upon their hands and feet, as near as possible;
and, when the boatswain approached in sight, so eager was
the captain, that he fired and killed him on the spot; Fri-
day wounded the next man, and a third ran away. Here-
upon I advanced with my whole army; and it being dark,
I ordered the man we had surprised in the boat to call them
by their names, and to pailey with them, which he did, and
they were at length induced to lay down their arms in token
of submission.

_ After this,%e captain expostulated with them, telling
89
them that the governor was an Englishman, who might
execute them here, but he thought they would. all be sent
to England, except Will Atkins, who was ordered to pre-

begged they might not he sent to England V This answered

- they would assist in recoveiing the ship. Upon which
they all p1omrsed to stand by him to the last d1op of their
blood, and whoever acted t1ez1cheiously should be hanged I
in chains upon the beach. They were all 1eleased on these
assuranccsnnd the captain 1epaired to the other boat,
making his passenger. captain of hen, and gave him four
men well armed, while himself, his mate, and five more
went in the other boat. By 111idnight they came Within

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

"my dearest friend and deliverer, there is your ship, and
we are your servants," a comfort so unspeakable as made
me swoon in his arms, while, with gratitude to heaven, we
were tenderly embracing each other.

Nothing new remained, but to consult What we should do
with the prisoners, whom he thought it was not safe to take
on board. Concerting with the captain, I dressed myself in
one of his suits, and sending for them, told tH6611 that I was
going to leave the island with all my people, if they would
stay there, their lives should be spared, if not, they should
be hanged at the first port they came to. They agreed to
stay. Herenpon I told them my whole sfiy, charging
them to be kind to the Spaniards that were expected, giving
them all my arms, and informing them of every thing neces-
sary for their subsistence, after which I and my man Friday
went on board. But the next morning, two of the men
came swimming to the ship's side, desiring the captain to
take them on board, though he hanged them afterwards,
complaining 110W barbaronsly the others used them.
Upon which I prevailed with the captain to take them in,
and being severely whipped, they proved more honest for
the future. Thus I bade farewell to this island, carrying
along with me my money, my parrot, umbrella, and goat's
skin cap; setting sail December 13, 1686, after twenty-eight

93THE YOUNG SAILOR.

0-.

ON ane of those cold, raw days, so frequent" '
in England, even after the summer is pretty '-
far advanced, an elegant travelling equipag'e; 3*;
was seen wheeling across the bleak barren '.,_
waste called Alaston Moor, in the northwestern _':
extremity of the island. The only person in '.
the inside of the vehicle was a lady, who
though no longer to be called young, had: not ..
yet outlived the inveliness which nature had-
originally stamped on her beautiful face, i 'd
as she kept putting her head out of th'egf

    
 

riage window, and gazing at the heath-(35:, .
hills, at the foot of which the read now began

to wind, 3. tinge of tendenmelancholy gave
(5)
additional interest to her fine expressive coun~
tenance. " Yes, though so cold and dreary,
I love you still, my dear native hills ;" she
exclaimed, with a burst of natural feeling;
"and would not exchange your rich purple
heather, for all the luxuriant vines that clothe
the cloud-capped mountains I have so lately
left. They are beautiful and grand, but you
have a charm which makes its way more closely
to the heart, for you speak of home, and tell
of those early days when sorrow was unknown.
I left you, many years ago, a young and joyful
bride, with the anticipations of a happy future
to gladden my path, and the hope of soon
revisiting you, and my fondly doating parents ;
but, alas! I now return with a widowed heart,
and after weeping over the graves of husband
and children, seek the scenes of my early
years, though they, who once gave charms to
the spot, are no longer here to fold me in their
paternal embrace Still, however, I have
duties to perform, for those who, till lately,
partook of their benevolence, are now left to
my care; and my enjoyment in life for the
future, must be in faithfully discharging the
office assigned to me." Scarcely had she
breathed these words, (for she could hardly be
said to speak them,) when her eye was caught
by a very young boy, evidently not above eight
years old, seated on the sheltered side of the
hill, with a sort of plaid or coarse blanket
. rolled about him, so as to cover all but his eyes
and one hand, in which he held a small book,~
that he was poring over with such earnestness
as to be wholly unconscious of the approach
of the carriage. Struck with the novel sight
of a student among the natives of these wilds,
the lady pulled the check-string, and the horses
were immediately stopped, when she put for-
ward her head and called the little fellow to
come to her. At the sound of her voice, the

boy raised his head with a start, and threw
the plaid back. As he did so, he discovered
a face of perfect loveliness, and one to which
we utterly despair of doing justice. Its form
was of the finest oval, and his features might
have been moulded for a sculptor to study, so
nice were their proportions and so delicate
their outlines. His large, full, and beautifully
formed eyes, were of that clear deep gray in
which is generally found so happy a union of
softness and spirit. If there could be a fault
found in his appearance, it was in the almost
whiteness of his hair, but it was luxuriant and
wavy, whilst his childish age gave promise of
its soon acquiring a deeper hue. The propor-
tions of his body were in harmony with those
of his face, and, as he came forward obedient
to the lady's summons, divested of his coarse
mantle, she acknowledged to herself, that in
all her travels, she had never met with a finer
or more engaging specimen of childish beauty.

" What are you studying so closely, my littu
man?" she asked in a tone of kind encourag-
ing familiarity, as the child came near the ,
carriage door.

"I am trying to learn to read, my lady ;"
replied the boy respectfully, and in an exceed-
ingly sweet tone of voice.

" flying to learn," repeated the gentle traf-
veller , " you surely don' t expect to learn with-
out a teacher?"

"Oh no! my lady, I've had a teacher, for
Uncle Andrew, the last time he was here,
brought me this Read-may-desy ;" and as the
boy spoke he held up the juvenile school-
book, so well known by the title of Reading
made easy; "and he learned me my arb-abs,
and said I must make out as much more as I
could, by myself, till he came bac ."

" And when will that be '3"

"He said he thought he would be back in
three or four months, for he 's a pether, and he
expected his pack would be empty by that"
time, and he would be on his way to Paisley
to get it filled again."

"And how much have you learned?"

"I can tell of, and too, and is, and in, and
all the words that have only two letters, with-
out spelling them, and most of them that have
three 3"

" Have you been studying all the morning
as closely as you were doing just now?"

" No, my lady ; I had n't time to do that, for
my step-mother gave me a task, to knit forty
pearl of daddy's stocking, but I worked very
hard to get it done, and have been at my book
ever since."

"What is your name, my little fellow ?"
asked the lady, in a tone that proved her to
be very much interested in her new acquaint-
ance.

"My name is William Robson, but every-
body calls me White-haired Billy l"

" Are you the son of Thomas Robson '3"
' asked the stranger, to whom early reminis-
cence seemed to occur.

"Yes, my lady, daddy's name is Tommy
Robson."

"And who is this uncle Andrew that you
speak of?"

"Oh, he's not my right own uncle; he's
only a pether that always sleeps at our house
when he comes this way, and he told me to call
him uncle, and I like to do it, because he's so
good to me. He always tells me about the far-
off places he has been at; and he said, if I
would learn to read, he would bring me books
that would tell me a great deal more about
them than he could." '

"Then you are very anxious to learn, of
course '2"

" Oh yes,,my lady, I would rather study my
book than eat my supper when I go home,
however hungry I may be. But my step-
mother won't let me look into a book when
I'm at. home, for she says there's no use in
it."

"How long is it since you lost your own
mother '3"

"It's a long while since; I can only just
remember how kind she was to me!" and as
the poor little fellow spoke, his eyes filled with
tears, which told at once the sad change he had
found in her successor.

" Would you like to go to school, William?"
asked the lady, kindly seeking to turn the
current of the child's thoughts.

"Oh yes, my lady, I would rather go to
school than ride in that line coach, or wear
such fine clothes as them gentlemen have 011;"
and he pointed to the footmen and postilious,
whilst the lady sniled at his artlessness and
simplicity. " But," he added and as he did
so, his countenance, which had brightened at
the thought of school, changed to a. mournful
expression--"that. can never be."
"Why not?"

" Because daddy would have nobody then to
take care of the sheep l"

" But if the sheep could be taken care of
without you, are you sure you would be a good,
diligent boy at school '2"

" Oh yes," replied the boy, whilst his eyes
again sparkled, and his Whole face beamed
with delight at the thought; "I'm sure I
would, for I want so to learn to read. Uncle
Andrew says if I could read, I might soon
know a vast deal more than even he knows,
and that would be a great deal, for oh, how
wise he is! You would wonder to hear the
strange things he has told me. He once told
me something that I can hardly believe, but
yet everybody says that Uncle Andrew was
never known to tell a lie!"

" And pray what was it that he told you '2" -

asked the lady, smiling at the boy's earnest-
mess.
" Well he told me," said the child with some
little hesitation; " but perhaps he was only
joking," he continued, as if anxious to soften
any apparent imputation on his friend's verae
city-- "he said there were some folks in the
world, that were as block allover their bodies,
as a new shoe that has just been greased 1"
As the boy uttered these words, he looked up
with an expression of apprehension into the
face of his hearer, as if fearful that he had, by
so strange a tale, injured Uncle Andrew in her
good opinion. *

"Well you may keep yourself easy, Wil-
liam," returned the stranger with a. gentle
laugh, "about the truth of Uncle Andrew's
information, for I can assure you that he told
you nothing but What is strictly true."

" Oh how I would like to read about all such
things," said the child in a. tone of earnest
wishfulness.

" Iwill see to that, my little man. So earn-
est a desire for information shall not be left
without the means of gratifying itself. Tell
your father, when you go home at night, that
' the Lady of the Bower ' wishes him to come
up as soon as possible to speak to her."

"The Lady of the Bower!" repeated the
boy in extreme surprise.

"Yes, did you ever hear of her ?"

"I have heard of the old 'Lady of the

Bower,' that was good to everybody, -but the

young one, they say, is far off in foreign coun-
tries."

"She was; but she is now here, and it is
she that has been talking to you so long. You
appear to be a good boy and anxious to improve
yourself, and if I find you are really so, you
may depend on having a kind friend in me."
So saying the lady gave orders to her servants

to drive on, and her equipage was soon out- of
sight.
We flatter ourselves that the specimen we.
have now given of our little hero, has been
sufficient to excite an interest in his future
history in the minds of our young readers,
though the limits assigned to us will not allow
us to be very minute in our details of his pro-
ceedings, during the three years succeeding the
return of ' the Lady of the Bower ' to the home
of her youth, which introduced 1William to
her knowledge, and brought him forward as
the object of her especial care and attention.
The first moment she saw him, she discovered
strong marks of superior talents, as well as
the most amiable dispositions, and she imme-
diately determined to foster the buds which
were opening so fair:

" Though poverty's cold winds and piercing rains
Beat keen and heavy on his tender years.' '

Arrangements were soon made for William
to go to the nearest school, which offered any
chance of his benefiting by the instruction he
would receive there. It would have been a.
pleasure to his benevolent patroness, to send-
lllln at once to a higher seminary, as a boarder,
but she was deterred by the fear that so and
den a transition might have an unfavourable
' effect upon his mind, and loosen those cords of
filial afi'ect'ion, which ought ever to be held
sacred, and engender feelings of pride and self
consequence, at finding himself raised so far
above the rest of his family. She satisfied
herself, therefore, with having him frequently
at the hall during his hours of leisure, and
keeping a constant superintendence over him,
and watching the progress he made in his stu-
dies. This she found to be far beyond her.
most sanguine expectations. His whole soul
seemed to be engrossed with alove of learning,
and of gaining a. knowledge of the distant
wonders, the description of which had so often

entranced his young mind. We say that it
2
engrossed his whole soul; but we would not
be misunderstood that it did so, to the exclu
sion of the still more valuable affections of the
heart. Poor William had hitherto had little
around him calculated to fan the pure and holy
flame of domestic love; for his father, though
disposed to be a kind parent, was afraid to tes-
tify much tenderness towards his eldest child,
as every exhibition of the kind was sure to
excite the jealousy of his termagant wife, who
never failed to revenge it upon the unofi'ending
boy. Such behaviour in the mother, could
hardly fail to produce corresponding conduct
in the offspring, and consequently each child
as it grew up, learned to treat the amiable and
affectionate William as an enemy instead of a
brother. Each one, however, whilst in a state
of infancy, was an object of that brother's
tenderness, and served to keep the power of
loving still alive in his gentle bosom. And
happy was it for him that such was the case,' \

for the drudgery of nursing the infants was
always his portion, and would have been a
most irksome one, had not affection sweetened
the cup and changed the toil into a labour of
love. Then too, Uncle Andrew, with his angel
visits, called forth all the best feelings of the
young boy's heart, at the same time that he
incited him to mental improvement, and im-
pressed upon his mind the principles of truth
and virtue. But the appearance of this kind
friend was both infrequent and uncertain, and
William was often left without a single object
to be kind to except his dog, or an occasional
stray lamb; till " the Lady of the Bower"
came, and, by her kind encouraging care, called
forth all the finest feelings of his nature. Un-
der her guidance and protection, William's life,
which had hitherto been spent amidst the
clouds and storms of domestic dissension, was
converted into a soft and balmy sunshine; for
ev en his cruel stepmother was awed into treat-
ing him with gentleness, from her fear of " the
Lady of the Bower," under whom they held
their farm.

In this manner three years passed over the
head of our little hero, and converted him into
a tall, intelligent boy of eleven years old. His
personal appearance had been rather improved
than injured by the advance of years, espe~
cially as his hair, under the care of his patron
ess, had now become a beautiful auburn, whilst
the countenance which had before only spoken
of amiability and gentleness, 10w beamed with
intelligence, ardour, and spirit. His fondness
for reading had not only been indulged, but
judiciously directed, and his eagerness to make
himself acquainted with foreign parts gratified
by a selection of the best books of travel. All,
however, that he read only served to feed one
predominant passion, which had held its sway
over his breast " from the first dawn of
thought,"-\-that of being himself a witness of
the wonders that had taken so strong a hold
of his imagination.

But a shadow now came over our young
friend's happy life, and proved to him, even at
that early period, that our course through this
world is a chequered path, made up of lights
and shades, and that the brightest sunshine is
often succeeded by the darkest clouds. The
first interruption to his happiness arose from
the evident decline of the health of his amiao
ble patroness, which obliged her to seek a more
genial climate than that of the bleak hills and
barren moors of her native country. On leav-
ing, she promised the almost inconsolable boy,
that as soon as she returned from Portugal,
whither she was going to spend the winter,
and had fixed upon a place of residence in the
southern part of England, she would send for
him to join her there. In the mean time she
left directions with his father for his regular
attendance at school, the expenses of which

Ubith" .. A ,.-;..- ':
her steward would defray, and would also sup-
ply him with all the clothes, books, and other
useful articles that he might require. The
parting between her and her little protege was
a truly affecting one ; for William, who seemed
to forebode some coming evil, though he tried
to control his feelings, was unable to repress
the swelling of his heart, at the thought that
he was perhaps bidding farewell for ever to one
of the best and kindest of friends.

This bitter trial was shortly after suc-
ceeded by another, which produced still more
disastrous consequences to the poor boy; for
his father was accidentally killed by the falling
of an old building, and his destitute family
was all at once left to depend upon the efforts
of his widow alone. It may easily be imagined
that, under these circumstances, all that she
had to do for William was considered a hard-
ship; and, as the steward who had been left
by the Lady of the BQWCT, had always beenROBINSON RESCUES FRIDAY.'W "W.- 21' --,

jealous of the boy for having met with so
much more favour than his own children, that
in his eyes were quite as deserving, refused to -
extend any further indulgence than was con-
tained in his instructions, poor William soon
began to find his situation' most distressing.
One of the first things that the stepmother did
was to dismiss the boy that had been engaged
to tend the sheep in William's stead, and to
oblige him to resume his old employment.
This, however, would have been cheerfully
' submitted to by the poor boy, had he been per-
mitted to make his books his companions; but
this was positively prohibited, and a long task
of knitting imposed upon him instead. Nor
was this all. When night came, and the sheep
were all safely shut up in the fold, and William .
hoped he might indulge himself with reading,

he was, instead, set to card wool, and was so
vigilantly watched at the employment that he
had not a moment te himself Sometimes,
after a day's exposure to. the cold air, the
warmth of the fire would produce an irresist-
ible drowsiness, but if the poor little fellow
lost, for a moment, the recollection of his
troubles in the sweet oblivion of sleep, a severe
blow on his head soon restored him to con-
sciousness, whilst the discordant voice of his
stepmother 'ang in his ear as she exclaimed,
" Now, may be you will keep awake! There
would be no sleeping if- you were at your use-
less books, but I wonder if they would feed
you. Them that want to eat must be willing
to work. I'll make you sure, I'm not going
to feed an idle fine gentleman." William wrote
several letters to his patroness, begging to be
permitted to come to her; but he had no other
means of sending them, except through the
steward; but no intimation of their having
reached their destination ever arrived to relieve
the poor boy's snflbrings. Even Uncle Andrew
had ceased his usual visits, for the excellent
old man had now become incapable of travel-
ling, and poor William had no hope but that
which the approach of spring gave him of the
return of his patroness. I

Spring, however, is often long of appearing,
even after it has assumed the name; and Wil-
liam's cruel and tyrannical stepmother became
every day more severe in her afflictions. The
poor boy tried earnestly to bear with patience
the hardships she imposed upon him; but hope
deferred, we are told, maketh the heart sick,
and he had looked so long for the appearance
of the only person from Whom he could expect
relief, that he at length came to the resolution
of leaving his home unknown to anypne, and
making his way, as he best could, to New-
castle, where he had often heard that vessels
from various parts of the world are always to
be found. He had no doubt of meeting with
a ship bound for Lisbon, and was equally satis-

fied that it would not be a diflicult thing to '
prevail upon the captain to give him a passage
for the services he could render; for though
young, he was strong and active, and as for
willingness, no one, he was sure, would excel
him in that. If once at Lisbon, he could not
believe he would have any difficulty in finding
the Lady of the Bower, for he would seek out
the largest and grandest house, and that would
be sure to be hers. My young readers who
have been accustomed to large cities will won-
der at William's imagining he could so easily
find out his patroness in such a place as Lis-
bon, but they must consider that we can only
form an opinion of a thing by comparing it
with another, and as the little fellow had never
seen anything beyond the bleak moor on which
he lived, on the borders of which were scat-
tered a few poor hovels, he naturally imagined
that the Hall of the Bower was a. magnificent
building, and that a similar one would easily
be distinguished from those surrounding it. It
is true he had read books of travels, but expe'
rience tells us how very poor a conception we
are able to form of an object, even from tht.
most lucid description, unless some other fami'
liar one is presented to us for the purpose of
comparison, and consequently William's idea.
of a large town was such as would be laughed
at by a much younger child, that had been
accustomed to a wider field of observation. '

Convinced that he had viewed the subject
on all sides, and given it mature deliberation,
the young adventurer set forth one clear moon-
light night, after having crept softly out of the
house, taking with him as large a bundle of his
clot-hes as he thought he could carry, and
eighteen pence in money, all that his step-
mother had allowed him to retain of a present
from the Lady of the Bower when she bade
him goodbye. Full of hope and joyful antici-
pations he travelled across the barren moor he
had so often before traversed, when seeking for
his stray sheep, and frequently strengthening
his resolution by repeating to himself that He
who had said, "Feed my lambs," would not
leave him perish. But forty miles is a long
way for such a child to travel, and he encoun-
tered many difficulties that his inexperience
had never taken into consideration. His small
sum of money was of course soon exhausted,
his feet became swollen and inflamed, and he
was often obliged to lie under hedges for days
together before he could again put them to the
ground. Besides, the season was too early for
wild fruit, so that, when no longer able to do
without food, though often supplied by the
hand of charity, he was also frequently obliged
to part with articles of clothing to relieve his
urgent necessities. In this manner the few
things he had brought with him soon disap-
peared, and those he wore became so much in
tatters that they would scarcely hang together.
Still, however, the noble boy kept a good heart,
and cheered his lonely way with the ballads
with which the Scottish borders abound, and
which his sweet voice enabled him to sing in
no mean strain of melody. But, alas! his
young frame was far from equal to the energy
of his mind, and as he began to draw near his
journey's end, he also began to feel that it
would be impossible for him to go much farther.
As soon as he reached Newcastle, he made his
way with all the speed that his exhausted
strength would allow, to the wharf, and looked
with astonishment and admiration at the forest
of masts which met his View. He had never
before seen a ship, and he felt as if he could
never tire of gazing at those wondrous plough-
ers of the mighty ocean. To be admitted into
one of them, to become acquainted with its
various parts, and to be borne by it to some
of those lands of novelty and wonder on which ,
his young imagination had so often pondered,
was a delight almost too great for conception.
l'he weakness and exhaustion produced by
fatigue and want of food soon impelled him to
apply for admittance into a vessel which was
announced, by a sign fastened to the mast, as
loading for Cadiz. This was far from where he
wished to go, but he could see none bound for
a nearer port, and he flattered himself that if
he could get to Spain he would soon be able to
reach the desired point. He therefore stepped
on board of the vessel, and going up to the man
who appeared highest in authority, profi'ered
his request, but was told they had already too
much lumber such as he on board, and was de-
sired to get out of the way. Thus repulsed, he
returned to the wharf, and began to look
amongst the other vessels for the next most
likely one to take him to the Wished-for haven ;
but in one after another he received the same
or similar answers, till at last fear, for the first
time, taking possession of his young heart, he
stood gazing around him but almost without
a consciousness of where he was, or what was
his aim or object. The evening was beginning
to close in, and the noise of drays and carts had
almost ceased, and poor William began to feel
that he was likely soon to be left alone in this
lately crowded mart, which had a short time
before bewildered him with its bustle and con-
fusion, whilst his exhausted strength almost
led him to believe that his sufferings would be
over before the dawn of another day. He saw
a gentleman coming in the direction where he
stood, and examined his countenance with great
anxiety; and thinking he perceived the marks
of good nature in his open countenance, he de-
termined to speak to him, and crave protection
for the night. Before the gentleman reached
him, however, everything began to swim before
his sight, then a cloud seemed to come over
his eyes, and the next moment all was obli-
Vion.

When William recovered his consciousness,
he found himself stretched on a sofa in a hand
some parlour, for the gentleman that he had
observed approaching, had seen him fall, and
taking him in his arms, had carried him into
his own house, which was near at hand. The'
poor boy looked wildly round, and then as his
recollection returned, he raised his eyes with
an enquiring gaze to the face of the gentleman,
who was standing over him with an expression
of deep concern, whilst a lady, whose gentle
countenance evinced her sympathy, was apply--
ing the usual means for his recovery. A boy
about his own age stood near, watching him
with evident anxiety, and a sweet-looking little
girl, a few years younger, held a tumbler of
water, which, as soon as she saw signs of re-
turning animation, she applied to the poor
boy's mouth. " He is better now, papa, don't-
you think he is '2" she whispered gently. " He
will not die, will he '3"

" N o, my dear, I hope not," replied her
father; and then observing that William's
consciousness had returned, he took his hand,
and in a tone of the utmost gentleness said,
" What was it that made you faint, my little
man?" . . '

In a voice scarcely articulate, William utter-
ed the word "Hunger!"

" Hunger!" repeated the gentleman in sur-
prise; " why, Where do you live? How far
are you from home? You have no appearance
of one in such necessity as to have fainted from.

hunger. Tell me, where is your home, my lit-
tle boy '3"

"I have no home!" replied the child in a - ,.

weak and mournful voice. .The gentleman
paused and eyed the pale, emaciated, but high-
ly interesting object that lay before him, as if
completely at a loss What to make of him. We
have before said that the portion of VVilliam's
clothes that he had been able to retain was

very much torn, but though in a dilapidated
3
state,pthe materials of which they were com-
posed were of such a kind as to indicate the
wearer's belonging to a superior class of society,
for the Lady of the Bower, though she did not
think it right to loosen the ties between father
and son by taking him from his parent, had al-
ways provided his clothing, and having a natu-
ral pleasure in seeing the beautiful boy dressed
in a becoming manner, she had furnished his
wardrobe with no niggard hand. This circum-
cumstance of the superior texture of the arti-
cles of which his dress was composed, as well
as the air of finish visible in the making of
them, so ill accorded with the brief account
he was able to give of himself, that the gentle-
man's benevolence was at fault, and he stood
considering the probabilities of the case till
called to recollection by the voice of his wife.

heart, though she, like her husband, suspected

house from some motive of pet or folly, and
most probably to have plunged a whole family
in anxiety and misery, yet saw that Whatever
ne might have inflicted on others, he was then
a severe sufferer himself, and roused her hus-
band from his reverie by saying, " You forget,
my clear, that whilst trying to satisfy your
curiosity about this poor boy's situation, his
present weakness requires immediate help.
He must have something to give him more
strength, before he is required to answer any
more questions." But scarcely had she uttered
these words, when her little daughter, who the
moment William had pronounced the 'Word
hunger, had'left the room, entered it, bringing
a large plateful of meat, pie, bread and butter,
and every variety of viands she could meet
with in the pantry. Poor William cast a long-
ing look at the food as she approached and
offered it to him; but, laying his hand on her
shoulder her father exclaimed, " Stop, stop,
C/
my child, or you will kill the object of your
benevolence with your kindness. This poor
little boy's stomach is in too relaxed a state to
receive more than a mouthful or two of solid
food at a time; and that must be the lightest
and most easily digested." He then took the
plate from the hands of the child, around
whose neck her mother threw her arm, and
pressed her toward her in expression of fond
approbation, for her promptness in aiding the
sufferer. After receiving a small quantity of
light and nutritive food, which he eagerly
swallowed, whilst his large eyes seemed almost
to devour the very plate itself, he was made
to swallow a few drops of wine and water,
which gradually brought the colour to his
cheek, and gave a little of its wonted anima-
tion to his almost lifeless countenance. " Now,
my little boy," said the gentleman, after not-ic-
ing with pleasure these signs of returning
strength, and feeling as he viewed the interest-
ing and beautiful object of his benevolence,
the deepest sympathy for the supposed friends
whom he had forsaken, " you are strong enough
now to answer a few questions, and I want
you to tell me where your relations are, that
I may give them notice of your safety."

"I have no relations that care for me," re-
plied William, the large tears starting to his
eyes as he spoke; " I have only one friend in
the world, and she is so far off, that I am afraid
it will be hard for me to get to her."

" Have you been seeking for her '2" asked
his benevolent friend.

" Yes, sir, I have walked all the way from
Alaston Moor, to try to get a ship to take me
to Lisbon to her."

" From Alaston Moor!" exclaimed the gen-
tleman with surprise. " Why, my little fellow,
that is my native place. What is your father's
name, for there can be little doubt that I know
him." The tears that had before trembled in
William's eyes now began to flow rapidly down
his cheeks, as he spoke of the sad accident
that had deprived him of his only remaining
parent, (whom his host remembered perfectly,)
and of the unhappy home that he had had
from the time of his father's death.

"And who is the friend that you expect to
find in Lisbon?" asked Mr. Carville; for it is
now full time we should give a name to one
so well worthy of distinction.

"The Lady of the Bower," answered W'il-
liam with animation. " She has clothed and
educated me for more than three years past,
and she promised me that if she did not return
to the Bower, I should go to her. If I could
but 'get to Lisbon, I should be happy, for she
is the best and kindest of friends."

Mr. Carville made no reply, but a deep sigh
escaped his bosom, whilst his little girl whis-
pered, "Wasn't it her death that you read
about in the paper last night, papa '3" Her
father gave her a nod of assent, but motioned
to her not to speak of it again, for he was
afraid, in William's weak state, of the shock
it would be to him to hear of the loss of his
noble benefactress.

Having received small but frequent supplies
of food, William soon became strong enough
to sit up, and when able to balance himself
once more upon his feet, Mrs. Carville suggest-
ed his having the refreshment of a good wash-
ing, on which her son, who had hitherto stood
by a silent but sympathising observer of all
that passed, proposed taking him to his room,
and supplying him with a change of clothes,
to which his father and mother both readily
assented. William's simple narrative, and the
unequivocal marks of feeling that had accom-
panied it, had succeeded in gaining their entire
confidence, and Mr. Carville, who felt that he
had been thrown by Providence into his hands,
to supply the place of ' the patroness he had
lost, determined at once that the appeal to his
humanity should not be made in vain.
When our little hero again appeared in the
parlour, it would be difficult to say which of
the family seemed most delighted with their
new guest, for though fatigue and want of food
had made considerable encroachments on his
strength, he had been too much accustomed to
hardships to let them weigh heavily on his
mind, and his bright intelligent countenance
beamed with joy and thankfulness. A few
days, with good food and kind treatment,
served to restore our little hero's exhausted
frame, and as his bodily powers revived, his
active disposition recovered its wonted energy,
and he eagerly gratified his inquiring mind,
by an examination of the town, which ap-
peared to his inexperienced judgment, of mar-
vellous extent and magnificence. But even
the view of so many new and wonderful sights,
failei to withdraw his thoughts from the great{7}

object of his journey, and he made frequent
inquiries of his kind host, about the most like-
ly means of getting to Lisbon. At length,
when satisfied he was strong enough to bear
the shock, that gentleman told him in the
kindest and tenderest manner, that the symp-
toms of consumption which had alarmed her
physicians before she left the Bower, had in-
creased so rapidly, notwithstanding her remov~
al to a milder climate, that his patroness had
expired suddenly, a few days before the vessel,
in which she was returning home, had reached
its destined port, and that her remains had
been taken to her native p1ace,to be deposited
in the family vault. "Then if I had stayed
at home," exclaimed the sobbing boy, "I
might at least have seen her eoflin ; perhaps

, I might even see it now, if I were to go back

again. Alarmed lest he should seriously
think of putting such an idea into execution,
Mr. Carville took every pains to impress upon
his mind that it was his duty in everything to
prove his gratitude to his patroness, and that
he could only do this by making it his con-
stant study to be a good and useful man, and
by acting at all times in such a manner as he
felt that she would approve of, were she by his
side. "And remember, my good boy," he
continued, "that though you are separated
from her for a time, you will soon meet her
again; and only think how much you will
add to her happiness, as well as serving your
own, by proving that she was the means of
bringing one more sheep to the fold of the
Saviour."

The loss of his pstroness cast a dark cloud
for a considerable time over the mind of our
hero; but Mr. Carville, who soon discovered
his thirst for seeing. foreign parts, proposed
his going, a cabin-boy, in a vessel of his own
which was about to sail for Boston; and Wil-
liam's mind was gradually drawn from the
contemplation of his misfortune by the idea
that his longing desire to see far-distant re-
gions was about to be gratified. Herman and
Julia Carville would gladly have persuaded
their father to keep him with them, till he was
a year or two older; but though as much dise
posed to admire and love the boy as them:
selves, he felt that he would not be acting the
part of a friend to him, by keeping him in
idleness. Nor were their wishes at all second-
ed by William's own, for though grateful f01
their kindness, and returning their love with
all the warmth of his ardent spirit, he panted
to be in activity, and in the way of learning
to provide for himself. Mr. Carville recom',
mended him to the especial care and kindness if
of the captain, who, he assured William, he
knew to be an amiable and had-hearted man;
and full of gratitude to his friends for the
affectionate attention he received, and buoyant
with hope, our young adventurer set sail for
those distant regions of which he had often
dreamt, but never hoped to see. Even his
passage down the Tyne, though it is only such
a stream as in this country would hardly be
thought deserving the name of river, was to
our young and inexperienced traveller, an
object of surprise and interest, in consequence
of the numerous vessels that were passing and
repassing on its waters; but when launched
on the mighty ocean, nothing could exceed his
wonder and admiration, till an overpowering
sea-sickness overcame every other feeling, and
made him for three or four days unable to
raise his head from the deck, where he lay
.prostrate and almost lifeless. This penalty,
however, upon the inexperienced sailor, at
length subsided, and William was again able
to look around, and admire and marvel at the
wonderful works of creation. The only pas-
sengers in the vessel were a Mr. Harper and
family, consisting of his wife and two daugh-
lers, the one a year older and the other as
much younger, than our little cabin-boy.
Whilst the vessel was yet in the river, William
had gained the good opinion of this gentleman
by a circumstance, to which the boy himself
had attached little importance. Mr. Harper
had given him a pair of trousers, to beat and-
brush for him, and whilst doing so, William
heard something fall on the deck that sounded
like money, and looking carefully around, he
found it to be a sovereign. The boy was per-
fectly alone at the time, and could as easily
have retained the piece of money as not, but
though he was acquainted with its value, and
was himself entirely void of every species of
coin, the idea of appropriating it never once
entered his head. As soon therefore as he had
finished brushing the trousers, he took them
to their owner, and holding out the. piece of
money at the same time, said, with as much
simplicity as if it were a matter of course,

. -_,
A._,.n....._i 4......ummmm
"And here is a sovereign, sir, that fell out of
one of the pockets."

"Indeed!" said Mr. Harper with surprise;
" I was not aware that I had left any money
in the pockets, and deserve. to suffer for my
carelessness, Whilst you have a right- to a re-
ward, my little fellow, for your honesty. We
will therefore share this sovereign between
us 3" and so saying, he counted out ten shil-
lings, and held them out to William.

"No sir, thank you," said our hero; "I
have no right to the money; it is n't mine."

" But you could easily have kept the whole
of it, if you had chosen."

" There is not much merit in not choosing
to be a thief," returned William, with an air
of dignity that astonished his companion, and
led him to question him more minutely than
he had hitherto done, respecting his history.
The simple but interesting little narrative

that the boy then gave, excited feelings of the
warmest nature in the whole family, for they
all happened to be assembled together at the
time; and William, who had before gained
their good opinion by his beauty and pleasing
manners, now became an object of heartfelt
esteem and admiration. From that time Mrs.
Harper, who had before studiously guarded
her daughters from any familiarity with the
crew, was perfectly willing for them to con-
verse with the little cabin-boy, Whenever he
was at leisure, and was always glad, when
William was at liberty, to take a share in the
information that, from time to time, their
father imparted to his children concerning the
natural objects by which they were surround-
ed. We wish exceedingly, that our limits
would permit us to impart some of those won-
derful and highly interesting truths to our
young readers; but as that is not the case, we
rejoice to think that there are so many exceL
lent works on natural history new current,
that all who have a wish for it may easily
become acquainted with them; and a study
more calculated to enlarge the mind and im-
prove the heart, they certainly could not well
pursue. In the hope, therefore, that a study
of the works of nature will become as general
as it is useful and amusing, we will continue
our narrative of the little sailor.

Amongst the crew was a boy who appeared
to be about sixteen years of age, that was the
butt of the whole ship's company. He was
a tall, large-boned, and awkward fellow, with
large nose, wide mouth, and sandy complexion.
The only expression Visible in his countenance
was a degree of good-nature amounting almost
to imbecility, and it was difficult to tell whe-
ther the quietness with which he bore the
gibes and jeers of his companions, arose from
not caring for, or not understanding them.
That the latter, however, was not altogether
the case, might be inferred from a sort of dog-
god obstinacy that he would occasionally evince
when imposed upon by orders that he did not
think he had any right to obey. This not
unfrequently occurred when commanded by
the mate, a dark, morose, and tyrannical man,
who was only rendered tolerable by the awe
in which he stood of the captain. It is scarce-
ly necessary to say that William never took
any part in plaguing poor Anty, as he was
called, but on the contrary, though several -
years his junior, he assumed that power which
a strong mind always has over a weak one,
and persuaded the boy to treat their scofi's and
impositions with indifference, at the same time
that he acted the part of a protector, and fre-
quently warded ofi' the intended insults. The
consequence was, that Anty evinced the most
devoted attachment to our hero, and on many
occasions, with the kind captain's approbation,
he did his work for him, and left him at liber-

ty to listen to Mr. Harper's conversation, and
4
gain an increase of that knowledge for which
his soul so ardently panted.

But poor William seemed destined to be the
butt of adverse circumstances. They had
only been nine days at sea when the worthy
captain began to sicken, and soon discovered
signs of an alarming fever. From the first
of his being seized, he seemed to be aware
what was the matter with him. He had, only
an hour or two before he sailed, visited a par-
ticular friend, who was lying on the point of
death with the small-pox. He had, imme
diately on coming away, used every precaution
that prudence could suggest to avoid taking
the dangerous infection; but, notwithstanding
all his care, he was convinced he was now
about to become a victim to the same frightful
scourge of humanity. He, therefore, from the
first would scarcely allow any one to come
near him, and, indeed, all seemed equally

disorder. William alone, who declared that
the Lady of the Bower had taken care to have
him properly vaccinated, resisted all opposi-
tion, and persevered in his attentions to the
captain until death closed the scene, when he
had the pain of seeing this kind, benevolent
friend committed to the deep.

This melancholy circumstance, besides de-
priving the boy of an excellent master, had
a most distressing effect in other respects; for
the mate, who in every particular was the
opposite of his deceased captain, now of course
became master of the vessel, and lost no time
in exercising his authority over those who had
not the power of resistance. William, who
had good sense enough to know that obedience
and submission was not only a duty, but the
best policy, both acted up to the principle him-
self and encouraged Anty to do the same. But
it was not easy to enlighten that poor boy's

weaker judgment. His hatred of the mate, -
who had so often and so cruelly tyrannised
over him, was inveterate, and his course of
conduct in consequence was little short of
rebellion.

One day, he who was now captain had exer-
cised his authority in various ways, in the
most wanton and unauthorised manner, till he
had goaded and irritated the boy into a fit of
the most unyielding stubbornness, and then,
as if aware of the effect it would produce, he
ordered him to go and wash the fore-deck over
again, which the boy had finished only a few
minutes before. The command, as he doubt-
less anticipated, was not obeyed, and, on being
asked if he did not intend to do as he was bid,
Ant-y gave a brief ' No.' Immediately two of
the men were ordered to strip off his jacket
and shirt, and tie him to one of the masts,
whilst the captain, seizing a lash, prepared to
exercise it on the bare skin of the culprit. At
this moment William, who had been perform
ing some of his duties in the cabin, came on
deck, and seeing in an instant what was going
forward, began to plead, with all the eloquence
of a feeling and affectionate heart, for the con-
demned criminal. " Oh, pray forgive him this
time," he exclaimed with energy, " and I am
sure he will soon acknowledge himself sorry
for what he has done, and will be good and
obedient for the future."

" Keep off with you, and let me have none
of your whining noise," said the brutal man;
"lest I should give you a taste of the same
medicine over your own back."

" Well, let me have it then," cried the gene-
rous boy. " It will not be so hard to bear it
myself, as to see him suffer. Or tell me to do
anything however difficult, and I will do it, if
you will- only let him go Without his punish-
ment."

" Well, then, go up to the top-gallant mast
and stay there two hours, and your bright
favourite shall go free," said the captain, with
a brutal laugh.

Our hero did not stop a moment to reply,
but springing to the ladder began immediately
to ascend, and as his small hands seized the
ropes, and with one foot on the first step, he
stood for an instant looking around, his beau-
tiful countenance beaming with pleasure, he
presented a picture that any painter might be
glad to copy.

All eyes were eagerly fixed upon the adven-
turous youth as he ascended, for it was the
first time he had ever been allowed to mount
so high. There was besides a heavy undeiu
' swell in the sea, (as is well known to those
who have ever been on the ocean sometimes
to occur, even though the wind is perfectly
calm,) so that even the most experienced
seamen found it difficult to balance them-
selves

At length he was seen to reach the top, and
on " the high and giddy mast," is preparing to "

seat himself, when a sudden swell threw the
vessel on her side with such a swing, that
either William's feeble force was unequal to

contend against it, or his brain turned dizzy, '

or perhaps both these things combined, for he
lost his hold, and the next moment he was
seen to drop into the ocean, to which the al-
most horizontal mast had already borne him
very near.

With the rapidity almost of lightning, Anty,
who was now released from his bondage,
jumped over the ship's side, and being a good
swimmer, made his way with great speed to
the place where William had fallen. But an
under-tow kept drawing the powerless boy
more rapidly away than Anty was able to
pursue, so that the boat that was launched had
almost overtaken him, before he could seize the

object of his solicitude, now a lifeless weight, '
and hold. his head above the water; They

were all saon once more on the deck, on which
our hero was laid cold and inanimate. -

" He is done now, with all his heroism," said
the captain, looking at the lifeless boy, and
uttering such a laugh as the hyena gives when
rejoicing over its prey.

Anty, who stood with the water pouring
from his rough and tangled hair, and stream-
ing down his bare back, cast a look first on
William's inanimate form, as it lay extended
at his feet, and then at the savage man, which
seemed to say, the hyena itself would not have
more delight in tearing him to pieces than he
would experience, if such retribution were in
his power.

The whole transaction had been of too ex-
citing, too agonizing a nature, for any one to
think of giving vent to exclamations. The
inmates of the cabin, therefore, were wholly
unconscious of any thing extraordinary hav<<
ing been going forward, till the two young
Harpers happening to come on the deck, be-
held the drenched and lifeless body of their
favourite, stretched near the companion-door,
and Anty standing by his side, with his arms
folded and his countenance wearing an expres-
sion of the deepest agony and despair. Their
loud cries soon brought their parents up to
inquire the cause. The scene which presented
itself, soon told its own tale. " Have no efforts
been'made to revive him?" cried Mr. Harper,
with a benevolent impetuosity, as he raised
the cold and beautiful form of his little far
vourite.

" It would be lost labour," replied the un-
feeling captain; "he is only fit food for the
shark that he has been watching so constantly
for the last two or three days."

" All must be done, however, that is possi-
ole," returned the passenger; "so noble a. na-
ture must not be permitted to leave us so soon
if we can help it." '
So saying, he took the inanimate body in
his arms, and carried it down to the cabin,
followed by his amiable wife and children,
whilst the almost equally lifeless Ant-y follow-
ed in the rear. Every means that could be
devised were made use of to recall the pure
spirit to its lovely mansion. For a long time
their efforts seemed unavailing, but at length
signs of life began to appear, when Mr. Har-
per was obliged to send both Anty and his
children away, lest- their clamorous rejoicing
should counteract the efforts he and his wife
were making.

" You consigned this boy to the shark," said
Mr. Harper to the captain, a few days after
William's recovery, " and I rescued him from
its jaws. I think, therefore, that I am now
entitled to claim him as my property. I have
no son of my own, so he will supply the defi-
ciency, and I will write to your owner, to ex-
plain the whole business."
" But must Anty be left behind, sir?" asked
William, distressed at the idea of the poor
boy being still in the power of the tyrant.

" I understand he is not an indentured ser-
vant, and therefore if he choose to leave the
vessel he may, and I will employ him in my
factory," replied the gentleman, well pleased
to see William's sympathy for the uncouth
boy.

It is scarcely necessary to say that Anty
was delighted with the proposal, and the sav-
age captain, who now began to be afraid of
the kind of report that was likely to be sent
home to his owner, made no objection to the
arrangement, but tried to pass off the whole
transaction, by which our hero so nearly lost
his life, as a mere joke. Mr. Harper heard
what he said without making any reply, but
determined as he did so, that a faithful report
of his brutal behaviour should be transmitted
to Mr. Carville, and he hoped that as far, at
least, as that gentleman's power extended, the
unfeeling tyrant would never have another
opportunity of exercising his malicious dispo-
sitions over the weak and helpless.

Very soon after his arrival in Boston, Mr.
Harper placed his young protege in one of
those seminaries of education for which that
city is distinguished, where William applied
himself with his usual ardour and industry to
the business of self-improvement.

"It is almost a pity," said his patron one
day, when his young favourite returned home
laden with school honours, "to bestow such
an education on a mere sailor; I hope, my
boy, that as your knowledge increases, your
ambition will also rise above such a call-
ing."

" It has already risen above that of a mere
sailor, sir," answered William, with modest
and graceful dignity; "for I am anxious to
do credit to the many generous patrons that
have one after another come to my aid in my
necessities; and I don't know any calling that
is more likely to put that in my power than .
the one I have chosen. You have often told
me that some of the most distinguished men
in the country were, when children, actual
foundlings, and you know, sir, Columbus him-
self was at first only a poor sailor boy."

Many years have elapsed since the incidents
(many of which are taken from real life) oc-
curred, and we are persuaded it will be grati;
fying to our young readers to hear that the
flattering promises which William's early years
presented, were all confirmed and strengthened
as he advanced in age, and that he gradually
became a very useful and distinguished mem-
ber of society. Among those who exulted in
having been instrumental in bringing forth so '
noble a character, was his early patron, Mr.
Carville. The profession which our hero had
chosen gave him frequent opportunities of see-
ing and cultivating the friendship of that gen-
tleman and his amiable family; and when
recording, with justifiable pride, his first_intro-
duction to the interesting boy, Mr. Carville
never failed to remark that this bright star,
which shone so conspicuously in both hemi-
spheres, first rose on the bleak and barren
waste of his own native Alaston Moor. Nor
did he ever fail to draw an important moral
from the circumstances as he exultingly related
them. With all the energy of a warm and
glowing heart he called upon his hearers to
consider, that the fact of a young boy totally
destitute of every adventitious recommendap
tion, having become so distinguished, offered
a strong inducement to those who had it in
their power to aid the weak and friendless, to
do so with their utmost might, whilst those
who required such aid would naturally draw
encouragement from William's success " to go
and do likewise." Industry and virtue can
scarcely fail to make their way in any coun-
try; but in this free and prosperousmne, the
impediments are fewer and less formidable;
and the road is open to all, however low their

commencement, who seek to gain the esteem ,

and confidence of their fellow-beings by such
means as those which distinguished The Young
Sailor.
