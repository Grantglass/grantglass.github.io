published many works, of which

Robinson Crusoe is the chief. It is
said that he derived the idea of this

story from the narrative of Alexander

on the island of Juan Fernandez, and

was brought away by Captain Rogers,

and restless disposition.THE ADVENTURES on
ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

Roamsos Cnusor; according to his
own account of himself, was, at the
age of eighteen, a discontented and
most unreasonable young gentleman.
He had kind parents, a comfortable
home, and all the advantages com-
monly arising from prOSperous cir-
cumstances; and yet he was dissatis-
fied. He appeared to be weary of
good things, and to desire evil things
for the sake of the change. You will
see that he had more than enough of
amazing troubles and disasters, in the
course of his life, to teach him the
value of common comforts at home.

things convenient about him; his
sister has hold of his hand, and is
endeavouring by kindness to persuade
him into a good humour, whilst his
parents are representing the advantages
he there possessed, and are pointing
to the case of a poor beggar at the
door, to whom a servant has been
sent with relief; but who, in the mean
time, endures the pitiless wintry storm,
and hunger at the same time. Robin-
son, however, disregards all that can
be said and done to attach him to his
home; he becomes ill-tempered and
reserved; and, would you believe it, he
forms the sad resolution of leaving his
parents' house without their leave or
knowledge. I quite expect to find him
in some dreadful situation of distress
the next time we hear of him--let us
see.l2 nosmson causal.

wind has just blown his hat off, do
not you see? Before I tell you what
became of him this time, I must ex.
plain how he came on board that ship,
and where it was to have sailed. The
case was this. Robinson had stated
his discontents to some of his young
acquaintances, amongst whom was a.
sailonlad, whose father owned a vessel
trading from Hull, in Yorkshire, to
London. This lad told Crusoe that
he would be happy directly if he
would but go to sea--a very great
mistake, indeed, which many a boy
finds out too late. However, Robinsonl3

disliked home and regular habits so
much, that he took this bad advice---
ran away from his dear parents and
brothers and sisters without even say-
ing Good bye, and got on board this
vessel one fine autumn evening, in
Company with his sailor-friend. I am
afraid that neither of these lads told
the captain of the vessel the truth,
or he would not have taken them;
but so it was: they sailed out of the
river Humber, and very delightful it
seemed at first; but, in a few hours,

to have been sold in London for
thousands of pounds, and all the ship,

them had no time to think of those
things, for they were afraid, every
moment. that their little boat, with
themselves in it, would also go down,

if he had pleased. He had some
thoughts of doing so; but unhappily,
he felt more ashamed of seeing his
friends again, and confessing his fault,
than of continuing to be a disobedient
runaway lad. So he proceeded to
London, where it appears some rely
none of his were then living. "
Roswsorz CRUSOE does not tell us
much of his visit to London, but that
he was still bent on going abroad, and
in fact obtained money of some of his
relations for that purpose. Perhaps
they thought it better that he should
go, unsettled and contrary as his dis-
position was, than be forced back
again to make his parents miserable by
his ithumour. So, after spending
some time in London, young Crusoe
embarked in a trading vessel, bound
for Guinea, on the coast of Africa,

Robinson says, that this was the
only successful voyage he ever made.
He gained about PS300 in money, and
some knowledge of navigation into the
bargain. He again returned to Lon-
don; but, strange to tell, did not visit
his parents at York, nor take any no-
tice of his other relations.

trading vessel, and soon set out again
to try his fortunes. They were mis-
fortunes indeed this time; for his
vessel was taken by Moorish pirates;
that is, sea robbers from Morocco, and
he and all the crew were made pri-
soners--that is, slaves. See now
Robinson Crusoe reduced from pros-
perity to slavery ---- from the condition
of a gentleman's son, or a merchant
on his own account, to that of a toiling

drudge in the house and garden of an
African robber!

Crusoe's master sometimes employed
him in fishing excursions; and on one
of these occasions, when there was
nobody but himself; one man and a25

boy on board, Robinson began to
entertain the thought of making his
escape; so, knowing that this man -
could swim perfectly well, and that
they were no great distance from shore,
Robinson shoved him suddenly over-
board, and putting out to sea with a
fair wind, soon got out of sight of
land. He easily. persuaded the boy,
named Xury, to become his servant,
and help him all he could. And so
they remained a long time beating
about in the Mediterranean, and not
knowing whereabouts they were, nor
indeed to which place it would be but
to go.
As our friend Robinson Crusoe had
not fixed in his own mind on any
particular place to steer to, being
chiefly anxious to keep out of the way
of his African master, he was not
sorry to keep out at sea, till he thought
there was no fear of his being pursued.
Nor was he sorry at length to come
in sight of land, for he and the boy
were dreadfully distressed with thirst,
having no more water on board.
The shore they came to he never
knew the name of. They heard the
voices of many strange wild beasts at
a distance in the woods, which alarmed
them exceedingly; however, they

say; I should think that it was served-
up without seasoning, sauce, or cur-
rant jelly!

Whilst they were prowling about
on this wild shore, they came unex-
pectedly on a most terrific sight indeed;
-it was a very great lion, fast asleep!
Happily, Robinson had his gun with
him, with which he shot the lion.
They then went up to him, took off
his skin, and with this returned again -
to their boat.
I surross that our two wanderers
must have sailed through the Straits '
of Gibraltar without knowing it, for
the next we hear of them is, that
they were steering southward in the
Atlantic Ocean, hoping to meet with
some European ship. If Robinson
could have found a conveyance, then,
safely to his father's house at York,
how glad he would have been!

They continued out at sea some
time longer, and being much in want
of food, they approached a shore, and
saw some wild black people, of whom
they obtained some supplies, but who
seemed very much astonished, and not
a little frightened at their unexpected
guests, who did not wish to trouble
them long with their company, and33

therefore soon sought and regained
their little vessel. Whilst they were
driving before the wind, in much
anxiety as to their fate, Xury sud-
denly cried out, "0! master, a ship--

a ship 2" They were both overjoyed
at the sight, which was evidently a

European vessel; and now their chief
effort was to make themselves per-
ceived; for the vessel, though in
sight, was not sailing towards them.
So they hoisted a white flag ashigh
as they could, and at length had the
joy of seeing that they were observed,
as the vessel now altered her course,
and came towards them.

WHEN the ship came up to our
adventurers, the captain inquired of
Robinson, in three different languages,
who and what he was; but unhappily,
this young man, not having improved
his time at school, understood not a.
word he said in French, in Spanish,
or in Portuguese. At last, a Scotch
sailor, who chanced to be on board,
found that Robinson was an English-
man, and so got the needful informa-
tion out of him; which, when the
captain understood, induced him to
take the two young men on board,
with all their goods.

The Portuguese captain behaved
very well indeed to his new guests,
and offered to take them where he
was going, that was to the Brazils, in37

South America, and to buy his boat
at a fair price of him when he got
there. He also offered to take the
boy Xury, and employ him in his
ship, which was a great benefit to
both.

They had a prosperous voyage to
the Brazils. The captain, who was
generous as well as just, refused to
take anything of Robinson for his pas-
sage; and, at the same time, bought all

the boat, and all that was in it, with
the lion's skin, produced him thus a
very useful sum of money; the thing
above all things needful in arriving on
a foreign shore.40 nosmsox onuson.

And now we find Robinson Crusoe
in quite a new situation and condition
in life. Being recommended by the
captain to an honest resident, who was
master of a sugar plantation, he ac-
quainted himself with the manner of
cultivating that plant, and of making
the sugar itself. At length he pur-
chased some land, and set up planter.

But Robinson began now to reflect
that he could have done better than
this at home, had he liked to have
settled on a farm, or to any other pro-
fession or business. In fact, though
he was succeeding as well as he could
expect, he began to be unhappy and
discontented again. At length, when
he had been about four years in the

Brazils, and had considerably increased41

his property, Robinson Crusoe deter-
mined to sell all off, and go to sea
again as a merchant; and what trade
do you think he fixed upon now to
carry forward on the seas ?--the slave
trade! I am sorry to say that he
resolved to sail to the coast of Africa,
to purchase poor negroes to work in
the plantations of Brazil.44 Bonuses causor.

Bur our restless adventurer was

content, and for his unjust purpose of

of their knowledge; so that, for twelve
days they knew not where they were,
nor whither they were going. Whilst
they were in this perplexity and terror,
one of the sailors suddenly called out

see land; but Robinson had no sooner
run out of the cabin to look out, than
the vessel struck upon a sand-bank;
and the motion being thus stopped,
the sea broke over with tremendous
violence. threatening every instant to
wash them all overboard, and to break
the ship in pieces. At last, they did
as before, and as is usual in such cases,
they got the boat down and embarked
in her, although they had little hope
that they could thereby escape. At .
length, their worst fears were realised;

the fatal wave came which overeat
their boat, and threw them all into the

stormy sea!
You would now expect an end of
the story, but that you know if they
had all been drowned, no one could
have told about the storm. Yes, one
was saved, and he got to shore without
any boat at all. It was Robinson,
himself, who was thrown out like the
rest of them; but so it happened that
the wave which upset the boat bore
him on its foaming edge, and at length
hurled him with violence on the shore.
He had just time to get on his legs,
and run higher up, before the next
wave came, which would have carried
him back again to the whelming
ocean. Poor Crusoe had scarcely
escaped this danger, when he dropped
nearly imensible from the violence,
exertion. and fright. he had undergone.49
When he came to himself, he looked
up, and thanked God for his wonderful

deliverance. He was the only one
saved out of the whole company; he
never saw them afterwards, nor any
sign of them, but three of their hats,
one cap, and two shoes that were not
fellows.

Robinson cast his eyes to the
stranded vessel, which lay at some
distance, buffeted by the yet rolling
sea. It seemed to him a miracle that
he could have got on shore.

So our friend Robinson Crusoe is
at length landed all alone on an en-
tirely unknown shore! What was to
become of him now--what should he
do? Can you tell me what you
would do in such a case--hunger
coming on, night approaching, and no
food or lodgin'r provided! I rather
think you would wish yourselt at
home again, as there is no doubt
Robinson did on that occasion. In
fact, he soon began to think that he
had but a dreadful deliverance from
a sudden to a lingering death. His
condition was indeed pitiable. He
was wet, and had no other clothes, nor
anything to eat and drink, nor any
prospect but that of perishing with
famine, or being devoured by wild53ROBINSON 03030:. 55

beasts. He had no weapon to defend
him, or to enable him to procure any
animal for his sustenance; he had
nothing about him but a knife, and a
tobacco-box and pipe, with a little
tobacco. He walked about in very
great distress and agony of mind, and
as night came on, he had nothing for
it but to climb up into a thick bushy
tree, out of the way of wild beasts, and
here he fell fast asleep.56 nonmsox envsoz.

THE next morning, early, Robinson
awoke in his leafy chamber, and
rubbing his eyes, wondered not a little
where he was. Hunger soon reminded
him that he had had no supper, and
when he had roused himself completely,
he could not tell where his breakfast
was to come from. This was rather a
serious predicament--worse than sit-
ting by his father's fireside at York,
taking rolls and coffee on a rainy
morning.

Before Crusoe descended from the
tree, he looked out on the ocean. The
storm had abated, and he was sur.
prised to observe that the wreck of
the ship had been thrown higher up,
and much nearer the shore. This
gave him some comfort, and he walked57

as far as he could towards her, but still
found half a mile of water between the
vessel and the land. In a few hours,

however, the tide had ebbcd out so far
that he could approach the ship by
swimming; and, after having paddled
round it for some time, he at length
found a bit of rope hanging from her
side, by which he swung himself up,
and got on board. Now, be perceived
that if they had all kept the ship, that
they would all have been safe, and he

would have had companions in his
exile.
WHEN Robinson got on board the
vessel, it was a sad sight indeed. She
was wedged fast, so that the fore part
was secured and whole, but the hind
part was greatly damaged and broken,
and she was more than half filled with
water. All the masts, sails, and ropes
--which are called the rigging--
were gone. Happily, however, for
Robinson, he found the provisiomroom
but little injured, and the chiefof' the
stores remaining good. 0 with what
a relish did he devour biscuits and
bacon, cheese, and saltJish, and how
refreshed he was by a drop of good
wine from the neck of a broken bottle,
though in his eagerness he sadly cut
his mouth with the glass! He found,
indeed, that he was in danger of in.61

dulging to excess after his long fast,
and therefore presently set about
another kind of employment. He
knew that his very existence depended
on his being able to transport these
provisions to the shore, for his future
subsistence; but how was this to be
done? there was no boat, and the
remains of the vessel would not hold
together long, strained as it still was
by the force of the sea and wind. Ho
Could, to be sure, swim away as he had
done, and he could put a biscuit or two
in his mouth; but it was needful to

hit on some better contrivance than "'5"

that--what do You think it could be ?

Do you knew what a raft is? It

fastened together, and which will
be sure to float, because any single
piece would float by itself. Now it
is plain, that if a raft thus made he
put on the water, and not overloaded,
it will answer, in some degree, the
purpose of a boat; and if a man can
but keep his place and position upon
it, he may proceed with it in safety.
So Robinson set to work; and, finding
plenty of broken timber and scattered
rigging about, he corded a quantity
together as flat as a floor; and, having
tied to it a rope of sufiicient length to
prevent its sailing away, he contrived,
by the help of lines, and with great
exertion, to heave it over the ship'sMakes a Raft.

side. There was a splash ! So--now
the raft has adjusted itself, and lies
pretty flat on the water, but bobbing up
and down with the waves. But Crusoe
soon steadied it a little with some. of
the seamen's heavy chests, and with
casks of provisions, and other things.
Whilst hewas doing this, the tide was -
rising, and he had the unhappiness to
see his coat and waistcoat, which he
had left on shore, washed away by the
sea. However, he found others on
board the ship; and, having got as
much on his raft, of provisions, uten-
- .8118,- tools, arms, and ammunition, as
It could' well sustain, he pushed off;
and the sea being tolerably quiet, 'he
. managed to row himself to land. Look
at him in the print; there he is, fit)",

E
Ronmsos did not get to land without
hazard and difficulty; for when his
raft touched the ground, the opposite
part began to sink 1n the water, so that
he and his wares were very nearly
sloped 03' into the sea. He just suc-
ceeded 1n preventing this, and at length
got all his goods up high and dry on
the shore. Oh, how thankful he was!
--there was food enough, and other
comfortable things for along time to
' come--no thoughts of starving now.

His next care was to find a place
of lodging for himself, and of security
for his goods. So, having piled them
together as well as he could, he took

it was that he discovered this strangeAscends a Hill.

spot to be an island, for he could see
the ocean with its waves sparkling all
round it. The island itself was of
course not very large, nor was it barren;
there were woods and grassy vales, and
various animals skipping about, but
he could not discover the least sign of
a human being. You see him there,
on the top of the hill, in the engraving,
and there are his casks and chests in
a heap below.. What has he done with
his raft? Oh! there it is, tied to a
stump driven into the sand!72 3031113011 causal.

Roamsos Cnuson came down from
the hill, and walked about to explore
the island further, but was greatly
afraid of losing sight of his stores.
So he did not go a great way that day;
but when evening arrived, he felt very
much fatigued with his exertions, and
began to wish much for some quiet
lodging, in which he might lie secure
for the night. However, he could
find none then, and therefore he
barricaded himself round as well as
he could with the tubs, chests, and
boards; and having taken his supper,
passed the night pretty comfortably.
In the morning, he again looked towards
the ship, and finding she still re-
mained, he determined to try and raft
over as many mere things as he thought73
would be useful to him; and, in fact,
went and came on this errand several
times, and greatly increased his stores
on the island. It was not to be ex-
pected that he should do this every
time without an accident: on one 00.
casion, the rat}, and all that was on it,
was upset and washed away, and
himself narrowly escaped drowning.
These expeditions were at length put
an end to as he had expected. One
morning, when he awoke, after a windy
night, and looked towards the sea, the

ship had entirely disappeared; not a
plank was visible; all had been borne
away by the curling green waves!
ROBINSON Cnusos, though solitary,
was no longer destitute on his little
island. Provisions, drink, clothing,
tools, materials, arms, gunpowder, and
shot, with innumerable other articles,
not excepting MONEY! he had supplied
himself with in more or less abun-
dance. You will ask, of what use
money could be to him in an unin-
habited island? None whatever, cer.
tainly; but he prudently thought that
if ever a ship came that way, gold
would be of use again.

Still Robinson was without a habio
tation. He had goods, but no lodging,
and that was rather awkward; he was
also in constant terror of wild beasts
issuing from the woods, which might
eat his provisions, and perhaps himself77

should do, and resolved 'to erect him.
self a tent with the sails and cordage
of the ship, until he could provide
himself some more secure habitation.

He found that he should soon lose
all knowledge of the days, months, or
years of his present life, unless he kept
some account of their progress; so he
got some long sticks, and cutting a
notch every day, could at an tune
count them up, and find where e was
in the year.80 11031sz causes.

Rosmson's tent would not have
protected him from the attacks of wild
beasts, of which he was so much
afraid, if he had trusted to ropes and
canvass. To fortify himself to his
satisfaction, he enclosed it in a ring
fence, made with stakes driven firmly
into the ground, and so high as not
to be mounted by men or animals.
He would not even make a door for
himself to enter, lest he should chance
to leave it open, but used a ladder,
which he always drew up after him.
So he was secure, and at the same
time solitary indeed. Within this
enclosure, or within his tent, he
brought all his various stores and
useful articles. This spot was close
under the side of a hill, in which he
scooped out a cave, which he made
his cellar.81

Now, though this young man was
for the present in much less distress
than might have been expected, he
was by no means happy. The thoughts
of his native land, and the social
comforts he had forsaken without
cause, often brought tears into his eyes;
and his utter loneliness made him,
for the most part, melancholy and
wretched. If he had not been obliged
to employ himself so much in labo-
rious occupations required by his situ-
ation, he might have lost his reason
altogether. I trust, therefore, that
none of my young readers will envy
him, however snug was his tent and
cave, and although he was a sort of
monarch over the island he inhabited.

92
11' was, according to Robinson's
reckoning, the 30th of September,
1659, when he first set foot on this
island. At that period, mariners had
traversed the seas but little, and there
were countless lands and seas which
had never apparently been visited by
men. It would now be rather difficult
to find a solitary island, or even the
rocky summit of a mountain above
the sea, which has not been seen,
named, and laid down in some chart
or another.

Our adventurer did not neglect to
provide himself with pen, ink, and
paper, books, and nautical instruments,
out of the ship's stores; and these
relieved his dulness very much, and
enabled him to write his history at85

full length. What he says in his
narrative about this island as an um
known country to all the world, might
have been true almost two hundred
years ago; but this would not quite
do to write as existing to the pre'Sent
day. The print shows Robinson in
. his tent, writing his history by the
_ light of a lamp.
As this is but a little book, and
Robinson Crusoe's story is a very
long one, we cannot give an account
of every thing he mentions in his own
history. but must content ourselves
with noticing the most interesting cir-
cumstances.

It happened very fortunately for
Robinson that the island had no savage
or venomous beasts upon it, which
was rather surprising for a spot-in the
torrid zone. He found indeed wild
cats and wild goats, both of which he
tamed, and made of them a sort of
companions. Besides these, there were
birds, some of them good for food, and
parrots, one of which he caught, and
taught it to call him by his name.

His provisions brought from thet

ship would not have snbsisted him
more than a few months, so that he
was very glad to find supplies on the
island of some sort. He had the
flesh and milk of the goats. of whose
skins he made himself clothes; and
he found grapes and wild fruits in
abundance. There were, besides, hares
and rabbits, and fish to be obtained,
occasionally from the sea. Still he
would have wanted corn vietuals, if
he had not chanced to shake out one
of the ship's bags in which a few grains
had remained. These sprang up, and
in time produced him all that he
required for himself and his goats.

Ir was some time before poor Robin-
son recovered his usual health and
strength; he could do little but
wander slowly about, trusting to
Nature as his only physician. When,
however, he became quite well, be
determined to make a more extensive
survey of the island than he had done
before; so he set out one fine morning
with such provisions as he could con.
veniently carry.

Wandering up by the banks of a
brook, he found many pleasant
meadows, rich and verdant; and in
places were growing many splendid
plants and flowers peculiar to the
warm climates. The chief of these
were aloes, sugar-canes, tobacco-plants,
and melons. Proceeding further, be97

BUT notwithstanding the fruits and
the animals Robinson obtained, he
found that he must turn farmer or
husbandman in earnest, if he would
be sure of a certain store of food for
the future. So he enclosed a piece of
ground, dug it up with much labour,
and sowed the grain in the proper
season. Do you know that the climate
in the torrid zone has only two kinds
of weather to mark the year, the
rainy season and the dry: thus it is
rainy in our spring and, autumn, and
dry during our summer and winter.
The first time he sowed his corn, he
lost his crop for Want of knowing this:
the dry season came, and it was all

twenty other things, and king of the
country at the same time. All this
was very curious, and it is certainly
entertaining enough to read about;
but Robinson would rather have been
engaged in any one of those trades in
England, and no king at all, than shut
up in his lone island, with nobody butfia'

What do you think of the matter 1 fig

W1: must now inquire more par.
ticularly how our friend Robinson
proceeded in some of the cmployments
just mentioned.- Poor fellow! he
tells us that he had no pots or pans
to put and carry any liquid in, nor a
basket to take provisions with him on
a journey. Luckily he found some
willow-trees, whose long boughs and
tough twigs enabled him to provide
himself with baskets both light and
strong, though not perhaps very neat
or ornamental. He was more troubled
to make pots and pans, and would
have given several pieces of his useless
gold for a good pitcher and a brown
dish, such as in England we can get
for a few pence. However, he set to
work; but he says we should both

pity and laugh were we to see the
awkward, mis-shapen things he made
at first. Why, his pots fell in and
his pots fell out with their own weight;
and as for liquors, they all preferred
making the best of their way out, to
remaining confined in such ugly
apartments. But at length he found
out the method of fogrming these
vessels better, and of hardening them
too; for, finding a piece of one of
them which had been in the fire acci-
dentally baked as hard as a stone, he
took the hint, and building up lighted
embers round his pots, made them as
solid as he wished.

Rosmson's next concern was to
procure the means of grinding or
rather bruising his corn, for it was
neither convenient nor wholesome to
eat it whole. To construct a mill to
grind it, was out of the question;
though I dare say the island had both
wind and water. It was .needful to
devise some more simple machine,
and he could think of nothing better
than a pestle and mortar. He spent
many a day endeavouring to find a
great stone big enough to hollow out
for the purpose, but was unsuccessful;
and, probably, if he had obtained one,
he could not have cut into it. At
last he procured a block of wood hard
enough, which he sc00ped out with
fire and labour. It was not very dif-

ficult to form a pestle, or beater, with
a heavy knob at the end of the same
material. There he is, pounding away,
and quite busy. I am afraid, with
all his labour, his flour was very coarse
and husky, so that his bread and
puddings must have set him coughing
sometimes.112 soarssox causos.

Pooa Robinson had a laborious time
of it when he turned carpenter; for
though he had trees enough, it cost
him weeks of toil to cut one down;
and then to make them into boards
without a saw was sad fatiguing work
indeed. He says he was forty-two
whole days making one long shelf for
his cave; for he had to chop each side
flat with his axe, so that you see one
tree made but one board; but a
sawyer would in half a day have cut
out twenty or more. But he had a
more important project in his head
than making a shelf, or even a house.
What could it be?-did he wish to
build a church, or a castle, or a tower 1'

I surrose you must have guessed
by this time that the thing Crusoe
most desired was a ship, or even a
boat, to beat him, if not to England,
at least to some land where there
were human beings to converse with!
Yes, that was what he longed for--
society. How thankful we ought all
to be for kind friends and relatives,
always at hand to aid or cheer us!
Solitude is the greatest punishment
almost that can be inflicted on us in
this life, and so Robinson found it.

As he walked one day by the sea- i
side, full of these thoughts, he saw
the large boat belonging to the ship-
wrecked vessel lying high up on the

few minutes, they would have turned
it over, and brought it to the sea, so
as to have floated off at high tide.
But there was only poor Robinson,
who, although he got levers and roller:

not move the boat a foot! Then he

I AM ready to think that it would
have been better for Robinson to con-
tent himself as well as he could on
his island, than to attempt to venture
outtoscainaboatby himself, if he had
one ready for his use. But he thought
differently; and finding that there were
no hopes of managing the ship's boat,
he resolved to try and make one--
he that had been seven weeks making
one single board! But so intent was
he on this scheme, that he did not
even reflect on the possibility of con-
veying the new boat to the sea, from
the wood where the tree was to be
felled. He owns that he acted very
much like a simpleton in all this
business. However, to work he went,

six feet in diameter--that is, in width
straight across at the bottom. It is
most surprising that he could ever
fall such a tree! He says he was
twenty days hewing and hacking at it
to cut it down; fourteen more getting .
the top and branches off. Then it
took him a month to shape the outside
of the log into something like the
fashion of a boat, and three months
more to hollow it out with fire and
labour.

So at last his boat was so far finished,
and it was big enough, he says, to have
carried six.and.twenty men! In fact,
he was quite delighted with it; but
does it not look odd to see him ad.
miring it so much, lying, as it does, in
the midst of a wood, not a. hit of
rippling ocean to be seen!
Ronnvsorz tells us that he was highly
delighted with his boat: but soon came
the sad reflection that it was not in,
nor near the water; and it happened,
unluckily, that between the boat and
the sea there was a hill! Now he
had no more power to move this boat
than the other, and the distance was
greater. It seems that he never thought
of that. At first. he tried to cut the
hill away; but that was rather too much
for him, and there was no railway
company to undertake it. Then he
thought to dig a canal or dock to let
the water up to the spot; and he cal.
culated that this would occupy him
ten or twelve years at least, there
being only two excavators, his right
hand and his left, to perform the work.

This he thought was too much to
attempt, and so he gave up all thoughts
of launching this boat, which had
pleased him so highly at first. When
he had finished this boat, he had been
four years on that lonely, unknown
island!
AND- now Robinson tells us a little
of his condition. His clothes were
nearly worn to rags; his beard re-
sembled that of the goats around him;
his shoes and stockings were long ago
worn out, nor had he a hat to his
head. As to provisions, those ob.
tained from the ship of course were
all gone; and what was worse, his
powder and shot, with which he pro-
cured game, were ncarly expended also.
His ink, too, with which he wrote a.
daily account of his affairs, was almost
gone; and this want grieved him as
much as the others, some of which he
could in a sort of way supply. As
for clothes, he managed pretty well
with his goabskins and threads of the
same to batch himself up a suit; nay,

more, he made an umbrella of the
same material to defend him from the
heat of the sun: and thus equipped,
our engraving represents him walking
about his island.

His chief employments were, culti-
vating his fields and garden; gathering,
curing, and packing his fruits; attend.
ing his tamed animals; procuring and
dressing his food;.with various other
operations and labours needful in his
situation. F inding, however, that he
had still time on his hands, his mind
strangely reverted to his former design
of escaping if possible from the island.

He therefore set about making a
much smaller and more manageable
boat or canoe than the former one,
and this task he completed success.
fully in about two years. He made
a mast and a sail out of the old ship's
stores; and having launched his little
vessel, was delighted to find that she
sailed very well.

In this curious canoe Robinson
made several short voyages of dis-
covery about the island, and at length
resolved to go completely round it.
So he victualled his ship for the
voyage, putting in two dozen loaves
of barley bread, an earthen pot full of
parched rice, a little bottle of rum,
half a goat, and some powder and shot.

from the weather. He says that it
was on the 8th of November, in the
6th year of his reign, or his captivity,
that he embarked on this voyage, not
without some apprehensions of the
dangers to which he might be exposed.
He took a sort of leave of his various
dumb acquaintances at his departure
from them. See, he is now pushing
off from the shore! Take care, Robin-
son-- your bark is but a frail one, I
fear :---I think you had better keep at
home!
Rosmsos, it seems, would sooner en-
counter adventures, and even dangers,
than have dull ease and safety. He

soon found that though the island
was not large, the ledges of rocks
about it forced him a good way out to
sea, and he narrowly escaped being
thrown upon them. When he had
passed these, he came to a furious
current, that is, a driving rush of
water in the sea, such as you observe
at the sluice of a watenmill. He was
now between the rocks and this
current, which he feared would carry
away his boat and overwhelm it. He
continued beating about here for two
days, unable to return, the wind being
contrary, and having only a choice of
dangers during that time. Then he
thought of his quiet but and cave on
the island, and the provision and
other comforts there stored up, and

bitterly reproached himself for his
restless desire of change. He stretched
forth his hands towards the island,
and said, "0 happy, happy spot, I
shall never see thee more! 0 miser-
able creature, whither am I going 1"
Now was he being driven into the
wide ocean, in despair of ever reachin
the land again. But. just as he h
given himself up for lost, a breeze
arose towards the island. So on be
spread his little sail and plied his oars;
and so in the course of two or three
hours he regained the island, and
falling on his knees when he had
stepped ashore, he devoutly thanked
Almighty God for this great deliver-
ance. He laid himself down in his
cave to refresh his weary limbs. and

.Rosmson answered his parrot very
kindly, and, perhaps for want of other
cars, acknowledged to the bird how
very foolish he had been. He now
made himself more contented at home,
and set about improving his condition.
He made much better chairs and
tables, pots and pans, baskets, and
other useful articles, than he had at
first. Then he determined to increase
his stock of goats, as his powder and
shot got low, with which he had pro.
cured game. So he made pitfalls for
the wild goats, in which at last
he caught as many as he required. He
enclosed for them a spacious meadow,
and thus could manage them without
inconvenience. His stock increased
so, that in about two years he had

nearly fifty goats, young and old. So
he had goat's flesh, and milk, too,
when he pleased. .

See him now in his cave, sittin

knowing, his two cats on the other
looking very loving, and an old dog
at his feet. I wonder what he has

ROBINSON wished very much that
some one could have taken a sketch
of him, in his walkingudress, as he
strolled about the island. He has
described it so, that the artist has, I
see, accomplished the task. We will
explain it in his own words. "I
had a great, high, shapeless cap, made
of a goat's skin, with a. flap hanging
down behind, as well to keep the sun
from me as to keep out the rain. I
had a short jacket of goat's skin, with
longtskirts; pantaloons' of the same
shaggy material; of which also I had
socks or buskins, that supplied the
place of shoes and stockings. I had

and shot; at my back I carried a
basket, on my shoulder a gun, and
over my head a great clumsy thing
made of goat's skin, like an umbrella,
to keep ofl' the sun." So much for
the appearance and condition of our
friend Robinson Crusoe; we must
now attend to other things, as new
events soon opened upon him. "It
happened," says he, "one day, about
noon, as I was walking on the show,
that I discerned, to my unspeakable
surprise, the plain impression of a
man's foot on the sand 1"
RosmsoN declares that he stood like
one thunderstruck; he listened, looked
around, mounted a hill, listened again,
but could perceive nothing more. At
length he sped home as fast as his
legs would carry him, fearing an
enemy at every turn. He skipped
over the wall of his enclosure, and
drew the ladder quietly after him,
and passed a sleepless night. Now
again he wished for that undisturbed
solitude of which he had complained
hefore. He wearied his brain with
conjectures as to who the persons
could be, whose footanarks he had
seen, and whence they could have
come. He continued in this alarm

some days, during which time he
scarcely dared to peep abroad. When

he did so, he saw nothing of any human
beings; but determined to render his
dwelling more secure by strengthening
the fences round his dwelling, and
thus making them answer the purpose
of fortifications to his little castle! He,
however, passed two years more with.
out disturbance of any kind, and the
fear of enemies began to subside, till
again his solitude was his chief afflic-
tion.152 aoamsou <<use;

AND now poor Robinson thought
he might venture abroad again without
apprehension, and was walking near
the sea-shore as before, when a sight
presented itself which made his hair
stand on end with surprise and horror.
The shore was spread with skulls,
hands, feet, and other bones of human
bodies'; and there was a hole dug in
which had been a fire, and these
human bones, he perceived, had evi.
dently been roasted at it! Cannibals
had been there! What are cannibals?
I must tell you--they are savage and
wicked men, who kill and devour one
another! Oh, how dreadful is the
thought!---Now I suppose you no
longer wish to dwell on Robinson
Crusoe's island? Barbarous nations
there were in great numbers, who
made a constant practice of eating
their enemies whenever they could
catch them. Oh, let us be thankful
that our lot is cast in a happier country,
where no such horrid doings were
ever known. I am afraid we must
not say that the dreadful custom of
feasting on human flesh is even now

quite disused in all parts of the world.
Rosmsos nearly fainted at the dread-
fiil sight of these human remains, and
was in fact made ill by the excess of
his feelings and disgust. When he
regained his home, he endeavoured to
compose himself, and thanked God
that he had been brought -up, not
with such monsters, but in civilised
society. He was, however, not quite
so much alarmed on account of his
own safety as before; for, as he had
lived on the island eighteen years, he
knew that it was inhabited by no
human being but himself, and believed
that the savages only used the spot as
an occasional retreat, for the purpose
of enjoying their inhuman repast in
greater security. He therefore con-
tented himself with avoiding generally

that part of the island where the
savages had landed, arid made himself
as snug and safe as he could in his own
dwelling; he loaded his guns and pis.
tols, and kept much at home: but one
day, mounting the hill above his cave,
he plainly perceived a smoke at no
great distance, and thus it was evident
that danger was approaching him. He
peeped through the bushes a little
further on, and saw nine savages
dancing round a fire, at which, he
doubted not, the flesh of human
beings was then roasting! In a few
hours, the savages took to their canoes,
and then Robinson carefully ap-
proached the spot they had left. The
remains of their feast were too homd
to describe.
Rosmson was now indeed afraid
that he should one day fall into the
hands of these dreadful barbarians.
He, however, passed a year or two
without seeing any more of them.
But now a surprise of quite a different
kind startled him one day as he was
musing in his cave. It was the distinct
sound of a ship's gun! He started
up instantly, and mounting the hill,
looked out to sea, and saw a flash of
fire, soon followed by the report of a
second gun. Now he felt convinced
that there was some ship in distress
out at sea--for, do you know, that
when they are in very great difficulty
and danger out at sea, and are afraid
of being wrecked, they fire guns every
minute, to inform any persons who

may be within hearing that help is
wanted. Robinson made a fire as a
signal, which was soon answered by
another gun: he looked out, and
could just see an object out at sea
but the weather was too hazy to dis
cern it distinctly. The next morning
he looked out again, and then saw
plainly enough the wreck of a ship,
cast away on the same rocks as those
on which himself had been thrown

many years before

1.2
WflEN the sea was calm, Robinson
rowed himself to the wreck, and found
that not a soul on board was lefl.
alive. He obtained from the vessel
many articles of which he was much
in want, and made many voyages for
that purpose, as he had done before.

Another year or two passed away,
and Robinson continued as solitary as
ever; but at length it seemed as if he
was to have company more than
enough, for he saw five canoes full of
savages approaching the island! He
fetched the telescope which he had
obtained from the ship, and, climbing
his hill of observation, he plainly
discerned about thirty persons sitting

round a fire, and two apparently
bound, ready to be killed! One of

these he presently saw, releasing him-
self from his bonds, dart away from
his enemies like lightning towards the
woods. With such amazing swifiness
did he run, urged by hopes and fears
for his life, that he left his pursuers
far behind, and rapidly approached
the spot where Robinson was standing,
who now thought it time to interfere.
He sprang in between the pursuers
and the pursued, and firing of, first a
pistol, and then a musket, so despe.
rately alarmed the savages, who had
never heard fire-arms before, and who
saw one of their companions drop
dead, that they immediately took to
their canoes, and went away as fast as
they could ply their oars.
Tm: young savage who had escaped
from his enemies was not less alarmed
than the rest, and fell flat on his face
before Robinson, who had much ado
to soothe him, and to persuade him to
use.

You see this young savage would
have been killed and eaten in a very
short time, if he had not slipped his
cords and run away. He seemed
very thankful to Robinson, though of
course he could not make himself
understood by words; and, to make
short of it, Robinson found him a
very excellent companion and assist-
ant, when he had taught him a few
things and a few words of English.
As it was on a Friday that Robinson
first saw him, he gave him that name,
 

Friday's Gratitude.
and you will hear of him now as his
man Friday! He was very clever,
expert, obedient, and attached to his
master; he soon learned the use of
European implements, and could shoot
game with a gun exceedingly well.
Robinson taught him the principles of
religion, made him abhor the savage
practices of his own nation, and, in
fact, educated him and civilised him
completely in the course of time.
ROBINSON and his man Friday
passed some years together without
any particular adventure. It was one
morning in the year, which was the
twenty-seventh of Crusoe's captivity
in the island, that Friday perceived a
number of canoes, full of savages, ap-
proaching the island. The young
man was dreadfully frightened, think-
ing they were come to seek for him,
and eat him up; but Robinson com-
forted him, and promised to defend
him. When the savages had sat
down on the shore, it was soon evident
that they were come on their old
errand, and meditated another horrid
feast. So Robinson and Friday each
took as many guns as they could
carry, and determined to put a stop

to such dreadful proceedings. They

approached as near as they could
without being discovered, and could
see plainly about twenty savages
feasting away, and two wretched ones
bound, ready to be killed. Then
Robinson determined to fire their
guns at the savage men. This they
repeated until two or three of the
savages were killed, many wounded,
and the rest most dreadfully frightened,
not knowing whence this attack pro-
ceeded. In great consternation, they
jumped up, and took to their boats,
leaving their prisoners still bound on ~
the shore. One of these, it appeared,
was a white man, a Spaniard, who
jumped for joy at his deliverance, so
happy and so unexpected. Who do
you think the other was? I will tell
you presently.
Tm: other intended victim, thus
surprisingly released, was an old man,
at whom Friday gazed at first with
intense earnestness, and at length,
rushing towards him, clasped in his
arms his own father! It is impossible
to describe the mutual joy of parent
and child on this occasion. Friday
danced about him, and showed the

utmost degree of filial duty and affec-
tion. He rubbed his benumbed

hands, brought him drink and food,
and had the satisfaction of seeing his
father's activity at length restored.
Robinson was scarcely less surprised
and pleased at this strange event; and
now questioned the Spaniard, and
found that he too had been cast away,
but not on an uninhabited land. He

had lived some time with the natives,
when they were attacked and over-
powered by a neighbouring tribe, who
took himself and many others pri~

soners, who would all have been
devoured had they not been delivered
by Robinson and his man Friday.
Very thankful they were for their
escape, and for the food and shelter
Robinson gave them. He might
now indeed call himself a king, havmg
subjects three in number, who ac.
knowledged his authority: but we
have more events presently to relate.
Moan visitors now poured in on
Robinson. One morning, his man
Friday ran and told him that a canoe,
such as he had never seen before, was
in sight, and rowing towards them.
Robinson soon perceived that they
were Europeans--yes--and how great
was his joy to find that they were
English, too! Yet he had his fears
that these people could be after no
good, and there had been no storm to
injure any vessel. So Robinson kept
on his guard, and now saw plainly an
English ship at anchor at no great
distance. The boat drew to shore,
the men landed, and bore on their
shoulders three persons bound as pri-
soners. Robinson soon found out
what was the nature of the case, and

being a man of courage, determined,
if possible, to release these prisoners,
as he had done the others. Whilst,
therefore, the sailors were absent,
ranging in the woods, he and Friday
approached, and unbinding the men,
who were utterly astonished at their
deliverers, bade them defend them-
selves, and put arms into their hands.
These three, with Robinson and his
companions, made seven in all. who,
finding the sailors in the woods drunk
or asleep, came on them unawares,
bound them all with cords, and so
made them prisoners in turn!-Was
not that well done ?
I CANNOT describe the surprise and
alarm of these men at finding them-
selves bound fast, and their prisoners
released; but they were obliged to
submit. The fact is, these sailors
were mutimers, --- that is, they had
rebelled against the captain and ofiicers
of their ship, and had brought them
to this island for the purpose of
leaving them to perish; but you see
their violent doings were overruled
against them. They now implored
mercy, for they knew they were in
the power of their officers again, and
had deserved to die. Their captain
referred all to Robinson. whom they
made judge in this business. He
said he could not promise them what
he would do for two or three days--

dering that their companions did not
return, sent another boatl'ul to the
island, leaving only two or three in
the vessel. When Robinson and his
men saw them coming, they hid them-
selves; and as soon as the men stepped
ashore, they rushed upon them so
suddenly, and with such resolution,
that they mastered them every one,
and took possession of both their boats.
Roamson and the captain managed
matters so well that they got posses.
sion of the ship, and granted the men
their lives on condition that the worst
of them should remain on the island,
and the others return to their duty,
and work the ship back to England.
And so you see Robinson had an
opportunity of returning to his native
land at last. He and his man Friday
took leave of the island, and brought
the Spaniard away with them. F riday's
father went back to his own country,
and the rest of the English sailors
took possession of Robinson's island
with his permission. He arrived in
England after thirty years' absence,
and found very few of his relatives
alive. Robinson was so fortunate as

to dispose of his plantations in the
Brazils for a great deal of money,
with which he bought a farm in
England, Friday still continuing his
most faithful servant. I find that
Robinson, some years after, paid his
island a visit, regulated matters there,
and again returned to England, where

he died, at a good old age.
