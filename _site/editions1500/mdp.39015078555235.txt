.§@e,-
I WAS born of a good family in the city of York, where-
my father, who was a native of Bremen, had settled after
his having got a handsome estate by merchandize. 1\*Iy
brain was early lled with rambling thoughts, and when
I grew up, my father often persuaded me to settle to some
business, and my mother used the tenderest entreaties, yet
nothing could prevail upon me to lay aside my desire of
-going to sea ; notwithstanding the extreme uneasiness which
my father and mother always shewed at the thoughts of my
caving them. I -hardened myself against the prudent and
'l~!lCl advice of my kind indulgent parents: and being one
day at Hull, I met with one of my companions, who was
going to sea in his father‘s ship, he easily persuaded me to
go with him.
On the lst of September, 1651, I went on board this
ship, which was bound for London, and without letting my
father know the rash and disobedient step I had taken, set
sail; but no sooner was the ship out of the Humber, than
the wind began to blow, and the sea to‘ rise in a most
terrible manner. Having never been at sea before, I was
extremely sick, and my mind was lled with terror, I then
began to grow sensible of my wickedness, in disobeying the
best of parents.
The next day the wind abated, and the sea grew calm;
I was no longer sea sick, and my companion laughed at my
fears. The weather continued calm for several days, and
we at length came into Yarmouth road, where we cast
anchor to wait for a wind. Un the eighth clay Ill the morn-
ing, the wind increased , and we had all hands at work to
strike our tow-masts, and to cast our sheet anchor
ohshaseae Crusoe,
\
I now began to see terror and amazement in the faces
even of the seamen themselves ; and as the master passed
by me, I could hear him say softly to himself, “ Lord be
merciful to us, we shall be lost." When I heard this I was
terribly frightened ; such a dismal sight I never before saw,
the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every three
or four minutes.
I cannot express the horror of mind I was then seized
with. The storm still increased, and I saw (what is but too
seldom seen) the master, the boatswain, and several others
at prayers, expecting that every moment the ship would go
to the bottom. The storm however beginning to abate, the
master red guns for help, and a light ship which had rid
it out just a—head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It
was with the utmost hazard that it came near us: and our
men casting a rope over the stern with a buoy, they after
much labour and hazard got hold of it, and we hauling them
close under the stern, got all into the boat. . But we had
hardly left the ship a quarter of an hour, when we saw her
founder. My heart seemed dead within me with fright,
horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.
As it was impossible for the boat to get up with the ship
to which she belonged, we endeavoured to reach the shore,
and partly by rowing and partly by being driven by the
waves, we at last with great diiculty got to land, and walk-
ed to Yarmouth.
Had I now had the sense to return home, my father
would have received me with tenderness : but a weak and
foolish shame opposed all thoughts of it; I was afraid of
being laughed at among the neighbours, and should be
ashamed to see not only my father, but every body else. I
shad, without blushing committed an action which bore all
the marks of folly; but was ashamed of returning, though
that was the wisest step I could have taken. I remained
some time in doubt what course to take; but having money
in my pocket, I travelled to London by land.
On my arrival in that city, I happily contracted an ac-
quaintance with the master of a ship who had been on the
coast of Guinea; taking a fancy to me, told me, thatif I
would go the voyage with him, I should be at no expence;
and if I would carry any thing with me, I should have the
advantage of trading for myself. Encouraged by this offer
‘O
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 5
by the assistance of some of my relations, with whom l
still corresponded, I raised 40]. which I laid out in such
toys and tries, as he directed me to buy. But though in
this voyage I was continually sick; yet under my worthy
friend, I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics,
and the rules of navigation; leamed how to keep an ac-
count of the ship’s course, and to take an observation: this
voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I
brought home ve pounds nine ounces of gold dust for my
adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return
almost 3001.
Iwas now set up for a Guinea trader ; but my friend, to
my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I re-
solved to go the same voyage again, and having left 2001.
in the hands of my friend’s widow, I embarked in the same
vessel. This was one of the most unhappy voyages that
ever man made; for as we were steering between the
Canary islands and the African shore, we were surprised in
the grey of the morning by a Moorish rover of Salee, who
gave chase to us, with all the sail she could make. Finding
that the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly come
up with us in a few hours, we prepared to ght; our ship
having twelve guns, and the pirate eighteen. About three
in the afternoon he came up with us, and a very smart
engagement ensued ; but after having twice cleared the
deck of the Moors, and lost three of our men, and had eight
wounded, we were obliged to submit, and we were all car-
ried prisoners into Salee, a port belonging to the Moors.
I was kept by the captain of the rover as his own prize,
and made his slave.
My master having the long-boat of our English ship,
had a little state room or cabin built in the middle of it,
like a barge, with a place behind it to steer, and haul
home the mainsheet, and another before, for a hand or two
to stand and work the sails.
In this pleasure boat we frequently went out a shing,
and one day he had appointed to go out with two or three
Moors of distinction, and had therefore sent over night a
larger store of provisions than usual; and ordered me to
get ready two or three fusees with powder and shot, which
were on board his ship; for that they designed to have
sport at fowling as well as shing. But in the morning
he came on board, telling me that his guest had declined
going, and ordered me, with the man and boy, to sail out
with the boat, and catch some sh, for his friends were to
sup with hi-m.
At this moment the hopes of my deliverance darted into
my thoughts, every thing being prepared, we sailed out of
the port to sh ; but purposely catching none, I told Muley
that this would not do, and that we must stand farther off,
which he agreeing to, we set the sails, and I having the
helm, ran the boat out near a league farther, and then
brought her to as ifl would sh ; when giving the boy the
helm, I stept forwards, and stooping behind the Moor,
took him by surprize, and tossed him overboard into the
sea ; he arose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and
called to me to take him in ; but fetching out one of the
fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, that if
he came near the boat, I would shoot him, so he turned
about and swam towards the land, and as he was an ex-
cellent swimmer, I make no doubt but that he reached the
shore with ease.
When he was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they call-
ed Xury, and said to him, Xury, ifyou will be faithful to
me I will make you a great man, but if you will not stroke
your face to be true to me, (that is swear by Mahomet and
his father's beard) Imust throw you into the sea too. The
boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I could
not mistrust him; he swore to be faithfu-l to me,_ and to go
over all the world with me.
While I was in view of Muley, I stood o.ut to sea, but it
no sooner grew dark, then I changed my course, and steer-
ed to the south, I made such sail, that before the end of
the next day, I believe, I was beyond the Emperor of
Morocco’s dominions. Yet so dreadful‘ were my ap-
prehensions of falling again into my master’s hands, that]
would not stop to go on shore, till I had sailed in that man-
ner ve days ; and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward, I ventured to come to an anchor at the mouth of a
little river.
The principal thing I wanted was fresh water._ But
though I was no less afraid of the savages than of the wild
beasts,_ our necessities obliged us to land, for we had not a
pint, The next morning‘ Xury asked for one of the jars,
or nonuvson cnusou. 7
and said he would go and seek for water. I asked him why
he would go. The boy answered with so much affection
that] could not help loving him. If wild man comes, they
eat me, you go way. Well Xury, said I, we will both go,
and if the wild men come we will kill them; they shall eat
neither of us. I then gave Xury a dram out of one of the case
bottles, a.nd having hauled the boat as near the shore as
we thought proper, waded to land, carrying nothing but
our arms, and two jars for water.
The boy seeing a low place about a mile up the country,
rambled thither; and by-and-by I saw him come running
towards me, when thinking he might be pursued by some
savage, or frightened by a wild beast, I ran to meet him;
but whenl came nearer, I saw something hanging over his
shoulder, which was a creature he had shot, like a hare,
and we found it very good meat; but the great joy that
poor Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good
water, and seen no wild mans. We therefore lled our
jars, feasted on our hare, and then set sail. i
Several times after we were obliged to go ashore for
fresh water; and once in particular, early in the morning
Xury called softly to me, and told» me, that we had best go
farther off the shore ; for, says he, look yonder lies a dread-
ful monster fast asleep. I looked where he pointed, and
saw a great lion that lay on the side of the shore under the
shade of a piece of the hill that hung a little over him, upon
‘which, charging my three guns, I took aim at his head, but
lying with his foot raised alitttle above his nose, the slug
broke his leg. He started up growling, but fell down
again ; and gave the most hideous roar that ever I heard ;
but ring again, and shooting him in the head, I had the
pleasure to see him drop. I resolved to take olf his skin,
and going ashore, the boy and I accomplished it. Then
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun dried it in two
days time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.
About ten days after, as I was steering out to sea, in
order to double a cape,I had the view of some islands,
which I supposed to be those of Cape Verd. I was afraid
of venturing so far from the shore, for if I should be
taken with a fresh gale of wind, I might never be able to
reach again the one or the other. In this dilemma I silt
down in the cabin: when on a sudden Xury cried out i[1'i.\
fright, “Master! Master! a ship,” foolishly imagining that it
was his masters ship, come so far in pursuit for us, I jump-
ed out of the cabin,pand saw that it wasa Portuguese vessel,
and instantly stretched out to sea with all the sail I could
make; they perceived me by the help of their glasses, and
shortened sail to let me come up. A Scots sailor on board
called to me, and I answered, thatl had made my escape
from the Moors at Salee. They very kindly took me in
and all my goods. _
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived
at All Saints Bay in about twenty-two days. The generous
captain recommended me to an honest man who had a plan-
tation, with whom I lived till I had learnt the manner of
planting and making sugar, after which I purchased a piece
of land, and became a planter. I had lived here about
four years, and had contracted an acquaintance among
several merchants. I had frequently talked to them of the
method of purchasing negroes on the coast of Guinea, and
they being pleased with the project, easily prevailed on me‘
to make a voyage for that purpose. We tted out a ship
of about 120 tons burden, which carried_6 guns, and 14
men, besides the master, his boy, and myself.
In this vessell set sail. We had very ~_ good weather for
about twelve days ; but soon after we had crossed the line,
a violent hurricane drove us quite out of onr reckoning, and
for many days together not any in the ship expected to
save their lives. In this distress, one of our men early one
morning cried out, “ Land I” and we had no soc-ner run
out of the cabin, in hopes of seeing where we were, but
the ship struck upon a shoal. It is not easy to conceive
our consternation ; for as the rage of the sea was great, we
supposed that the ship would, in a few minutes, break to
pieces. We had a boa-t on board, which the mate laid
hold of, and with the help of the rest of the men ung her
over the ship’s side, and getting all unto her, committed
ourselves to _God’s mercy. We steered towards land, but
after we had rowed, or rather been driven, about a league
and a half, a wave‘, mountain high, came rolling a stern of
us with such fury that it overset the boat at once, and se-
parated us from one another. This wave carried me
vast way towards the shore, and having spent itself, wen
hack, and left me‘ upon the land almost dry, but half dead.-
\- . _
or ROBINSON cnusoz. 9
I stood still a few moments to recover breath, till the waters
went from me, and then took to my heels, and with all the
strength I had left me, ran towards the shore. I got to the
main land, clambered up the clifts of the shore, and sat
me down upon the grass. Having rested myself I walked
along the shore in search of fresh water; having found
some and quenched my thirst, Iput some tobacco in my
mouth, to prevent hunger, and having climbed a tree rested
myself till morning.
I thenfound the sea calm, and the tide ebbed so far out
that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship.
The weather being extremely hot, I pulled off my clothes,
and took to the water; but when I came to the ship, I
found no means of getting on board, she lying so high,
that I could nd nothing. within my reach : I swam round
her twice, at last observing a small piece of rope hanging
down, I got hold of it, and got into the forecastle. Here
Ifound that the ship was bulged, and a great deal of water
in the hold; but to my great joy I saw that all the ship's
provisions were dry, and being well disposed to eat, I went
into the bread room, and slipped on a waistcoat, lled my
pockets with biscuit, and eat as I went about other things,
I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took
a dram.
Asl found several spare yards, I let them down with
ropes by the ship's sides, and going down to them, tied
them together, and made a. raft, placing several pieces
of plank upon them crossways, and laid upon it all the
pieces of board that came to hand. I next emptied three
of. the seamen’s chests; then lowered them down upon the
raft, and lled them with ‘bread, some dried goats’s esh
and three Dutch cheeses. I found several cases of bottles,
-in which were some cordial waters, and about ve or six
gallons of arrack ; these I stowed by themselves, there
being no room for them in the chests. ' I also let down the
carpenter’s chest, which was worth more to me than a ship
load of gold. I next found two good fowling-pieces, and
tivo pistols, with some powder horns, two barrels of
powder, and two old rusty swords, all of which I placed
on the raft, and with this invaluable cargo resolved to put
to sea. A V
My raft went very well, and with it I entered 'a creek,
where I thrust it on a at piece of ground, over which the
tide flowed, and there fastened it by sticking a broken oar
into the ground. Thus I stayed till the water ebbed, when
I placed my cargo safe on land.
At night I barricadoed myself round with the chests
and boards I had brought on shore, of which I had made a
kind of hut. ‘
The next day I resolved to make a second voyage. My
raft being too unweildy, I swam to the ship, and made
another, on which I placed two or three bags of nails
and spikes, some hatchets, a grind-stone, two or three iron
Crows, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece, two bar-
rels of musket bullets, a. large bag of small shot, and all the
men’s cloaths I could nd, a square fore-topsail, a ham-
mock, and some bedding; all which I brought safe to land.
I now went to work to make a little hut with the sails,
and some poles, which I cut for that purpose ; and into it
I brought every thing I knew would spoil either with the
sun or rain ; I piled all the empty chests and casks in a
circle round the hut to fortify it" om any sudden attempt
from man or beast; I blocked up the door with boards'
and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my
two pistols just at my head, and my gun by me, Iwent to
bed, and slept veryquietly all night. i
Every day at low water, I went on board, and brought
away something. On my seventh voyage I brought away
a great hogshead of bread, three large runlets of rum, a
box of ne sugar, and a barrel of ne our.
I had been thirteen days on shore, and had been eleven
times on board the ship, but in one of these excursions l
had the misfortune to overset my raft ; but it being in shoal
water, and the things being chiey heavy, I recovered many
of them, when he tide was out. Indeed had the calm
weather continued, I believe I should have brought away
the whole ship, piece by piece: but preparing the twelfth
time to go on board, I found the wind began to rise;
however, at low waterl went; rummaging the cabin, I dis-
covered a locker with draws in it, in one of which I found
two or three razors, and a pair of large scissars, with ten br
a dozen good knives and forks, and in another about 36l.'
value of gold and silver coin. At the sight of this money I
to myself, and said aloud, O drug! what art thou
good for? One of these knives is worth all this heap; I
I have no manner of use for thee ; e'en remain where thou
art, and go to the bottom. However, upon second thoughts,
I took it away, and wrapping it all in a piece of canvas,
began to think of making another raft, but while I was pre-
paring it, the wind began to rise, and to blow off shore; I
then found that it was time to be gone, least I should not
be able to reach the shore; accordingly I let myself down
Into the water, and swam to land, which I performed with
great diiculty, from the weight of the things I had about
me, and the roughness of the water.
It blew very hard all night; and in the morning, when I
looked out, no more ship was to be seen. l now went in
search of a place where I might x my dwelling, endeavour-
ing to chuse one where I might have the advantage of a
nealthy situation, fresh water, and security from being sur-
prized b.y man or beast. I found a littl-e plain. on the side
ofa rising hill, which was there as steep as the side ofa
house, so that nothing could come down to me from the
top: On the side of this rock was a hollow place, like the
entrance oi" a ca.ve, before which I resolved to x my tent.
This plain was not above 100 yards broad, and twice as
long, descending to the sea.
Before I set up my tent, I drew an half circle before
the hollow place, which extended 20 yards, and in this half
circle pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving them into
the ground like piles; they stood about ve feet and a half
out of the ground, sharpened on the top. ThenI took the
pieces of cable I had cut in the ship, and laid them in rows
one upon another up to the top; and this fence was so
strong, that neither man nor beast could enter it. The
The entrance I made by a short ladder to go over the top,
which when I was in I lifted over after me. Into this fence,
l by degrees carried all my riches, all my provisions, am-
munition, and stores and made me a large tent to secure
myself and them from the weather. When I had done this,
I began to work my way into the rock, laying all the earth
and stones I dug out within my fence, in the manner of a
terrace; and thus I had a cave just behind my hut.
But before the above works were completed, a sudden
storm of thunder and lightning lled me with the greatest
terror; for mv powder suddenlv darted into mv mind, and
my heart sunk within me at the thought, that at one blast
it might all be destroyed; on which not only my defence,
but the providing of my food entirely depended. No sooner
was the storm over, than I laid aside every other work to
make boxes and bags, in order to seperate my powder. . I
put them in holes up and down the rocks, in such a manner,
that one parcel could not re another.
While all this was doing, I walked out at least once
every day with my gun, as to see if I could kill any thing
t for food, and to acquaint myself with what the island
produced. The rst time I went out, I had the pleasure to
nd, that there were goats in the island ; but they were so
shy, that it was the most diicult thing in the world to come
up with them ; but observing that they did not easily see
objects above them, I killed them by climbing the rocks,
and shooting at those in the valley. I found in the woods
a kind of wild pigeons, which built in holes of the rocks;
and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to breed them
up tame, but when -they grew old they ew away ; however,
I frequently found their nests, and got their young ones,
which were very good meat. ' .
After I had been about ten or twelve days on shore, it
came into my thoughts that I should lose my reckonin of
time, and should not be able to distinguish the Sundgays
fron1 the working days. To prevent this, I set up a large
square post on the shore where I rst landed, and cut upon
it with a knife, I came on shore here the 30th of September,
1659. Upon the sides I cut every day a notch, and every
seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every rst
day of the month as long again as that long one, and thus
I kept my weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning.
I had got from the ship, some pens, ink, and paper;
some mathematical instruments, and three good bibles,
with several other books, which I carefully secured. I
also brought to shore with me two cats, and a dog swam
an shore, which was a trusty servant to me many years;
nay, he was so good a companion, that I was at a loss for
nothing that he could fetch me; and he only wanted power
of speech to become a most agreeable friend. .
When my habitation was nished, I found it far too small
to contain my moveables; I had hardly room to turn» my-
self; so I set about enlarging my cave, and laboured ti_llI_
\
had worked sideways into the rock farther than my outside
pale, and hewing a way through, made a back door to my
store-house. I then made me a table and chair, which
were great conveniences; shelved one side of my cave, and
knocked up pieces of wood into the rock, to hang my
things on. When my cave was set to rights, it looked like
a general magazine of all necessary things.
What a different situation was I in now, from that I was in
when I rst landed, whenl was afraid of perishing with
hunger, or of being devoured by wild beasts.
But I had scarcely nished my habitation, when an
earthquake had like to have buried me in its ruins. The
fear of being swallowed up alive prevented my sleeping in
quiet, but the apprehensions of lying abroad were equally
terrible, and whenl saw myself concealed and safe from
every other danger, Iwas loth to remove.
In some little time I recovered from my fright, and after
that frequently killed goats for my subsistence, whose fat
supplied my lamp, which was a dish made of clay baked
in the sun; and for a wick I made use of oakum. In the
rummaging among my things, Ifound a little bag with
some husks of corn in it; and wanting it, I shook it out by
the side of my fortication. This was just before some
heavy rain; and about a month afterwards, I saw some
green stalks shooting out of the ground; but how great
was my astonishment, when some time after I saw about
ten or twelve ears of barley! It was some time before I
recollected the bag with the husks; and I thought that they
could have been produced by nothing less than a miracle.
With this barley there also came up a- few stalks of rice;
and these were worth more to me than fty times their
weight in gold ; and I carefully preserved them for seed.
When I had been about a year in the island, I was taken
extremely ill, which frightened me terribly, imagining I
should die for want of proper help. This t of illness
proved a violent ague, which made me so weak, I could
hardly carry my gun : and when the t was on me, I was
almost perished with thirst. One night as I was rumina
tingon my sad condition, expecting the return of my t, i
occured to my thoughts, that the Brasilians took no
physio but tobacco; and l went, directed by Heaven no
doubt, to search for some in the chest; and there I found
a bible! I brought both that and the tobacco to my table,
I -steeped some of the last in rum ; some l burnt in a pan
of coals, holding my head over the fume; and some I
chewed: During the interval of this operation, l opened
my book; and the rst words on which l cast my eyes
were, “ Call upon me in the a'a_2/ of Nimble, and [will de-
liver thee.” The words struck me; butl could read no
more-, for the tobacco made me excessive sleepy. I there-
fore went to bed , and falling into a sound sleep, I believe I
sIept two days ; and awoke perfectly recovered.
I now took a survey of the island; and at about two
miles distance from my habitation, found some ne savan-
nahs, and a little further a variety of fruit, melons upon the
ground, and vines covered with clusters of ripe grapes. I
proceeded with my discoveries, and came to an opening
that seemed to descend to the west, where every thing
was in such constant verdure, that it looked like a beauti-
ful garden. I carried some grapes and a few limes back
with me ; but the grapes were spoiled before I got home.
I went the next day and gathered a large quantity ofgrapes
and, hung them upon the out branches of the-trees, that
they might cure and dry in the sun; but as for the limes
and lemons, I carried as many as l could well stand under.
I was so enamoured with this place, that I built myself a
bower, fenced with a double hedge ; and this country
house, asl called it, cost me two months labour; butl
hardly began to enjoy my habitation, when the rains came
on, and l was obliged to retreat to my old one taking with
me‘ my grapes, which were now become ne raisins of the
sun.
I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats;
but about this time she came home, and encreased my
family with three young kittens: she having bred, as I sup-
posed, by a wild cat, of which there were some in the
woods, -and they soon multiplied so fast, that I was obliged,
to drive them from me.
The rainy and dry ‘seasons now appeared quite regular
to me. I dug a piece of ground as well as I could, with
wooden spade of my own making, and began tosowm
grain; but as Iwas doing it, it occurred to my thoughts
thatl would not sow all, for fear it should not grow, so X
reserved about a handful of each sort; and well it w-as I
did‘-'so.; ‘for it did not come up till many -months afterwards.
When I saw it did not grow, I sought for moister ground,
and dug up a -piece-nearer my own bower, -which answered
to my wishes ; and my crop amounted to about half a peck
of each kind: by this means I was made master of my
business; knew when to sow; and that I might expect
two seed times,» and two harvests every year ; for the corn
I set rstcame up after the next ‘wet season-.
When the rains were over, I made a visit to my bower,
where I found the stakes I set for my defence were shot up
into trees, -which I pruned, and made as much alike as pos-
sible; and they became a complete‘ shade. This was my
work in ‘the dry season; and to employ myself when I
could not golabroad, I made baskets, having, when a child,
taken muchdelight to see a ba.sket-maker.
In one of theldry seasons, I took another ramble, armed
with my gun and a hatchet, and guarded by my faithful
dog. When Ihad passed "the valley in which stood my
bower, I-camewithin view of the sea ; a.nd it being a clear
day, I plainly discovered land ; but whether island or con-
tinent, I could‘ not tell; I guessed that it could not be less
than 20 leaguesolf. I imagined it was some savage coast,
and su~'ch indeed-it~ proved. In this journey Icatched a

lower grounds hares ;- but as they were not like what I
had seen, I was-~ afraid to eat them ; and Ihad no need to
make experiments, -as I had goats, pigeons, and turtle,
which -added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not
have furnished a‘-better table. ‘The shore was covered
with innumerable -turtles ; though, on myside, I had found
but three in a year and a half. Here was also an innite
number of fowls ; but I--was too sparing of my powder to
shootthem. ' I travelled =a-bout twelve miles eastward along
the shore,- -and. then setting up a great post for a mark re-
turned homeward,’ designing that my next -tour-should be
the contrary way-,--tiI~l I» came to this post.
- Itook ai different way-‘ -home from-that I went ; but un-
fortunately IOSi.-HI-yS€If,*&l1(l wandered about very uncom-
ortably; till at-last I» was-obliged-to~ nd out the seaside,
0 seek for my post‘, being tired to death with the heat of
weather and the -weight of mv arms. In this iourney my
dog seized a young kid, and I saved it alive, highly pleased
with the hopes of having a breed of tame goats; but as I
could not bring it along without diiculty, I left it within
the inclosure of my bower.
Inow rested myself a week, employed in the weighty
affair of making a cage for my parrot, which soon became
one of my favourites. I now bethought me of my kid.and
hastened to my bower to bring it home, or to give it food ;
and the poor creature was so tame by hunger, that it fol-
lowed me home like a dog. From that time it became one
of my domestics also, and would never leave me. -
My corn was now coming up; and the goats and hares
having tasted the sweetness of the blade, lay at it night and
day, as soon as it sprang out of the ground, so that it could
get no time to shoot into a stalk. To defend it, I sur-
rounded it with a hedge, and, in the mean while, shooting
some of the creatures by day, I set my dog to watch it by
night, which he did so faithfully, that the enemies forsook
the place, and the corn grew, and began to ripen apace.
When the corn was in ear, I was nearly as much troubled
by birds; but having killed three, I used them as we do
murderers in England, hanged them in chains, to serve as a
terror to the rest. Not a fowl afterwards came near my
corn, indeed, near the place, as long as my scare-crows
hung there.
When my corn was ripe, I made me a scythe with a
sword, and cut off none but the ears, which I rubbed out
with my hands. At the end of my harvest, I guessed I had
a bushel of rice, and two bushels and a half of barley. I
kept all this for seed, and bore the want of bread with
patience, as I had now a tolerable prospect of having as
much as I wanted. ~
This article of bread was a great diiculty ; I had
neither plough nor harrow: For the rstl made my shovel
do; and to supply the place of a harrow, I went over it
myself, dragging after me the heavy boughs of a tree: and
when I came to make bread, I had innumerable wants: I
wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt
to make it into bread, and an oven to bake it. However, I
had six months to contrive all these things in. In the mean
time I enlarged the enclosure of my arable land. I made
me some mis-shapen pots of clav, that all broke in the sun,
except‘ two, which I cased in wicker-work ; but I succeeded
better in little pans, at dishes, and pitchers, which the
sun baked surprisingly hard ; but they would not bear the
re so as to hold any liquid, and I wanted one to boil my
meat.
One day, after I had dressed my dinner, I went to put
out my re, and found a piece of one of my earthen vessels
burnt as hard as a stone, and as red as a tile: this taught
me to burn my pipkins; and I soon wanted for no sort of
earthen vessels : when I found that I had made a pot which
would bear the re, I set it on with a piece of kid, in order
to make me some broth, which answered tolerably well.
I made _me a wooden morter and pestle, and also a sieve
out of some of the seamen's neck-cloths, and at length
made a sort of oven of a broad shallow earthen vessel, and a
tiled hearth. When I baked, I drew the live embers for-
wards upon the hearth, till it was very] hot; then sweeping
them away, I set down my loaves, w elming the earthen
pot over them, which baked my barley bread, as well as
the best oven in the world ; and I now became a complete
pastry-cook. ‘_
My thoughts often ran upon the land I had seen ; and I
began to make myself a canoe. I fell a great cedar, but
when the impossibility of launching this heavy thing came
in my mind, I gave-myself this foolish answer, “ Let me
but once make it, and I’ll warrant I’ll get it along when it
is done.” But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, and therefore I gave it over, determining to enjoy what
I had, without repining for what -I could not get.
My cloaths now began to decay : so I made myself two
Waistcoats out of some watch coats, which lasted me a
great while. I made a cap out of a goat’s skin, with the
hair side outwards, to throw of the rain, and also another
waistcoat of the same skin; but I must acknowledge that
they ‘were wretchedly done. Imade me too a umbrella,
which I could shut up, and take abroad with me ; and this
secured me both from the heat and the rain.
I now built me a small boat, intending to go round my
Iitttle kingdom, but in which I had nearly lost my life
almost dead with fatigue,I at length‘ arrived at my little
castle. I got over the fence, and laid me down to sleep in
the shade: but judge mv surprize, when I waked by a
voice calling me by the name several times,,.Robin,.R0bin
Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe, where are you ?‘w1.m have yea
been ? I was sodead asleep at rst, that I thought It dreamt
some body spoke to me ; but as the voice -continuedito ire-
peat Robin Crusoe, I awaked dreadfully frightened';,_ but
no sooner were my eyes open, than I saw my Pol sitting
on the hedge, and immediately knew that it was lie that
spoke to me. I immediately called him ;_ and the poor
sociable creature came as he used to do, and.‘ sat on" my
thumb crying Poor Robin Crusoe, as if 'he._lia.d' been over-
joyed to see me again.
This dangerous ramble reconciled, me to my desolate
island, and resigned me to the despensations of Providence.
l began now to» perceive my powder considerably abated;
and this was ya want which it- was impossible for me to sup-
ply. Dreading what would become of me when I could
kill no more goats, (for my kid did not breed-',)I set snares
to catch some alive, and particularly wan-teda she goat
with kid ; but my snares were broken andmy bait devoured.
At length-I resolved to try pit falls ; in one of which I found
a large old he goat, and in another three kids,_a male and
two females. _ The old one was so erce th-atI durst. not
meddle with him; but the three kids I brought home. It
was some timebefore they__ would feed; b.ut, however they
grew tame, and I had the pleasure to nd, that I might sup-
ply myself with goat’s flesh, when I had no powder or shot
left. I inclosed a piece of ground to keep my goats, pro-
posing, as my ock encreased, to add more ground to my
inclosure; and I had soon not only goat's esh to feed on,
but milk too; for now] set up a dairy, and made myself
butter and cheese. It would have made a Stoic smile, to
see me and my family sit down to dinner: There was my
majesty, all alone like a king, attended with my servants.
Pol, my favourite, was the only person, permitted to talk
to me.“ My dog, was grown very old, sat always at my
right hand, and my two cats, one on the one side of the
table, and the other on the other, expecting now and then
a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favour.
I had at length a great mind to go to the point of the
island; to see how the shore lay, and resolved to travel
thither by land, And now, reader, I will give thee a short
sketch of the gure I made. I had a great high, shapeIcS8
cap, made of a goat's skin, ajacket, with the skirts coming
down to‘ the middle of my thighs; and a pair of open
knee’d breeches of the same with the goats hair hanging to
the middle of my leg. Stockings and shoes I had none;
but I had made a pair of somethings, I scarce knew what to
call them, to ap over my legs like spatterdashes, but of a
most barbarous shape; and so indeed were all the rest of
my cloaths. I had a broad belt of goat-skin dried; and
I hung on one side a saw, and on the other an hatchet.
I had another belt, not so broad, fastened over my shoulder.
Under my arm hung two pouches, for my shot and powder:
On my back I carried a basket; on my shoulder a gun,
and over my head, a great, clumsy, ugly umbrella. My
beard was cut short, except what grew on my upper lip,
which I had trimmed into a pair of large Mahometan
whiskers : But as for my gure, l had so few to observe me,
that it was of noi manner of consequence.
ln this gural went my new journey, and was out ve
or six days. I was exceedingly surprized with the print of
a man’s naked foot on the shore, which was plainly to be
seen in the sand. I listened, Icould hear nothing, I wen
upon a rising ground, to look farther : but I could see only
that one impression. There was plainly a foot, toes, heel,
and every part very distinct. I hurried home to my forti-
cations, looking behind me every two or three steps, and
fancying every tree, bush, and stump, to be a man. I had
no sleep that night: but my terror gradually wore off ;
however I strengthened my fortication, and planted a
number of stakes on the outside of my wall, which growing,
became a- thick grove. '
j After having secured my habitation in the strongest man-
ner possible, I sought for a place of security for my live
goats; and at length found a piece of ground, rendered al-
most inaccessible by nature, so that it cost me but little
pains to make it so; and then I removed the she-goats
and two he-goats into it ~ _
After I hadthus secured one part of my live stock, I wen-t
about the whole island, and rambled more to the western
point than I had ever done before. I was presently con-
vinced, that the seeing the print of a man’s foot, was not
such a strange thing in the island, as I had imagined, for on
my approaching the shore, I was perfectly confounded, nor
is it possible to express the horror I felt at seeing the shore
spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human
bodies; and particularly a place, where, as I supposed,
tlrere‘ had been a re made, and a circle dug in the earth
for the savage wretches to sit down to their inhuman feasts.
I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle, and left
the place as soon as possible.
One day when I was cutting some brush wood, I found
behind the bush I was cutting, -a hollow place, which I
was curious to look into ; and getting with diiculty into
its mouth, I found it was suicient for me to stand upright
in : but looking farther into the place, which was perfectly
dark-, I saw two broad shining eyes, which twinkled -like
two stars, from a dim light reected from the mouth of the
cave. At this I went out faster than I got in : but pluck-
ing up my courage, I took a great rebrand, and rushed in
again with it aming in my hand; when I was almost as
much frightened as before; for I heard a loud sigh, fol-
lowed by a broken noise, and then a sigh again. I stepped
back, struck with such surprize, that it put me in a cold
sweat. However I recovered resolution enough to step
forward again; and lifting up my light, I saw lying on the
ground a most monstrous he-goat gasping for life. I now
recovered from my fright, and began to look round me.
This cave was -"but twelve feet over; and I observed, that
on the farther side was an opening, into which I crept; but
as I had no light, I defered going farther than the entraiicé
till the next day ; when I crept about ten yards; after
which the roof rose tg about twenty feet high, and the wall
reected an hundred thousand lights from the light I car-
ried. .._It was a delightful grotto, the oor dry, and level,
no damp to be felt. To this place Ibrought all my powder
and all my spare arms, and now kept at my castle oly
ve guns, which stood ready mounted. e
Some time after, in the midst of a -very stormy night, I
was startled at the ring of a gun ; I hastened up to the
top of my hill; and heard anot ier. I i'magi~ned that these
were the signals of a ship in distress; and such it proved,
as I discovered the next day. Icannot explain, the emotion
I felt at '-the sight of this wreck. O that -there had been but
one saved '! cried I, that I might ‘ha-ve had one companion,
or nonms'o1~r ciwson. 21
one fellow creature to have spoken to, and have comforted
in his aflliction.
Under the power of this impression, nothing would serve
me, but I must go in my boat to this wreck, which lay at a
little distance. I furnished myself witha stock of pro-
visions, for fear of being driven out to sea; and having
begun my voyage, I in two hours time reached the ship,
which was Spanish ‘built. She stuck fast jammed in be-
tween two rocks, and all the stern and quarter were beaten
to pieces by the sea. On coming near it, a dog yelped
and cried ; but there was no other living creature on hoard;
and all the goods were spoiled by the water. Ihowever
took two of the seamen’s chests into my boat, without
knowing what was in them.
When I had got my treasure home, and began to unload,
I found several bottles lled with cordial waters, and some
neckcloths a.nd shirts, which were very useful to me; 1100
pieces of eight, and about a pound weight of solid gold,
but of-what use was this to me? I would have given it all
for three or four pairs of shoes and stockings.
After this acquisition, I lived in my old manner, though
teried with fears of the savages. One morning very early,
I saw ve canoes of them on shore. I clambered up my
hill; and, by the help of my perspective, discovered no
less than thirty dancing round a re. I soon after saw two
miserable wretches dragged out of the boats ; one of whom
was immediately knocked down : but the other, starting
from them ran with incredible swiftness along the sands to-
wards me. I confess I was horridly frightened, when I
saw him come my way, imagining he would be pursued by
the ~wliole body : however, I kept my station, and quite
Iost any apprehensions when I found but three followed him.
He greatly .out ran them, and was in a fair way of escaping
them all, when, coming to a creek, he plunged into it,
landed and ran on as swift as before. Of the three that
followed, but two entered the water, the other neturning
back. I hastily fetched my guns from the foot of .the Ind-
der; and having‘ a short cut down the hill, I clapped my
self in the way between the pursuers and the pursued,
hollowing aloud to him that ed, and beckoning then my
hand for him to stop : then rushing at once upon the fore-
most, knocked him down with the stock of my piece. The
other stopped, as if frightened, but when I advanced to-
wards him, I perceived he was tting his bow to shoot me;
upon which I shot him dead directly. The poor savage
who had ed was so terried at the noise of my piece,
though he saw his enemies fallen, that he stood stock still,
but seemed. rather inclined to y than to come towards me.
However, when I gave him signs of encouragement, he
came nearer kneeling down every ten or twelve steps; on
his coming close again, he laid his head upon the ground
and placed my foot upon it. But there was more work to
to do: the man I knocked down came to himself, and my
savage began to be afraid. I. then presented my piece at
the man, when the poor fellow, whose life I had saved,
made a motion for my sword, which I gave him; and he
struck off his enemy's head at one blow, and in a quarter
of an hour buried both the bodies in the sand. I then took
him away to my cave at the farther part of the island.
Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a
draught of water, which he wanted much; and having re-
freshed him, I made signs for him to lie down upon some
rice-straw, which the poor creature did, and soon went to
sleep.
He was a well-made handsome fellow, of about twenty<
six years of "age, of an olive coloured complexion, with
long black hair. He had a small nose, that was not at:
and ne teeth, as white as ivory. After he had slept about
half an hour, he awaked again, and came running to me in
the inelosure, just by wherel had been milking my goats;
then falling down again, he laid his head at upon the
ground, and set my other foot upon it, as before; and after
this made all possible signs of thankfulness, subjection and
submission. I began to speak to him, and to teach him to
speak to me ; and rst, I made him ‘know that his name
should be Friday, which was the day whereonI saved his
life. I taught him to say Master, and let him know that
was to be my name. The next day I gave him cloaths, at
which he seemed pleased. As we went by the place where
he"'had buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the
spot, making signs that he would dig them up again, and
eat them; at this I appeared very angry, and beckoned
with m hands to him to come away, which he did im-
mediateiy.

I-laying, now more C0l1}'g8,. and, consequently more
curiosity, I. took. my. man. Fridaywith. me, giving him the
sword in. his hand, with the bow and arrow. at his back,
whichl found he could use very dexterously. l also gave
him:a.g_un-to carry; and. taking two for myself, away we
marched tothe place were his enemies had been: when I
came there, my blood ran cold in my, veins; the place was
covered with human bones, and the ground dyed with
hlood.;, great pieces of esh were left here and there, half
eaten, mangled, and scorched. I saw three skulls, ve
hands, and the bones of three or four legs and feet: and
Friday, by. his signs, made me understand, that they brought
over four prisoners to feastupon; that three of them were
eaten up, and he, pointing to himself, was the fourth ; and
that they had been conquered, and taken prisoners in war.
I caused Friday to collect the remains of this horrid
carnage; then to light a re and burn them to ashes. When
this was done, we returned to our castle. The next day. I
made a little tent on the outside of my fortication and at
night took in my ladder, that he might not be able to get
at me while-I slept. But there was, no need of this pre-
caution; for never man had a more faithful servant, he
had the same affection for me as a child has for a father ;
and I dare say, he would have sacriced his life to save
mine. I was greatly delighted with him, and made it my
business to teach him every thing proper to render him
useful; especially ¢to speak, and understand me when I
spoke; and he was the aptest scholar that ever was: then
he was so merry, so diligent, and so pleased when he could
understand me, or make me understand him, that he was
very agreeable company.
After I had been two or three days returned to my castle,
l was desirious to bring him off from the relish of human
esh ;_ so I took him out with me one morning to the woods,
in order to take a kid from my herd ; but as I was going, I
saw a she—goat lying down in the shade, and two young
kids sitting by her; when making signs to Friday not to
stir,I shot one of the kids. Poor Friday, who had at a
distance seen me kill the savage his enemy, but did not see
how it was done, trembled, and looked so. amazed, that I
thought he would have sunk down : he did not see the kid
Ihad shot, but ripped up his w,o.i_stco,at to feel if he was
not wounded, and thought I was resolved to kill him; for
he came and kneeled down to me, and embracing my knees,
seemed to entreat me not to kill him. But taking him by
the hand, I laughed at him, and pointing to the kid-I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did.
The next day I set him to beat out some corn, and sift it;
and in a little time Friday was able to do all the work for
me, as well as I could do it myself. In short, this was the
pleasantest year I had led in the island; for as my man
began to talk pretty well, I had some use for my tongue
gain.
abFrom this time I had a mind to venture over, and see if I
could possibly join these bearded men, not doubting but
we might nd some means of escaping. from thence. -
I was now entered into the 27th year of my captivity,
and intended soon to set sail; when one morningl bid
Friday go to the sea-shore to see if he could nd a turtle;
but he had not long been gone gone, when he came“run-
ning back, and cried, “ O Master! O Master! O sorrow!
O bad !” “ What’s the matter Friday '3" said I. “ O
yonder there,” said he, “ one, two, three! canoe! one,
two, three ! “ Well, Friday, said I, do not be frightened.”
I then took my perspective glass, and went up the side
of the hill, when I saw twenty one savages, three prisoners,
and three canoes. I bid him see what they were doing:
he did so, and told me, that they were all about the re,
eating the esh of one of their prisoners ; and that a beard-
ed man lay bound upon the sand, whom he said they would
kill next.
Ihad not a moment to lose, for two were stooped down
to untie the christian, in order to murder him. _Now said
I, Friday, do as you see me do. I laid the muskets down,
and took one; and then we both red. Three were killed,
and ve wounded. The rest jumped up immediately on
their feet; but knew not where to run.
I resolved to pursue them, and ran to the canoe, calling
to Friday to follow me; but I was no sooner in the canoe,
than I found another poor creature lie there alive, bound
hand and foot. I immediately cut the twisted ags; and
seeing that he had been bound so tight, that he was almost
dead, I gave him a dram, and ordered Friday to tell him of
his deliverance; but when the poor fellow looked in his
face, and heard him speak, it would have moved any one to
tears, to have seen how he kissed, embraced, hugged him,
cried, danced, sung, and then cried again. It was some
time before I could make him tell me what was the matter;
but when he came a little to himself, he said, he was his
own dear father. He then sat down by him, held the old
man's head close to his bosom, and chafed his arms and
ancles, which were stiff with binding.
The Spaniard having expressed to me the utmost
gratitude for his deliverance, gave me an account of his
shipwreck, and the situation of his companions ; and it
was resolved that Friday’s father and the Spaniard, should
goin the boat to fetch them over.
About eight days after they were gone, Friday wakened
me one morning, by crying out “ Master they are come I"
I dressed and hastened to the top of the hill, and plainly
discovered an English ship lying at anchor. '
They ran the boat ashore on the beach, and eleven men
landed, three of them unarmed, who by their gestures
seemed to be prisoners; and one of them I could perceive
using the "most passionate gestures of entreaty, atlliction
and despair, while the two others, tho’ their grief seemed
less extravagant, appeared pleading for mercy. At this
instant I sa.w avillain lift up his arm to kill one of the
prisoners; but he did not strike him. The men having
left the prisoners and gone into the woods, Iwent up to
them with my man Friday, and said to them in Spanish,
what are you gentlemen? they startled at the noise; but
prepared to y. I then said in English, gentlemen, perhaps
ypu may have a friend near you, whom you little expect.
ell me your case. “ I was commander of that ship (re-
plied one of the prisoners,) my men have mutinied against
me, and if they do not murder me, they intend to leave me,
and these two gentlemen ashore in this desolate place
they are but in that thicket, and I tremble for fear they
have seen you.” Having concerted matters with the captain.
and armed ourselves, we went to the sailors, and the captain
reserving his own piece, the two men shot one of the vil-
lains dead, and wounded--‘another. Ile who was woundeu
cried out for help, and I poming up, gave orders for sparing
their lives, on condition‘-of their being bound hand and
feet while they staid in the island.
26 LIFE AND ADVENTURES
A little after another boat came. We fbrmed an
ambuscade, but one of the principal ring-leaders of the
mutiny, with two of the crew coming towards us, the
captain was so eager that he let y, killed two on the spot,
the '1t-hird ran for it. I immediately advanced with my
tvhble army, upon which Will Atkins, one of the ring-
leaders, ‘called out, for God's sake, captain, spare my lite.
The captain told him "he must lay down his arms at ~dis~
dretion, and trust, to the governors mercy, upon which they
allsiibmitted. And with theirassistance we seized .the ship.
'WhenI saw my deliverance thus put into my hands, I
was "ready to sink with surprise; Iwas notable to answer
one word, but a ood of tears brought me to myself, and
alitlle while after l recovered my speech. I then in my
turn embraced him as my deliverer, and we -rejoiced
together. Having brought the prisoners before me, l asked
them what they had to say in their own defence, telling
them I had power to execute them there.
They pleaded the captain’s promise of mercy. Ithen
told them that I intended to go passenger in the ship, with
all my men; but that they, if they went, could only go as
prisoners ; observing however, that they might, if they
chose it, stay in the island. This they gladly accepted, and
I prepared to go on board the next day. The captain re-
turning to the ship, got every thing ready for my reception.
When he was gone, I talked to the men, told" them .my
story, and how I nianaged all my household business; left
a letter for the fteen Spaniards, and made them promise
to treat them in common with themselves. The next day I
went on board the ship, taking Friday with me: thus I left
the island after being on it twenty-eight years, and arrived
safely in England. Sometime afterl went to Lisbon, to
look after my effects in the Brazils, and found the generous
captain, who had been so much my friend, still alive, and
he put me in the way of recovering the produce of my
