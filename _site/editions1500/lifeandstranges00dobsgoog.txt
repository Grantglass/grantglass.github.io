INTRODUCTION. 




PREFACE to Robinfon Crufoe 
has a certain air offuperfluity. The 
fame of the book is Jo well eftabli/hed, 
and its popularity is Jo enduring, 
that one is naturally reminded of the homely 
adage which warns us that " good wine needs no 
bufh." Tet although, in this inftance, criticifm 
is unneceffary, and praife impertinent, it is 
always profitable to remember from what four ce, 
and under w/iat conditions, a time-honoured 
clajjic had its origin. If this be true of any 
literary majlerpiece, it is efpecially true where 
fome particular edition of it is concerned. Here 
it is a fac fimile reprint of the editio princeps ; 
and wejhall, therefore, make no further apology 
for the brief biographico-bibliographical notes 
which follow. 

According to a deprejfing French epigram — 
or rather a French epigram that is deprejjing to 
middle-aged talent — the man who has not fuc- 
ceeded before he is thirty is hopelejjly doomed to . 
failure. Iffuccefs is to be meafured by great eft 
achievements only, and minor efforts are to count 



VI 



for nothing, then Defoe is a Jir iking injiance of 
the fallacy of this diStum. When Robinfon 
Crufoe firjl appeared, its author was in his 
fifty-eighth year, and already a voluminous and 
very various writer. Mr. William Lee, his 
lateft and befl biographer, whofe labours have 
well-nigh made further inquiry unnecejfary, enu- 
merates in his revifed Catalogue of Defoe 9 s 
works no lefs than one hundred and ninety pre- 
decejfors to this— -his befl*known book. Some of 
thefe, it is true, are only pamphlets of two or 
three leaves, but others are bulky volumes. The 
majority are on commercial or political themes ; 
but the lift, taken as a whole, and judged by the 
titles alone, affords an extraordinary idea of the 
Jleeplefs a&ivity and unwearied verfatility of 
the author. It helps us, too, to comprehend from 
what wide referves of experience and what a 
vafi magazine offadls he drew the material for 
Robinfon Crufoe, and thofe lefs-known "fitfions 
in facfimile of nature" which, during the lajl 
decade of his life, followed fo rapidly upon it. 
From the firjl fugitive ^to. Sheet in double 
columns, to which in 1 687 he had configned his 
Reflections on His Majefty's Declaration for 
Liberty of Confcience, down to the Family 
Inftrudtor of ijiS, he had written upon almofi 
every fubjeB that commends it/elf to the curiofity 
of the middle clafs intelligence ; and when in 



Vll 



17 1 9, not long after he had been jlricken with 
apoplexy, he fat down undaunted to add fiStion 
to his current journalifm (which, as Mr. Lee 
has Jhown, he had never relinquijhed, but was 
only conducing clandefiinely), he had accumulated 
an inexhaujlible jtore ofmifcellaneous information. 
His habit of mind had accufiomed him to minute 
and almojl unconfcious jlock^taking, even of the 
trivial and commonplace; and his habit of the pen 
had enabled him to record his imprejfions with 
the mechanical precifion of Renography. He 
could not only " report, 9 in Jhort-hand writers 9 
phrafe, with literal fidelity 9 but, in the abfence 
of anything to report, he could invent a report, 
which Jhould exhibit all the petty negligences, the 
every-day phra/eology f the unlejfoned afpeft, and 
the inartijtic barrennefs of naked truth. Add 
to this a very pronounced mental bias towards 
circumjlantial forgeries like the Minutes of the 
Negotiations of Mons. Mefnager, or matter- 
off aft myfiifications like the True Relation of 
the Apparition of one Mrs. Veal; and we 
have, fuperf daily fpeaking, the qualities which 
produced Robinfon Crufoe. 

// is the inevitable chara&erijtic of a mind of 
this type that we -do not find in it the highefi 
creative gifts. It collects and adjujls rather 
than originates, and its invention is Jhown chiefly 
in the ingenuity of its combinations. As a rule 



Vlll 



it has a tendency to be difconneSled in its opera- 
tions ; but) once fur nifhed with a fitting central 
idea, its ability to fupply detail and fupple- 
ment is practically unlimited. With Robinfon 
Crufoe this favourable germ was an aSlual 
occurrence. In September ; 1704, a certain 
moody and ill-conditioned Alexander Selkirk or 
Selcraigy a failor on board one of Dampier 9 s 
fieet y had quarrelled with his captain, who had 
forthwith " marooned " him, as the phrafe then 
was, upon the defolate ifland of Juan Fernandez. 
Here he lived alone for more than four years , 
being taken off at lafi in February, 1709, by 
Captain Woodes Rogers. He returned to Eng- 
land in 1 7 1 1 , and when Captain Rogers Jhortly 
afterwards publijhed an account of his voyage, 
due mention was made of the interejling caft- 
away whom he had refcued in the Southern Seas. 
Somewhat later, in 171 3, Selkirk was "inter- 
viewed" in London by Steele, who gave an oft- 
reprinted account of his adventures in No. 26 
of the Engliftiman. Whether Defoe, too, faw 
Selkirk in the fiejh is not recorded; but it is 
mofi probable that the fir ft idea of his mafter piece 
came from Steele's paper. 

However this may be, it was not until fome 
years afterwards that Robinfoa Crufoe was 
aSlually publijhed. The date of its iffue by 
William Taylor "at the Ship in Pater-Nofter- 



IX 



Row" was the z$th of April, 17 19; and the 
title, which is accurately reproduced in the 
prefent edition, ran as follows : — The Life and 
Strange Surpriziqg Adventures of Robinfon 
Crufoe, of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight 
and Twenty Years all alone in an un-inha- 
bited Ifland on the Coaft of America, near 
the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; 
Having been caft on Shore by Shipwreck, 
wherein all the Men perifhed but himfelf. 
With An Account how he was at laft as 
ftrangely delivered by Pyrates. Written by 
Himfelf. The volume was an oSiavo of 364 
pages, preface and title (2 leaves) not included, 
and it was embellijhed by a rude copper plate 
{here copied) in which Crufoe is reprefented on the 
fea Jhore with his brace of guns and his bafket- 
hiked fword. At the end were two pages of ad- 
vertifements, from which, as they are to be found 
in the prefent reprint, the reader may judge in 
what curious companion/hip of dramas and fer- 
mons — new editions of Byfshe's Art of Poetry 
and continuations of the Turkifh Spy — the mojl 
popular book of the century made its entry into 
the world. In the "Preface" where Defoe 
mafquerades as Editor, he gravely vouches for 
the authenticity of the narrative. He calls 
attention to the modejly and ferioufnefs with 
which the tale is told; and he lays Jlrefs upon 



its excellent morality. He believes , it {he fays) 

to be " a jujl Hijiory of Fa5l ; neither is there 

any Appearance of FiSlion in it" and he con- 

fders that he does the "World " a great Service 

in the Publication" Its immediate fuccefs 

fhowed that he had not mif calculated. The 

book — as Byron f aid of Graf s Elegy—" pleafed 

inftantly and eternally" Before the middle of 

May j afecond edition was called for. A third 

followed in *June> and a fourth in Augufi. 

With a forethought that was a part of his 
nature* Defoe had not omitted to leave the ways 
open for afequel. "All thefe things" fays Crufoe 
in his concluding lines f u withfome veryfurpriz- 
ing Incidents infome new Adventures of my own* 
for ten Tears more* I may perhaps give a further 
Account of hereafter" From this it is clear 
that the author only waited for the fuccefs of the 
firjl part to prepare afecond; and* by the rapidity 
with which this fecond part was produced* he 
mufl have Jet about it immediately. Only twelve 
days after the iffue of the fourth edition of Fart L 9 
appeared The Farther Adventures of Robinfon 
Crufoe ; Being the Second and Laft Part of 
his Life, and of the Strange Surprizing Ac- 
counts of his Travels round three Parts of the 
Globe. Written by Himfelf. To which is 
added a Map of the World, in which is de- 
lineated the Voyages of Robinfon Crufoe. 



XI 



To this, a volume of 273 P*^* wtt ^ a Title, 
Preface, and Advertijements occupying 4 leaves, 
was prefixed a fomewhat longer announcement 
than that which ushered in Part L Retaining 
his editorial character, Defoe refers with edifying 
complacency to thefuccefs of the preceding volume, 
afuccefs which he attributes $i to the Surprizing 
variety of the Subject, and to the agreeable Man- 
ner of the Performance. All the endeavours of 
envious People {he goes on) to reproach it with 
being a Romance, to fearch it for Errors in 
Geography, Incon/ijiency in the Relation, and 
Contradictions in the Fait, have proved abortive, 
and as impotent as malicious. Thejujt Appli- 
cation of every Incident, the religious and ufeful 
Inferences drawn from every Part, are fo many 
Tejlimonies to the good Defign of mating it 
Publick ; and mujl legitimate all the Part that 
may be call' d Invention, or Par able, in the Story." 
The remainder of the " Preface," which begins 
by promifing that, ("contrary to the Vfage of 
Second Parts") the new volume will be " every 
Way as entertaining as the Firfi," is occupied 
by a protejl againjl an unauthorized abridgment 
of the book which, it appears, had been put forth 
a few days before, from the t( Amfterdam Coffee* 
Hoiife" by a piratical publijher. Defoe's 
unfeigned indignation at this proceeding abnoji 
makes him forget his editorial character. " The 



Xll 



Injury thefe Men do the Proprietor of this Work 
is a PraSiice all honeji Men abhor; and be be- 
lieves he may challenge them tojhew the Diffe- 
rence between that and Robbing on the Highway, 
or Breaking open a Houfe. If they can't Jhew 
any Difference in the Crime, they will find it 
hard to Jhew any Difference in the Punifhment. 
And he will anfwerfor it, that nothing Jhall be 
wanting on his Part, to do them fujlice" 

Defpite the promifes of the Preface, thefecond 
Part of Robinfon Crufoe did not meet with the 
fuccefs of its predecejfor. Had it been equally 
well received, it is not impojfible that Defoe, who 
{unlike Addifon and Cervantes) had been careful 
not to kill his hero, might have difcovered a pre- 
text for afrejh confignment of " fur prizing Ad- 
ventures." As it was, he did attempt to divert 
the inter efi in a new direction by a fupplementary 
volume of Serious Reflections during the Life 
and Surprizing Adventures of Robinfon 
Crufoe : With his Vifion of the Angelick 
World. Written by Himfelf. 1720. The 
book made little or no imprejjion on the public, 
and is now feldom or never affociated with Parts 
I. and II But the Preface, which purports 
to be from the pen of Crufoe himfelf, is even 
of greater interejl than thofe from which we 
have already made extracts. It fpeaks of his 
previous biography as inculcating "invincible 



" ■ '■' ■ ' m ' m i " i^ i 



Xlll 



Patience under the worft qfMifery; indefatigable 
Application and undaunted Refolution under the 
greateft and moft difcouraging Circumftances" 
The ftory, though "Allegorical" is alfo declared 
to be " Hiftorical." " Farther? fays the writer 
{and it mujl be borne in mind that Crufoe is 
fuppofed to be fpeaking), " there is a man alive, 
and well-known too, the Anions of whofe Life 
are the jujl SubjeSt of thefe Volumes, and to 
whom all or moji Part of the Story direSfly 
alludes" Thefe words, taken in connexion with 
other paffages of the fame " Preface " and of 
the book, itfelf have generally been held tofignify 
that, to fome extent, Defoe intended Robinfon 
Crufoe to fymbolize his own folitary and felf 
reliant career. Whether this was a part of 
the original plan, or merely the refult of an 
after -thought, there can be little doubt that in 
his praSlical character, his fortitude, his perfe- 
verance, and moji of the qualities which have 
endeared him and his adventures to fo many 
generations of Engli/hmen, there are manifeft 
affinities between Robinfon Crufoe and his creator, 
Daniel Defoe. 

To give any account of the various forms 

under which Robinfon Crufoe has appeared 

fince its fir ft ijfue in 171 9, would be impojjible 

in this place. But one or two particulars, chiefly 

in reSlification of the earlier biographies, may 



XIV 



be here added. Much debate has taken place 
as to where the book, was aSiually compofed. 
Halifax ', Gate/head in Durham, Whitechapel, 
the village of Hartley in Kent, have all claimed 
this honour. Mr. Lee, however, has Jhown con^ 
clujively that, as his predecejfor Mr. Wilfon 
ajfumed, it was planned and penned in Defoe's 
own houfe at Stoke Newington. Further, it was 
alleged by Chalmers that the MS. went the round 
of the trade before it found a purchafer. Mr. 
Lee was unable to trace anything to fupport this 
Jlatement, which, moreover^ the known talents 
of Defoe make very improbable. Laftly, it was 
for fome time fuppofed that Robinfon Crufoe 
firft appeared in the Original London Poll, or 
Heathcote's Intelligencer. It was in fact 
printed in the journal in quejlion, but the publi- 
cation did not begin until the yth Oftober, 1 7 1 9, 
at which date both the firft and fecond Parts 
had been given to the world in book form.

THE 



THE 



LIFE 

AND 

ADVENTURES 

OF 

Robinson Crusoe, &V. 



Was born in the Year 1632, in the 
City of Tork, of a good Family, tho' 
not of that Country, my Father be- 
ing a Foreigner of Bremen, who fettled 
firft at Hull: He got a good Eftate 
by Merchandife, and leaving off his 
Trade, lived afterward at York, from whence he had 
married my Mother, whofe Relations were named 
Robin/on, a very good Family in that Country, and 
from whom I was called Robin/on Kreutznaer; but by 
the ufual Corruption of Words in England, we are 
now called, nay we call our felves, and write our 
Name Crufoe ,andfo my Companions always call'd me. 
B I had 



[a] 



I had two elder Brothers, one of which was 
Lieutenant Collonel to an Englijh Regiment of Foot 
in Flanders \ formerly commanded by the famous Coll. 
Lockbart, and was killed at the Battle near Dunkirk 
inagaft the Spaniards : What became of my fecond 
Brother I never knew any more than my Father or 
Mother did know what was become of me. 

Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred 
to any Trade, my Head began to be fill'd very 
early with rambling Thoughts:* My Father, who 
was very ancient, had given me a competent Share 
of Learning, as far as Houfe-Education, and a 
Country Free-School generally goes, and defign'd 
me for the Law ; but I would be fatisfied with no- 
thing but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this 
led me fo ftrongly againft the Will, nay the Com- 
mands of my Father, and againft all the Entreaties 
and.Perfwafions of my Mother and other Friends, 
that there feem'd to be fomething fatal in that Pro- 
penfion of Nature tending dire&ly to the Life of 
Mifery which was to befal me. 

My Father, a wife and grave Man, gave me 
lerious and excellent Counfel againft what he fore- 
faw was my Defign. He call'd me one Morning in- 
to his Chamber, where he was confined by the 
Gout, and expoftulated very warmly with me upon 
this Subjeft : He ask'd me what Reafons more than 
a meer wandring Inclination I had for leaving my 
Father's Houfe and my native Country, where I 
might be well introduced, and had a Profpeft 
of raifing my Fortunes by Application and In- 
duftry, with a Life of Eafe and Pleafure. He 
told me it was for Men of defperate Fortunes on 
one Hand, or of afpiring, fuperior Fortunes on the 
other, who went abroad upon Adventures, to rife 
by Enterprize, and make themfelves famous in Un- 
dertakings of a Nature out of the common Road ; 

that 



[3] 



that thefe things were all either too far above me, 
or too far below me ; that mine was the middle 
State, or what might be called the upper Station of 
Low Life, which he had found by long Experience 
was the beft State in the World, the moil (uited to 
human Happinefe, not expofed to the Miferies and 
Hard (hips, the Labour and Sufferings of the me- 
xrhanick Part of Mankind, and not embarafs'd with 
the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the up- 
per Part of Mankind, He told me, I might judge 
of the Happinefs of this State, by this one thing, 
viz. That this was the State of Life which all 
other People envied, that Kings have frequently la- 
mented the miferable Confequences of being born 
to great things, and wifh'd they had been placed 
in the Middle of the two Exremes, between the 
Mean and the Great ; that the wife Man gave his 
Teftimony to this as the juft Standard of true Fe- 
licity, when he prayed to have neither Poverty or 
Riches. 

He bid me obferve it, and I fhould always find, 
that the Calamities of Life were fhared among the 
upper and lower Part of Mankind ; but that the 
middle Station had the feweft Difafters, and was 
not expos'd to fo many Viciflitudes as the higher or 
lower Part of Mankind ; nay, they were not fubje- 
^Sted to fo many Diftempers and Uneafinefles either 
of Body or Mind, as thofe were who, by vicious 
Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand, 
or by hard Labour, Want of Neceflaries, and mean 
or infuflicient Diet on the other Hand, bring Di- 
stempers upon themfelves by the natural Confequen- 
ces of their Way of Living ; That the middle Sta- 
tion of Life was calculated for all kind of Vertues 
and all kinds of Enjoyments; that Peace and Plen- 
ty were the Hand-maids of a middle Fortune ; 
that Temperance, Moderation, Quietnefs, Health, 

B 2 Soci- 



[4] 



Society, all agreeable Diverfions, and all defirabie 
Pleafures, were the Bleflings attending the middle 
Station of Life ; that this Way Men went filently 
and fmoothly thro' the World, and comfortably out 
of it, not embarafs'd with the Labours of the 
Hands or of the Head, not fold to the Life of Slave- 
ry for daily Bread, or harraft with perplex'd Cir- 
omittances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the 
Body of Reft ; not enrag'd with the Paffion of En- 
vy, or lecret burning Lull of Ambition for great 
things; but in eafy Circumftances Aiding gently 
thro' the World, and fenfibly tailing the Sweets of 
living, without the bitter, feeling that they are 
happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to 
know it more fenfibly. 

After this, he prels'd me earneftly, and in the 
moft affe&ionate manner, not to play the young 
Man, not to precipitate myfelf into Miferies which 
Nature and the Station of Life I was born in, 
feem'd to have provided againft ; that I was under 
no Neceflity of feekitig my Bread ; that he would 
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly* 
into the Station of Life which he had been juft re- 
commending to me ; and that if I was not very ea- 
fy and happy in the World, it muft be my meer 
Fate or Fault that muft hinder it, and that he 
lhould have nothing to anfwer for, having thus dif- 
charg'd his Duty in warning me againft Meafures* 
which he knew would be to my Hurt: In a 
word, that as he would do very kind things for me 
if I would ftay and fettle at Home as he direfted, 
fo he would not have fo much Hand in my Misfor- 
tunes, as to give me any Encouragement to go> 
away : And to clofe all, he told me I had my 
elder Brother for an Example, to whom he had ufed 
the fame earneft Perfwafions to keep him from go- 
ing into the Low Country Wars, but could not pre-

vail, his young Defires prompting him to run into 
the Army where he was kill'd ; and tho' he faid 
he would not ceafe to pray for me, yet he would 
venture to fay to me, that if I did take this foolifh 
Step, God would not blefs me, and I would have 
Leifure hereafter to refled: upon having negle&ed 
his Counfel when there might be none to aflift in 
my Recovery. 

I obferved in this laft Part of his Difcourfe, 
which was truly Prophetick, tho' I fuppofe my 
Father did not know it to be fo himfelf ; I fay, I ob- 
ferved the Tears run down his Face very plentiful- 
ly, and efpecially when he fpoke of my Brother who 
was kill'd ; and that when he fpoke of my having 
Leifure to repent, and none to aflift me, he was fo 
mov'd, that he broke off the Difcourfe, and told 
me, his Heart was fo full he could fay no more 
to me. 

I was finqerely affedied. with this Difcourfe, as 
indeed who could be otherwife ; and I refolv'd not 
to think of going abroad any more , but to 
fettle at home according to my Father's Defire. 
But alas! a few Days wore it all off; and in fhort, 
to prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities, 
in a few Weeks after, I refolv'd to run quite away 
from him. However, I did not aft fo haftily neither 
-as my firft Heat of Refolution prompted, but I took 
my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little 
pleafanter than ordinary, and told her, that my 
Thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeing the 
World, that I fhould never fettle to any thing 
with Refolution enough to go through with it, and 
any Father had better give me his Confent than force 
me to go without it ; that I was now Eighteen 
Years old, which was too late to go Apprentice to 
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney ; that I was fure 
if I did, I fhould never ferve out my time, and I 

B 3 fhould 



[6] 



fhould certainly run away from my Matter before 
my Time was out, and go to Sea ; and if flie would 
fpeak to my Father to let me go but one Voyage a- 
broad, if I came home again and did not like it, I 
would go no more, and I would promife by a double 
Diligence to recover that Time I had loft. 

This put my Mother into a great Paffion: She told 
me, fhe knew it would be to no Purpofe to fp^ak 
to my Father upon any fuch Subject ; that he knew 
too well what was my Intereft to give his Confent to 
any thing fo much for my Hurt, and that ftie wonde- 
red how I could think of any fuch thing after fuch a 
Difcourfe as I had had with my Father, and fuch 
kind and tender Expreffions is fhe knew my Father 
had us'd to me ; and that in fhort, if I would ruine 
my felf there was no Help for me ; but I might de- 
pend I fhould never have their Confent to it : That 
for her Part fhe would not have fo much Hand in my 
Deftruction ; and I fhould never have it to fay, that 
my Mother was willing when my Father was not. 

Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Fa- 
ther, yet as I have heard afterwards, fhe reported 
all the Difcourfe to him, and that my Father, after 
fhewing a great Concern at it, faid to her with a 
Sigh, That Boy might be happy if he would ftay 
at home, but if he goes abroad he will be the mi- 
ferableft Wretch that was ever born : I can give no 
Confent to it. 

It was not till almoft a Year after this that I broke 
loofe, tho' in the mean time I continued obftinate- 
ly deaf to all Propofals of fettling to Bufinefs, 
and frequently expoftulating with my Father and 
Mother, about their being fo pofitively determin'd 
againft what they knew my Inclinations prompted 
me to. But being one Day at/fa//, where I went 
cafually, and without any Purpofe of making an 
Elopement that time ; but I fay, being there, and

one of my Companions being going by Sea to London, 
in his Father's Ship, and prompting me to go with 
them, with the common Allurement of Seafaring 
Men, viz. That it ihould coft me nothing for my 
Paffage, I confulted neither Father or Mother any 
more, nor fo much as fent them Word of it ; but leav- 
ing them to hear of it as they might, without asking 
God's Bleffing, or my Father's, without any Con- 
fideration of Circumftances or Confequences, and 
in an ill Hour, God knows. On the firft of Septem- 
ber 1 66 1 1 went on Board a Ship bound for London; 
never any young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I be- 
lieve, began (boner, or continued longer than mine. 
The Ship was no fooner gotten out of the Hum- 
ber, but the Wind began to blow, and the Winds to 
rife in a moil frightful manner ; and as I had ne- 
ver been at Sea before, I was moft inexpreffibly fick 
in Body, and terrify'd in my Mind : I began now feri- 
oufly to refledb upon what I had done, and how juft- 
ly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for 
my wicked leaving my Father's Houfe, and aban- 
doning my Duty ; all the good Counfel of my Pa- 
rents, my Father's Tears and my Mother's En- 
treaties came now frefti into my Mind, and my 
Confidence, which was not yet come to the Pitch 
of Hardnefs which it has been fince, reproach'd 
me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach 
of my Duty to God and my Father. 

All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea, 
which I had never been upon before, went very high, 
tho' nothing like what I have feen many times 
fince ; no, nor like what I faw a few Days after : 
But it was enough to affedt me then, who was but 
a young Sailor, and had never known any thing of 
the matter. I expe&ed every Wave would have 
fwallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell 
down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollow 

B4 of 



[8] 



of the Sea, we ftiould never rife more ; and in this 
Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Refolu- 
tions, that if it would pleafe God here to fpare 
my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my 
Foot upon dry Land again, I would go dire&ly 
home to my Father, and never fet it into a Ship a- 
gain while I liv'd ; that I would take his Advice, 
and never run my felf into fuch Miferies as thefe a- 
ny more. Now I faw plainly the Goodnefs of his 
Obfervations about the middle Station of Life, 
how eafy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his 
Days, and never had been expos'd to Tempefts at 
Sea, or Troubles on Shore ; and I refolv'd that I 
would, like z, true repenting Prodigal, go home to 
my Father. 

Thefe wife and fober Thoughts continued all the 
while the Storm continued, and indeed fome 
time after ; but the next Day the Wind was aba- 
ted and the Sea calmer, and I began to be a little 
inur'd to it : However 1 was very grave for all that 
Day, being alfo a little Sea fick ftill ; but towards 
Night the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite 
over, and a charming fine Evening follow'd ; the 
Sun went down perfectly clear and rofe fo the next 
Morning; and having little or no Wind and a 
fmooth Sea, the Sun mining upon it, the Sight was, 
as I thought, the moft delightful that ever I faw. 

I had flept well in the Night, and was now no 
more Sea fick but very chearful, looking with 
Wonder upon the Sea that was fo rough and terri- 
ble the Day before, and could be fo calm and fo 
pleafant in fo little time after. And now leaft my 
good Refolutions ftiould continue, my Companion, 
who had indeed entic'd me away, comes to me, 
Well Bob, fays he, clapping me on the Shoulder, 
How do you do after it ? I warrant you were frighted, 
wa'n't you> laft Night, when it blew but a Cap full of 

Wind; 



[9] 



Wind? A Cap full cTyou call it? faid I, 'twas a terri- 
ble Storm : A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, do you 
call that a Storm why it was nothing at all; give us but 
a good Ship and Sea Room, and we think nothing of/uch 
a Squal of Wind as that ; but you're but afrejh Water 
Sailor, Bob ; come let us make a Bowl of Punch and 
we' 11 forget all that, d'ye fee what charming Weather' t is 
now. To make ftiort this fad Part of my Story, 
we went the old way of all Sailors, the Punch was 
made, and I was made drunk with it, and in that 
one Night's Wickednefs I drowned all my Repen- 
tance, all my Reflexions upon my paft Conduft, 
and all my Refolutions for my future. In a word, 
as the Sea was returned to its Smoothnefs of Sur- 
face and fettled Calmnefs by the Abatement of that 
Storm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over, 
my Fears and Apprehenfions of being fwallow'd up 
by the Sea being forgotten, and the Current of 
my former Defires return'd, I entirely forgot the 
Vows and Promifes that I made in my Diftrefs. I 
found indeed fbme Intervals of Refle&ion, and the 
ferious Thoughts did, as it were endeavour to re- 
turn again fometimes, but I (hook them off, and 
rouz'd my felf from them as it were from a Di- 
ftemper, and applying my felf to Drink and Com- 
pany, foon mafter'd the Return of thofe Fits, for 
fo I call'd them, and I had in five or fix Days got as 
compleat a Vidtory over Confcience as any young, 
Fellow that refolv'd not to be troubled with it, 
could defire : But I was to have anothet Trial for 
it ftill ; and Providence, as in fuch Cafes generally it 
does, refojved to leave me entirely without Excufe. 
For if I would not take this for a Deliverance, the 
next was to be fuch a one as the worft and moft 
Wretch among us would confefs both the harden'd 
Danger and the Mercy. 

The 



[10] 



The fixth Day of our being at Sea we came in- 
to Yarmouth Roads ; the Wind having been contrary, 
and the Weather calm, we had made but little Way 
fince the Storm. Here we were obliged to come to 
an Anchor, and here we lay, the Wind continuing 
contrary, viz. at South-weft, for feven or eight 
Days, during which time a great many Ships from 
Newcajile came into the fame Roads, as the com- 
mon Harbour where the Ships might wait, for a 
Wind for the River. 

We had not however rid here fo long, but ftiould 
have Tided it up the River, but that the Wind 
blew too frefli ; and after we had lain four or five 
Days, blew very hard. However, the Roads be- 
ing reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Ancho- 
rage good, and our Ground-Tackle very ftrong, 
our Men were unconcerned, and not in the leaft ap- 
prehenfive of Danger, but fpent the Time in Reft 
and Mirth, after the manner of the Sea ; but the 
eighth Day in the Morning, the Wind increafed, 
and we had all Hands at Work to ftrike our Top- 
Mafts, and make everything fnug and clofe, that 
the Ship might ride as eafy as poffible. By Noon 
the Sea went very high indeed, and our Ship rid 
Forecaftle in, fhipp'd feveral Seas, and we thought 
once or twice our Anchor had come home ; upon 
which our Matter order 'd out the Sheet Anchor; fo 
that we rode with two Anchors a-Head, and the 
Cables vered out to the better End. 

By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed , 
and now I began to fee Terror and Amazement in 
the Faces even of the Seamen themfelves.^ The Ma- 
tter, tho' vigilent to the Bufinefs of preferving the 
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabbin by 
me, I could hear him foftly to himfelf fay feveral 
times, Lord be merciful to us, wejhall be all loft> we 
/hall be all undone ; and the like. During thefe firft 

Hur- 



[»] 



Hurries, I was ftupid, lying ftill in my Cabbin, 
which was in the Steerage, and cannot defcribe my 
Temper : I could ill re-aflume the firft Penitence* 
which I had fo apparently trampled upon, and har- 
den'd my felf againft : I thought the Bitternefs of 
Death had been paft, and that this would be no- 
thing too like the firft. But when the Matter him- 
felf came by me, as I faid juft now, and faid we 
fhould be all loft, I was dreadfully frighted : I got 
up out of my Cabbin, and look'd out; but fuch a 
difmal Sight I never faw : The Sea went Mountains 
high, and broke upon us every three or four Mi- 
nutes: when I could look about, I could fee 
nothing but Diftrefs round us : Two Ships that 
rid near us we found had cut their Mafts ,by the 
Board, being deep loaden; and our Men cry'dout, 
that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Head of us 
was foundered. Two more Ships being driven from 
their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea at 
all Adventures, and that with not a Maft (landing. 
The light Ships fared the beft, as not fb much la- 
bouring in the Sea ; but two or three of them drove, 
and came clofe by us, running away with only their 
Sprit-fail out before the Wind. 

Towards Evening the Mate and Boat-Swain 
begg'd the Mafter of our Ship to let th6m cut away 
the Foremaft, which he was very unwilling to : But 
the Boat-Swain protefting to him, that if he did 
not, the Ship would founder, he contented; and 
when they had cut away the Foremaft, the Main- 
Maft flood fo loofe, and ftiook the Ship fo much, 
they were obliged to cut her away alfo, and make a 
clear Deck. 

Any one may judge what a Condition I muft be 
in at all this, who was but a young Sailor ; and 
who had been in fuch a Fright before at but a lit- 
tle. But if I can exprefs at this Diftance the 

Thoughts 



[12] 



Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was iti 
tenfold more Horror of Mind upon Account of my 
former Convi&ions, and the having returned from 
them to the Refolutions I had wickedly taken at firft, 
than I was at Death it felf ; and thefe added to the 
Terror of the Storm, put me into fuch a Condition, 
that I can by no Words defcribe it. But the worft 
was not come yet, the Storm continued with fuch 
•Fury, that the Seamen themfelves acknowledged 
they had never known a worfe. We had a good Ship, 
'but fhe was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, 
that the Seamen every now and then cried out, ih e 
would founder. It was my Advantage in one refpeft, 
that I did not know what they meant by Founder, 
till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was fo vio- 
lent, that I faw what is not often feen, the Mafter, 
the Boat-Swain, and fome others more fenfible than 
the reft, at their Prayers, and expediting every Mo- 
ment when the Ship would go to the Bottom. In 
the Middle of the Night, and under all the reft of 
*bf our Diftrefles, one of the Men that had been 
down on Purpofe to fee, cried out we had fprung a 
Leak ; another faid there was four Foot Water in 
the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump. 
At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, died 
within me, and I fell backwards upon the Side of 
my Bed where I fat, into the Cabbin. However, 
the Men roufed me, and told me, that I that was 
able to do nothing before, was as well able to 
pump as another; at which I ftirr'd up, and went 
to the Pump and wprk'd very heartily. While this 
was doing, the Mafter feeing fome light Colliers, 
who not able to ride out the Storm, were oblig'd 
to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near 
tis, ordered to fire a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs. I 
who knew nothing what that meant, was fo furpri- 
fed, that I thought the Ship had broke, or fome 

dread- 



['3] 



dreadful thing had happen'd . In a word, I was fa 
furprifed, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was 
a time when every Body had his own Life to think 
of, no Body minded me, or tohat was become of 
me ; but another Man ftept up to the Pump, and 
thrufting me afide with his Foot, let me lye, thin- 
king I had been dead ; and it was a great while 
before I came to my felf. 

We work'd on, but the Water encreafing in the 
Hold, it was apparent that the Ship would founder, 
and tho* the Storm began to abate a little, yet as 
it was not poflible fhe could fwim till we might run 
into a Port, fo the Matter continued firing Guns 
for Help ; and a light Ship who had rid it out juft a 
Head of us ventured a Boat out to help us. It was 
with the utmoft Hazard the Boat came near us, 
but it was impoflible for us to get on Board, or for 
the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at laft the 
Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives 
to fave ours, our Men caft them a Rope over the 
Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great 
Length, which they after great Labour and Ha- 
zard took hold of and we hall'd them clofe under 
our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to 
no Purpofe for them or us after we were in the 
Boat to think of reaching to their own Ship, fo all 
agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in to- 
wards Shore as much as we could, and our Mailer 
promifed them, That if the Boat tras ftdv'd upon 
Shore he would make it good to their Matter, fo 
partly rowing and partly driving our Boat went a- 
way to the Norward floaping towards the Shore 
almoft as far as Winterton Nefs. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an 
Hour out of our Ship but we faw her fink, and 
then I underftood for the firft time what was meant 
by a Ship foundering in the Sea ; I mutt acknow- 
ledge 



[H] 



ledge I had hardly Eyes to look up when the Sea- 
men told me fhe was finking ; for from that Mo- 
ment they rather put me into the Boat than that I 
might be faid to go in, my Heart was as it were 
dead within me, partly with Fright, partly with 
Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what was 
yet before me. 

While we were in this Condition, the Men yet 
labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat near the 
Shore, we could fee, when our Boat mounting the 
Waves, we were able to fee the Shore, a great 
many People running along the Shore to aflift us 
when we fhould come near, but we made but flow 
way towards the Shore, nor were we able to reach 
the Shore, till being paft the Light-Houfe at Win- 
terton y the Shore falls off to the Weftward towards 
Cromer, and fo the Land broke off a little the Violence 
of the Wind : Here we got in, and tho' not with- 
out much Difficulty got all fafe on Shore and walk'd 
afterwards on Foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfor- 
tunate Men, we were ufed with great Humanity as 
well by the Magiftrates of the Town, who affign'd 
us good Quarters, as by particular Merchants and 
Owners of Ships, and had Money given us fuffi- 
cient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as 
we thought fit. 

Had I now had the Senfe to have gone back to 
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and 
my Father, an Emblem of our Bleffed Saviour's 
Parable, had even kilTd the fatted Calf for me ; 
for hearing the Ship I went away in was caft away 
in Tar mouth Road, it was a great while before he 
had any Affurance that I was not drown'd. 

But my ill Fate pufli'd me on now with an Ob- 
ftinacy that nothing could refift ; and tho' I had fe- 
veral times loud Calls from my Reafon and my 
more compofed Judgment to go home, yet I had 

no 



[is] 



no Power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor 
will I urge, that it is a fecret over-ruling Decree 
that hurries us on to be the Inftruments of our own 
Deftrudtion, even tho' it be before us, and that we 
rufh upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly no- 
thing but fome fuch decreed unavoidable Mifery 
attending, and which it was impoffible for me to 
efcape, could have pufh'd me forward againft the 
calm Reafbnings and Perfwafions of my mod re- 
tired Thoughts, and againft two fuch vifible In- 
ftruftions as I had met with in my firft Attempt. 

My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me be- 
fore, and who was the Matter's Son, was now lefs 
forward than I ; the firft time he fpoke to me after 
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or 
three Days, for we were feparated in the Town 
to feveral Quarters ; I fay, the firft time he faw me, 
it appeared his Tone was alter'd, and looking very 
melancholy and ihaking his Head, ask'd me how 
I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how 
I had come this Voyage only for a Trial in order 
to go farther abroad ; his Father turning to me 
with a very grave and concern'd Tone, Young Man, 
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought 
to take this for a plain and vifible Token that you are 
not to be a Seafaring Man , why, Sir, faid I, will you 
go to Sea no more ? That is another Cafe, faid he, 
it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty ; but as you made 
this Voyage for a Trial,youfee what a Tafte Heaven has 
given you of what you are to expeSt ifou perjift; perhaps 
this is all befallen us on your Account, like Jonah in the 
Ship of TarfhiQi. Pray, continues he, what are you? 
and on what Account did you go to Sea ? Upon that I 
told him fome of my Story ; at the End of which he 
burft out with a ftrange kind of Paffion, What had 
I done, fays he, that fuch an unhappy Wretch ihould 
come into my Ship ? I would not fet my Foot in 

the 



,[i6] 



the fame Ship with thee again for a Thoufand 
Pounds. This indeed was, as I faid, an Excurfion 
of his Spirits which were yet agitated by the Senfe 
of his Lofs, and was farther than he could have 
Authority to go. However he afterwards talk'd very 
gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my Fa- 
ther, and not tempt Providence to my Ruine ; told 
me I might fee a vifible Hand of Heaven againft 
me, And young Man, faid he, depend upon it, if you 
do not go back y wbere-everyou go y you will meet with no- 
thing but D if afters andDif appointments till your Fathers 
Words are fulfilled upon you. 

We parted foon after; for I made him little 
Anfwer, and I faw him no more ; which way he 
went, I know not. As for me, having fome Mo- 
ney in my Pocket> I travelled to London by Land ; 
and there, as well as on the Road, had many Strug- 
gles with my felf, what Courfe of Life I ftiould take, 
and whether I ftiould go Home, or go to Sea. 

As to going Home, Shame oppofed the beft 
Motions that offered to my Thoughts ; and it im- 
mediately occurr'd to me how I mould be laugh'd 
at among the Neighbours, and ftiould be aftiam'd 
to fee, not my Father and Mother only, but even 
every Body elfe ; from whence I have fince often 
obferved, how incongruous and irrational the com- 
mon Temper of Mankind is, efpecially of Youth, 
to that Reafon which ought to guide them in fuch 
Cafes, viz. That they are not aftiam'd to fin, and 
yet are aftiam'd to repent ; not aftiam'd of the Acti- 
on for which they onght juftly to be efteemed Fools, 
but are aftiam'd of the returning, which only can 
make them be efteem'd wife Men. 

In this State of Life however I remained fbme 
time, uncertain what Meafures to take, and what 
Courfe of Life to lead. An irrefiftible Rel usance 
continu'd to going Home ; and as I ftay'd a while, 

the 



[17] 

the Remembrance of the Diftrefs I had been in 
wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I 
had in my Defires to a Return wore off with it, till 
at laft I quite lay'd afide the Thoughts of it, and 
lookt out for a Voyage. 

That evil Influence which carry ed me firft away 
from my Father's Houfe, that hurried me into the 
wild and indigefted Notion of railing my Fortune ; 
and that impreft thofe Conceits fo forcibly upon 
me, as to make me deaf to all good Advice, and 
to the Entreaties and even Command of my Fa- 
ther : I fay the fame Influence, whatever it was, 
prefented the moft unfortunate of all Enterprifes 
to my View ; and I went on board a Veflel bound to 
the Coaft of Africa ; or, as our Sailors vulgarly 
call it, a Voyage to Guinea. 

It was my great Misfortune that in all thefe 
Adventures I did not fhip my felf as a Sailor ; 
whereby, tho' I might indeed have workt a little 
harder than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had 
learn'd the Duty and Office of a Fore-maft Man ; 
and in time might have quallified my felf for a 
Mate or Lieutenant, if not for a Matter : But as 
it was always my Fate to choofe for the worfe, 
fo I did here ; for having Money in my Pocket, 
and good Cloaths upon my Back, I would always 
go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman ; and fo 
I neither had any Bufinefs in the Ship, or learn'd to 
do any. 

It was my Lot firft of all to fall into pretty good 
Company in London, which does not always hap- 
pen to fuch loofe and unguided young Fellows as I 
then was ; the Devil generally not omitting to lay 
fome Snare for them very early : But it was not fo 
with me, I firft fell acquainted with the Mafter of 
a Ship who had been on the Coaft of Guinea ; and 
who having had very good Succefs there, was re- 

C folved 



[i8] 

folved to go again ; and who taking a Fancy to my 
Converfation, which was not at all difagreeable at 
that time, hearing me fay I had a mind to fee the 
Word, told me if I wou'd go the Voyage with 
him I fhould be at no Expence ; I fliould be his 
Mefs-mate and his Companion, and if I could 
carry any thing with me, I fhould have all the 
Advantage of it that the Trade would admit ; and 
perhaps I might meet with fome Encouragement. 

I embrac'd the Offer, and entring into a ftrift 
Friendfhip with this Captain, who was an honeft 
and plain-dealing Man, I went the Voyage with 
him, and carried a fmall Adventure with me, which 
by the difinterefted Honefty of my Friend the Cap- 
tain, I increafed very considerably ; for I carried 
about 40 /. in fuch Toys and Trifles as the Cap- 
tain dire&ed me to buy. This 40 /. I had mufte- 
red together by the Affiftance of fome of my Rela- 
tions whom I correfponded with, and who, I be- 
lieve, got my Father, or at leaft my Mother, to 
contribute fo much as that to my firft Adventure. 

This was the only Voyage which I may fay was 
fuccefsful in all my Adventures, and which I owe to 
the Integrity and Honefty of my Friend the Cap- 
tain, under whom alfo I got a competent Know- 
ledge of the Mathematicks and the Rules of Na- 
vigation, learn'd how to keep an Account of the 
Ship's Courfe, take an Obfervation ; and in fhort, 
to underftand fome things that were needful to be un- 
der ftood by a Sailor: For, as he took Delight to 
introduce me, I took Delight to learn ; and, in a 
word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a 
Merchant: for I brought Home L. 5. 9 Ounces of 
Gold Duft for my Adventure, which yielded me in 
London at my Return, almoft 300 /. and this filPd 
me with thofe afpiring Thoughts which have fince 
fo compleated my Ruin. 

Yet 



[i9l 

Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes 
too ; particularly, that I was continually fick, be- 
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the exceffive 
Heat of the Climate ; our principal Trading being 
upon the Coaft, from the Latitude of 1 5 Degrees, 
North even to the Line it felf. 

I was now fet up for a Guiney Trader ; and my 
Friend, to my great Misfortune, dying foon after his 
Arrival, I refolved to go the fame Voyage again, 
and I embark'd in the fame Veflel with one who was 
his Mate in the former Voyage, and had now got 
the Command of the Ship. This was the unhap- 
pieft Voyage that ever Man made ; for tho' I did 
not carry quite 100 /. of my new gain'd Wealth, 
fo that I had 200 left, and which I lodg'd with 
my Friend's Widow, who was very juft to me, yet 
I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage ; and 
the firft was this, viz. Our Ship making her Courfe 
towards the Canary Iflands, or rather between thofe 
Iflands and the African Shore, was furprifed in the 
Grey of the Morning, by a Turkijh Rover of Sallee, 
who gave Chafe to us with all the Sail fhe could 
make. We crowded alfo as much Canvafs as our 
Yards would fpread, or our Mafts carry, to have 
got clear ; but finding the Pirate gain'd upon us, 
and would certainly come up with us in a few 
Hours, we prepar'd to fight ; our Ship having 1 2 
Guns, and the Rogue 1 8. About three in the Af- 
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing to by 
Miftake, juft athwart our Quarter, inftead of 
athwart our Stern, as he intended, we brought 8 of 
our Guns to. bear on that Side, and pour'd in a 
Broadfide upon him, which made him fheer off 
again, after returning our Fire, and pouring in alfo 
his fmall Shot from near 200 Men which he had on 
Board. However, we had not a Man touch'd, all 
our Men keeping clofe. He prepar'd to attack us 

C 2 again 



[ ao ] 

again, and we to defend our felves ; but laying us 
on Board the next time upon our other Quarter, 
he entred 60 Men upon our Decks, who imme- 
diate! fell to cutting and hacking the Decks and 
Rigging. We ply'd them with Small-fhot, Half- 
Pikes, Powder-Chefts, and fuch like, and clear'd 
our Deck of them twice. However, to cut fhort 
this melancholly Part of our Story, our Ship being 
difabled, and three of our Men kilPd, and eight 
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car- 
ry 'd all Prifoners into «W/**,aPort belonging to the 
Moors. 

The Ufage I had there was not fo dreadful as at 
firft I apprehended, nor was I carried up the Coun- 
try to the Emperor's Court, as the reft of our Men 
were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover, 
as his proper Prize, and made his Slave, being 
young and nimble, and fit for his Bufinefs. At this 
furprifing Change of my Circumftances from a Mer- 
chant to a miferable Slave, I was perfeftly over- 
whelmed ; and now I look'd back upon my Father's 
prophetick Difcourfe to me, that I fhould be mife- 
rable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought 
was now fo effectually brought to pafs, that it could 
not be worfe ; that now the Hand of Heaven had 
overtaken me, and I was undone without Redem- 
ption. But alas ! this was but a Tafte of the Mife- 
ry I was to go thro', as will appear in the Sequel 
of this Story. 

As my new Patron or Mafter had taken me Home 
to his Houfe, fo I was in hopes that he would 
take me with him when he went to Sea again, be- 
lieving that it would fome time or other be his 
Fate to be taken by a Spanijh or Portugal Man of 
War; and that then I fhould be fet at Liberty. But 
this Hope of mine was fbon taken away ; for when 
he went to Sea, he left me on Shoar to look after his 

little 



[21] 

little Garden, and do the common Drudgery of Slaves 
about his Houfe ; and when he came home again 
from his Cruife, he ordered me to lye in the Cab- 
bin to look after the Ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my Efcape ; and 
what Method I might take to effeft it, but found 
no Way that had the leaft Probability in it : No- 
thing prefented to make the Supposition of it ratio- 
nal ; for I had no Body to communicate it to, that 
would embark with me ; no Fellow-Slave, no Eng- 
lijbman, Irijhman, or Scot/man there but my felf ; fo 
that for two Years, tho' I often pleafed my felf with 
the Imagination, yet I never had the leaft encoura- 
ging Profpeft of putting it in Praftice. 

After about two Years an odd Circumftance pre- 
fented it felf, which put the old Thought of. ma- 
king fome Attempt for my Liberty, again in my 
Head : My Patron lying at Home longer than ufu- 
al, without fitting out his Ship, which, as I heard, 
was for want of Money ; he ufed conftantly, once or 
twice a Week, fometimes oftner, if the Weather 
was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and go out into 
the Road a-fifhing ; and as he always took me and 
a young Marefco with him to row the Boat, we 
made him very merry, and I prov'd very dexterous 
in catching Fiih; infomuch that fometimes he 
would fend me with a Moor, one of his Kinf- 
men, and the Youth the Marefco, as they calPd him, 
to catch a Difh of Fifti for him. 

It happened one time, that going a fifhing in a 
ftark calm Morning, a Fog rofe fo thick, that tho* 
we were not half a League from the Shoar we loft 
Sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or 
which way, we labour'd all Day and all the next 
Night, and when the Morning came we found we 
had pull'd off to Sea inftead of pulling in for the 
Shoar ; and that we were at leaft two Leagues from 

C 3 the 



[aa] 

the Shoar : However we got well in again, tho' 
with a great deal of Labour, and fome Danger; 
for the Wind began to blow pretty frefh in the Mor- 
ning ; but particularly we were all very hungry. 

But our Patron warn'd by this Difafter, refolved 
to take more Care of himfelf for the future ; and 
having lying by him the Long-boat of our Englijh 
Ship we had taken, he refolved he would not go a 
fifhing any more without a Compafs and tome 
Provision; fo he ordered the Carpenter of his 
Ship, who alfo was an Englijh Slave, to build a 
little State-room or Cabin in the middle of the Long 
Boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place to ftand 
behind it to fteer and hale home the Main-fheet ; 
and Room before for a hand or two to ftand and 
work the Sails ; (he faiPd with that we call a Shoul- 
der of Mutton Sail ; and the Boom gib'd over the 
Top of the Cabbin, which lay very fnug and low, 
and had in it Room for him to lye, with a Slave 
or two, and a Table to eat on, with fome fmall 
Lockers to put in fome Bottles of fuch Liquor as he 
thought fit to drink in; particularly his Bread, 
Rice and Coffee. 

We went frequently out with this Boat a fifhing, 
and as I was moft dextrous to catch fifh for him, 
he never went without me : It happen'd that he 
had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for 
Pleafure or for Fifh, with two or three Moors of 
fome Diftin&ion in that Place, and for whom he 
had provided extraordinarily ; and had therefore 
fent on board the Boat over Night, a larger Store 
of Provisions than ordinary ; and had order'd me 
to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot, 
which were on board his Ship ; for that they de- 
fign'd fome Sport of Fowling as well as Fifhing. 

I got all things ready as he had dire&ed, and 
waited the next Morning with the Boat, wafhed 

clean, 



[»3] 

clean, her Antient and Pendants out, and every 
thing to accomodate his Guefts ; when by and by 
my Patroon came on board alone, and told me 
his Guefts had put off going, upon fome Bufinefs 
that fell out, and order'd me with the Man and 
Boy, as ufual, to go out with the Boat and catch 
them fome Fifh, for that his Friends were to fup 
at his Houfe ; and commanded that as foon as I 
had got fome Fifti I ihould bring it home to his 
Houfe ; all which I prepar'd to do. 

This Moment my former Notions of Deliver- 
ance darted into my Thoughts, for now I found I 
was like to have a little Ship at my Command ; and 
my Mafter being gone, I prepar'd to furnifti my 
felf, not for a fifhing Bufinefs but for a Voyage ; 
tho' I knew not, neither did I fo much as confider 
whither I fhould fteer; for any where to get out 
of that Place was my Way. 

My firft Contrivance was to make a Pretence 
to fpeak to this Moor, to get fomething for our Sub- 
fiftance on board ; for I told him we muft not pre- 
fume to eat of our Patroon's Bread, he fa?d that 
was true ; fo he brought a large Basket of Rusk 
or Bisket of their kind, and three Jarrs with frefh 
Water into the Boat ; I knew where my Patroon's 
Cafe of Bottles ftood, which it was evident by 
the make were taken out of fome Englijh Prize ; and 
I convey'd them into the Boat while the Moor was 
on Shoar, as if they had heen there before, for our 
Mafter: I convey'd alfo a great Lump of Bees- 
Wax into the Boat, which weighed above half 
a Hundred Weight, with a Parcel of Twine 
or Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw and a Hammer, all 
which were of great Ufe to us afterwards ; espe- 
cially the Wax to make Candles. Another Trick 
I try'd upon him, which he innocently came into 
alfo ; his Name was Ifmael, who they call Muly 

C 4 or 



I Ml 



or Moely, fo I call'd to him, Moely faid I, our Pa- 
troon's Guns are on board the Boat, can you not 
get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may 
kill fome Alcamies (a Fowl like ourCurlieus) for our 
felves, for I know he keeps the Gunner's Storesin the 
Ship? Y&Jays he, Til bring fome, and accordingly he 
brought a great Leather Pouch which held about a 
Pound and half of Powder, or rather more ; and ano- 
ther with Shot, that had five or fix Pound, with fome 
Bullets ; and put all into the Boat : At the fame time 
I had found fome Powder of my Matters in the Great 
Cabbin, with which I fill'd one of the large Bot- 
tles in the Cafe, which was almoft empty ; pou- 
ring what was in it into another : and thus furnifh- 
ed with every thing needful, we fail'd out of 
the Port to fifh : The Caftle which is at the En- 
trance of the Port knew who we were, and took 
no Notice of us ; and we were not above a Mile 
out of the Port before we haPd in our Sail, and fet 
us down to fifh : The Wind blew from the N.NE. 
which was contrary to my Defire ; for had it blown 
foutherly I had been fure to have made the Coaft 
of Spain, and at leaft reacht to the Bay of Cadiz ; 
but my Refolutions were, blow which way it would, 
I would be gone from that horrid Place where I 
was, and leave thereft to Fate. 

After we had fifht fome time and catcht nothing, 
for when I had Fifh on my Hook, Iwould not pull 
them up, that he might not fee them ; I faid to 
the Moor, this will not do, our Mafter will not 
be thus ferv'd, we muft ftand farther off: He think- 
ing no harm agreed, and being in the head of the 
Boat fet the Sails ; and as I had the Helm I run 
the Boat out near a League farther, and then 
brought her too as if I would fifti ; when giving 
the Boy the Helm, I ftept forward to where the 
Moor was, and making as if I ftoopt for fome- 

thing 



[a S] 

thing hehind him, I took him by Surprize with 
my Arm under his Twift, and toft him clear o- 
ver-board into the Sea ; he rife immediately, for 
he fwam like a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd to be 
taken in, told me he would go all over the World 
with me ; he fwam fo ftrong after the Boat that he 
would have reacht me very quickly, there bieng but 
little Wind ; upon which I ftept into the Cabbin 
and fetching one of the Fowling-pieces, I prefented 
it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt, 
and if he would be quiet I would do him none ; but 
faid I, you fwim well enough to reach to the 
Shoar, and the Sea is calm, make the beft of your 
Way to Shoar and I will do you no harm, but if 
you come near the Boat Til fhoot you thro' the 
Head ; for I am refolved to have my Liberty ; fo 
he turn'd himfelf about and fwam for the Shoar, 
and I make no doubt but he reacht it with Eafe, 
for he was an Excellent Swimmer. 

I could ha' been content to ha' taken this Moor 
with me, and ha' drown'd the Boy, but there was no 
venturing to truft him : When he was gone I turn'd 
to the Boy, who they call'd Xury, and faid to 
him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll make 
you a great Man, but if you will not ftroak your 
Face to be true to me, that is^Jwear by Mahomet and 
his Father's Beard, I muft throw you into the Sea 
• too ; the Boy fmil'd in my Face and fpoke fo inno- 
cently that I could not miftruft him ; and fwore to 
be faithful to me, and go all over the World with 
me. 

While I was in View of the • Moor that was 
fwimming, I flood out dire&ly to Sea with the Boat, 
rather ftretching to Windward, that they might 
think me gone towards the Straits-mouth, (as indeed 
any one that had been in their Wits muft ha' been fup- 
pofed to do) for who would ha' fuppos'dwe werefaild 

on 



[26] 

on to the fouthward to the truly Barbarian Coaft, 
where whole Nations of Negroes were fure to 
furround us with their Canoes, and deftroy us ; 
where we could ne'er once go on fhoar but we 
fhould be devour'd by favage Beafts, or more mer- 
cilefs Savages of humane kind. 

But as foon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I 
chang'd my Courfe, and fteer'd direftly South and 
by Eaft, bending my Courfe a little toward the 
Eaft, that I might keep in with the Shoar ; and 
having a fair frefh Gale of Wind, and a fmooth quiet 
Sea, I made fuch Sail that I believe by the next 
Day at Three a Clock in the Afternoon, when I 
firft made the Land, I could not be lefs than 1 50 
Miles South of Sallee ; quite beyond the Em- 
peror of Morocco's Dominions, or indeed of any o- 
ther King thereabouts, for we faw no People. 

Yet fuch was the Fright I had taken at the 
Moors, and the dreadful Apprehenfions I had of 
falling into their Hands, that I would not ftop, or 
go on Shoar, or come to an Anchor ; the Wind 
continuing fair, 'till I had faiPd in that manner five 
Days : Ajid then the Wind fhifting to the fouth- 
ward, I concluded alfo that if any of ourVeffels were 
in Chafe of me, they alfo would now give over ; 
fo I ventur'd to make to the Coaft, and came to 
an Anchor in the Mouth of a little River, I knew 
not what, or where ; neither what Latitude, what 
Country, what Nations, or what River : I neither 
faw, or defir'd to fee any People, the principal thing 
I wanted was frefh Water: We came into this 
Creek in the Evening, refolving to fwim on ftioar 
as foon as it was dark, and difcover the Country ; 
but as foon as it was quite dark, we heard fuch 
dreadful Noifes of the Barking, Roaring, and 
Howling of Wild Creatures, of we knew not what 
Kinds, that the poor Boy was ready to die with 

Fear, 



[*7] 

Fear, and beg'd of me not to go on fhoar till 
Day ; well Xury faid I, then I won't, but it may 
be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as bad 
to us as thofe Lyons ; then we give tbem the fhoot Gun 
fays Xury laughing, make tbemrunwey ; fuch Englijh 
Xury {poke by converging among us Slaves, how- 
ever I was glad to fee the Boy fo cheerful, and I 
gave him a Dram (out of our Patroon's Cafe of Bot- 
tles) to chear him up : After all, Xury's Advice 
was good, and I took it, we dropt our little An- 
chor and lay ftill all Night ; I fay ftill, for we flept 
none ! for in two or three Hours we faw vaft 
great Creatures (we knew not what to call them) 
of many forts, come down to the Sea-fhoar and run 
into the Water, wallowing and wafhing themfelves 
for the Pfcafure of cooling themfelves ; and they 
made fuch hideous Howlings and Yellings, that I 
never indeed heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed io was 
I too ; but we were both more frighted when we 
heard one of thefe mighty Creatures come fwim- 
ming towards our Boat, we could not fee him, but 
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon- 
ftrous, huge and furious Beaft ; Xury faid it was 
a Lyon, and it. might be fo for ought I know; but 
poor Xury cryed to me to weigh the Anchor and 
row away ; no fays I, Xury> we can flip our Cable 
with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea, they can- 
not follow us far ; I had no fooner faid fo, but I 
perceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within 
Two Oars Length, which fomething furprized 
me; however I immediately ftept to theCabbin- 
door, and taking up my Gun fir'd at him, upon 
which he immediately turn'd about and fwam to- 
wards the Shoar again. 

But it is impoflible to defcribe the horrible Noi- 
fes, and hideous Cryes and Howlings, that were 

raifed 



[ 28 ] 

raifed as well upon the Edge of the Shoar, as high- 
er within the Country ; upon the Noife or Re- 
port of the Gun, a Thing I have fome Reafon to 
believe thofe Creatures had never heard before : 
This Convinced me that there was no going on 
Shoar for us in the Night upon that Coaft, and 
how to venture on Shoar in the Day was ano- 
ther Queftion too; for to have fallen into the 
Hands of any of the Savages, had been as bad 
as to have fallen into the Hands of Lyons and 
Tygers; at leaft we were equally apprehenfive 
of the Danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on 
Shoar fomewhere or other for Water, for we had 
not a Pint left in the Boat ; when or where to get to 
it was the Point : Xury faid, if I would let him go 
on Shoar with one of the Jarrs, he would find if there 
was any Water and bring fome to me. I ask'd 
him why he would go ? Why I (hould not go and 
he ftay in the Boat ? The Boy anfwer'd with fo 
much Afle&ion that made me love him ever 
after. Says he, If wild Mans come, they eat me, you 
go wey. Well, Xury, faid I, we will both go, and 
if the wild Man's come we will kill them, they 
fhall Eat neither of us ; fo I gave Xury a piece of 
Rusk-bread to Eat and a Dram out of our Pa- 
troons Cafe of Bottles which I mentioned before ; 
and we hal'd the Boat in as near the Shoar as we 
thought was proper, and fo waded on Shoar, car- 
rying nothing but our Arms and two Jarrs for 
Water. 

I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat, 
fearing the coming of Canoes with Savages 
down the River ; but the Boy feeing a low Place 
about a Mile up the Country rambled to it ; and 
by and by I faw him come running towards me, 
I thought he was purfued by some Savage, or 

frighted 



[ 19 ] 

frighted with fome wild Beaft, and I run forward 
towards him to help him, but when I came near- 
er to him, I faw fomething hanging over his 
Shoulders which was a Creature that he had fhot, 
like a Hare but different in Colour, and longer 
Legs, however we were very glad of it, and it 
was very good Meat ; but the great Joy that poor 
Xury came with, was to tell me he had found good 
Water and feen no wild Mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take 
fuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the 
Creek where we were, we found the Water frefh 
when the Tide was out, which flowed but a little 
way up ; fo we filled our Jarrs and feafted on the 
Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our 
Way, having feen no Foot-fteps of any humane 
Creature in that part of the Country. 

As I had been one Voyage to this Coaft before, 
I knew very well that the Iflands of the Canaries, 
and the Cape de Verd Iflands alfo, lay not far off 
from the Coaft. But as I had no Inftruments to 
take an Obfervation to know what Latitude we 
were in, and did not exadtly know, or at leaft re- 
member what Latitude they were in ; I knew not 
where to look for them, or when to ftand off to Sea 
towards them ; otherwife I might now eafily have 
found ibme of thefe Iflands. But my hope was, 
that if I flood along this Coaft till I came to that 
Part where the Englijh Traded, I ftiould find fome 
of their Veffels upon their ufual Defign of Trade, 
that would relieve and t^ke us in. 

By the beft of my Calculation, that Place were 
I now was, muft be that Country, which lying be- 
tween the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the 
Negro's, lies waft and uninhabited, except by wild 
Beafts ; the Negroes having abandon'd it and gone 
farther South for fear of the Moors ; and the Moors 

not 



[3©] 

not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reafon of its 
Barrennefs ; and indeed both forfaking it becaufe 
of the prodigious Numbers of Tygers, Lyons, 
Leopards and other furious Creatures which har- 
bour there ; fo that the Moors ufe it for their Hun- 
ting only, where they go like an Army, two or three 
thoufand Men at a time ; and indeed for near an 
hundred Miles together upon this Coaft, we faw 
nothing but a waft uninhabited Country, by Day ; 
and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of 
wild Beafts, by Night. 

Once or twice in the Day time, I thought I faw 
the Pico of Teneriffiy being the high top of the 
Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries ; and had a great 
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither ; 
but having tried twice I was forced in again by 
contrary Winds, the Sea alfo going too high for 
my little Veflel, fo I refolved to purfue my firft 
Defign and keep along the Shoar. 

Several times I was obliged to land forfrefh 
Water, after we had left this Place ; and once in 
particular, being early in the Morning, we came 
to an Anchor under a little Point of Land which 
was pretty high, and the Tide beginning to flow, 
we lay ftill to go farther in ; Xury, whofe Eyes were 
more about him than it feems mine were, calls 
foftly to me, and tells me that we had beft go 
farther off the Shoar ; for, fays he, look yonder lies 
a dreadful Monfter on the fide of that Hillock 
faft afleep : I look'd where he pointed, and faw a 
dreadful Monfter indeed, for it was a terrible great 
Lyon that lay on the Side of the Shoar, under the 
Shade of a Piece of the Hill that hung as it were 
a little over him. Xury, fays I, you fhall go on 
Shoar and kill him ; Xury look'd frighted, and faid, 
Me kill! be eat me at one Mouth ; one Mouthful he 
meant ; however, I faid no more to the Boy, but 

bad 



[3i] 

bad him lye fiill, and I took our biggeft Gun, 
which was almoft Mufquet-bore, and loaded it 
with a good Charge of Powder, and with two 
Slugs, and laid it down ; then I loaded another 
Gun with two Bullets, and the third, for we had 
three Pieces, I loaded with five fmaller Bullets. I took 
the beft aim I could with the firft Piece to have 
fhot him into the Head, but he lay fo with his Leg 
rais'd a little above his Nofe, that the Slugs hit 
his Leg about the Knee, and broke the Bone. He 
ftarted up growling at firft, but finding his Leg broke 
fell down again, and then got up upon three Legs 
and gave the moft hideous Roar that ever I heard ; 
I was a little fuppriz'd that I had not hit him on 
the Head ; however I took up the fecond Piece 
immediately, and tho' he began to move off fir'd 
again, and fhot him into the Head, and had the 
Pleafure to fee him drop, and make but little Noife, 
but lay ftruggling for Life. Then Xury took Heart, 
and would have me let him go on Shoar : Well, go 
faid I, fo the Boy jump'd into the Water, and ta- 
king a little Gun in one Hand fwam to Shoar 
with the other Hand, and coming clofe to the 
Creature, put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, 
and ihot him into the Head again which di- 
fpatch'd him quite. 

This was Game indeed to us, buc this was no 
Food, and I was very forry to lofe three Charges 
of Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was 
good for nothing to us. However Xury faid he 
would have fome of him ; fo he comes on board, 
and ask'd me to give him the Hatchet ; for what, 
Xury, faid I ? Me cut off bis Head, faid he. How- 
ever Xury could not cut off his Head, but he cut 
off a Foot and brought it with him, and it was a 
monftrous great one. . 

I be- 



[3*] 

I bethought my felf however, that perhaps the 
Skin of him might one way or other be of fome 
Value to us ; and I refolved to take off his Skin if 
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him ; 
but Xury was much the better Workman at it, for 
I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us 
up both the whole Day, but at laft we got of the 
Hide of him, and fpreading it on the top of our 
Cabbin, the Sun effe&ually dried it in two Days 
time, and it afterwards ferv'd me to lye upon. 

After this Stop we made on to the Southward 
continually for ten or twelve Days, living very 
fparing on our Provisions, which began to abate 
very much, and going no oftner into the Shoar 
than we were oblig'd to for frefh Water ; my De- 
fign in this was to make the River Gambia or Sen- 
negally that is to fay, any where about the Cape de 
Verdy where I was in hopes to meet with fome Euro- 
pean Ship, and if I did not, I knew not what Courfe 
I had to take, but to feek out for the Iflands, or pe- 
rifh there among the Negroes. I knew that all the 
Ships from Europe, which fail'd either to the Coaft 
of Guiney, or to Brafil, or to the Eaft-Indies, made 
this Cape or thofe Iflands ; and in a word, I put the 
whole of my Fortune upon this fingle Point, either 
that I muft meet with fome Ship, or muft perifh. 

When I had purfued this Refolution about ten 
Days longer, as I have faid, I began to fee that 
the Land was inhabited, and in two or three 
Places as we failed by, we faw People ftand upon 
the Shoar to look at us, we could alfo perceive 
they were quite Black and Stark-naked. I was once 
inclin'd to ha* gone on Shoar to them ; but Xury 
was my better Councellor, and faid to me, no go, 
no go ; however I haPd in nearer the Shoar that I 
might talk to them, and I found they run along 
the Shoar by me a good way ; I obferv'd they had 

no 



[33l 



no Weapons in their Hands, except one who had a 
long flender Stick, which Xury faid was a Lance, 
and that they would throw them a great way with 
good aim ; fb I kept at a diftance, but talk'd with 
them by Signs as well as I could ; and particularly 
made Signs for fome thing to Eat, they beckon'd to 
me to ftop my Boat, and that they would fetch me 
fome Meat ; upon this I lower'd the top of my 
Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the 
Country, and in lefs than half an Hour came back 
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flefli 
and fome Corn, fuch as is the Produce of their 
Country, but we neither knew what the one or the 
other was ; however we were willing to accept it, 
but how to come at it was our next Difpute, for I 
was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they 
were as much affraid of us ; but they took a fafe 
way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore and 
laid it down, and went and flood a great way off 
till we fetch'd it on Board, and then came clofe to 

us again. 

We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had 
nothing to make them amends ; but an Opportuni- 
ty offer'd that very Inftant to oblige them won- 
derfully, for while we were lying by the Shore, 
came two mighty Creatures one purfuing the other, 
(as we took it) with great Fury, from the Mountains 
towards the Sea ; whether it was the Male purfuing 
the Female, or whether they were in Sport or in Rage, 
we could not tell, any more than we could tell whe- 
ther it was ufual or ftrange, but I believe it was the 
latter; becaufe in the firft Place, thofe ravenous 
Creatures feldom appear but in the Night ; and in 
the fecond Place, we found the People terribly 
frighted, efpecially the Women. The Man that 
had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them, 
but the reft did ; however as the two Creatures 

D ran 



[34] 



ran dire&ly into the Water, they did not feem to of- 
fer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plung'd 
themfelves into the Sea and fwam about as if 
they had come for their Diver fion ; at laft one of 
them began to come nearer our Boat than at firft I 
expe&ed, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded 
my Gun with all poffible Expedition, and bad Xury 
load both the other ; as foon as he came fairly with- 
in my reach, I fir'd, and fhot him direftly into the 
Head ; immediately he funk down into the Water, 
but rofe inftantly and plung'd up and down as if 
he was ftruggling for Life ; and fo indeed he was, 
he immediately made to the Shore, but between 
the Wound which was his mortal Hurt, and the 
ftrangling of the Water, he dyed juft before he 
reach'd the Shore. 

It is impoflible to exprefs the Aftonifhment of 
thefe poor Creatures at the Noife and the Fire of 
my Gun ; fome of them were even ready to dye 
for Fear, and fell down as Dead with the very 
Terror. But when they faw the Creature dead and 
funk in the Water, and that I made Signs to them 
to come to the Shore ; they took Heart and came 
to the Shore and began to fearch for the Creature, 
I found him by his Blood ftaining the Wateri and 
by the help of a Rope which I flung round him 
and gave the Negroes to hawl, they drag'd him on 
Shore, and found that it was a moft curious Leo- 
pard, fpotted and fine to an admirable Degree, and 
the Negroes held up their Hands with Admiration 
to think what it was I had kill'd him with. 

The other Creature frighted with the flafh of 
Fire and the Noife of the Gun fwam on Shore, 
and ran up dire&ly to the Mountains from whence 
they came, nor could I at that Diftance know 
what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were 
for eating the Flefh of this Creature, fo I was wil- 
ling 



[35] 



ling to have them take it as a Favour from me, 
which when I made Signs to them that they might 
take him, they were very thankful for, immediate- 
ly they fell to work with him, and tho* they had no 
Knife,yet with a fharpen'd Piece of Wood they took 
off his Skin as readily, and much more readily than 
we cou'd have done with a Knife ; they offer'd me 
fome of the Flefli, which I declined, making as 
if I would give it them, but made Signs for the 
Skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought 
me a great deal more of their Provision, which 
tho* I did not underftand, yet I accepted ; then I 
made Signs to them for fome Water, and held out 
one of my Jarrs to them, turning it bottom up- 
ward, to fhew that it was empty, and that I wanted 
to have it filled. They call'd immediately/ to 
fome of their Friends, and there came two Wo- 
men and brought a great Veflel made of Earth, 
and burnt as I suppoie in the Sun ; this they fet 
down for me, as before, and I fent Xury on Shore 
with my Jarrs, and filled them all three : The Wo- 
men were as ftark Naked as the Men. 

I was now furniftied with Roots and Corn, fuch 
as it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Ne- 
groes, I made forward for about eleven Days more 
without offering to go near the Shoar, till I faw 
the Land run out a great Length into the Sea, at a- 
bout the Diftance of four or five Leagues before 
me, and the Sea being very calm I kept a large, 
ofiing to make this Point; at length, doubling 
the Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I 
faw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward ; 
then I concluded, as it was moft certain indeed, 
that this was the Cape de Verd, and thofe the /- 
fiandsy call'd from thence Cape de Verd Iflands. 
However they were at a great Diftance, and I 
could not well tell what I had beft to do, for if I 

D 2 fhould 



[3<5] 



fhould be taken with a Frefti of Wind I might 
neither reach one or other. 

In this Dilemna, as I was very penfive, I ftept 
into the Cabbin and fat me down, Xury having 
the Helm, when on a fuddain the Boy cry'd out, 
Ma/ier, Mafter> a Ship with a Sail y and the foolifti 
Boy wa$ frighted out of his Wits, thinking it 
muft needs be fome of his Matter's Ships fent to 
purfue us, when, I knew we were gotten far enough 
out of their reach. I jump'd out of the Cabbin, 
and immediately faw not only the Ship, but what 
flie was, (viz.) that it was a Portugue/e Ship, and 
as I thought was bound to the Coaft of Guinea for 
Negroes. But when I obferv'd the Courfe ftie 
fteer'd, I was foon convinc'd they were bound 
fome other way, and did not defign to come any 
nearer to the Shoar ; upon which I ftretch'd out to 
Sea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with 
them if poflible. 

With all the Sail I could make, I found I fhould 
not be able to come in their Way, but that they 
would be gone by, before I could make any Signal 
to them ; but after I had crowded to the utmoft, 
and began to defpair, they it feems faw me by the 
help of their Perfpedtive-Glaffes, and that it was 
fome European Boat, which as they fuppofed muft 
belong to fome Ship that was loft, fo they ftiort- 
ned Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged 
with this, and as I had my Patroon's Antient on 
Board, I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal 
of Diftrefs, and fir'd a Gun, both which they faw, 
for they told me they faw the Smoke, tho' they did 
not hear the Gun; upon thefe Signals they very 
kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in a- 
bout three Hours time I came up with them. 

They ask'd me what I was, in Portugue/e, and in 
Spanijhy and in French, but I underftood none of 

them ; 



l37l 



them ; but at laft a Scots Sailor who was on board, 
call'd to me, and I anfwer'd him, and told him I 
was an Englijhman, that I had made my efcape out 
of Slavery from the Moors at Sallee ; then they bad 
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, 
and all my Goods. 

It was an inexpreflible Joy to me, chat any one 
will believe, that I was thus deliver'd, as I e- 
fteem'd it, from fuch a miferable and almoft hope- 
lefs Condition as I was in, and I immediately of- 
fered all I had to the Captain of the Ship, as a 
Return for my Deliverance ; but he generoufly 
told me, he would take nothing from me, but that 
all I had fhould be deliver'd fafe to me when I 
came to the Brajils, for fays he, / have fav'd your 
Life on no other Terms than I would be glad to bejaved 
my /elf, and it may one time or other be my Lot to be 
taken up in the fame Condition ; befides, faid he, when 
I carry you to the Brafils, fo great away from your own 
Country, if 1 fhould take from you what you have, you 
will be ftarved there, and then I only take away that 
life I have given. No, no, Seignor Inglefe, fays he, 
Mr. Englishman, I will carry you thither in Charity, 
and thofe things will help you to buy your Subjiftance there 
and your Paffage home again. 

As he was Charitable in his Propofal, fo he was 
Juft in the Performance to a tittle, for he ordered 
the Seamen that none fhould offer to touch any 
thing I had; then he took every thing into his own 
Pofleffion, and gave me back an exadl Inventory 
of them, that I might have them, even fo much as 
my three Earthen Jarrs. 

As to my Boat it was a very good one, and 
that he faw, and told me he would buy it of me 
for the Ship's ufe, and ask'd me what I would have 
for it ? I told him he had been fo generous to me 
in every thing, that I could not offer to make a- 

D 3 ny 



[38] 



ny Price of the Boat, but left it entirely to him > 
upon which he told me he would give me a Note 
of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it 
at Brafily and when it came there, if any one 
offer'd to give more he would make it up ; he of- 
fer'd me alfo 60 Pieces of Eight more for my Boy 
Xury> which I was loath to take, not that I was not 
willing to let the Captain have him, but I was very 
loath to fell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had affi- 
fted me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How- 
ever when I let him know my Reafon. he own'd 
it to be juft, and offer'd me this Medium, that he 
would give the Boy an Obligation to fet him free 
in ten Years, if he turn'd Chriftian ; upon this, and 
Xury faying he wa§ willing to go to him, I let the 
Captain have him. 

We had a very good Voyage to the Brafils> and ar- 
riv'd in the Bayde Todos los Santos, or All-Saints Bay, 
in about Twenty-two Days after. And now I was 
once more deliver'd from the moft miferable of all 
Conditions of life, and what to do next with my 
felf I was now to confider. 

The generous Treatment the Captain gave me, I 
can never enough remember; he would take nothing 
of me for my Paflage, gave me twenty Ducats for 
the Leopard's Skin, and forty for the Lyon's Skin 
which I had in my Boat, and caufed every thing 
I had in the Ship to be punctually deliver'd me, and 
what I was willing to fell he bought, fuch as the 
Cafe of Bottles, two of my Guns, and a Piece of 
the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made Candles of 
the reft ; in a word, I made about 220 Pieces of 
Eight of all my Cargo, and with this Stock I went 
on Shoar in the Brqftlo. 

I had not been long here, but being recommen- 
ded to the Houfe of a good honeft Man like him- 
felf, who had an Ingeino as they call it ; that is, a 

Plan- 



[3S>] 



Plantation and a Sugar-Houfe. I lived with him 
fome time, and acquainted my felf by that means 
with the Manner of their planting and making of 
Sugar ; and feeing how well the Planters liv'd, and 
how they grew rich fuddenly, I refolv'd, if I could 
get Licence to fettle there, I would turn Planter 
among them, refolving in the mean time to find out 
fome Way to get my Money which I had left in 
London remitted to me. To this Purpofe getting a 
kind of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchafed as 
much Land that was Uncur'd, as my Money would 
reach,and form'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settle- 
ment, and fuch a one as might be fuitable to the Stock 
which I propofed to my felf to receive from England. 

I had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but 
born of Englijh Parents, whofe Name was Wells> 
and in much fuch Circumftances as I was. I call 
him my Neighbour, becaufe his Plantation lay next 
to mine, and we went on very fociably together. My 
Stock was but low as well as his ; and we rather 
planted for Food than any thing elfe, for about two 
Years. However, we began to increafe, and our 
Land began to come into Order ; fo that the third 
Year we planted fome Tobacco, and made each of 
us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting Canes 
in the Year to come ; but we both wanted Help, 
and now I found more than before, I had done 
wrong in parting with my Boy Xury. 

But alas ! for me to do wrong that never did 
right, was no great Wonder : I had no Remedy but 
to go on ; I was gotten into an Employment quite 
remote to my Genius, and direftly contrary to the 
Life I delighted in, and for which I forfook my Fa- 
ther's Houfe, and broke thro' all his good Advice ; 
nay, I was coming into the very Middle Station, or 
upper Degree of low Life, which my Father advi- 
fed me to before ; and which if I refolved to go on 

D 4 with, 



[40] 



with, I might as well ha' ftaid at Home, and never 
have fatigu'd my felf in the World as I had done ; 
and I ufed often to fay to my felf, I could ha' 
done this as well in England among my Friends, as 
ha* gone 5000 Miles off to do it among Strangers 
and Salvages in a Wildernefs, and at fuch a Diftance, 
as never to hear from any Part of the World that 
had the leaft Knowledge of me. 

In this nianner I ufed to look upon my Condition 
with the utmoft Regret. I had no body to con- 
verfe with but now and then this Neighbour ; no 
Work to be done, but by the Labour of my Hands ; 
and I ufed to fay, I liv'd juft like a Man caft away 
upon fome defolate Ifland, that had no body there 
but himfelf. But how juft has it been, and howfhould 
all Men refledt, that when they compare their pre- 
fent Conditions with others that are worfe, Heaven 
may oblige them to make the Exchange, and be 
convinc'd of their former Felicity by their Experi- 
ence: I fay, how juft has it been, that the truly foli- 
tary Life I reflected on in an Ifland of meer Defola- 
tion ihould be my Lot, who had fo often unjuftly 
compar'd it with the Life which I then led, in which 
had I continued, I had in all Probability been ex- 
ceeding profperous and rich, 

I was in fome Degree fettled in my Meafures for 
carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend 
the Captain of the Ship that took me up at Sea, 
went back ; for the Ship remained there in provi- 
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage, 
near three Months, when telling him what little 
Stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me 
this friendly and fincere Advice, Seignior Inglefe Jay she\ 
for fo he always called me, if you will give meL^tters, 
and a Procuration here in Form to me, with Orders 
to the Perfon who has your Money in London, to fend 
your Effefts to Lisbon, to fuch Perfons as I (hall di- 

reft, 



[41 3 



reft, and in fuch Goods as are proper for this Coun- 
try, I will bring you the Produce of them, God 
willing, at my Return ; but fince human Affairs are 
all fubjedt to Changes and Difafters, I would have 
you give Orders but for One Hundred Pounds Sterl. 
which you fay is Half your Stock, and let the Ha- 
zard be run for the firft ; fo that if it come {afe, 
you may order the reft the fame Way ; and if it 
mifcarry, you may have the other Half to have Re- 
courfe to for your Supply. 

This was fo wholefom Advice, and look'd fo 
friendly, that I could not but be convinc'd it was the 
beft Courfe I could take ; fo I accordingly prepared 
Letters to the Gentlewoman with whom I had left 
my Money, and a Procuration to the Portuguese 
Captain, as he defired. 

I wrote the Englijh Captain's Widowa full Account 
of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Efcape, and how 
I had met with the Portugal Captain at Sea, the Hu- 
manity of his Behaviour, and in what Condition I was 
now in, with all other neceffary Direftions for my 
Supply ; and when this honeft Captain came to Lisbon, 
he found means by fome of the Englijh Merchants 
there, to fend over not the Order only, but a full 
Account of my Story to a Merchant at London, 
who reprefented it effeftually to her ; whereupon, 
fhe not only delivered the Money, but out of her 
own Pocket fent the Portugal Captain a very hand- 
fom Prefent for his Humanity and Charity to me. 

The Merchant in London vefting this Hundred 
Pounds in Englijh Goods, fuch as the Captain had 
writ for, fent them dire&ly to him at Lisbon, and he 
brought them all fafe to me to the Brq/ils, among 
which, without my Direction (for I was too young 
in my Bufinefs to think of them) he had taken Care 
to have all Sorts of Tools, Iron- Work, and Uten- 

fib 



[ 4» ] 

fils neceflary for my Plantation, and which were of 
great Ufe to me. 

When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortunes 
made, for I was furprifed with the Joy of it ; and 
my good Steward the Captain had laid out the Five 
Pounds which my Friend had fent him for a Pre- 
fent for himfelf, to purchafe, and bring me over a 
Servant under Bond for fix Years Service, and would 
not accept of any Confideration, except a little To- 
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of my 
own Produce. 

Neither was this ail ; but my Goods being all 
Englijh Manufa&ures, fuch as Cloath, Stuffs, Bays, 
and things particularly valuable and defirable in the 
Country, I found means to fell them to a very great 
Advantage ; fo that I might fay, I had more than 
four times the Value of my firft Cargo, and was 
now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour, I mean 
in the Advancement of my Plantation ; for the firft 
thing I did, I bought me a Negro Slave, and an 
European Servant aJfo; I mean another befides 
that which the Captain brought me from Lisbon. 

But as abus'd Profperity is oftentimes made the 
very Means of our greateft Adverfity, fo was it with 
me. I went on the next Year with great Succefs in 
my Plantation : I raifed fifty great Rolls of Tobac- 
co on my own Ground, more than I had difpofed of 
for Neceflaries among my Neighbours ; and thefe 
fifty Rolls being each of above a ioo Wt. were 
well cur'd and laid by againft the Return of the 
Fleet from Lisbon : and now increafing in Bufinefs 
and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of Pro- 
jeds and Undertakings beyond my Reach ; fuch as 
are indeed often the Ruine of the beft Heads in 
Bufinefs. 

Had 



[43l 



Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I 
had room for all the happy things to have yet be- 
fallen me, for which my Father fo earneftly recom- 
mended a quiet retired Life, and of which 
he had fo fenfibly defcrib'd the middle Station of 
Life to be full of; but other things attended me, 
and I was ftill to be the wilful Agent of all my 
own Miferies; and particularly to encreafe my 
Fault and double the Refledions upon my felf, 
which in my future Sorrows I fliould have leifure 
to make ; all thefe Mifcarriages were procured by 
my apparent obftinate adhering to my toolifti incli- 
nation of wandring abroad and purfuing that In- 
clination, in contradiction to the cleared Views of 
doing my felf good in a fair and plain purfuit of 
thqfe Profpe&s and thofe meafures of Life, which 
Nature and Providence concurred to prefent me 
with, and to make my Duty. 

As I had once done thus in my breaking away 
from my Parents, fo I could not be content now, 
but I muft go and leave the happy View I had ofbe- 
ing a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantation, 
only to purfue a rafh and immoderate Defire of 
rifing fafter than the Nature of the Thing admit- 
ted ; and thus I caft my felf down again into the 
deepeft Gulph of human Mifery that ever Man 
fell into, or perhaps could be confiftent with Life 
and a State Health of in the World 

To come then by the juft Degrees, to the Par- 
ticulars of this Part of my Story ; you may fup- 
pofe, that having now lived almoft four Years in 
the Brafihy and beginning to thrive and profper ve- 
ry well upon my Plantation ; I had not only learnM 
the Language, but had contracted Acquaintance 
and Friendfhip among my Fellow-Planters, as well 
as among the Merchants at St. Sahadore, which 
was our Port ; and that in my Difcourfes among 

them, 



[ 44] 



them, I had frequently given them an Account of 
my two Voyages to the Coaft of Guinea, the 
manner of Trading with the Negroes there, and 
how eafy it was to purchafe upon the Coaft, for 
Trifles, fuch as Beads, Toys, Knives, Sciflars, 
Hatchets, bits of Glafs, and the like ; not only 
Gold Duft, Guinea Grains, Elephants Teeth, ©V. 
but Negroes for the Service of the Brafils, in great 
Numbers. 

They liftened always very attentively to my 
Difcourfes on thefe Heads, but efpecially to that 
Part which related to the buying Negroes, which 
was a Trade at that time not only not far entred 
into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by 
the Affiento's, or Permiflion of the Kings of Spain 
and Portugal, and engrofs'd in the Publick, fo that 
few Negroes were brought, and thofe exceflive 
dear. 

It happen'd, being in Company with fome Mer- 
chants and Planters of my Acquaintance, and 
talking of thofe things very earneftly, three of 
them came to me the next Morning, and told me 
they had been mufing very much upon what I had 
difcourfed with them of, the laft Night, and they 
came to make a fecret Propofal to me ; and after 
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had 
a mind to fit out a Ship to go to Guinea, that 
they had all Plantations as well as I, and were 
ftraiten'd for nothing fo much as Servants ; that as 
it was a Trade that could not be carried on, be- 
caufe they could not publickly fell the Negroes 
when they came home, fo they defired to 
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes on 
Shoar privately, and divide them among their 
own Plantations ; and in a Word, the Queftion 
was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the 
Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coaft 

of 



[45] 



of Guinea ? And they offer'd me that I fhould have 
my equal Share of the Negroes without providing 
any Part of the Stock. 

This was a fair Propofal it muft be confefs'd, 
had it been made to any one that had not had a 
Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after, 
which was in a fair way of coming to be very 
Considerable, and with a good Stock upon it. But 
for me that was thus entered and eftablifhed, and 
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for 
three or four Years more, and to have fent for the 
other hundred Pound from England, and who in 
that time, and with that little Addition, could' 
fcarce ha' fail'd of being worth three or four thou- 
fand Pounds Sterling, and that encreafing too ; for 
me to think of fuch a Voyage, was the moft pre- 
poftorous Thing that ever Man in fuch Circum- 
ftances could be guilty of. 

But I that was born to be my own Deftroyer, 
could no more refift the Offer than I could re- 
ftrain my firft rambling Defigns, when my Fa- 
ther's good Counfel was loft upon me. In a word, 
I told them I would go with all my Heart, if 
they would undertake to look after my Plantation 
in my Abfence, and would difpofe of it to fuch 
as I fhould dired if I mifcarry'd. This they all 
engaged to do, and entred into Writings or Cove- 
nants to do fo ; and I made a formal Will, difpo- 
fing of my Plantation and Effects, in Cafe of my 
Death, making the Captain of the Ship that had 
fav'd my Life as before, my univerfal Heir, but 
obliging him to difpofe of my Effects as I had di- 
rected in my Will, one half of the Produce being 
to himfelf, and the other to be fh ip'd to England. 

In fhort, I took all poffible Caution to preferve 
my EfFe&s, and keep up my Plantation ; had I u- 
fed half as much Prudence to have look'd into my 

own 



[46 3 



own Intreft, and have made a Judgment of what 
I ought to have done, and not to have done, I 
had certainly never gone away from fo pros- 
perous an Undertaking, leaving all the probable 
Views of a thriving Circumftance, and gone up- 
on a Voyage to Sea, attended with all its com- 
mon Hazards ; to fay nothing of the Reafons I 
had to expedfc particular Misfortunes to my felf. 

But I was hurried on, and obey'd blindly the 
Di&ates of my Fancy rather than my Reafon ; 
and accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the 
Cargo furnilhed, and all things done as by Agree- 
ment, by my Partners in the Voyage. I went on 
Board in an evil Hour, the th of , be- 

ing the fame Day eight Year that I went from 
my Father and Mother at Hull, in order to a<5l 
the Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to my 
own Intereft. 

Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried 
6 Guns, and 14 Men, befides the Matter, his Boy, 
and my felf ; we had on board no large Cargo of 
Goods, except of fuch Toys as were fit for our 
Trade with the Negroes, fuch as Beads, bits of 
Glafs, Shells, and odd Trifles, efpecially little 
Looking-Glafles, Knives, Sciflars, Hatchets, and 
the like. 

The fame Day I went on board we fet fail, 
ftanding away to the Northward upon our own 
Coaft, with Defign to ftretch over for the African 
Coaft, when they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of 
Northern Latitude, which it feems was the man- 
ner of their Courfe in thofe Days. We had very 
good Weather, only exceffive hot, all the way up- 
on our own Coaft, till we came the Height of 
Cafe St. AuguftinOy from whence keeping farther off 
at Sea we loft Sight of Land, and fteertt as if we 
was bound for the Ifle Fernand de Noronba holding 

our 



[47] 



our Courfe N.E. by N. and leaving thofe Ifles on 
the Eaft ; in this Courfe we paft the line in about 
1 2 Days time, and were by our laft Obfervation 
in 7 Degrees 22 Min. Northern Latitude, when a 
violent Tournado or Hurricane took us quite out 
of our Knowledge ; it began from the South-Eaft, 
came about to the North- Weft, and then fettled 
into the North-Eaft, from whence it blew in fuch 
a terrible manner, that for twelve Days together 
we could do nothing but drive, and fcudding away 
before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and the 
Fury of the Winds dire&ed ; and during thefe 
twelve Days, I need not fay, that I expe&ed e- 
very Day to be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any 
in die Ship exped to fave their Lives. 

In this Diftrefs, we had befides the Terror of 
the Storm, one of our Men dyed of the Calenture, 
and one Man and the Boy wafti'd over board ; a- 
bout the 1 2th Day the Weather abating a little, 
the Mafter made an Obfervation as well as he 
could, and found that he was in about 1 1 Degrees 
North Latitude, but that he was 22 Degrees of 
Longitude difference Weft from Cape St. Auguftino ; 
io that he found he was gotten upon the Coaft 
of Guinea, or the North Part of Braftl, beyond 
the River Amozones, toward that of the River O- 
ronoque> commonly calTd the Grtat River, and be- 
gan to confult with me what Courfe he fliould 
take, for the Ship was leaky and very much difa- 
bled, and he was going direftly back to the Coaft 
of Brq/il. 

I was positively againft that, and looking over 
the Charts of the Sea-Coaft of America with him, 
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for 
us to have recourfe to, till we came within the Cir- 
cle of the Carribbe-IJlandSy and therefore refolved 
to ftand away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off 

at 



[48] 



at Sea, to avoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph 
of MexicOy we might eafily perform, as we hoped, 
in about fifteen Days Sail ; whereas we could not 
poflibly make our Voyage to the Coaft of Affrica 
without fome Affiftance, both to our Ship and to 
our felves. 

With this Defign we chang'd our Courfe and 
fteer'd away N. W. by W. in order to reach 
fome of our Englijh Iflands, where I hoped for Re- 
lief ; but our Voyage was otherwife determined, 
for being in the Latitude of 1 2 Deg. 1 8 Min. a 
fecond Storm came upon us, which carry'd us a- 
way with the fame Impetuofity Weftward , and 
drove us fo out of the very Way of all humane 
Commerce, that had ail our lives been faved, as 
to the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being de- 
voured by Savages than ever returning to our own 
Country. 

In this Diftrefs, the Wind ftill blowing very 
hard, one of our Men early in the Morning, 
cry 'd out, Land ; and we had no fooner run out 
of the Cabbin to look out in hopes of feeing 
where abouts in the World we were ; but the Ship 
ftruck upon a Sand, and in a moment her Motion 
being fo ftopp'd, the Sea broke over her in fuch a 
manner, that we expedted we ihould all have pe- 
rifh'd immediately, and we were immediately dri- 
ven into our clofe Quarters to flielter us from the 
very Foam and Sprye of the Sea. 

It is not eafy for any one, who has not been 
in the like Condition, to defcribe or conceive the 
Confternation of Men in fuch Circumftances ; we 
knew nothing where we were, or upon what Land 
it was we were driven, whether an Ifland or the 
Main, whether inhabited or not inhabited; and 
as the Rage of the Wind was ftill great, tho' ra- 
ther lefs than at firft, we could not fo much as 

hope 



[49] 



hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes with- 
out breaking in Pieces, unlefs the Winds by a 
kind of Miracle fliould turn immediately about. 
In a word, we fat looking upon one another, and 
expe&ing Death every Moment, and every Man 
adting accordingly, as preparing for another 
World, for there was little or nothing more for us 
to do in this ; that which was our prefent Comfort, 
and all the Comfort we had, was, that contrary 
to our Expe&ation the Ship did not break yet. 
and that the Mafter faid the Wind began to a- 
bate. 

Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a lit- 
tle abate, yet the Ship having thus ftruck upon 
the Sand, and flicking too faft for us to expe& 
her getting off, we were in a dreadful Condition 
indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of fa- 
ving our Lives as well as we could; we had a 
Boat at our Stern juft before the Storm, but flie 
was firft ftav'd by dafhing againft the Ship's Rud- 
der, and in the next Place flie broke away, and ei- 
ther funk or was driven off to Sea, fo there was 
no hope from her ; we had another Boat on board, 
but how to get her off into the Sea, was a doubt- 
ful thing ; however th.ere was no room to debate, 
for we fancy'd the Ship would break in Pieces e- 
very Minute, and fome told us fhe was a&ually 
broken already. 

In this Diftrefs the Mate of our Veflel lays 
hold of the Boat, and with the help of the reft of 
the Men, they got her flung over the Ship's-fide, 
and getting all into her, let go, and committed our 
felves being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy, 
and the wild Sea ; for tho' the Storm was abated 
confiderably, yet the Sea went dreadful high up- 
on the Shore, and might well be call'd, Den wild 
Zee, as the Dutch call the Sea in a Storm. 

E And 



[S°] 



And now our Cafe was very difmal indeed ; for 
we all faw plainly, that the Sea went fo high, that 
the Boat could not live, and that we fhould be ine- 
vitably drowned. As to making Sail, we had none, 
nor, if we had, could we ha' done any thing with 
it: fo we work'd at the Oar towards the Land, 
tho' with heavy Hearts, like Men going to Execu- 
tion ; for we all knew, that when the Boat came 
nearer the Shore, fhe would be dafh'd in a Thou- 
fand Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However, 
we committed our Souls to God in the moft earned 
Manner, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore, 
we haften'd our Deftruftion with our own Hands, 
pulling as well as we could towards Land. 

What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand, 
whether Steep or Shoal, we knew not ; the only 
Hope that could rationally give us the leaft Shadow 
of Expeftation, was, if we might happen into fome 
Bay or Gulph, or the Mouth of fome River, where 
by great Chance we might have run our Boat in, 
or got under the Lee of the Land, and perhaps 
made fmooth Water. But there was nothing of this 
appeared ; but as we made nearer and nearer the 
Shore, the Land look'd more frightful than the Sea. 

After we had row'd, or rather driven about a 
League and a Half, as we reckon'd it, a raging 
Wave, Mountain-like, came rowling a-ftern of us, 
and plainly bad us expedt the Coup de Grace. In a 
word, it took us with fiich a Fury, that it overfet 
the Boat at once; and feparating us as well from the 
Boat, as from one another, gave us not time hardly 
to fay, O God! for we were all fwallowed up in a 
Moment. 

Nothing can defcribe the Counfufion of Thought 
which I felt when I funk into the Water ; for tho' I 
fwam very well, yet I could not deliver my felf from 
the Waves fo as to draw Breath, till that Wave 

having 



[5i] 



having driven me, or rather carried me a vaft Way 
on towards the Shore, and having fpent it felf, 
went back, and left me upon the Land almoft dry* 
but half-dead with the Water I took in. I had fo 
much Prefence of Mind as well as Breath left, that 
feeing my felf nearer the main Land than I expe&ed, 
I got upon my Feet, and endeavoured to make on 
towards the Land as faft as I could, before another 
Wave fhould return, and take me up again. But I 
foon found it was impoflible to avoid it; for I faw 
the Sea come after me as high as a great Hill, and 
as furious as an Enemy which I had no Means or 
Strength to contend with; my Bufinefs was to hold 
my Breath, and raife my felf upon the Water, if I 
could ; and fo by fwimming to preferve my Breath- 
ing, and Pilot my felf towards the Shore, if pofli- 
ble ; my greateft Concern now being, that the Sea, 
as it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore 
when it came on, might not carry me back again 
with it when it gave back towards the Sea. 

The Wave that came upon me again, buried me 
at once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own Body ; and I 
could feel my felf carried with a mighty Force and 
Swiftnefs towards the Shore a very great Way ; but 
I held my Breath, and aflifted my felf to fwim ftill 
forward with all my Might. I was ready to burft 
with holding my Breath, when, as I felt my felf 
rifing up, fo to my immediate Relief, I found my 
Head and Hands fhoot out above the Surface of the 
Water ; and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time 
that I could keep my felf fo, yet it reliev'd me 
greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage. I was 
covered again with Water a good while, but not 
fo long but I held it out; and finding the Water 
had fpe n t it felf, and began to return, I ftrook for- 
ward againft the Return of the Waves, and felt 
Ground again with my Feet. I flood ftill a few 

E 2 Mo- 



L'5*

Moments to recover Breath, and till the Water 
went from me, and then took to my Heels, and run 
with what Strength I had farther towards the Shore. 
But neither would this deliver me from the Fury of 
the Sea, which came pouring in after me again, 
and twice more I was lifted up by the Waves, and 
carried forwards as before, the Shore being very 
flat. 

The laft Time of thefe two had well near been 
fatal to me; for the Sea having hurried me along as 
before, landed me, or rather dalh'd me againft a 
Piece of a Rock, and that with fuch Force, as it 
left me fenfelefs, and indeed helplefs, as to my own 
Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and 
Breaft, beat the Breath as it were quite out of my 
Body; and had it returned again • immediately, I 
muft have been ftrangled in the Water ; but I re- 
covered a little before the return of the Waves, 
and feeing I fhould be cover'd again with the 
Water, I refolv'd to hold faft by a Piece of the 
Rock, and fo to hold my Breath, if poflible, till 
the Wave went back ; now as the Waves were not 
fo high as at firft, being nearer Land, I held my 
Hold till the Wave abated, and then fetch'd ano- 
ther Run, which brought me fo near the Shore, 
that the next Wave, tho* it went over me, yet did 
not fo fwallow me up as to carry me away, and 
the next run I took, I got to the main Land,, 
where, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the 
Clifts of the Shore, and fat me dowu upon the 
Grafs, free from Danger, and quite out of the 
Reach of the Water. 

I was now landed, and fafe on Shore, and began 
to look up and thank God that my Life was fav'd in 
a Cafe wherein there was fome Minutes before fcarce 
any room to hope. I believe it is impoffible to ex- 
press to the Life what the Extafies and Tranfports of 

the 



[S3] 



the Soul are, when it is Co fav'd, as I may fay, out 
of the very Grave ; and I do not wonder now at 
that Cuftom, viz. That when a Malefadtor who 
has the Halter about his Neck, is tyed up, and juft 
going to be turn'd off, and has a Reprieve brought 
to him : I fay, I do not wonder that they bring a 
Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Mo- 
ment they tell him of it, that the Surprife may not 
drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart, and over- 
whelm him : 

For Judden Joys> like Griefs^ confound atfirft. 

I walk'd about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands, 
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the 
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a Thou- 
(and Geftures and Motions which I cannot defcribe, 
reflecting upon all my Comerades that were drown'd, 
and that there fhould not be one Soul fav'd but my 
felf; for, as for them, I never fawthem afterwards, 
or any Sign of them, except three of their Hats, 
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows. 

I caft my Eyes to the ftranded Veffel, when the 
Breach and Froth of the Sea being fo big, I could 
hardly fee it, it lay fo far off, and confidered, Lord ! 
how was it poffible I could get on Shore? 

After I had folac'd my Mind with the comfortable 
Part of my Condition, I began to look round me to 
fee what kind of Place I was in, and what was next 
to be done, and I foon found my Comforts abate, 
and that in a word I had a dreadful Deliverance : 
For I was wet, had no Clothes to fhift me, nor any 
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, nei- 
ther did I fee any Profpeft before me, but that of 
perifhing with Hunger, or being devour'd by wild 
Beafts ; and that which was particularly afflidling 
to me, was, that I had no Weapon either to hunt 

E 3 and 



[54] 



and kill any Creature for my Suftenance, or to de- 
fend my felf againft any other Creature that might 
defire to kill me for theirs : In a Word, I had no- 
thing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-pipe, and 
a little Tobacco in a Box, this was all my Provi- 
sion, and this threw me into terrible Agonies of 
Mind, that for a while I run about like a Mad-man ; 
Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy 
Heart to confider what would be my Lot if there 
were any ravenous Beafts in that Country, feeing 
at Night they always come abroad for their Prey. 

All the Remedy that offer'd to my Thoughts at 
that Time, was, to get up into a thick bufliy Tree 
like a Firr, but thorny, which grew near me, and 
where I refolv'd to fet all Night, and confider the 
next Day what Dearh I fhould dye, for as yet I 
faw no Profpedt of Life ; I walk'd about a Furlong 
from the Shore, to fee if I could find any frefh Wa- 
ter to drink, which I did, to my great Joy ; and 
having drank and put a little Tobacco in my 
Mouth to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, 
and getting up into it, endeavour'd to place my 
felf fo, as that if I fhould fleep I might not fall; 
and having cut me a fhort Stick, like a Truncheon, 
for my Defence, I took up my Lodging, and ha- 
ving been exceffively fatigu'd, I fell faft afleep, 
and flept as comfortably as, I believe, few could 
have done in my Condition, and found my felf 
the moft refrelh'd with it, that I think I ever was 
on fuch an Occafion. 

When I wak'd it was broad Day, the Weather 
clear, and the Storm abated, fo that the Sea did 
not rage and f well as before : But that which fur- 
pris'd me moft, was, that the Ship was lifted off 
in the Night from the Sand where fhe lay, by 
the Swelling of the Tyde, and was driven up al- 
moft as far as the Rock which I firft mention , d > 

where 



[55] 



where I had been fo bruis'd by the daftring me 
againft it; this being within about a Mile 
from the Shore where I was, and the Ship Teem- 
ing to ftand upright ftill, I wifh'd my felf on 
board, that, at leaft, I might fave fome neceflary 
things for my ufe. 

When I came down from my Appartment in the 
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the firft thing 
I found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind 
and the Sea had tofs'd her up upon the Land, a- 
bout two Miles on my right Hand, I walk'd as 
far as I could upon the Shore to have got to her, 
but found a Neck or Inlet of Water between me 
and the Boat, which was about half a Mile broad, 
to I came back for the prefent, being more intent 
upon getting at the Ship, where I hop'd to find 
fbmething for my prefent Subfiftence. 

A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm, 
and the Tyde ebb'd fo far out, that I could come 
within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship ; and here 
I found a frefh renewing of my Grief, for I faw 
evidently, <hat if we had kept on board, we had 
been all fafe, that is to fay, we had all got fafe 
on Shore, and I had not been fo miferable as to 
be left entirely deftitute of all Comfort and Com- 
pany, as I now was; this forc'd Tears from my 
Eyes again, but as there was little Relief in that, 
I refolv'd, if poflible, to get to the Ship, fo I 
pull'd off my Clothes, for the Weather was hot to 
Extremity, and took the Water, but when I came 
to the Ship, my Difficulty was ftill greater to 
know how to get on board, for as fhe lay a ground, 
and high out of the Water, there was nothing 
within my Reach to lay hold of, I fwam round 
her twice, and the fecond Time I fpy'd a fmall 
Piece of a Rope, which I wonder'd I did not fee 
at firft, hang down by the Fore-Chains fo low, 

E 4 as 



[56] 



as that with great Difficulty I got hold of it, and 
by the help of that Rope, got up into the Fore- 
caftle of the Ship, here I found that the Ship was 
bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold, 
but that (he lay fo on the Side of a Bank of hard 
Sand, or rather Earth, that her Stern lay lifted up 
upon the Bank, and her Head low almoft to 
the Water; by this Means all her Quarter was 
free, and all that was in that Part was dry; 
for you may be fure my firft Work was to fearch 
and to fee what was fpoil'd and what was 
free; and firft I found that all the Ship's Pro- 
vifions were dry and untouch'd by the Water, 
and being very well difpos'd to eat, I went to 
the Bread-room and filTd my Pockets with Bif- 
ket, and eat it as I went about other things, 
for I had no time to lofe ; I alfo found fome Rum 
in the great Cabbin, of which I took a large 
Dram, and which I had indeed need enough of 
to fpirit me for what was before me: Now I 
wanted nothing but a Boat to furnifh my felf with 
many things which I forefaw would be very ne- 
ceflary to me. 

It was in vain to fit ftill and wifh for what was 
not to be had, and this Extremity rouz'd my 
Application; we had feveral fpare Yards, and 
two or three large fparrs of Wood, and a fpare 
Top-maft or two in the Ship ; I refolv'd to fall to 
work with thefe, and I flung as many of them 
over board as I could manage for their Weight, 
tying every one with a Rope that they might 
not drive away ; when this was done I went down 
the Ship's Side, and pulling them to me, I ty'd 
four of them faft together at both Ends as well 
as I could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying 
two or three fhort Pieces of Plank upon them 
crofs-ways, I found I could walk upon it very 

well, 



[57] 



well, but that it was not able to bear any great 
Weight, the Pieces being too light ; fo I went to 
work, and with the Carpenters Saw I cut a fpare 
Top-maft into three Lengths, and added them to 
my Raft, with a great deal of Labour and Pains, 
but hope of furnifhing my felf with Neceflaries, 
encourag'd me to go beyond what I ihould have 
been able to have done upon another Occafion. 

My Raft was now ftrong enough to bear any 
reafonable Weight; my next Care was what to 
load it with, and how to preferve what I laid upon 
it from the Surf of the Sea; But I was not long confi- 
dering this, I firft laid all the Plank or Boards upon it 
that I could get, and having confider'd well what 
I moft wanted, I firft got three of the Seamens 
Chefts, which I had broken open and empty'd, 
and lower'd tfrem down upon my Raft ; the firft 
of thefe I fiird with Provifion, viz. Bread, Rice, 
three Dutch Cheefes, five Pieces of dry'd Goat's 
Flefh, which we liv'd much upon, and a little Re- 
mainder of European Corn which had been laid by 
for fome Fowls which we brought to Sea with us, 
but the Fowls were kill'd, there had been fome 
Barly and Wheat together, but, to my great Dis- 
appointment, I found afterwards that the Rats had 
eaten or fpoil'd it all ; as for Liquors, I found fe- 
veral Cafes of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, in 
which were fome Cordial Waters, and in all about 
five or fix Gallons of Rack, thefe I ftow'd by 
themfelves, there being no need to put them into 
the Cheft, nor no room for them. While I was 
doing this, I found the Tyde began to flow, tho' 
very calm, and I had the Mortification to fee my 
Coat, Shirt, and Waft-coat which I had left on 
Shore upon the Sand, fwim away; as for my 
Breeches which were only Linnen and open knee'd, 
I fwam on board in them and my Stockings : How- 
ever 



CS8] 



ever this put me upon rummaging for Clothes, of 
which I found enough, but took no more than I 
wanted for prefent ufe, for I had other things 
which my Eye was more upon, as firft Tools to 
work with on Shore, and it was after long fearch- 
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Cheft, which 
was indeed a very ufeful Prize to me, and much 
more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would 
have been at that time ; I got it down to my Raft, 
even whole as it was, without lofing time to look 
into it, for I knew in general what it contain'd 

My next Care was for fome Ammunition and 
Arms ; there were two very good Fowling-pieces 
in the great Cabbin, and two Piftols, thefe I fe- 
cur'd firft, with fome Powder-horns, and a fmall 
Bag of Shot, and two old rufty Swords; I knew 
there were three Barrels of Powdec in the Ship, 
but knew not where our Gunner had ftow'd them, 
but with much feareh I found them, two of them 
dry and good, the third had taken Water, thofe 
two I got to my Raft, with the Arms, and now 
I thought my felf pretty well freighted, and be- 
gan to think how I fhould get to Shore with them, 
having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and the leaft 
Cap full of Wind would have overfet all my Na- 
vigation, 

I had three Encouragements, i. A fmooth 
calm Sea, 2. The Tide rifing and fetting in to 
the Shore, 3. What little Wind there was blew 
me towards the Land; and thus, having found two 
or three broken Oars belong to the Boat, and be- 
fides the Tools which were in the Cheft I found 
two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this 
Cargo I put to Sea: For a Mile, or thereabouts, my 
Raft went very well, only that I found it drive a 
little diftant from the Place where I had landed be- 
fore, by which I perceiv'd that there was fome In- 
draft 



[59] 



draft of the Water, and confequently I hop'd to 
find fome Creek or River there, which I might 
make ufe of as a Port to get to Land with my 
Cargo. 

As I imagin'd, fo it was, there appear'd before 
me a little opening of the Land, and I found a 
ftrong Current of the Tide fet into it, fo I gui- 
ded my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Mid- 
dle of the Stream : But here I had like to have 
fuffer'd a fecond Shipwreck, which, if I had, I 
think verily would have broke my Heart, for know- 
ing nothing of the Coaft, my Raft run a-ground 
at one End of it upon a Shoal, and not being a- 
ground at the other End, it wanted but a little 
that all my Cargo had flip'd off towards that End 
that was a-float, and fo fall'n into the Water: I 
did my utmoft by fetting my Back againft the 
Chefts, to keep them in their Places, but could 
not thruft off the Raft with all my Strength, nei- 
ther durft I ftir from the Pofture I was in, but 
holding up the Chefts with all my Might, ftood in 
that Manner near half an Hour, in which time 
the rifing of the Water brought me a little more 
upon a Level, and a little after, the Water ftill 
rifing, my Raft floated again, and I thruft her off 
with the Oar I had, into the Channel, and then 
driving up higher, I at length found my felf in 
the Mouth of a little River, with Land on both 
Sides, and a ftrong Current or Tide running up, 
I look'd on both Sides for a proper Place to get to 
Shore, for I was not willing to be driven too high 
up the River, hoping in time to fee fome Ship 
at Sea, and therefore refolv'd to place my felf as 
near the Coaft as I could. 

At length I fpy'd a little Cove on the right 
Shore of the Creek, to which with great Pain and 
Difficulty I guided my Raft, aud at laft got fo near, 

as 



[6o] 



as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could 
thruft her dire&ly in, but here I had like to have 
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again ; for that Shore 
lying pretty fteep, that is to fay doping, there 
was no Place to land, but where one End of my 
Float, if it run on Shore, would lie fo high, and 
the other fink lower as before, that it would en- 
danger my Cargo again : All that I could do, was 
to wait 'till the Tide was at higheft, keeping the 
Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side 
of it faft to the Shore, near a flat Piece of 
Ground, which I expe&ed the Water would flow 
over ; and fo it did : As foon as I found Water 
enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot Water, I 
thruft her on upon that flat Piece of Ground, and 
there fafien'd or mor'd her by flicking my two 
broken Oars into the Ground; one on one Side 
near one End, and one on the other Side near the 
other End ; and thus I lay 'till the Water ebb'd 
away, and left my Raft and all my Cargoe fafe on 
Shore. 

My next Work was to view the Country, and 
feek a proper Place for my Habitation, and where 
to ftow my Goods to fecure them from whatever 
might happen ; where I was I yet knew not, whe- 
ther on the Continent or on an Ifland, whether in- 
habited or not inhabited, whether in Danger of 
wild Beafts or not: There was a Hill not above 
a Mile from me, which rofe up very fteep and high, 
and which feem'd to over-top fome other Hills, 
which lay as in a Ridge from it northward; I took 
out one of the fowling Pieces, and one of the Pi- 
ftols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I 
travelTd for Difcovery up to the Top of that Hill, 
where after I had with great Labour and Difficul- 
ty got to the Top, I faw my Fate to my great 
Afflidlion, (viz.) that I was in an Ifland environ 'd 

every 



[6i] 



every Way with the Sea, no Land to be feen, ex- 
cept fome Rocks which lay a great Way off, and 
two fmall Iflands lefs than this, which lay about 
three Leagues to the Weft. 

I found alfo that the Ifland I was in was bar- 
ren, and, as I faw good Reafon to belieye, un-in- 
habited, except by wild Beafts, of whom however 
I faw none, yet I faw Abundance of Fowls, but 
knew not their Kinds, neither when I kill'd them 
could I tell what was fit for Food, and what not ; 
at my coming back, I fhot at a great Bird which 
I faw fitting upon a Tree on the Side of a great 
Wood, I believe it was the firft Gun that had been 
fir'd there fince the Creation of the World ; I 
had no fooner fir'd, but from all the Parts of the 
Wood there arofe an innumerable Number of Fowls 
of many Sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and 
crying every one according to his ufual Note ; but 
not one of them of any Kind that I knew : As for 
the Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a Kind of a 
Hawk, its Colour and Beak refembling it, but had 
no Talons or Claws more than common, its Flefh 
was Carrion, and fit for nothing. 

Contented with this Difcovery, I came back to 
my Raft, and fell to Work to bring my Cargoe on 
Shore, which took me up the reft of that Day, and 
what to do with my felf at Night I knew not, nor 
indeed where to reft ; for I was afraid to lie down 
on the Ground, not knowing but fome wild Beaft 
might devour me, tho' as I afterwards found, there 
was really no Need for thofe Fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricado'd my 
felf round with the Chefts and Boards that I had 
brought on Shore, and made a Kind of a Hut for that 
Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet faw not 
which Way to fupply my felf, except that I had 

feen 



[62] 



feen two or three Creatures like Hares run out of 
the Wood where I ftiot the Fowl. 

I now began to confider, that I might yet get 
a great many Things out of the Ship, which would 
be ufeful to me, and particularly fome of the Rig- 
ging, and Sails, and-fuch other Things as might 
come to Land, and I refolved to make another 
Voyage on Board the Veflel, if poflible; and as I 
knew that the firft Storm that blew muft neceffarily 
break her all in Pieces, I refolv'd to fet all other 
Things apart, 'till I got every Thing out of the 
Ship that I could get; then I call'd a Council, that 
is to fay, in my Thoughts, whether I fhould take 
back the Raft, but this appear'd impra&icable ; 
fo I refolv'd to go as before, when the Tide was 
down, and I did fo, only that I ftripp'd before I 
went from my Hut, having nothing on but a Che- 
quer'd Shirt, and a Pair of Linnen Drawers, and a 
Pair of Pumps on my Feet. 

I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepard 
a fecond Raft, and having had Experience of the 
firft, I neither made this fo unweildy, nor loaded 
it fo hard, but yet I brought away feveral Things 
very ufeful to me; as firft, in the Carpenter's Stores 
I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spikes, 
a great Skrew- Jack, a Dozen or two of Hatchets, 
and above all, that moft ufeful Thrng calPd a 
Grindftone; all thefe I fecur'd together, with fe- 
veral Things belonging to the Gunner, particular- 
ly two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of 
Mufquet Bullets, feven Mufquets, and another 
fowling Piece, with fome final 1 Quantity of Pow- 
der more ; a large Bag full of fmall Shot, and a 
great Roll of Sheet Lead : But this laft was fo hea- 
vy, I could not hoife it up to get it over the Ship's 
Side. 

Befides thefe Things, I took all the Mens Cloths 
that I could find, and a fpare Fore-top-fail, a Ham- 
mock, 



[6 3 ] 



mock, and fome Bedding; and with this I loaded 
my fecond Raft, and brought them all fafe on Shore 
to my very great Comfort. 

I was under fome Apprehenfions during my Ab- 
fence from the Land, that at leaft my Provifions 
might be devourd on Shore; but when I came 
back, I found no Sign of any Vifitor, only there 
fat a Creature like a wild Cat upon one of the Chefts, 
which when I came towards it, ran away a little 
Diftance, and then flood ftill; fhe fat very com- 
pos'd, and unconcern'd, and look'd full in my Face, 
as if fhe had a Mind to be acquainted with me, 
I prefented my Gun at her, but as fhe did not un- 
derftand it, fhe was perfe&ly unconcern'd at it, nor 
did fhe offer to ftir away; upon which I tofs'd 
her a Bit of Bisket, tho' by the Way I was not 
very free of it, for my Store was not great: How- 
ever, I fpar'd her a Bit, I fay, and fhe went to it, 
fmeird of it, and ate it, and look'd (as pleas'd) 
for more, but I thank'd her, and could fpare no 
more; fb fhe march'd off. 

Having got my fecond Cargoe on Shore, tho' I 
Avas fain to open the Barrels of Powder, and bring 
them by Parcels, for they were too heavy, being 
large Casks, I went to work to make me a little 
Tent with the Sail and fome Poles which I cut for 
that Purpofe, and into this Tent I brought every 
Thing that I knew would fpoil, either with Rain 
or Sun, and I piled all the empty Chefts and Casks 
up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from 
any fudden Attempt, either from Man or Beaft. 

When I had done this I block'd up the Door of 
the Tent with fome Boards within, and an em- 
pty Cheft fet up an End without, and fpreading 
one of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two 
Piftols juft at my Head, and my Gun at Length 
by me, I went to Bed for the firft T*me, and flept 

very 



[64] 



very quietly all Night, for I was very weary and 
heavy, for the Night before I had flept little, 
and had labour'd very hard all Day, as well to 
fetch all thofe Things from the Ship, as to get 
them on Shore. 

I had the biggeft Maggazin of all Kinds now 
that ever were laid up, I believe, for one Man, 
but I was not fatisfy'd ftill ; for while the Ship 
fat upright in that Pofture, I thought I ought to 
get every Thing out of her that I could ; fo every 
Day at low Water I went on Board, and brought 
away fome Thing or other : But particularly the 
third Time I went, I brought away as much of 
the Rigging as I could, as alfo all the fmall Ropes 
and Rope-twine I could get, with a Piece of fpare 
Canvafs, which was to mend the Sails upon Occa- 
fion, the Barrel of wet Gun-powder: In a Word, 
I brought away all the Sails firft and laft, only that 
I was fain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as much 
at a Time as I could ; for they were no more ufe- 
ful to be Sails, but as meei? Canvafs only. 

But that which comforted me more ftill was, 
that at laft of all, after I had made five or fix fuch 
Voyages as thefe, and thought I had nothing more 
to exped from the Ship that was worth my med- 
ling with, I fay, after all this, I found a great Hogf- 
head of Bread and three large Runlets of Rum or 
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine 
Flower ; this was furprizing to me, becaufe I had 
given over expeding any more Provifions, except 
what was fpoiPd by the Water : I foon empty'd the 
Hogfhead of that Bread, and wrapt it up Parcel 
by Parcel in Pieces of the Sails, which I cut out ; 
and in a Word, I got all this fafe on Shore al- 
fo. 

The next Day I made another Voyage; and 
now having plunder'd the Ship of what was porta- 
ble 



[6 5 ] 



ble and fit to hand out, I began with the Cables ; 
and cutting the great Cable into Pieces, fuch as 
I could move, I got two Cables and a Hawfer on 
Shore, with all the Iron Work I could get ; and 
having cut down the Spritfail-yard, and the Miflen- 
yard, and every Thing I could to make a large 
Raft, I loaded it with all thofe heavy Goods, and 
came away: But my good Luck began now to 
leave me ; for this Raft was fo unweildy, and fo 
overloaden, that after I was enter 'd the little Cove, 
where I had landed the reft of my Goods, not be- 
ing able to guide it fo handily as I did the other, 
it overfet, and threw me and all my Cargoe into 
the Water; as for my felf it was no great Harm, 
for I was near the Shore; but as to my Cargoe, it 
was great Part of it loft, efpecially the Iron, 
which I expe&ed would have been of great Ufe 
to me : However, when the Tide was out, I got 
moft of the Pieces of Cable afhore, and fome of the 
Iron, tho* with infinite Labour ; for I was fain to 
dip for it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd 
me very much : After this I went every Day on 
Board, and brought away what I could get. 

I had been now thirteen Days on Shore, and had 
been eleven Times on Board the Ship; in which Time 
I had brought away all that one Pair of Hands 
could well be fuppos'd capable to bring, tho' I be- 
lieve verily, had the calm Weather held, I fhould 
have brought away the whole Ship Piece by Piece: 
But preparing the 1.2th Time to go on Board, I 
found the Wind begin to rife; however at low Wa- 
ter I went on Board, and tho' I thought I had ru- 
mag'd the Cabbin fo effectually, as that nothing 
more could be found, yet I difcover'd a Locker 
with Drawers in it, in one of which I found two 
or three Razors, and one Pair of large Sizzers, 
with fome ten or a Dozen of good Knives and 

F Forks; 



[66] 



Forks, in another I found about Thirty fix Pounds 
value in Money, fome European Coin, fome Brafil y 
fome Pieces of Eight, fome Gold, fome Silver. 
I fmil'd to my felf at the Sight of this Money, 

Drug! Said I aloud, what art thou good for, 
Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off 
of the Ground, one of thofe Knives is worth all 
this Heap, I have no Manner of ufe for thee, e'en 
remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as 
a Creature whofe Life is not worth faving. How- 
ever, upon Second Thoughts, I took it away, and 
wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, I began 
to think of making another Raft, but while I was 
preparing this, I found the Sky over-caft, and the 
Wind began to rife, and in a Quarter of an Hour 
it blew a frefli Gale from the Shore; it prefently 
occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to 
make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that 
it was my Bufinefs to be gone before the Tide of 
Flood began, otherwife I might not be able to 
reach the Shore at all : Accordingly I let my felf 
down into the Water, and fwam crofs the Channel, 
which lay between the Ship and the Sands, and 
even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the 
Weight of the Things I had about me, and partly 
the Roughnefs of the Water, for the Wind rofe 
very haftily, and before it was quite high Water, 
it blew a Storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where 

1 lay with all my Wealth about me very fecure. It 
blew very hard all that Night, and in the Morning 
when I look'd out, behold no more Ship was to be 
feen; I was a little furpriz'd, but recover'd my 
felf with this fatisfa&ory Refle&ion, viz. That I 
had loft no time, nor abated no Dilligence tp get 
every thing out of her that could be ufeful to me, 
and that indeed there was little left in her that I 

was 



[6 7 ] 



was able to bring away* if I had had more 
time. 

I now gave over any more Thoughts of the Ship, 
or of any thing out of her, except what might drive 
on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed divers Pieces 
of her afterwards did ; but. thofe things were of 
fmall ufe to me. 

My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about 
fecuring my felf againft either Savages, if any fhould 
appear, or wild Beafts, if any were in the Ifland ; 
and I had many Thoughts of the Method how to 
do this, and what kind of Dwelling to make, whe- 
ther I fhould make me a Cave in the Earth, or a 
Tent upon the Earth: And, in fhort, Irefolv'd up- 
on both, the Manner and Difcription of which, it 
may not be improper to give an Account of. 

I fooon found the Place I was in was not for my 
Settlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low 
moorifh Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd would 
not be wholfome, and more particularly becaufe 
there was no frefh Water near it, fo I refolv'd to 
find a more healthy and more convenient Spot of 
Ground. 

I confulted feveral Things in my Situation which 
I found would be proper for me, ift. Health, and 
frefh Water I juft now mentioned, 2dly. Shelter 
from the Heat of the Sun, 3dly. Security from ra- 
venous Creatures, whether Men or Beafts, 4thly. 
a View to the Sea, that if God fent any 5hip in 
Sight, I might not lofe any Advantage for my De- 
liverance, of which I was not willing to banifh all 
my Expe&ation yet. 

In fearch of a Place proper for this, I found a 
little Plain on. the Side of a riling Hill, whofe 
Front towards this little Plain, was fteep as 
a Houfe-fide, fo that nothing could come down 
upon me from the Top; on the Side of this Rock 

F 2 there 



[68] 



there was a hollow Place worn a little way in like 
the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was not 
really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all. 

On the Flat of the Green, juft before this hollow 
Place, I refolv'd to pitch my Tent : This Plain was 
not above an Hundred Yards broad, and about 
twice as long, and lay like a Green before my 
Door, and at the End of it defcended irregularly 
every Way down into the Low-grounds by the Sea- 
fide/ It was on the N. N. W. Side of the Hill, fo 
that I was fhelter'd from the Heat every Day, till 
it came to a W. and by S. Sun, or thereabouts, 
which in thofe Countries is near the Setting. 

Before I fet up my Tent, I drew a half Circle 
before the hollow Place, which took in about Ten 
Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock, and 
Twenty Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning 
and Ending. 

In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of ftrong 
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they flood 
very firm like Piles, the biggeft End being out of the 
Ground about Five Foot and a Half, and fharpen'd 
on the Top: The two Rows did not ftand above 
Six Inches from one another. 

Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut 
in the Ship, and I laid them in Rows one upon 
another, within the Circle, between thefe two 
Rows of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other 
Stakes in the In-fide, leaning againft them, about 
two Foot and a half high, like a Spurr to a Poft, 
and this Fence was fo ftrong, that neither Man or 
Beaft could get into it or over it : This coft me a 
great deal of Time and Labour, efpecially to cut 
the Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place, 
and drive them into the Eaith. 

The Entrance into this Place I made to be not 
by a Door, but by a (hort Ladder to go over 

the 



the Top, which Ladder, when I was in, I lifted 
over after me, and fo I was compleatly fenc'd in, 
and fortify'd, as I thought, from all the World, and 
confequently flept fecure in the Night, which other- 
wife I could not have done, tho', as it appear'd af- 
terward, there was no need of all this Caution from 
the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from. 

Into this Fence or Fortrefs, with infinite La- 
bour, I carry 'd all my Riches, all my Provifions, 
Ammunition and Stores, of which you have the 
Account above, and I made me a large Tent, which, 
to preferve me from the Rains that in one Part of 
the Year are very violent there, I made double, 
viz. One fmaller Tent within, and one larger 
Tent above it, and cover 'd the uppermoft with a 
large Tarpaulin which I had fav'd among the Sails. 

And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed 
which I had brought on Shore, but in a Ham- 
mock, which was indeed a very good one, and 
belong'd to the Mate of the Ship. 

Into this Tent I brought all my Provifions, and 
every thing that would lpoil by the Wet, and ha- 
ving thus enclosed . all my Goods, I made up the 
Entrance, which till now I had left open, and fo 
pafs'd and re-pafe'd, as I faid, by a fhort Ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my 
Way into the Rock, and bringing all the Earth and 
Stones that I dug down out thro' my Tent, I 
laid 'em up within my Fence in the Nature of a Ter- 
ras, that fo it rais'd the Ground within about a 
Foot and a Half; and thus I made me a Cave juft 
behind my Tent, which ferv'd me like a Cellar to 
my Houfe. 

It coft me much Labour, and many Days, be- 
fore all thefe Things were brought to Perfection, and 
therefore I muft go back to fome other Things which 
tookupfome of my Thoughts. At the fame time it 

happen'd 

F3 



[7°] 



happen'd after I had laid my Scheme for the fet- 
ting up my Tent and making the Cave, that a 
Storm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud, a 
fudden Flafh of Lightning happen'd, and after that 
a great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Effeft 
orit; I was not fo much furpris'd with the Light- 
ning as I was with a Thought which darted into 
my Mind as fwift as the Lightning it felf: O my 
Powder ! My very Heart funk within me, when I 
thought, that at one Blaft all my Powder might be 
deftroy'd, on which, not my Defence only, but the 
providing me Food, as I thought, entirely depen- 
ded ; I was nothing near fo anxious about my own 
Danger, tho* had the Powder took fire, I had ne- 
ver known who had hurt me. 

Such Impreflion did this make upon me, that 
after the Storm was over, I laid afide all my 
Works, my Building, and Fortifying, and apply'd 
my felf to make Bags and Boxes to feparate 
the Powder, and keep it a little and a little in a 
Parcel, in hope, that whatever might come, it might 
not all take Fire at once, and to keep it fo apart 
that it fhould not be poffible to make one part fire 
another: I finifh'd this Work in about a Fort night, 
and I think my Powder, which in all was about 
240 1. weight was divided in not lefs than a Hun- 
dred Parcels; as to the Barrel that had been wet> 
I did not apprehend any Danger from that, fo I 
plac'd it in my new Cave, which in my Fancy I 
call'd my Kitchin, and the reft I hid up and down 
in Holes among the Rocks, fo that no wet might 
come to it, marking very carefully where I laid 
it. 

In the Interval of time while this was doing I 
went out once at leaft every Day with my Gun 
as well to divert my felf, as to fee if I could kill any 
thing fit for Food, and as near as I could to ac- 
quaint 



[7i] 



quaint my felf with what the Ifland produced. The 
firft time I went out I prefently difcover'd that 
there were Goats in the Ifland, which was a great 
Satisfa&ion to me; but then it was attended with 
this Misfortune to me, viz. That they were fo 
fhy, fb fubtile, and fo fwift of Foot, that it was 
the difficulteft thing in the World to come at them: 
But I was not difcourag'd at this, not doubting 
but I might now and then fhoot one, as it foon hap- 
pen'd, for after I had found their Haunts a little, 
I laid wait in this Manner for them : I obferv'd if 
they faw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon 
the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible 
Fright ; but if they were feeding in the Valleys, 
and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice 
of me, from whence I concluded, that by the 
Poiition of their Opticks, their Sight was 
fo directed downward, that they did not rea- 
dily fee Objefts that were above them; fo 
afterward I took this Method, I always 
clim'd the Rocks firft to get above them, 
and then had frequently a fair Mark. The firft 
/hot I made among thefe Creatures, I kill'd a She- 
Goat which had a little Kid by her which fhe gave 
Suck to, which griev'd me heartily ; but when the 
Old one fell, the Kid ftood ftock (till by her till I 
came and took her up, and not only fo, but when I 
carry 'd the Old one with me upon my Shoulders, 
the Kid follow'd me quite to my Enclofure, upon 
which I laid down the Dam, and took the Kid in 
my Arms, and carry 'd it over my Pale, in hopes 
to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat, 
fo I was forc'd to kill it and eat it my felf; thefe 
two fupply'd me with Flefli a great while, for I 
eat fparingly ; and fav'd my Provifions (my Bread 
efpecially) as much as poflibly I could 

F 4 Having 



[71] 



Having now fix'd my Habitation, I found it ab- 
solutely neceflary to provide a Place to make a 
Fire in, and Fewel to burn ; and what I did for 
that, as alfo how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what 
Conveniencies I made, I fhall give a full Account 
of in its Place : But I muft firft give fome litde 
Account of my felf, and of my Thoughts about 
Living, which it may well be fuppos'd were not 
a few. 

I had a difmal Profped of my Condition, for as 
I was not caft away upon that Iftand without be- 
ing driven, as is faid, by a violent Storm quite out 
of the Courfe of our intended Voyage, and a great 
Way, viz. fome Hundreds of Leagues out of the 
ordinary Courfe of the Trade of Mankind, I had 

freat Reafon to confider it as a Determination of 
leaven, that in this defolate Place, and in this 
defolate Manner I fhould end my Life ; the Tears 
would run plentifully down my Face when I made 
thefe Reflections, and fometimes I would expoftu- 
late with my felf, Why Providence fhould thus 
compleatly ruine its Creatures, and render them 
fo abfolutely miferable, fo without Help abandon'd, 
fo entirely deprefs'd, that it could hardly be ra- 
tional to be thankful for fuch a Life. 

But fomething always return'd fwift upon me to 
check thefe Thoughts, and to reprove me; and 
particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my 
Hand by the Sea-fide, I was very penfive upon the 
Subjeft of my prefent Condition, when Reafon as 
it were expoftulated with me t'other Way, thus : 
Well, you are in a defolate Condition 'tis true, but 
pray remember, Where are the reft of you ? Did 
not you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where 
are the Ten? Why were not they fav'd and you 
loft ? Why were you fingled out? Is it better to be 
here or there, and then I pointed to the Sea ? All 

Evils 



[73] 



Evills are to be confider'd with the Good that is 
in them, and with what worfe attends them. 

Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was 
furnifh'd for my Subfiftence, and what would have 
been my Cafe if it had not happen'd, Which was 
an Hundred Thou/and to one, that the Ship floated 
from the Place where fhe firft ftruck and was dri- 
ven fo near to the Shore that I had time to get 
all thefe Things out of her: What would have 
been my Cafe, if I had been to have liv'd in the 
Condition in which I at firft came on Shore, with- 
out Neceflaries of Life, or Neceflaries to fupply 
and procure them ? Particularly faid I aloud, (tho* 
to my felf) what fhould I ha' done without 
a Gun, without Ammunition, without any 
Tools to make any thing, or to work with, 
without Clothes, Bedding, a Tent, or any man- 
ner of Covering, and that now I had all thefe to 
a Sufficient Quantity, and was in a fair way to 
provide my felf in fuch a manner, as to live with- 
out my Gun when my Ammunition was fpent ; fo 
that I had a tollerable View of fubfifting without 
any Want as long as I liv'd ; for I confider'd from 
the beginning how I would provide for the Ac- 
cidents that might happen, and for the time that 
was to come, even not only after my Ammunition 
fhould be fpent, but even after my Health or Strength 
fhould decay. 

I confefs I had not entertain'd any Notion of my 
Ammunition being deftroy'd at one Blaft, I mean 
my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this 
made the Thoughts of it fo furprifing to me when 
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I obferv'd juft now. 

And now being to enter into a melancholy Re- 
lation of a Scene of filent Life, fuch perhaps as 
was never heard of in the World before, I fhall 
take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its 

Order. 



[74] 



Order. It was, by my Account, the 30th. of Sept. 
when, in the Manner as above faid, I firft fet Foot 
upon this horrid Ifland, when the Sun being, to 
us, in its Autumnal Equinox, was almoft juft over 
my Head, for I reckon'd my felf, by Observation, 
to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees 22 Minutes 
North of the Line. 

After I had been there about Ten or Twelve 
Days, it came into my Thoughts that I ftiould 
lofe my Reckoning of Time for want of Books 
and Pen and Ink, and fhould even forget the Sab- 
bath Days from the working Days ; but to prevent 
this I cut it with my Knife upon a large Poft, ih 
Captital Letters, and making it into a great Crofs I 
fet it up on the Shore where I firft landed, viz. 7 
came on Shore here on the $otb of Sept. 1659. Upon 
the Sides of this fquare Poft I cut every Day a 
Notch with my Knife, and every feventh Notch 
was as long again as the reft, and every firft Day 
of the Month as long again as that long one, 
and thus I kept my Kalander, or weekly, month- 
ly, and yearly reckoning of Time. 

In the next place we are to obferve, that among 
the many things which I brought out of the Ship 
in the feveral Voyages, which, as above mention'd, 
I made to it, I got feveral things of left Value, 
but not all lefs ufeful to me, which I omitted fet- 
ting down before ; as in particular, Pens, Ink, and 
Paper, feveral Parcels in the Captain's, Mate's, 
Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or four 
Compaffes, fome Mathematical Inftruments, Dials, 
Perfpe<5tives, Charts, and Books of Navigation, 
all which I huddel'd together, whether I might 
want them or no; alfo I found three very good 
Bibles which came to me in my Cargo from Eng- 
land, and which I had pack'd up among my things ; 
fome Portugueze Books alfo, and among them two 

or 



c 



75 



or three Popifh Prayer-Books, and feveral other 
Books, all which I carefully fecur'd. And I muft 
not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and 
two Cats, of whofe eminent Hiftory I may have 
occafion to fay fomething in its place; for I 
carry'd both the Cats with me, and as for the 
Dog, he jump'd out of the Ship of himfelf and 
fwam on Shore to me the Day after I went on 
Shore with my firft Cargo, and was a trufty Ser- 
vant to me many Years ; I wanted nothing that he 
could fetch me, nor any Company that he could 
make up to me, I only wanted to have him talk to 
me, but that would not do : As I obferv'd before, 
I found Pen, Ink and Paper, and I husbanded them 
to the utmoft, and' I fhall fhew, that while my Ink 
lafted, I kept things very exaft, but after that was 
gone I could not, for I could not make any Ink by 
any Means that I could devife. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many 
things, notwithftanding all that I had amafs'd to- 
gether, and of thefe, this of Ink was one, as alfo 
Spade, Pick-Axe, and Shovel to dig or remove 
the Earth, Needles, Pins, and Thread; as for 
Linnen, I foon learn'd to want that without much 
Difficulty. 

This want of Tools made every Work I did go 
on heavily, and it was near a whole Year before I 
had entirely finifti'd my little Pale or furrounded 
Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as 
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cut- 
ting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far 
in bringing home, fo that I fpent fome times two 
Days in cuttting and bringing home one of thofe 
Pofts, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground; 
for which Purpofe I got a heavy Piece pf Wood 
at firft, but at laft bethought my felf of one of the 
Iron Crows, which however tho' I found it, yet 

it 



[76] 



it made driving thofe Pofts or Piles very labo- 
rious and tedi ous Work. 

But what need I ha* been concern'd at the Te- 
dioufnefs of any thing I had to do, feeing I had 
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other Em- 
ployment if that had been, over, at leaft, that I 
could forefee, except the ranging the Ifland to feek 
for Food, which I did more or lefe every Day. 

I now began to confider ferioufly my Condition, 
and the Circumftance I was reduc'd to, and I drew 
up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not fb much 
to leave them to any that were to come after me, 
for I was like to have but few Heirs, as to de- 
liver my Thoughts from daily poring upon them, 
and afflifting my Mind; and as my Reafon began 
now to mafter my Defporidency, I began to com- 
fort my felf as well as I could, and to let the good 
againft the Evil, that I might have fomething to 
diftinguifh my Cafe from worfe, and I ftated it 
very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the 
Comforts I enjoy'd, againft the Miferies I fuf- 
fer'd, Thus,

ble defolate IJland, void of 
all hop of Recovery.

But I am alive, and

Company was. 

But 1 amfingTd out too 
from all the Ship's Crew to

he that miraculoujlyfav'd 
me from Death , can deli- 
ver me from this Condition. 

But lam notftarv'dand

I have 



l77l 



I have not Clothes to co- 
ver me. 

I am without any De- 
fence or Means to rejift any 
Violence of Man or Beaft. 



I have no Soul tofpeak 
to, or relieve me. 



But I am in a hot Cli- 
mate ,wbere i jihad Clothes 
I could hardly wear them. 

But I am cajl on an I- 
Jland, where I fee no wild 
Beaft s to hurt me, as If aw 
on the Coaft of Africa: And 
what if I bad been Ship- 
wrecked there? 

But God wonderfully fent 
the Ship in near enough to 
the Shore, that I have got- 
ten out fo many neceffary 
things as will either fupply 
my Wants, or enable me 
to fupply my f elf even as 
long as I live. 



Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Tefti- 
mony, that there was fcarce any Condition in the 
World fo miferable, but there was fbmething Nega- 
tiv or fomething Pofttiv to be thankful for in it ; 
and let this ftand as a Direftion from the Experi- 
ence of the moft miferable of all Conditions in this 
World, that we may always find in it fomething 
to comfort our felves from, and to fet in the De- 
fcription of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side of 
the Accompt. 

Having now brought my Mind a little to relifti 
my 'Condition, and given over looking out to Sea 
to fee if I could fpy a Ship, I fay, giving over 
thefe things, I began to apply my felf to accommo- 
date my way of Living, and to make things as ea- 
fy to me as I could. 



I have 



[7«] 



I have already defcrib'd my Habitation, which 
was a Tent under the Side of a Rock, furrounded 
with a ftrong Pale of Pofts and Cables, but I might 
now rather call it a Wall, for I rais'd a kind of 
Wall up againft it of Turfs, about two Foot thick 
on the Out-fide, and after fome time, I think it 
was a Year and a Half, I rais'd Rafters from it lean- 
ing to the Rock, and thatch'd or cover 'd it with 
Bows of Trees, and fuch things as I could get to 
keep out the Rain, which I found at fome times 
of the Year very violent. 

I have already obferv'd how I broughr all my 
Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave which I 
had made behind me: But I muft obferve too, 
that at firft this was a confus'd Heap of Goods, 
which as they lay in no Order, fo they took up 
all my Place, I had no room to turn my felf; fo 
I fet my felf to enlarge my Cave and Works far- 
ther into the Earth, for it was a loofe fandy Rock, 
which yielded eafily to the Labour I beftow'd on 
it; and fo when I found I was pretty fafe as to 
Beafts of Prey, I work'd fide-ways to the Right 
Hand into the Rock, and then turning to the Right 
again, work'd quite out and made me a Door to 
come out, on the Out-fide of my Pale or Forti- 
fication. 

This gave me not only Egrefs and Regrefs, as 
it were a back Way to my Tent and to my Store- 
houfe, but gave me room to flow my Goods. 

And now I began to apply my felf to make fuch 
neceflary things as I found I moil wanted, as par- 
ticularly a Chair and a Table, for without thefe I 
was not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the 
World, I could not write, or eat, or do feveral 
things which fo much Pleafure without a Table. 

So I went to work ; and here I muft needs ob- 
ferve, that as Reafon is the Subftance and Origi- 
nal 



[79] 



nal of the Mathematicks, fo by ftating and fquar- 
ing every thing by Reafbn, and by making the 
moft rational Judgment of things, every Man may 
be in time Mafter of every mechanick Art. I had 
never handled a Tool in my Life, and yet in time 
by Labour, Application, and Contrivance, I found 
at laft that I wanted nothing but I could have 
made it, efpecially if I had had Tools ; however 
I made abundance of things, even without Tools, 
and fome with no more Tools than an Adze and 
a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made that 
way before, and that with infinite Labour: For 
Example, If I wanted a Board, I had no other Way 
but to cut down a Tree, fet it on an Edge before 
me, and hew it flat on either Side with my Axe, 
till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank, and 
then dubb it fmooth with my Adze. It is true, 
by this Method I could make but one Board out of 
a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy for but 
Patience, any more than I had for the prodigious 
deal of Time and Labour which it took me up to 
make a Plank or Board: But my Time or Labour 
was little worth, and fo it was as well employ 'd 
one way as another. 

However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as I 
obferv'd above, in the firft Place, and this I did 
out of the fhort Pieces of Boards that I brought 
on my Raft from the Ship: But when I had 
wrought out fome Boards, as above, I made large 
Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and Half one 
over another, all along one Side of my Cave, to 
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in a 
Word, to feparate every thing at large in their 
Places, that I muft come eafily at them; I knock'd 
Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns 
and all things that would hang up. 

' So 



[8o] 



So that had my Cave been to be feen, it look'd 
like a general Magazine of all Neceflary things, 
and I had every thing fo ready at my Hand, 
that it was a great Pleafure to me to fee all my 
Goods in fuch Order, and especially to find my 
Stock of all Neceflaries fo great. 

And now it was when I began to keep a Jour- 
nal of every Days Employment, for indeed at firft 
I was in too much Hurry, and not only Hurry 
as to Labour, but in too much Difcompofure of 
Mind, and my Journal would ha' been full of many 
dull things: For Example, I muft have faid thus. 
Sept. the 30th. After I got to Shore and had efcap'd 
drowning, inftead of being thankful to God for 
my Deliverance, having firft vomited with the 
great Quantity of fait Water which was gotten 
into my Stomach, and recovering my felf a little, I 
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands and beat- 
ing my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Mifery, 
and crying out, I was undone, undone, till tyr'd 
and faint I was forc'd to lye down on the Ground 
to repofe, but durft not fleep for fear of being de- 
vour'd. 

Some Days after this, and after I had been on 
board the Ship, and got all that I could out of 
her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top 
of a little Mountain and looking out to Sea in 
hopes of feeing a Ship, then fancy at a vaft Di- 
ftance I fpy'd a Sail, pleafe my felf with the Hopes 
of it, and then after looking fteadily till I was al- 
moft blind, lofe it quite, and fit down and weep- 
like a Child, and thus encreafe my Mifery by my 
Folly. 

But having gotten over thefe things in fome Mea- 
fure, and having fettled my houfhold Stuff" and Ha- 
bitation, made me a Table and a Chair, and all 
as handfome about me as I could, I began to keep 



[8i] 



my Journal, of which I fhall here give you the 
Copy (tho* in it will be told all thefe Particulars 
over again) as long as it lafted, for having no more 
Ink I was forc'd to leave it off. 

The JOURNAL. 

SEpt ember 30, 1659. I P 00r niiferable Robin/on 
Crufoe, being fliipwreck'd, during a dreadful 
Storm, in the offing, came on Shore on this difmal 
unfortunate Ifland, which I call'd the IJland of Def- 
pair, all the reft of the. Ship's Company being 
drown'd, and my felf almoft dead. 

All the reft of that Day I fpent in affli&ing my 
felf at the difmal Circumftances I was brought to, 
viz. I had neither Food, Houfe, Clothes, Weapon, or 
Place to fly to, and in Defpair of any Relief, faw 
nothing but Death before me, either that I fhould 
be devour'd by wild Beafts, murther'd by Savages, 
or ftarv'd to Death for Want of Food. At the 
Approach of Night, I flept in a Tree for fear of 
wild Creatures, but flept foundly tho' it rain'd all 
Night. 

Ofitober 1 . In the Morning I faw to my great Sur- 
prife the Ship had floated with the high Tide, 
and was driven on Shore again much nearer the 
Ifland, which as it was fome Comfort on one hand, 
for feeing her fit upright, and not broken to Pieces, 
I hop'd, if the Wind abated, I might get on board, 
and get fome Food aud Neceflaries out of her for 
my Relief; fo on the other hand, it renew'd my 
Grief at the Lofs of my Comrades, who I ima- 
ging if we had all ftaid on board might have 
fav'd the Ship, or at leaft that they would not have 
been all drown'd as they were ; and that had the 
Men been fav'd, we might perhaps have built us a 
Boat out of the Ruins of the Ship, to have car- 

G ried 



[8a] 



ried us to fome other Part of the World. I fpent 
great Part of this Day in perplexing my felf on 
thefe things ; but at length feeing the Ship almoft 
dry, I went upon the Sand as near as I could, and 
then fwam on board; this Day alfo it continu'd 
raining, tho' with no Wind at all. 

From the i ft of Sober, to the 24th. All thefe 
Days entirely fpent in many feveral Voyages to 
get all I could out of the Ship, which I brought 
on Shore, every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much 
Rain alfo in thefe Days, tho' with fome Intervals 
of fair Weather: But, it feems, this was the rainy 
Seafon. 

OS. 20. I overfet my Raft, and all the Goods 
I had got upon it, but being in (hoal Water, and 
the things being chiefly heavy, I recover 'd many 
of them when the Tide was out. 

OS. 25. It raind all Night and all Day, with 
fome Gufts of Wind, during which time the Ship 
broke in Pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder 
than before, and was no more to be feen, except 
the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water. 
I fpent this Day in covering and fecuring the Goods 
which I had fav'd, that the Rain might not fpoil 
them. 

OS. 26. I walk'd about the Shore almoft all 
Day to find out a place to fix my Habitation, 
greatly concern'd to iecure my felf from an Attack 
in the Night, either from wild Beafts or Men. 
Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper Place under 
a Rock, and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my En- 
campment, which I refolv'd to ftrengthen with a 
Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles, 
lin'd within with Cables, and without with Turf. 

From the 26th. to the 30th. I work'd very hard 
in carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation, 

tho' 



[«3] 



tho' fome Part of the time it rain'd exceeding 
hard 

The 31ft. in the Morning I went out into the 
Ifland with my Gun to fee for fome Food, and dif- 
-cover the Country, when I kill'd a She-Goat, and 
her Kid follow'd me home, which I afterwards 
kill'd alfo becaufe it would not feed. 

November 1 . I fet up my Tent under a Rock, and 
lay there for the firft Night, making it as large as 
I could with Stakes driven in to fwing my Ham- 
mock upon. 

Nov. 2. I fet up all my Chefts and Boards, and 
the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and 
with them form'd a Fence round me, a little with- 
in the Place I had mark'd out for my Purifica- 
tion. 

Nov, 3. I went out with my Gun and kill'd two 
Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food. 
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a 
Table. 

Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my times 
of Work, of going out with my Gun, time of Sleep, 
and time of Diverfion, viz. Every Morning I 
walk'd out with my Gun for two or three Hours 
if it did not rain, then employ'd my felf to work 
till about Eleven a-Clock, then eat what I had to 
live on, and from Twelve to Two I lay down to 
fleep, the Weather being exceflive hot, and then 
in the Evening to work ag&in : The working Part 
of this day and of the next were wholly employ'd 
in making my Table, for I was yet but a very forry 
Workman, tho* Time and Neceffity made me a 
-compleat natural Mechanick foon after, as I believe 
it would do any one elfe. 

Nov. 5. This Day went abroad with my Gun 
and my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat* her Skin 
pretty foft, but her Flefli good for nothing : Every 

G 2 Creature 



[84] 



Creature I kill'd I took off the Skins and preferv'd 
them : Coming back by the Sea Shore, I faw many- 
Sorts of Sea Fowls which I did not underftand, but 
was furpris'd and almoft frighted with two or three 
Seals, which, while I was gazing at, not well 
knowing what they were, got into the Sea and 
efcap'd me for that time. 

Nov. 6. After my Morning Walk I went to work 
with my Table again, and finifh'd it, tho* not to 
my liking ; nor was it long before I learn'd to mend 

it- 

Nov. 7. Now it began to be fettled fair Weather. 

The 7th, 8th, 9th, ioth-, and Part of the 12th. 

(for the nth. was Sunday) I took wholly up to 

make me a Chair, and with much ado brought 

it to a tolerable Shape, but never to pleafe me, 

and even in the making I pull'd it in Pieces fe- 

veral times. Note^ I foon negle<5ted my keeping 

Sundays, for omitting my Mark for them on my 

Poft, I forgot which was which. 

Nov. 13. This Day it rain'd, which refrefh'd me 
exceedingly, and cool'd the Earth, but it was ac- 
company'd with terrible Thunder and Lightning, 
which frighted me dreadfully for fear of my Pow- 
der ; as foon as it was over, I refolv'd to feparate 
my Stock of Powder into as many little Parcels as 
poflible, that it might not be in Danger. 

Nov. 14, 15, 16. Th'efe three Days Tfpentin 
making little fquare Chefts or Boxes, which might 
hold about a Pound or two Pound, at moft, of 
Powder, and fo putting the Powder in, I ftow'd 
it in Places as fectfre and remote from one another 
as poflible. On one of thefe three Days I kijFd 
a large Bird that was good to eat, but I know not 
what to call it. 

Nov. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my 
Tent into the Rock to make room for my farther 

Conve- 



[85] 



Conveniency: Note, Two Things I wanted ex- 
ceedingly for this Work, viz. A Pick-axe, a Shovel, 
and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, fo I defifted from 
my Work, and began to confider how to fupply 
that Want and make me fome Tools; as for a 
Pick-axe, I made ufe of the Iron Crows, which 
were proper enough, tho' heavy; but the next 
thing was a Shovel or Spade, this was fo abfo- 
lutely neceflary, that indeed I could do nothing 
effectually without it, but what kind of one to 
make I knew not. 

Nov. 1 8. The next Day in fearching the Woods 
I found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which, 
in the Braftls they call the Iron Tree, for its ex- 
ceeding Hardness, of this, with great Labour and 
almoft fpoiling my Axe, I cut a Piece, and brought 
it home too with Difficulty enough, for it was ex- 
ceeding heavy. 

The exceflive Hardnefs of the Wood, and having 
no other Way, made me a long while upon this 
Machine, for I work'd it effectually by little 
and little into the Form of a Shovel or Spade, 
the Handle exa&ly fhap'd like ours in England, 
only that the broad Part having no Iron fliod up- 
on it at Bottom, it would not laft me fo long, 
however it ferv'd well enough for the ufes which I 
had occasion to put it to ; but never was a Shovel, 
I believe, made after that Fafhion, or fo long a 
making. 

I was ftill deficient, for I wanted a Basket or a 
Wheel-barrow, a Basket I could not make by any 
Means, having no fuch things as Twigs that would 
bend to make Wicker Ware, at leaft none yet found 
out ; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy'd I could 
make all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion 
of, neither did I know how to go about it; befides 
I had no poffible Way to make the Iron Gudgeons 

G 3 fo 



[86] 



for the Spuidle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, fo 
I gave it over, and fo for carrying away the Earth 
which I dug out of the Cave, I made me a Thing 
like a Hodd, which the Labourers carry Morter 
in, when they ferve the Bricklayers. 

This was not fo difficult to me as the making 
the Shovel; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the 
Attempt which I made in vain, to make a Wheel- 
Barrow, took me up no lefs than four Days, I mean 
always, excepting my Morning Walk with my 
Gun, which I feldom fail'd, and very feldom fail'd 
alfo bringing Home fomething fit to eat. 

Nov. 23 .My other Work having now ftood ftill, 
becaufe of my making thefe Tools; when they 
were finifh'd, I went on, and working every Day, 
as my Strength and Time allow'd, I fpent eigh- 
teen Days entirely in widening and deepening my 
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodi- 
oufly . 

Note, During all this Time, I work'd to make 
this Room or Cave fpacious enough to accommo- 
date me as a Warehoufe or Magazin, a Kitchen, 
a Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging, 
I kept to the Tent, except that fome Times in the 
wet Seafon of the Year, it rain'd fo hard, that 
I could not keep my felf dry, which caufed me af- 
terwards to cover all my Place within my Pale 
with long Poles in the Form of Rafters leaning 
againft the Rock, and load them with Flaggs and 
large Leaves of Trees like a Thatch. 

December 10th, I began now to think my Cave 
or Vault finiflied, when on a Sudden, (it feems I 
had made it too large) a great Quantity of Earth 
fell down from the Top and one Side, fo much, 
that in fhort it frighted me, and not without Rea- 
fon too ; for if I had been under it I had never 
wanted a-Grave-Digger : Upon this Difafter I had 

a great 



C«7] 



a great deal of Work to do over again ; for I had 
the loofe Earth to carry out; and which was of 
more Importance, I had the Selling to prop up, fo 
that I might be fure no more would come down. 

Dec. 1 1. This Day I went to Work with it accor- 
dingly, and got two Shores or Pofts pi tch'd upright 
to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-crofs over 
eachPoft,thisIfinifh'd the next Day; and fettingmore 
Pofts up with Boards, in about a week more I had 
the Roof fecur'd ; and the Pofts ftanding in Rows, 
ferv'd me for Partitions to part of my Houfe. 

Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I 
plac'd Shelves, and knock'd up Nails on the Pofts 
to hang every Thing up that could be hung up, 
and now I began to be in fome Order within 
Doors. 

Dec. 20. Now I carry 'd every Thing into the 
Cave, and began to furnifh my Houfe, and fet up 
fome Pieces of Boards, like a Drefler, to order my 
Vi&uals upon, but Boards began to be very fcarce 
with ,me ; alfo I made me another Table. 

Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day, no 
ftirring out. 

Dec. 1$* Rain all Day. 

Dec. 26. No Rain, and the Earth much cooler 
than before, and pleafanter. 

Dec. 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd ano- 
ther fo as that I catch *d it, and led it Home in a 
String; when I had it Home, I bound and fplin- 
tered up its Leg which was broke, N B. I 
took fuch Care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg 
grew well, and as ftrong as ever ; but by my nur- 
fing it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the lit- 
tle Green at my Door, and would not go away : 
This was the firft Time that I entertain'd a 
Thought of breeding up fome tame Creatures, 

G 4 that 



[88] 



that I might have Food when my Powder and Shot 
was all fpent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; 
fo that there was no Stirring abroad, except in the 
Evening for Food ; this Time I fpcnt in putting 
all my Things in Order within Doors. 

yauuary 1 . Very hot ftill, but I went abroad ear- 
ly and late with my Gun, and lay ftill in the Middle 
of the Day ; this Evening going farther into the 
Valleys which lay towards the Center of the Ifland, 
I found there was plenty of Goats, tho* exceeding 
fhy and hard to come at, however I refolv'd to 
try if I could not bring my Dog to hunt them down. 

yan. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went 

out with my Dog, and fet him upon the Goats ; 

but I was miftaken, for they all fac'd about upon 

. the Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he 

would not come near them. 

yan. 3. I began my Fence or Wall ; which be- 
ing ftill jealous of my being attack'd by fome Bo- 
dy, I refolv'd to make very thick and ftrong. 

N. B. This Wall being deJcriVd before, I 

purpofely omit what was [aid in the your- 

nal\ it isfufficient to ob/erve, that I was no 

lejs Time than from the 3d of January to 

the 14th of April, working, finifhing> and 

perfecting this Wall> tho 9 it was no more than 

about 24 Yards in Length y being a half Circle 

from one Place in the Rock to another Place 

about eight Yards from it y the Door of the 

Cave being in the Center behind it. 

All this Time I work'd very hard, the Rains 
hindering me many Days, nay fometimes Weeks 
together ; but I thought I ihould never be perfect- 
ly fecure 'till this Wall was finifh'd ; and it is 

fcarce 



C«9] 



fcarce credible what inexpreflible Labour every 
Thing was done with, efpecially the bringing Piles 
out of the Woods, and driving them into the 
Ground, for I made them much bigger than I need 
to have done. 

When this Wall was finifhed, and the Out-fide 
double fenc'd with a Turff-Wall rais'd up clofe to 
it, I perfwaded my felf, that if any People were to 
come on Shore there, they would not perceive any 
Thing like a Habitation ; and it was very well I 
did fo, as may be obferv'd hereafter upon a very 
remarkable Occafion. 

During this Time, I made my Rounds in the 
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain admit- 
ted me, and made frequent Difcoveries in thefe 
Walks of fomething or other to my Advantage ; 
particularly I found a Kind of wild Pidgeons, who 
built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather 
as Houfe Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks ; 
and taking fome young ones, I endeavoured to 
bread them up tame, and did fo ; but when they 
grew older they flew all away, which perhaps was 
at firft for Want of feeding them, for I had no- 
thing to give them ; however I frequently found 
their Nefts, and got their young ones, which were 
very good Meat. 

And now, in the managing my houfhold Affairs, 
I found my felf wanting in many Things, which 
I thought at firft it was impoflible for me to make, 
as indeed as to fome of them it was ; for Inftance, 
I could never make a Cask to be hooped, I had a 
fmall Runlet or two, as I obferved before^ but I cou'd 
never arrive to the Capacity of making one by them, 
tho' I fpent many Weeks about it ; I could neither 
put in the Heads, or joint the Staves fo true to one 
another, as to make them hold Water, fo I gave 

that alfo over.

In the next Place, I was at a great Lofs for 
Candle ; fo that as foon as ever it was dark, which 
was generally by Seven-a-Clock, I was oblig'd to 
go to Bed : I remembred the Lump of Bees-wax 
with which I made Candles in my African Ad- 
venture, but I had none of that now ; the only Re- 
medy I had was, that when I had kill'd a Goat, I 
fav'd the Tallow, and with a little Difh made of 
Clay, which I bak'd in the Sun, to which I added 
a Wick of fome Oakum, I made me a Lamp ; and 
this gave me Light, tho' not a clear fteady Light 
like a candle; in the Middle of all my Labours it 
happen'd, that rumaging my Things, I found a 
little Bag, which, as I hinted before, had been 
fill'd with Corn for the feeding of Poultry, not for 
this Voyage, but before, as I fuppofe, when the 
Ship came from Lisbon^ what little Remainder of 
Corn had been in the Bag, was all devour'd with the 
Rats, and I faw nothing in the Bag but Husks and 
Duft ; and being willing to have the Bag for fome 
other Ufe, I think it was to put Powder in, when 
I divided it for Fear of the Lightning, or fome fuch 
Ufe, I fhook the Husks of Corn out of it on one 
Side of my Fortification under the Rock. 

It was a little before the great Rains, juft now 
mention'd, that I threw this Stuff away, taking no 
Notice of any Thing and not fo much as remem- 
bring that I had thrown any Thing there ; when 
about a Month after, or thereabout, I faw lome 
few Stalks of fomething green, fhooting out of the 
Ground, which I fancy 'd might be foma» Plant I 
had not feen, but I was furpriz'd and perfe&ly afto- 
nifh'd, when, after a little longer Time, I faw a- 
bout ten or twelve Ears come out, which were 
perfeft green Barley of the fame Kind as our Euro- 
pean> nay, as our Englijh Barley. 

It 



[9i] 



It is impoffible to exprefs the Aftonifhment and 
Confufion of my Thoughts on this Occafion ; I 
had hitherto a&ed upon no religious Foundation at 
all, indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in 
my Head, or had entertain'd any Senfe of any 
Thing that had befallen me, otherwife than as a 
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, what pleafes God ; 
without fo much as enquiring into the End of 
Providence in thefe Things, or his Order in go- 
verning Events in the World : But after I faw Bar- 
ley grow there, in a Climate which I know was 
not proper for Corn, and efpecially that I knew 
not how it came there, it ftartl'd me ftrangely, 
and I began to fuggeft, that God had miraculoufly 
caus'd this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed 
ibwn, and that it was fo dire&ed purely for my 
Suftenance, on that wild miferable Place. 

This touch'd my Heart a little, and brought 
Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to blefs my 
felf, that fuch a Prodigy of Nature fhould hap- 
pen upon my Account; and this was the more 
ftrange to me, becaufe I faw near it ftill all along 
by the Side of the Rock, fomeother ftraggling Stalks, 
which prov'd to be Stalks of Ryce, and which I 
knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa when 
I was afliore there. 

I not only thought thefe the pure Produ<5Hons 
of Providence for my Support, but not doubting, 
but that there was more in the Place, I went all 
over that Part of the Ifland, where I had been 
before, peering in every Corner, and under every 
Rock, to fee for more of it, but I could not find 
any ; at laft it occur 'd to my Thoughts, that I had 
fhook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place, 
and then the Wonder began to ceafe ; and I muft 
confefs, my religious Thankfulnefs to God's Pro- 
vidence began to abate too upon the Difcove- 
ring that all this was nothing but what was 



[$>*] 



common ; tho* I ought to have been as thankful 
for fo ftrange and uniorfeen Providence, as if it had 
been miraculous ; for it was really the Work of 
Providence as to me, that fliould order or appoint, 
that ioor 12 Grains of Corn fliould remuin un- 
fpoil'd, (when the Rats had deftroy'd all the reft,) 
as if it had been dropt from Heaven ; as alfo, that 
I fliould throw it out in that particular Place, 
where it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it 
fprang up immediately ; whereas, if I had thrown 
it anywhere elfe, at that Time, it had been burnt 
up and deftroy'd. 

I carefully fav'd the Ears of this Corn you maybe 
fure in their Seafon, which was about the End of 
yum ; and laying up every Corn, I refolv'd to fow 
them all again, hoping in Time to have fome 
Quantity fufHcient to fupply me with Bread ; But it 
was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my felf 
the leaft Grain of this Corn to eat, and even then 
but fparingly, as I fliall fay afterwards in its Or- 
der ; for I loft all that I fow'd the firft Seafon, by 
. not obferving the proper Time ; for I fow'd it juft 
before the dry Seafon, fo that it never came up 
at all, at leaft, not as it would ha' done : Of which 
in its Place. 

Befides this Barley, there was, as above, 20 or 
30 Stalks of Ryce, which I preferv'd with the fame 
Care, and whofe Ufe was of the fame Kind or 
to the fame Purpofe, (viz.) to make me Bread, or 
rather Food ; for I found Ways to cook it up with- 
out baking, tho' I did that alfo after fome Time. 
But to return to my Journal, 

I TfVork'd exceflive hard thefe three or four 
Months to get my Wall done ; and the 14th of 
April I clofed it up, contriving to go into it, not 
by a Door, but over the Wall by a Ladder, that 

there 



[93] 



there might be no Sign in the Out-fide of my Ha- 
bitation. 

Jpril 1 6. I finifh'd the Ladder, fo I went up 
with the Ladder to the Top, and then pulPd it up 
after me, and let it down in the In-fide: This 
was a compleat Enclofure to me ; for within I had 
Room enough, and nothing could come at me from 
without, unlefs it could firfl: mount my Wall. 

The very next Day after this Wall was finifh'd, 
I had almoft had all my Labour overthrown at 
once, and my felf kilPd, the Cafe was thus, As I 
was bufy in the Infide of it, behind my Tent, juft 
in the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly 
frighted with a moft dreadful furprifing Thing in- 
deed ; for all on a fudden I found the Earth come 
crumbling down from the Roof of my Cave, and 
from the Edge of the Hill over my Head, and 
two of the Polls I had fet up in the Cave crack'd 
in a frightful Manner ; I was heartily fcar'd, but 
thought nothing of what was really the Caufe, only 
thinking that the Top of my Cave was falling in, 
as fome of it had done before; andforFear Ifhou'dbe 
bury'd in it, I run foreward to my Ladder, and 
not thinking my felf fafe there neither; I got over 
my Wall for Fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I 
expe&ed might roll down upon me : I was no foon- 
er ftepp'd down upon the firm Ground, but I plain- 
ly faw it was a terrible Earthquake, for the Ground 
I flood on fhook three Times at about eight Mi- 
nutes Diftance, with three fuch Shocks, as would 
have overturn'd the ftrongeft Building that could 
be fuppos'd to have ftood on the Earth, and a 
great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which ftood a- 
bout half a Mile from me next the Sea, fell down 
with fuch a terrible Noife, as I never heard in all 
my Life, I perceiv'd alfo, the very Sea was put 
into violent Motion by it; and I believe the 

Shocks 



[94] 



Shocks were ftronger under the Water than on the 
Ifland, 

I was fo amaz'd with the Thing it felf, having 
never felt the like, or difcours'd with any one that 
had, that I was like one dead or ftupify'd ; and 
the Motion of the Earth made my Stomach fick 
like one that was tofs'd at Sea ; but the Noife of 
the falling of the Rock awak'd me as it were, and 
routing me from the ftupify'd Condition I was in, 
fiird me with Horror, and I thought of nothing 
then but the Hill falling upon my Tent and all my 
houfhold Goods, and burying all at once; and 
this funk my very Soul within me a fecond Time. 

After the third Shock was over, and I felt no 
more for fome Time, I began to take Courage, and 
yet I had not Heart enough to go over my Wall 
again, for Fear of being buried alive, but fat 
ftill upon the Ground, greatly caft down and dif- 
confolate, not knowing what to do: All this 
while I had not the leaft ferious religious Thought, 
nothing but the common, Lord ba' Mercy upon me ; 
and when it was over, that went away too. 

While I fat thus, I found the Air over-caft, 
and grow cloudy, as if it would Rain ; foon af- 
ter that the Wind rofe by little and little, fo that, 
in lefs than half an Hour, it blew a moft dreadful 
Hurricane : The Sea was all on a Sudden cover 'd 
over w;th Foam and Froth, the Shore was cover'd 
with the Breach of the Water, the Trees were 
torn up by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was ; 
and this held about three Hours, and then began to 
abate, and in two Hours more it was ftark calm, 
and began to rain very hard. 

All this while I fat upon the Ground very much 
terrify'd and deje&ed, when on a fudden it came 
into my thoughts, that thefe Winds and Rain being 
the Confequencesof the Earthquake, the Earthquake 

it felf 



[95] 



it felf was fpent and over, and I might venture into 
my Cave again: With this Thought my Spirits 
began to revive, and the Rain alfo helping to per- 
fwade mq, I went in and fat down in my Tent, 
but the Rain was fo violent, that my Tent was 
ready to be beaten down with it, and I was forc'd 
to go into my Cave, tho' very much affraid and 
uneafy for fear it fhould fall on my Head. 

This violent Rain forc'd me to a new Work, 
viz. To cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification 
like a Sink to let the Water go out, which would 
elfe have drown'd my Cave. After I had been in 
my Cave fome time, and found ftill no more Shocks 
of the Earthquake follow, I began to be more com- 
pos'd; and now to fupport my Spirits, which indeed 
wanted it very much, I went to my little Store 
and took a fmall Sup of Rum, which however I 
did then and always very fparingly, knowing I 
could have no more when that was gone. 

It continu'd raining all that Night, and great 
Part of the next Day, fo that I could not ftir a- 
broad, but my Mind being more compos'd, I be- 
gan to think of what I had beft do, concluding 
that if the Ifland was fubjedt to thefe Earthquakes, 
there would be no living for me in a Cave, but I 
muft confider of building me fome little Hut in an 
open Place which I might furround with a Wall as 
I had done here, and fo make my felf fecure from 
wild Beafts or Men; but concluded, if I (laid 
where I was, I fhould certainly, one time or other, 
be bury'd alive. 

With thoe Thoughts I refolv'd to remove my 
Tent frpm the Place where it flood, which was 
juft under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and 
which, if it fhould be fhaken again, would certain- 
ly fall upon my Tent : And I fpent the two next 

Days, 



[96] 



Days, being the 19th and 20th of Aprils in con- 
triving where and how to remove my Habitation. 

The fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made me 
that I never flept in quiet, and yet the Apprehen- 
sions of lying abroad without any Fence was almoft 
equal to it; but ftill when I look'd about and faw 
how every thing was put in order, how pleafantly 
conceaTd I was, and how fafe from Danger, it made 
me very loath to remove. 

In the mean time it occur'd to me that it would 
require a vaft deal of time for me to do this, and 
that I muft be contented to run the Venture where 
I was, till I had form'd a Camp for my felf, and 
had fecur'd it fo as to remove to it : So with this 
Refolution I compos'd my felf for a time, and re- 
folv'd that I would go to work with all Speed to 
build me a Wall with Piles and Cables, &V. in a 
Circle as before, and fet my Tent up in it when it 
was finifli'd, but that I would venture to ftay where 
I was till it was finifh'd and fit to remove to. This 
was the 21ft. 

April 22. The next Morning I began to confider 
of Means to put this Refolve in Execution, but I 
was at a great lofs about my Tools; I had three 
large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we 
carried the Hatchets for Traffick with the Indians) 
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard 
Wood, they were all full of Notches and dull, 
and tho' I had a Grindftone, I could not turn it and 
grind my Tools too, this coft me as much Thought 
as a Statefman would have beftow'd upon a grand 
Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Life and 
Death of a Man. At length I contriv'd a Wheel 
with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I 
might have both my Hands at Liberty : blote, I had 
never feen any fuch thing in England, or at leaft 
not to take Notice how it was done, tho' fince I 

have 



l97l 



have obferv'd it is very common there: befides 
that, my Grindftone was very large and heavy. 
This Machine coft me a full Weeks Work to bring 
it to Perfe&ion. 

April 28, 29. Thefe two whole Days I took 
up in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turn- 
ing my Grindftone performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceiv'd my Bread had been 
low a- great while, now I took a Survey of it, 
and reduc'd my felf to one Bisket-cake a Day, 
which made my Heart very heavy. 

May 1. In the Morning looking towards the 
Sea-fide, the Tide being low, I faw fomething lye 
on the Shore bigger than ordinary, and it look'd 
like a Cask, when I came to it, I found a fmall 
Barrel, and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of 
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late 
Hurricane, and looking towards the Wreck itfelf, 
I thought it feem'd to lye higher out of the Wa- 
ter than it us'd to do ; I examin'd the Barrel which 
was driven on Shore, and foon found it was a 
Barrel of Gunpowder, but it had taken Water, 
and the Powder was cak'd as hard as a Stone, how- 
ever I roll'd it farther on Shore for the prefent, and 
went on upon the Sands as near as I could to the 
Wreck of the Ship to lo.ok for more. 

When I came down to the Ship I found it ftrange- 
ly remov'd, The Fore-caftle which lay before bu- 
. ry'd in Sand, was heav'd up at leaft Six Foot, and 
the Stern which was broke to Pieces and parted 
from the reft by the Force of the Sea foon after I 
had left rummaging her, was tofs'd, as it were, up, 
and caft on one Side, and the Sand was thrown 
fo high on that Side next her Stern, that whereas 
there was a great Place of Water before, fo that I 
could not come within a Quarter of a Mile of the 
Wreck without fwimming, I could now walk 

H quite 



[9«] 



quite up to her when the Tide was out ; I was fur- 
pris'd with this at firft, but foon concluded it muft be 
done by the Earthquake, and as by this Violence the 
Ship was more broken open than formerly , fo ma- 
ny Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea had 
loofen'd, and which the Winds and Water rolled 
by Degrees to the Land, 

This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the 
Defign of removing my Habitation; and I bufied 
my felf mightily that Day efpecially, in fearching 
whether I could make any Way into the Ship, but I 
found nothing was to be expe&ed of that Kind, for 
that all the In-fide of the Ship was choack'd up 
with Sand : However, as I had learn'd not to defpair 
of any Thing, I refolv'd to pull every Thing to 
Pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding, that 
every Thing I could get from her would be of 
fome Ufe or other to me. 

May 3. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece 
of a Beam thro', which I thought held fome of the 
upper Part or Quarter-Deck together, and when 
I had cut it thro', I clear'd away the Sand as well 
as I could from the Side which lay higheft ; but 
the Tide coming in, I was oblig'd to give over for 
that Time. 

May 4. I went a fifhing, but caught not one Fifh 
that I durft eat of, till I was weary of my Sport, 
when juft going to leave off, I caught a young 
Dolphin. I had made me a long Line of fome 
Rope Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently 
caught Fifh enough, as much as I car'd to eat; 
all which I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry. 

May 5. Work'd on the Wreck, cut another 
Beam afunder, and brought three great Fir Planks 
off from the Decks, which I ty'd together, and 
made fwim on Shore when the Tide of Flood came 
on. 

May 



[99] 



May 6. Work'd on the Wreck, got feveral Iron 
Bolts out of her, and other Pieces of Iron Work, 
work'd very hard, and came Home very much 
tyr'd, and had Thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an 
Intent not to work, but found the Weight of the 
Wreck had broke itfelf down, the Beams being cut, 
that feveral Pieces of the Ship feem'd to lie Toofe, 
and the In-fide of the Hold lay fo open, that I 
could fee into it, but almoft full of Water and Sand. 

May 8. Went to the Wreck, andcarry'd an Iron 
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now 
quite clear of the Water or Sand; I wrench'd open 
two Planks, and brought them on Shore alio with 
the Tide : I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for 
next Day. 

May 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow 
made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and felt 
ieveral Casks, and loofen'd them with the Crow, 
but could not break them up; I felt alfo the 
Roll of Englijh Lead, and could ftir it, but it was 
too heavy to remove. 

May 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Went every Day to 
the Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Tim- 
ber, and Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 Weight of 
Iron. 

May 15. I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I 
could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by 
placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and driving it 
with the other ; but, as it lay about a Foot and a 
half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to 
drive the Hatchet. 

May 16. It had blow'd hard in the Night, and 
the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of 
the Water ; but I ftay'd fo long in the Woods to get 
Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented me 
going to the Wreck that Day. 

H 2 May 



[ioo] 

May 17. I faw fome Pieces of the Wreck blown on 
Shore, at a great Diftance, near two Miles off me, 
but refolv'd to fee what they were, and found it 
was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me to 
bring away. 

May 24. Every Day to this Day I workM on 
the Wreck, and with hard Labour I loofen'd fome 
Things fo much with the Crow, that the firft 
blowing Tide feveral Casks floated out, and two 
of the Seamens Chefts ; but the Wind blowing from 
the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but 
Pieces of Timber, and a Hogftiead which had fome 
Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand 
had fpoiTd it. 

I continu'd this Work every Day to the 15th of 
June, except the Time neceffary to get Food, 
\vhich I always appointed, during this Part of my 
Employment, to be when the Tide was up, that I 
might be ready when it was ebb'd out, and by this 
Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron- 
Work enough, to have builded a good Boat, if I 
had known how ; and alfo, I got at feveral Times, 
and in feveral Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet- 
Lead. 

June 16. Going down to the Sea-fide, I found 
a large Tortoife or Turtle ; this was the firft I had 
feen, which it feems was only my Misfortune, not 
any Defeft of the Place, or Scarcity ; for had I hap- 
pen'd to be on the other Side of the Ifland, I 
might have had Hundreds of them every Day, as 
I found afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear 
enough for them. 

June 17. I fpent in cooking the Turtle; I 
found in her threefcore Eggs ; and her Flefh was to 
me at that Time the moft favoury and pleafant 
that ever I tafted in my Life, having had no Flefh,. 

but 



["I] 



but of Goats and Fowls, fince I landed in this hor- 
rid Place. 

June iS. Rain'd all Day, and I ftay'd within. 
I thought at this Time the Rain felt Cold, and I 
was fomething chilly, which I knew was not ufual 
in that Latitude. 

June 19. Very ill, and fliivering, as if the Wea- 
ther had been cold. 

June 20. No Reft all Night, violent Pains in 
my Head, and feaverifh. 

June 21. Very ill, frighted almoft to Death 
with the Apprehenfions of my fad Condition, to 
be fick, and no Help : Pray'd to GOD for the 
firft Time fince the Storm off of Hull, but fcarce 
knew what I faid, or why ; my Thoughts being all 
confufed. 

June 22. A little better, but under dreadful 
Apprehenfions of Sickness. 

June 23. Very bad again, cold and fhivering, 
and then a violent Head-ach. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An Ague very violent ; the Fit held 
me feven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint 
Sweats after it. 

June 26. Better; and having no Viduals to eat, 
took my Gun, but found my self very weak; 
however I kill'd a She-Goat, and with much Dif- 
ficulty got it Home, and broil'd fbme of it, and 
eat ; I wou'd fain have ftew'd it, and made fome 
Broath, but had no Pot. 

June 27. The Ague again ib violent, that I 
lay a-Bed all Day, and neither eat or drank. I 
was ready to perifti for Thirft, but fo weak, I had 
not Strength to ftand up, or to get my felf any 
Water to drink : Pray'd to God again, but was 
light-headed, and when I was not, I was fo igno- 
rant, that I knew not what to fay ; only I lay and 

H 3 cry'd, 



[ I0 *] 



cry'd, Lord look upon me, Lord pity me> Lord have 
Mercy upon me : I fuppofe I did nothing elfe for two 
or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, I fell afleep, 
and did not wake till far in the Night; when I wak'd, 
I found my felf much refrefh'd, but weak, and ex- 
ceeding thirsty : However, as I had no Water in 
my whole Habitation, I was forc'd to lie till Mor- 
ning, and went to fleep again : In this fecond Sleep, 
I had this terrible Dream. 

I thought, that I was fitting on the Ground on 
the Out-fide of my Wall, where I fat when the 
Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that I faw 
a Man defcend from a great black Cloud, in a 
bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the ground : 
He was all over as bright as a Flame, fo that I 
could but juft bear to look towards him ; his 
Countenance was moft inexpreflibly dreadful, 
impoflible for Words to defcribe ; when he ftepp'd 
upon the Ground with his Feet, I thought the 
Earth trembl'd, juft as it had done before in the 
Earthquake, and all the Air look'd, to my Appre- 
henfion, as if it had been fill'd with Flafties of Fire. 

He was no fooner landed upon the Earth, but 
he moved forward towards me, with a long Spear 
or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me ; and when he 
came to a riling Ground, at fome Diftance, he 
fpoke to me, or I heard a Voice fb terrible, that 
it is impoflible to express the Terror of it ; all that 
r can fay, I underftood, was this, Seeing all thefe 
Things have not brought thee to Repent ance^now thou (halt 
die : At which Words, I thought he lifted up the 
Spear that was in his Hand, to kill me. 

No one, that (hall ever read this Account, wilt 
expeA that I fhould be able to defcribe the Horrors 
of my Soul at this terible Vifion, I mean, that even 
while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of thofe 
Horrors ; nor is it any more poflible to defcribe 

the 



L io 3] 



the Impreffion that remain'd upon my Mind when I 
awak'd and found it was but a Dream. 

I had alas ! no divine Knowledge ; what I had re- 
ceived by the goodlnftruftion of my Father was then 
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of 
Seafaring Wickednefe, and a conftant Converfation 
with nothing but fuch as were like my felf, wicked 
and prophane to the laft Degree : I do not remember 
that I had in all that Time one Thought that fo 
much as tended either to looking upwards toward 
God, or inwards towards a Reflection upon my 
own Ways : But a certain Stupidity of Soul, with- 
out Defire of Good, or Conscience of Evil, had 
entirely overwhelm'd me, and I was all that the moil 
hardned, unthinking, wicked Creature among our 
common Sailors, can be fuppofed to be, not having 
the leaft Senfe, either of the Fear of God in Danger, 
or of Thankfulnefs to God in Deliverances. 

In the relating what is already paft of my Story, 
this will be the more eafily believ'd, when I fhall 
add, that thro' all the Variety of Miferies that 
had to this Day befallen me, I never had fa much 
as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or 
that it was a juft Punifhment for my Sin ; my re- 
bellious Behaviour againft my Father, or my pre- 
fent Sins which were great ; or fo much as a Pu- 
nifhment for the general Courfe of my wicked Life. 
When I was on the defperate Expedition on the de- 
fart Shores of Africa^ I never had fo much as one 
Thought of what would become of me ; or one 
Willi to God to direA me whether I fhould go, or to 
keep me from the Danger which apparently fur- 
rounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as 
cruel Savages : But I was meerly thoughtlefs of a 
God, or a Providence ; afted like a meer Brute 
from the Principles of Nature, and by the Diftates 
of common Senfe only, and indeed hardly that. 

H 4 When 



[ I0 4] 



When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by the 
Portugal Captain, well us'd, and dealt juftly and 
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not 
the leaft Thankfulnefs on my Thoughts : When 
again I was fhipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in Danger of 
drowning on this Ifland, I was as far from Re- 
morfe, or looking on it as a Judgment ; I only faid 
to my felf often, that I was an unfortunate Dog, and 
born to be always miferable. 

It is true, when I got on Shore firft here, and 
found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and my 
felf fpar'd, I was furpriz'd with a Kind of Extafie, 
and fome Tranfports of Soul, which, had the Grace 
of God aflifted, might have come up to true Thank- 
fulnefs ; but it ended where it begun, in a meer 
common Flight of Joy, or as I may fay, being glad 1 
was alive, without the leaft Refledlion upon the 
diftingui thing Goodnefs of the Hand which had 
preferv'd me, and had fingled me out to be pre- 
ferv'd, when all the reft were deftroy'd ; or an En- 
quiry why Providence had been thus merciful to 
me ; even juft the fame common Sort of Joy which 
Seamen generally have after they are got fafe afhore 
from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in the next 
Bowl of Punch, and forget almoft as foon as it is 
over, and all the reft of my Life was like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due Confide- 
ration, made fenfible of my Condition, how I was 
caft on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of hu- 
mane Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Profpedt 
of Redemption, as foon as I faw but a Profped: of 
living, and that I fhould not ftarve and perifli for 
Hunger, all the Senfe of my Affl <5tion wore off, 
and I begun to be very eafy, apply'd my felf to the 
Works proper for my Prefervation and Supply, and 
was far enough from being afflidted at my Con- 
dition, as a Judgment from Heaven, or as th e 

Hand 



["S3 



Hand of God againft me ; thefe were Thoughts 
which very feldom enter'd into my Head. 

The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in 
my Journal, had at firft fome little Influence upon 
me, and began to affecft me with Serioufnefs, as 
long as I thought it had fomething miraculous in 
it ; but as foon as ever that Part of the Thought 
was remov'd, all the Impreflion which was rais'd 
from it, wore off alfo, as I have noted already. 

Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be 
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately 
directing to the Invifible Power which alone di- 
rects fuch Things, yet no fooner was the firft Fright 
over, but the Impreflion it had made went off alfo. 
I had no more Senfe of God or his Judgments, 
much lefs of the prefent AfHidion of my Circum- 
ftances being from his Hand, than if I had been in 
the moft profperous Condition of Life. 

But now when I began to be fick, and a leifure- 
ly View of the Miferies of Death came to place it- 
felf before me ; when my Spirits began to fink un- 
der the Burthen of a ftrong Diftemper, and Nature 
was exhaufted with the Violence of the Feaver ; 
Confcience that had flept fo long, begun to awake, 
and I began to reproach my .felf with my paft Life, 
in which I had fo evidently, by uncommon Wicked- 
nefs, provok'd the Juftice of God to lay me under 
uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in fo vin- 
dictive a Manner. 

Thefe Refleftions opprefs'd me for the fecond or 
third Day of my Diftemper, and in the Violence, 
as well of the Feaver, as of the dreadful Reproaches 
of my Confcience, extorted fome Words from me, 
like praying to God, tho' I cannot fay they were 
either a Prayer attended with De fires or with 
Hopes ; it was rather the Voice of meer Fright 
and Diftrefs; my Thoughts were confus'd, the 

Convi- 



[io6] 



Convi&ions great upon my Mind, and the Horror 
of dying in fuch a miferable Condition rais'd Va- 
pours into my Head with the meer Apprehen- 
sions ; and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I know 
not what my Tongue might express : but it was ra- 
ther Exclamation, fuch as, Lord ! what a miferable 
Creature am I ? If I ftiould be fick, I fliall certain- 
ly die for Want of Help, and what will become of 
me ! Then the Tears burft out of my Eyes, and 
I could fay no more for a good while. 

In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father 
came to my Mind, and prefently his Prediction 
which I mention'd at the Beginning of this Story, 
viz. That if I did take thisfoolijh Step, God would not 
blefs me, and I would have Leifure hereafter to refieEl 
upon having negleBedhis Counfel> when there might be 
none to affijl in my Recovery. Now, faid I aloud, 
My dear Father's Words are come to pafs : God's 
Juftice has overtaken me, and I have none to help 
or hear me : I reje&ed the Voice of Providence, 
which had mercifully put me in a Pofture or Sta- 
tion of Life, wherein I might have been happy 
and eafy ; but I would|neither fee it my felf, or learn 
to know the Blefling of it from my Parents ; I left 
them to mourn over my Folly, and now I am left 
to mourn under the Confequences of it ; I refus'd 
their Help and Afliftance who wou'd have lifted me 
into the World, and wou'd have made every Thing 
eafy to me, and now I have Difficulties to ftrug- 
gle with, too great for even Nature itfelf to fup- 
port, and no Afliftance, no Help, no Comfort, no 
Advice ; then I cry'd out, Lord be my Help, for I 
am in great Diftrejs. 

This was the firft Prayer, if I may call it fo, 
that I had made for many Years : But I return 
my Journal, 

June 



[io 7 ] 



June 28. Having been iomewhat refrefh'd with 
the" Sleep I had had, and the Fit being entirely 
off, I got up ; and tho' the Fright and Terror of 
my Dream was very great, yet I confider'd, that 
the Fit of the Ague wou'd return again the next 
Day, and now was my Time to get fomething to 
refrefh and fupport my felf when I lhould be ill ; 
and the firft Thing I did, I fill'd a large fquare 
Cafe Bottle with Water, and fet it upon my Ta- 
ble, in Reach of my Bed ? and to take off the chill 
or aguifti Difpofition of the Water, I put 
about a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, 
and mix'd them together ; then I got me a Piece 
of the Goat's Flefh, and broil'd it on the Coals, but 
could eat very little ; I walk'd about, but was very 
weak, and withal very fad and heavy-hearted in 
the Senfe of my miferable Condition; dread- 
ing the return of my diftemper the next Day ;. 
at Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's 
Eggs, which I roafted in the Allies, and eat, as we 
call it, in the Shell ; and this was the firft Bit of 
Meat I had ever ask'd God's Blefling to, even as 
I cou'd remember, in my whole Life. 

After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found 
my felf fo weak, that I cou'd hardly carry the 
Gun, (for I never went out without that) fo I 
went but a little Way, and fat down upon the 
(Sround, looking out upon the Sea, which was 
juft before me, and very calm and fmooth: As 
I fat here, fome fuch Thoughts as these occurred 
to me. 

What is this Earth and Sea of which I have feero 
fb much, whence is it produc'd, and what am I, 
and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane 
and brutal, whence are we ? 

Sure- 



[io8] 



Sure we are all made by fome fecret Power, who 
form'd the Earth and Sea, rhe Air and Sky ; and 
who is that ? 

Then it follow'd moil naturally, It is God that 
has made it all : Well, but then it came on ftrangely, 
if God has made all thefe Things, He guides and 
governs them all, and all Things that concern 
them ; for the Power that could make all Things, 
muft certainly have Power to guide and direA 
them. 

If fo, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of 
his Works, either without his Knowledge or Ap- 
pointment. 

And if nothing happens without his Knowledge, 
he knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful 
Condition; and if nothing happens without his 
Appointment, he has appointed all this to befal 
me. 

Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict 
any of thefe Conclufions ; and therefore it refted 
upon me with the greater Force, that it muft needs 
be, that God had appointed all this to befal me; that 
I was brought to this miferable Circumftance by 
his Dire&ion, he having the fole Power, not of me 
only, but of every Thing that happen'd in the 
World. Immediately it follow'd, 

Why has God done this to me ? What have I done 
to be thus us'd? 

My Confcience prefently check'd me in that En- 
quiry, as if I had blafphem'd, and methought it 
fpoke to me like a Voice ; WRE TCH! doft thou 
ask what thou haft done I look back upon a dreadful 
mif-fpent Life, and ask thy felf what thou haft not 
done? ask, Why is it that thou wert not long ago de- 
ftrofdl Why wert thou not drown' d in Yarmouth 
Roads ? Kill din the Fight when the Ship was taken by 
the Sallee man of War? Devoured by the wild Beq/is 

on 



[ io 9] 



on the Coaft of Africa? Or, Drown 9 d HERE, 
when all the Crew perijh'd but thy Jelfi Doft thou ask, 
What have I done ? 

I was ftruck dumb with thefe Reflexions, as one 
aftonifh'd, and had not a Word to fay, no not to 
anfwer to my felf, but rife up penfive and fad, 
walk'd back to my Retreat, and went up over my 
Wall, as if I had been going to Bed, but my 
Thoughts were fadly difturb'd, and I had no In- 
clination to Sleep; fo I fat down in my Chair, 
and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark : 
Now as the Apprehenfion of the Return of my Di- 
ftemper terrify 'd me very much, it occurr'd to my 
Thought, that the Brazilians take no Phyfick but 
their Tobacco, for almoft all Diftempers ; and I 
had a Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of the 
Chefts, which was quite cur'd, and some alfo that 
was green and not quite cur'd. 

I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in 
this Cheft 1 found a Cure, both for Soul and Body, 
I open'd the Cheft, and found what I look'd for, viz. 
the Tobacco ; and as the few Books, I had fav'd, 
lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which 
I mention'd before, and which to this Time I had 
not found Leifure, or fo much as Inclination to 
look into ; I fay, I took it out, and brought both 
that and the Tobacco with me to the Table. 

What Ufe to make of the Tobacco, I knew not, 
as to my Diftemper, or whether it was good for it 
or no ; but I try'd feveral Experiments with it, as 
if I was refolv'd it ftiould hit one Way or other : 
I firft took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my 
Mouth, which' indeed at firft almoft ftupify'd my 
Brain, the Tobacco being green and ftrong, and 
that I had not been much us'd to it ; then I took 
fome and fteeped it an Hour or two in fome Rum, 
and refolv'd to take a Dofe of it when I lay down ; 

and 



[ IIQ ] 



and laftly, I burnt fome upon a Pan of Coals, and 
held my Nofe clofe over the Smoke of it as long as 
I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almoft for 
Suffocation. 

In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the 
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too 
much difturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading, 
at leaft that Time ; only having opened the Book ca- 
fually, the firft Words that occurr'd to me were 
thefe, Call on me in the Day of Trouble, aud 1 will deli- 
ver \ and thou jhalt glorify me. 

The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made 
fome Impreffion upon my Thoughts at the Time of 
reading them, tho' not fo much as they did after- 
wards ; for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no 
Sound, as I may Jay, to me; the Thing was fo remote, 
fo impoffible in my Apprehenfion of Things, that 
I began to fay as the Children of lfrael did, when 
they were promis'd Fleih to eat, Can God/pread a 
Table in the Wilderness ; fo I began to fay, Can God 
himfelf deliver me from this Place ? and as it was 
not for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this 
prevaiTd very often upon my Thoughts: But 
however, the Words made a great Impreffion upon 
me, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew 
now late, and the Tobacco had, as I faid, doz'd 
my Head fo much, that I inclin'd to fleep ; fo I 
left my Lamp burning in the Cave, leaft I fhould 
want any Thing in the Night, and went to Bed ; 
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done 
in all my Life, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God 
to fulfil the Promife to me, that if I call'd upon him 
in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me ; af- 
ter my broken and imperfedfc Prayer was over, I 
drunk the Rum in which I had fteep'd the Tobac- 
co, which was fo ftrong and rank of rhe Tabacco, 
that indeed I could fcarce get it down; immediately 

upon 



[Ill] 



upon this I went to Bed, I found prefently it flew 
up in my Head violently, but I fell into a found 
Sleep, and wak'd no more 'till by the Sun it muft 
neceflarily be near Three a-Clock in the Afternoon 
the next Day ; nay, to this Hour, I'm partly of the 
Opinion, that I flept all the next Day and Night, 
and 'till almoft Three that Day after ; for other- 
wife I knew not how I ftiould lofe a Day out of my 
Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appeared 
fome Years after I had done : for if I had loft it by 
croffing and re-croffing the Line, I ftiould have loft 
more than one Day : But certainly I loft a Day in 
my Accompt, and never knew which Way, 

Be ihat however one Way or th' other, when I 
awak'd I found my felf exceedingly refrefti'd, and 
my Spirits lively and chearful ; when I got up, I 
was ftronger than I was the Day before, and my 
Stomach better, for I was hungry ; and in (hort, I 
had no Fit the next Day, but continu'd much 
alter'd for the better; this was the 29th. 

The 30th was my well Day of Courfe, and I 
went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to 
travel too far, I kill'd a Sea Fowl or two, fome- 
thing like a brand Goofe, and brought them Home, 
but was not very forward to eat them ; fo I ate fome 
more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good : 
This Evening I renew'd the Medicine which I had 
fuppos'ddid me good the Day before, viz. the Tobac- 
co fteep'd in Rum, only I did not take fo much as be- 
fore, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold my Head 
over the Smoke ; however, I was not fo well the 
next Day, which was the firft of July, as I hop'd I 
fhou'd have been ; for I had a little Spice of the cold 
Fit, but it was not much. 

July 2. I renew'd the Medicine all the three 
Ways, and doz'd my felf with it as at firft ; and 
doubled the Quantity which I drank. 

3- I 



[ I" ] 



3. I mifs'd the Fit for good and all, tho* I did 
not recover my full Strength for fome Weeks after ; 
while I was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts 
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, / will deliver 
thee, and the Impoffibility of my Deliverance lay 
much upon my Mind in Barr of my ever expefting 
it : But as I was difcouraging my felf with fuch 
Thoughts, it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored 
fo much upon my Deliverance from the main Affii- 
dion, that I difregarded the Deliverance I had re- 
ceiv'd ; and I was, as it were, made to ask my 
felf fuch Queftions as thefe, viz. Have I not been 
deliver'd, and wonderfully too, from Sicknefs ? f 
the moft diftrefs'd Condition that could be, and 
that was fo frightful to me, and what Notice I 
had taken of it : Had I done my Part, God bad de- 
livered me y but I had not glorify *d him ; that is to fay, 
I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a 
Deliverance, and how could I expe<5t greater De- 
liverance ? 

This touch'd my Heart very much, and imme- 
diately I kneeel'd down and gave God Thanks a- 
loud, for my Recovery from my Sicknefs. 

July 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and be- 
ginning at the New Teftament, I began ferioufly 
to read it, and impos'd upon my felf to read a 
while every Morning and every Night, not tying 
my felf to the Number of Chapters, but as long as 
my Thoughts fhou'd engage me : It was not long 
after I fet ferioufly to this Work, but I found 
my Heart more deeply and fincerely afFe&ed with 
the Wickednefs of my paft Life : The Im- 
preffion of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words, All 
thefe Things have not brought thee to Repentance, ran fe- 
rioufly in my Thought : I was earneftly begging. 
of God to give me Repentance, when it happen'd 
providentially the very Day that reading the Scri- 
pture- 



["3] 

ture, I came to thefe Words, He is exalted a Prince 
and a Saviour, to give Repentance^ and to give Remiffi- 
on : I threw down the Book, and with my Heart 
as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a 
Kind of Extafy of Joy, I cry'd out aloud, J ejus, 
thou Son <jf David, Jefus, thou exalted Prince and Sa- 
viour, give me Repentance ! 

This was the firft Time that I could fay, in the 
true Senfe of the Words, that I pray'd in all my Life; 
for now I pray'd with a Senfe of my Condition, 
and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded 
on the Encouragement of the Word of God; and 
from this Time, I may fay, I began to have Hope 
that God would hear me. 

Now I began to conftrue the Words mentioned 
above, Call on me and I will deliver you, in a diffe- 
rent Senfe from what I had ever done before ; for 
then I had no Notion of any thing being call'd De- 
liverance, but my being deliver'd from the Capti- 
vity I was in; for tho* I was indeed at large 
in the Place, yet the Ifland was certainly a 
Prifon to me, and that in the worft Senfe in the 
World; but now I learnd to take it in another 
Senfe : Now I look'd back upon my paft Life with 
fuch Horrour, and my Sins appear'd fo dreadful, 
that my Soul fought nothing of God, but Delive- 
rance from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my 
Comfort : As for my folitary Life it was nothing ; 
I did not fo much as pray to be deliver'd from it, 
or think of it ; It was all of no Consideration in 
Comparifon to this : And I add this Part here, to 
hint to whoever ihall read it, that whenever they 
come to a true Senfe of things, they will find Deli- 
verance from Sin a much greater Blefling, that De- 
liverance from Affli<5lion. 

But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal. 

I My 



[ "4] 



My Condition began now to be, tho' not lefs mi- 
ferable as to my Way of living, yet much eafier 
to my Mind ; and my thoughts being dire&ed, by 
a conftant reading the Scripture, and praying to 
God, to things of a higher Nature : I had a great 
deal of Comfort within, which till now I knew no- 
thing of; alfo, as my Health and Strength returned, 
I beftirr'd my felf to furnifh my felf with every thing 
that I wanted, and make my Way of living as re- 
gular as I could. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly 
employ'd in walking about with my Gun in my 
Hand, a little and a little, at a Time, as a Man 
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of 
Sicknefs ; For it is hardly to be imagin'd, how low 
I was, and to what Weaknefe I was reduc'd. The 
Application which I made Ufe of was perfe&ly 
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague 
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to 
pra&ife, by this Experiment; and tho* it did car- 
ry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken- 
ing me ; for I had frequent Convulsions in my 
Nerves and Limbs for fome Time. 

I learn'd from it alfo this in particular, that be- 
ing abroad in the rainy Seafon was the moft pernici- 
ous thing to my Health that could be, efpecially in 
thofe Rains which came attended with Storms and 
Hurricanes of Wind ; for as the Rain which came 
in the dry Seafon was always moft accompany'd 
with fuch Storms, fo I found that Rain was much 
more dangerous than the Rain which fell in Septem- 
ber and Ofioher. 

I had been now in this unhappy Ifland about 1 o 
Months, all Poffibility of Deliverance from this 
Condition, feem'd to be entirely taken from me ; 
and I firmly believ'd, that no humane Shape had 
ever fet Foot upon that Place. Having now fecur'd 

my 



[»s3 



my Habitation, as I thought, fully to my Mind, I 
.had a great Defire to make a more Perfect Difco- 
very of the Ifland, and to fee what other Produ- 
<5tions I might find, which I yet knew nothing 
of. 

It was the 1 5th of July that I began to take a 
more particular Survey of the Ifland it felf : I went 
up the Creek firft, where, as I hinted, I brought 
my Rafts on Shore ; I found after I came about 
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any 
.higher, and that it was no more than a little 
Brook of running Water, and very frefh and good ; 
but this being the dry Seafon, there was hardly 
any Water in fome Parrs of it, at leaft, not enough 
to run in any Stream, fo as it could be perceiv'd. 

On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea- 
sant Savanas, or Meadows; plain, fmooth, and 
♦cover'd with Grafs; and on the rifing Parts of 
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa- 
ter, as it might be fuppofed, never overflow'd, 
I found a great deal of Tobacco, green, and growing 
to a great and very ftrong Stalk ; there were di- 
vers other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Un- 
«derftanding about, and might perhaps have Ver- 
♦tues of their, own, which I could not find out. 

I fearched for the Caffava Root, which the In- 
dians in all that Climate make their Bread of, but I 
could find none. I faw large Plants of Alloes, but 
did not then underftand them. I faw feveral Sugar 
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, im- 
perfeft. I contented my felf with thefe Difcoveries 
for this Time, and came back mufing with my 
(elf what Courfe I might take to know the Vertue 
and Goodnefs of any of the Fruits or Plants which 
I fhould difcover ; but could bring it to no Con- 
clufion ; for in fhort, I had made fo little Obfer- 
vation while I was in the Brafils, that I knew little 

I 2 of 



[u6] 



of the Plants in the Field, at leaft very little that 
might ferve me to any Purpofe now in my Di- 
ftrefs. 

The next Day, the 16th, I went up the fame 
Way again, and after going fomething farther than 
I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook, and 
the Savanas began to ceafe, and the Country be- 
came more woody than before; in this Part I found 
different Fruits, and particularly I found Mellons 
upon the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes 
upon the Trees ; the Vines had fpread indeed over 
the Trees, and the Clutters of Grapes were juft 
now in their Prime, very ripe and rich : This was a 
furprifing Difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of 
them ; but I was warn'd by my Experience to eat 
fparingly of them, remembring, that when I was 
afhore in Barbary, the eating of Grapes kill 'd feveral 
of our Englifh Men who were Slaves there, by- 
throwing them into Fluxes and Feavers: But I 
found an excellent Ufe for thefe Grapes, and that 
was to cure or dry them in the Sun, and keep 
them as dry'd Grapes or Raifins are kept, which 
I thought would be, as indeed they were, as 
wholefom as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes 
might be to be had. 

I ipent all that Evening there, and went not 
back to my Habitation, which by the Way was 
the firft Night, as I might fay, I had lain from 
Home. In the Night I took my firft Contrivance, 
and got up into a Tree, where I flept well, and the 
next Morning proceeded upon my Difcovery, tra- 
velling near four Miles, as I might judge by the 
Length of the Valley, keeping ftill due North, with 
a Ridge of Hills on the South and North-fide of 
me. 

At the End of this March I came to an Open- 
ing, where the Country feem'd to defcend to the 

Weft, 



[»7] 

Weft, and a litrle Spring of frelh Water which if- 
fued out of the Side of the Hill by me, run the 
other Way, that is due Eaft ; and the Country ap- 
pear'd fo frefh, fo green, fo flouriftiing, every thing 
being in a conftant Verdure, or Flourifh of Springy 
that it looked like a planted Garden. 

I defcended a little on the Side of that delicious 
Vale, furveying it with a fecret Kind of Pleafure, 
(tho* mixt with my other afflifting Thoughts) to 
think that this was all my own, that I was King 
and Lord of all this Country indefeafibly, and had 
a Right of Pofleffion ; and if I could convey it 
I might have it in Inheritance, as compleatly as 
any Lord of a Mannor in England. I faw here 
Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange and Lem- 
mon, and Citron Trees ; but all wild, and very 
few bearing any Fruit, at leaft not then : Howe- 
ver, the green Limes that I gathered, were not 
only pleafant to eat, but very wholefome ; and I 
mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which 
made it very wholefome, and very cool, and re- 
freshing. 

I found now I had Bufinefs enough to gather and 
carry Home; and I refolvM to lay up a Store, as 
well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnifh 
my felf for the wet Seafon, which I knew was ap- 
proaching. 

In Order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of 
Grapes in one Place, and a lefler Heap in another 
Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in 
another Place ; and taking a few of each with me, 
I traveird homeward, and refolv'd to come again, 
and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make to 
carry the reft Home. 

Accordingly, having fpent three Days in this 
Journey, I came Home ; fo I muft now call my 
Tent and my Cave : But, before I got thither, the 

1 3 Grapes 



[n8] 



Grapes were fpoiPd, the Richnefe of the Fruits> 
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them^ 
and bruis'd them, they were good for little or no- 
thing; as to the Limes, they were good, but I 
could bring but a few. 

The next Day, being the 19th, I went back,, 
having made me two fmall Bags to bring Home 
my Harveft : But I was furpriz'd, when coming, 
to my Heap of Grapes, which were fo rich and 
fine when I gather'd them, I found them all 
fpread about, trod to Pieces, and dragg'd about,, 
fome here, fome there, and Abundance eaten and 
devour'd : By this I concluded, there were fome 
wild Creatures thereabouts, which had done this ; 
but what they were, I knew not. 

However, as I found there there was no laying 
them up on Heaps, and no carrying them away in 
a Sack, but that one Way they would be deftroy'd, 
and the other Way they would be crufh'd with 
their own Weight. I took another Courfe ; for I 
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung 
them up upon the out Branches of the Trees* that 
they might cure and dry in the Sun ; and as for 
the Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as many back as 
I could well ftand under. 

When I came Home from this Journey, I con- 
templated with great Pleafure the Fruitfulnefs of 
that Valley, and the Pleafantnefs of the Scituation, 
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water, 
and the Wood, and concluded, that I had pitch'd upon 
a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far the worft 
Part of the Country. Upon the Whole I began 
to confider of removing my Habitation ; and 
to look out for a place equally fafe, as where I now 
was fcituate, if poffible, in that pleafant fruitful 
Part of the Ifland. 

This 



["9] 



This Thought run long' in my Head, and I was 
exceeding fond of it for fome Time, the Pleafant- 
nefs of the Place tempting me ; but when I came 
to a nearer View of it, and to confider that I was 
now by the Sea-Side, where it was at leaft poflible 
that fomething might happen to my Advantage, 
and by the fame ill Fate that brought me hither, 
might bring fome other unhappy Wretches to the 
fame Place ; and tho' it was fcarce probable that 
any fuch Thing fhould ever happen, yet to enclofe 
my felf among the Hills and Woods, in the Center 
of the Ifland, was to anticipate my Bondage, and 
to rend fuch an Affair not only Improbable, but 
Impoffible ; and that therefore I ought riot by any 
Means to remove. 

However, I was fo Enamour 'd of this Place, 
that I fpent much of my Time there, for the 
whole remaining Part of the Month of y uly ; and 
tho' upon fecond Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not 
to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower, 
and furrounded it at a Diftance with a ftrong 
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could 
reach, well ftak'd, and fill'd between with Brujh- 
wood ; and here I lay very fecure, fometimes two 
or three Nights together, always going over it 
with a Ladder, as before; fo that I fancy 'd now 
I had my Country-Houfe, and my Sea-Coaft- 
Houfe : And this Work took me up to the Begin- 
ning of Auguft. 

I had but newly finifti'd my Fence, and be- 
gan to enjoy my Labour, but the Rains came on, 
and made me ftick clofe to my fir ft Habitation ; for 
tho' I had made me a Tent like the other, with a 
Piece of a Sail, and fpread it very well; yet I had 
not the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, 
nor a Cave behind me to retreat into, when the 
Rains were extraordinary. 

1 4 About 



[ I2 °] 



About the Beginning of Auguft, as 1/aid, I had 
finifh'd my Bower, and began to enjoy my felf. 
The third of Auguft> I found the Grapes I had 
hung up were perfectly dry'd, and indeed, were 
excellent good Raifins of the Sun ; fo I began to 
take them down from the Trees, and it was very 
happy that I did fo ; for the Rains which follow'd 
would have fpoil'd them, and I had loft the beft 
Part of my Winter Food ; for I had above two 
hundred large Bunches of them. No (boner had 
I taken them all down, and carry'd moft of them 
Home to my Cave, but it began to rain, and 
from hence, which was the fourteenth of Augujt> 
it rain'd more or lefs, every Day, till the Middle 
of Oftober ; and fometimes fo violently, that I could 
not ftir out of my Cave for feveral Days. 

In this Seafon I was much furpriz'd with the 
Increafe of my Family ; I had been concern'd for 
the Lofs of one of my Cats, who run away from 
me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no 
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Aftonifh- 
ment fhe came Home about the End of Auguji^ 
with three Kittens ; this was the more ftrange to 
me, becaufe tho' I had kilPd a wild Cat, as I 
call'd it, with my Gun; yet I thought it was a 
quite differing Kind from our European Cats ; yet 
the young Cats were the iame Kind of Houfe 
breed like the old one ; and both my Cats being 
Females, I thought it very ftrange : But from thefe 
three Cats, I afterwards came to be so pefter'd 
with Cats, that I was forc'd to kill them like 
Vermine, or wild Beafts, and to drive them from 
my Houfe as much as poflible. 

From the fourteenth of Augufi to the twenty 
fixth, inceflant Rain, fo that I could not ftir, and 
was now very careful not to be much wet. In this 
Confinement I began to be ftraitned for Food, but 

venturing 



[ I21 ] 



venturing out twice, I one Day kill'd a Goat, and 
the laft Day, which was the twenty fixth, found 
a very large Tortoife, which was a Treat to me, 
and my Food was regulated thus ; I eat a Bunch 
of Raifins for my Breakfaft, a Piece of the Goat's 
Flefh, or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil'd ; for 
to my gfeat Misfortune, I had no Veflel to boil or 
ftew any Thing ; and two or three of the Tur- 
tle's Eggs for my Supper. 

Duringthis Confinement in my Cover, by theRain, 
I work'd daily two or three Hours at enlarging my 
Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on towards one Side, 
till I came to the Out-Side of the Hill, and made 
a Door or Way out, which came beyond my Fence 
or Wall, and fo I came in and out this Way ; but I 
was not perfectly eafy at lying fo open ; for as I 
had manag'd my felf before, I was in a perfeft En- 
clofure, whereas now I thought I lay expos'd, and 
open for any Thing to come in upon me ; and yet 
I could not perceive that there was any living 
Thing to fear, the biggeft Creature that I had yet 
feen upon the Ifland being a Goat. 

September the thirtieth, I was now come to the 
unhappy Anniverfary of my Landing, I call up the 
Notches on my Poft, and found I had been on 
Shore three hundred and fixty five Days. I kept 
this Day as a Solemn Faft, fetting it apart to Reli- 
gious Exercife, proftrating my felf on the Ground 
with the moft ferious Humiliation, confeffing my 
Sins to God, acknowledging his Righteous Judg- 
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer- 
cy on me, through Jefus Chrift ; and having not 
tafted the leafl: Refreftiment for twelve Hours, 
even till the going down of the Sun, I then 
eat a Bisket Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and 
went to Bed, finifhing the Day as I began it. 

I had 



[ I22 J 



I had all this Time obferv'd no Sabbath-Day ; 
for as at firft I had no Senfe of Religion upon my 
Mind, I had after fome Time omitted to diftin- 
guifti the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than 
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and fo did not really 
know what any of the Days were ; but now having 
call up the Days, as above, I found I had been 
there a Year ; fo I divided it into Weeks, and fet 
apart every feyenth Day for a Sabbath ; though I 
found at the End of my Account I had loft a Day 
or two in my Reckoning 

A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and 
fo I contented my felf to ufe it more fparingly, and 
to write down only the moft remarkable Events of 
my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum 
of other Things. 

The rainy Seafon, and the dry Seafon, began now 
to appear regular to me, and I learn'd to divide 
them fo, as to provide for them accordingly. But 
I bought all my Experience before I had it, and 
this I am going to relate, was one of the moft dif- 
couraging Experiments that I made at all : I have 
mention'd that I had fav'd the few Ears of Barley 
and Rice, which I had fo furprizingly found fpring 
up, as I thought, of themfelves, and believe there 
was about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twenty 
of Barley ; and now I thought it a proper Time to 
fow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its Southern 
Pofition going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well 
as I could with my wooden Spade, and dividing it 
into two Parts, I fow'd my Grain ; but as I was 
fowing, it cafually occur'd to xny Thoughts, That I 
woidd not fow it all at firft, becaufe I did not know 
when was the proper Time for it ; fo I fow'd about 
two Thirds of the Seed, leaving about a Handful 
of each. 

It 



E I2 3] 



It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that 
I did fo, for not one Grain of that I fow'd this 
Time came to any Thing; for the dry Months 
following, the Earth having had no Rain after 
the Seed was fbwn, it had no Moifture, to affift 
its Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet 
Seafon had come again, and then it grew as if it 
had been but newly fown. 

Finding my firft Seed did not grow, which I 
eafily imagin'd was by the Drought, I fought for 
a moifter Peice of Ground to make another Trial 
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new 
Bower, and fow'd the reft of my Seed in February, 
a little before the Vernal Equinox ; and this ha- 
ving the rainy Months of March and April to wa- 
ter it, fprung up very pleafantly, and yielded a 
very good Crop ; but having Part of the Seed left 
only, and not daring to fow all that I had, I had 
but a {mall Quantity at laft, my whole Crop not 
amounting to above half a Peck of each kind. 

But by this Experiment I was made Mafter of 
my Bufinefs, and knew exa&ly when the proper 
Seafon was to fow ; and that I might expedt two 
Seed Times, and two Harvefts every Year. 

While this Corn was growing, I made a little 
Difcovery which was of ule to me afterwards : As 
foon as the Rains were over, and the Weather be- 
gan to fettle, which was about the Month of No- 
vember, I made a Vifit up the Country to my Bow- 
er, where though I had not been fome Months, yet 
I found all Things juft as I left them. The Cir- 
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on- 
ly firm and entire ; but the Stakes which I had cut 
out of fome Trees that grew thereafoouts, were all 
fhot out and grown with long Branches, as much 
as a Willow-Tree ufually fhoots the firft Year after 
lopping its Head I could not tell what Tree to 

call 



[I2 4 ] 

call it, that thefe Stakes were cut from. I was 
furpriz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to fee the 
young Trees grow ; and I prun'd them, and led them 
up to grow as much alike as I could ; and it is 
fcarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew 
into in three Years ; fo that though the Hedge 
made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Dia- 
meter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might now call 
them, foon cover'd it; and it was a compleat 
Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the dry Seafon. 

This made me refolve to cut fbme more Stakes, 
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle 
round my Wall ; I mean that of my firft Dwelling, 
which I did ; and placing the Trees or Stakes in a 
double Row, at about eight Yards diftance from 
my firft Fence, they grew prefently, and were at 
firft a fine Cover to my Habitation, and afterward 
ferv'd for a Defence alfo, as I fhall obferve in 
its Order. 

I found now, That the Seafons of the Year 
might generally be divided, not into Summer and 
Winter^ as in Europe ; but into the Rainy Seafons, 
and the Dry Seafons, which were generally thus,

The Rainy Seafon fometimes held longer or 
fhorter, as the Winds happen'd to blow ; but this 
was the general Obfervation I made : After I had 
found by Experience, the ill Confequence of being 
abroad in the Rain, I took Care to furnifh my 
felf with Provifions before hand, that I might not 
be oblig'd to go out ; and I fat within Doors as 
much as poflible during the wet Months. 

This Time I found much Employment, (and 
very fuitable alfo to the Time) for I found great 
Occafion of many Things which I had no way to 
furnifh my felf with, but by hard Labour and con- 
ftant Application ; particularly, I try'd many Ways 
to make my felf a Basket, but all the Twigs I 
could get for the Purpofe prov'd fo brittle, that 
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent Ad- 
vantage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I 
ufed to take great Delight in ftanding at a Basket- 
makers, in the Town where my Father liv'd, to 
fee them make their Wicker-ware; and being as 
Boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a 
great Obferver of the Manner how they work'd 
thofe Things, and fometimes lending a Hand, I 
had by this Means full Knowledge of the Methods 
of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials ; 
when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of 
that Tree from whence I cut my Stakes that grew, 

might 



[ia6] 



might poflibly be as tough as the Sallows, and 
Willows, and OJiers in England, and I refblv'd 
to try. 

Accordingly the next Day, I went to my Coun- 
try- Houfe, as I call'd it, and cutting fome of the 
fmaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpofe as 
much as I could defire ; whereupon I came the next 
Time prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a 
Quantity, which I foon found, for there was great 
Plenty of them; thefe I fet up to dry 'within my 
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe. 
I carry'd them to my Cave, and here during the 
next Seafon, I employ 'd my felf in making, as well 
as I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry 
Earth, or to carry or lay up any Thing as I had 
occafion ; and tho' I did not finifli them very hand- 
fomly, yet I made them fufficiently ferviceable for 
my Purpofe ; and thus afterwards I took Care ne- 
ver to be without them ; and as my Wicker-ware 
decay *d, I made more, efpecially, I made ftrong 
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, inftead of Sacks, 
when I fhould come to have any Quantity of it. 

Having mafter'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a 
World of Time about it, I beftirr'd my felf to fee 
if poflible how to fupply two Wants : I had no 
Veflels to hold any Thing that was Liquid, ex- 
cept two Runlets which were almoft full of Rum, 
and fome Glafs-Bottles, fome of the common Size, 
and others which were Cafe-Botdes-Square, for 
the holding of Waters, Spirits, fcfr. I had' not fo 
much as a Pot to boil any Thing, except a great 
Kettle, which I fav'd out of the Ship, and which 
was too big for fuch Ufe as I defired it, viz. To 
make Broth, and ftew a Bit of Meat by it felf. 
The Second Thing I would fain have had, was a 
Tobacco-Pipe ; but it was impoflible to me to 

make 



L I2 7] 



make one, however, I found a Contrivance for that 
too at laft. 

I employ 'd my felf in Planting my Second Rows 
of Stakes or Piles and in this Wicker working all the 
Summer, or dry Seafon, when another Bufinefs 
took me up more Time than it could be imagin'd 
I could fpare. 

I mention'd before, That I had a great Mind to 
fee the whole Ifland, and that I had travelled up 
the Brook, and fo on to where I built my Bower, 
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on 
the other Side of the Ifland; I now refblv'd to 
travel quite Crofs to the Sea-Shore on that Side ; 
fo, taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog, and 
a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than ufual, 
with two Bisket Cakes, and a great Bunch of 
Raifins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my 
Journey; when I had pafs'd the Vale where my 
Bower flood as above, I came within View of the 
Sea, to the Weft, and it being a very clear Day, I fairly 
defcry'd Land, whether an Ifland or a Continent, I 
could not tell ; but it lay very high, extending from 
the Weft, to the W. S. W. at a very great Diftance ; 
by my Guefs it could not be lefs than Fifteen or 
Twenty Leagues of. 

I could not tell what Part of the World this 
might be, otherwife than that I know it muft be 
Part of America, and as I concluded by all my 
Obfervations, muft be near the Spanijh Dominions, 
and perhaps was all Inhabited by Savages, where 
if I fhould have landed, I had been in a worfe 
Condition than I was now ; and therefore I acqui- 
efced in the Difpofitions of Providence, which I be- 
gan now to own, and to believe, order'd every 
Thing for the beft; I fay, I quieted my Mind 
with this, and left affli&ing my felf with Fruitlefs 
Wifhes of being there. 

Befides 



[128] 



Befides, after fome Paufe upon this Affair, I 
confider'd, that if this Land was the Spanijh Coaft, 
I ftiould certainly, one Time or other, fee fome 
Veflel pafs or repafs one Way or other; but 
if not, then it was the Savage Coaft between the 
Spanijh Country and Brajih, which are indeed the 
worft of Savages ; for they are Cannibals, or Men- 
eaters, and fail not to murther and devour all the 
humane Bodies that fall into their Hands. 

With thefe Considerations I walk'd very leifure- 
ly forward, I found that Side of the Ifland where 
I now was, much pleafanter than mine, the open 
or Savanna Fields fweet, adorn'd with Flowers and 
Grafs, and full of very fine Woods. I faw Abun- 
dance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught one, 
if poffible to have kept it to be tame, and taught 
it to fpeak to me. I did, after fome Pains taking* 
catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd it down with 
a Stick, and having recover'd it, I brought it home ; 
but it was fome Years before I could make him 
fpeak : However, at laft I taught him to call me 
by my Name very familiarly : But the Acci- 
dent that follow'd, tho* it be a Trifle, will be verjr 
diverting in its Place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey : I 
found in the low Grounds Hares, as I thought 
them to be, and Foxes, but they differ'd greatly 
from all the other Kinds I had met with ; nor could 
I fatisfy my felf to eat them, tho' I kill'd feveral r 
But I had no Need to be ventrous ; for I had no* 
Want of Food, and of that which was very good 
too ; especially thefe three Sorts, viz. Goats, Pid- 
geons, and Turtle or Tortoife ; which, added to my 
Grapes, Leaden-hall Market could not have fur— 
nifh'd a Table better than I, in Proportion to the 
Company ; and tho' my Cafe was deplorable e- 
nough, yet I had great Caufe for Thankfulnefs,. 

and 



C I2 9 ] 



that I was not driven to any Extremities for Food ; 
but rather Plenty, even to Dainties. 

I never travelTd in this Journey above two Miles 
outright in a Day, or thereabouts ; but I took fo 
many Turns and Returns, to fee what difcoveries I 
could make, that I came weary enough to the Place 
where I refolv'd to fit down for all Night ; and 
then I either repos'd my felf in a Tree, or fur- 
rounded my felf with a Row of Stakes fet upright 
in the Ground, either from one Tree to another 
or fo as no wild Creature could come at me, with- 
out waking me. 

As foon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was fur- 
priz'd to fee that I had taken up my Lot on the 
worft Side of the Ifland ; for here indeed the Shore 
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas on 
the other Side I had found but three in a Year and 
half. Here was alfo an Infinite Number of Fowls > 
of many Kinds, fome which I had feen, and fome 
which I had not feen of before, and many of them 
very good Meat ; but fuch as I knew not the 
Names of, except thofe call'd Penguins. 

I could have /hot as many as I pleas'd, but was 
very fparing of my Powder and Shot ; and therefore 
had more Mind to kill a ftie Goat, if I could, 
which I could better feed on; and though there 
were many Goats here more than on my Side the 
Ifland, yet it was with much more Difficulty that 
I could come near them, the Country being flat 
and even, and they faw me much fooner than when 
I was on the Hill. 

I confefs this Side of the Country was much 
pleafanter than mine, but yet I had not the leaft 
Inclination to remove ; for as I was fix'd in my Ha- 
bitation, it became natural to me, and I feem'd all 
the while I was here, to be as it were upon a Jour- 
ney, and from Home : However, I travell'd along 

K the 



[ »3o ] 



•the Shore of the Sea, towards the Eajl> I fuppofe 
about twelve Miles ; and then fetting up a great 
Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I 
would go Home again ; and that the next Journey 
I took fhould be on the other Side of the Ifland, 
Eaft from my Dwelling, and fo round till I came 
to my Poft again : Of which in its Place. 

I took another Way to come back than that I 
went, thinking I could eafily keep all the Ifland fo 
much in my View, that I could not mifs finding 
my firft- Dwelling by viewing the Country ; but I 
found my felf miftaken ; for being come about two 
or three Miles, I found my felf defcended into a 
very large Valley; but fb furrounded with 
Hills, and thofe Hills cover'd with Wood, that I 
could not fee which was my Way by any Dire&ion 
but that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefs I knew 
very well the Pofition of the Sun at that Time of 
the Day. 

It happen'd to my farther Misfortune, That the 
Weather prov'd hazey for three or four Days, 
while I was in this Valley ; and not being able to 
fee the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably, 
and at laft was oblig'd to find out the Sea Side, 
look for my Poft, and come back the fame Way I 
went; and then by eafy JourniesI turn'd Homeward, 
the Weather being exceeding hot, and my Gun, Am- 
munition, Hatchet, and other Things very heavy. 

In this Journey my Dog furpriz'd a young Kid, 
and feiz'd upon it, and I running in to take hold 
of it, caught it, and fav'd it alive from the Dog ; 
I had a great Mind to bring it Home if I could ; 
for I had often been mufing, Whether it might not 
be poflible to get a Kid or two, and fo raife a 
Breed of tame Goats, which might fupply me when 
my Powder and Shot fhould be all fpent. 



[>3i ] 

I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with 
a String which I made of fome Rope- Yarn, which 
I always carry 'd about me, I led him along, tho' 
with fome Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, 
and there I enclos'd him, and left him ; for I was 
very impatient to be at Home, from whence I had 
been abfent above a Month. 

I cannot exprefs what a Satisfaftiou it was to 
me, to come into my old Hutch, and lye down in 
my Hamock-Bed : This little wandring Journey, 
without fettled Pla.ce of Abode, had been lb un- 
pleafant to me, that my own Houfe, as I calPd it 
to my felf, was a perfeft Settlement to me, com- 
par'd to that ; and it rendred every Thing about 
me fo comfortable, that I refolv'd I would never 
go a great Way from it again, while it fhould be 
my Lot to ftay on the Ifland. 

Irepos'd my felf here a Week, to reft and regale my 
felf after my long Journey ; during which, moft of 
the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of 
making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be 
a meer Domeftick, and to be mighty well acquain- 
ted with me. Then I began to think of the poor 
Kid, which I had penn'd in within my little Cir- 
cle, and refolv'd to go and fetch it Home, or give 
it fome Food ; accordingly I went, and found it 
where I left it ; for indeed it could not get out, 
but almoft ftarv'd for want of Food : I went and 
cut Bows of Trees, and Branches of fuch Shrubs 
as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed 
it, I ty'd it as I did before, to lead it away ; but 
it was fo tame with being hungry, that I had 
no need to have ty'd it ; for it follow'd me like a 
Dog ; and as I continually fed it, the Creature be- 
came fo loving, fo gentle, and fo fond, that it be- 
came from that Time one of my Domefticks alfo, 
and would never leave me afterwards. 

K 2 The 



[ I 3 2 <] 



The rainy Seafon of the Autumnal Equinox was 
nowcome, and I kept the 30th. of Sept. inthefamefo- 
lemn Manner as before, being the Anniverfary of my 
Landing on the Ifland, having now been there two 
Years, and no more Profped: of being deliver , d > 
than the firft Day I came there. I fpent the whole 
Day in humble and thankful Acknowledgments of 
the many wonderful Mercies which my Solitary 
Condition was attended with, and without which 
it might have been infinitely more miferable. I 
gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had 
been pleas'd to difcover to me, even that it was 
poflible I might be more happy in this Solitary 
Condition, than I fhould have been in a Liberty of 
Society, and in all the Pleafures of the World. That 
he could fully make up to me, the Deficiencies of 
my Solitary State, and the want of Humane So- 
ciety by his Prefence, and the Communications of 
his Grace to my Soul, fupporting, comforting, and 
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence here, 
and hope for his Eternal Prefence hereafter. 

It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how 
much more happy this Life I now led was, with 
all its miferable Circumftances, than the wicked > 
curfed, abominable Life I led all the paft Part 
of my Days ; and now I chang'd both my Sorrows 
and my Joys ; my very. Defires alter'd, my Affe&i- 
ons changed their Gufts, and my Delights were 
perfectly new, from what they were at my firft Co- 
ming, or indeed for the two Years paft. 

Before, as I walk'd about, either on my Hunt- 
ing, or for viewing the Country ; the Anguifti of 
my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon 
me on a fudden, and my very Heart would die 
within me, to think of the Woods, the Mountains, 
the Defarts I was in ; and how I was a Prifoner, 
lock'd up with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of the 

Ocean, 



[ *33 ] 



Ocean, in an uninhabited Wildernefs, without Re- 
demption : In the midft of the greateft Compofures 
of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a 
Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep 
like a Child : Sometimes it would take me in the 
middle of my Work, and I would immediately fit 
down and figh, and look upon the Ground for an 
Hour or two together ; and this was (till worfe to 
me ; for if I could burft out into Tears, or vent 
my felf by Words, it would go off, and the Grief 
having exhaufted it felf would abate. 

But now I began to exercife my felf with new 
Thoughts ; I daily read the Word of God, and ap- 
ply'd all the Comforts of it to my prefent State : 
One Morning being vety fad, I open'd the Bible 
upon thefe Words, I will never, never leave thee, nor 
forfake thee; immediately it occurr'd, That thefe 
Words were to me, Why elfe fhould they i>e direft- 
ed in fuch a Manner, juft at the Moment when I 
was mourning over my Condition, as one forfaken 
of God and Man ? Well then, faid I, if God does 
not forfake me, of what ill Confequence can it be, 
or what matters it, though the World fhould all . 
forfake me, feeing on the other Hand, if I had all 
the World, and fhould lofe the Favour and Blef- 
fing of God, there wou'd be no Comparifon in 
the Lofs. 

From this Moment I began to conclude in my 
Mind, That it was poflible for me to be more 
happy in this forfaken Solitary Condition, than it 
was probable I fhould ever have been in any other 
Particular State in the World; and with this 
Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for 
bringing me to this Place. 

I know not what it was, but fomething fhock'd 
my Mind at that Thought, and I durft not fpeak 
thp Words : How canft thou be fueh a Hypocrite, 

K 3 (faid 



[ J 34] 



(faid I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for 
a Condition, which however thou may'ft endea- 
vour to be contented with, thou would'ft rather 
pray heartily to be deliver'd from ; fo I ftopp'd 
there : But though I could not fay, I thank'd God 
for being there ; yet I fincerely gave Thanks to 
God for opening my Eyes, by whatever afflicting 
Providences, to fee the former Condition of my 
Life, and to mourn for my Wickednefs, and re- 
pent. I never open'd the Bible, or fhut it, but my 
very Soul within me, blefs'd God for directing my 
Friend in England, without any Order of mine, to 
pack it up among my Goods ; and for aflifting me 
afterwards 'to fave it out of the Wreck of the Ship. 
Thus,* and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began 
my third Year ; and tho' I have not given the Rea- 
der the Trouble of fo particular Account of my 
Works this Year as the firft ; yet in General it 
may be obferv'd, That I was very feldom idle ; 
but having regularly divided my Time, according 
to the feveral daily Employments that were before 
me, fuch as, Firft, My Duty to God, and the Read- 
ing the Scriptures, which I conftantly fet apart 
fome Time for thrice every Day. Secondly, The going 
Abroad with my Gun for Food, which generally 
took me up three Hours in every Morning, when 
it did not Rain. 'Thirdly, The ordering, curing* 
preferving, and cooking what I had kill'd or catch'd 
for my Supply ; thefe took up great Part of the 
Day ; alfo it is to be confidered that the middle of the 
Day when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Violence 
of the Heat was too great to ftir out ; fo that a- 
bout four Hours in the Evening was all the Time 
I could be fuppos'd to work in ; with this Excep- 
tion, That fometimes I chang'd my Hours of 
Hunting and Working, and went to work in the 

Morning, 



[135] 



Morning, and Abroad with my Gun in the Af- 
ternoon. 

To this fhort Time allow'd for Labour, I defire 
may be added the exceeding Laborioufnefc of my 
Work; the many Hours which for want of 
Tools, want of Help, and want of Skill; every 
Thing I did, took up out of my Time: For 
Example, I was full two and forty Days making 
me a Board for a long Shelf, which I wanted in 
my Cave ; whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, 
and a Saw- Pit, would have cut fix of them out of 
the fame Tree in half a Day. 

My Cafe was this, It was to be a large Tree, 
which was to be cut down, becaufe my Board was 
to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days 
a cutting down, and two more cutting off the 
Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece of Tim- 
ber. With inexpreflible hacking and hewing I 
reduc'd both the Sides of it into Chips, till it be- 
gun to be light enough to move ; than I turn'd it, 
and made one Side of it fmooth, and fiat, as a 
Board from End to End ; then turning that Side 
downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the 
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth 
on both Sides. Any one may judge the Labour of 
my Hands in fuch a Piece of Work; but Labour 
and Patience carry 'd me through that and many 
other Things: I only obferve this fra Particular, 
to fhew, The Reafon why fo much ofimy Time 
went away with fo little Work, viz. *That what 
might be a little to be done with Help and Tools, 
was a vast Labour, and requir'd a prodigious Time 
to do alone, and by hand. 

But notwithftanding this, with Patience jknd 
Labour I went through many Things ; ^nd indeed 
every Thing that my Circumftances made necefla- 
ry to me to do, as will appear by what follows. 

K 4 I Wks 



[i3<S] 



I was now, in the Months of November and 'De- 
cember^ expe&ing my Crop of Barley and Rice. 
The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them 
was not great; for as- 1 obferv'd, my Seed of each 
was not above the Quantity of half a Peck; 
for I had loft one whole Crop by fowing in the 
dry Seafon ; but now my Crop promis'd very well, 
when on a fudden I found I was in Danger of lo- 
fing it all again by Enemies of feveral Sorts, which 
it was fcarce poflible to keep from it; as Firft, The 
Goats, and wild Creatures which I calTd Hares, 
who tailing the Sweetnefs of the Blade, lay in it 
Night and Day, as foon as it came up, and eat it 
fb clofe, that it could get no Time to {hoot up in- 
to Stalk. 

This I faw no Remedy for, but by making an 
Enclofure about it with a Hedge, which I did 
with a great deal of Toil ; and the more, becaufe 
it requir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land 
was but fmall, fuited to my Crop, I got it totally 
well fenc'd, in about three Weeks Time; and 
fhooting fome of the Creatures in the Day Time, 
I fet my Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him 
up to a Stake at the Gate, where he would ftand 
and bark all Night long ; fb in a little Time the 
Enemies forfook the Place, and the Corn grew ve- 
ry ftrong, and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the Beafts ruined me before, while my 
Corn was in the Blade; fo the Birds were as likely 
to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear ; for go- 
ing along by the Place to fee how it throve, I faw 
my little Crop furrounded with Fowls of I know 
not how many forts, who flood as it were watch- 
ing till 1 fhould be gone : I immediately let fly a- 
mong them (for I always had my Gun with me) 
I had no fooner fhot but there rofe up a a little 

Could 



[ I 37l 



Cloud of Fowls, which I had not feen at all, from 
among the Corn it felf. 

This touch'd me fenfibly, for I forefaw, that in 
a few Days they would devour all my Hopes, that I 
(hould be ftarv'd, and never be able to raife a Crop 
at all, and what to do I could not tell : However 
I refolv'd not to loofe my Corn, if poflible, tho' I 
fliould watch it Night and Day. In the firft 
Place, I went among it to fee what Damage was 
already done, and found they had fpoil'd a good 
deal of it, but that as it was yet too Green for 
them, the Lofs was not fo great, but that the Re- 
mainder was like to be a good Crop if it could 
be fav'd. 

I ftaid by it to load my Gun, and then coming 
away I could eafily fee the Thieves fitting upon all 
the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I 
was gone away, and the Event proved it to be Co ; 
for as I walk'd off as if I was gone, I was no 
fooner out of their fight, but the/ dropt down one 
by one into the Corn again. I was fo provok'd 
that I could not have Patience to ftay till more 
came on, knowing that every Grain that they eat 
now, was, as it might be /aid, a Peck-loaf to me 
in the Confequence ; but coming up to the Hedge, 
I fir'd again, and kill'd three of them. This was 
what I wifh'd for ; fo I took them up, and ferv'd 
them, as we ferve notorious Thieves in England, 
(viz.) Hang'd them in Chains for a Terror to o- 
thers ; it is impoflible to imagine almoft, that this 
fhould have fuch an Effedt, as it had; for the 
Fowls wou'd not only not come at the Corn, but in 
fhort they forfook all that Part of the Ifland, and I 
could never fee a Bird near the Place as long as 
my Scare-Crows hung there, 

* "" This 



[i38] 



This I was very glad of, you maybe fure, and a- 
bout the latter end of December ', which was our fe- 
cond Harveft of the Year, I reap'd my Crop. 

I was fadly put to it for a Scythe or a Side to 
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as 
well as I could out of one of the Broad Swords 
or Cutlaflcs, which I fav'd among the Arms out of 
the Ship. However, as myfirft Crop was but fmall 
I had no great Difficulty to cut it down ; in fhort„ 
I reap'd it my Way, for I cut nothing off but the 
Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which 
I had made, and fo rubb'd it out with my Hands; 
and at the end of all my Harvefting, I found that out 
of my half Peck of Seed, I had near two Bufhels 
of Rice, and above two Bufhels and half of Bar- 
ley, that is to fay, by my Guefs, for I had no Mea- 
fure at that time. 

However, this was a great Encouragement to 
me, and I forefaw that in time, it wou'd pleafe 
God to fupply me with Bread : And yet here I was 
perplex'd again, for I neither knew how to grind or 
make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean 
it and part it; nor if made into* Meal, how to 
make Bread of it, and if how to make it, yet I 
knew not how to bake it ; thefe things being added 
to my Defire of having a good Quantity for Store, 
and to fecure a conftant Supply, I refolv'd not to 
tafte any of this Crop but to preferve it all for 
Seed againft the next Seafon, and in the mean 
time to employ all my Study and Hours of Work- 
ing to accomplifh this great Work of Providing 
my felf with Corn and Bread. 

It might be truly faid, that now I work'd for 
my Bread ; 'tis a little wonderful, and what I be- 
lieve few People have thought much upon, (viz.) the 
ftrange multitude of little Things neceflary in the 

Pro- 



[ 139] 



Providing, Producing, Curing, Dreffing, Making 
and Finishing this one Article of Bread. 

I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature,, 
found this to my daily Difcouragement, and was 
made more and more fenfible of it every Hour, 
even after I had got the firft Handful of Seed- 
Corn, which, as I have faid, came up unexpected- 
ly, and indeed to a furpri2e. 

Firft, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no 
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquer'd, 
by making a wooden Spade, as I obferv'd before ; 
but this did my Work in but a wooden manner, 
and tho' it coft me a great many Days to make 
it, yet for want of Iron it not only wore out the 
fooner, but ijiade my Work the harder,, and made 
it be perform'd much worfe. 

However this I bore with, and was content to 
work it out with Patience, and bear with the bad- 
nefs of the Performance. When the corn was 
fow'd, I had no Harrow, but was forced to go o- 
ver it my felf and drag a great heavy Bough of a 
Tree over it, to Scratch it, as it may be call'd, 
rather than Rake or Harrow it. 

When it was growing and grown, I have ob- 
ferv'd already, how many things I wanted, to 
Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure and 
Carry it Home, Thrafh, Part it from the Chaff, 
and Save it. Then I wanted a Mill to Grind it, 
Sieves to Drefs it, Yeaft and Salt to make it into 
Bread, and an Oven to bake it, and yet all thefe 
things I did without, as fhall be obferv'd ; and 
yet the Corn was an ineftimable Comfort and Ad- 
vantage to me too. All this, as I faid, made 
every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that 
there was no help for ; neither was my time fo 
much Lofs to me, becaufe as I had divided it, a 
certain Part of it was every Day appointed to 

thefe 



[ H°] 

thcfe Works ; and as I refolv'd to ufe none of the 
Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by 
me, I had the next fix Months to apply my felf 
wholly by Labour and Invention to furnifh my 
felf with Utenfils proper for the performing all the 
Operations neceflary for the making the Corn 
(when I had it) fit for my ufe. 

But firft, I was to prepare more Land, for I 
had now Seed enough to fow above an Acre of 
Ground Before I did this, I had a Weeks-work 
at leaft to make me a Spade, which when it was 
done was but a ferry one indeed, and very heavy, 
and reqtiir'd double Labour to work with it; 
however I went thro' that, and fow'd my Seed in 
two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my 
Houfe as I could find them to my Mind, and 
fenc'd them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes 
of which were all cut of that Wood which I had 
fet before, and knew it would grow, fo that iii 
one Year's time I knew I fhould have a Quick or 
Living-Hedge, that would want but little Repair. 
This Work was not fo little as to take me up lefs 
than three Months, becaufe great Part of that 
time was of the wet Seafon, when I could not go 
abroad. 

Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I 
could not go out, I found Employment on the fol- 
lowing Occafions ; always obferving, that all the 
while I was at work I diverted my felf with talk- 
ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to Speak, 
and I quickly learn'd him to know his own Name, 
and at laft to fpeak it out pretty loud POLL, 
which was the firft Word I ever heard fpoken in 
the Ifland by any Mouth but my own. This 
therefore was not my Work, but an affiftant to my 
Work, for now, as I faid, I had a great Employ- 
ment upon my Hands, as follows, (viz.) I had 

long 



[Hi] 



long ftudy'd by fome Means or other, to make 
my felf fome Earthen Veflels, which indeed I 
wanted forely, but knew not where to come at 
them : However, considering the Heat of the Cli- 
mate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any 
fuch Clay, I might botch up fome fuch Pot, as 
might, being dry'd in the Sun, be hard enough,, 
and ftrong enough to bear handling, and to hold 
any Thing that was dry, and requir'd to be kept 
fo; and as this was neceffary in the preparing 
Corn, Meal, &c. which was the Thing I was up- 
on, I refolv'd to make fome as large as I could* 
and fit only to ftand like Jarrs to hold what fhould 
be put into them. 

It would make the Reader pity me, or rather 
laugh at me, to tell how many awkward ways I 
took to raife this Pafte, what odd mifhapen ugly 
things I made, how many of them fell in, and how 
many fell out, the Clay not being ftiff enough to 
bear its own Weight ; how many crack'd by the 
over violent Heat of the Sun, being fet out too 
haftily; and how many fell in pieces with only re- 
moving, as well before as after they were dry'd ;, 
and in a word, how after having labour'd hard to 
find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it 
home and work it; I could not make above two 
large earthern ugly things, I cannot call them Jarrs, 
in about two Months Labour. 

However, as the Sun bak'd thefe Two, very dry 
and hard, I lifted them very gently up, and 
fet them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets, 
which I had made on purpofe for them, that they 
might not break, and as between the Pot and the 
Basket there was a little room to fpare, I ftufPd it 
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and thefe two 
Pots being to ftand always dry, I thought would 

hold 



[ 14*] 



hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal, when 
the Corn was bruifed. 

Tho* I mifcarried fo much in my Defign for 
large Pots, yet I made feveral fmaller things with 
better Supcefs, fuch as little round Pots, flat 
Difhes, Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my 
Hand turn'd to, and the Heat of the Sun bak'd 
them ftrangely hard. 

But all this would not anfwer my End, which 
was to get an earthern Pot to hold what was Li- 
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of thefe could 
do. It happen'd after fome time, making a pretty 
large Fire for cooking my Meat, when I went to 
put it out after I had done with it, I found a bro- 
ken Piece of one of my Earthern- ware Veflels in the 
Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile. I 
was agreeably fuppris'd to fee it, and faid to my 
felf, that certainly they might be made to burn 
whole if they would burn broken. 

This fet me to ftudying how to order my 
Fire, fo as to make it burn me fome Pots. I 
had no Notion of a Kiln, fuch as the Potters burn 
in, or of glazing them with Lead, tho' I had fome 
Lead to do it with ; but I plac'd three large Pip- 
kins, and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon a- 
nother, and plac'd my Fire-wood all round it with 
a great Heap of Embers under them, I ply'd the 
Fire with frefli Fuel round the out-fide, and upon 
the top, till I faw the Pots in the infide red hot 
quite thro', and obferv'd that they did not crack 
at all ; when I faw them clear red, I let them Hand 
in that Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one 
of them, tho' it did not crack, did melt or run, for 
the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted 
by the violence of the Heat, and would have run 
into Glafs if I had gone on, fo I flack'd my Fire 
gradually till the Pots began to abate of the red 

Co- 



[ H3 ] 



Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might 
not let the Fire abate too faft, in the Morning I 
had three very good, I will not fay handfome Pip- 
kins ; and too other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt 
as cou'd be defir'd; and one of them perfectly 
glaz'd with the Running of the Sand. 

After this Experiment, I need not fay that I 
wanted no fort of Earthern Ware for my Ufe ; but 
I muft needs fay, as to the Shapes of them, they 
were very indifferent, as any one may fuppofe, 
when I had no way of making them ; but as the 
Children make Dirt-Pies, or as a Woman would 
make Pies, that never learn'd to raife Paft. 

No Joy at a Thing of fo mean a Nature was e- 
ver equal to mine, when I found I had made an 
Earthern Pot that would bear the Fire ; and I had 
hardly Patience to ftay till they were cold, before 
I {ct qne upon the Fire again, with fome Water in 
it, to boil me fome Meat, which it did admirably 
well ; and with a Piece of a Kid, I made fome 
very good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and 
dfevend other Ingredients, requifite to make it fo 
good as I. would have had it been.. 

My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor- 
tar, to ftamp or beat fome Corn in ; for as to the 
Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Per- 
fection of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To fupply 
this Want I was at a great Lofs ; for of all Trades 
in the World I was as perfectly unqualify'd for a 
Stone-cutter, as for any whatever ; neither had I 
any Tools to go about it with. I fpent many a 
Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut 
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could find 
none at all; except what was in the folid Rock, 
and which I had no way to dig or cut out ; nor in- 
deed were the Rocks in the Ifland of Hardnefs fuf- 
£cient, but were all of a fandy crumbling Stone, 

which 



[ '44] 



which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy 
Peftle, or would break the Corn without filling it 
with Sand ; fo after a great deal of Time loft in 
fearching for a Stone, I gave it over, and refblv'd 
to look out for a great Block of hard Wood, which 
I found indeed much eafier ; and getting one as big 
as I had Strength to ftir, I rounded it, and form'd 
it in the Out-fide with my Axe. and Hatchet, and 
then with the Help of Fire, and infinite Labour,. 
made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in Braftl 
make their Canoes. After this, I made a great hea- 
vy Peftle or Beater, of the Wood calPd the Iron- 
wood, and this I prepar'd and laid by againft I had 
my next Crop of Corn, when I propos'd to my fel£ 
to grind, or rather pound my Corn into Meal to 
make my Bread. 

My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or 
Search, to drefs my Meal, and to part it from the 
Bran, and the Husk, without which I did not fee 
it poflible I could have any Bread. This was a 
moft difficult Thing, fo much as but to think on ; 
for to be fure I had nothing, like the neceflary 
Thing to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas, or 
Stuff, to fearch the Meal through. And here I 
was at a full Stop for many Months ; nor did I real- 
ly know what to do ; Linnen I had none left, but 
what was meer Rags ; I had Goats Hair, but nei- 
ther knew I how to weave it, or (pin it; and had I 
known how, here was no Tools to work it with ; 
all the Remedy that I found for this, was, That at 
laft I did remember I had among the Seamens 
Cloaths which were fav'd out of the Ship, fome 
Neckcloths of Callicoe, or Muflin; and with fome 
Pieces of thefe, I made three fmall Sieves, but 
proper enough for the Work; and thus I made 
fhift for fome Years ; how I did afterwards, I fhall 
fhow in its Place. 

The 



[i4S] 



The baking Part was the next Thing to be con- 
fider'd, and how I fhould make Bread when I came 
to have Corn ; for firft I had no Yeaft ; as to that 
Part, as there was no fupplying the Want, fo I 
did not concern my felf much about it ; But for an 
Oven, I was indeed in great Pain , at length I 
found out an Experiment for that alfb, which was 
this ; I made fome Earthern Veflels very broad, but 
not deep ; th'at is to fay, about two Foot Diame- 
ter, and not above nine Inches deep ; thefe I burnt 
in the Fire, as I had done the other, and laid them 
by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great 
Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav'd with 
fome fquare Tiles of my own making, and burning 
alfo ; but I fhould not call them fquare. 

When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much in- 
to Embers, or live Coals, I drew them forward 
upon this Hearth, fo as to cover it all over, and 
there I let them lye, till the Hearth was very hot, 
then fweeping away all the Embers, I fet down my 
Loaf, or Loaves, and whelming down the Earthen 
Pot upon them, drew the Embers all round the 
Out-fide of the Pot, to keep in, and add to the 
Heat ; and thus, as well as in the beft Oven in the 
World, I bak'd my Barley Loaves, and became in 
little Time a meer Paftry-Cook into the Bargain ; 
for I made my felf feveral Cakes of the Rice, and 
Puddings ; indeed I made no Pies, neither had I 
any Thing to put into them, fuppofing I had, ex- 
cept the Flefh either of Fowls or Goats. 

It need not be wondred at, if all thefe Things 
took me up moft Part of the third Year of my A- 
bode here; for it is to be obferv'd, That in the In- 
tervals of thefe Things, I had my new Harveft and 
Husbandry to manage ; for I reap'd my Corn in its 
Seaibn, and carry'd it Home as well as I could, and 
laid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till I had 

L Time 



[i 4 6] 

Time to rub it out ; for I had no Floor to thrafh it 
on, or Inftrument to thrafti it with. 

And now indeed my Stock of Corn increafing, I 
really wanted to build my Barns bigger. I wanted 
a Place to lay it up in ; for the Increafe of the Corn 
now yielded me fo much, that I had of the 
Barley about twenty Buftiels, and of the Rice as 
much, or more ; infomuch, that now I refolv'd to 
begin to ufe it freely ; for my Bread had been quite 
gone a great while; Alfo I refolv'd to fee what 
Quantity would be fufficient for me a whole Year, 
and to u>w but once a Year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bufhels 
of Barley and Rice, was much more than I could 
confume in a Year ; fo I refolv'd to (bw juft the fame 
Quantity every Year, that I fow'd the laft, in 
Hopes that fuch a Quantity would fully provide me 
with Bread, &c. 

All the while thefe Things were doing, you may 
be fure my Thoughts run many times upon the 
Profpeft of Land which I had feen from the other 
Side of the Ifland > and I was not without fecret 
Wifhes that I were on Shore there, fancying the fee- 
ing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country, 
I might find fome Way or other to convey my- 
felf farther, and perhaps at • laft find fome Means 
of Efcape. 

But all this while I made no Allowance for the 
Dangers of fuch a Condition, and how I might fall 
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch as I 
might have Reafon to think far worfe than the Li- 
ons and Tigers of Africa. That if I once came in- 
to their Power, I fhould run a Hazard more than a 
thoufand to one of being kill'd, and perhaps of be- 
ing eaten ; for I had heard that the People of the 
Carribean Coaft were Canibals, or Man-eaters ; and 
I knew by the Latiude that I could not be far off 

from 



[ M-7] 



from that Shore. That fuppof e they were not Cani- 
bals, yet that they might kill me, as many Europeans 
who had fallen into their Hands had been ferv'd, 
•even when they had been ten or twenty together ; 
much more I that was but one, and could make lit- 
tle or no Defence : All thefe Things, I fay, which I 
ought to have confider'd well of, and did caft up in 
my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my 
Apprehenfions at firft ; but my Head run mightily 
upon the Thought of getting over to the Shore. 

Now I wifh'd for my Boy Xury, and the long 
Boat, with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with 
which I fail'd above a thoufand Miles on the Coaft 
of Africk ; but this was in vain. Then I thought I 
would go and look at our Ship's Boat, which, as I 
have faid, was blown up upon the Shore, a great 
Way in the Storm, when we were firft caft away. 
■She lay almoft where fhe did at firft, but not quite ; 
and was turn'd by the Force of the Waves and the 
Winds almoft Bottom upward, againft a high 
Ridge of Beachy rough Sand ; but no Water about 
her as before. 

If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to 
have launch'd her into the Water, the Boat would 
have done well enough, and I might have gone 
back into the Brafils with her eafily enough ; but I 
might have forefeen, That I could no more turn her, 
and fet her upright upon her Bottom, than I could 
remove the Ifland: However, I went to the 
Woods, and cut Levers and Rollers, and brought 
them to the Boat, refolv'd to try what I could do, 
fuggefting to my felf, That if I could but turn her 
down, I might eafily repair the Damage fhe had 
receiv'd, and fhe would be a very good Boat, and 
I might go to Sea in her very eafily. 

I fpar'd no Pains indeed, in this Piece of fruitlefs 
Toil, and fpent, I think, three or four Weeks a- 

L 2 bout 



[i4«] 



bout it ; at laft finding it impoflible to heave it up 
with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the 
Sand, to undermine it, and fb to make it fall down, 
fetting Pieces of Wood to thruft and guide it right 
in the Fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it 
up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move it 
forward, towards the Water; fo I was forc'd to 
give it over; and yet, though I gave over the 
Hopes of the Boat, my defire to venture over for 
the Main increafed, rather than decreafed, as the 
Means for it feem'd impoflible. 

This at length put me upon thinking, Whether 
it was not poffible to make my felf a Canoe, or Peria- 
gua } fuch as the Natives of thofe Climates make, even 
without Tools, or, as I might fay, without Hands, 
viz. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I not 
only thought poflible, but eafy, and pleafed my felf 
extreamly with the Thoughts of making it, and 
with my having much more Convenience for it than 
any of the Negroes or Indians ; but not at all confi- 
dering the particular Inconveniences which I lay 
under, more than the Indians did, viz. Want ofHands 
to move it, when it was made, into the Water, a 
Difficulty much harder for me to furmount, than 
all the Confequences of Want of Tools could be to 
them ; for what was it to me, That when I had 
chofen a vaft Tree in the Woods, I might with 
much Trouble cut it down, if after I might be a- 
ble with my Tools to hew and dub the Out- fide 
into the proper Shape of a Boat, and burn or cut 
out the In-fide to make it hollow, fo to make a Boat 
of it : If after all this, I muft leave it juft there 
where I found it, and was not able to launch it into 
the Water. 

One would have thought, I could not have had 
the leaft Refleftion upon my Mind of my Circum- 

ftance, 



[ H9 ] 

Itance, while I was making this Boat ; but I fhould 
have immediately thought how I fhould get it in- 
to the Sea ; but my Thoughts were fo intent upon 
my Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once 
confiderd how I fliould get it off of the Land ; and 
it was really in its own Nature more eafy for me 
to guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than about 
forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to fet 
it a float in the Wajer. 

I went to work upon this Boat, the moft like a 
Fool, that ever Man did, who had any of his Senfes 
awake. I pleas'd my felf with the Defign, with- 
out determining whether I was ever able to under- 
take it ; not but that the Difficulty of launching 
my Boat came often into my Head ; but I put a 
Hop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolifh 
Anfwer which I gave my felf, Let's fir/l make i/, 77/ 
warrant Til find Jome Way or other to get it along, when 
Uis done* 

This was a moft prepofterous Method ; but the 
Eagernefs of my Fancy prevail'd, and to work I 
went. I fell'd a Cedar Tree: I queftion much 
whether Solomon ever had fuch a One for the Build- 
ing of the Temple z t JerufaUm. It was five Foot 
ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the 
Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at 
the End of twenty two Foot, after which it lef- 
fen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches : 
It was not without infinite Labour that I fell'd 
this Tree : I was twenty Days hacking and hew- 
ing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen more get- 
ting the Branches and Limbs, and the vaft fpread- 
ing Head of it cut off, which I hack'd and hew'd 
through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpreflible 
Labour : After this, it coft me a Month to fhape 
it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to fbmething 
like the Bottom of a Boat, that it might fwim up- 

L 3 right 



E^o] 



right as it ought to do. It coft me near three 
Months more to clear the In-fide, and work it out 
fo, as to make an exaft Boat of it : This I did in- 
deed without Fire, by meer Malett and Chiffel, and 
by the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought it 
to be a very handfome Periagua, and big enough to 
have carry'd fix and twenty Men, and confequently 
big enough to have carry'd me and all my Cargo. 

When I had gone through this Work, I was ex- 
tremely delighted with it. The Boat was really 
much bigger than I ever faw a Canoe, or Peria- 
gua, that was made of one Tree, in my Life. Ma- 
ny a weary Stroke it had coft, you may be fure ; 
and there remain'd nothing but to get it into the 
Water ; and had I gotten it into the Water, I make 
no queftion but I fnojild have began the maddeftr 
Voyage, and the moft unlikely to be perform'd, 
that ever was undertaken. 

But all my Devices to get it into the Water 
fail'd me ; tho' they coft me infinite Labour too. 
It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water, 
and not more : But the firft Inconvenience was, it 
was up Hill towards the Creek ; well, to take a- 
way this Difcouragement, I refolv'd to dig into 
the Surface of the Earth, and fo make a Declivity.- 
This I begun, and it coft me a prodigious deal of 
Pains; but who grutches Pains, that have their 
Deliverance in View: But when this was work'd 
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was ftill 
much at one ; for I could no more ftir the Canoe y 
than I could the other Boat. 

Then I meafur'd the Diftance of Ground, and 
refolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canal, to bring the Wa- 
ter up to the Canoe, feeing I could not bring the 
Canoe down to the Water : Well, I began this 
Work, and when I began to enter into it, and cal- 
culate how deep it was to be dug, how broad,. 

how 



[is*] 



how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, That by 
the Number of Hands I had, being none but my 
own, it muft have been ten or twelve Years before 
I fhould have gone through with it ; for the Shore 
lay high, fo that at the upper End, it muft have 
been at leaft twenty Foot Deep ; fo at length, tho' 
with great Reluftancy, I gave this Attempt o- 
ver alfo. 

This griev'd me heartily, and now I faw, tho' 
too late* the Folly of beginning a Work before we 
count the Coft; and before we judge rightly of 
our own Strength to go through with it. 

In the middle of this Work, I finifh'd my fourth 
Year in this Place, and kept my Anniverfary with 
the fame Devotion, and with as much Comfort as 
ever before ; for by a conftant Study, and ferious 
Application of the Word of God, and by the Af- 
fiftance of his Grace, I gain'd a different Know- 
ledge from what I had before. I entertain'd diffe- 
rent Notions of Things. I look'd now upon the 
World as a Thing remote, which I had nothing to 
do with, no Expedtation from, and indeed no De- 
fires about : In a Word, I had nothing indeed to 
do with it, nor was ever like to have ; fo I thought 
it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, 
viz. as a Place I had liv'd in, but was come out of 
it ; and well might I fay, as Father Abraham to 
Dives, Between meaud thee is a great Gulpbfx'd. 

In the firft Place, I was remov'd from all the 
Wickednefs of the World here. I had neither the 
Luft of the Flejh) the Luft of the Eye, or the Pride of 
Life. I had nothing to covet ; for I had all that I 
was now capable of enjoying : I was Lord of the 
whole Mannor; or if I pleas'd, I might call my 
felf King,or Emperor over the whole Country which 
I had Pofleffion of. There were no Rivals. I had 
no Competitor, none to difpute Sovereignty or 

L 4 Com- 



[ i5*] 



Command with me. I might have rais'd Ship 
Loadings of Corn ; but I had no ufe for it ; fo I let 
as little grow as I thought enough for my Occafion. 
I had Tortoife or Turtles enough ; but now and 
then one, was as much as I could put to any ufe. I 
had Timber enough to have built a Fleet of Ships. 
I had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to 
have cur'd into Raifins, to have loaded that Fleet, 
when they had been built. 

But all I could make ufe of, was, All that was 
valuable. I had enough to eat, and to fupply my 
Wants, and, what was all the reft to me ? If I 
kilTd more Flefh than I could eat, the Dog muft eat 
it, or the Vermin. If I fow'd more Corn than I 
could eat, it muft be fpoil'd. The Trees that I 
cut down, were lying to rot on the Ground. I 
could make no more ufe of them than for Fewel ; 
and that I had no Occafion for, but to drefs 
my Food. 

In a Word, The Nature and Experience of 
Things dictated to me upon juft Refle&ion, That 
all the good Things of this World, are no farther 
good to us, than they are for our Ufe ; and that 
whatever we may heap up indeed to give others, 
we enjoy juft as much as we can ufe, and no more. 
The moft covetous griping Mifer in the World 
would have been cur'd of the Vice of Covetoufhefe, 
if he had been in my Cafe ; for I poflefs'd infinitely 
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room 
for Defire, except it was of Things which I had 
not, and they were but Trifles, though indeed of 
great Ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Par- 
cel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thirty 
fix Pounds Sterling: Alas! There the nafty 
forry ufelefs Stuff lay ; I had no manner of Bufinefs 
for it ; and I often thought with my felf, That I 
would have given a Handful of it for a Grofs of 

Tobacco* 



[ r 53] 



Tobacco-Pipes, or for a Hand-Mill to grind my 
Corn ; nay, I would have given it all for Sixpenny- 
worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or 
for a Handful of Peafe and Beans y and a Bottle of 
Ink : As it was, I had not the lead Advantage by it, 
or Benefit from it ; but there it lay in a Drawer, 
and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave, in 
the wet Seafon ; and if I had had the Drawer full of 
Diamonds, it had been the fame Cafe ; and they 
had been of no manner of Value to me, becaufe of 
no Ufe. 

I bad now brought my State of Life to be much 
eafier in it felf than it was at firft, and much eafier 
to my Mind, us well as to my Body. I frequently 
fat down to my Meat with Thankfulnefe, and ad- 
mir'd the Hand of God's Providence, which had 
thus fpread my Table in the Wildernefs. I learn'd 
to look more upon the bright Side of my Condi- 
tion, and lefs upon the dark Side ; and to confider 
what I enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted; and 
this gave me fometimes luch fecrct Comforts, that 
I cannot exprefe them ; and which I take Notice 
of here, to put thofe difcontented People in Mind 
of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God 
has given them ; becaufe they fee, and covet fome- 
thing that he has not given them : All our Difcon- 
tents about what we want, appear'd to me, to 
fpring from the Want of Thankfulnefs for what 
we have. 

Another Refle&ion was of great Ufe to me, and 
doubtlefs would be fo to any one that fhould fall 
into fuch Diftrefs as mine was ; and this was, To 
compare my prefent Condition with what I at firft 
expe&ed it fhould be; nay, with what it would 
certainly have been, if the good Providence of 
God had not wonderfully order'd the Ship to be 
caft up nearer to the Shore, where I not only could 

come 



[ r 54] 



come at her, but could bring what I got out of 
her to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort; 
without which, I had wanted for Tools to work, 
Weapons for Defence, or Gun-Powder and Shot 
for getting my Food. 

I ipent whole Hours, I may fay whole Days, in 
representing to my felf in the moft lively Colours* 
how I muii have afted, if I had got nothing out 
of the Ship. How I could not have fo much as 
got any Food, except Fifh and Turtles ; and that 
as it was long before I found any of them, I muffc 
have perifh'd firft. That I fhould have liv'd, if I 
had not perifh'd, like a meer Savage. That if I 
had kiird a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance* 
I had no way to flea or open them, or part the 
Fleih from the Skin, and the Bowels, 6r to cut it 
up ; but muft gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it 
with my Claws like a Beaft. 

Thefe Reflections made me very fenfible of the 
Goodnefs of Providence to me, and very thankful 
for my prefent Condition, with all its Hardfhips 
and Misfortunes : And this Part alfo I cannot but 
recommend to the Reflection of thofe, who are apt 
in their Mifery to fay, Is any Affiiftion like mine i 
Let them confider, How much worfe the Cafes of 
fome People are, and their Cafe might have been,, 
if Providence had thought fit. 

I had another Reflection which aflifted me alfo 
to comfort my Mind with Hopes ; and this was* 
comparing my prefent Condition with what I had 
deferv'd, and had therefore Reafon to expect from 
the Hand of Providence. I had liv'd a dreadful 
Life, perfedtly deftitute of the Knowledge and Fear 
of God. I had been well inftruCted by Father and 
Mother ; neither had they been wanting to me, in 
their early Endeavours, to infufe a religious Awe 
of God into my Mind, a Senfe of my Duty, and 

of 



[ J 55 ] 



of what the Nature and End of my Being, required 
of me. But alas ! falling early into the Seafaring 
Life, which of all the Lives is the mod deftitute 
of the Fear of God, though his Terrors are al- 
ways before them; I fay, falling early into the 
Seafaring Life, and into Seafaring Company, all that 
little Senfe of Religion which I had entertain'd, 
was laugh'd out of me by my Mefs-Mates, by a 
harden'd defpifing of Dangers ; and the Views of 
Death, which grew habitual to me; by my long 
Abfence from all Manner of Opportunities to con- 
verfe with any thing but what was like my felf, 
or to hear any thing that was good, or tended to- 
wards it. 

So void was I of every Thing that was good, or 
of the leaft Senfe of what I was, or was to be, 
that in the greateft Deliverances I enjoy'd, fuch 
as my Efcape from Sallee ; my being taken up by 
the Portuguese Matter of the Ship ; my being plan- 
ted fo well in the Brqfils ; my receiving the Cargo 
from Englandy and the like ; I never had once the 
Word Thank God, fo much as on my Mind, or in my 
Mouth ; nor in the greateft Diftrefs, had I fo much 
as a Thought to pray to him, or fo much as to 
fay, Lord have Mercy upon me ; no nor to mention 
the Name of God, unlefs it was to fwear by, and 
blafpheme it. 

I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for 
many Months, as I have already obferv'd, on the 
Account of my wicked and hardned Life paft ; and 
when I look'd about me and confidered what parti- 
cular Providences had attended me fince my com- 
ing into this Place, and how God had dealt boun- 
tifully with .me ; had not only punifhed me lefs than 
my Iniquity had deferv'd, but had fo plentifully pro- 
vided for me ; this gave me great hopes that my 

Repen- 



[i5<5] 



Repentance was accepted, and that God hath yet 
Mercy in ftore for me. 

With thefe Refleftions I work'd my Mind up, 
not only to Refignation to th$ Will of God in the 
prefent Difpofition of my Circumftances; but even 
to a fincere Thankfulnes for my Condition, and that 
I who was yet a living Man, ought not to com- 
plain, feeing I had not the due Punifliment of my 
Sins ; that I enjoy 'd fo many Mercies which I had 
no reafon to have expe&ed in that Place; that I 
ought never more to repine at my Condition but to 
rejoyce, and to give daily Thanks for that daily 
Bread, which nothing but a Croud of Wonders 
could have brought. That I ought to confider I 
had been fed even by Miracle, even as great as that 
of feeding Elijah by Ravens ; nay, by a long Se- 
ries of Miracles, and that I could hardly have 
nam'd a Place in the unhabitable Part of the 
World where I could have been caft more to my 
Advantage : A Place, where as I had no Society, 
which was my Affli&ion on one Hand, fo I found 
no ravenous Beaft, no furious Wolves or Tygers 
to threaten my Life, no venomous Creatures or 
poifonous, which I might feed on to my Hurt, no 
Savages to murther and devour me. 

In a word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one 
way, fo it was a Life of Mercy, another; and I 
wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort, but 
to be able to make my Sence of God's Goodnefe to 
me, and Care over me in this Condition, be my 
daily Confoktion ; and after I did make a juft 
Improvement of thefe things, I went away and 
was no more fad. 

I had now been here fb long, that many Things 
which I brought on Shore for my Help, were either 
quite gone, or very much wafted and near {pent. 

My 



[^l 



My Ink, as I obferved, had been gone fbmetimev 
all but a very little, which I eek'd out wkh Wal- 
ter a little and a little, till it was fb pale it fcarce 
left any Appearance of black upon the Paper : As 
long as it lafted, I made ufe of it to minuite down 
the Days of the Month on which any remarka- 
able Thing happen'd to me, and firft by cafting up 
Times paft : I remember that there was a ftrange 
Concurrence of Days, in the various Provi- 
dences which befel me ; and which, if I had been 
fuperftitioufly inclin'd to obferve Days as Fatal or 
Fortunate, I might have had Reafon to have look'd 
upon with a great deal of Curiofity. 

Firft I had obferved, that the fame Day that I 
broke away from my Father and my Friends, and 
run away to Hull, in order to go to Sea ; the fame 
Day afterwards I was taken by the Sally Man of 
War, and made a Slave. 

The fame Day of the Year that I efcaped out of 
the Wreck of that Ship in Yarmouth Rodes, that 
fame Day- Year afterwards I made my efcape from. 
Sallee in the Boat. 

The fame Day of the Year I was born on (viz.) 
the 30th of September, that fame Day, I had my 
Life fb miraculoufly faved 16 Year after, when I 
was caft on Shore in this Ifland, fb that my wicked 
Life, and my fblitary Life begun both on a Day. 

The next Thing to my Ink's, being wafted, was 
that of my Bread, I mean the Bisket which I 
brought out of the Ship, this I had husbanded to 
the laft degree, allowing my felf but one Cake of 
Bread a Day for above a Year, and yet I was quite 
without Bread for near a Year before I got any 
Corn of my own, and great Reafon I had to be 
thankful that I had any at all, the getting it being, 
as has been already obferved, next to miraculous. 

My 



[i58] 



My Cloaths began to decay too mightily : As to 
Linnen, I had had none a good while, except fome 
chequer'd Shirts which I found in the Chefts of the 
other Seamen, and which I carefully preferved, be- 
caufe many times I could bear no other Cloaths 
on but a Shirt ; and it was a very great help to me 
that I had among all the Men's Cloaths of die Ship 
almoft three dozen of Shirts. There were alfo fe- 
veral thick Watch Coats of the Seamens, which 
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear ; 
and tho' it is true, that the Weather was fo violent 
hot, that there was no need of Cloaths, yet I could 
not go quite naked ; no, tho' I had been inclin'd to 
it, which I was not, nor could not abide the thoughts 
of it, tho' I was all alone. 

The Reafon why I could not go quite naked, 
was, I could not bear the heat of the Sun fo 
well when quite naked, as with fome Cloaths on ; 
nay, the very Heat frequently bliftered my Skin ; 
whereas with a Shirt on, the Air itfelf made fome 
Motion and whittling under that Shirt was twofold 
cooler than without it, no more could I ever bring 
my felf to go out in the heat of Sun, without a 
Cap or a Hat ; the heat of the Sun beating with 
fuch Violence as it does in that Place, would give 
me the Head-ach prefently, by darting fo dire&ly 
on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on, fo that I could . 
not bear it, whereas, if I put on my Hat, it would 
prefently go away. 

Upon thofe Views I began to confider about put- 
ting the few Rags I had, which I calTd Cloaths, 
into fome. Order ; I had worn out all the Waft- 
coats I had, and my Bufinefs was now to try if I 
could- not make Jackets out of the great Watch- 
Coats which I had by me, and with fuch other 
Materials as I had, fo I fet to Work a Tayiering, 
or rather indeed a Botching, for I made moft 

piteous 



[i59] 



piteous Work of it. However, I made fhift to 
make two or three new Waftcoats, which I hoped 
wou'd ferve me a great while ; as for Breeches or 
Drawers, I made but a very forry (hift indeed, till 
afterward. 

I have mentioned that I faved the Skins of all 
the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones, 
and I had hung them up ftretch'd out with Sticks 
in the Sun, by which means fome of them were fo 
dry and hard that they were fit for little, but others 
it feems were very ufeful. The firft thing I made . 
of thefe was a great Cap for my Head, with the 
Hair on the out Side to fhoor off the Rain ; and 
this I perform *d fo well, that after this I made me 
a Suit of Cloaths wholly of thefe Skins, that is to 
fay, a Waftcoat, and Breeches open at Knees, and 
both loofe, for they were rather wanting to keep 
me cool than to keep me warm. I muft not omit 
to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made ; 
for if I was a bad Carpenter, I was a worfe Tayler. 
However, they were fuch as I made very good 
fhift with ; and when I was abroad, if it happen'd 
to rain, the Hair of my Waftcoat and Cap being 
outermoft, I was kept very dry. 

After this I fpent a great deal of Time and Pains 
to make me an Umbrella ; I was indeed in great 
want of one, and had a great Mind to make one ; 
I had feen them made in the Brafils y where they 
are very ufeful in the great Heats which are there. 
And I felt the Heats every jot as great here, and 
greater too, being nearer the Equinox ; befides, as 
I was oblig'd to be much abroad, it was a mod 
ufeful thing to me, as well for the Rains as the 
Heats. I took a world of Pains at it, and- was a 
great while before I could make any thing likely to 
hold ; nay, after I thought I had hit the Way, I 
fpoil'd 2 or 3 before I made one to my Mind ; but 

at 



[i6o] 



at laft I made one that afwer'd indifferently well r 
The main Difficulty I fouhd was to make it to let 
down. I could make it to fpread, but if it did not 
let down too, and draw in, it was not portable for 
me any Way but juft over my Head, which wou'd 
not do. However, at laft, as I faid, I made 
one to anfwer, and covered it with Skins, the Hair 
upwards, fo that it caft off the Rains like a Pent- 
houfe, and kept off the Sun fo effeftually, that I 
could walk out in the hotteft of the Weather with 
greater Advantage than I could before in the cooleft > 
and when I had no need of it, cou'd clofe it and 
carry it under my Arm. 

Thus I liv'd mighty comfortably, my Mind be- 
ing entirely compofed by refigning to the Will of 
God, and throwing my felf wholly upon the Di£ 
pofal of his Providence. This made my Life bet- 
ter than fociable, for when I began to regret the 
want of Converfation, I would ask my felf whether 
thus converfing mutually with my own Thoughts, 
and, as I hope I may fay, with even God himfelf 
by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmoft 
Enjoyment of humane Society in the World. 

I cannot fay that after this, for five Years, any 
extraordinary thing happened to me, but I liv'd on 
in the fame Courfe, in the fame Pofture and Place, 
juft as before ; the chief things I was employ'd in, 
befides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and 
Rice, and curing my Raifins, of both which I al- 
ways kept up juft enough to have fufficient Stock 
of one Year's Provifions beforehand. I fay, befides 
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going 
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a 
Canoe, which at laft I finilhed. So that by dig- 
ging a Canal to it of fix Foot wide, and four Foot 
deep, I brought it into the Creek, almoft half a 
Mile. As for the firft, which was fo vaftly big, 

as 



t i6l J 

as I made it without confidering before-hand, as I 
ought to do, how I fhould be able to launch it ; io 
never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring 
the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lye where it 
was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wifer 
next Time : Indeed, the next Time, tho* I could 
not get a Tree proper for it, and in a Place where 
I could not get the Water to it, at any lefs Diftance, 
than as I have faid, near half a Mile ; yet as I faw 
it was pra&icable at laft, I never gave it over ; and 
though I was near two Years about it, yet I never 
grutch'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat 
to go off to Sea at laft. 

However, though my little Periagau was fi- 
nifti'd ; yet the Size of it was not at all anfwerable 
to the Defign which I had in View, when I made 
the firft ; I mean, Of venturing over to the Terra 
Firma, where it was above forty Miles broad ; ac- 
cordingly, the Smallnefs of my Boat affiifted to put 
an End to that Defign, and now I thought no more 
of it : But as I had a Boat, my next Defign was to 
make a Tour round the Ifland ; for as I had been on 
the other Side, in one Place, crofling as I have al- 
ready defcrib'd it, over the Land ; fo the Difcove- 
ries I made in that little Journey, made me very ea- 
ger to fee other Parts of the Coaft; and now I had 
a Boat, I thought of nothing but failing round the 
Ifland. 

For this Purpofe, that I might do every Thing 
with Difcretion and Confideration, I fitted up a 
little Maft to my Boat, and made a Sail to it, out 
of fome of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay 
in ftore ; and of which I had a great Stock by me. 

Having fitted my Maft and Sail, and try'd the 
Boat, I found ftie would fail very well : Then I 
made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either End of my 
Boat, to put Provifions, Neceflaries and Ammuni- 

M tion, 



[i6a] 



tion, &V. into, to be kept dry, either from Rain, or 
the Sprye of the Sea ; and a little long hollow Place I 
cut in the In-fide of the Boat, where I could lay 
my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over it to 
keep it dry. 

I fix'd my Umbrella alfo in a Step at the Stern, 
like a Maft, to ftand over my Head, and keep the 
Heat of the Sun off of me like an Auning ; and 
thus I every now and then took a little Voyage 
upon the Sea, but never went far out, nor far from 
the little Creek; but at laft being eager to view 
the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I refolv'd 
upon my Tour, and accordingly I viftuall'd my 
Ship for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of my 
Loaves (Cakes I fhould rather call them) of Bar- 
ley Bread, an Earthen Pot full of parch'd Rice, a 
Food I eat a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum, 
half a Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more, 
and two large Watch-coats, of thofe which, as I 
mention'd before, I had fav'd out of the Seamen's 
Chefts ; thefe I took, one to lye upon, and the o- 
ther to cover me in the Night. 

It was the fixth of November y in the fixth Year 
of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you pleafe, 
That I fet out on this Voyage, and I found it much 
longer than I expeded ; for though the Ifland it felf 
was not very large, yet when I came to the Eaft 
Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks lye out 
above two Leagues into the Sea, fome above Wa- 
ter, fome under it ; and beyond that, a Shoal of 
Sand, lying dry half a League more ; fo that I was 
oblig'd to go a great Way out to Sea to double the 
Point. 

When firft I difcover'd them, I was going to give 
over my Enterprife, and come back again, not 
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to 
Sea ; and above all, doubting how I fhould get back 

again ; 



[ifc] 



again ; fo I came to an Anchor ; for I had made 
me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken 
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship. 

Having feeur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and 
went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which 
feem'd to over-look that Point, where I faw the 
full Extent of it, and refolv'd to venture. 

In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I 
flood, I perceiv'd a ftrong, and indeed, a moft fu- 
rious Current, which Run to the Eaft y and even 
came clofe to the Point; and I took the more No- 
tice of it, becaufe I faw there might be fome Dan- 
ger i that when I came into it, I might be carry'd 
out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able 
to make the Ifland again ; and indeed, had I not 
gotten firft up upon this Hill, I believe it would 
have been fo ; for there was the fame Current on 
the other Side the Ifland, only, that it kt off at 
a farther Diftance ; and I faw there was a ftrong 
Eddy under the Shore ; fo I had nothing to do but 
to get in out of the firft Current, and I fhould pre- 
sently be in an Eddy. 

I lay here, however, two Days; becaufe the 
Wind blowing pretty frefh at E. S. E. and that 
being juft contrary to the faid Current, made a 
great Breach of the Sea upon the Point ; fo that it 
was not -fafe for me to keep too clofe to the Shore 
for the Breach, nor to go too far off becaufe of 
the Stream. 

The Third Day in the Morning, the Wind ha* 
ving abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I 
ventur'd ; but I am a warning Piece again, to all 
rafh and ignorant Pilots ; for no fooner was I come 
to the Point, when even I was not my Boat's 
Length from the Shore, but I found my felf in a 
great Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice 
of a MiH : It carry'd my Boat a long with it 

M 2 with 



[i6 4 ] 

with fuch Violence, That all I could do, could 
not keep her fo much as on the Edge of it ; but I 
found it hurry'd me farther and farther out from 
the Eddy, which was on my left Hand. There 
was no Wind ftirring to help me, and all I could 
do with my Paddlers fignify'd nothing, and now I 
began to give my felf over for loft ; for as the Cur- 
rent was on both Sides the Ifland, I knew in a few 
Leagues Diftance they muft joyn again, and then 
I was irrecoverably gone ; nor did I fee any Poffi- 
bility of avoiding it ; fo that I had no Prolpedt be- 
fore me but of Perifhing ; not by the Sea, for that 
was calm enough, but of ftarving for Hunger. I 
had indeed found a Tortoife on the Shore, as big 
almoft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the 
Boat ; and I haa a great Jar of frefli Water, that is 
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots ; but what was all 
this to being driven into the vaft Ocean, where to 
be fure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or I- 
fland, for a thoufand Leagues at leaft. 

And now I faw how eafy it was for the Provi- 
dence of God to make the moft miferable Condi- 
tion Mankind could be in worfe. Now I look'd 
back upon my defolate folitary Ifland, as the moft 
pleafant Place in the World, and all the Happinefe 
my Heart could wifh for, was to be but there a- 
gain. I ftretch'd out my Hands to it with eager 
Wifties. O happy Defart, faid I, I fhall never fee 
thee more. O miferable Creature, faid I, whe- 
ther am I going : Then I reproach'd my felf with 
my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at 
my folitary Condition ; and now what would I give 
to be on Shore there again. Thus we never fee 
the true State of our Condition, till it is illuftrated 
to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value 
what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is fcarce 
poffible to imagine the Confternation I was now in* 

being 



[165] 



being driven from my beloved Ifland (for fo it ap- 
pear'd to me now to be) into the wide Ocean, al- 
rnoft two Leagues, and in the utmoft Defpair of 
ever recovering it again. However, I work'd hard, 
till indeed my Strength was almoft exhaufted, and 
kept my Boat as much to the Northward^ that is, 
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy 
lay on, as poflibly I could ; when about Noon, as 
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a lit- 
tle Breeze of Wind in my Face, fpringing up from 
the S. S. E. This cheard my Heart a little, and 
efpecially when in about half an Hour more, it 
blew a pretty fmall gentle Gale. By this Time I 
was gotten at a frightful Diftance from the Ifland, 
and had the leaft Cloud or haizy Weather interven'd, 
I had been undone another Way too ; for I had no 
Compafs on Board, and fhould never have known 
how to have fteer'd towards the Ifland, if I had 
but once loft Sight of it ; but the Weather conti- 
nuing clear, I apply'd my felf to get up my Maft 
again, fpread my Sail, ftanding away to the North, 
as much as poflible, to get out of the Current. 

Juft as I had fet my Maft and Sail, and the Boat 
began to ftretch away, I faw even by the Clearnefs 
of the Water, fome Alteration of the Current was 
near ; for where the Current was fo ftrong, the Wa- 
ter was foul ; but perceiving the Water clear, I 
found the Current abate, and prefently I found to 
the Eafl y at about half a Mile, a Breach of the Sea 
upon fome Rocks ; thefe Rocks I found caus'd the 
Current to part again, and as the main Srrefs of it 
ran away more Southerly , leaving the Rocks to the 
Nortb-Eaft ; fo the other return'd by the Repulfe of 
rhe Rocks, and made a ftrong Eddy, which run 
back again to the North-TVeji> with \ very ftiarp 
Stream. 

M 3 They 



[166] 



They who know what it is to have a Reprieve 
brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be refcu- 
ed from Thieves juft a going to murther them, or, 
who have been in fuch like Extremities, may guefs 
what my prefent Surprife of Joy was, and how glad- 
ly I put my Boat into the Stream of this Eddy, and 
the Wind alfo freflining, how gladly I fpread my 
Sail to it, running chearfully before the Wind, and 
with a ftrong Tide or Eddy under Eoot. 

This Eddy carryed me about a League in my 
Way back again diredly towards the Ifland, but 
about two Leagues more to the Northward than 
the Current which carried me away at firft ; fo that 
when I came near the Ifland, I found my felf open 
to the Northern Shore of it, that is to fay, the Or 
ther End of the Ifland oppofite to that which I 
went out from. 

When I had made fbmething more than a League 
of Way by the help of this Current or Eddy, I fouud 
it was fpent and ferv'd me no farther. However, I 
found that being between the two great Currents,. 
(viz. ) that on the South Side which had hurried 
me away, and that on the North which lay a- 
bout a League on the other Side. I fay between thefe 
two, in the wake of the Ifland, I found the Water at 
leaft ftill and running no Way, and having (till a 
Breeze of Wind fair for me, I kept on (leering direft- 
ly for the Ifland, tho' not making fuch frefli Way as 
1 did before. 

About four a-Clock in the Evening, being then, 
within about a League of the Ifland, I found the 
Point of the Rocks which occafioned this. Difefter,, 
ftretching out as is defcrib'd before to the South- 
ward, and cafting off the Current more Southward- 
ly, had of Courfe made another Eddy to the North,, 
and this I found very ftrong, but not diredtly fetting 
the Way my Courfe lay which was due Weft,, but 

almoft 



[i6 7 ] 



almoft full North. However having a frefli Gale, 
I ftretch'd a-crofs this Eddy flanting North-weft, 
and in about an Hour came within about a Mile of 
the Shore, where it being fmooth Water, I foon got 
to Land. 

When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave 
God Thanks for my Deliverance, refolving to lay 
afide all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my Boat, 
and refreshing my felf with fuch Things as I had, 
I brought my Boat clofe to the Shore in a little 
Cove that I had fpy'd under fome Trees, and lay'd 
me down to fleep, being quite fpent with the La- 
bour and Fatigue of the Voyage. 

I was now at a great Li>fs which Way to get 
Home with my Boat, I had run fo much Hazard, 
and knew too much the Cafe to think of attempt- 
ing it by the Way I went out, and what might be 
at the other Side ( I mean the Weft Side ) I knew 
not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures ; 
fo I only refolved in the Morning to make my Way 
Weftward along the Shore and to fee if there was 
no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safe- 
ty, fo as to have her again if I wanted her ; in about 
three Mile or thereabout coafting the Shore, I 
came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over, 
which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet 
or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour 
for my Boat and where fhe lay as if fhe had been in 
a little Dock made on Purpofe for her. Here I 
put in, and having ftow'd my Boat very fafe, I went 
on Shore to look about me and fee where I was. 

1 foon found 1 had but a little pa ft by the Place 
where I had been before, when I traveled on Foot 
to that Shore ; ib taking nothing out of my Boat, 
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was ex- 
ceeding hot, I began my March : The Way was 
comfortable enough after fuch a Voyage as I had 

M 4 been 



[i68] 



beea upon, and I reach'd my old Bower in the 
Evening, where I found every thing (landing as I 
left it ; for I always kept it in good Order, be- 
ing, as I faid before, my Country Houfe. 

I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the 
Shade to reft my Limbs ; for I was very weary, 
and fell afleep : But judge you, if you can, that 
read my Story, what a Surprize I muft be in, when 
I was wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me 
by my Name feveral times, Robin, Robin , Robin 
Crufoe, poor Robin Crufoe > where are you Robin Cru- 
foe ? Where are you ? Where have you been ? 

I was fo dead afleep at firft, being fatigu'd with 
Rowing, or Paddling, as it is calTd, the firft 
Part of the Day, and with walking the latter Part, 
that I did not wake thoroughly, but dozing be- 
tween fleeping and waking, thought I dream'd 
that fome Body fpoke to me : But as the Voice 
continu'd to repeat Robin Crufoe, Robin Crufoe, at 
laft I began to wake more perfectly, and was at 
firft dreadfully frighted, and ftarted up in the ut- 
moft Confternation : But no fooner were my Eyes 
open, but I faw my Poll fitting on the Top of the 
Hedge ; and immediately knew that it was he that 
fpoke to me ; for juft in fuch bemoaning Language 
1 had ufed to talk to him, and teach him ; and he 
had learn'd it fo perfectly, that he would fit upon my 
Finger, and lay his Bill clofe to my Face, and cry, 
Poor Robin Crufoe, Where are you ? Where have you 
been ? How come you here ? And fuch things as I had 
taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the Parrot, 
and that indeed it could be no Body elfe, it was 
a good while before .1 : could . compofe my felf: 
Firft, I was amazed. how the Creature got thither, 
and then, how he fhould juft keep about the Place, 
and no where elfe : But as I was well fatisfied it 

conld 



[i6 9 ] 



could be no Body but honeft Poll, I got it over ; 
and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his 
Name Pol7> the fociable Creature came to me, 
and fat upon my Thumb, as he ufed to do, and 
continu'd talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, and 
bow did I come here t and where bad I Been ? juft as 
if he had been overjoy 'd to fee me again ; and fo 
I carry'd him Home along with me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for 
fome time, and had enough to do for many Days 
to fit ftill, and refleft upon the Danger I had been 
in : I would have been very glad to have had 
my Boat again on my Side of the Ifland ; but I 
knew not how it was pra&icable to get it about 
as to the Eaft Side of the Ifland, which I had 
gone round ; I knew well enough there was no ven- 
turing that Way ; my very heart would flirink, and 
my very Blood run chill but to think of it : And 
as to the other Side of the Ifland, I did not know 
how it might be there ; but fuppofing the Current 
ran with the fame Force againft the Shore at the 
Eaft as it pafs'd by it on the other, I might run 
the fame Risk of being driven down the Stream, 
and carry'd by the Ifland, as I had been before, 
of being carry'd away from it; fo with thefe 
Thoughts I contented my felf to be without 
any Boat, though it had been the Produft of fo 
many Months Labour to make it, and of fo many 
more to get it unto the Sea. 

In this Government of mf Temper, I remain'd 
near a Year, liv'd a very edate retir'd Life, as 
you may well fuppofe ; and my Thoughts being 
very much compofed as to my Condition, and 
fully comforted in refigning my felf to the Dif- 
pofitions of Providence, I thought I liv'd really 
very happily in all things, except that of So- 
ciety. 

I im- 



r 



[ *7° 1 



I improv'd my felf in this time in all the mecha- 
nick Exercifes which my Neceflities put me upon 
applying my felf to, and I believe cou'd, upon Occa- 
fion, make a very good Carpenter^ efpecially confi- 
dering how few Tools I had. 

Befides this, I arrived at an unexpe&ed Perfe&i- 
on in my Earthen Ware, and contriv'd well enough 
to make them with a Wheel, which I found infi- 
nitely eafyer and better; becaufe I made things 
round and fhapable, which before were filthy 
things indeed to look on. But I think I was never 
more vain of my own Performance, or more joyful 
for any thing I found out , than for my being able 
. to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was a ve- 
ry ugly clumfy thing, when it was done, and only 
burnt red like other -Earthen Ware, yet as it was 
hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I was 
exceedingly comforted with it ; for I had been al- 
ways ufed to fmoke , and there were Pipes in the 
Ship, but I forgot them at firft, not knowing that 
there was Tobacco in the Ifland ; and afterwards, 
when I fearch'd the Ship again, I could not come at 
any Pipes at all. 

In my Wicker Ware alfb I improved much, and 
made abundance of neceflary Baskets, as well as 
my Invention fhew'd me, tho* not very handfome, 
yet they were fuch as were very handy and conve- 
nient for my laying things up in, or fetching things- 
home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat abroad,, 
I could hang it up in a Tree, flea it, and drefe it* 
and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in a Basket, 
and the like by a Turtle, I could cut it up, take 
out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of the Flefh, 
which was enough for me, and bring them 
home in a Basket, and leave the reft be- 
hind me. Alfo large deep Baskets were my Recei- 
vers for my Corn, which I always rubb'd out as 

foon 



['71] 



fbon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great 
Baskets. 

I began now to perceive my Powder abated con- 
siderably , and this was a Want which it was im- 
poflible for me to fupply, and I began ferioufly to 
confider what I muft do when I fhould have no 
more Powder ; that is to fay, how I fhould do to 
kill any Goat. I had, as is obferv'd in the third 
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred 
her up tame, and I was in hope of getting a He- 
Goat, but I could not by any Means bring it to 
pafs, 'till my Kid grew an old Goat ; and I could 
never find in my Heart to kill her, till (he dy'd at 
laft of meer Age. 

But being now in the eleventh Year of my Refi- 
dence, and, as I have faid, my Ammunition grow- 
ing low, I fet my felf to ftudy fome Art to trap and 
fiiare the Goats, to fee whether I could not catch 
fome of them alive, and particularly I wanted a 
She-Goat great with young. 

To this Purpofe I made Snares to hamper them, 
and I do believe they were more than once taken 
in them, but my Tackle was not good, for I had 
no Wire, and I always found them broken, and 
my Bait devoured. 

At length I refolv'd to try a Pit-fall, fo I dug fe- 
veral large Pits in the Earth, in Places Where I 
had obferv'd the Goats ufed to feed, and over thefe 
Pits I plac'd Hurdles of my own making too, 
with a great Weight upon them ; and feveral times 
I put Ears of Barley, and dry Rice, without fet- 
ting the Trap, and I could eafily perceive that the 
Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn, for I 
could fee the Mark of their Feet. At length I fet 
three Traps in one Night, and going the next 
Morning I found them all (landing, and yet the 
Bait eaten and gone : This was very difcouraging. 

How- 



[!7^] 

However, I alter'd my Trap, and, not to trouble you 
with Particulars, going one Morning to fee my Trap, 
I found in one of them a large old He-Goat, and 
in one of the other, three Kids, a Male and two^ 
Females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with 
him, he was fo fierce I durft not go into the Pit to 
him ; that is to fay, to go about to bring him away 
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have 
kill'd him, but that was not my Bufinefs, nor would 
it anfwer my End. So I e'en let him out , and he 
ran away as if he had been frighted out of 
his Wits : But I had forgot then what I learn'd af- 
terwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon. If I 
had let him ftay there three or four Days without 
Food, and then have carry 'd him fome Water to 
-drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been 
as tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty 
fagacious tradable Creatures where they are well 
ufed. 

However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing 
no better at that time ; then I went to the three 
Kids, and taking them one by one , I tyed them 
with Strings together, and with iome Difficulty 
brought them all home. 

It was a good while before they woud feed, but 
throwing them fome fweet Corn , it tempted them 
and they began to be tame ; and now I found that 
if I expefted to fupply my felf with Goat-Flefh 
when I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding 
fome up tame was my only way, when perhaps 
I might have them about my Houfe like a Flock 
of Sheep. 

But then it prefently occurr'd to me, that I muft 
keep the tame from the wild, or elfe they would al- 
ways run wild when they grew up, and the only 
Way for this was to have fome enclofed Piece of 

Ground, 



L ?73] 



Ground, well fenc'd either with Hedge or Pale, to 
keep them in fo effectually, that thofe within might 
not break out, or thofe without break in. 

This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of 
Hands, yet as I faw there was an abfolute Necef- 
fity of doing it, my firft Piece of Work was to 
find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz. where there 
was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water 
for them to drink, and Cover to keep them from 
the Sun. 

Thofe who underftand fuch Enclofures will think 
I had very little Contrivance, when I pitch'd. upon 
a Place very proper for all thefe , being a plain o- 
pen Piece of Meadow-Land, or Savanna, (as our 
People call it in the Weftern Collonies,) which had 
two or three little Drills of frefh Water in it , and 
at one end was very woody. I fay they will fmile 
at my Forecaft. when I fhall tell them I began my 
enclosing of this Piece of Ground in fuch a man- 
ner, that my Hedge or Pale muft have been at leaft 
two Mile about. Nor was the Madnefs of it fo 
great as to the Compafs, for if it was ten Mile a- 
bout I was like to have time enough to do it in. 
But I did not confider that my Goats would be 
as wild in fo much Compafs as if they had had the 
whole Ifland, and I ftiould-have fo much Room 
to chace them in, that I fhould never catch 
them. 

My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe, 
about fifty Yards, when this Thought occurr'd 
to me , fo I prefently ftopt fhort, and for the firft 
beginning I refolv'd to enclofe a Piece of about 1 50 
Yards in length, and 100 Yards in breadth, which 
as it would maintain as many as I fhould 
have in any reafonable time, fo as my Flock en- 
creafed, I could add more Ground to my En- 

clofure. 

This 



[ »74] 



This was a&ing with fome Prudence, and I went 
to work with Courage. I was about three Months 
hedging in the firft Piece, and till I had done it I 
tether'd the three Kids in the beft part of it , and 
us'd them to feed as near me as poflible to make 
them familiar ; and very often I would go and car- 
ry them fome Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice, 
and feed them out of my Hand ; fo that after my 
Enclosure was finifhed, and I let them loofe, they 
would follow me up and down , bleating after me 
for a handful of Corn. 

This anfwer'd my End, and in about a Year and 
half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids 
and all ; and in two Years more I had three and 
forty, befides feveral that I took and kill'd for my 
Food. And after that I enclofed five feveral Pie- 
ces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens to 
drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and 
Gates out of one Piece of Ground into ano- 
ther. 

But this was not all, for now I not only had 
Goats Flefh to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk 
too , a thing which indeed in my beginning I did 
not fo much as think of, and which, when it came 
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur- 
prize. For now I fet up my Dairy, and had fome- 
times a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day, And as 
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every 
Creature, diftates even naturally how to make ufe 
of it ; fo I that had never milk'd a Cow, much lefs 
a Goat, or feen Butter or Cheefe made, very rea- 
dily and handily, tho' after a great many Eflays 
and Mifcarriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe 
at laft, and never wanted it afterwards. 

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his 
Creatures, even in thofe Conditions in which they 
feem'd to be overwhelm'd in Deftruftion. How 

can 



[ 175 ] 

can he fweeten the bittereft Providences, and give 
us Caufe to praife him for Dungeons and Prifons. 
What a Table was here fpread for me in a Wilder- 
nefe, where I faw nothing at firft but to perifti for 
Hunger. 

It would have made a Stoick finile to have teen, 
-me and my little Family fit down to Dinner; there 
was my Majefty the Prince and Lord of the whole 
Ifland ; I had the Lives of all my Subje&s at my 
abfolute Command. I could hang, draw, give 
Liberty, and take it away, and no Rebels among 
all my Subleds. 

Then to fee how like a King I din'd too all 
alone, attended by my Servants, Poll, as if he had 
keen my Favourite, was the only Perfon permitted 
to talk to me. My Dog who. was now grown ve- 
ry old and crazy, and had found no Species to 
multiply his Kind upon, fat always at my Right 
Hand, and two Cats, one on one Side the 
Table, and one on the other, expefting now and 
then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of fpe- 
•cial Favour. 

But thefe were not the two Cats which I brought 
on Shore at firft, for they were both of them dead, 
and had been interr'd near my Habitation by my 
♦own Hand ; but one of them having multiply 'd by 
I know not what Kind of Creature, thefe were 
two which I had preferv'd tame, whereas the 
reft run wild in the Woods, and became indeed 
troublefom to me at laft ; for they would often come 
into my Houfe, and plunder me too, till at laft I 
was obliged to ihoot them, and did kill a great 
many; at length they left me with this Atten- 
dance, and in this plentiful Manner I lived ; nei- 
ther could I be faid to want any thing but Socie- 
ty, and of that in fome time after this, I was like 
to have too much. 

I was 



[176] 



I was fomething impatient, as I have obferv'd, 
to have the Ufe of my Boat ; though very loath to 
run any more Hazards ; and therefore fometimes I 
fat contriving Ways to get her about the Ifland, 
and at other Times I fat my felf down contented e- 
nough without her. But I had a ftrange Uneafinefs 
in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Ifland, 
where, as I have faid, in my laft Ramble, I went up 
the Hill to fee how the Shore lay, and how the 
Current fet, that I might fee what I had to do : 
This Inclination encreas'd upon me every Day, and 
at length I refolv'd to travel thither by Land, fol- 
lowing the Edge of the Shore, I did fo : But had 
any one in England been to meet fuch a Man as I 
was, it muft either have frighted them, or raised a 
great deal of Laughter ; and as I frequently flood 
ftill to look at my felf, I could not but fmile at the 
Notion of my travelling through Torkjhire with fuch 
an Equipage, and in fuch a Drefs : Be pleas'd to 
take a Scetch of my Figure as follows, 

I had a great high fhapelefs Cap, made of a 
Goat's Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as 
well to keep the Sun from me, as to fhoot the Rain 
off from running into my Neck ; nothing being fo 
hurtful in thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the 
Flefh under the Qoaths. 

I had a fhort Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts co- 
ming down to about the middle of my Thighs ; 
and a Pair of open-knee'd Breeches of the fame, the 
Breeches were made of the Skin of an old He-goat, 
whofe Hair hung down fuch a Length on either 
Side, that like Pantaloons it reacted to the middle of 
my Legs ; Stockings and Shoes I had none, but had 
made me a Pair of fbme-things, I fcarce know 
what to call them, like Buskins to flap over my 
Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatter-dafhes ; 

but 



C in ] 



but of a moft barbarous Shape, as indeed were all 
the reft of my Cloaths. 

I had on a broad Belt of Goat's-Skin dry'd, 
which I drew together with two Thongs of the 
fame, inftead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog 
on either Side of this. Inftead of a Sword and a 
Dagger, hung a little Saw and a Hatchet, one on 
one Side, one on the other. I had another Belt 
not fo broad, and faftend in the fame Manner, 
which hung over my Shoulder ; and at the End of 
it, under my left Arm, hung two Pouches, both 
made of Goat's-Skin too; in one of which hung 
my Powder, in the other my Shot : At my Back I 
carry 'd my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and 
over my Head a great clumfy ugly Goat-Skin Um- 
brella, but which, after all, was the moft neceflary 
Thing I had about me, next to my Gun : As for 
my Face, the Colour of it was really not fo Moletta, 
like as one might expeft from a Man not at all care- 
ful of it, and living within nineteen Degrees of the 
Equinox. My Beard I had once fuffer'd to grow till 
it was about a Quarter of a Yard long ; but as I had 
both ScifTars and Razors fufficient, I had cut it pret- 
ty fhort, except what grew on my upper Lip, which I 
had trimm'd into a large Pair of Mahometan Whif- 
kers, fuch as I had feen worn by fome Turks, who I 
(aw at Sallee ; for the Moors did not wear fuch, tho' 
the Turks did ; of thefe Mufchatoes or Whiskers, I 
will not fay they were loug enough to hang my Hat 
upon them ; but they were of a Length and Shape 
monftrous enough, and fuch as in England would 
have pafs'd for frightful. 

But all this is by the by ; for as to my Figure, I 
had (b few to obferve me, that it was of no manner 
of Confequence ; fo I fay no more to that Part. In 
this kind of Figure I went my new Journey, and 
was out five or fix Days. I travelled firft along the 

N Sea 



[178] 



Sea Shore, dire&ly to the Place where I firft brought 
my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks ; 
and having no Boat now to take care of, I went o- 
ver the Land a nearer Way to the fame Height that 
I was upon before, when looking forward to the 
Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which I was 
oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is faid above : 
I was furpriz'd to fee the Sea all fmooth and quiet, 
no Ripling, no Motion, no Current, any more there 
than in other Places. 

I was at a ftrange Lofs to underftand this, and 
refolv'd to fpend fome Time in the obferving it, to 
fee if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occafi- 
on'd it ; but I was prefently convinc'd how it was, 
viz. That the Tide of Ebb fetting from the Weft, 
and joyning with the Current of Waters from fome 
great River on the Shore, muft be the Occafion of 
this Current ; and that according as the Wind blew 
more forcibly from the Weft, or from the Nortb y 
this Current came nearer, or went farther from the 
Shore ; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went 
up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb 
being made, I plainly faw the Current again as be- 
fore, only, that it run farther of, being near half a 
League from the Shore ; whereas in my Cafe, it 
fet clofe upon the Shore, and hurry 'd me and my 
Canoe along with it, which at another Time it 
would not have done. 

This Obfervation convinc'd me, That I had no- 
thing to do but to obferve the Ebbing and the 
Flowing of the Tide, and I might very eafily bring 
my Boat about the Ifland again : But when I be- 
gan to think of putting it in Practice, I had fuch a 
Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of 
the Danger I had been in, that I could not think 
of it again with any Patience ; but' on the contrary, 
I took up another Refolution which was more fafe, 

though 



C *79] 



though more laborious; and this was, That I 
would build, or rather make me another Periagau 
or Canoe ; and fo have one for one Side of the Ifland, 
and one for the other. 

You are to underftand, that now I had, as I 
may call it, two Plantations in the Ifland ; one my 
little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about 
it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me, 
which by this Time I had enlarg'd into feveral 
Apartments, or Caves, one within another. One 
of thefe, which was the dryeft, and largeft, and 
had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification ; 
that is to fay, beyond where my Wall joyn'd to 
the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen 
Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with 
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold 
five or fix Bufhels each, where I laid up my Stores 
of Provision, efpecially my Corn, fome in the Ear 
cut off fhort from the Straw, and the other rubb'd 
out with my Hand. 

As for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes 
or Piles, thofe Piles grew all like Trees, and were 
by this Time grown fo big, and fpread fo very 
much, that there ,was not the ieaft Appearance to 
any one's View of any Habitation behind them. 

Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther 
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my 
two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly 
cultivated and fow'd, and which duly yielded me 
their Harveft in its Seafon ; and whenever I had 
■occafion for more Corn, I had more Land adjoyn- 
ing as fit as that. 

Befides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had 
now a tollerable Plantation there alfo ; for firft, I 
had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept 
in Repair ; that, is to fay ', I kept the Hedge which 
circled it in, conftaritly fitted up to its ufual Height, 

N 2 the 



[i8o] 



the Ladder ftanding always in the Infide ; I kept 
the Trees which at firft were no more than my 
Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall ; I 
kept them always fo cut, that they might fpread and 
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable 
Shade, which they did eflfedtually to my Mind- 
In the Middle of this I had my Tent always (land- 
ing, being a piece of a Sail fpread over Poles fet 
up for that Purpofe, and which never wanted any 
Repair or Renewing ; and under this I had made 
me a Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Crea- 
tures I had kill'd, and with other foft Things, and 
a Blanket laid on them, fuch as belong'd to our 
Sea-Bedding, which I had faved, and a great 
Watch-Coat to cover me ; and here, whenever I 
had Occafion to be abfent from my chief Seat, I 
took up my Country Habitation. 

Adjoyning to this I had my Enclofures for my 
Cattle, that is to fay, my Goats : And as I had ta- 
ken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and en- 
clofe this Ground, fo I was fo uneafy to fee it kept 
entire, left the Goats fhould break thro', that I 
never left off till with infinite Labour I had ftuck 
the Out-fide of the Hedge fo full of fmall Stakes, 
and fo near to one another, that it was rather a 
Pale than a Hedge, and there was fcarce Room to 
put a Hand thro' between them, which afterwards 
when thofe Stakes grew, as they all did in the next 
rainy Seafon, made the Enclofure ftrong like a. 
Wall, indeed ftronger than any Wall. 

This will teftify fof- me that I was not idle,, 
and that I fpared no Pains to bring to pais what- 
ever appear'd neceflary for my comfortable Sup- 
port ; for I confider'd the keeping up a Breed of 
tame Creatures thus at my Hand, would be a li- 
ving Magazine of Flefh, Milk, Butter and Cheefe,, 

for 



[i8i] 



for me as long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be 
forty Years; and that keeping them in my Reach, 
depended entirely upon my perfe&ing my Enclo- 
fures to fuch a Degree, that I might be fure of 
keeping them together ; which by this Method in- 
deed I fo effectually fecur'd, that when thefe lit- 
tle Stakes began to grow, I had planted them fo 
very thick, I was forced to pull fome of them up 
again. 

In this Place alio I had my Grapes growing, 
which I principally depended on for my Winter 
Store of Raifins ; and which I never faiPd to pre- 
ferve very carefully, as the beft and moft agreeable 
Dainty of my whole Diet ; and indeed they were 
not agreeable only, but phyfical, wholefome, nou- 
rifhing, and refrefhing to the laft Degree. 

As this was alfo about half Way between my o- 
ther Habitation, and the Place where I had laid up 
my Boat, I generally ftay'd, and lay here in my 
Way thither; for I ufed frequently to vifit my 
Boat, and I kept all Things about or belonging to 
her in very good Order ; fometimes I went out 
in her to divert my felf, but no more hazardous 
Voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever above a 
Stone's Caft or two from the Shore, I was fo ap- 
prehenfive of being hurry'd out of my Knowledge 
again by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Ac- 
cident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life. 

It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards 
my Boat, I was exceedingly furpriz'd with the Print 
of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was\ 
very plain to be feen in the Sand : I ftood like one 
Thunder-ftruck, or as if I had feen an Apparition ; 
I liften'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing, 
nor fee any Thing, I went up to a rifing Ground to 
look farther, I went up the Shore and down the 
Shore, but it was all one, I could fee no other 

N 3 Impreflion 



[182] 



Impreflion but that one, I went to it again to fee 
if there were any more, and to obferve if it might 
not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for 
that, for there was exadly the very Print of a Foot, 
Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot ; how it 
came thither, I knew not, nor could in the leaft 
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, 
like a Man perfeftly confus'd and out of my felf, I 
came Home to my Fortification, not feeling, as we 
fay, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the laft 
Degree, looking behind me at every two or three 
Steps, miftaking every Bufh and Tree, and fancy- 
ing every Stump at a Diftance to be a Man ; nor is 
it poffible to defcribe how many various Shapes af- 
frighted Imagination reprefented Things to me in, 
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment 
in my Fancy, and what ftrange unaccountable 
Whimfies came into my Thoughts by the Way. 

When I came to my Caftle, for fo I think I calPd 
it ever after this, I fled into it like one purfued ; 
whether I went over by the Ladder as firft con- 
triv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which 
I call'd a Door, I cannot remember ; no, nor could 
I remember the next Morning, for never frighted 
Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more 
Terror of Mind than I to this Retreat, 

I flept none that Night ; the farther I was from 
the Occafion of my Fright, the greater my Ap^ 
prehenfions were, which is fomething contrary to 
the Nature of fuch Things, and efpecially to the u- 
fual Praftice of all Creatures in Fear : But I was 
fo embarrafs'd with my own frightful Ideas of the 
Thing, that I form'd nothing but difmal Imagina- 
tions to my felf, even tho' I was now a great way 
ofF of it. Sometimes I fancy 'd it muft be the De- 
vil ; and Reafon joyn'd in with me upon this Sup- 
pofition ; For how fhould any other Thing in hu- 
man 



C'8 3 ] 



man Shape come into the Place ? Where was the 
Veflel that brought them ? What Marks was there 
of any other Footfteps ? And how was it poflible 
a Man fhould come there ? But then to think that 
Satan fhould take human Shape upon him in fuch a 
Place where there could be no manner of Occafion 
for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind 
him, and that even for no Purpofe too, for he could 
not be fure I fhould fee it ; this was an Amufement 
the other Way ; I confider'd that the Devil might 
have found out abundance of other Ways to have 
terrify 'd me than this of the fingle Print of a Foot. 
That as I liv'd quite on the other Side of the Ifland, 
he would never have been fo fimple to leave a Mark 
in a Place where 'twas Ten Thoufand to one whe- 
ther I fhould ever fee it or not, and in the Sand 
too, which the firft Surge of the Sea upon a high 
Wind would have defac'd entirely : All this feem'd 
inconfiftent with the Thing it felf, and with all the 
Notions we ufually entertain of the Subtilty of the 
Devil. 

Abundance of fuch Things as thefe aflifted to ar- 
gue me out of all Apprehenfions of its being the 
Devil : And I prefently concluded then, that it muft 
be fbme more dangerous Creature, (viz.) That it 
muft be fbme of the Savages of the main Land 
over-againft me, who had wanderd out to Sea in 
their Canoes ; and either driven by the Currents, or 
by contrary Winds had made the Ifland ; and had 
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea, 
being as loth, perhaps, to have ftay'd in this defo- 
late Ifland, as I would have been to have had them. 

While thefe Refle&ions were rowling upon my 
Mind, I was very thankful in my Thoughts, that 
I was fb happy as not to be thereabouts at that 
Time, or that they did not fee my Boat, by which 
they would have concluded that fome Inhabitants 

N4 had 



[i8 4 ] 



had been in the Place, and perhaps have fearch'd 
farther for me : Then terrible Thoughts rack'd ray 
Imagination about their having found my Boat, 
and that there were People here ; and that if fb, I 
fhould certainly have them come again in greater 
Numbers, and devour me ; that if it fhould happen 
fo that they fhould not find me, yet they would 
find my Enclofure, deftroy all my Corn, carry a- 
way all my Flock of tame Goats, and I fhould pe- 
rifh at laft for meer Want 

Thus my Fear banifh'd all my religious Hope ; 
all that former Confidence in God which was 
founded upon fuch wonderful Experience as I had 
had of his Goodnefs, now vanifhed, as if he that 
had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not preferve 
by his Power the Provifion which he had made for 
me by his Goodnefs : I reproach'd my felf with my 
Eafinefs, that would not fow any more Corn one 
Year than would juft ferve me till the next Seafon, 
as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my 
enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground; 
and this I thought fo juft a Reproof, that I refolv'd 
for the future to have two or three Years Corn be- 
forehand, fb that whatever might come, I might 
not perifh for want of Bread. 

How ftrange a Chequer Work of Providence is 
the Life of Man! and by what fecret differing 
Springs are the Affeftions hurry'd about as differ- 
ing Circumftance prefent ! To Day we love what 
to Morrow we hate ; to Day we feek what to Mor- 
row we fhun ; to Day we defire what to Morrow 
we fear ; nay even tremble at the Apprehenfions of; 
this was exemplify'd in me at this Time in the 
moft lively Manner imaginable ; for I whofe only 
Affliftion was, that I feem'd banifhed from human 
| Society, that I was alone, circumfcrib'd by the 

; boundlefs Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and con- 

f demn'd 



[i«S] 



demn'd to what I call'd filent Life ; that I was as 
one who Heaven thought not worthy to be num- 
ber^ among the Living, or to appear among the 
reft of his Creatures ; that to have feen one of my 
own Species, would have feem'd to me a Raifing 
me from Death to Life, and the greateft Bleffing 
that Heaven it felf, next to the fupreme Bleffing of 
Salvation, could beftow; I fay, that I fhould now 
tremble at the very Apprehenfions of feeing a Man, 
and was ready to fink into the Ground at but the 
Shadow or filent Appearance of a Man's having fet 
his Foot in the Ifland. 

Such is the uneven State of human Life : And it 
afforded me a great many curious Speculations af- 
terwards, when I had a little recover 'd my firft 
Surprize ; I confider'd that this was the Station of 
Life the infinitely wife and good Providence of 
God had determin'd for me, that as I could not 
forefee what the Ends of Divine Wifdom might be 
in all this, fo I was not to difpute his Sovereignty, 
who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted 
Right by Creation to govern and difpofe of me ab- 
folutely as he thought fit; and who, as I was a 
Creature who had offended him, had likewife a ju- 
dicial Right to condemn me to what Punifhment 
he thought fit ; and that it was my Part to fubmit 
to bear his Indignation, becaufe I had finn'd againft 
him. 

I then reflefted that God, who was not only 
Righteous but Omnipotent, as he had thought 
fit thus to punifh and afflidfc me, fo he was 
able to deliver me; that if he did not think 
fit to do it, 'twas my unqueftion'd Duty to 
refign my felf abfolutely and entirely to his Will ; 
and on the other Hand, it was my Duty alfo to 
hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the 
Di&ates and Directions of his daily Providence. 

Thefe 



[i86] 



Thefe Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days ; 
nay, I may fay, Weeks and Months ; and one par- 
ticular Efleft of my Cogitations on this Occafion, 
I cannot omit, viz. One Morning early, lying in 
my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger 
from the Appearance of Savages, I found it dif- 
compos'd me very much, upon which thofe Words 
of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call upon 
me in the Day of Trouble, and 1 will deliver ', and thou 
/halt glorify me. 

Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my Bed, my 
Heart was not only comforted, but I was guided 
and encourag'd to pray earneftly to God for Deli- 
verance : When I had done praying, I took up my 
Bible, and opening it to read, the firft Words that 
prefented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and be of 
good Cheer, and he Jhall Jlrengthen thy Heart ; wait, 1 
fay, on the Lord: It is impoffible to exprefs the Com- 
fort this gave me. In Anfwer, I thankfully laid 
down the Book, and was no more fad, at leaft > 
not on that Occafion. 

In the middle of thefe Cogitations, Apprehenfi- 
ons and Reflections, it came into my Thought one 
Day, that all this might be a meer Chimera of my 
own ; and that this Foot might be the Print of my 
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat : 
This chear'd me up a little too, and I began to per- 
fwade my felf it was all a Delufion ; that it was no- 
thing elfe but my own Foot, and why might not I 
come that way from the Boat, as well as I was go- 
ing that way to the Boat ; again, I confider'd alfo 
that I could by no Means tell for certain where I 
had trod, and where I had not ; and that if at laft 
this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had 
play'd the Part of thofe Fools, who ftrive to make 
ftories of Speftres, and Apparitions ; and then are 
frighted at them more than any body. 

Now 



[i*7] 



Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad 
again ; for I had not ftirr'd out of my Caftle for three 
Days and Nights ; fo that I began to ftarve for 
Provifion ; for I had little or nothing within Doors, 
but fome Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew 
that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which u- 
fually was my Evening Diverfion ; and the poor 
Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for 
want of it ; and indeed, it almoft fpoil'd fome of 
them, and almoft dry'd up their Milk. 

Heartning my felf therefore with the Belief that 
this was nothing but the Print of one of my own 
Feeet, and fo I might be truly faid to ftart at my 
own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and 
went to my Country Houfe, to milk my Flock ; but 
to fee with what Fear I went forward, how often I 
look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and 
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it 
would have made any one have thought I was haunt- 
ed with an evil Confidence, or that I had been late- 
ly mod terribly frighted, and fo indeed I had. 

However, as I went down thus two or three 
Days, and having feen nothing, I began to be a lit- 
tle bolder ; and to think there was really nothing in 
it, but my own Imagination : But I cou'd not per- 
fwade my felf fully of this, till I ihould go down to 
the Shore again, and fee this Print of a Foot, and 
meafure it by my own, and fee if there was any Si- 
militude or Fitnefs, that I might be affur'd it was 
my own Foot: But when I came to the Place, 
Firjf 9 It appear'd evidently to me, that when I laid 
up my Boat, I could not poffibly be on Shore any 
where there about. Secondly , When I came to mea- 
fure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot 
not fo large by a great deal ; both thefe Things fill'd 
my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the 
Vapours again, to the higheft Degree; fo that I 

fhook 



[i88] 



fhook with cold, like one in an Ague : And I went 
Home again, filTd with the Belief that fome Man 
or Men had been on Shore there ; or in fhort, that the 
lfland was inhabited, and I might be furpriz'd be- 
fore I was aware ; and what courfe to take for my 
Security I knew not. 

O what ridiculous Refolution Men take, when 
poflefs'd with Fear ! It deprives them of the Ufe of 
thofe Means which Reafon offers for their Relief. 
The firft Thing I propos'd to my felf, was, to 
throw down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame 
Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might 
not find them ; and then frequent the lfland in Prof- 
pe& of the fame, or the like Booty : Then to the 
fimple Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields, 
that they might not find fuch a Grain there, and 
ftill be prompted to frequent the lfland ; then to de- 
molifti my Bower, and Tent, that they might not 
fee any Veftiges of Habitation, and be prompted to 
look farther, in order to find out the Perfons in- 
habiting. 

Thefe were the Subjed of the firft Night's Cogi- 
tation, after I was come Home again, while the 
Apprehenfions which had fo over-run my Mind 
were frefh upon me, and my Head was full of Va- 
pours, as above : Thus Fear of Danger is ten thou- 
fand Times more terrifying than Danger it felf, 
when apparent to the Eyes ; and we find the Bur- 
then of Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil 
which we are anxious about ; and which was worfe 
than all this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble 
from the Refignation I ufed to praftife, that I 
hop'd to have. I look'd, I thought, like Saul, who 
complain'd not only that the Pbiliftines were upon 
him ; but that God had forfaken him ; for I did not 
now take due Ways to compbfe my Mind, by crying 
to God in my Diftrefs, and refting upon his Provi- 
dence, 



[i8 9 ] 



dence, as I had done before, for my Defence and 
Deliverance ; which if I had done, I had, at leaft, 
been more cheerfully fupported under this new Sur- 
prife, and perhaps carry *d through it with more 
Refolution. 

This Confufion of my Thoughts kept me waking 
all Night ; but in the Morning I fell afleep, and 
having by the Amufement of my Mind, been, as it 
were, tyr'd, and my Spirits exhaufted ; I flept ve- 
ry foundly, and wak'd much better compos'd than 
I had ever been before ; and now I began to think 
fedately; and upon the utmoft Debate with my 
felf, I concluded, That this Ifland, which was fo 
exceeding pleafant, fruitful, and no farther from 
the main Land than as I had feen, was not fo en- 
tirely abandon'd as I might imagine : That altho' 
there were no ftated Inhabitants who liv'd on the 
Spot ; yet that there might fometimes come Boats 
off from the Shore, who either with Defign, or 
perhaps never, but when they were driven by crofs 
Winds, might come to this Place. 

That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had 
not met with the leaft Shadow or Figure of any 
People yet ; and that if at any Time they ihould be 
driven here, it was probable they went away again 
as foon as ever they could, feeing they had never 
thought fit to fix there upon any Occafion, to 
this Time. 

That the moft I cou'd fuggeft any Danger from, 
was, from any fuch cafual accidental Landing of 
ftraggling People from the Main, who, as it was 
likely if they were driven hither, were here againft 
their Wills ; fb they made no ftay here, but went off 
again with all poffible Speed, feldom (laying one 
Night on Shore, leaft they ihould not have the 
Help of the Tides, and Day-light back again ; and 
that therefore I had nothing to do but to confider 

of 



C *9°] 



of fome fafe Retreat, in Cafe I (hould fee any Sa- 
vages land upon the Spot. 

Now I began forely to repent, that I had dug 
my Cave fo large, as to bring a Door through a- 
gain, which Door, as I faid, came out beyond 
where my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock ; upon 
maturely confidering this therefore, I refolv'd to 
draw me a fecond Fortification, in the fame Man- 
ner of a Semicircle, at a Diftance from my Wall 
juft where I had planted a double Row of Trees, 
about twelve Years before, of which I made men- 
tion : Thefe Trees having been planted fo thick 
before, they wanted but a few Piles to be driven 
between them, that they fh ould be thicker, and 
ftronger, and my Wall would be foon finifti'd. 

So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer 
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Ca- 
bles, and every Thing I could think of, to make it 
ftrong ; having in it feven little Holes, about as 
big as I might put my Arm out at : In the In-fide 
of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot 
thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my 
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and 
walking upon it ; and through the feven Holes, I 
contriv'd to plant the Mufquets, of which I took 
Notice, that I got feven on Shore out of the Ship ; 
thefe, I fay, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted 
them into Frames that held them like a Carriage, 
that fo I could fire all the feven Guns in two Mi- 
nutes Time : This Wall I was many a weary Month 
a finifhing, and yet never thought my felf fafe till it 
was done. 

When this was done, I ftuck all the Ground 
without my Wall, for a great way every way, as 
full with Stakes or Sticks of the Ofier like Wood, 
which I found fo apt to grow, as they could well 
ftand ; infomuch, that I believe I might fet in near 

twenty 



C»9i] 



twenty thoufand of them; leaving a pretty large 
Space between them and my Wall, that I might 
have room to fee an Enemy, and they might have 
no (helter from the young Trees, if they attempted 
to approach my outer Wall. 

Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove 
and in five or fix Years Time I had a Wood before 
my Dwelling, growing fo monftrous thick and 
ftrong, that it was indeed perfectly impaflable; 
and no Men of what kind foever, would ever ima- 
gine that there was any Thing beyond it, much lefs 
a Habitation : As for the Way which I propos'd to 
my felf to go in and out, for I left no Avenue ; it 
was by fetting two Ladders, one to a Part of the 
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left 
room to place another Ladder upon that ; fo when 
the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living 
could come down to me without mifchieving him- 
felf ; and if they had come down, they were ftill on 
the Out-fide of my outer Wall. 

Thus I took all the Meafures humane Prudence 
could fuggeft for my own Prefervation ; and it will 
be feen at length, that they were not altogether 
without juft Reafon ; though I forefaw nothing at 
that Time, more than my meer Fear fuggefted 
to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether Care- 
lefs of my other Affairs ; for I had a great Concern 
upon me, for my little Herd of Goats ; they were 
not only a prefent Supply to me upon every Occa- 
fion, and began to be fufficient to me, without the 
Expence of Powder and Shot ; but alfo without the 
Fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones, and I was 
loth to lofe the Advantage of them, and to have 
them all to nurfe up over again. 

To this Purpofe, after long Confideration, I 
could think of but two Ways to preferve them ; 

one 



[l 9 2] 



one was to find another convenient Place to dig a 
a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it 
every Night ; and the other was to enclofe two or 
three little Bits of Land, remote from one another 
and as much conceal'd as I could, where I might 
keep about half a Dozen young Goats in each 
Place : So that if any Difafter happened to the 
Flock in general, I might be able to raife them a- 
gain with little Trouble and Time : And this, tho' 
it would require a great deal of Time and La- 
bour, I thought was the moft rational Defign. 

Accordingly I {pent fome Time to find out the 
moft retir'd Parts of the Ifland ; and I pitch'd up- 
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart 
could wi(h for ; it was a little damp Piece of Ground 
in the Middle of the hollow and thick Woods,, 
where, as is obferv'd, I almoft loft my felf once be- 
fore, endeavouring to come back that Way from 
the Eaftern Part of the Ifland : Here I found a 
clear Piece of Land near three Acres, fo furround- 
ed with Woods, that it was almoft an Enclofure by 
Nature, at leaft it did not want near fo much La- 
bour to make it fo, as the other Pieces of Ground 
I had work'd fo hard at< 

I immediately went to Work with this Piece of 
Ground, and in lefs than a Month's Time, I had 
fo fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it 
which you pleafe, who were not fo wild now as at 
firft they might be fuppofed to be, were well e- 
nough fecur'd in it. So, without any farther De- 
lay, I removed ten young She-Goats and two He- 
Goats to this Piece ; and when they were there, I 
continued to perfeft the Fence till I had made it 
as fecure as the other, which, however, I did at 
more Leifure, and it took me up more Time by a 
great deal. 

All 



[ x 93 ] 



All this Labour I was at the Expence of, purely 
from my Apprehenfions on the Account of the Print 
of a Mans Foot which I had feen ; for as yet I 
never (aw any human Creature come near the Ifland, 
and I had now liv'd two Years under thefe Unea- 
finefles, which indeed made my Life much lefs 
comfortable than it was before; as may well be 
imagin'd by any who know what it is to live in 
the conftant Snare of the Fear of Man ; and this I 
muft obferve with Grief too, that the Difcompo- 
fure of my Mind had too great impreffions alfo up- 
on the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the 
Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Sa- 
vages and Canibals, lay fo upon my Spirits, that 
I teldom found my felf in a due Temper for appli- 
cation to my Maker, at leaft not with the fedate 
Calmnefs and Refignation of Soul which I was 
wont to do; I rather pray'd to God as under 
great Affli&ion and Preflure of Mind, furrounded 
with Danger, and in Expe&ation every Night of 
being murther'd and devour'd before Morning; 
and I muft teftify from my Experience, that a Tem- 
per of Peace, Thankfulness, Love and AfFe&ion, is 
much more the proper Frame for Prayer than that 
of Terror and Difcompofure ; and that under the 
Dread of Mifchief impending, a Man is no more 
fit for a comforting Performance of the Duty of 
praying to God, than he is for Repentance on a 
fick Bed : For thefe Difcompofures afFeft the Mind 
as the others do the Body ; and the Difcompofure 
of the Mind muft neceflarily be as great a Difabili- 
ty as that of the Body, and much greater, Praying 
to God being properly an Ad of the Mind, not of 
the Body. 

But to go on ; After I had thus fecur'd one Part 
of my little living Stock, I went about the whole 
Ifland, fearching for another private Place, to make 

O fuch 



C J 94] 



fuch another Depofit; when wandring more to the 
Weft Point of the Ifland, than I had ever gone yet, 
and looking out to Sea, I thought I faw a Boat up- 
on the Sea, at a great Diftance ; I had found a Pro- 
fpe&ive Glafs, or two, in one of the Seamen's 
Chefts, which I fav'd out of our Ship ; but I had it 
not about me, and this was fo remote, that I could 
not tell what to make of it ; though I look'd at it 
till my eyes were not able to hold to look any 
longer ; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not 
know ; but as I defcended from the Hill, I could 
fee no more of it, fo I gave it over ; only I refolv'd 
to go no more out without a Profpeftive Glafs in 
my Pocket. 

When I was come down the Hill, to the End of 
the Ifland, where indeed I had never been before, 
I was presently convinc'd, that the feeing the Print 
of a Man's Foot, was not fuch a ftrange Thing in 
the Ifland as I imagined ; and but that it was a fpe- 
■cial Providence that I was caft upon the Side of the 
Ifland, where the Savages never came : I ihould ea- 
sily have known, that nothing was more frequent 
than for the Canoes from the Main, when they hap- 
pen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to ftioot over 
to that Side of the Ifland for Harbour ; likewife as 
they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Vi- 
gors having taken any Prifoners, would bring them 
over to this Shore, where according to their dread- 
ful Cuftoms, being all Caniials, they would kill and 
eat them ; of which hereafter. 

When I was come down the Hill, to the Shore, 
as I faid above, being the S. W. Point of the I- 
fland, I was perfectly confounded and amaz'd ; nor 
\ is it poflible for me to exprefs the Horror of my 
Mind, at feeing the Shore fpread with Skulls, 
Hands, Feet, and other Bones of humane Bodies ; 
and particularly I obferv'd a Place where there had 

been 



[ *95 ] 



fceen a Fire made, and a Circle dug in the Earth, 
like a Cockpit, where it is fuppos'd the Savage 
Wretches had fat down to their inhumane Feaft- 
ings upon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures. 

I was fo aftonifh'd with the Sight of thefe Things, 
that I entertain'd no Notions of any Danger to my 
•felf from it for a long while ; AH my Apprehenfions 
were bury'd in the Thoughts of fuch a Pitch of in- 
human, hellifh Brutality, and the Horror of the De- 
generacy of Humane Nature ; which though I had 
heard of often, yet I never had fo near a View of 
before ; in ihort, I turn'd away my Face from the 
horrid SpeAacle ; my Stomach grew fick, and I was 
juft at the Point of Fainting, when Nature dif- 
charg'd the Diforder from my Stomach ; and ha- 
ving vomited with an uncommon Violence, I was 
a little reliev'd ; but cou'd not bear to ftay in the 
Place a Moment ; fo I gat me up the Hill again, 
with all the Speed I cou'd, and walk'd on towards 
my own Habitation. 

When I came a little out of that Part of the I- 
fland, I flood ftill a while as amaz'd ; and then re- 
covering my fel£ I looked up with the utmoft Aflfe- 
<ftion of my Soul, and with a Flood of Tears in my 
Eyes, gave God Thanks that had caft my firft Lot in 
.a Part of the World, where I was diftinguifh'd 
from fuch dreadful Creatures as thefe ; and that 
though I had efteem'd my prefent Condition very 
miferable, had yet given me fo many Comforts in 
it % that I had ftill more to give Thanks for than to 
complain of; and this above all, that I had even 
in this miferable Condition been comforted with 
the Knowledge of himfelf, and the Hope of his 
Blefling, which was a Felicity more than fufficient- 
ly equivalent to all the Mifery which I had fuffer'd, 
or could fuffer. 

O 2 In 



[ i 9 6 ] 

In this Frame of Thankfulnef , I went Home ta 
my Caftle, and began to be much eafier now, as 
to the Safety of my Circumftances, than ever I was 
before; for I obferv'd, that thefe Wretches never 
came to this Ifland in fearch of what they could 
get ; perhaps not feeking, not wanting, or not ex- 
pecting any Thing here ; and having often, no doubt,, 
been up in the cover'd woody Part of it, without 
finding any Thing to their Purpofe. I knew I had 
been here now almoft eighteen Years, and never 
faw the leaft Foot-fteps of Humane Creature there 
before ; and I might be here eighteen more, as en- 
tirely conceaTd as I was now, if I did not difcover 
my felf to them, which I had no manner of Occa- 
fion to do, it being my only Bufinefs to keep my 
felf entirely conceal'd where I was, unlefs I found 
a better fort of Creatures than Canibals to make my 
felf known to. 

Yetl entertain'd fuch an Abhorrence of the Savage 
Wretches, that I have been fpeaking of, and of 
the wretched inhuman Cuftom of their devouring 
and eating one another up, that I continu'd penfive,, 
and fad, and kept clofe within my own Circle 
for almoft two Years after this : When I fay my 
own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plantations,, 
viz. my Caftle, my Country Seat, which I call'd 
my Bower, and my Enclofure in the Woods ; nor 
did I look after this for any other Ufe than as an 
Enclofure for my Goats ; for the Averfion which 
Nature gave me to thefe hellifh Wretches, was 
fuch, that I was fearful of feeing them, as of feeing 
the Devil himfelf ; nor did I fo much as go to look 
after my Boat, in all this Time ; but began rather 
to think of making me another ; for I cou'd not 
think of ever making any more Attempts, to bring 
the other Boat round the Ifland to me, leaft I 
fliould meet with fome of thefe Creatures at Sea, 

in 



['97] 



in which, if I had happen'd to have fallen into their 
Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot. 

Time however, and the Satisfa&ion I had, that 
I was in no Danger of being difcover'd by thefe 
People, began to wear off my Uneafinefs about 
them ; and I began to live juft in the fame compos'd 
Manner as before ; only with this Difference, that 
I ufed more Caution, and kept my Eyes more a- 
bout me than I did before, leaft I ftiould happen to 
be feen by any of them ; and particularly, I was 
more cautious of firing my Gun, leaft any of them 
being on the Ifland, fhould happen to hear of it : 
and it was therefore a very good Pravidence to me, 
that I had furnifh'd my feif with a tame Breed of 
<5oats, that I needed not hunt any more about the 
Woods, or (hoot at them ; and if I did catch any 
of them after this, it was by Traps, and Snares, as 
I had done before ; fo that for two years after this, 
I believe I never fir'd my Gun once of, though I 
never went out without it ; and which was more, 
as I had fav'd three Piftols out of the Ship, I al- 
ways carry'd them out with me, or at leaft two of 
them, flicking them in my Goat-fkin Belt ; alfo I 
furbifli'd up one of the great Cutlafhes, that I had 
out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on 
alfo ; fo that I was now a moft formidable Fellow i 
to look at, when I went abroad, if you add to / 
the former Defcription of my felf, the Particular of 
two Piftols, and a great broad Sword, hanging at 
my Side in a Belt, but without a Scabbard. 

Things going on thus, as I have faid, for fome 
Time ; I feem'd, excepting thefe Cautions, to be 
reduc'd to my former calm, fedate Way of Living, 
all thefe Things tended to (hewing me more and 
more how far my Condition was from being mife- 
rable, compar'd to fome others ; nay, to many o- 
.ther Particulars of Life, which it might have plea- 
ch 3 fed 



[i 9 8] 



fed, God to have made my Lot. It put me upon* 
refle&ing, How little repining there would be a- 
mong Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if Peo- 
ple would rather compare their Condition with, 
thofe that are worfe, in order to be thankful, than 
be always comparing them with thofe which are- 
better, to aflift their Murmurings and Complain- 
ings. 

As in my prefent Condition there were not really 
many Things which I wanted ; fo indeed I thought 
that the Frights I had been in about thefe Savage 
Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for my 
own Prefervation, had taken off the Edge of my In- 
vention for my own Conveniences ; and I had dropp'd- 
a good Defign, which I had once bent my Thoughts 
too much upon ; and that was, to try if I cpuld not 
make fome of my Barley into Malt, and they try 
to brew my felf fome Beer : This was really a whim- 
fical Thought, and I reprov'd my felf often for the 
Simplicity of it ; for I prefently faw there would 
be the want of feveral Things necefTary to the 
making my Beer, that it would be impoffible for 
me to fupply; as Firft, Casks to'preferve it in, 
which was a Thing, that as I have obferv'd alrea- 
dy, I cou'd never compafs ; no, though I fpent not 
many Days, but Weeks, nay, Months in attempt- 
ing it, but to no purpofe. In the next Place, I had 
no Hops to make it keep, no Yeaft to make it work* 
no Copper or Kettle to make it boil ; and yet all 
thefe Things, notwithftanding, I verily believe,, 
had not thefe Things interven'd, I mean the Frights, 
and Terrors I was in about the Savages, I had un- 
dertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pafs too ; for 
I feldom gave any Thing over without accomplifh- 
ing it, when I once had it in my Head enough, 
to begin it. 

But 



[ x 99] 



But my Invention now run quite another Way ; 
for Night and Day, I could think of nothing but 
how I might deftroy fome of thefe Monfters in their 
cruel bloody Entertainment, and if poffible, fave 
the Viftim they fhould bring hither to deftroy. It 
would take up a larger Volume than this whole 
Work is intended to be, to fet down all the Con- 
trivances I hatch'd, or rather brooded upon in my 
Thought, for the deftroying thefe Creatures, or at 
leaft frighting them, fo as to prevent their coming 
hither any more; but all was abortive, nothing 
could be poffible to take efFeft, unlefs I was to be 
there to do it my felf ; and what could one Man 
do among them, when perhaps there might be 
twenty or thirty of them together, with their 
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which 
they could fhoot as true to a Mark, as I could with 
my Gun ? 

Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the 
Place where they made their Fire, and put • in five 
or fix Pound of Gun-Powder, which when they 
kindled their Fire, would consequently take Fire, 
and blow up all that was near it : but as in the firft 
Place I fhould be very loth to waft fo much Powder 
upon them, my Store being now within the Quan- 
tity of one Barrel ; fo neither could I be fure of its 
going off, at any certain Time; when it might fur- 
prife them, and at beft, that it would do little more 
than juft blow the Fire about their Ears and f/ight 
them, but not fufficient to make them forfake the 
Place ; fo I laid it afide, and then propos'd, that 
I would place my felf in Ambufh, in fome con- 
venient Place, with my three Guns, all double 
loaded ; and in the middle of their bloody Cere- 
" mony, let fly at them, when I fhould be fure to kill 
or wound perhaps two or three at every fhoot ; and 
then falling in upon them with my three Piftols, 

O 4 and 



[ 200 ] 



and my Sword, I made no doubt, but that if there was 
twenty I fhould kill them all : This Fancy pleas'd my 
Thoughts for fome Weeks, and I was fo full of it, that 
I often dream'd of it ; ' and fometimes that I was juft 
going to let fly at them in my Sleep. 

I went fo far with it in my Imagination, that I 
employ 'd my felf feveral Days to find out proper 
Places to put my felf in Ambufcade, as I faid, to 
watch for them ; and I went frequently to the Place 
it felf, which was now grown more familiar to 
me ; and elpecially while my Mind was thus fill'd 
with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody put- 
ting twenty dr thirty of them to the Sword, as I 
may call it ; the Horror I had at the Place, and 
at the Signals of the barbarous Wretches devour- 
ing one another, abated my Malice. 

Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of 
the Hill, where I was fatisfy'd I might fecurely 
wait, till I faw any of their Boats coming, and 
might then, even before they would be ready to 
come on Shore, convey my felf unfeen into Thickets 
of Trees, in one of which there was a Hollow 
large enough to conceal me entirely ; and were I 
might fit, and obferve all their bloody Doings, and 
take my full aim at their Heads, when they were 
fo clofe together, as that it would be next to im- 
poflible that I fhould mifs my Shoot, or that I could 
fail wounding three or four of them at the firft 
Shoot. 

* 

In this Place then I refolv'd to fix my Defign, 
and accordingly I prepar'd two Muskets, and my 
ordinary Fowling Piece. The two Muskets ! 
loaded with a Brace of Slugs each, and four or five 
fmaller Bullets, about the Size of Piftol Bullets ; 
and the Fowling Piece I loaded with near a Hand- 
ful of Swan-fhot, of the largeft Size ; I alfo loaded 
my Piftols with* about four Bullets each, and in this 

Pofture, 



[ 2QI ] 



Pofture, well provided with Ammunition for a fe- 
cond and third Charge, I prepar'd my felf for my 
Expedition.* 

After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Defign, 
and in my Imagination put it in Praftice, I conti- 
nually made my Tour every Morning up to the 
Top of the HU1, which was from my Caftle, as I 
call'd it, about three Miles, or more, to fee if I 
cou'd obferve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near 
the Ifland, or (landing over towards it ; but I be- 
gan to tire of this hard Duty ; after I had for two 
or three Months conftantly kept my Watch ; but 
came always back without any Difcovery, there 
having not in all that Time been the leaft Appear- 
ance, not only on, or near the Shore ; but not on 
the Whole Ocean, fo far as my Eyes or Glafles 
could reach every Way. 

As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill, 
to look out ; fo long alfo I kept up the Vigour of 
my Defign, and my Spirits feem'd to be all the 
while in a fuitable Form, for fo outragious an Exe- 
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages, 
for an Offence which I had not at all entred into a 
Difcuflion of in my Thoughts, any farther than my 
Paflions were at firft fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd 
at the unnatural Cuftom of that People of the Coun- 
try, who it feems had been fuffer'd by Providence 
in his wife Difpofition of the World, to have no o- 
ther Guide than that of their own abominable and 
vitiated Paflions ; and confequently were left, and 
perhaps had been fo for fome Ages, to aft fuch 
horrid Things, and receive fuch dreadful Cu- 
ftoms, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon cl 
of Heaven, and afted by fome hellifh Degeneracy, 
could have run them into : But now, when as I 
have faid, I began to be weary of the fruitlefs Ex- 
cur fion, which I had made fo long, and fo far, eve- 
ry 



[ 202 ] 



ry Morning in vain, fo my Opinion of the A&ion 
it felf began to alter, arid I began with cooler and 
calmer Thoughts to conficter what it was I was go- 
ing to engage in. What Authority, or Call I had,, 
to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon thefe 
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit 
for fo many Ages to fufler unpunifh'd, to go on,, 
and to be as it were, the Executioners of his Judg- 
ments one upon another. How far thefe People 
were Offenders againft me, and what Right I had 
to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they 
Hied promifcuoufly one upon another. I debated 
this very often with my felf thus ; How do I know 
what God himfelf judges in this particular Cafe ; it 
is certain thefe People either do not commit this as- 
a Crime; it is not againft their own Confidences 
reproving, or their Light reproaching them. They 
do not know it be an Offence, and then commit 
it in Defiance of Divine Juftice, as we do in almoft 
all the Sins we commit, They think it no more a 
Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we da 
to kill an Ox ; nor to eat humane Flefh, than we 
do to eat Mutton. 

When I had confider'd this a little, it follow'd 
necefTarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in 
it, that thefe People were not Murtherers' in the 
Senfe that I had before condemn'd them, in my 
Thoughs; any more than thofe Chriftians were 
Murtherers, who often put to Death the Prifoners 
taken in Battle ; or more frequently, upon many 
Occafions, put whole Troops of Men to the Sword,, 
without giving Quarter, though they threw down 
their Arms and fubmitted. 

In the next Place it occurr'd to me, that albeit the 
Ufage they thus gave one another, was thus brutifh 
and inhuman ; yet it was really nothing to me : 
Thefe People had done me no Injury. That if they 

attempted 



[ *°3 .] 



attempted me, or I few it neceflary for my imme- 
diate Prefervation to fall upon them, fomething 
might be (aid for it ; but that as I was yet out of 
their Power, and they had really no Knowledge 
me, and confequently no Defign upon me ; and 
therefore it could not be juft for me to fall upon 
them. That this would juftify the Conduct of the 
Spaniards in all their Barbarities pra&is'd in Ame- 
rica, and where they deftroy'd Millions of thefe 
People, who however they were Idolaters and Bar- 
barians, and had feveral bloody and barbarous 
Rites in their Cuftoms, fuch as facrificing human 
Bodies to their Idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards^ 
very innocent People ; and that the rooting them 
out of the Country, is fpoken of with the utmoft 
Abhorrence and Deteftation, by even the Spaniards 
themfelves, at this Time ; and by all other Chrifti- 
an Nations of Europe, as a meer Butchery, a bloo- 
dy and unnatural Piece of Cruelty, unjuftifiable ei- 
ther to God or Man ; and fuch, as for which the ve- 
ry Name of a Spaniard is reckon'd to be frightful 
and terrible to all People of Humanity, or of Chri- 
ftian Compaflion : As if the Kingdom of Spain were 
particularly Eminent for the Produft of a Race of 
Men, who were without Principles of Tendernefe, 
or the common Bowels of Pity to the Miferable, 
which is reckon'd to be a Mark of generous Tem- 
per in the Mind. 

Thefe Considerations really put me to a Paufe,. 
and to a kind of a Full-ftop ; and I began by little 
and little to be off of my Defign, and to conclude,. 
I had taken wrong Meafures in my Refolutions to 
attack the Savages ; that it was not my Bufinefs to 
meddle with them, unlefs they firft attack'd me, 
and this it was my Bufinefs if poflible to prevent - y 
but that if I were difcover'd, and attack'd, then I 
knew my Duty. 

On 



[ *°4] 



On the other hand, I argu'd with my felf, That 
this really was the way not to deliver my felf, but 
entirely to ruin and deftroy my (elf; for unlefs I was 
fure to kill every one that not only fhould be on 
Shore at that Time, but that fhould ever come on 
Shore afterwards, if but one of them efcap'd, to 
tell their Country People what had happen'd, they 
would come over again by Thoufands to re- 
venge the Death of their Fellows, and I fhould 
only bring upon my felf a certain Deftruftion, 
which at prefent I had no manner of occafi- 
on for. 

Upon the whole I concluded, That neither in 
Principle or in Policy, I ought one way or other to 
concern my felf in this Affair. That my Bufinefs 
was by all poflible Means to conceal my felf from 
them, and not to leave the leaft Signal to them to 
guefs by, that there were any living Creatures up- 
on the Ifland ; I mean of humane Shape. 

Religion joyn'd in with this Prudential, and I 
was convinc'd now many Ways, that I was per- 
fectly out of my Duty, when I was laying all my 
bloody Schemes for the Deftruftion of innocent 
Creatures, I mean innocent as to me : As to the 
Crimes they were guilty of towards one another, 
I had nothing to do with them ; they were Nati- 
onal, and I ought to leave them to the Juftice of 
God, who is the Governour of Nations, and 
knows how by National Puniftunents to make a juft 
Retribution for National Offences; and to bring 
publick Judgments upon thofe who offend in a pub- 
lick Manner, by fuch Ways as beft pleafes him. 

This appear'd fo clear tp me now, that nothing 
was a greater Satisfaction to me, than that I had 
not been fuffer'd to do a Thing which I now faw 
fo much Reafon to believe would have been no lefs 
a Sin, than that of wilful Murther, if I had com- 
mitted 



[ 2 °5 ] 



mitted it ; and I gave moft humble Thanks on my 
Knees to God, that had thus deliver'd me froqj 
Blood- Guiltinefs; befeeching him to grant me the 
Prote&ion of his Providence, that I might not fall 
into the Hands of the Barbarians ; or that I might 
not lay my Hands upon them, unlefe I had a more 
clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my 
own Life. 

In this Difpofition I continu'd, for near a Year 
after this ; and fo far was I from defiring an Oc- 
cafion for falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all 
that Time, I never once went up the Hill to fee 
whether there were any of them in Sight, or to 
know whether any of them had been on Shore 
there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re- 
new any of my Contrivances againft them, or be 
provok'd by any Advantage which might prefent it 
felf, to fall upon them ; only this I did, I went and 
remov'd my Boat, which I had on the other Side 
the Ifland, and carry'd it down to the Eaft End of 
the whole Ifland, where I ran it into a little Cove 
which I found under fome high Rocks, and where* 
I knew, by Reafon of the Currents, the Savages 
durft not, at leaft would not come with their Boats, 
upon any Account whatfoever. 

With my Boat I carry'd away every Thing that 
I had left there belonging to her, though not ne- 
ceffary for the bare going thither, viz. A Maft 
and Sail which I had made for her, and a Thing 
like an Anchor, but indeed which could not be 
calPd either Anchor or Grapling ; however, it was 
the beft I could make of its kind : All thefe I re- 
mov'd, that there might not be the leaft Shadow 
of any Difcovery, or any Appearance of any Boat, 
or of any human Habitation upon the Ifland. 

Befides this, I kept my felf, as I faid, more re- 
tired than ever, and feldom went from my Cell, o- 

ther 



[ao6] 



ther than upon my conftant Employment, viz. To 
ipilk my She-goats, and manage my little Flock, in 
the Wood ; which as it was quite on the other Part 
of the Ifland, was quite out of Danger ; for certain 
it is, that thefe Savage People who fometimes 
haunted this Ifland, never came with any Thoughts 
of finding any Thing here ; and confequently never 
wandred off from the Coaft ; and I doubt not, but 
they might have been feveral Times on Shore, after 
my Apprehenfions of them had made me cautious as 
well as before; and indeed, I look'd back with 
fome Horror upon the Thoughts of what my Con- 
dition would have been, if I had chop'd upon them, 
and been difcover'd before that, when naked and 
unarm'd, except with one Gun, and that loaden of- 
ten only with fmall Shot, I walk'd every where 
peeping, and peeping about the Ifland, to fee what 
I could get ; what a Surprife fhould I have been in, 
if when I difcover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I 
had inftead of that, km fifteen or twenty Savages, 
and found them purfuing me, and by the Swiftnefs 
•of their Running, no Poflibility of my efcaping 
them. 

The Thoughts of this fometimes funk my very 
Soul within me, and diftrefs'd my Mind fo much, 
that I could not fbon recover it, to think what I 
fhould have done, and how I not only fhould not 
have been able to refift them, but even fhould not 
have had Prefence of Mind enough to do what I 
might have done ; much lefs, what now after fo 
much Confideration and Preparation I might be a- 
ble to do : Indeed, after ferious thinking of thefe 
Things, I fhould be very Melancholly ; and fome- 
times it would laft a great while ; but I refolv'd it 
at laft all into Thankfulnefs to that Providence, 
which had deliver'd me from fo many unfeen Dan- 
gers, and had kept me from thofe Mifchieft which 

I could 



[ 2 °7] 



I could no way have been the Agent in delivering 
my felf from ; becaufe I had not the leaft Notion of 
any fuch Thing depending, or the leaft Suppofition 
of it being poflible. 

This renew'd a Contemplation, which often had 
come to my Thoughts in former Time, when firft 
I began to fee the merciful Difpofitions of Heaven, 
in the Dangers we run through in this Life. How 
"wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know no- 
thing of it. How when we are in (a Quandary, as 
we call it) a Doubt or Hefitation, whether to go 
this Way, or that Way, a fecret Hint (hall direft 
us this Way, when we intended to go that Way ; 
nay, when Senfe, our own Inclination, and perhaps 
Bufinefs has call'd to go the other Way, yet a ftrange 
Impreflion upon the Mind, from we know not what 
Springs, and by we know not what Power, fhall o- 
ver-rule us to go this Way ; and it fhall afterwards 
appear, that had we gone that Way which we (hould 
have gone, and even to our Imagination ought to 
have gone, we fhould have been ruin'd and loft : 
Upon thefe, and many like Reflections, I after- 
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That when- 
ever I found thofe fecret Hints, or preffings of my 
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that pre- 
fented ; or to going this Way, or that Way, I never 
fail'd to obey the fecret Diftate ; though I knew no 
other Reafon for it, than that fuch a Preflure, or 
fuch a Hint hung upon my Mind : I could give ma- 
ny Examples of the Succefs of this Conduft in the 
Courfe of my Life ; but more efpecially in the lat- 
ter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Ifland ; be- 
sides many Occafions which it is very likely I might 
have taken Notice of, if I had feen with the fame 
Eyes then, that I faw with now : But 'tis never too 
late to be wife ; and I cannot but advife all confi- 
dering Men, whofe Lives are attended with fuch ex- 
traordinary 



/ 



[ 208 ] 



traordinary Incidents as mine, or even though not 
fo extraordinary, not to flight fuch fecret Intimati- 
ons of Providence, let them come from what invifi- 
ble Intelligence they will, that I fhall not difcufe, 
and perhaps cannot account for ; but certainly they 
are a Proof of the Converie of Spirits, and the fe- 
cret Communication between thofe embody'd, and 
thofe unembody'd ; and fuch a Proof as can never 
1>e withftood : Of which I (hall have Ocoafion to 
give fome very remarkable Inftances, in the Re- 
mainder of my folitary Refidence in this difmal 
Place. 

I believe the Reader of this will not think 
ftrange, if I confefe that thefe Anxieties, thefe con- 
ftant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that was 
now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to 
all the Contrivances that I had laid for my future 
Accommodations and Conveniencies. I had the 
Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands, than 
that of my Food. I car'd not to drive a Nail, or 
chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noife I 
fhould make fhould be heard ; much lefs would I 
fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon ; and above all, I 
was intollerably uneafy at making any Fire, leaft 
the Smoke which is vilible at a great Diftance in the 
Day fhould betray me ; and for this Reafon I re- 
mov'd that Part of my Bufinefs which requir'd Fire ; 
fuch as burning of Pots, and Pipes, etc. into my* 
new Apartment in the Woods, where after I had 
been fome time, I found to my un(peakable Confo- 
lation, a meer natural Cave in the Earth, which 
went in a vaft way, and where, I dare fay, no Sa- 
vage, had he been at the Mouth of it, would be fo 
hardy as to venture in, nor indeed, would any Man 
•elfe ; but one who like me, wanted nothing fo much 
as a fafe Retreat. 

The- 



[ 20 9 ] 

The Mouth of this Hollow, was at the Bottom 
of a great Rock, where by meer accident, (I would 
fay, if I did not fee abundant Reafon to afcribe all 
fuch Things now to Providence) I was cutting 
down fome thick Branches of Trees, to make 
Charcoal ; and before I go on, I muft obferve the 
Reafon of my making this Charcoal ; which was 
thus : 

I was afraid of making a Smoke about my Ha- 
bitation, as I faid before ; and yet I could not live 
there without baking my Bread, cooking my Meat, 
fcfr. fo I contriv'd to burn fome Wood here, as I 
had feen done in England^ under Turf, till it be- 
came Chark, or dry Coal; and then putting the 
Fire out, I preferv'd the Coal to carry Home ; and 
perform the other Services which Fire was want- 
ing for at Home without Danger of Smoke. 

But this is by the by : While I was cutting down 
fome Wood here, 1 perceiv'd that behind a very 
thick Branch of low Bruftiwood, or under Wood, 
there was a kind of hollow Place ; I was curious 
to look into it, and getting with Difficulty into 
the Mouth of it, I found it was pretty large ; that 
is to (ay, fufficient for me to ftand upright in it, 
and perhaps another with me ; but I muft confefs 
to you, I made more haft out than I did in, when 
looking farther into the Place, and which was per- 
fectly dark, I few two broad fhinihg Eyes of fome 
Creature, whether Devil or Man I knew not, 
which twinkl'd like two Stars, the dim Light from 
the Cave's Mouth fhining dire&ly in and making 
the Refle&ion. 

However, after fome Paufe, I recover'd my felf, 
and began to call my felf a thoufand Fools, and 
tell my felf, that he that was afraid to fee the De- 
vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Ifland all 
alone; and that I durft to believe there was no- 

P thing 



[210] 



1 



thing in this Cave that was more frightful than my 
felf ; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took 
up a great Firebrand, and in I rufh'd again, with 
the Stick flaming in my Hand ; I had not gone 
three Steps in, but I was almoft as much frighted 
as I was before ; for I heard a very loud Sigh, like 
that of a Man in fome Pain, and it was follow'd 
by a broken Noife, as if of Words half exprefe'd, 
and then a deep Sigh again : I ftepp'd back, and 
was indeed ftruck with fuch a Surprize, that it put 
me into a cold Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on 
my Head, I will not anfwer for it, that my Hair 
might not have lifted it off. But ftill plucking up 
my Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my 
felf a little with confidering that the Power and 
Prefence of God was every where, and was able 
to proteft me ; upon this I ftepp'd forward again, 
and by the Light of the Firebrand, holding it up 
a little over my Head, I faw lying on the Ground 
a moft monftrous frightful old He-goat, juft ma- 
king his Will, as we lay, and gafping for Life, and 
dying indeed of meer old Age. 

I ftirr'd him a little to fee if I could get him out, 
and he eflay'd to get up, but was not able to raife 
himfelf ; and I thought with my felf, he might e- 
ven lie there ; for if he had frighted me fo, he 
would certainly fright any of the Savages, if any 
of them fhould be fo. hardy as to come in there, 
while he had any Life in him. 

I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and be- 
gan to look ronnd me, when I found the Cave was 
but very fmall, that is to fay, it might be about 
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei- 
ther round or fquare, no Hands having ever been 
employ 'd in making it, but thofe of meer Nature : 
I obferv'd alfo, that there was a Place at the far- 
ther Side of it, that went in farther, but was fo 

low, 



low, that it required me to creep upon my Hands 
and Knees to go into it, and whither I went I 
knew not $ fo having no Candle, I gave it over for 
iome Time ; but refolv'd to come again the next 
Day, provided with Candles, and a Tinder-box, 
which I had made of the Lock of one of the Muf- 
Jcets, with fome wild-fire in the Pan. 

Accordingly the next Day, I came provided 
•with fix large Candles of my own making ; for I 
made very good Candles now of Goat's Tallow; 
and going into this low Place, I was oblig'd to 
•creep upon all Fours, as I have /aid, almoft ten 
Yards ; which by the way, I thought was a 
Venture bold enough, considering that I knew not 
how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. 
When I was got through the Strait, I found the 
Roof rofe higher up, I believe near twenty Foot ; 
but never was fuch a glorious Sight feen in the I- 
iland, I dare fay, as it was, to look round the Sides and 
Roof of this Vault, or Cave ; the Walls refleded ioo 
thoufand Lights to me from my two Candles; 
what it was in Rock, whether Diamonds, or a- 
uy other precious Stones, or Gold, which I rather 
fuppos'd it to be, I knew not. 

The Place I was in, was a moft delightful Cavi- 
ty, or Grotto, of its kind, as could be expe&ed, 
though perfedly dark; the Floor was dry and 
level, and had a fort of fmall lofe Gravel upon 
it, fo that there was na naufeous or venemous 
Creature to be feen, neither was there any damp, 
or wet, on the Sides or Roof : The only Difficul- 
ty in it was the Entrance, which however as it 
was a Place of Security, and fuch a Retreat as I 
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience; fo 
that I was really rejoyc'd at the Difcovery, and re- 
folv'd without any Delay, to bring fome of thofe 
Things which I was moft anxious about, to this 

P 2 Place; 



[212] 



Place ; particularly, I refolv'd to bring hither my 
Magazine of Powder, and all my fpare Arms, viz. 
Two Fowling-Pieces, for I had three in all ; and 
three Muskets, for of them I had eight in all ; fo 
I kept at my Caftle only five, which ftood ready 
mounted like Pieces of Cannon, on my out-moflr 
Fence ; and were ready alfo to take out upon any 
Expedition. 

Upon this Oecafion of removing my Ammu- 
nition, I took oecafion to open the Barrel of Pow- 
der which I took up out of the Sea, and which 
had been wet; and I found that the Water had 
penetrated about three or four Inches into the 
Powder, on every Side, which caking and grow- 
ing hard, had preferv'd the infide like a Kernel 
in a Shell ; fo that I had near fixty Pound of very 
good Powder in the Center of the Cask, and this 
was an agreeable Difcovery to me at that Time ; 
fo I carry'd all away thither, never keeping above 
two or three Pound of Powder with me in my 
Caftle, for fear of a Surprize of any kind : I alfo 
carried thither all the Lead I had left for Bullets. 

I fancy'd my felf now like one of the ancient 
Giants, which are faid to live in Caves, and Holes, 
in the Rocks, where none could come at them; 
for I perfwaded my felf while I was here, if five 
hnndred Savages were to hunt me, they could ne- 
ver find me out ; or if they did, they would not 
venture to attack me here. 

The old Goat who I found expiring, dy'd inr 
the Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after I made 
this Difcovery ; and I found it much eafier to dig 
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and co- 
ver him with Earth, than to drag him out ; fo I 
interr'd him there, to prevent the Offence to my 
Nofe. 

I was- 



[ 2I 3] 



I was now in my twenty third Year of Refi- 
dence in this Ifland, and was fo naturaliz'd to the 
Place, and to the Manner of Living, that could I 
have but enjoy'd the Certainty that no Savages 
would come to the Place to difturb me, I could 
have been content to have capitulated for fpending 
the reft of my Time there, even to the laft Mo- 
ment, till I had laid me down and dy'd, like the old 
Goat in the Cave. I had alfo arriv'd to fome little 
Diverfions and Amufements, which made the Time 
pafs more pleafantly with me a great deal, than 
it did before ; as Firft, I had taught my Poll, as I 
noted before, to fpeak ; and he did it fo familiarly, 
and talk'd fo articulately and plain, that it was 
very pleaiant to me ; and he liv'd with me no lefs 
than fix and twenty Years : How long he might 
live afterwards, I know not ; though I know they 
have a Notion in the Brqfils, that they live a hun- 
dred Years ; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there 
ft ill, calling after Poor Robin Crufoe to this Day. I 
wifh no Englifh Man the ill Luck to come there and 
hear him ; but if he did, he would certainly believe 
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleafant 
and loving Companion to me, for no lefs than fix- 
teen Years of my Time, and then dy'd, of meer 
old Age ; as for my Cats, they multiply 'd as I have 
obferv'd to that Degree, that I was oblig'd to fhoot 
feveral of them at firft, to keep them from devour- 
ing me, and all I had ; but at length, when the 
two old Ones I had brought with me were gone, and 
after fome time continually driving them from me, 
and letting them have no Provifion with me, they 
all ran wild into the Woods, except two or three 
Favourites, which I kept tame ; and whofe Young 
when they had any, I always drown'd ; and thefe 
were part of my Family : Befides thefe, I always 
kept two or three houftiold Kids about me, who I 

P 3 taught 



[ 2I 4 ] 



taught to feed out of my Hand ; and I had two 
more Parrots which talk'd pretty well, and would 
all call Robin Crufoe ; but none like my firft ; nor in- 
deed did I take the Pains with any of them that I 
had done with him. I had alfo feveral tame Sea- 
Fowls, whofe Names I know not, who I caught 
upon the Shore, and cut their Wings ; and the lit- 
tle Stakes which I had planted before my Caftle 
Wall being now grown up to a good thick Grove* 
thefe Fowls all liv'd among thefe low Trees, and 
bred there, which was very agreeable to me; fa 
that as I faid above, I began to be very well con- 
tented with the Life I led, if it might but have 
been fecur'd from the dread of the Savages. 

But it was otherwife direfted ; and it may not be 
amifs for all People who fhall meet wirh my Story > 
to make this juft Obfervation from it, viz. How 
frequently in the Courfe of our Lives, the Evil, 
which in it felf we feek moft to fliun, and which* 
when we are fallen into it, is the moft dreadful ta 
us, is oftentimes the very Means or Door of our 
Deliverance, by which alone we can be rais'd again 
from the Affliction we are fallen into. I cou'd give 
many Examples of this in the Courfe of my unac- 
countable Life ; but in nothing was it more parti- 
cularly remarkable, than in the Circumftances of 
my laft Years of folitary Residence in this Ifland. 

It was now the Month of December, as I faid a- 
bove, in my twenty third Year ; and this being the 
Southern Solftice, for Winter I cannot call it, was 
the Particular Time of my Harveft, and requir'd 
my being pretty much abroad in the Fields, when 
going out pretty early in the Morning, even before 
it was thorow Day-light, I was furpriz'd with fee- 
ing a Light of fome Fire upon the Shore, at a Di- 
ftance from me, of about two Mile towards the- 
End of the Ifland, where I had obferv'd fome Sa- 
vages. 



["5] 



vages had been as before; but not on the other 
Side ; but to my great Affliction, it was on my 
Side of the Ifland. 

I was indeed terribly furpriz'd at the Sight, and 
ftepp'd fliort within my Grove, not daring to go 
out, leaft I might be furpriz'd ; and yet I had no 
more Peace within, from the Apprehenfions I had, 
that if thefc Savages in rambling over the Ifland, 
ftiould find my Corn ftanding, or cut, or any of my 
Works and Improvements, they would immediate- 
ly conclude, that there were People in the Place, 
and would then never give over till they had found 
me out : In this Extremity I went back diredkly to 
my Caftle, pull'd up the Ladder after me, and made 
all Things without look as wild and natural as 
I could. 

Then I prepared my felf within, putting my felf 
in a Pofture of Defence ; I loaded all my Cannon, 
as I call'd them; that is to fay, my Muskets, 
which were mounted upon my new Fortification, 
and all m/ Piftols, and refolv'd to defend my felf to 
the laft Gafp, not forgetting ferioufly to commend 
my felf to the Divine Protection, and earneftlv to 
pray to Goi to deliver me out of the Hands or the 
Barbarians ; and in this Pofture I continu'd about 
two Hours ; but began to be mighty impatient for 
Intelligence abroad, for I had no Spies to fend out. 

After fitting a while longer, and mufing what I 
(hould do in this Cafe, I was not able to bear fit- 
ting in Ignorar.ce any longer ; fo fetting up my Lad- 
der to the Side of the Hill, where there was a flat 
Place, as I obfcrv'd before, and then pulling the 
Ladder up after me, I fet it up again, and moun- 
ted to the Top of the Hill ; and pulling out my 
Perfpedtive Glafs, which I had taken on Purpofe, 
I laid me down flat on my Belly, on the Ground, 
and began to look for the Place; I prefently found 

P 4 there 



[ai6] 



there was no lefs than nine naked Savages, fitting 
round a fmall Fire, they had made, not to warm 
them ; for they had no need of that, the Weather 
being extreme hot; but as I fuppos'd, to drefe 
fome of their barbarous Diet, of humane Flefti, 
which they had brought with them, whether alive 
or dead I could not know. 

They had two Canoes with them, which they 
had haled up upon the Shore ; and as it was then 
Tide of Ebb, they feem'd to me to wait for the 
Return of the Flood, to go away again ; it is not 
eafy to imagine what Confufion this Sight put me 
into, efpecially feeing them come on my Side the 
Ifland, and fo near me too ; but when I oMerv'd 
their coming muft be always with the Cuirent of 
the Ebb, I began afterwards to be more fidate in 
my Mind, being fatisfy'd that I might go abroad 
with Safety all the Time of the Tide or Flood, if 
they were not on Shore before : And having made 
this Obfervation, I went abroad about my Harveft 
Work with the more Compofure. 

As I expeded, fo it proved ; for as ibon as the 
Tide made to the Weftward> I faw then all take 
Boat, and row (or paddle as we call it) all away : 
I fhould have obferv'd, that for an Hotr and more 
before they went off, they went to dancing, and I 
could eafily difcern their Poftures, *nd Geftures, 
by my Glafles : I could not perceive by my niceft 
Obfervation, but that they were ftaik naked, and 
had not the leaft covering npon then: ; but whether 
they were Men or Women, that I could not di- 
ftinguifh. 

As foon as I faw them fliipp'd, tnd gone, I took 
two Guns upon my Shoulders, a*d two Piftols at 
my Girdle, and my great Sword by my Side, with- 
out a Scabbard, and with all th* Speed I was able 
to make, I went away to the Hill, where I had dif- 

cover'd 



[ ai 7] 



cover'd the firft Appearance of all ; and as fbon 
as I gat thither, which was not lefe tlun two 
Hours ; for I could not go apace, being fo loaden, 
with Arms as I was. I perceiv'd there had been 
three Canoes more of Savages on that Place ; and 
looking out farther, I faw they were all at Sea to- 
gether, making over for the Main. 

This was a dreadful Sight to me, efpecially when 
going down to the Shore, I could fee the marks of 
Horror, which the difinal Work they had been a- 
bout had left behind it, viz. The Blood, the Bones, 
and part of the Flefh of humane Bodies, eaten and 
devour'd by thofe Wretches, with Merriment and 
Sport : I was fo fill'd with Indignation at the Sight, 
that I began now to premeditate the Deftru&ion 
of the next that I faw there, let them be who, or 
how many foever. 

It feem'd evident to me, that the Vifits which 
they thus make to this Ifland, are not very fre- 
quent ; for it was above fifteen Months before any 
more of them came on Shore there again ; that is 
to fay, I neither faw them, or any Footfteps, or 
Signals of ihem, in all that Time ; for as to the 
rainy Seafons, then they are fure not to come a- 
broad, at leaft not fo far ; yet all this while I liv'd 
uncomfortably, by reafon of the conftant Apprehen- 
sions I was in of their coming upon me by Surprize ; 
from whence I obferve, that the Expectation of £- 
vil is more bitter than the Suffering, efpecially if 
there is no room to (hake off that Expe&ation, or 
thofe Apprehenfions. 

During all this Time, I was in the murthering 
Humour ; and took up moft of my Hours, which 
fhould have been better employ'd, in contriving 
how to circumvent, and fall upon them, the very 
next Time I fhould fee them ; efpecially if they 
ihould be divided, as they were the laft Time, in- 
to 



[ai8] 



to two Parties ; nor did I confider at all, that if I 
kiird one Party, fuppofe Ten, or a Dozen, I was 
ftill the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill a- 
another, and fo another, even ad infinitum, till I 
fhould be at length no lefs a Murtherer than they 
were in being Man-eaters ; and perhaps much 
more fo. 

I (pent my Days now in great Perplexity, and 
Anxiety of Mind, expecting that I fhould one Day 
or other fall into the Hands of thefe mercilefs Crea- 
tures ; and if I did at any Time venture abroad, it 
was not without looking round me with the grea- 
teft Care and Caution imaginable ; and now I found 
to my great Comfort, how happy it was that I 
provided for a tame Flock or Herd of Goats ; for 
I durft not upon any account fire my Gun, efpeci- 
ally near that Side of the Ifland where they ufually 
came, leaft I fhould alarm the Savages ; and if 
they had fled from me now, I was fure to have 
them come back again, with perhaps two or 
three hundred Canoes with them, in a few Days> 
and then I knew what to expedt. 

However, I wore out a Year and three Months 
more, before I ever faw any more ef the Savages, and 
then I found them again, as I fhall foon obferve. It 
is true, they might have been there once, or twice ; 
but either they made no ftay, or at leaft I did not 
hear them ; but in the Month of May, as near as I 
could calculate, and in my four and twentieth Year > 
I had a very ftrange Encounter with them, of 
which in its Place. 

The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fif- 
teen or fixteen Months Interval, was very great ; I 
flept unquiet, dream'd always frightful Dreams, 
and often ftarted out of my Sleep in the Night : In 
the Day great Troubles overwhelm'd my Mind, 
and in the Night I dream'd often of killing the 

Savages, 



[219] 



Savages, and of the Reafons why I might juftify 
the doing of it ; but to wave all this for a while ; 
it was in the middle of May, on the fixteenth Day 
I think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar 
would reckon ; for I markt all upon the Poft ftill ; 
I fay, it was the fixteenth of May, that it blew a 
very great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great 
deal of Lightning, and Thunder, and a very foul 
Night it was after it ; I know not what was the 
particular Occafion of it ; but as I was reading in 
the Bible, and taken up with very ferious Thoughts 
about my prefent Condition, I was furpriz'd with a 
Noife of a Gun as I thought fir'd at Sea, 

This was to be fure a Surprize of a quite diffe- 
rent Nature from any I had met with before ; for 
the Notions this put into my Thoughts, were quite 
of another kind. I ftarted up in the greateft haft 
imaginable, and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the 
middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd if after me, 
and mounting it the fecond Time, got to the Top 
of the Hill, the very Moment, that a Flafh of Fire 
bid me liften for a fecond Gun,[which accordingly, 
in about half a Minute I heard ; and by the found, 
knew that it was from that Part of the Sea where I 
was driven down the Current in my Boat. 

I immediately confider'd that this muft be feme 
Ship in Diftrefs, and that they had fome Comrade, 
or fome other Ship in Company, and fir'd thefe Guns 
for Signals of Diftrefe, and to obtain Help : I had 
this Prefence of Mind at that Minute, as to think 
that though I could not help them, it may be 
they might help me ; fo I brought together all the 
dry Wood I could get at hand, and making a good 
handfome Pile, I fet it on Fire upon the Hill ; the 
Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely ; and though the 
Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out ; that 
I was certain, if there was any fuch Thing as a 

Ship, 



[ 220 ] 



Ship, they muft needs fee it, and no doubt they 
did ; for as foon as ever my Fire blaz'd up, I heard 
another Gun, and after that feveral others, all from 
the fame Quarter; I ply'd my Fire all Night long, 
till Day broke ; and when it was broad Day, and 
the Air clear'd up, I faw fbmething at a great Di- 
stance at Sea, full Eaft of the Ifland, whether a 
Sail, or a Hull, I could not diftinguifh, no not with 
my Glafles, the Diftance was fo great, and the 
Weather ftill fomething haizy alfo ; at leaft it was 
fo out at Sea. 

I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and foon 
perceiv'd that it did not move ; fo I presently con- 
cluded, that it was a Ship at an Anchor, and being 
eager, you may be fure, to be fatisfy'd, I took my 
Gun in my Hand, and run toward the South Side of 
the Ifland, to the Rocks where I had formerly been 
carry'd away with the Current, and getting up 
there, the Weather by this Time being perfe&ly 
clear, I could plainly fee to my great Sorrow, the 
Wreck of a Ship caft away in the Night, upon 
thofe concealed Rocks which I found, when I was 
out in my Boat ; and which Rocks, as they check'd 
the Violence of the Stream, and made a kind of 
Counter-ftream, or Eddy, were the Occafion of my 
recovering from the moft defperate hopelefs Con- 
dition that ever I had been in, in all my Life. 

Thus what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's 
Deftru&ion ; for it feems thefe Men, whoever they 
were, being out of their Knowledge, and the 
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven 
upon them in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at 
E. and E.N.E: Had they feen the Ifland, as I muft 
neceflarily fuppofe they did not, they muft, as I 
thought, have endeavour'd to have fav'd themfelves 
on Shore by the Help of their Boat ; but their firing 
of Guns for Help, efpecially when they faw, as I 

imagin'd, 



[221] 

imagin'd, my Fire, fill'd me with many Thoughts : 
Firft, I imagin'd that upon feeing my Light, they 
might have put themielves into their Boat, and 
have endeavour'd to make the Shore ; but that the 
Sea going very high, they might have been caft a- 
way; other Times I imagind, that they might 
have loft their Boat before, as might be the Cafe 
many Ways ; as particularly by the Breaking of the 
Sea upon their Ship, which many Times obliges 
Men to ftave, or take in Pieces their Boat; and 
fometimes to throw it over-board with their own 
Hands: Other Times I imagin'd, they had fome 
other Ship, or Ships in Company, who upon the 
Signals of Diftrefs they had made, had taken them 
up, and carry 'd them off : Other whiles I fancy'd, 
they were all gone off to Sea in their Boat, and be- 
ing hurry'd away by the Current that I had been 
formerly in, were carry'd out into the great Ocean, 
where there was nothing but Mifery and Perifhing ; 
and that perhaps they might by this Time think 
of ftarving, and of being in a Condition to eat 
one another. 

As all thefe were but Conjectures at beft ; fo m 
the Condition I was in, I could do no more than 
look on upon the Mifery of the poor Men, and 
pity them, which had ftill this good Effedt on 
my Side that it gave me more and more Caufe 
to give Thanks to God who had fo happily and 
comfortably provided for me in my defolate Con- 
dition ; and that of two Ships Companies who were 
now caft away upon this part of the World, not 
one Life fhould be fpar'd but mine : I learn'd here 
*gain to obferve, that it is very rare that the Pro- 
vidence of God cafts us into any Condition of Life 
fo low, or any Mifery fo great, but we may fee 
fomething or other to be thankful for ; and may 
fee others in worfe Circumftances than our own. 

Such 



[222] 



Such certainly was the Cafe of thefe Men, of 
whom I could not fo much as fee room to fup- 
pofe any of them were fav'd ; nothing could make 
it rational, (o much as to wifh, or expedt that they 
did not all perifh there ; except the Poflibility only 
of their being taken up by another Ship in Com- 
pany, and this was but meer Poflibility indeed ; for 
I faw not the leaft Signal or Appearance of any 
fuch Thing. 

I cannot explain by any poflible Energy of Words 
what a ftrange longing or hankering of Defires I 
felt in my Soul upon this Sight ; breaking out fome- 
times thus; O that there had been but one or 
two ; nay, or but one Soul fav'd out of this Ship, 
to have efcap'd to me, that I might but have had 
one Companion, one Fellow-Creature to have fpo- 
ken to me, and to have convers'd with ! In all the 
Time of my folitary life, I never felt fo earneft, 
fo ftrong a Defire after the Society of my Fellow- 
Creatures, or fo deep a Regret at the want of it. 

There are fome fecret moving Springs in the Af- 
fections, which when they are fet a going by fome 
Objeft in view ; or be it fome Objeft, though not in 
view, yet rendred prefent to the Mind by the 
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the 
Soul by its Impetuofity to fuch violent eager embra- 
cings of the ObjeA, that the Abfence of it is in- 
fupportable. 

Such were thefe earneft Wiftrings, That but one 
Man had been fav'd ! O that it had been but One ! I 
believe I repeated the Words, O that it bad been but 
One ! A thoufand Times ; and the Defires were fo 
mov'd by it, that when I fpoke the Words, my 
.Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers prefs 
the Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any foft 
Thing in my Hand, it would have crufht it invo- 
luntarily ; and my Teeth in my Head wou'd ftrike 

together 



t>*3 ] 



together, and fet againft one another fo ftrong, that 
for fome time I cou'd not part them again. 

Let the Naturalifts explain thefe Things, and 
the Reafon and Manner of them ; all I can fay to 
them, is, to defcribe the Fadt, which was even 
furprifing to me when I found it ; though I knew 
not from what it fhould proceed ; it was doubtlefe 
the effed of ardent Wifhes, and of ftrong . Ideas 
form'd in my Mind, realizing the Comfort, which 
the Converfation of one of my Fellow-Chriftians 
would have been to me* 

But it was not to be ; either their Fate or mine, 
or both, forbid it ; for till the laft Year of my being 
on this Ifland, I never knew whether any were fa- 
ved out of that Ship or no ; and had only the Affli- 
<ftion fome Days after, to fee the Corps of a drown- 
ded Boy come on Shore, at the End of the Ifland 
which was next the Shipwreck: He had on no 
Cloaths, but a Seaman's Waftcoat, a pair of open 
knee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blew Linnen Shirt ; 
but nothing to direft me fo much as to guefs what 
Nation he was of: He had nothing in his Pocket, 
but two Pieces of Eight, and a Tobacco Pipe; 
the laft was to me of ten times more value than 
the firft. 

It was now calm, and I [had a great mind to 
venture out in my Boat, to this Wreck; not doubt- 
ing but I might find fomething on board, that 
might be ufeful to me ; but that did not altogether 
prefe me fo much, as the Poflibility that there 
might be yet fome living Creature on board, whofe 
Life I might not only fave, but might by faving 
that Life, comfort my own to the laft Degree; 
and this Thought clung fb to my Heart, that I 
could not be quiet, Night or Day, but I muft 
venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck ; and 
committing the reft to God's Providence, I thought 

the 



[ 22 4J 



the Impreflion was fo ftrong upon my Mind, that 
it could not be refilled, that it muft come from 
fome invifible Direftion, and that I (hould be want- 
ing to my (elf if I did not go. 

Under the Power of this Impreffion, I haften'd 
back to my Caftle, prepar'd every Thing for my 
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot for 
frefli Water, a Compafs to fteer by, a Bottle of 
Rum ; for I had ftill a great deal of that left ; a Bas- 
ket full of Raifins : And thus loading my felf with 
every Thing neceflary; I went down to my Boat, 
got the Water out of her, and got her afloat, load- 
ed all my Cargo in her, and then went Home a- 
gain for more ; my fecond Cargo was a great Bag 
full of Rice, the Umbrella to fet up over my Head 
for Shade ; another large Pot full of frefti Water, 
and about two Dozen of my fmall Loaves, or 
Barley Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of 
Goat's-Milk, and a Cheefe ; all which, with great 
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my Boat; and 
praying to God to diredt my Voyage, I put out* 
and Rowing or Padling the Canoe along the 
Shore, I came at laft to the utmoft Point of the I- 
Hand on that Side, (viz.) N.E. And now I was 
to laun h out into the Ocean, and either to venture, 
or not to venture. I look'd on the rapid Currents 
which ran conftantly on both Sides of the Ifland, 
at a Diftance, and which were very terrible to 
me, from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had 
been in before, and my Heart began to fail me ;. 
for I forefaw that if I was driven into either of 
thofe Currents, I (hould be carry'd a vaft Way out 
to Sea, and perhaps out of my Reach, or Sight of 
the Ifland again ; and that then, as my Boat was but 
fmall, if any little Gale of Wind fhould rife, I 
(hould be inevitably loft. 

Thefe 



[ aa 5 ] 



Thefe Thoughts fo opprefs'd my Mind, that I 
began to give over my Enterprize, and having ha- 
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I 
ftept out, and fat me down upon a little rifing 
bit of Ground, very penfive and anxious, between 
Fear and Defire about my Voyage ; when as I was 
mufing, I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd, 
and the Flood come on, upon which my going 
was for fo many Hours impracticable ; upon this pre- 
fently it occurr d to me, that I fhould go up to the 
higheft Piece of Ground I could find, and obferve, 
if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or Currents 
lay, when the Flood came in, that I might judge 
whether if I was driven one way out, I might not 
expeft to be driven another way home, with the 
fame Rapidnefs of the Currents : This Thought 
was no fooner in my Head, but I caft my Eye up- 
on a little Hill, which fufficiently over-look'd the 
Sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view 
of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide, and which 
way I was to guide my felf in my Return ; here I 
found, that as the Current of the Ebb fet out clofe 
by the South Point of the I (land ; io the Current 
of the Flood let in clofe by the Shore of the North 
Side, and that I had nothing to do but to keep to 
the North of the Ifland in my Return, and I (hould 
do well enough. 

Encourag'd with this Obfervation, I refolv'd the 
Next Morning to fet out with the firft of the Tide ; 
and repofing my felf for the Night in theCanoe, under 
the great Watch-coat, I mention'd, I launched out : 
I made firft a little out to Sea full North, till I be- 
gan to feel the Benefit of the Current, which fet 
Eaftward, and which carry'd me at a great rate, 
and yet did not fo hurry me as the Southern Side 
Current had done before, and fo as to take from 
me all Government of the Boat; but having a 

Q^ ftrong 



[226] 



ftrong Steerage with my Paddle, I went at a great 
rate, dire&ly for the Wreck, and in lefs than two 
Hours I came up to it. 

It was a difmal Sight to look at : The Ship, 
which by its building was Spanijby ftuck faft, 
jaum'd in between two Rocks ; all the Stern and 
Quarter of her was beaten to pieces, with the Sea ; 
and as her Forecaftle, which ftuck in the Rocks, 
had run on with great Violence, her Mainmaft 
and Foremaft were brought by the Board ; that is to 
fay, broken (hort aff ; but her Boltlprit was found 
and the Head and Bow appear'd firm ; when I 
came clofe to her, a Dog appear'd upon her, who 
feeing me coming, yelp'd, and cry'd ; and as foon 
as I calPd him, jump'd into the Sea, to come to 
me, and I took him into the Boat ; but found him 
almoft dead for Hunger and Thirft : I gave him a 
Cake of my Bread, and he eat it like a ravenous 
Wolf, that had been ftarving a Fortnight in the 
Snow : I then gave the poor Creature tome frefti 
Water, with which, if I would have let him, he 
would have burft himfelf. 

After this I went on board ; but the firft Sight 
I met with, was two Men drown'd, in the Cook- 
room, or Forecaftle of the Ship, with their Arms 
faft about one another : I concluded, as is indeed 
probable, that when the Ship ftruck, it being in a 
Storm, the Sea broke fo high, and fb continually 
over her, that the Men were not able to bear it, 
and were ftrangled with the conftant rufhing in of 
the Water, as much as if they had been under Wa- 
ter. Befides the Dog, there was nothing left in 
the Ship that had life ; nor any Goods that I 
could see, but what were fpoil'd by the Water. 
There were fome Casks of Liquor, whether Wine 
or Brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the 
Hold ; and which, the Water being ebb'd out, I 

could 



[ 22 7] 



<ould fee ; but they were too big to meddle with : 
I faw feveral Chefts, which I bdiev'd belong'd to 
ibme of the Seamen ; and I got two of them into 
the Boat, without examining what was in them. 

Had the Stern of the Ship been fix'd, and the 
Forepart broken off, I am perfwaded I might have 
made a good Voyage ; for by what I found in thefe 
two Chefts, I had room to fuppofe, the Ship had 
a great deal of Wealth on board; and if I may 
guefs by the courfe (he fteer'd, (he muft have been 
bound from the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, 
in the South Part of America, beyond the Brafils, 
to the Havana, in the Gulph of Mexico, and fb per- 
haps to Spain : She had no doubt a great Treasure 
in her ; but of no ufe at that time to any body ; 
and what became of the reft of her People, I then 
knew not. 

I found befides thefe Chefts, a little Cask full of 
Liquor, of about twenty Gallons, which I got into 
my Boat, with much Difficulty ; there were feveral 
Muskets in a Cabin, and a great Powder-horn, with 
about 4 Pounds of Powder in it ; as for the Muskets 
I had no occasion for them; to I left them, but 
took the Powder-horn : I took a Fire Shovel and 
Tongs, which I wanted extremely; as alfo two 
little Brafe Kettles, a Copper Pot to make Choco- 
late, and a Gridiron; and with this Cargo, and 
the Dog, I came away, the Tide beginning to 
make home again; and the fame Evening, about 
an Hour within Night, I reach'd the Ifland again, 
weary and fatigued to the laft Degree. 

I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morn- 
ing I refolved to harbour what I had gotten in my new 
Cave, not to carry it home to my Caftle. After re- 
frefhing my felf, I got all my Cargo on Shore, and 
began to examine the Particulars: The Cask of 
Liquor I found to be a kind of Rum, but not fuch 

Q^2 as 



[ 228 ] 



as we had at the Brqftls ; and in a Word, not at all 
good; but when I came to open the Chefts, I 
round feveral Things, of great ufe to me : For 
Example, I found in one, a fine Cafe of Bottles, of 
an extraordinary kind, and filTd with Cordial Wa- 
ters, fine, and very good ; the Bottles held about 
three Pints each, and were tipp'd with Silver : I 
found two Pots of very good Succades, or Sweet- 
meats, fo faftned alfo on top, that the Salt Water 
had not hurt them ; and two more of the fame, 
which the Water had fpoil'd : I found fome very 
good Shirts, which were very welcome to me ; and 
about a dozen and half of Linnen white Handker- 
chiefs, and colour'd Neckcloths ; the former were 
alfo very welcome, being exceeding refrefhing to* 
wipe my Face in a hot Day ; befides this, when I 
came to the Till in the Cheft, I found there three 
great Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held about 
eleven hundred Pieces in all ; and in one of them, 
wrapt up in a Paper, fix Doubloons of Gold, and 
fome fmall Bars or Wedges of Gold ; I fuppofe they 
might all weigh near a Pound. 

The other Cheft I found had fome Cloaths in it,, 
but of little Value; but by the Circumftances it 
muft have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate ; though 
there was no Powder in it ; but about two Pound of 
fine glaz'd Powder, in three fmall Flasks, kept, I 
fuppofe, for charging their Fowling-Pieces on oc- 
cafion : Upon the whole, I got very little by this 
Voyage, that was of any ufe to me; for as to. the 
Money, I had no manner of occafion for it : Twas. 
to me as the Dirt under my Feet ; and I would 
have given it all for three or four pair of Englijb 
Shoes and Stockings; which were Things I great- 
ly wanted, but had not had on my Feet now for 
many Years : I had indeed gotten two pair of 
Shoes now, which I took off of the Feet of the 

two* 



[ i2 9] 



'two drown'd Men, who I faw in the Wreck ; and 
I found two pair more in one of the Chefts, which 
were very welcome to me ; but they were not like 
our Englijh Shoes, either for Eafe, or Service ; be- 
ing rather what we call Pumps, than Shoes : I 
found in this Seaman's Cheft, about fifty Pieces of 
Eight in Ryals, but no Gold ; I fuppofe this be- 
longed to a poorer Man than the other, which 
feem'd to belong to fome Officer. 

Well, however, I lugg'd this Money home to 
my Cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before 
which I brought from our own Ship ; but it was 
great Pity as I faid, that the other Part of this 
Ship had not come to my Share ; for I am fatisfy'd 
I might have loaded my Canoe feveral Times o- 
ver with Money, which if I had ever efcap'd to 
England, would have lain here fafe enough, till 
I might have come again and fetch'd it. 

Having now brought all my Things on Shore, 
and fecur'd them, I went back to my Boat, and 
row'd, or paddled her along the Shore, to her old 
Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the beft 
of my way to my old Habitation, where I found 
every thing fafe and quiet; fo I began to repofe 
my felf, live after my old fafhion, and take 
care of my Family Affairs ; and for a while, I 
liv'd eafy enough ; only that I was more vigilant 
than I uf d to be, look'd out oftner, and did not 
go abroad fo much ; and if at any time I did ftir 
with any Freedom, it was always to the Eaft 
Part of the Ifland, where I was pretty well fa- 
tisfy'd the Savages never came, and where I could 
go without fo many Precautions, and fuch a Load 
of Arms and Ammunition, as I always carry 'd with 
me, if I went the other way. 

I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more ; 

but my unlucky Head, that was always to let me 

Qi know 



[ 2 3° ] 

know it was bom to make my Body miferable,, 
was all this two Years fill'd with Proje&s and 
Defigns, how, if it were poflible, I might get away 
from this Ifland ; for fometimes I was for ma- 
king another Voyage to the Wreck, though my 
Reafon told me that there was nothing left there, 
worth the Hazard of my Voyage ; Sometimes for 
a Ramble one way, fometimes another ; and I be- 
lieve verily, if I had had the Boat that I went from 
Sallee in, I ftiould have ventur'd to Sea, bound 
any where, I knew not whither. 

I have been in all my Circumftances a Memento 
to thofe who are touched with the general Plague 
of Mankind, whence, for ought I know, one half 
of their Miferies flow ; I mean, that of not being 
fatisfy'd with the Station wherein God and Na- 
ture has plac'd them ; for not to look back upon 
my primitive Condition, and the excellent Advice 
of my Father, the Opposition to which, was, 
as I may call it \ my Original Sin ; my fubfequent 
Miftakes of the fame kind had been the Means 
of my coming into this miferable Condition; for 
had that Providence, which fo happily had feated 
me at the Brajils, as a Planter, blefs'd me with 
confin'd Defires, and I could have been contented 
to have gone on gradually, I might have been by 
this Time ; I mean, in the Time of my being in this I- 
Jland, one of the moft conliderable Planters in the 
Brafihy nay, I am perfwaded, that by the Improve- 
ments I had made, in that little Time I liv'd there, 
and the Encreafe I fhould probably have made, if I 
had ftay'd, I might have been worth an hundred 
thoufand Moydors ; and what Bufinefs had I to 
leave a fettled Fortune, a well ftock'd PJantation, 
improving and encreafing, to turn Supra-Cargo to- 
Guinea, to fetch Negroes; when Patience and 
Time would have fo encreas'd our Stock at 

Home* 



[ 2 3i ] 



Home, that we could have bought them at our own 
Door, from thofe whofe Bufinefs it was to fetch 
them ; and though it had coft us fomething more, 
yet the Difference of that Price was by no Means 
worth faving, at fo great a Hazard. 

But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young 
Heads, fo Refle&ion upon the Folly of it, is as 
ordinarily the Exercife of more Years, or of the 
dear bought Experience of Time ; and fo it was 
with me now ; and yet fo deep had the Miftake 
taken root in my Temper, that I could not fatisfy 
my felf in my Station, but was continually poring 
upon the Means, and Poffibility of my Efcape from 
this Place ; and that I may with the greater Plea- 
fure to the Reader, bring on the remaining Part of 
my Story, it may not be improper, to give fome 
Account of my firft Conceptions on the Subjedt of 
this foolifh Scheme, for my Efcape ; and how, and 
upon what Foundation I adted. 

I am now to be fuppos'd retir d into my Caftle, 
after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate laid 
up, and fecur'd under Water, as ufual, and my Con- 
dition reftor'd to what it was before : I had more 
Wealth indeed than I had before, but was not at all 
the richer ; for I had no more ufe for it y than the 
Indians of Peru had, before the Spaniards came 
there. 

It was one of the Nights in the rainy Seafon in 
March, the four and twentieth Year of my firft fet- 
ting Foot in this Ifland of Solitarinefs ; I was lying 
in my bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in 
Health, had no Pain, no Diftemper, no Uneafinefe 
of Body ; no, nor any Uneafinefe of Mind, more 
than ordinary ; but could by no means clofe my 
Eyes ; that is, fo as to fleep ; no, not a Wink all 
Night long, otherwife than as follows : 

0.4 It 



[ *3* ] 



It is as impoflible, as needlefs, to fet down the 
innumerable Crowd of Thoughts that whirl'd 
through that great thorow-fare of the Brain, the 
Memory, in this Night's Time : I run over the 
whole Hiftory of my Life in Miniature, or by A- 
bridgement, as I may call it^ to my coming to this 
Ifland, and alfo of the Part of my Life, fince I, 
came to this Ifland. In my Refledions upon the» 
State of my Cafe, fince I came on Shore on this I- 
fland, I was comparing the happy Pofture of my 
Affairs, in the firft Years of my Habitation here, 
compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear and Care, 
which I had liv'd ever fince I had feen the Print of 
a Foot in the Sand ; not that I did not believe the 
Savages had frequented the Ifland even all the while, 
and might have been feveral Hundreds of them at 
Times on Shore there ; but I had never known it, 
and was incapable of any Apprenfions about it ; 
my Satisfaction was perfeft, though my Danger 
was the fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing 
my Danger, as if I had never really been expos'd to 
it: This furnilh'd my Thoughts with many very 
profitable Reflections, and particularly this one, 
How infinitely Good that Providence is, which has 
provided in its Government of Mankind, fuch nar- 
row bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things, 
and though he walks in the midft of fo many thou- 
fand Dangers, the Sight of which, if difcover'd to 
him, would diftraft his Mind, and fink his Spirits ; 
he is kept ferene, and calm, by having the Events 
of Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing nothing 
the Dangers which furround him. 

After thefe Thoughts had for fome Time enter- 
tain'd me, I came to reflect ferioufly upon the real 
Danger I had been in, for fo many Years, in this 
very Ifland ; and how I had walk'd about in the 
greateft Security, and with all poflible Tranquilli- 
ty; 



[ 2 33 ] 



ty ; even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a 
Hill, a great Tree, or the cafual Approach of 
Night, had been between me and the worft kind 
of Deftrudtion, viz. That of falling into the Hands 
of Cannibals, and Savages, who would have feiz'd 
on me with the fame View, as I did of a Goat, or 
.a Turtle ; and have thought it no more a Crime to 
kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon, or a 
Curlieii : I would unjuftly flander my felf, if I 
fhould fay I was not fincerely thankful to my great 
Preferver, to whofe lingular Prote&ion I acknow- 
ledge, with great Humility, that all thefe unknown 
.Deliverances were due; and without which, I 
muft inevitably have fallen into their mercilefs 
Hands. 

When thefe Thoughts were over, my Head was for 
>fome time taken up in confidering the Nature of 
thefe wretched Creatures; I mean, the Savages; 
and how it came to pafs in the World, that the 
wife Governour of all Things fhould give up any of 
his Creatures to fuch Inhumanity ; nay, to fome- 
thing fo much below, even Brutality it felf, as to 
devour its own kind; but as this ended in fome 
i (at that Time fruitless) Speculations, it occurr'd 
to me to enquire, what Part of the World thefe 
Wretches liv'd in ; how far off the Coaft was from 
whence they came ; what they ventur'd over fo far 
from home for; what kind of Boats they had; 
. and why I might not order my felf, and my Bufi- 
nefs fo, that I might be as able to go over thi- 
ther, as they were to come tp me. 

I never fo much as troubl'd myfelf, to confider 
what I fhould do with my felf, when I came thi- 
ther ; what would become of me, if I fell into the 
Hands of the Savages ; or how I fhould efcape from 
them, if they attempted me ; no, nor fo much as 
how it was poflible for me to reach the Coaft, and 

not 



I>34] 



not to be attempted by fome or other of them, with- 
out any Poffibility of delivering my felf ; and if I 
fhould not fall into their Hands, what I fhould. do 
for Provision, or whither I fhould bend my Courfe ; 
none of thefe Thoughts, I fay, fo much as came 
in my way; but my mind was wholly bent upon 
the Notion of my pafling over in my Boat, to the 
Main Land : I look'd back upon my prefent Con- 
dition, as the moft miferable that could poffibly be > 
that I was not able to throw my felf into any thing 
but Death, that could be calTd worse; that if I 
reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps 
meet with Relief, or I might coaft along, as I did 
on the Shore of Africk^ till I came to fome in- 
habited Country, and where I might find fome Re- 
lief; and after all perhaps, I might fall in with 
fome Chriftian Ship, that might take me in ; and 
if the worfe came to the worft, I could but die, 
which would put an end to all thefe Miferies at 
once. Pray note, all this was the fruit" of a di- 
fturb'd Mind, an impatient Temper, made as it 
were defperate by the long Continuance of my 
Troubles and the Difappointments I had met in 
the Wreck, I had been on board of; and where I 
had been fo near the obtaining what I fo earneftly 
long'd for, viz. Some-body to fpeak to, and to 
learn fome Knowledge from of the Place where I 
was, and of the probable MeaAs of my Deliverance ; 
I fay, I was agitated wholly by thefe Thoughts : 
All my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Provi- 
dence, and waiting the Iflue of the Difpofitions of 
Heaven, feem'd to be fufpended; and I had, as it 
were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any thing, 
but to the Projeft of a Voyage to the Main, which 
came upon me with fuch Force, and fuch an Im- 
petuofity of Defire, that it was not to be re- 
fifted. 

When 



035 ] 



When this had agitated my Thoughts for two 
Hours, or more, with fuch Violence, that it fet 
my very Blood into a Ferment, and my Pulie beat 
as high as if I had been in a Feaver, meerly with 
the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it ; 
Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhaufted 
with the very Thought of it, threw me into a 
found Sleep; one would have thought, I fhould 
have dream'd of it : But I did not, nor of any 
Thing relating to it ; but I dream'd, that as I was 
going out in the Morning as ufual from my Caftle, 
I faw upon the Shore, two Canoes , and eleven Sava- 
ges coming to Land, and that they brought with 
them another Savage, who they were going to kill, 
in Order to eat him ; when on a fudden, the Sa- 
vage that they were going to kill, jumpt away, 
and ran for his Life ; and I thought in my Sleep, 
that he came running into my little thick Grove, 
before my Fortification, to hide himfclf; and that 
I feeing him alone, and not perceiving that the o- 
ther fought him that Way, fhow'd my felf to him, 
and fmiling upon him, encouraged him ; that he 
kneel'd down to me, feeming to pray me to aflift 
him ; upon which I fhew'd my Ladder, made him 
go up, and carry'd him into my Cave, and he be- 
came my Servant ; and that as fbon as I had got- 
ten this Man, I faid to my felf, now I may cer- 
tainly venture to the main Land ; for this Fellow 
will ferve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to 
do, and whether to go for Provisions ; and whe- 
ther not to go for fear of being devoured, what Pla- 
ces to venture into, and what to efcape : I wak'd 
with this Thought, and was under fuch inexpref- 
fible Impreffions of Joy, at the Profpeft of my Efcape 
in my Dream, that the Difappointments which I felt 
upon coming to my felf, and finding it was no 
more than a Dream, were equally extravagant the 

other 



[*3«] 



other Way, and threw me into a very great Deje- 
ction of Spirit. 

Upon this however, I made this Conclufion, 
that my only Way to go about an Attempt for an 
Efcape, was, if poffible, to get a Savage into my 
Poffeflion; and if poffible, it fhould be one of their 
Prifoners, who they had condemn'd to be eaten, 
and fhould bring thither to kill; but thefe 
Thoughts ftill were attended with this Difficulty, 
that it was impoffible to effeft this, without at- 
tacking a whole Caravan of them, and killing them 
all ; and this was not only a very defperate At- 
tempt, and might mifcarry ; but on the other 
Hand, I had greaty fcrupled the Lawfulnefs of it to 
me ; and my Heart trembled at the thoughts of 
ihedding fo much Blood, tho' it was. for my Deli- 
verance. I need not repeat the Arguments which 
occurr'd to me againft this, they being the fame 
mention'd before ; but tho' I had other Reafons to t 
offer now (viz. ) that thofe Men were Enemies to 
my Life, and would devour me, if they could; 
that it was Self-prefervation in the highest Degree, 
to deliver my felf from this Death of a Life, and 
was ading in my own Defence, as much as if they 
were actually aflaulting me, and the like. I fay, 
tho* thefe Things argued for it, yet the Thoughts 
of fhedding Humane Blood for my Deliverance, 
were very Terrible to me, and fuch as I could 
by no Means reconcile my felf to, a great 
while 

However at laft, after many fecret Difputes 
with my felf, and after great Perplexities about 
it, for all thefe Arguments one Way and another 
ftruggl'd in my Head a long Time, the eager 
prevailing Defire of Deliverance at length mafter'd 
all the reft ; and I refolved, if poffible, to get one 
of thofe Savages into my Hands, coft what it 

would. 



[ *37 ] 



would. My next Thing then was to contrive how 
to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to re- 
folve on : But as I could pitch upon no probable 
Means for it, fo I refolv'd to put my felf upon the 
Watch, to fee them when they came on Shore, and 
leave the reft to the Event, taking fuch Meafures 
as the Opportunity fhould prefent, let be what 
would be. 

With thefe Refblutions in my Thoughts, I fet my 
felf upon the Scout, as often as poffible, and in- 
deed fo often till I was heartily tir'd of it, for it 
was above a Year and Half that I waited, and for 
great part of that Time went out to the Weft End, 
and to the South Weft Corner of the Ifland, almoft 
every Day, to see for Canoes, but none appear'd. 
This was very difcouraging, and began to trour- 
ble me much, tho' I cannot fay that it did in this 
Cafe, as it had done fome time before that, (viz.) 
wear off the Edge of my Delireto the Thing. But 
the longer it feem'd to be delay'd, the more eager I 
was for it ; in a Word, I was not at firft fo care- 
ful to fhun the light of thefe Savages, and avoid 
being feen by them, as I was now eager to be upon 
them. 

Befides, I fancied my felf able to manage One, 
nay, Two or Three Savages, if I had them so as to 
make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever 
I fhould direft them, and to prevent their being a- 
ble at any time to do me any Hurt. It was a great 
while, that I pleas'd my felf with this Affair, but 
nothing ftill prefented ; all my Fancies and Schemes 
came to nothing, for no Savages came near me for 
a great while. 

About a Year and half after I had entertain'd 
thefe Notions, and by long mufing, had as it were 
relolved them all into nothing, for want of an Oc- 
cafion to put them in Execution, I was furpriz'd. 

one 



[»3«] 



one Morning early, with feeing no lefs than five 
Canoes all on Shore together on my fide the Ifland; 
and the People who belong'd to them all landed, 
and out of my fight: The Number of them broke 
all my Meafures, for feeing fo many, and knowing 
that they always came four or fir, or fometimes 
more in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of 
it, or how to take my Meafures, to attack Twen- 
ty or Thirty Men fingle handed ; fo I lay ftill in 
my Caftle, perplex'd and difcomfbrted : However 
I put my felf into all tie fame Poftures for an At- 
tack that I had formerly provided, and was juft 
ready for Adion, if any Thing had pre&nted ; ha- 
ving waited a good while, liftening to hear if they 
made any Noife ; at length being very impatient, 
I fct my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, *uid 
clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill, by my two 
Stages as ufual; ftanding fo however that my 
Head did not appear above the Hill, fo that 
they could not perceive me by any Means ; here I 
obferv'd by the help of my Perfpe&ivc Glafs, that 
they were no lefe than Thirty in Number, that 
they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat 
drefs'd. How they had cook'd it, that I knew not, 
or what it was ; but they were all Dancing in I know 
not how many barbarous Geftures and Figures, 
their own Way, round the Fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived 
by my Perfpective, two miterable Wretches dragg'd 
from the Boats, where it.feems they were laid by, 
and were now brought out for the Slaughter. I 
perceived one of them immediately fell, being 
knock'd down, I fuppofe with a Club or Wooden 
Sword, for that was their way, and two or three 
others were at work immediately cutting him open 
for their Cookery, while the other Viftim was left 
ftanding by himfelf, till they fhould be ready for 

him.

him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch fee- 
ing himfelf a little at Liberty, Nature infpir'd him 
with Hopes of Life, and he ftarted away from them, 
and ran with incredible Swiftnefs along the Sands 
dire&ly towards me, I mean towards that part of 
the Coaft, where my Habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frighted, (that I muft acknow- 
ledge) when I perceived him to run my Way ; and 
efpecially, when as I thought I faw him purfued 
by the whole Body, and now I expe&ed that part 
of my Dream was coming to pafs, and that he 
would certainly take fhelter in my Grove; but I 
could not depend by any means upon my Dream 
for the reft of it, (viz.) that the other Savages 
would not purfue him thither, and find him there. 
However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began 
to recover, when I found that there was not above 
three Men that follow'd him, and ftill more was I 
encourag'd, when I found that he outftrip'd them 
exceedingly in running, and gain'd Ground of 
them, fo that if he could but hold it for half an 
Hour, I faw eafily he would fairly get away from 
them all. 

There was between them and my Caftle, the 
Creek which I mention'd often at the firft part of 
my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the 
Ship; and this I faw plainly, he muft neceflarily 
fwim over, or the poor Wretch would be taken 
there : But when the Savage efcaping came thi- 
ther, he made nothing of it, tho* the Tide was 
then up, but plunging in, fwam thro* in about 
Thirty Strokes or thereabouts, landed and ran on 
with exceeding Strength and Swiftnefs ; when the 
Three Perfons came to the Creek, I found that 
Two of them could Swim, but the Third coud not, 
and that ftanding on the other Side, he look'd at 
the other, but. went no further; and foon after went 

foftly 



[2 4 o] 



foftly back again, which as it happen'd, was ve- 
ry well for him in the main. 

I obferv'd, that the two who fwam, were yet 
more than twice as long fwimming over the Creek, 
as the Fellow was, that fled from them : It came 
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed 
irrefiftibly, that now was my Time to get me a 
Servant, and perhaps a Companion, or Afliftant ; 
and that I was call'd plainly by Providence to fave 
this poor Creature's Life; I immediately run down 
the Ladders with all poflible Expedition, fetches 
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot 
of the Ladders, as I obferv'd above ; and getting 
up again, with the fame hafte, to the Top of the 
Hill, I crofs'd toward the Sea ; and having a very 
fhort Cut, and all down Hill, clapp'd my felf in 
the way, between the Purfuers, and the Purfu'd; 
hallowing aloud to him that fled, who looking 
back, was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me, 
as at them; but I beckon'd with my Hand to him, 
to come back ; and in the mean time, I flowly ad- 
vanc'd towards the two that follow'd ; then rufhing 
at once upon the foremoft, I knock'd him down with 
the Stock of my Piece; I was loath to fire, becaufe I 
would not have the reft hear; though at that 
diftance, it would not have been eafily heard, 
and being out of Sight of the Smoke too, they 
wou'd not have eafily known what to make of it: 
Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who 
purfu'd with him ftopp'd, as if he had been fright- 
ed ; and I advanc'd a-pacc towards him ; but as I 
came nearer, I perceiv'd prefently, he had a Bow 
and Arrow, and was fitting it to fhoot at me; fb I 
was then neceflitated to fhoot at him firft, which I 
did, and kill'd him at the firft Shoot; the poor Savage 
who fled, but had ftopp'd; though he faw both 
his Enemies fallen, and kill'd, as he thought; yet 

was 



[>4i] 



was fo frighted with the Fire, and Noife of my 
Piece ; that he flood Stock ftill, and neither came 
forward or went backward, tho' he feem'd rather 
enclin'd to fly ftill, than to come on ; I hollow'd 
again to him, and made Signs to come forward, 
which he eafily underftood, and came a little way, 
then ftopp'd again, and then a little further, and 
ftopp'd again, and I cou'd then perceive that he 
flood trembling, as if he had been taken Prifoner, 
and had juft been to be kill'd, as his two Enemies 
were ; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and 
gave him all the Signs of Encouragement that I 
could think of, and he came nearer and nearer, 
kneeling down every Ten or Twelve fteps in token 
of acknowledgement for my faving his Life : I fmil'd 
at him, and look'd pleafantly, and beckond to him 
to come ftill nearer ; at length he came clofe to me, 
and then he kneeFd down again, kiiFd the Ground, 
and laid his Head upon the Ground, and ta- 
king me by the Foot, fet my Foot upon his 
Head ; this it feems was in token of fwearing to be 
my Slave for ever ; I took him up, and made much 
of him, and encourag'd him all I could. But there 
was more work to do yet, for I perceived the Sa- 
vage who I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but 
ftunn'd with the blow, and began to come to him- 
felf ; fo I pointed to him, and fhowing him the Sa- 
vage, that he was not dead ; upon this he fpoke 
feme Words to me, and though I could not under- 
ftand them, yet I thought they were pleafant to hear, 
for they were the firft found of a Man's Voice, that 
I had heard, my own excepted, for above Twenty 
Five Years. But there was no time for fuch Refle- 
ctions now, the Savage who was knock'd down 
recover'd himfelf fo far, as to fit up upon the 
Ground, and I perceived that my Savage began to 
be afraid ; but when I faw that, I prefented my o- 

R ther 



[ 2,4*] 



ther Piece at the Man, as if I would (hoot him, 
upon this my Savage, for Jo I call bim now y made a 
Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung 
naked in a Belt by my fide ; so I did, he no foon- 
er had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one 
blow cut off his Head as cleaverly, no Executioner 
in Germany y could have done it fooner or better ; 
which I thought very ftrange, for one who I had 
Reafon to believe never (aw a Sword in his Life be- 
fore, except their own Wooden Swords ; however 
it feems, as I learn'd afterwards, they make their 
Wooden Swords fo fharp, fo heavy, and the Wood 
is fo hard, that they will cut off Heads even with 
them, ay and Arms, and that at one blow too; 
when he had done this, he comes laughing to me 
in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword 
again, and with abundance or Geftures which I 
did not underftand, laid it down with the Head 
of the Savage, that he had kill'd juft before me. 

But that which aftonifh'd him moft, was to 
know how I had kill'd the other Indian fo far off, 
fo pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let 
him go to him, fo I bad him go, as well as I could, 
when he came to him, he flood like one amaz'd, 
looking at him, turn'd him firft on one fide, then 
on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet had 
made, which it feems was juft in his Breaft, where 
it had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of 
Blood had follow'd, but he had bled inwardly, for 
he was quite dead ; He took up his Bow, and Ar- 
rows, and came back, fo I turn'd to go away, and 
beckon'd to him to follow me, making Signs to him, 
that more might come after them. 

Upon this he Sign'd to me, that he fhould bury 
them with Sand, that they might not be feen by 
the reft if they folio w'd ; and fo I made Signs again to 
him to do fo ; he fell to Work, and in an iriftant he 

had 



[ 2 43J 



had fcrap'd a Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, 
feig enough to bury the firft in, and then dragg'd 
him into it, and cover M him, and did Co alfo by 
the other ; I believe he had bury'd them both in a 
Quarter of an Hour; then calling him away, I car- 
ry'd him not to my Caftle, but quite away to my 
Cave, on the farther Part of the Ifland ; (b I did 
not let my Dream come to pafs in that Part. viz. 
That he came into my GroVe for fhelter. 

Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raifins 
to eat, and a Draught of Water, which I found he 
was indeed in great Diftrefe for, by his Running ; 
and having refrefh'd him, I made Signs for him to 
•go lie down and fleep ; pointing to a Place where 
I had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a 
Blanket upon it, which I ufed to fleep upon my felf 
ibmetimes; fo the poor Creature laid down, and 
went to fleep. 

He was a comely handfome Fellow, perfectly well 
made ; with ftraight ftrong limbs, not too large; tall 
and well fhap'd, and as I reckon, about twenty fix 
Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance, 
not a fierce and furly A(pe<5t ; but feem'd to have 
Something very manly in his Face, and yet he had - 
all the Sweetnefs and Softnefs of an European in his 
Countenance too, efpecially when he fmil'd. His 
Hair was long and black, not curl'd like Wool ; his 
Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity 
and fparkling Sharpnefs in his Eyes. The Colour of 
his Skin was not quite black, but very tawny ; and 
yet not of an ugly yellow naufeous tawny, as the 
Brajilians, and Virginians, and other Natives of A- 
merica are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive Co- 
lour, that had in it fbmething very agreeable; tho' 
not very eafy to defcribe. His Face was round, 
and plump ; his Nofe fmall, not flat like the Ne- 
groes, a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his 

R 2 fine 



[>44] 



fine Teeth well fet, and white as Ivory. After he 4 
had flumber'd, rather than flept, about half ar^ 
Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of the Cave 
to me; for I had been milking my Goats, which I 
had in the Enelofure juft by : When he efpy'd rac,, 
he came running to me, laying himfelf down 
again upon the Ground, with all the poffible Signs- 
of an humble thankful Difpofition, making a many 
antick Geftures to fhow it : At laft he lays his 
Head flat upon the Ground, clofe to my Foot, and 
fets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had done 
before; and after this, made all the Signs to me of 
Subje&ion, Servitude, and Submiffion imaginable,, 
to let me know, how he would ferve me as long as- 
he liv'd ; I underftood him in many Things, and let 
him know, I was very well pleas'd with him ; in a 
little Time I began to fpeak to him, and teach him, 
to fpeak to me ; and firft, I made him know his* 
Name fhould be Friday, which was the Day I fav'd- 
his Life ; I calTd him fo for the Memory of the 
Time ; I likewife taught him to fay Mafter, and 
then let him know, that was to be my Name ; I 
likewife taught him to fay, Yes, and No, and to? 
know the Meaning of them ; I gave him fome 
Milk, in an earthen Pot, and let him fee me- 
Drink it before him, and fop my Bread in it; and 
I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do the like, which' 
he quickly comply'd with, and made Signs that it 
was very good for him. 

I kept there with him all that Night ; but as 
foon as it was Day, I beckon'd to him to come 
with me, and let him know, I would give him fbme 
Cloaths, at which he feem'd very glad , for he was- 
ftark naked : As we went by the Place where he 
had bury'd the two Men, he pointed exaftly to the 
Place, and ftiew'd me the Marks that he had 
made to find them again, making Signs to me, 

that 



[ 2 45 ] 



#hat we ihould dig them up again, and eat them ; 
at this I appear'd very angry, exprefs'd my Ab- 
horrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the 
Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to 
him to come away, which he did immediately, 
with great Submiffion. I then led him up to the 
Top of the Hill, to fee if his Enemies were gone ; 
and pulling out my Glafs, I look'd, and faw plain- 
ly the Place where they had been, but no appea- 
rance of them, or of their Canoes ; fo that it was 
plain they were gone, and had left their two 
Comrades behind them, without any fearch after 
them. 

Btit'I was not content with this Difcovery ; but 
having now more Courage, and confequently more 
-Curiofity, I takes my Man Friday with me, giving 
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and 
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could ufe 
*very dextroufly, making him carry one Gun for me, 
wand I two for my felf, and away we march'd to 
the Place, where thefe Creatures had been ; for I 
had a Mind now to get fome fuller Intelligence of 
them : When I came to the Place, my very Blood 
ran chill in my Veins, and my Heart funk within me, 
at the Horror of the Speftacle : Indeed it was a 
•dreadful Sight, at leaft it was fo to me; though 
Friday made nothing of it : The Place was cover'd 
with humane Bones, the Ground dy'd with their 
Blood, great Pieces of Flefti left here and there, 
half eaten, mangl'd and fcorch'd ; and in ftiort, all 
the Tokens of the triumphant Feaft they had been 
making there, after a Viftory over their Enemies : 
I faw three Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of three 
or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other Parts 
of the Bodies; and Friday \ by his Signs, made me 
underftand, that they brought over four Prifoners 
to feaft upon ; that three of them were eaten up, 

R 3 and 



I>4<5] 



and that he, pointing to himfelf, was the fourth r 
That there had been a great Battle between them^ 
and their next King, whofe Subjects it Teems he had 
been one of; and that they had taken a great Num- 
ber of Prifoners, all which were carry'd to feveral 
Places by thofe that had taken them in the Fights 
in order to feaft upon them, as was done here by 
thefe Wretches upon thofe they brought hither. 

I caus'd Friday to gather all the Skulls, Bones, 
Flefh, and whatever remain'd, and lay them toge- 
ther on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it, 
and burn them all to Aihes : I found Friday had ftill 
a hankering Stomach after fome of the Flefh, and 
was ftill a Cannibal in his Nature ; but I difco- 
ver'd fb much Abhorrence at the very Thoughts* 
of it, and at the leaft Appearance of it, that he 
durft not difcover it ; for I had by fome Means let 
him know, that I would kill him if he offer'd it. 

When we had done this, wfc came back to our 
Caftle, and there I fell to work for my MatiFriday ;. 
and firft of all, I gave him a pair of Linnen Draw- 
ers, which I had out of the poor Gunner's Cheft 
I mentioned, and which I found in the Wreck ; and 
which with a little Alteration fitted him very well ;. 
then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-skin, as well as 
my Skill would allow ; and I was now grown a. 
tollerable good Taylor; and I gave him a Cap, 
which I had made of a Hare-skin, very convenient,, 
and faftiionable enough ; and thus he was cloath'd. 
for the prefent, tollerably well ; and was mighty 
well pleas'd to fee himfelf almoft as well cloath'd 
as his Matter : It is true, he went awkwardly in 
thefe Things at firft; wearing the Drawers was. 
very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Waft- 
coat gall'd his Shoulders, and the infide of his* 
Arms; but a little eafing them where he complain'd 

they* 



[ 247 ] 



they hurt him, and ufing himfelf to them, at length 
he took to them very well. 

The next Day after I came home to my Hutch 
with him, I began to confider where I fhould lodge 
him, and that I might do well for him, and yet be 
perfectly eafy my felf ; I made a little Tent for him 
in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications, 
in the infide of the laft, and in the outfide of the firft ; 
and as there was a Door, or Entrance there into my 
Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door Cafe, and a 
Door to it of Boards, and fet it up in the Paflage, 
a little within the Entrance ; and caufing the Door 
to open on the infide, I barr'd it up in the Night, 
taking in my Ladders too ; fo that Friday could no 
way come at me in the infide of my innermoft wall, 
without making fo much Noife in getting over, that 
it muft needs waken me ; for my firft Wall had now 
a compleat Roof over it of long Poles, covering all 
my Tent, and leaning up to the fide of the Hill, 
which was again laid crofs with fmaller Sticks in- 
ftead of Laths, and then thatch'd over a great 
Thicknefs, with the Rice Straw, which was ftrong 
like Reeds ; and at the Hole or Place which was 
left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had plac'd a 
kind of Trap-door, which if it had been attemp- 
ted on the outfide, would not have ^pen'd at all, 
but would have fallen down, and made a great 
Noife ; and as to Weapons, I took them all in to 
my Side every Night. 

But I needed none of all this Precaution ; for ne- 
ver Man had a more faithful, loving, fincere Ser- 
vant, than Friday was to me ; without Paflions, 
Sullennefs or Defigns, perfe&ly oblig'd and en- 
gag'd ; his very Affedions were ty'd to me, like 
thofe of a Child to a Father ; and I dare fay, he 
would have facrific'd his Life for the faving mine 
upon any occafion whatfoever ; the many Teftimo- 

R 4 nies 



[148] 



nies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt, and 
(bon convinced me, that I needed to ufe no Precau- 
tions as to my Safety on his Account. 

This frequently gave me occafion to obferve, 
and that with wonder, that however it had pleafd 
God, in his Providence, and in the Government of 
the Works of his Hands, to take from fo great a 
Part of the World of his Creatures, the beft ufes to 
which their Faculties, and the Powers of their 
Souls are adapted ; yet that he has beftow'd upon 
them the fame Powers, the fame Reafon, the fame 
Afle&ions, the fame Sentiments of Kindnefs and 
Obligation, the fame Paffions and Refentments 
of Wrongs ; the fame Senfe of Gratitude, Sincerity, 
Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good, 
and receiving Good, that he has given to us ; and 
that when he pleafes to offer to them Occafions of 
exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready 
to apply them to the right Ufes for which they 
were beftowM, than we are : and this made me very 
melancholly ibmetimes, in reflefting as the feveral 
Occafions prefented, how mean a Ufe we make of 
all thefe, even though we have thefe Powers en- 
lighten'd by the great Lamp of Inftru&ion, the Spi- 
rit of God, and by the Knowledge of his Word, 
added to our Underftanding ; and why it has pleas'd 
God to hide the like faving Knowledge from fo ma- 
ny Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this 
poor Savage, would make a much better ufe of 
it than we did. 

From hence, I (bmetimes was led too far to 
invade the Soverainty of Providence, and as it were 
arraign the Juftice of fo arbitrary a Difpofition of 
Things, that fhould hide that Light from fome, and 
reveal it to others, and yet expeft a like Duty 
from both : But I fhut it up, and check'd my 
Thoughts with this Conclufion, (ift.) That we 

did 



C *49 ] 

did not know by what Light and Law thefe fliould 
be Condemn'd; but that as God was neceffarily, 
and by the Nature of his Being, infinitely Holy 
and Juft, fo it could not be; but that if thefe 
Creatures were all fentenc'd to Abfence from him- 
felf, it was on account of finning againft that Light 
which, as the Scripture fays, was a Law to them- 
selves, and by fuch Rules as their Confciences would 
acknowledge to be juft, tho' the Foundation was not 
difcover'd to us : And (2d.) that ftill as we are all 
the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no Veflel 
•could fay to him, Why haft thou form'd me thus? 

But to return to my New Companion; I was 
gready delighted with him, and made it my Bufi- 
nefs to teach him every Thing, that was proper to 
make him ufeful, handy, and helpful ; but efpeci- 
ally to make him {peak, and under ftand me when 
I fpake, and he was the apteft Schollar that ever 
was, and particularly was fo merry, fo conftantly 
diligent, and fo pleas'd, when he cou'd but un- 
derftand me, or make me underftand him, that it 
was very pleafant to me to talk to him ; and now 
my Life began to be fo eafy, that I began to fay to 
my felf, that could I but have been iafe from more 
Savages, I cared not, if I was never to remove from 
•the place while I lived. 

After I had been two or three Days return'd to 
my Caftle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday 
off from his horrid way of feeding, and from the 
Relifti of a Cannibal's Stomach, I ought to let him 
tafte other Flefh ; fo I took him out with me one 
Morning to the Woods - I went indeed intending 
to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring him 
home and drefs it. But as I was going, I faw 
a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and two 
young Kids fitting by her, I catch'd hold of Fri- 
day > hold fays I, ftand ftill ; and made Signs to him 

not 



[ 2 5° ] 



not to ftir, immediately I prefented my Piece, fhot 
and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Cteature 
who had at a Diftance indeed feen me kill the 
Savage his Enemy, but did not know, or could 
imagine how it was done, was fenfibly fur- 
priz'd, trembled, and (hook, and look'd (6 a- 
maz'd, that I thought he would have funk down. 
He did not fee the Kid I fhot at, or perceive I 
had kill'd it, but ripp'd up his Waftcoat to feel if 
he was not wounded, and as I found, prefently 
thought I was refolv'd to kill him ; for he came 
and kneel'd down to me, and embraceing my 
Knees, faid a great many Things I did not under- 
ftand ; but I could eafily fee that the meaning was 
to pray me not to kill him. 

I fbon found a way to convince him that I would 
do him no harm, and taking him up by the Hand 
laugh'd at him, and pointed to the Kid which I 
had kill'd, beckoned to him to run and fetch it,, 
which he did ; and while he was wondering and 
looking to fee how the Creature was kill'd, I load- 
ed my Gun again, and by and by I faw a great 
Fowl like a Hawk fit upon a Tree within Shot ; 
fo to let Friday underftand a little what I would do, 
I call'd him to me again, pointed at the Fowl which 
was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a 
Hawk, I fay pointing to the Parrot, and to my Gun, 
and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let him fee 
I would make it fall, I made him underftand that 
I would fhoot and kill that Bird ; according I fir'd 
and bad him look, and immediately he faw the 
Parrot fall, he ftood like one frighted again, not- 
withftanding all I had faid to him ; and I found he 
was the more amaz'd becaufe he did not fee me 
put any Thing into the Gun; but thought that 
there muft be fbme wonderful Fund of Death and 
Deftruftion in that Thing, able to kill Man, Beaft> 

Bird, 



I>5i] 



Bird, or any Thing near, or far off; and the Afto- 
nifliment this created in him was fuch, as could 
not wear off for a long Time; and I believe, if I 
would have let him, he would have worfhipp'd 
me and my Gun : As for the Gun it felf, he would 
not fo much as touch it for feveral Days after ; but 
would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an- 
fwer'd him, when he was by himfelf ; which, as I 
afterwards learn'd of him, was to defire it not to 
kill him. 

Well, after his Aftpniftiment was a little over at 
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird I 
had fliot, which he did, but ftay'd fome Time; 
for the Parrot not being quite dead, was flutter'd 
away a good way off from the Place where flie fell; 
however, he found her, took her up, and brought 
her to me ; and as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance a- 
bout the Gun before, I took this Advantage to 
charge the Gun again, and not let him fee me do 
it, that I might be ready for any other Mark that 
might prefent; but nothing more offer'd at that 
Time ; fo I brought home the Kid, and the fame 
Evening I took the Skin off, and cut it out as well 
as I could ; and having a Pot for that purpofe, I 
boird, or ftew'd fome of the Flefti, and made 
fome very good Broth ; and after I had begun to 
eat fome, I gave fome to my Man, who feem'd ve- 
ry glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that 
which was ftrangeft to him, was, to fee me eat 
Salt with it ; he made a Sign to me, that the Salt 
was not good to eat, and putting a little into his 
own Mouth, he feem'd to naufeate it, and would 
fpit and fputter at it, waftiing his Mouth with frefh 
Water after it; on the other hand, I took fome 
Meat in my Mouth without. Salt, and I pretended 
to fpit and fputter for want of Salt, as faft as he 
had done at the Salt; but it would not do, he 

would 



05 2 ] 

would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his 
Broth ; at leaft not a great while, and then but a 
very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiTd Meat and 
Broth, I was refolv'd to ftaft him the next Day 
with roafting a Piece of the Kid ; this I did by- 
hanging it before the Fire, in a String, as I had 
feen many People do in England, fetting two Poles 
up, one on each fide the Fire, and one crofe on the 
Top, and tying the String to the Crofs-ftick, letting 
the Meat turn continually : This Friday admir'd ve- 
ry much ; but when he came to tafte the Flefti, he 
took fo many ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, 
that I could not but underftand him ; and at laft 
he told me he would never eat Man's Flefh any 
more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next Day I fet him to work to beating fome 
Corn out, and fifting it in the manner I us'd to do, 
as I obferv'd before, and he foon underftood how to 
do it as well as I, efpecially after he had feen what 
the Meaning of it was, and that it was to make 
Bread of; for after that I let him fee me make my 
Bread, and bake it too, and in a little Time Friday 
was able to do all the Work for me, as well as I 
could do it my felf. 

I begun now to confider, that having two Mouths 
to feed, inftead of one, I muft provide more Ground 
for my Harveft, and plant a larger Quantity of 
Corn, than I us'd to do ; fo I mark'd ouc a larger 
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the fame 
Manner as before, in which Friday not only work'd 
very willingly, and very hard; but did it very 
chearfully, and I told him what it was for; that it 
was for Corn to make more Bread, becaufe he was 
now with me, and that I might have enough for 
him, and my felf too : He appeared very fenfible of 
that Part, and let me know, that he thought I had 

much 



C 2 53 ] 



much more Labour upon me on his Account, than I 
had for my felf ; and that he would work the harder 
for me, if I would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleafanteft Year of all the Life I led 
in this Place; Friday began to talk pretty well, and 
underftand the Names of almoft every Thing I had 
occafion to call for, and of every Place I had to fend 
him to, and talk'd a great deal to me; fo that in 
fhort I began now to have fome Ufe for my Tongue 
again, which indeed I had very little occafion for 
before; that is to fay, about Speech; befides the 
Pleafure of talking to him, I had a Angular Satisfa- 
ction in the Fellow himfelf ; his finjple unfeign'd 
Honefty, appear'd to me more and more every Day, 
and I began really to love the Creature ; and on his 
Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it was poffible 
for him ever to love any Thing before. 

I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering 
Inclination to his own Country again, and having 
learn'd him Englijh fo well that he could anfwer me 
almoft any Queftions, I ask'd him whether the Na- 
tion that he belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle > 
at which he fmil'd; and faid; yes, yes, we always 
fight the better ; that is, he meant always get the 
better in Fight; and (o we began the following, 
Difcourfe: You always fight the better faid I, How 
came you to be taken Prifoner then, Friday ? 

Friday y My Nation beat much, for all that. 

Mafter, How beat ; if your Nation beat them, 
how came you to be taken ? 

Friday y They more many than my Nation in the 
Place where me was; they take one, two, three, 
and me ; my Nation over beat them in the yonder 
Place, where me no was; there my Nation take 
one, two, great Thoufand. 

Mafter> But why did not your Side recover you 
from the Hands of your Enemies then? 

Friday 



[>54J 



Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and 
make go in the Canoe ; my Nation have no Canoe 
that time. 

Mafter, Well, Friday, and What does your Na- 
tion do with the Men they take, do they carry them 
away, and eat them, as thefe did ? 

Friday, Yes, my Nation eat Man's too, eat 
all up. 

Mafter, Where do they carry them ? 

Friday, Go to other Place where they think. 

Mafter, Do they come hither ? 

Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither; come other 
elfe Place. 

Mafter, Have you been here with them ? 

Friday, Yes, I been here; [points to the N.W. Side 
of the I/land] which it feems was their Side. 

By this I underftood, that my Man Friday had 
formerly been among the Savages, who us'd to 
come on Shore on the farther Part of the I- 
fland, on the fame Man eating Occafions that he 
was now brought for ; and fometime after, when 
I took the Courage to carry him to that Side, be- 
ing the fame I formerly mention'd, he presently 
knew the Place, and told me, he was there once 
when they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and 
one Child ; he could not tell Twenty in Engli/h ; 
but he numbred them by laying fo many Stones on 
a Row, and pointing to me to tell them over. 

I have told this Paflage, becaufe it introduces 
what follows ; that after I had had this Difcourfe 
with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our I- 
fland to the Shore, and whether the Canoes were 
not often loft ; he told me, there was no Danger, 
no Canoes ever loft ; but that after a little way out 
to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind, always 
one way in the Morning, the other in the Af- 
ternoon. 

This 



[ 2 55 ] 

This I underftood to be no more than the Sets 
of the Tide, as going out, or coming in ; but 
I afterwards underftood, it was occafion'd by the 
great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroo- 
nooko ; in the Mouth, or the Gulph of which Ri- 
ver, as I found afterwards, our Ifland lay ; and this 
Land which I perceiv'd to the W. and N. W. was 
the great Ifland Trinidad, on the North Point of the 
Mouth of the River : I ask'd Friday a thoufand 
Queftions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the 
Sea, the Coaft, and what Nation were near ; he 
told me all he knew with the greateft Opennefe i- 
maginable ; I ask'd him the Names of the feveral 
Nations of his Sort of People ; but could get no o- 
ther Name than Caribs ; from whence I eafily un- 
derftood, that thefe were the Caribbees, which our 
Maps place on the Part of America , which reaches 
from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana, 
and onwards to St. Martha : He told me that up a 
great way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond 
the Setting of the Moon, which muft be JV. from 
their Country, their dwelt white bearded Men, 
like me ; and pointed to my great Whiskers, which 
I mention'd before ; and that they had kill'd much 
Mans, that was his Word ; by all which I underftood, 
he meant the Spaniards, whofe Cruelties in America 
had been fpread over the whole Countries, and 
was remember'd by all the Nations from Father 
to Son. 

I enquir'd if he could tell me how I might come 
from this Ifland, and get among thofe white Men; 
he told me, yes, yes, I might go in two Canoe ; I 
could not underftand what he meant, or make him 
defcribe to me what he meant by two Canoe i till at 
laft with great Difficulty, I found he meant it muft 
be in a large great Boat, as big as two Canoes. 

This 



C *5<* ] 



This Part of Friday's Difcourfe began to relifh 
with me very well, and from this Time I entertain'd 
fome Hopes, that one Time or other, I might find 
an Opportunity to make myEfcape from this Place ; 
and that this poor Savage might be a Means to 
help me to do it. 

During the long Time that Friday has now been 
with me, and that he began to {peak to me, and 
understand me, I was not wanting to lay a Foun- 
dation of Religious Knowledge in his Mind ; par- 
ticularly I ask'd him one Time who made him? 
The poor Creature did not understand me at all, 
but thought I had ask'd him who was his Father; but 
I took it by another handle, and ask'd him who 
made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the 
Hills, and Woods ; he told me it was one old Be- 
namuckee, that liv'd beyond all : He could defcribe 
nothing of this great Perfon, but that he was very 
old ; much older he faid than the Sea* or the Land; 
than the Moon, or the Stars : I ask'd him then, if 
this old Perfon had made all Things, why did not 
all Things worfliip him ; he look'd very grave 
and with a perfeft Look of Innocence, faid, All 
Things do Jay to bim : I ask'd him if the People 
who die in his Country went away any where ; he 
faid, yes, they all went to Benamuckee: then I 
ask'd him whether thefe they eat up went thither 
he too, faid yes. 

From thefe Things, I began to inftruft him in 
the Knowledge of the true God : I told him that 
the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there,, 
pointing up towards Heaven : That he governs 
the World by the fame Power and Providence by 
which he had made it: That he was omnipotent,, 
could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to 
us, take every Thing from us ; and thus by De- 
grees I open'd his Eyes. He liftned with great At- 



tention 



[ 2 57 ] 

tention, and receiv'd with Pleafure the Notion of 
J ejus Chrift being fent to redeem us, and of the 
Manner of making our Prayers to God, and his 
being able to hear us, even into Heaven ; he told 
me one Day, that if our- God could hear us up be- 
yond the Sun, he muft needs be a greater God than 
their Benamuckee, who liv'd but a little way off, 
and yet could not hear, till they went up to the 
great Mountains where he dwelt, to fpeak to him ; 
I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to fpeak to 
him ; he faid no, they never went that were young 
Men ; none went thither but the old Men, who he 
call'd their Oowocakee, that is, as I made him explain 
it to me, their Religious, or Clergy, and that they 
went to fay 0,(so he call'd faying Prayers) and then 
came back, and told them what Benamuckee faid : 
By this I obferv'd, That there is Prieflcraft, even a- 
mongft the moft blinded ignorant Pagans in the 
World ; and the Policy of making a fecret Religi- 
on, in order to preferve the Veneration of the Peo- 
ple to the Clergy, is not only to be found in the Ro- 
man, but perhaps among all Religions in the World, 
even among the moft brutifti and barbarous Sa- 
vages. 

I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud, to my 
Man Friday , and told him, that the Pretence of 
their old Men going up the Mountains, to fay O 
to their God Benamuckee, was a Cheat, and their 
bringing Word from thence what he faid, was 
much more fo; that if they met with any Anfwer, 
or fpake with any one there, it muft be with an 
evil Spirit : And then I entred into a long Dif- 
courfe with him about the Devil, the Original of 
him, his Rebellion againft God, his Enmity to 
Man, the Reafon of it, his fetting himfelf up in 
the dark Parts of the World to be Worfhip'd in- 
ftead of God, and as God ; and the jnany Strata- 

S gems 



[»5«] 



gems he made ufe of to delude Mankind to his 
Ruine ; how he had a fecret accefs to our Paflions, 
and to our affe&ions, to adapt his Snares fo to our 
Inclinations, as to caufe us even to be our own 
Tempters, and to run upon our Deftrudtion by our 
own Choice. 

I found it was not fo eafie to imprint right No- 
tions in his Mind about the Devil, as it was about 
the Being of a God. Nature aflifted all my Argu- 
ments to Evidence to him, even the Neceflity of a 
great firft Caufe and over-ruling governing Power ; 
a fecret directing Providence, and of the Equity, 
and Juftice, of paying Homage to him that made us, 
and the like. But there appeared nothing of all 
this in the Notion of an evil Spirit ; of his Ori- 
ginal, his Being, his Nature, and above all of his 
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do 
fo too ; and the poor Creature puzzl'd me once in 
fuch a manner, by a Queftion meerly natural and 
innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to him. 
I had been talking a great deal to him of the Pow- 
er of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful Nature 
to Sin, his being a confuming Fire to the Workers 
of Iniquity ; how, as he had made us all, he 
could deftroy us and all the World in a Moment ; 
and he liften'd with great Serioufnefs to me all the 
while. 

After this, I had been telling him how the De- 
vil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and 
ufed all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good 
Defigns of Providence, and to ruine the Kingdom 
of Chrift in the World ; and the like. Wellj fays 
Friday, but you fay, God is fo ftrong, fo great, 
is he not much ftrong, much might as the Devil ? 
Yes, yes, fays I, Friday ', God is ftronger than the 
Devil, God is above the Devil, and therefore we 
pray to God to, tread him down under our Feet, 
" * • and 



I>59] 



.and enable us to refift his Temptations and 
-quench his fiery Darts. But, fays he again, if 
God much ftrong, much might as the Devil, why God no 
-Ml the Devil, fo make him no more do wicked? 

I was ftrangely furpriz'd at his Queftion, and 
after all, tho* I was now an old Man, yet I was 
"but a young Do&or, and ill enough quallified for 
a Cafuift, or a Solver of Difficulties : And at firft 
I could not tell what to fay, fo I pretended not to 
hear him, and ask'd him what he faid ? But he 
was too earneft for an Anfwer to forget his Quefti- 
on ; fo that he repeated it in the very fame broken 
Words, as above. By this time I had recovered 
jny felf a little, and I faid, God will at lajl punijb 
him fever ely ; he is refervdfor the Judgment ', and is 
.to be caft into the Bottomlefs-Pit, to dwell with exer- 
lofting Fire: This did not (atisfie Friday, . but he 
returns upon me, repeating my Words, Reserve, 
at last, me no underftand; but, Why not kill the 
Devil now t not kill great ago ? You may as well ask 
mt,faid I, Why God does not kill you and I, 
when we do wicked Things here that offend him ? 
We are preferv'd to repent and be pardon'd ; He 
mufes a while at this; well, well, fays he, mighty 
affectionately, that well ; fo you, I, Devil, all wick- 
ed, allpreferve, repent, God pardon all. Here I was 
run down again by him to the laft Degree, and it 
was a Teftimony to me, how the meer Notions of 
Nature, though they will guide reafonable Crea- 
tures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Wor- 
(hip or Homage due to the fupreme Being, of God 
as the Confequence of our Nature; yet nothing but 
divine Revelation can from the Knowledge of Je- 
fus Chrifty and of a Redemption purchased for us, of a 
Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Interceflbr, 
at the Foo t-ftool of God's Throne ; I fay, nothing 
but a. Rev elation from Heaven, can form thefe in 

S 2 the 



[a6o] 



the Soul, and that therefore the Gofpel of our 
Lord and Saviour Jefus Cbrift ; I mean, the Word 
of God, and the Spirit of God promis'd for the. 
Guide and Sandlifier of his People, are the abfolute- 
Jy neceflary Inftruftors of the Souls of Men, in the: 
faving Knowledge of God, and the Means of Sal- 
vation. 

I therefore diverted the prefent Difcourfe be- 
tween me and my Man, riling up haftily, as upon 
feme fudden Occafion of going out; then fending, 
him for fbmething a good way off, I ferioufly pray'dr 
to God that he would enable me to inftruft faving- 
ly this poor Savage, affifting by his Spirit the 
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive 
the Light of the Knowledge of God in Cbrift, re- 
conciling him to himfelf, and would guide me to> 
fpeak fo to him from the Word of God, as his. 
Confcience might be convinced, his Eyes open'd v 
and his Soul fav'd. When he came again to me, I 
entred into a long Difcourfe with him upon the 
Subject of the Redemption of Man by the Saviour 
of the World, and of the Dodtrine of the Gofpel 
preach'd from Heaven, viz. of Repentance towards^ 
God, and Faith in our Blefled Lord Jefus. I then 
explain'd to him, as well as I could, why our 
Blefled Redeemer took not on him the Nature of 
Angels, but the Seed of Abraham, and how for 
that Reafon the fallen Angels had no Share in the 
Redemption ; that he came only to the loft Sheep* 
of the Houfe of Ifrael, and the like. 

I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Know- 
ledge, in all the Methods I took for this poor 
Creature's Inftru&ion, and muft acknowledge what 
I believe all that aft upon the fame Principle will 
find, That in laying Things open to him, I really 
inform'd and inftrudted myfelf in many Things, that 
either I did not know, or had not fully confider'd 

before l* 



[26l] 



'before ; but which occurr'd naturally to my Mind, 
upon my fearching into them, for the Information 
of this poor Savage : and I had more Affe&ion in 
my Enquiry after Things upon this Occafion, than 
<ever I felt before ; fo that whether this poor wild 
Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great 
Reafon to be thankful that ever he came to me : 
(My Grief fet lighter upon me, my Habitation 
'grew comfortable to me beyond Meafure ; and 
when I reflefted that in thi$ folitary Life which I 
had been confin'd to, I had not only been moved my 
ifelf to look up to Heaven, and to feek to the Hand 
that had brought me there ; but was now to be 
;made an Inftrument under Providence to fave the 
Life, and for ought I knew, the Soul of a poor Sa- 
vage, and bring him to the true Knowledge of 
Religion, and of the Chriftian Do&rine, that he 
might know Chrift Jefus, to know whom is Life eter- 
nal. I fey, when I refle&ed upon all thefe Things, 
a (ecret Joy run through every Part of my Soul, and 
I frequently rejoyc'd that ever I was brought to 
this Place, which I had fo often thought the moft 
dreadful of all Afflictions that could poffibly have 
ibefallen me. 

In this thankful Frame I continued all the Re- 
mainder of my Time, and the Converfation which 
employ'd the Hours between Friday and I, was 
;fuch, as made the three Years which we liv'd there 
together perfectly and compleatly happy, ifanyjuch 
Thing as compleat Happinefs can be farm d in afublu- 
nary State. The Savage was now a good Chrifti- 
an, a much better than I; though I have reafon to 
hope, and blefe God for it, that we were equally 
penitent, and comforted reftor'd Penitents; we 
had here the Word of God to read, and no farther 
off from his Spirit to inftrudfc, than if we had been 
in England. 

S3 I always 



[ 262] 



I always apply *d my felf in Reading the Scrip- 
ture, to let him know, as well as I could, the 
Meaning of what I read ; and he again, by his fe- 
rious Enquiries, and Queftionings, made me, as I 
[aid before > a much better Scholar in the Scripture 
Knowledge, than I fhould ever have been by my 
own private meer Reading. Another thing I can- 
not refrain from obferving here alfo from Experi- 
ence, in this retir'd Part of my Life, viz. How in- 
finite, and inexpreflible a Blefling it is, that the 
Knowledge of God, and of the Doftrine of Salva- 
tion by Chrift Jejus> is fo plainly laid down in the 
Word of God ; fo eafy to be receiv'd and under- 
ftood: That as the bare reading the Scripture- 
made me capable of underftanding enough of 
my Duty, to carry me diredly on to the great 
Work of fincere Repentance for my Sins, and lay- 
ing hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a. 
ftated Reformation in Pradlice, and Obedience to 
all God's Commands, and this without any Teach- 
er or Inftrufter ; I mean, humane ; fo the fame 
plain Inftruftion fufficiently ferv'd to the enlight- 
ning this Savage Creature, and bringing him td 
be uich a Chriftian, as I have known few equal to 
him in my Life. 

As to all the Difputes, Wranglings, Strife and" 
Contention, which has happen 'd in the World about 
Religion, whether Niceties inDodrines, or Schemes 
of Church Government, they were all perfectly ufe- 
lefs to us ; as for ought I can yet fee, they have 
been to all the reft of the World: We had thtfure 
Guide to Heaven, viz. The Word of God; and we 
had, blejfed be God, comfortable Views of the Spi- 
rit of God teaching and inftruding us by his Word,. 
leading us into all Truths and making us both wil- 
ling and obedient to the Inftru&ion of his Word*, 
and I cannot fee the leaft Ufe that the greatefif 

Knowledge: 



C *% ] 



Knowledge of the difputed Points in Religion 
which have made fuch Confufions in the World 
would have been to us, if we could have ob- 
tain'd it; but I muft go on with the Hiftorical Part 
of Things, and take every Part in its order. 

After Friday and I became more intimately ac- 
quainted, and that he could underftand almoft all 
I faid to him, and fpeak fluently, though in broken 
Englijh tome; I acquainted him with my own Sto- 
ry, or at lead fo much of it as related to my coming 
into the Place, how I had liv'd there, and how long. 
I let him into the Myftery, for fuch it was to him, 
of Gunpowder, and Bullet, and taught him how to 
fhoot : I gave him a Knife, which he was wonder- 
fully delighted with, and I made him a Belt, with a 
Frog hanging to it, fuch as in England we wear 
Hangers in; and in the Frog, inftead of a Hanger, 
I gave him a Hatchet, which was not only as good 
a Weapon in fome Cafes, but much more ufeful up- 
on other Occasions. 

I defcrib'd to him the Country of Europe, and 
particularly England, which I came from; how we 
liv'd, how we worfhipp'd God, how we behav'd 
to one another; and how we traded in Ships to all 
Parts of the World : I gave him an Account of the 
Wreck which I had been on board of, and fhew'd 
him as near as I could, the Place where fhe lay ; but 
flie was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone 

I fhew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we 
loft when we efcap'd, and which I could not ftir 
with my whole Strength then ; but was now fallen 
almoft all to Pieces : Upon feeing this Boat, Friday 
ftood mufing a great while, and faid nothing; I 
ask'd him what it was he ftudy'd upon, at laft fays 
he, meifeefucb Boat like come to Place at my Nation. 

I did not underftand him a good while ; but at 
laft, when I had examin'd farther into it, I under- 

S 4 ftood 



[»6 4 ] 



flood by him, that a Boat, fuch as that had been, 
came on Shore upon the Country where he liv'd ; 
that is, as he explain'd it, was driven thither by 
Strefs of Weather : I prefently imagin'd, that fome 
European Ship muft have been caft away upon their 
Coaft, and the Boat might get loofe, and drive a 
Shore; but was fo dull, that I never once thought 
of Men making efcape from a Wreck thither, much 
lefs whence they might come ; fb I only enquir'd af- 
ter a Defcription of the Boat. 

Friday defcrib'd the Boat to me well enough ; but 
brought me better to underftand him, when he ad- 
ded with fome Warmth, wefave the white Mans from 
drown : Then I prefently ask'd him, if there was a- 
ny white Mans, as he call'd them, in the Boat ; yes, 
he faid, the Boat full white Mans: I ask'd him how 
many ; he told upon his Fingers feventeen : I ask'd 
him then what become of them ; he told me, they 
live y they dwell at my Nation. 

This put new Thoughts into my Head ; for I 
prefently imagin'd, that thefe might be the Men 
belonging to the Ship, that was caft away in Sight 
of my I/land, as I now call it ; and who after the 
Ship was ftruck on the Rock, and they faw her in- 
evitably loft, had (av'd themfelves in their Boat, 
and were landed upon that wild Shore among the 
Savages. 

Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically, 
What was become of them ? He aflur'd me they li- 
ved ftill there; that they had been there about four 
Years ; that the Savages let them alone, and gave 
them Viftuals to live. I ask'd him, How it came 
to pafs they did not kill them and eat them ? He 
faid, No, they make Brother with them; that is, as I 
underftood him, a Truce : And then he added, They 
no eat Mans but when makes the War fight ; that is to 



!>6 5 1 



fay, they never eat any Men but fuch as come to 
fight with them, and are taken in Battle. 

It was after this fome considerable Time, that 
being upon the Top of the Hill, at the Eaft Side 
of the Ifland, frojn whence as I have faid, I had 
in a clear Day difcover'd the Main, or Continent 
of America ; Friday, the Weather being very ferene, 
looks very earneftly towards the Main Land, and 
in a kind of Surprife, falls a jumping and dancing, 
and calls out to me, for I was at Tome Diftance 
from him: I ask'd him, What was the Matter? 
Ojoy! Says he, O glad 7 There fee my Country, there 
my Nation! 

I obferv'd an extraordinary Senfe of Pleafure ap- 
pear'd in his Face, and his Eyes fparkled, and his 
Countenance difcover'd a ftrange Eagernefs, as if 
he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; 
and this Obfervation of mine, put a great many 
Thoughts into me, which made me at firft not fo 
eafy about my new Man Friday as I was before ; 
and I made no doubt, but that if Friday could get 
back to his own Nation again, he would not only 
forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to 
me; and would be forward enough to give his 
Countrymen an Account of me, and come back per- 
haps with a hundred or two of them, and make a 
Feaft ypon me, at which he might be as merry as 
he us'd to be with thofe of his Enemies, when 
they were taken in War. 

But I wrong'd the poor honeft Creature very 
much, for which I was very forry afterwards. 
However as my Jealoufy encreafed, and held me 
fome Weeks, I was a litde more circumfpedt, and 
not fo familiar and kind to him as before; in 
which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the ho- 
neft grateful Creature having no thought about it, 
but what confifted with the beft Principles, both 

as 



[266] 



as a religious Chriftian, and as a grateful Friend, 
as appeared afterwards to my full Satisfaction. 

While my Jealoufy of him lafted, you may be fure 
I was every Day pumping him to fee if he would 
difcover any of the new Thoughts, which I fuf- 
pefted were in him ; but I found every thing he 
faid was fo Honeft, and fo Innocent, that I could 
find nothing to nourifli my Sufpicion ; and in 
fpight of all my Uneafinefe he made me at laft en- 
tirely his own again, nor did he in the leaft per- . 
ceive that I was Uneafie, and therefore I could not 
fufpedl him of Deceit. 

One Day walking up the fame Hill, but the 
Weather being haizy at Sea, fo that we could not 
fee the Continent, I calTd to him, and faid, Fri- 
day, do not you wifti your felf in your own Coun- 
try, your own Nation ? Yes, he faid, be be much O 
glad to be at bis own Nation. What would you do 
there faid I, would you turn Wild again, eat Mens 
Flefh again, and be a Savage as you were before. 
He lookt full of Concern, and (baking his Head 
faid, No no, Friday tell them to live Good, tell them 
to pray God, tell them to eat Corn bread, Cattle-flejb, 
Milk, no eat Man again : Why then faid I to him, 
They will kill yon. He look'd grave at that, and 
then faid, No, they no kill me, they willing love learn : 
He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. 
He added, they learned much of the Bearded-Mans 
that come in the Boat. Then I as'd him if he 
would go back to them? Hefmil'd at that, and 
told me he could not fwim fo far. I told him I 
would make a Canoe for him. He told me, be 
would go, if I would go with him. I go ! fays I, why 
they will Eat me if I come there? No, no, (ays 
he, me make tbey no Eat you ; me make tbey muck Love 
you: He meant he would tell them how I had 
kill'd his Enemies, and fav'd his Life, and fo he 

would 



[ a«70 

would make them love me ; then he told me as- 
well as he could, how kind they were to feventeen 
White-men, or Bearded-men, as he call'd them,, 
who came on Shore there in Diftrefe. 

From this time I confefe I had a Mind ta 
venture over, and fee if I could poflible joyn with 
thefe Bearded-men, who I made no doubt were 
Spaniards or Portuguefe ; not doubting but if I could 
we might find fome Method to Efcape from 
thence, being upon the Continent, and a good 
Company together ; better than I could from an 
Ifland 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without 
Help, So after fome Days I took Friday to work 
again, by way of Difcourfe, and told him I would 
give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation 1 
and accordingly I carry *d him to my Frigate 
which lay on the other Side of the Ifland, and ha- 
ving clear 'd it of Water, for I always kept it funk 
in the Water ; I brought it out, fhewed it him,, 
and we both went into it. 

I found he was a moft dextrous Fellow at ma- 
naging it, would make it go almoft as fwift and 
faft again as I could; fo when he was in, I faid to 
him, Well now, Friday, fhall we go to your Nati- 
on ? He look'd very dull at my laying fo, which it 
feems was, because he thought the Boat too fmall 
to go fo far. I told him then I had a bigger ; fo 
the next Day I went to the Place where the.firft 
Boat lay which I had made, but which I could not 
get into Water ; He faid that was big enough ; but 
then as I had taken no Care of it, and it had lain 
two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun had 
fplit and dry'd it, that it was in a manner rotten. 
Friday told me fuch a Boat would do very well, and 
would carry much enough Vittle, Drink, Bread, that 
was his Way of Talking. 

Upon 



[268] 



i 



Upon the whole, I was by this Time fo fix'd 
upon my Defign of going over with him to the 
Continent, that I told him we would go and make 
-one as big as that, and he fhould go home in it. 
He anfwer^d not one Word, but look'd very grave 
and fad : I ask'd him what was the matter with 
him ? He ask'd me again thus ; Why, you angry mad 
with Friday, what me done? I ask'd him what he 
meant; I told him I was not angry with him at all. 
No angry! No angry! fays he, repeating the Words 
feveral Times, Why Jend Friday home away to my 
Nation? Why, (fays I) Friday, did you not fay you 
wifli'd you were there ? Yes, yes, fays he, wijh be both 
there, no wijh Friday there, no Mafter there. In a 
Word, he would not think of going there without 
me ; I go there ! Friday, (fays I) what Jhall I do 
there? He turn'd very quick upon me at this : You do 
great deal much good, fays he, you teach wild Mans be 
goodfober tame Mans; you tell them know God, pray 
God, and live new Life. Alas! Friday, (fays I) 
thou knoweft not what thou fay eft, lam but an ignorant 
Man my self Yes, yes, fays he, you teacbee me Good, 
you teachee them Good. No, no, Friday, (fays I) you 
Jhall go without me, leave me hereto live by my f elf, as I 
did before. He look'd confus'd again at that Word, 
and running to one of the Hatchets which he ufed 
to wear, he takes it up haftily, comes and gives it 
me, What mu ft I do with this? fays I to him. Tou 
take, kill Friday; (fays he.) What muft I kill you 
for ? faid I again. He returns very quick, What you 
fend Friday away for ? take, kill Friday, no fend Fri- 
day away. This he {poke fo earneftly, that I faw 
Tears ft and in his Eyes : In a Word, I fo plainly 
difcover'd the utmoft Affedtion in him to me, and 
a firm Refolution in him, that I told him then, and 
often after, that I would n»ever fend him away 
from me, if he was willing to ftay with me. 

Upon 



[a6 9 ] 



Upon the whole, as I found by all his Difcourfe 
a fettled Affe&ion to me, and that nothing fhould 
part him from me, fo I found all the Foundation 
of his Defire to go to his own Country, was laid 
in his ardent Affe&ion to the People, and his Hopes- 
of my doing them good ; a Thing which as I had 
no Notion of my felf, fo I had not the leaft Thought 
or Intention, or Defire of undertaking it But ftill 
I found a ftrong Inclination to my attempting an 
Efcape as above, founded on the Suppofition ga- 
therd from the Difcourfe, (viz.) That there were 
feventeen bearded Men there; and therefore, with- 
out any more Delay, I went to Work with Friday 
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a 
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage.. 
There were Trees enough in the Ifland to have 
built a little Fleet, not of Periagua's and Canoes, 
but even of good large Veflels. But the main Thing 
I look'd at, was to get one fo near the Water that 
we might launch it when it was made, to avoid 
the Miftake I committed at firft. 

At laft, Friday pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found 
he knew much better than I what kind of Wood was 
fitteft for it, nor can I tell to this Day what Wood 
to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was 
very like the Tree we call Fujlic> or between that 
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the 
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the 
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for 
a Boat. But I fhew'd him how rather to cut it out 
with Tools, which, after I had fhew'd him how 
to ufe, he did very handily, and in about a Month's 
hard Labour, we finifhed it, and made it very 
handfome, efpecially when with our Axes, which I 
ihew'd Jiim how to handle, we cut and hew'd the 
out-fide into the true Shape of a Boat; after this, 
however, it coft us near a Fortnight's Time to get 

her, 



[ *7° ] 



her along as it were Inch by Inch upon great Rowl- 
ers into the Water. But when flie was in, fhe 
would have carry'd twenty Men with great 
Eafe. 

When flie was in the Water, and tho' flie was fo 
big it amazed me to fee with what Dexterity and 
how fwift my Man Friday would manage her, turn 
her, and paddle her along; fo I ask'd him if he 
would, and if we might venture over in her; Tes, he 
faid, be venture over in her very well, the? great blow 
Wind. However, I had a farther Defign that he 
knew nothing of, and that was to make a Maft and 
Sail and to fit her with an Anchor and Cable : As to 
a Maft, that was eafy enough to get ; fo I pitch'd 
upon a ftrait young Cedar-Tree, which I found 
near the Place, and which there was great Plenty 
of in the Ifland, and I fet Friday to Work to cut it 
down, and gave him Directions how to fhape and 
order it. But as to the Sail, that was my particu- 
lar Care; I knew I had old Sails, or rather Pieces of 
old Sails enough ; but as I had had them now fix and 
twenty Years by me, and had not been very careful 
to prefer ve them, not imagining that I fliould ever 
have this kind of Ufe for them, I did not doubt but 
they were all rotten, and indeed moft of them were 
fo ; however, I found two Pieces which appear'd 
pretty good, and with thefe I went to Work, and 
with a great deal of Pains, and awkward tedious 
ftitching (you may be fure^ for Want of Needles, 
I at length made a three Corner'd ugly Thing, like 
what we call in Eng land, a Shoulder of Mutton 
Sail, to go with a Boom at bottom, and a little 
fliort Sprit at the Top, fuch as ufually our Ship's 
Long-Boats fail with, and fuch as I beft knew how to 
manage ; becaufe it was fuch a one. as I had to the 
Boat, in which I made my Efcape from Bartiary, as 
delated in the firft Part of my Story. 

I was 



07 1 ] 



I was near two Months performing this laft 
Work, viz. rigging and fitting my Maft and Sails ; 
for I finiih'd them very compleat, making a fmall 
Stay, and a Sail, or Forefail to it, to affift, if we fhould 
turn to Windward ; and which was more than all, 
I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern of her, to fteer with ; 
and though I was but a bungling Shipwright, yet 
as I knew the Ufefulneis, and even Neceffity of 
fuch a Thing, I apply 'd my felf with fo much Pains 
to do it, that at laft I brought it to pafs ; though 
confidering the many dull Contrivances I had 
for it that fail'd, I think it coft me almoft as much 
Labour as making the Boat. 

After all this was done too, I had my Man Fri- 
day to teach as to what belong'd to the Navigation of 
jny Boat; for though he knew very well how to 
paddle a Canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to 
a Sail, and a Rudder ; and was the moil amaz'd, 
when he few me work the Boat too and again in the 
Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb'd, and 
fill'd this way, or that way, as the Courfe we fail'd 
chang'd ; I fay, when he faw this, he ftood like one, 
aftonifh'd, and amaz'd : However, with a little 
Ufe, I made all thefe Things familiar to him ; and 
he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the 
Compafs, I could make him underftand very little 
of that. On the other hand, as there was very little 
cloudy Weather, and feldom or never any Fogs in 
thofe Parts, there was the lefs occafion for a Com- 
pafs, feeing the Stars were always to be feen by 
Night, and the Shore by Day, except in the rainy 
Seafons, and then no body car 'd to . ftir abroad, ei- 
ther by Land or Sea. 

I was now entred on the feven and twentieth 
Year of my Captivity in this Place ; though the 
three laft Years that I had this Creature with me, 
ought rather to be left out of the Account, my Ha- 
bitation 



[ 2 7 2 ] 



bitation being quite of another kind than in all the 
reft of the Time. I kept the Anniverfary of my 
Landing here with the fame Thankfulnefs to God 
for his Mercies, as at firft ; and if I had fuch Caufe 
of Acknowledgment at firft, I had much more fo 
now, having fuch additional Teftimonies of the 
Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes 
I had of being effeftually, and fpeedily deliver'd ; 
for I had an invincible Impreflion upon my 
Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and 
that I fhould not be another Year in this Place t 
However, I went on with my Husbandry, digging, 
planting, fencing, as ufual ; I gather'd and cur'd m y 
Grapes, and did every neceflary Thing as before. 

The rainy Seafon was in the mean Time upon 
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other 
Times ; fo I had ftow'd our new Veflel as fecure as 
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where as 
I faid, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from 
the Ship, and haling her up to the Shore, at high 
Water mark, I made my Man Friday dig a litde 
Dock, juft big enough to hold her, and juft deep e- 
nough to give her Water enough to fleet in ; and 
then when the Tide was out, we made a ftrong 
Dam crofs the End of it, to keep the Water out ;. 
and fo (he lay dry, as to the Tide from the Sea ; 
and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many 
Boughs of Trees, fo thick, that fhe was as well 
thatch'd as a Houfe; and thus we waited for the 
Month of November and December, in which I de- 
fign'd to make my Adventure. 

When the fettled Seafon began to come in, as 
the thought of my Defign return'd with the fail 1 
Weather, I was preparing daily for the Voyage ; 
and the firft Thing I did, was to lay by a certain 
Quantity of Provifions, being the Stores for our 
Voyage ; and intended in a Week or a Fortnight's 

Time,. 



I 2 73] 



Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boat. 
I was bufy one Morning upon fome Thing of this 
kind, when I call'd to Friday , and bid him go to the 
Sea Shore, and fee if he could find a Turtle, or 
Tortoife, a Thing which we generally got once a 
Week, for the Sake of the Eggs, as well as the 
Flefti : Friday had not been long gone, when he 
came running back, and flew over my outer Wall, 
or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the 
Steps he fct his Feet on; and before I had time to 
fpeak to him, he cries out to me, O Mafter ! O Ma- 
fter! O Sorrow! O bad! What's the Matter, Friday, 
fays I; O yonder, there, fays he, one, two, three Canoe! 
one, two, three! By his way of fpeaking, I conclu- 
ded there were fix ; but on enquiry, I found it was 
but three: Well, Friday, fays I, do not be frighted; 
4b I heartned him up as well as I could : However, 
I faw the poor Fellow was moft terribly fcar'd ; for 
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to 
look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat 
him; and the poor Fellow trembled fo, that I 
fcarce knew what to do with him : I comforted him 
as well as I could, and told him I was in as much 
Danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as 
him ; but, fays I, Friday, we muft refohe to fight them; 
Can you fight, Friday? Me /hoot, fays he, but there 
come many great Number. No matter for that, faid 
I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not 
kill ; fo I ask'd him, Whether if I refolv'd to defend 
him, he would defend me, and ftand by me, and do 
juftas I bid him? He faid, Me die, wbenyou bid die, 
Mafter ; fo I went and fetch 'd a good Dram of 
Rum, and gave him; for I had been fo good a Hus- 
band of my Rum, that I had a great deal left: 
When he had drank it, I made him take the two 
Fowling-Pieces, which we always carry'd, and load 
them with large Swan-Shot, as big as fmall Piftol 

T Bullets ; 



[ 2 74] 



Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded them 
with two Slugs, and five fmall Bullets each ; and 
my two Piftols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets 
each ; I hung my great Sword as ufual, naked by 
my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet. 

When I had thus prepar'd my felf, I took my Per- 
fpedtive-Glafs, and went up to the Side of the Hill, 
to fee what I could difcover; and I found quickly, 
by my Glafs, that there were one and twenty Sava- 
ges, three Prisoners, and three Canoes ; and that their 
whole Bufinefs feem'd to be the triumphant Ban- 
quet upon thefe three humane Bodies, (a barbarous 
Feaft indeed) but nothing elfe more than as I had 
obferv'd was ufual with them. 

I obferv'd alfo, that they were landed not where 
they had done, when Friday made his Efcape ; but 
nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and 
where a thick Wood came clofe almoft down to the 
Sea : This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane 
Errand thefe Wretches came about, filTd me with 
fuch Indignation, that I came down again to Friday, 
and told him, I was refolv'd to go down to them, 
and kill them all ; and ask'd him, If he would (land 
by me ? He was now gotten over his Fright, and 
his Spirits being a little rais'd, with the Dram I had 
given him, he was very chearful, and told me, as 
before, be would die, when I bid die. 

In this Fit of Fury, I took firft and divided the 
Arms which I had charg'd, as before, between us ; 
I gave Friday one Piftol to ftick in his Girdle, and 
three Guns upon his Shoulder ; and I took one Pi- 
ftol, and the other three my felf; and in this Po- 
fture we march'd out : I took a fmall Bottle of Rum 
in my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag, with 
more Powder and Bullet; and as to Orders, I 
charg'd him to keep clofe behind me, and not to 
ftir, or (hoot, or do any Thing, till I bid him ; and 

in 



[>75 ] 



in the mean Time, not to fpeak a Word : In this 
Pofture I fetch'd a Compafs to my Right-Hand, of 
near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to get 
into the Wood ; fo that I might come within (hoot 
-of them, before I fhould be difcover'd, which I had 
4een by my Glafs, it was eafy to do. 

While I was making this March, my former 
Thoughts returning, I began to abate my Refolu- 
tion ; I do not mean, that I entertain'd any Fear of 
their Number; for as they were naked, unarm'd 
Wretches, 'tis certain I was fuperior to them ; nay, 
though I had been alone; but it occurr'd to my 
Thoughts, What Call ? What Occafion- ? much 
4els, What Neceflity I was in to go and dip my 
Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither 
-done, or intended me any Wrong? Who as to me 
were innocent, and whofe barbarous Cuftoms were 
their own Difafter, being in them a Token indeed 
of God's having left them, with the other Nations 
of that Part of the World, to fuch Stupidity, and 
to fuch inhumane Courfes ; but did not call me to 
take upon me to be a Judge of their Aftions, much 
lefs an Executioner of his Juftice ; that whenever 
lie thought fit, he would take the Caufe into his 
own Hands, and by national Vengeance punifti 
them as a People, for national Crimes ; but that 
in the mean time, it was none of my Bufinefs ; that 
it was true, Friday might juftify it, becaufe he was 
a declared Enemy, and in a State of War with thofe 
very particular People ; and it was lawful for him 
to attack them ; but I could not fay the fame with 
refpeft to me: Thefe Things were fo warmly 
prefs'd upon my Thoughts, all the way as I went, 
that I refblv'd I would only go and place my felf 
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous 
Feaft, and that I would aft then as God (hould di~ 
reft but that unlefs fomething offer'd that was 

T 2 more 



[a 7 6] 



more a Call to me than yet I knew of, I would not 
meddle with them. 

With this Refolution I enter'd the Wood, and 
with all poflible Warynefs and Silence, Friday fol- 
lowing clofe at my Heels, I march'd till I came 
to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was. 
next to them ; only that one Corner of the Wood 
lay between me and them ; here I call'd foftly to 
Friday r , and fhewing him a great Tree, which was- 
juft at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go ta* 
the Tree, and bring me Word if he could fee there 
plainly what they were doing ; he did fo, and came 
immediately back to me, and told me they might 
be plainly view'd there ; that they were all about 
their Fire, eating the Flefti of one of their Prifo- 
ners ; and that another lay bound upon the Sand,, 
a little from them, which he faid they would kill 
next, and which fir'd all the very Soul within me;, 
he told me it was not one of their Nation ; but one 
of the bearded Men, who he had told me of, that 
came to their Country in the Boat: I was fill'd. 
with Horror at the very naming the white-bearded 
Man, and going to the Tree, I faw plainly by my 
Glafs, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of" 
the Sea, with his. Hands and his Feet ty'd, with 
Flags, or Things like Rufhes ; and that he was an. 
European, and had Cloaths on. 

There was another Tree, and a little Thicketr 
beyond it, about fifty Yards nearer to them than the 
Place where I was, which by going a little way 
about, I (aw I might come at undi&over'd, and 
that then I fhould be within half Shot of them ; fo 
I with-held my Paffion, though I was indeed en- 
rag'd to the higheft Degree, and going back about 
twenty Paces, I got behind lome Bufhes, which held 
all the way, till I came to the other Tree ; and then 
I came to a litde rifing Ground, which gave me a- 

folL 



I>77] 



•full View of them, at the Diftance of about eigh- 
ty Yards. 

I had now not a Moment to loofe ; for nineteen 
of the dreadful Wretches fat upon the Ground, all 
-clofe huddled together, and had juft fent the other 
two to butcher the poor Chriftian, and bring him 
iperhaps Limb by Limb to their Fire, and they 
were ftoop'd down to untie the Bands, at his Feet ; 
I turn'd to Friday \ now Friday, faid I, do as I bad 
thee ; Friday faid he would ; then Friday, fays I, 
.do exaftly as you fee me do, fail in nothing; fo I 
•fet down one of the Muskets, and the Fowling- 
Piece, upon the Ground, and Friday did the like 
by his; and with the other Musket, I took my' 
aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like ; then 
-asking him, If he was ready ? He faid, yes, then 
iire at them, (aid I; and the fame Moment I 
fir'd alfo. 

Friday took his Aim fo much better than I, that 
on the Side that he fhot, he kilTd two of them, 
and wounded three more ; and on my Side, I kilFd 
one, and wounded two : There were, you may be 
fure, in a dreadful Confternation ; and all of them, 
who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feet, 
but did not immediately know which way to run, 
or which way to look; for they knew not from 
whence their Deftruftion came : Friday kept his 
Eyes clofe upon me, that as I had bid him, he 
might obferve what I did ; fo as foon as the firft 
Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took 
tip the Fowling-Piece, and Friday did the like ; he 
fee me cock, and prefent, he did the fame again ; 
Are you ready ? Friday, faid I ; yes, fays he ; let 
fly then, fays I, in the Name of God, and with 
that I fir'd again among the amaz'd Wretches, and 
fo did Friday ; and as our Pieces were now loaden 
•with what I call'd Swan-Shot, or fmall Piftol Bul- 

T 3 lets 



[a 7 8] 



lers, we found only two drop; but fo many were- 
wounded, that they run about yelling, and stream- 
ing, like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miferably 
wounded, moft of them ; whereof three more fell 
quickly after, though not quite dead. . 

Now Friday, fays I, laying down the difcharg'd 
Pieces, and taking up the Musket, which was yet 
loaden ; follow me, fays I, which he did, with a 
great deal of Courage ; upon which I rufh'd out of" 
the Wood, and fhew'd my felf, and Friday clofe at 
my Foot ; as foon as I perceiv'd they faw me, I 
fhouted as loud as I could, and bad Friday do fo 
too ; and running as faft as I could, which by the 
way, was not very faft > being loaden with Arms as I 
was, I made dire&Iy towards the poor Vi&im* 
who was, as I faid, lying upon the Beach, or Shore, 
between the Place where they fat, and the Sea;, 
the two Butchers who were juft going to work 
with him, had left him, at the Suprize of our firft 
Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright, to the Sea Side, 
and had jump'd into a Canoe, and three more of the 
reft made the fame way ; I turn'd to Friday, and bid 
him ftep forwards, and fire at them ; he under- 
ftood me immediately, and running about forty 
Yards, to be near them, he fhot at them, and I 
thought he; had kill'd them all ; for I fee them all 
fall of a Heap into the Boat ; though I faw two of 
them up again quickly : However, he kill'd two- 
of them, and wounded the third ; fo that he lay 
down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had 
been dead. 

While my Man Friday fir'd at them, I pulTd out 
my Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor 
Viftim, and loofing his Hands, and Feets, I lifted 
him up, and ask'd him in the Portuguefe Tongue,. 
What he was? He anfwer'd in Latin, Cbriftianus; 
but was fo weak, and faint, that he courfe fcarce- 

ftand, 



I>79] 



Hand, or {peak ; I took my Bottle out of my Poc- 
ket, and gave it him, making Signs that he fhould 
drink, which he did ; and I gave him a Piece of 
Bread, which he eat; then I ask'd him, What 
Countryman he was ? And he faid, Efpagniole ; and 
being a little recover'd, let me know by all the 
Signs he could poflibly make, how much he was 
in my Debt for his Deliverance ; Seignior •, faid I, 
with as much Spanijh as I could make up, we will 
talk afterwards ; but we muft fight now ; if you 
have any Strength left, take this Piftol, and Sword, 
and lay about you ; he took them very thankfully, 
and no (boner had he the Arms in his Hands, but 
as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew 
upon his Murtherers, like a Fury, and had cut two 
of them in Pieces, in an inftant ; for the Truth is, 
as the whole was a Surprize to them; lb the poor 
Creatures were fo much frighted with the Noife of 
our Pieces, that they fell down for meer Amaze- 
ment, and Fear; and had no more Power to at- 
tempt their own Efcape, than their Flelh had to 
refift our Shot ; and that was the Cafe of thofe Five 
that Friday {hot at in the Boat; for as three of 
them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd ; fo the o- 
ther two fell with the Fright 

I kept my Piece in my Hand ftill, without firing, 
being willing to keep my Charge ready ; becaufe I 
had given the Spaniard my Piftol, and Sword ; fo I 
call'd to Friday, and bad him run up to the Tree, 
from whence we firft fir'd, and fetch the Arms 
which lay there, that had been difcharg'd, which 
he did with great Swiftnefs ; and then giving him 
my Musket, I fat down my felf to load all the reft 
again, and bad them come to me when they want- 
ed : While I was loading thefe Pieces, there hap- 
pen'd a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard, 
and one of the Savages, who made at him with one of 

T 4 their 



[280] 



their great wooden Swords, the fame Weapon that 
was to have kill'd him before, if I had not prevent- 
ed it : The Spaniard, who was as bold, and as brave 
as could be imagined, though weak, had fought 
this Indian a good while, and had cut him two 
great Wounds on his Head ; but the Savage being 
a ftout lufty Fellow, doling in with him, had 
thrown him down (being faint) and was wringing 
my Sword out of his Hand, when the Spaniard, tho' 
undermoft wifely quitting the Sword, drew the Piftol 
from his Girdle, fhot the Savage through the Body, 
and kill'd him upon the Spot ; before I, who was 
running to help him, could come near him. 

Friday being now left to his Liberty, purfu'd the 
flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand, but 
his Hatchet; and with that he difpatch'd thofe 
three, who, as I {aid before, were wounded at firft 
and fallen, and all the reft he could come up with, 
and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave 
him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he 
purfu'd two of the Savages, and wounded them 
both ; but as he was not able to run, they both got 
from him into the Wood, where Friday purfu'd 
them, and kill'd one of them ; but the other was too 
nimble for him, and though he was wounded, yet 
had plunged himfelf into the Sea, and (warn with 
all his might off to thofe two who were left in the 
Canoe, which three in the Canoe, with one wound- 
ed, who we know not whether he dy'd or no, were 
all that efcap'd our Hands of one and twenty : The 
Account of the Reft is as follows ; 

3 Kill'd at our firft Shot from the Tree. 

2 Kill'd at the next Shot. 

2 Kill'd by Friday in the Boat. 

2 Kill'd by Ditto, of thofe at firft wounded. 

i Kill'd by Ditto, in the Wood. 

3 Kill'd 



[*8i] 



3 Kill'd by the Spaniard. 

4 Kill'd, being found dropp'd here and there of 
their Wounds, or kill'd by Friday in his Chafe 
of them. 

4 Efcap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded if 
not dead. 

2i In all. 



Thofc that were in the Canoe ^ work'd hard to 
get out of Gun-Shot ; and though Friday made two 
or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit 
any of them : Friday would fain have had me took 
one of their Canoes^ and purfu'd them ; and indeed 
I was very anxious about their Efcape, leaft carry- 
ing the News home to their People, they (hould 
come back perhaps with two or three hundred of 
their Canoes^ and devour us by meer Multitude ; fo 
I confented to purfue them by Sea, and running to 
one of their Canoes^ I jump'd in, and bad Friday 
follow me ; but when I was in the Canoe % I was 
furpriz'd to find another poor Creature lye there a- 
live, bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard was, 
for the Slaughter, and almoft dead with Fear, 
not knowing what the Matter was ; for he had not 
been able to look up over the Side of the Boat, he 
was ty'd fo hard, Neck and Heels, and had been ty'd 
fo long, that he had really but little Life in him. 

I immediately cut the twitted Flags, or Rufties, 
which they had bound him with, and would have 
helped him up ; but he could not ftand, or (peak, 
but groan'd moft piteoufly, believing it feems ftill 
that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd. 

When Friday came to him, I bad him fpeak to 
him, and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling 
out my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a 

Dram, 



[28a] 



Dram, which, with the News of his being deli- 
vered, reviv'd him, and he fat up in the Boat ; but 
when Friday came to hear him fpeak, and look in 
his Face, it would have mov'd any one to Tears, 
to have feen how Friday kifs'd him, embrac'd him,, 
hugg'd him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollow'd, jump'd a- 
bout, danc'd, fung, then cry'd again, wrung his 
Hands, beat his own Face, and Head, and then 
fung, and jump'd about again, like a diftradted 
Creature : It was a good while before I could make 
him {peak to me, or tell me what was the Mat- 
ter ; but when he came a little to himfelf, he told 
me, that it was his Father. 

It is not eafy for me to exprefs how it mov'd 
me to fee what Extafy and filial Affeftion had 
work'd in this poor Savage, at the Sight of his Fa- 
ther, and of his being deliver'd from Death ; nor 
indeed can I defcribe half the Extravagancies of 
his Affe&ion after this; for he went into the 
Boat and out of the Boat a great many times : 
When he went in to him, he would fit down by 
him, open his Breaft, and hold his Father's Head 
clofe to his Bofom, half an Hour together, to nou- 
rifh it; then he took his Arms and Ankles, which 
were numb'd and ftiff with the Binding, and chaffed 
and rubbed them with his Hands ; and I perceiv- 
ing what the Cafe was, gave him fome Rum out 
of my Bottle, to rub them with, which did them 
a great deal of Good. 

This Acftion put an End to our Purfuit of the 
Canoe, with the other Savages^ who were now 
gotten almoft out of Sight ; and it was happy for 
us that we did not; for it blew fo hard within 
two Hours after, and before they could be gotten 
a Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing fo 
hard all Night, and that from the North-weft + 
which was againft them, that I could not fuppofe 

their 



[ *»3 ] 



their Boat could live, or that they ever reachM to- 
their own Coaft. 

But to return to Friday > he was fo bufy about 
his Father, that I could not find in my Heart to 
take him off for (bme time : But after I thought 
he could leave him a little, I call'd him to me,, 
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas'd to 
the highest Extream ; then I ask'd him, If he had 
given his Father any Bread ? He fhook his Head, 
and faid, None : Ugly Dog eat all up/elf; fo I gave him 
a Cake ofBread out of a little Pouch I carry'd on 
Purpofe ; I alfo gave him a Dram for himfelf, but 
he would not tafte it, but carry'd it to his Fa- 
ther : I had in my Pocket alfb two or three Bunch- 
es of my Raifins, fo I gave him a Handful of them 
for his Father. He had no fooner given his Fa- 
ther thefe Raifins, but I faw him come out of the 
Boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitch'd„ 
he run at fuch a Rate ; for he was the fwifteft Fel- 
low of his Foot that ever I faw; I fay, he run at 
fuch a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were,, 
in an inftant ; and though I call'd, and hollow'd 
too, after him, it was all one, away he went, and 
in a Quarter of an Hour, I faw him come back a- 
gain, though not fo fall as he went ; and as he 
came nearer, I found his Pace was flacker, becaufe 
he had fomething in his Hand. 

When he came up to me, I found he had been 
quite Home for an Earthen Jugg .or Pot to bring 
his Father fome frefh Water, and that he had got 
two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread : The Bread 
he gave me, but the Water he carry'd to his Father: 
However, as I was very thirfty too, I took a lit- 
tle Sup of it. This Water reviv'd his Father more 
than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him ; for 
he was juft fainting with Thirft. 

When 



r*8 4 ] 



When his Father had drank, I call'd to him to 
know if there was any Water left ; he faid, yes ; 
and I bad him give it to the poor Spaniard, 
who was in as much Want of it as his Father ; 
and I fent one of the Cakes, that Friday brought, 
to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak, and 
was repofing himfelf upon a green Place under the 
Shade of a Tree ; and wfyofe Limbs were alfo very 
ftiff, and very much fwell'd with the rude Bandage 
he had been ty'd with. When I faw that upon Fri- 
day's coming to him with the Water, he fat up and 
drank, and took the Bread, and began to eat, I 
went to him, and gave him a Handful of Raifins; 
he look'd up in my Face with all the Tokens of 
Gratitude and Thankfulnefs, that could appear 
in any Countenance ; but was fo weak, notwith- 
ftanding he had fo exerted himfef in the Fight, that 
he could not ftand up upon his Feet ; he try'd to 
do it two or three times, but was really not able, 
his Ankles were fo fwell'd and fo painful to him ; 
fo I bad him fit ftill, and caufed Friday to rub his 
Ankles, and bathe them with Rum, as he had done 
his Father's. 

I obferv'd the poor affe&ionate Creature every 
two Minutes, or perhaps lefs, all the while he 
was here, turn'd his Head about, to fee if his Fa- 
ther was in the fame Place, and Pofture, as he left 
him fitting ; and at laft he found he was not to 
be feen; at which he ftarted up, and without 
fpeaking a Word, flew with that Swiftnefs to him, 
that one could fearce perceive his Feet to 
touch the Ground, as he went : But when he came, 
he only found he had laid himfelf down to eafe his 
Limbs; fo Friday came back to me prefently, and 
I then fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help 
him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, and 
then he fhould carry him to our Dwelling, where 

I would 



[ a8 S ] 



I would take Care of him : But Friday, a lufty 
ftrong Fellow, took the Sqaniard quite up upon 
his Back, and carry 'd him away to the Boat, and 
fet him down foftly upon the Side or Gunnel of the 
Canoe, with his Feet in the infide of it, and then 
lifted him quite in, and fet him clofe to his Fa- 
ther, and prefently ftepping out again, launched 
the Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore fa- 
fter than I could walk, tho' the Wind blew pret- 
ty hard too ; fo he brought them both fafe into our 
Creek ; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away 
to fetch the other Canoe. As he pafs'd me, I 
fpoke to him, and ask'd him, whither he went, 
he told me, Go fetch more Boat ; fo away he went 
like the Wind ; for fure never Man or Horfe run 
like him, and he had the other Canoe in the Creek, 
almoft as fbon as I got to it by Land ; fo he waft- 
ed me over, and then went to help our new Guefts 
out of the Boat, which he did; but they were 
neither of them able to walk; fo that poor Friday 
knew not what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to Work in my Thought, 
and calling to Friday to bid them fit down on the 
Bank while he came to me, I foon made a Kind 
of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I 
carry'd them up both together upon it between us : 
But when we got them to the outfide of our Wall 
or Fortification, we were at a worfe Lois than be- 
fore ; for it was impoffible to get them over ; and 
I was refolv'd not to break it down : So I fet to 
Work again; and Friday and I, in about 2 Hours 
time, made a very handfom Tent, cover'd with 
old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees, 
being in the Space without our outward Fence, 
and between that and the Grove of young Wood 
which I had planted: And here we made them two 
Beds of fuch things as I had (viz.) of good Rice- 
Straw^ 



[>86] 



Straw, with Blankets laid upon it to lye on, 
and another to coyer them on each Bed. 

My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought my 
felf very rich in Subjefts ; and it was a merry Re- 
flection which I frequently made, How like a King 
I look'd. Firft of all, the whole Country was my 
own meer Property ; fo that I had an undoubted 
Right of Dominion. 2dly % My People were per- 
fectly fubjedted : I was abfolute Lord and Law- 
giver ; they all owed their Lives to me, and were 
ready to lay down their Lives, if there had been Oc- 
cafion of it, for me. It was remarkable too, we had 
but three Subjefts, and they were of three different 
Religions. My Man Friday was a Proteftant, his 
Father was a Pagan and a Cannibal, zn& the Spaniard 
was a Papift : However, I allow'd Liberty of Con- 
fcience throughout my Dominions : But this is by 
the Way. 

As foon as I had fecur'd my two weak refcued 
Prifoners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to 
reft them upon, I began to think of making fome 
Provifion for them : And the firft thing I did, I 
order* d Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt 
a Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, to 
be kill'd, when I cut off the hinder Quarter, and 
chopping it into fmall Pieces, I fet Friday to Work 
to boiling and ftewing, and made them a very 
good Difh, I aflure you, of Flefh and Broth, ha- 
ving put fome Barley and Rice alfo into the 
Broth; and as I cook'd it without Doors, for 
I made no Fire within my inner Wall, fo I carry'd 
it all into the new Tent; and having fet a Table 
there for them, I fat down and eat my own Din- 
ner alfo with them, and, as well as I could, chear'd 
them and encourag'dthem; Friday being my Inter- 
preter, efpeciajly to his Father, and indeed to the 

Spa- 



[a8 7 ] 



Spaniard too; for the Spaniard {poke the Language 
of the Savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather flipped, I order'd 
Friday to take one of the Canoes, and go and 
fetch our Mufkets and other Fire-Arms, which 
for Want of time we had left upon the Place of 
Battle, and the next Day I order'd him to go and 
bury the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay 
open to the Sun, and would prefently be offenfive ; 
and I alfo ordered him to bury the horrid Remains 
of their barbarous Feaft, which I knew were pret- 
ty much, and which I could not think of doing my 
felf ; nay, I could not bear to lee them, if I went 
that Way: All which he punctually performed, 
and defaced the very Appearance of the Savages 
being tfyere ; fo that when I went again, I could 
fcarce know where it was, otherwife than by the 
Corner of the Wood pointing to the Place. 

I then began to enter into a little Converfation 
with my two new Subje&s ; and firft I fet Friday to 
enquire of his Father/what he thought of the Efeape 
of the Savages in that Canoe, and whether we might 
expeft a Return of them with a Power too great for 
us to refill : His firft Opinion was, that the Savages 
in the Boat never could live out the Storm which 
blew that Night they went off, but muft of Necef- 
iity be drowned or driven South to thofe other Shores 
where they were as fure to be devoured as they 
were to be drowned if they were caft away ; but as 
to what they would do if they came fafe on Shore, 
he faid he knew not ; but it was his Opinion that 
they were fo dreadfully frighted with the Manner 
of their being attack'd, the Noife and the Fire, 
that he believed they would tell their People, 
they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not 
by the Hand of Man, and that the two which ap- 
pear 'd, (viz.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly 

Spi- 



[288] 



Spirits or Furies, come down to deftroy them, and 
not Men with Weapons : This he {aid he knew, 
becaufe he heard them all cry out (b in their Lan- 
guage to one another, for it was impoffible to 
them to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and 
fpeak Thunder, and kill at a Diftance without 
lifting up the Hand, as was done now : And this old 
Savage was in the right; for, as I underftood fince by 
other Hands, the Savages never attempted to go o- 
ver to the Ifland afterwards ; they were fo terrified 
with the Accounts given by thofe four Men, (for 
it feems they did efcape the Sea) that they believ'd 
whoever went to that enchanted Ifland would be 
deftroy'd with Fire from the Gods. 

This however I knew not, and therefore was un- 
der continual Apprehenfions for a good while, and 
kept always upon my Guard, me and all my Army ;. 
for as we were now four of us, I would have ven- 
tur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open 
Field at any Time. 

In a little Time, however, no more Canoes ap- 
pearing, the Fear of their Coming wore off, and 
I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage 
to the Main into Confideration, being likewife af- 
fur'd by Friday's Father, that I might depend upon 
good Ufage from their Nation on his Account, if I 
would go. 

But my Thoughts were a little fufpended, when. 
I had a ferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and 
when I underftood that there were fixteen more of 
his Countrymen and Portuguefe, which is near that 
Number, who having been caft away, and made 
their Efcape to that Side, liv'd there at Peace in- 
deed with the Savages, but were very fore put to 
it for Neceflaries, and indeed for Life : I ask'd him 
all the Particulars of their Voyage, and found they 
were a Spanijb Ship bound from the Rio de la Plata 

to 



[*8 9 ] 



to the Havana, being dire&ed to leave their Load- 
ing there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, and 
to bring back what European Goods they could 
meet with there ; that they had five Portuguefe Sea- 
men on Board, who they took out of another 
Wreck ; that five of their own Men were drowned 
when the firft (hip was loft, and that thefe efcaped 
thro* infinite Dangers and Hazards, and arriv'd al- 
moftftarv'd on the Cannibal Coaft, where they ex- 
pefted to have been devour'd every Moment, 

He told me, they had fbme Arms with them, 
but they were perfe&ly ufelefs, for that they had 
neither Powder or Ball, the Wafhing of the Sea ha- 
ving (poiTd all their Powder but a little, which 
they ufed at their firft Landing to provide themfelves 
fome Food. 

I ask'd him what he thought would become of 
them there, and if they had form'd no Defign of 
making any Efcape? He faia, They had man^ 
Confultations about it, but that having neither 
Veffel, or Tools to build one, or Provifions of any 
kind, their Councils always ended in Tears and 
Defpair. 

I ask'd him how he thought they would receive a 
Propofal from me, which might tend towards an Ef- 
cape ? And whether, if they were all here, it might 
not be done ? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd 
moftly their Treachery and ill Ufage of me, if I put 
my Life in their Hands ; for that Gratitude was 
no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man ; nor 
did Men always fquare their Dealings by the O- 
bligations they had receiv'd, fo much as they did 
by the Advantages they expe&ed. I told him it 
would be very hard, that I fhould be the Inftrument 
of their Deliverance, and that they ftiould after- 
wards make me their Prifoner in New Spain y where 
an Englijh Man was certain to be made a Sacri- 

U fice. 



[ 2 9 o] 



fice, what Neceffity, or what Accident foever, 
brought him thither : And that I had rather be de- 
liver'd up to the Savages, and be devourd alive, 
than fall into the mercilefs Claws of the Priefts, and 
be carry'd into the Inquifition. I added, That o- 
therwife I was perfwaded, if they were all here, 
we might, with fo many Hands, build a Bark 
large enough to carry us all away, either to the 
Brafils South-ward, or to the Iflands or Spani/h 
Coaft North-ward : But that if in Requital they 
fhould, when I had put Weapons into their Hands, 
carry me by Force among their own People, I 
might be ill ufed for my Kindnefs to them, and 
make my Cafe worfe than it was before. 

He anfwer'd with a great deal of Candor and 
Ingenuity, That their Condition was fo mifera- 
ble, and they were fo fenfible of it, that he be- 
lieved they would abhor the thought of ufing any 
Man unkindly that fhould contribute to their De- 
liverance ; and that , if I pleafed, he would go to 
them with the old Man, and difcourfe with them 
about it, and return again, and bring me their An- 
fwer : That he would make Conditions with them 
upon their folemn Oath, That they fhould be ab- 
folutely under my Leading, as their Commander 
and Captain ; and that they fhould fwear upon the 
Holy Sacraments and the Gofpel, to be true to me, 
and to go to fuch Chriftian Country, as that I 
fhould agree to, and no other ; and to be directed 
wholly and abfblutely to my Orders, 'till they 
were landed fafely in fuch Country, as I intend- 
ed ; and that he would bring a Contract from them 
under their Hands for that Purpofe. 

Then he told me, he would firft fwear to me 
himfelf, That he would never ftir from me as long 
as he liv'd, 'till I gave him Orders; and that he 
would take my Side to the laft Drop of his Blood, 

*if 



[291 ] 



if there fhould happen the leaft Breach of Faith a- 
mong his Country-men. 

He told me, they were all of them very civil 
honeft Men, and they were under the greateft Di- 
ftrefs imaginable, having neither Weapons or 
Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and 
Difcretion of the Savages ; out of all Hopes of 
ever returning to their own Country; and that 
he was Aire, if I would undertake their Relief, 
they would live and die by me. 

Upon thefe AfTurances, I refolv'd to venture to 
relieve them, if poffible, and to fend the old Savage 
and this Spaniard over to them to treat : But when 
we had gotten all things in a Readinefs to go, the 
Spaniard himfelf ftarted an Objection, which had 
fo much Prudence in it on one hand, and fo much 
Sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but 
be very well fatisfy'd in it; and by his Advice, 
put off the Deliverance of his Comerades, for at 
leaft half a Year. The Cafe was thus : 

He had been with us now about a Month ; du- 
ring which time, I had let him fee in what Man- 
ner I had provided, with the Affiftance of Provi- 
dence, for my fupport ; and he faw evidently what 
Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up ; which as 
it was more than fufficient for my felf, fo it was 
not fufficient, at leaft without good Husbandry, 
for my Family ; now it was encreas'd to Num- 
ber four : But much lefs would it be fufficient, if * 
his Country-men, who were, as he faid, fourteen 
ftill alive, fhould come over. And leaft of all 
fhould it be fufficient to victual our Veflel, if we 
fhould build one, for a Voyage to any of the Chri- 
ftian Colonies of America. So he told me, he thought 
it would be more advifable, to let him and the 
two other, dig and cultivate fome more Land, as 
much as I chuld fpare Seed to fow ; and that we 

U 2 fhould 



[ 2 9 2 ] 

lhould wait another Harveft, that we might have 
a Supply of Corn for his Country-men when they 
fhould come ; for Want might be a Temptation to 
them to difagree, or not to think themfelves deli- 
vered, otherwife than out of one Difficulty into 
another. You know, fays he, the Children of If- 
rael y though they rejoyc'd.at firft for their being 
deliver'd out of Egypt , yet'rebefl'd even againft God 
himfelf that deliver'd them, when they came to 
want Bread in the Wildernefs. 

His Caution was fo feafonable, and his Advice 
fo good, that I could not but be very well pleafed 
with his Propofal, as well as I was (atisfy'd with 
his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us, 
as well as the Wooden Tools we were furnifh'd 
with permitted ; and in about a Month's time, by 
the End of which it was Seed time, we had got- 
ten as much Land cur d and trim'd up, as we fow- 
ed 22 Bufhels of Barley on, and 16 Jarrs of Rice, 
which was in fhort all the Seed we had to fpare ; 
nor indeed did we leave our felves Barley fuffici- 
ent for our own Food, for the fix Months that we 
had to expert our Crop, that is to fay, reckoning 
from the time we fet our Seed afide for fowing; 
for it is not to be fuppofed it is fix Months in 
the Ground in the Country. 

Having now Society enough, and our Number 
being fuflicient to put us out of Fear of the Sava- 
ges, if they had come, unlefs their Number had 
been very great, we went freely all over the Ifland, 
where-ever we found Occafion ; and as here we had 
our Efcape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts, it 
was impoflible, at leaji for me> to have the 
Means of it out of mine ; to this Purpofe, 
I mark'd out feveral Trees which I thought fit for 
our Work, and I fet Friday and his Father to cut- 
ting them down ; and then I caufed the Spaniard^ 

to 



I>93 ] 



to whom I imparted my Thought on that Affair, to 
overfee anddireft their Work. I ftiewed them 
with what indefatigable Pains I had hewed a large 
Tree into fingle Planks, and I caufed them to do 
the like, till they had made about a Dozen large 
Planks of good Oak, near 2 Foot broad, 35 Foot 
long, and from 2 Inches to 4 Inches thick : What 
prodigious Labour it took up, any one may ima- 
gine. 

At the feme time i contrived to encreafe my lit- 
tle Flock of tame Goats as much as I could ; and 
to this Purpoft, I made Friday and the Spaniard 
go out one Day, and my felf with Friday the next 
Day ; for we took our Turns : And by this Means 
w« got above 20 young Kids to breed up with the 
reft; for when-ever we fliot the Dam, we faved 
the Kids, and added them to our Flock : But a- 
bove all, the Seafon for curing the Grapes com- 
ing on, I caufed fuch a prodigious Quantity to be 
hung up in the Sun, that I believe, had we been 
at Alkant, where the Raifins of the Sun are cur'd, 
we could have fiU'd 60 or 80 Barrels ; and thefe 
with our Bread was a great Part of our Food, and 
very good living too, I aflure you ; for it is an ex- 
ceeding nouriftiing Food. 

It was now Harveft, and our Crop in good Or- 
der; it was not the mod plentiful Encreafe I had 
feen in the Ifland, but however it was enough to 
anfwer our End; for from our 22 Buftiels of Bar- 
ley, we brought in and thrafhed out above 220 
Bufhels ; and the like in Proportion of the Rice, 
which was Store enough for our Food to the next 
Harveft, tho f all the 16 Spaniards had been on Shore 
with me ; or if we had been ready for a Voyage, 
it would very plentifully have viftualled our Ship, 
to have carry'd us to any Part of the World, that 
is to fay, of America. 

U 3 When 



[ 2 94 ] 

When we had thus hous'd and fecur'd our Ma- 
gazine of Corn, we fell to Work to • make more 
Wicker Work, (viz.) great Baskets in which we kept 
it ; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexte- 
rous at this Part, and often blam'd me that I did not 
make fome things, for Defence, of this Kind of 
Work ; but I faw no Need of it 

And now having a full Supply of Food for all 
the Guefts I expected, I gave the Spaniard Leave 
to go over to the Main, to fee what he could do 
with thofe he had left behind him there, I gave 
him a ftrift Charge in Writing, Not to bring any 
Man with him, who would not firft {wear in the 
Prefence of himfelf and of the old Savage, That 
he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the 
Perfon he ihould find in the Ifland, who was fo 
kind to fend for them in order to their Delive- 
rance ; but that they would ftand by and defend 
him againft all fuch Attempts, and where-ever 
they went, would be entirely under and fubjedted 
to his Commands ; and that this fhould be put in 
Writing, and figned with their Hands : How we 
were to have this done, when I knew they had nei- 
ther Pen or Ink ; that indeed was a Queftion which 
we never aflced. 

Under thefe Inftru&ions, the Spaniard, and the 
old Savage the Father of Friday, went away in one 
of the Canoes, which they might be faid to come 
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as- 
Prifoners to be devour 'd by the Savages. 

I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock 
on it, and about eight Charges of Powder and 
Ball, charging them to be very good Husbands of 
both, and not to ufe either of them but upon ur- 
gent Occafion. 

This was a chearful Work, being the firft Mea- 
fures ufed by me in view of my Deliverance for 

now 



[>95] 



now 27 Years and fome Days, I gave them Provi- 
fionsof Bread, and of dry 'd Grapes, fufficient for 
themfelves for many Days, arid fufficient for all 
their Country-men for about eight Days time; 
and wifhing them a good Voyage, I fee them go, 
agreeing with them about a Signal they ftiould hang 
out at their Return, by which I fhould know them 
again, when they came back, at a Diftance, before 
they came on Shore, 

They went away with a fair Gale on the Day 
that the Moon was at Full by my Account, in the 
Month of Qftober : But as for an .exaft Reckoning of 
Days, after I had once loft it, I could never recover 
it again ; nor had I kept even the Number of Years 
Co punftually, as to be fure that I was right, tho' 
as it prov'd, when I afterwards examin'd my Ac- 
count, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years. 

It was no lefs than eight Days I had waited for 
them, when a ftrange and unforefeen Accident in- 
terveen'd, of which the like has not perhaps been 
heard of in Hiftory : I was faft afleep in my Hutch 
one Morning, when my Man Friday came running 
in to me, and calTd aloud, Matter, Mafter, they 
are come, they are come. 

I jump'd up, and regardlefs of Danger, I went 
out, as foon as I could get my Cloaths on, thro' 
my little Grove, which by the Way was by this 
time grown to be a very thick Wood ; I fay, re- 
gardlefs of Danger, I went without my Arms, 
which was not my Cuftom to do : But I was fur- 
priz'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I pre- 
sently faw a Boat at about a league and half s Di- 
ftance, (landing in for the Shore, with a Shoulder 
of Mutton Sail, as they call it ; and the Wind blow- 
ing pretty fair to bring them in ; alfo I obferv'd 
prefently, that they did not come from that Side 
which the Shore lay on, but from the Souther- 

U 4 moft 



[2 9 6] 



moft End of the Ifland : Upon this I cali'd Friday 
in, and bid him lie clofe, for thefe were not the 
People we look'd for, and that we might not know 
yet whether they were Friends or Enemies. 

In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Perfpe- 
ftive Glafs, to fee what I could make of them ; 
and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'd up to 
the Top of the Hill, as I ,ufed to do when I was 
apprehenfive of any thing, and to take my View 
the plainer without being difcover'd. 

I had fcarce fet my Foot on the Hill, when my 
Eye plainly difcover'd a Ship lying at an Anchor, 
at about two Leagues and an half's Diftance from 
me South-fouth-eaft, but not above a League and 
an half from the Shore. By my Obfervation it ap- 
peared plainly to be an Englifh Ship, and the Boat 
appear'd to be an Englifh Long-Boat. 

I cannot exprefs the Confuiion I was in, tho' the 
Joy of feeing a Ship, and one who I had Reafon to 
believe was Mann'd by my own Country-men, and 
confequently Friends, was fuch as I cannot de- 
fcribe ; but yet I had ibme fecret Doubts hung a- 
bout me, I cannot tell from whence they cajne, 
bidding me keep upon my Guard. In the firft 
Place, it occurred to me to confider what Bufinefs 
an Engli/h Ship could have in that part of the 
World, fince it was not the Way to or from any 
Part of the World, where the Englijh had any Traf- 
fick ; and I knew there had been no Storms to 
drive them in there, as in Diftrefs ; and that if 
they were Englijh really, it was moft probable 
that they were here upon no good Defign; and 
that I had better continue as I was, than fall into 
the Hands of Thieves and Murtherers. 

Let no Man defpife the fecret Hints and Noti- 
ces of Danger, which fometimes are given him, 
when he may think there is no Poffibility of its be- 
ing 



[ *97 ] 



ing real. That fuch Hints and Notices are gi- 
ven us, I believe few that have made any Obferva- 
tions of things, can deny ; that they are certain Dis- 
coveries of an invisible World, and a Converfe of 
Spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the Tendency 
of them feems to be to warn us of Danger, why 
fhould we not fuppofe they are from fome friendly 
Agent, whether fupreme, or inferior, and Subor- 
dinate, is not the Queftion ; and that they are gi- 
ven for our Good ? 

The prefent Queftion abundantly confirms me in 
the Juftice of this Reafoning ; for had I not been 
made cautious by this fecret Admonition, come 
it from whence it will, I had been undone in- 
evitably, and in a far worfe Condition than be- 
fore, as you will fee prefently. 

I had not kept my felf long in this Pofture, but 
I faw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they 
look'd for a Creek to thruft in at for the Conveni- 
ence of Landing ; however, as they did not come 
quite far enough, they did not fee the little Inlet 
where I formerly landed my Rafts ; but run their 
Boat on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a 
Mile from me, which was very happy for me ; for 
otherwife they would have landed juft as I may fay 
at my Door, and would foon have beaten me out of 
my Caftle, and perhaps have plunder'd me of all 
I had. 

When they were on Shore, I was fully fatisfy'd 
that they were Englijh Men ; at leaft, moft of them ; 
one or two I thought were Dutch ; but it did not 
prove fo : There were in all eleven Men, whereof 
three of them I found were unarm'd, and as I 
thought, bound ; and when the firft four or five of 
them were jump'd on Shore, they took thofe three 
out of the Boat as Prifoneers : One of the three I 
could perceive ufing the moft paflionate Geftures of 

Entreaty, 



[a 9 «] 



Entreaty, Afflidion and Defpair, even to a kind 
of Extravagance ; the other two I could perceive 
lifted up their Hands fometimes, and appear'd con- 
cern'd indeed, but not to fuch a Degree as the 
firft. 

I was perfe&ly confounded at the Sight, and 
knew not what the meaning of it fhould be. Fri- 
day caird out to me mEngliJh, as well as he could, 
O Mafter ! Youjee Englifh Mans eat Prifoner as well 
as Savage Mans. Why, fays I, Friday > Do you 
think they are a going to eat them then ! Yes, fays Fri- 
day, They will eat them : No, no, fays I, Friday, / 
am afraid they will murtber them indeed, but you may 
be Jure they will not eat them. 

All this while I had no thought of what the 
Matter really was; but flood trembling with the 
Horror of the Sight, expe&ing every Moment when 
the three Prifoners (hould be kilPd ; nay, once I faw 
one of the Villains lift up his Arm with a great Cut- 
lafh, as the Seamen call it, or Sword, to ftrike one 
of the poor Men ; and I expe&ed to fee him fall e- 
very Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body 
feem'd to run chill in my Veins. 

I wifh'd heartily now for my Spaniard, and the 
Savage that was gone with him ; or that I had a- 
ny way to have come undifcover'd within fhot of 
them, that I might have refcu'd the three Men ; 
for I faw no Fire Arms they had among them ; but 
it fell out to my Mind another way. 

After I had obferv'd the outrageous Ufageof the 
three Men, by the infolent Seamen, I obferv'd the 
Fellows run fcattering about the Land, as if they 
wanted to fee the Country : I obferv'd that the 
three other Men had Liberty to go alfo where they 
pleas'd; but they fat down all three upon the 
Ground, very pen five, and look'd like Men in 
Defpair. 

This 



[*99 ] 

This put me in Mind of the firft Time when I 
came on Shore, and began to look about me ; How 
I gave my felf over for loft : How wildly I look'd 
round me : What dreadful Apprehenfions I had : 
And how I lodg'd in the Tree all Night for fear 
of being devour'd by wild Beafts. 

As I knew nothing that night of the Supply I 
was to receive by the providential Driving of the 
Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by 
which I have fince been fo long nourifh'd and fup- 
ported ; fo thefe three poor defolate Men knew no- 
thing how certain of Deliverance and Supply they 
were, how near it was to them, and how effectu- 
ally and really they were in a Condition of Safety, 
at the fame Time that they thought themfelves 
loft, and their Cafe defperate. 

So little do we fee before us in the World, and 
fo much reafon have we to depend chearfully upon 
the great Maker of the World, that he does not 
leave his Creatures fo abfolutely deftitute, but that 
in the worft Circumftances they have always fome- 
thing to be thankful for, and fdmetimes are nearer 
their Deliverance than they imagine ; nay, are even 
brought to their Deliverance by the Means by 
which they feem to be brought to their Defini- 
tion. 

It was juft at the Top of High- Water when thefe 
People came on Shore, and while partly they flood 
parlying with the prifoners they brought, and part- 
ly while they rambled about to fee what kind of a 
Place they were in ; they had carelefly ftaid till the 
Tide was fpent, and the Water was ebb'd confide- 
rably away, leaving their Boat a-ground. 

They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I 
found afterwards, having drank a little too much 
Brandy, fell a-fleep ; however, one of them waking 
fooner than the other, and finding the Boat too faft 

a-ground 



[3°°] 



a-ground for him to ftir it, hollow'd for the reft who 
were ftraggling about, upon which they all foon 
came to the Boat ; but it was paft all their Strength 
to launch her, the Boat being very heavy, and the 
Shore on that Side being a {oft oufy Sam}, almoft 
like a Quick-Sand. 

In this Condition, like true Seamen who are per- 
haps the leaft of all Mankind given to fore-thought, 
they gave it over, and away they ftrolTd about the 
Country again ; and I heard one of them fay aloud to 
another, calling them off from the Boat, Why let her 
alone > Jack, cant ye, flu will float next Tide; by which 
I was fully confirm'd in the main Enquiry, of what 
Countrymen they were. 

All this while I kept my felf very clofe, not once 
daring to ftir out of my Caftle, any farther than to 
my Place of Obfervation, near the Top of the Hill ; 
and very glad I was, to think how well it was forti- 
fy'd : I knew it was no lefs than tm Hours before 
the Boat could be on float again, and by that Time 
it would be dark, and I might be at more Liberty 
to fee theit Motions, and to hear their Difcourfe, if 
they had any. 

In the mean Time, I fitted my felf up for a Bat- 
tie, as before ; though with more Caution, knowing 
I had to do with another kind of Enemy than I had 
at firft : I order'd Friday alfo, who I had made an 
excellent Marks-Man with his Gun, to load him- 
felf with Arms : I took my felf two Fowling-Pieces, 
and I gave him three Muskets ; my Figure indeed 
was very fierce; I had my formidable Goat-Skin 
Coat on, with the great cap I have mention'd, a 
naked Sword by my Side, two Piftols in my Belt, 
and a Gun upon each Shoulder. 

It was my Defign, as I faid above, not to have 
made any Attempt till it was Dark : But about 
Two a Clock, being the Heat of the Day, I found 

that

that in (hort they were all gone ftraggling into the 
Woods, and as I thought were laid down to Sleep. 
The three poor diftreffed Men, too Anxious for 
their Condition to get any Sleep, were however 
fet down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at a- 
bout a quarter of a Mile from me, and as I 
thought out of fight of any of the reft. 

Upon this I refolv'd to difcover my felf to 
them, and learn fomething of their Condition : 
Immediately I march'd in the Figure as above, my 
Man Friday at a good Diftance behind me, as for- 
midable for his Arms as I, but not making quite fo 
flaring a Speffre-Uke Figure as I did. 

I came as near them undifcover'd as I could, 
and then before any of them faw me, I call'd a- 
loud to them in Spahijb, What are ye Gentlemen ? 

They ftarted up at the Noife, but were ten 
times more confounded when they faw me, and 
the uncouth Figure that I made. They made no 
Anfwer at all, but J thought I perceiv'd them juft 
going to fly from me, when I fpoke to them in 
Englijh, Gentlemen, faid I, do not be furpriz'd at 
me; perhaps you may have a Friend near you 
when you did not expedl it. He muft be fent di- 
reftly from Heaven then, /aid one 0/ them very 
gravely to me, and pulling off bis Hat at tbe/ame time 
to me, for our Condition is paft the Help of Man. 
All Help is from Heaven, Sir, /aid L But can 
you put a Stranger in the way how to help you, 
for you feem to me to be in fome great Diftrefs? 
I faw you when you landed, and when you feem'd 
to make Applications to the Brutes that came with 
you, I faw one of them lift up his Sword to kill 
you. 

The poor Man with Tears running down his 
Face, and trembling, looking like one aftonifh'd, 
return'd, Am I talking to God, or Man ! Is it a real 

Man 



\ 



[3°2<] 



Man, or an Angel I Be in no fear about that, Sir, 
/aid I, if God had fent an Angel to relieve you, he 
would have come better Cloath'd, and Arm'd after 
another manner than you fee me in ; pray lay afide 
your Fears, I am a Man, an Englijh-man^ and dif- 
pos'd to aflift you, you fee ; I have one Servant 
only; we have Arms and Ammunition; ttU us 

freely, Can we ferve you? What is your 

Cafe ? 

Our Cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you, 
while our murtherers are fo near; but in (hort, 
Sir, I was Commander of that Ship, my Men 
have Mutinied againft me; they have been hard- 
ly prevail'd on not to Murther me, and at laft 
have fet me on Shore in this defolate Place, with 
thefe two Men with me ; one my Mate, the o- 
ther a Paflenger, where we expefted to Perifh, be- 
lieving the Place to be uninhabited, and know not 
yet what to think of it. 

Where are thofe Brutes, your Enemies, faid I, 
do you know where they are gone ? There they lye, 
Sir, faid he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees ; my 
Heart trembles, for fear they have feen us, and 
heard you/peak, if they have, they will certainly Mur- 
ther us all. 

Have they any Fire- Arms, faid I, He anfwered 
they had only two Pieces, and one which they 
left in the Boat Well then, faid I, leave the reft 
to me ; I fee they are all afleep, it is an eafie 
thing to kill them all ; but fhall we rather take 
them Prifoners ? He told me there were two def- 
perate Villains among them, that it was fcarce 
fafe to fhew any Mercy to; but if they were fe- 
cur'd, he believ'd all the reft would return to 
their Duty, I ask'd him, which they were ? He 
told me he could not at that diftance defcribe 
them ; but he would obey my Orders in any thing 

I would 



[ 3°3 ] 



I would direct. Well, fays I, let us retreat out of 
their View or Hearing, leaft they awake, and we 
will refolve further ; fo they willingly went back 
with me, till the Woods cover'd us from them. 

Look you, Sir, faid I, if I venture upon your 
Deliverance, are you willing to make two Condi- 
tions with me; he anticipated my Propofals, by 
telling me, that both he and the Ship, if reco- 
ver'd, fhould be wholly Directed and Commanded 
by me in every thing ; and if the Ship was not 
recovered, he would live and dye with me in what 
Part of the World foever I would fend him ; and 
the two other Men faid the fame. 

fVell y fays I, my Conditions are but two. i. That 
while you ftay on this Ifland with me, you will not 
pretend to any Authority here ; and if I put Arms 
into your Hands, you will upon all Occafions give 
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or 
mine, upon this Ifland, and in the mean time be 
govern'd by my Orders. 

2. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd, 
you will carry me and my Man to England Paf- 
fage free. 

He gave me all the aflurances that the Invention 
and Faith of Man could devife, that he would com- 
ply with thefe moft reafonable Demands, and be- 
sides would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge 
it upon all Occafions as long as he liv'd. 

Well then, /aid I, here are three Muskets for 
you, with Powder and Ball; tell me next what 
you think is proper to be done. He fhew'd all the 
Teftimony of his Gratitude that he was able; 
but offer'd to be wholly guided by me. I told him 
I thought it was hard venturing any thing; but 
the beft Method I could think of was to fire upon 
them at once, as they lay ; and if any was not 
kill'd at the firft Volley, and offer'd to fubmit, 

we 



[304] 

we might fave them, and fo put it wholly upon 
God's Providence to diredt the Shot. 

He faid very modeftly, that he was loath to 
kill them, if he could help it, but that thofe two 
were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Au- 
thors o£ all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they 
e&aped, we (hould be undone ftill ; for they would 
go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Com- 
pany, and deftroy us alL /F*// /&*#, fays I, Ne- 
ceffity legitimates my Advice; for it is the only 
Way to fave our Lives. However, feeing him flail 
cautious of fhedding Blood, I told him they (hould 
go themfelves, and manage as they found conve- 
nient. 

In the Middle of this Difcourfe, we heard fbme 
of them awake, and foon after, we few two of 
them on their Feet, I ask'd him, if either of them 
were of the Men who he had faid were the Heads of 
the Mutiny? He faid, No: Well then, faid I, 
you may let them efcape, and Providence feems to 
have wakned them on Purpofe to fave themfelves. 
Now, fays I, if the reft efcape you, it is your 
Fault. 

Animated with this, he took the Musket, I 
had given him, in his Hand, and a Piftoi 
in his Belt, and his two Comerades with 
him, with each Man a Piece in his Hand,, 
The two Men who were with him, going firft,. 
made fome Noife, at which one of the Seamen who 
was awake, turn'd about, and feeing them coming, 
cry'd out to the reft ; but it was too late then ; for 
the Moment he cry'd out, they fir'd ; / mean the two 
Men> the Captain wifely referving his own Piece:. 
They had fo well aim'd their Shot at the Men they 
knew, that one of them was kill'd on the Spot, and 
the other very much wounded ; but not being dead, 
he ftarted up upon his Feet, and call'd eagerly for 

help v 



[ 3°5 ] 



help to the other ; but the Captain ftepping to him, 
told him, 'twas too late to cry for help, he fhould 
call upon God to forgive his Villany, and with that 
Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his Mus- 
ket, fo that he never (poke more : There were three 
more in the Company, and one of them was alfo 
flightly wounded : By this Time I was come, and 
when they faw their Danger, and that it was in vain 
to refift, they begg'd for Mercy : The Captain told 
them, he would fpare their Lives, if they would 
give him any Aflurance of their Abhorrence of the 
Treachery they had been guilty of, and would 
fwear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship, 
and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, 
from whence they came: They gave him all the 
Proteftations of their Sincerity that could be deiird, 
and he was willing to believe them, and fpare their 
Lives, which I was not againft, only that I oblig'd 
him to keep them bound Hand and Foot while they 
were upon the Ifland. 

While this was doing, I fent Friday with the 
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with orders to fecure 
her, and bring away the Oars, and Sail, which 
they did ; and by and by, three ftraggling Men 
that were (happily for them) parted from the reft, 
came back upon hearing the Guns fir'd, and feeing 
their Captain, who before was their Prifoner, now 
their Conqueror, they fubmitted to be bound alfo ; 
and fo our Vi&ory was compleat. 

It now remain'd, that the Captain and I fliould 
enquire into one another's Circumftances : I began 
firft, and told him my whole Hiftory, which he 
heard with an Attention even to Amazement ; and 
particularly, at the wonderful Manner of my being 
furnifh'd with Provifitions and Ammunition ; and 
indeed, as my Story is a whole Colle&ion of Won- 
ders, it affe&ed him deeply ; but when he refle&ed 

X from 



[ 3 o6] 



from thence upon himfelf, and how I feem'd to 
have been preferv'd there, on purpofe to fave his 
Life, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could 
not fpeak a Word more. 

After this Communication was at an End, I car- 
ry'd him and his two Men into my Apartment, 
leading them in, juft where I came out, viz. At the 
Top of the Houfe, where I refrefti'd them with 
fuch Provifions as I had, and fhew'd them all the 
Contrivances I had made, during my long, long, 
inhabiting that Place. 

All I fhew'd them, all I faid to them, was per- 
fectly amazing ; but above all, the Captain admir'd 
my Fortification, and how perfeftly I had conceal'd 
my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having 
been now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees 
growing much fafter than in England, was become 
a little Wood, and fo thick, that it was unpaflable 
in any Part of it, but at that one Side, where I 
had referv'd my little winding Paflage into it : I 
told him, this was my Caftle, and my Refidence ; 
but that I had a Seat in the Country, as moft Prin- 
ces have, whither I could retreat upon Occafion, 
and I would fhew him that too another Time; 
but at prefent, pur Bufinefs was to confider how 
to recover the Ship : He agreed with me as to that ; 
but told me, he was perfectly at a Lofs what Mea- 
fures to take ; for that there were ftill fix and twenty- 
Hands on board, who having entred into a curfed 
Confpiracy, by which they had all forfeited their 
Lives to the Law, would be harden'd in it now by 
Defperation ; and would carry it on, knowing that 
if they were reduc'd, they fhould be brought to the 
Gallows, as foon as they came to England, or to 
any of the Englijh Colonies; and that therefore 
there would be no attacking them, with fo fmall a 
Number as we were. 

I mus'd 



[ 3°7~\ 



I mus'd for fome Time upon what he had faid, 
and found it was a very rational Conclufion ; and 
that therefore fbmething was to be refolv'd on ve- 
ry fpeedily, as well to draw the Men on board in- 
to fome Snare for their Surprize, as to prevent their 
Landing upon us, and destroying us ; upon this it 
prefently occurr'd to me, that in a little while the 
Ship's Crew wondring what was become of their 
Comrades, and of the Boat, would certainly come 
on Shore in their other Boat, to fee for them, and 
that then perhaps they might come arm'd, and be 
too ftrong for us ; this he allow'd was rational. 

Upon this, I told him the firft Thing we had to 
do, was to ftave the Boat, which lay upon the 
Beach, fb that they might not carry her off; and 
taking every Thing out of her, leave her lb far ufelefs 
as not to be fit to fwim ; accordingly we went on 
board, took the Arms which were left on board, 
out of her, and whatever elfe we found there, 
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of 
Rum, a few Bisket Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and 
a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas; the 
Sugar was five cr fix Pounds, all which was ve- 
ry welcome to me, efpecially the Brandy, and 
Sugar, of which I had had none left for many 
Years, 

When we had carry 'd all thefe Things on Shore 
{the Oars, Maft, Sail, and Rudder of the Boat, 
were carry'd away before, as above) we knock'd a 
great Hole in her Bottom, that if they had come 
ftrong enough to mafter us, yet they could not car- 
ry off the Boat. 

Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that 
we could be able to recover the Ship ; but my View 
was that if they went away without the Boat, I did 
not much queftion to make her fit again, to carry us 
away to the Leeward Iflands, and call upon our 

X 2 Friends 



[3°8] 



Friends, the Spaniards, in my Way, for I had then* 
ftill in my Thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our Defigns, and 
had firft, by main Strength heav'd the Boat up up- 
on the Beach, fo high that the Tide would not 
fleet her off at High- Water-Mark ; and bcfides, 
had broke a Hole in her Bottom, too big to be 
quickly ftopp'd, and were fat down mufing what 
we fhould do ; we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and 
faw her make a Waft With her Antient, as a Signal 
for the Boat to come on board ; but no Boat ftirr'd; 
and they fir'd feveral Times, making other Signals 
for the Boat. 

At laft, when all their Signals and Firing prov'd 
fruitlefs, and they found the Boat did not ftir, we 
faw them by the Help of my Glafles, hoift another 
Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and we 
found as they approach'd that there was no lefs 
than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire-Arms 
with them. 

As the Ship lay almoft two Leagues from the 
Shore, we had a full View of them as they came, 
and a plain Sight of the Men even of their Fa- 
ces, becaufe the Tide having fet them a little to 
the Eaft of the other Boat, they row'd up under 
Shore, to come to the fame Place, where the o- 
ther had landed, and where the Boat lay. 

By this Means, I fay, we had a full View of 
them, and the Captain knew the Perfons and Cha- 
racters of all the Men in the Boat, of whom hefaid,. 
that there were three very honeft Fellows, who he 
was fure were led into this Confpiracy by the reft,, 
being over-power'd and frighted. 

But that as for the Boatfwain, who it feems was 
the chief Officer among them, and all the reft, they 
were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew, and 
were no doubt made defperate in their new Enter- 

• . prize* 



[309] 



prize, and terribly apprehenfive he was, that they 
would be too powerful for us. 

I fmil'd at him, and told him, that Men in our 
Circumftances were paft the Operation of Fear: 
That feeing almoft every Condition that could be, 
was better than that which we were fuppos'd to be 
in, we ought to expeft that the Confequence, whe- 
ther Death or Life, would be fure to be a Deli- 
verance: I alk'd him, What he thought of the Cir- 
cumftances of my Life ? And, Whether a Delive- 
rance were not worth venturing for ? And where, 
Sir, faid I, is your Belief of my being preferv d here 
on purpofe to fave your Life, which elevated you a 
little while ago ? For my Part, faid I, there feems 
to be but one Thing amifs in all the Profpeft of it ; 
Wbafs that ? Says he ; why,faid I, 'Tis, that as you 
fay, there are three or four honeft Fellows among 
them, which fhould be fpar'd ; had they been all of 
the wicked Part of the Crew, I fhould fcave thought 
God's Providence had fingled them out to deliver 
them into your Hands ; for depend upon it, every 
Man of them that comes a-fhore are our own, and 
ihall die, or live, as they behave to us. 

As I fpoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful 
Countenance, I found it greatly encourag'd him ; fo 
we fet vigoroufly to our Bufinefs : We had upon the 
firft Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship, 
confider'd of feparating our Prifoners, and had in- 
deed fecur'd them effe&ually. 

Two of them, of whom the Captain was lefs af- 
fur'd than ordinary, I fent with Friday, and one of 
the three (deliver'd Men) to my Cave, where they 
were remote enough, and out of Danger of being 
heard or difcover'd, or of finding their way out of 
the Woods, if they could have deliver'd themfelves: 
Here they left them bound, but gave them Provifi- 
ons, and promis'd them if they continu'd there qui- 

X 3 etly, 



[3io] 

etly, to give them their Liberty in a Day or two ; 
but that if they attempted their Efcape, they fhould 
be put to -Death without Mercy: They promis'd 
faithfully to bear their Confinement with Patience, 
and were very thankful that they had fuch good U- 
fage, as to have Provifions, and a Light left them ; 
for Friday gave them Candles (fuch as we made our 
felves) for their Comfort ; and they did not know- 
but that he flood Sentinel over them at the En- 
trance. 

The other Prifoners had better Ufage ; two of 
them were kept pinion'd indeed, becaufe the Cap- 
tain was not free to truft them ; but the other two 
were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Re- 
commendation, and upon their folemnly engaging 
to live and die with us ; fo with them and the three 
honeft Men, we were feven Men, well arm'd ; and 
I made no doubt we fhou'd be able to deal well e- 
nough with, the Ten that were a coming, confi- 
dering that the Captain had faid, there were three 
or four honeft Men among them alio. 

As foon as they got to the Place where their o- 
ther Boat lay, they run their Boat in to the Beach* 
and came all on Shore, haling the Boat up after 
them, which I was glad to fee ; for I was afraid 
they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor 
fome Diftance from the Shore with fome Hands 
in her, to guard her ; and fo we fhould not be able 
to feize the Boat. 

Being on Shore, the firft Thing they did, they 
ran all to their other Boat, and it was eafy to fee 
that they were under a great Surprize, to find her 
ftripp'd as above, of all that was in her, and a 
great hole in her Bottom. 

After they had mus'd a while upon this, they 
fet up two or three great Shouts, hollowing with 
all their might, to try if they could make their 

Companions 



[3»] 



Companions hear ; but all was to no purpofe : Then 
they came all clofe in a Ring, and fir'd a Volley of 
their fmall Arms, which indeed we heard, and the 
Ecchos made the Woods ring ; but it was all one, 
thofe in the Cave we were fure could not hear, and 
thofe in our keeping, though they heard it well e- 
nough, yet durft give no Anfwer to them. 

They were fo aftonifh'd at the Surprize of this, 
that as they told us afterwards, they refolv'd to go 
all on board again to their Ship, and let them 
know, that the Men were all murther'd, and the 
Long-Boat ftav'd; accordingly they immediately 
launch'd their Boat again, and gat all of them 
on board. 

The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even con- 
founded at this, believing they would go on board 
the Ship again, and fet Sail, giving their Comrades 
for loft, and fo he fhould ftill lofe the Ship, which 
he was in Hopes we ftiould have recover'd ; but 
he was quickly as much frighted the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the Boat, 
but we perceiv'd them all coming on Shore again ; 
but with this new Meafure in their Conduit, which 
it feems they confulted together upon, viz. To 
leave three Men in the Boat, and the reft to go on 
Shore, and go up into the Country to look for their 
Fellows. 

This was a great Diiappointment to us; for 
now we were at a Lofs what to do ; f6r our feizing 
thofe feven Men on Shore would be no Advantage 
to us, if we let the Boat efcape; becaufe they 
would then row away to the Ship, and then the reft 
of them would be fure to weigh and fet Sail, and fo 
our recovering the Ship would be loft. 

However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and 
fee what the Iflue of Things might prefent ; the 
feven Men came on Shore, and the three who re- 

X 4 main'd 



[ 3 12 ] 



main'd in the Boat, put her off to a good Diftance 
from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for 
them ; fo that it was impoflible for us to come at 
them in the Boat. 

Thofe that came on Shore, kept clofe together, 
marching towards the Top of the little Hill, under 
which my Habitation lay ; and we could fee them 
plainly, though they could not perceive us: We 
could have been very glad they would have come 
nearer to us, fo that we might have fir'd at them, 
or that they would have gone farther off, that we 
might have come abroad. 

But when they were come to the Brow of the 
Hill, where they could fee a great way into the 
Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the North- 
Eaft Part, and where the Ifland lay loweft, they 
fhouted, and hollow'd, till they were weary ; and 
not caring it feems to venture far from the Shore, 
nor far from one another, they fat down together 
under a Tree, to confider of it : Had they thought 
fit to have gone to fleep there, as the other Party 
of them had done, they had done the Jobb for us; 
but they were too full of Apprehenfions of Danger, 
to venture to go to fleep, though they could not 
tell what the Danger was they had to fear neither. 

The Captain made a very juft Propofal to me, 
upon this Confutation of theirs, viz. That per- 
haps they would all fire a Volley again, to endea- 
vour to make their Fellows hear and that we 
ihould all Sally upon them, juft at the Jundure 
when their Pieces were all difcharg'd, and they 
would certainly yield, and we fhould have them 
without Blood-fhed : I lik'd the Propofal, provided 
it was done while we were near enough to come 
up to them, before they could load their Pieces 
again. 

But 



[313] 

But this Event did not happen, and we lay ftill 
a long Time, very irrefolute what Courfe to take ; 
at length I told them, there would be nothing to 
be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if 
they did not return to the Boat, perhaps we might 
iind a way to get between them, and the Shore, 
and fo might ufe fome Stratagem with them in the 
Boat, to get them on Shore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient 
for their removing; and were very uneafy, when 
after long Confutations, we faw them Itart all up, 
and march down toward the Sea : It feems they 
had fuch dreadful Apprehenfions upon them, of 
the Danger of the Place, that they refolv'd to go 
on board the Ship again, give their Companions o- 
ver for loft, and fo go on with their intended Voy- 
age with the Ship. 

As foon as I perceiv'd them go towards the Shore, 
I imagin'd it to be as it really was, That they had 
given over their Search, and were for going back 
again ; and the Captain, as foon as I told him my 
Thoughts, was ready to fink at the Apprehenfions 
of it , but I prefently thought of a Stratagem to 
fetch them back again, and which anfwer'd my 
End to a Tittle. 

I order'd Friday > and the Captain's Mate, to go 
over the little Creek Weftward^ towards the Place 
were the Savages came on Shore, when Friday was 
refcu'd ; and as foon as they came to a little rifing 
Ground, at about half a Mile Diftance, I bad them 
hollow, as loud as they could, and wait till they 
found the Seamen heard them ; that as foon as ever 
they heard the Seamen anfwer them, they fhould 
return it again, and then keeping out of Sight, take 
a round, always anfwering when the other hollow'd, 
to draw them as far into the Ifland, and among the 

Woods, 



[314] 



Woods, as poflible, and then wheel about again to 
me, by fuch ways as I dire&ed them. 

They were juft going into the Boat, when Friday 
and the Mate hollow'd, and they prefently heard 
them, and anfwering, run along the Shore Weft- 
ward, towards the Voice they heard, where they 
were prefently ftopp'd by the Creek, where the 
Water being up, they could not get over, and 
call'd for the Boat to come up, and fet them over, 
as indeed I expe&ed. 

When they had fet themfelves over, I obferv'd, 
that the Boat being gone up a good way into the 
Creek, and as it were, in a Harbour within the 
Land, they took one of the three Men out of her to 
go along with them, and left only two in the Boat, 
having faftned her to the Stump of a little Tree on 
the Shore. 

This was what I wifh'd for, and immediately leav- 
ing Friday and the Captain's Mate to their Bufinefs, 
I took the reft with me, and croffing the Creek out 
of their Sight, we furpriz'd the two Men before they 
were aware ; one of them lying on Shore, and the 
other being in the Boat ; the Fellow on Shore, was 
between fleeping and waking, and going to ftart upv 
the Capjain who was foremoft, ran in upon him, 
and khock'd him down, and then call'd out to him 
in the Boat, to yield, or he was a dead Man. 

There needed very few Arguments to perfwade 
a {ingle Man to yield, when he faw five Men upon 
him, and his Comrade knock'd down ; befides, this 
was it feems one of the three who were not fo hearty 
in the Mutiny as the reft of the Crew, and therefore 
was eafily perfwaded, not only to yield, but after- 
wards to joyn very fincere with us. 

In the mean time, Friday and the Captain's Mate 
fo well manag'd their Bufinefs with the reft, that 
they drew them by hollowing and anfwering, from 

one 



[315] 

one Hill to another, and from one Wood to ano- 
ther, till they not only heartily tyr'd them, but left 
them, where they were very fure they could not 
reach back to the Boat, before it was dark ; and 
indeed they were heartily tyr'd themfelves alfo 
by the Time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do, but to watch for 
them, in the Dark, and to fall upon them, fo as to 
make fure work with them. 

It was feveral Hours after Friday came back to 
me, before they came back to their Boat ; and 
we could hear the foremoft of them long before 
they came quite up, calling to thofe behind to 
come along, and could alfo hear them anfwer and 
complain, how lame and tyr'd they were, and not 
able to come any fafter, which was very welcome 
News to us. 

At length they came up to the Boat ; but 'tis 
impoffible to exprefs their Confufion, when they 
found the Boat faft a-Ground in the Creek, the 
Tide ebb'd out, and their two Men gone : We 
could hear them call to one another in a mod la- 
mentable Manner, telling one another, they were 
gotten into an inchanted Ifland ; that either there 
were Inhabitants in it, and they fhould all be mur- 
ther'd, or elfe there were Devils and Spirits in it, 
and they fhould be all carry 'd away, and devour'd. 

They hallow'd again, and call'd their two Come- 
rades by their Names, a great many times, but 
no Anfwer. After fbme time, we could fee 
them, by the little Light there was, run about 
wringing their Hands like Men in Defpair ; and 
that fometimes they would go and fit down in the 
Boat to reft themfelves, then come afhore again, 
and walk about again, and fo over the fame thing 
again. 

My 



[3i6] 



My Men would fain have me given them Leave 
to fall upon them at once in the Dark ; but I was 
willing to take them at fome Advantage, fo to 
fpare them, and kill as few of them as I could ; 
and efpecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing 
any ot our own Men, knowing the other were ve- 
ry well armed. I refolved to wait to fee if they 
-did not feparate ; and therefore to make fure of 
them, I drew my Ambufcade nearer, and order'd 
Friday and the Captain, to creep upon their Hands 
and Feet as clofe to the Ground as they could, 
that they might not be difcover'd, and get as near 
them as they could poffibly, before they offered to 
fire. 

They had not been long in that Poftyre, but that 
the Boatfwain, who was the principal Ringleader 
of the Mutiny, and had now fhewn himfelf the 
moft deje&ed and difpirited of all the reft, came 
walking towards them with two more of their 
Crew ; the Captain was fo eager, as having this 
principal Rogue fo much in his Power, that he 
could hardly have Patience to let him come fo 
near, as to be fure of him ; for they only heard 
Jiis Tongue before : But when they came nearer, 
the Captain and Friday ftarting up on their Feet, 
Jet fly at them. 

The Boatfwain was kill'd ,upon the Spot, the 
next Man was fhot into the Body, and fell juft by 
him, tho' he did not die 'till an Hour or two after ; 
and the third run for it. 

At the Noife of the Fire, I immediately ad- 
vanc'd with my whole Army, which was now 8 
Men, viz. my felf GeneraliJJimo> Friday my Lieu- 
tenant-General, the Captain and his two Men, and 
the three Prisoners of War, who we had trufted 
with Arms. 



We 



13*7] 



We came upon them indeed in the Dark, Co that 
they could not fee our Number ; and I made the 
Man we had left in the Boat, who was now one 
of us, call to them by Name, to try if I could 
bring them to a Parley, and fo might perhaps re- 
duce them to Terms, which fell out juft as we de- 
fir'd: for indeed it was eafy to think, as their 
Condition then was, they would be very willing 
to capitulate ; fo he calls out as loud as he could, 
to one of them, Tom Smithy Tom Smith ; Tom Smith 
anfwered immediately, Who's that, Robinfon ? for 
it feems he knew his Voice : T'other anfwered, Ay, 
ay ; for God's Sake, Tom Smith, throw down your 
Arms, and yield, or, you are all dead Men this Mo- 
ment. 

Who muft we yield to ? where are they ? (fays Smith 
again ;) Here they are, fays he, here's our Captain, 
and fifty Men with him, have been hunting you 
this two Hours ; the Boatfwain is kill'd, Will Frye 
is wounded, and I am a Prifoner ; and if you do not 
yield, you are all loft. 

Will they give us Quarter then, (fays Tom 
Smith) and we will yield ? Til go andajk, if you pro- 
mife to yield, fays Robinfon ; fo he aflt'd the Captain, 
and the Captain then calls himfelf out, You Smith, 
you know my Voice, if you lay down your Arms 
immediately, and fubmit, you fhall have your Lives 
all but Will. Atkins. 

Upon this, Will Atkins cry'd out, For Gois Sake, 
Captain,giveme Quarter, what have I done? They have 
been all as bad as I, which by the Way was not true 
neither ; for it feems this Will. Atkins was the firft 
Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they 
firft mutiny 'd, and ufed him barbaroufly, in tying 
his Hands, and giving him injurious Language. 
However, the Captain told him he muft lay down 
his Arms at Difcretion, and truft to the Gover- 
nor's 



[3i«] 



nour's Mercy, by which he meant me ; for they 
all call'd me Governour. 

In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and 
begg'd their Lives ; and I Tent the Man that had 
parley 'd with them, and two more, who bound 
them all; aod then my great Army of 50 Men, 
which particularly with thofe three, were all but 
eight, came up and feiz'd upon them all, and upon 
their Boat, only that I kept my felf and one more 
out of Sight, for Reafons of State. 

Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and 
think of feizing the Ship ; and as for the Captain, 
now he had Leifure to parley with them : He expo- 
stulated with them upon the Villany of their Pra- 
ctices with him, and at length upon the farther 
Wickednefs of their Defign, and how certainly 
it muft bring them to Miiery and Diftrefs in the 
End, and perhaps to the Gallows. 

They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard 
for their Lives ; as for that, he told them, they 
were none of his Prifoners, but the Commander of 
the Ifland, that they thought they had fet him on 
Shore in a barren uninhabitated Ifland, but it had 
pleafed God fo to direft them, that the Ifland 
was inhabited, and that the Governour was an 
Englijh Man ; that he might hang them all there, if 
he pleafed ; but as he had given them all Quarter, 
he fuppofed he would fend them to England to be 
dealt with there, asjuftice requird, except Jt- 
kins, who he was commanded by the Governour to 
advife to prepare for Death ; for that he would be 
hang'd in the Morning. 

Though this was all a Fi&ion of his own, yet 
it had its de/ired Effedt ; Atkins fell upon his Knees 
to beg the Captain to interceed with the Gover- 
nour for his Life ; and all the reft beg'd of him 

for 



[319] 



for God's Sake, that they might not be fent to 
England. 

It now occurr'd to me, that the time of our De- 
liverance was come, and that it would be a moft 
eafy thing to bring thefe Fellows in, to be hearty 
in getting Pofleflion of the Ship ; fo I retir'd in 
the Dark from them, that they might not fee what 
Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the 
Captain to me; when I call'd, as at a good Di- 
ftance, one of the Men was order'd to fpeak again, 
and fay to the Captain, Captain, the Commander calls 
for you ; and prefently the Captain reply'd, Tell 
his Excellency, I am jujl a coming : This more per- 
fectly amufed them; and they all believed that 
the Commander was juft by with his fifty Men. 

Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him 
my Projedt for feizing the Ship, which he lik'd of 
wonderfully well, and refolv'd to put it in Execu- 
tion the next Morning. 

But in Order to execute it with more Art, and 
fecure of Succefs, I told him, we muft divide the 
Frifoners, and that he fhould go and take Atkins and 
two more of the word of them, and fend them 
pinion'd to the Cave where the others lay : This 
was committed to Friday and the two Men who 
came on Shore with the Captain. 

They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Pri- 
fon ; and it was indeed a difmal Place, efpecially 
to Men in their Condition. 

The other I order'd to my Bower, as I 
call'd it, of which I have given a full Defcrip- 
tion ; and as it was fenc'd in, and they pinion'd, 
the Place was fecure enough, confidering they were 
upon their Behaviour. 

To thefe in the Morning I fent the Captain, who 
was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Word 
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they 

might 



[ 3*°] 



might be trufted or no, to go on Board and furprize 
the Ship. He talk'd to them of the Injury done 
him, of the Condition they were brought to ; and 
that though the Governour had given them 
Quarter for their Lives, as to the prefent Adtion, 
yet that if they were fent to England, they would 
all be hang'd in Chains, to be fure ; but that if 
they would join in fo juft an Attempt, as to reco- 
ver the Ship, he would have the Governour's En- 
gagement for their Pardon. 

Any one may guefs how readily fuch a Propo^ 
fal would be accepted by Men in their Condition ; 
they fell down on their Knees to the Captain, and 
promifed with the deepeft Imprecations, that they 
would be faithful to him to the laft Drop* 
and that they (hould owe their Lives to him, and 
would go with him all over the World, that they 
would own him for a Father to them as long as. 
they liv'd. 

Well, fays the Captain, I muft go and tell the 
Governour what you fay, atid fee what I can do 
to bring him to confent to it : So he brought me 
an Acconnt of the Temper he found them in;, 
and that he verily believ'd they would be faith- 
ful. 

However, that we might be very fecure, I told 
him he fhould go back again, and choofe out five 
of them, and tell them, they might fee that he did 
not want Men, that he would take out five of 
them to be his Afliftants, and that the Governour 
would keep the other two, and the three that were 
fent Prifoners to the Caftle, (my Cave) as Hoftages*. 
for the Fidelity of thofe five; and that if they 
prov'd unfaithful in the Execution, the five Hoftages 
fhould be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore. 

This look'd fevere, and convinc'd them that the 
Governour was in Earned ; however they had no- 
Way 



[3« ] 



Way left them, but to accept it ; and it was now 
the Bufinefs of the Prifoners, as much as of the 
Captain, to perfwade the other five to do their 
Duty 

Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Ex- 
pedition : i. The Captain, his Mate, and Paflen- 
ger. 2. Then the two Prifoners of the firft Gang, 
to whom having their Charafters from the Cap- 
tain, I had given their Liberty, and trufted them 
with Arms. 3. The other two who I had kept 
till now, in my Apartment, pinion'd; but upon 
the Captain's Motion, had now releas'd. 4. The 
fingle Man taken in the Boat. 5. Thefe five re- 
leas'd at laft: So that they were thirteen in all, 
befides five we kept Prifoners in the Cave, and the 
two Hoftages. 

I ask'd the Captain, if he was willing to ven- 
ture with thefe Hands on Board the Ship ; for as 
for me and my Man Friday, I did not think it was 
proper for us to ftir, having feven Men left behind ; 
and it was Employment enough for us to keep 
them aflunder, and fupply them with Viftuals. 

As to the five in the Cave, I refolv'd to keep 
them faft, but Friday went in twice a Day to them, 
to fupply them with Neceflaries ; and I made the 
other two carry Provifions to a certain Diftance, 
where Friday was to take it. 

When I fliew'd my felf to the two Hoftages, it 
was with the Captain, who told them, I was the 
Perfon the Governour had order'd to look after 
them, and that it was the Governour's Pleafure 
they fliould not ftir any where, but by my Dire- 
dion ; that if they did, they fhould be fetch'd in- 
to the Caftle, and be lay'd in Irons ; fo that as we 
never fuffered them to fee me as Governour, fo I 
now appeared as another Perfon, and fpoke of the 

Y Gover- 



Governour, the Garrifon, the Caftle, and the like, 
upon all Occafions. 

The Captain now had no Difficulty before him , 
but to furnifh his two Boats, flop the Breach of 
one, and Man them. He made his Paflenger 
Captain of one, with four - other Men ; and him- 
felf, and his Mate, and fix more, went in the o- 
ther: And they contriv'd their Bufinefs very welJ ; 
for they came up to the Ship about Midnight : As 
foon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made 
Robin/on hale them, and tell them they had brought 
off the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long 
time before they had found them, and the like ; 
holding them in a Chat 'till they came to the Ship's 
Side; when the Captain and the Mate entring 
firft with their Arms, immediately knock'd down 
the fecond Mate and Carpenter, with the But-end 
of their Muskets, being very faithfully feconded 
by their Men, they fecurd all the reft that were 
upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to 
fatten the Hatches to keep them down who were 
below, when the other Boat and their Men entring 
at the fore Chains, fecur'd the Fore-Caftle of the 
Ship, and the Scuttle which went down into the 
Cook Room, making three Men they found there, 
Prifbners. 

When this was done, and all fafeupon Deck, the 
Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break 
into the Round-Houfe where the new Rebel Cap- 
tain lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten 
up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire 
Arms in their Hands, and when the Mate with a 
Crow fplit open the Door, the new Captain and 
his Men fir'd boldly among them, and wounded 
. the Mate with a Musket Ball, which broke his 
Arm, and wounded two more of the Men but 
kill'd no Body. 

The 



[ 3*3 3 



The Mate calling for Help, rufh'd however in- 
to the Round-Houle, wounded as he was, and 
with his Piftol fhot the new Captain thro' the 
Head, the Bullet entring at his Mouth, and came 
out again behind one of his Ears ; (o that he never 
fpoke a Word ; upon which the reft yielded, and 
the Ship was taken effe&ually, without any more 
Lives loft. 

As foon as the Ship was thus fecur'd, the Cap- 
tain order'd feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the 
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice 
of his Succefs, which you may be fure I was very 
glad to hear, having fat watching upon the Shore 
for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning. 

Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me 
down ; and it having been a Day of great Fatigue 
to me, I flept very found, 'till I was fomething uir- 
priz'd with the Noife of a Gun; and prefently 
ftarting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name of 
Governour, Governour, and prefently I knew the 
Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of 
the Hill, there he ftood, and pointing to the Ship, 
he embrac'd me in his Arms, My dear Friend and 
Deliverer \ fays fozjbere'syour Ship, forjhe is all yours \ 
and Jo are we and all that belong to her. I caft my Eyes 
to the Ship, and there fhe rode within little more 
than half a Mile of the Shore ; for they had weigh- 
ed her Anchor as foon as they were Matters of her ; 
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an 
Anchor juftagainft the Mouth of the little Creek; 
and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought 
the Pinnace in near the Place where I at firft 
landed my Rafts, and fo landed juft at my Door. 

I was at firft ready to fink down with the Sur- 
prize. For I faw my Deliverance indeed vifibly 
put into my hands, all things eafy, and a large 
Ship juft ready to carry me away whither I plea- 

Y 2 fed 



[3*4] 



fed to go. At firft, for fome time, I was not able 
to anfwer him one Word ; but as he had taken me 
in his Arms, I held faft by him, or I ftiould have 
fallen to the Ground. 

He perceived the Surprize, and immediately 
pulls a Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a 
Dram of Cordial , which he had brought on Pur- 
pofe for me ; after I had drank it, I fat down up- 
on the Ground; and though it brought me to my 
felf, yet it was a good while before I could fpeak 
a Word to him. 

All this while the poor Man was in as great an 
Ext^fy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was ; 
and he faid a thoufand kind tender things to me, to 
compofe me and bring me to my felf; but fuch was 
the Flood of Joy in my Breaft, that it put all my 
Spirits into Confufion, at laft it broke put into 
Tears, and in a little while after, I recovered my 
Speech. 

Then I took my Turn, and embrac'd him as 
my Deliverer; and we rejoyc'd together. I told 
him, I look upon him as a Man fent from Heaven 
to deliver me, and that the whole Tranfa&ion 
feemed to be a Chain of Wonders; that fuch things 
as thele were the Teftimonies we had of a fecret 
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an 
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could 
fearch into the remoteft Corner of the World, and 
fend Help to the Miferable whenever he pleafed. 

I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankful- 
nefs to Heaven, and what Heart could forbear to 
blefs him, who had not only in a miraculous Man- 
ner provided for once in fuch a Wildernefs, and 
in fuch a deiblate Condition, but from whom every 
Deliverance muft always be acknowledged to pro- 
ceed. 

When 



[3*5] 



When we had talk'd a while, the Captain told 
me, he had brought me fome little Rerrefhment, 
fuch as the Ship afforded, and fuch as the Wretches 
that had been fo long his Mailer had not plunder 'd 
him of: Upon this he calTd aloud to the Boat, and 
bid his Men bring the things afhore that were for 
the Governour ; and indeed it was a Prefent, as if 
I had been one not that was to be carry'd away 
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell 
upon the Ifland ftill, and they were to go without 
me. 

Firft he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full 
of excellent Cordial Waters, fix large Bottles of 
Madera Wine ; the Bottles held two Quarts a-piece ; 
two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve 
good Pieces of the Ship's Beef, and fix Pieces of 
Pork, with a Bag of Peafe, and about a hundred 
Weight of Bisket. 

He brought me alfo a Box of Sugar, a Box of 
Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles 
•of Lime-juice, and Abundance of other things : 
But befides thefe, and what was a thoufand times 
more ufeful to me, he brought me fix clean new 
Shirts, fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of 
Gloves, one Pair of Shoes, a Hat, and one Pair 
of Stockings, and a very good Suit of Cloaths of 
his own, which had been worn but very little : In 
a Word, he cloathed me from Head to Foot. 

It was a very kind and agreeable Prefent, as any 
one may imagine to one in my Circumftances : But 
never was anything in the World of that Kind fo 
unpleafant, awkard, and uneafy, as it was to me to 
wear fuch Cloaths at their firft putting on. 

After thefe Ceremonies paft, and after all his 
good things were brought into my little Apart- 
ment, we began to comult what was to be done : 
with the Prifoners we had ; for it was worth con- 

Y 3 fidering, 



[3*6] 



fidering, whether we might venture to take them a- 
way with us or no, efpecially two of them, who 
we knew to be incorrigible and refra&ory to the 
laft Degree ; and the Captain faid, he knew they 
were fuch Rogues, that there was no obliging 
them, and if he did carry them away, it muft be 
in Irons, as Malefa&ors to be delivered over to Ju- 
ftice at the firft Englijh Colony he could come at ;. 
and I found that the Captain himfelf was very an- 
xious about it. 

Upon this, I told him, that if he defir'd it, I 
durft undertake to bring the two Men he {poke of,, 
to make it their own Requeft that he fhould leave 
them upon the Ifland : I Jhould be very glad of tbat>. 
fays the Captain, with all my Heart. 

Well, fays I, I will fend for them up, and talk 
with them for you ; fo I caufed Friday and the two 
Hoftages, for they were now difcharg'd, their Com- 
rades having perform'd their Promife ; I fay, I cau- 
fed them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five 
Men pinion'd, as they were, to the Bower, and. 
keep them there'till I came. 

After fome time, I came thither drefs'd in my 
new Habit, and now I was call'd Governour again; 
being all met, and the Captain with me, I caufed 
the Men to be brought before me, and I told them,, 
I had had a full Account of their villanous Behavi- 
our to the Captain, and how they had run away 
with the Ship, and were preparing to commit 
farther Robberies, but that Providence had en- 
fnar'd them in their own Ways, and that they 
were fallen into the Pit which they had digged for 
others. 

I let them know, that by my Diredion the Ship 
had been feiz'd, that fhe lay now in the Road ; and 
they might fee by and by, that their new Captain 

had 



[ 3*7 ] 



tad receiv'd the Reward of his Villany; for that 
they might fee him hanging at the Yard-Arm. 

That as to them, I wanted to know what they 
had to fay, why I fhould not execute them as Pi- 
rates taken in the Fad, as by my Commiflion they 
could not doubt I had Authority to do. 

One of them anfwer'd in the Name of the reft, 
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when 
they were taken, the Captain promis'd them their 
Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy ; But 
I told them, I knew not what Mercy to (hew them ; 
for as for my felf, I had refolv'd to quit the 
Ifland with all my Men, and had taken Paflage 
with the Captain to go for England : And as for 
the Captain, he could not carry them to England^ 
other than as Prifbners in Irons to be try'd for 
Mutiny, and running away with the Ship; the 
Confequence of which, they muft needs know, 
would be the Gallows; fo that I could not tell 
which was beft for them, unlefs they had a Mind 
to take their Fate in the Ifland ; if they defir'd, that 
I did not care, as I had Liberty to leave it, I had 
fome Inclination to give them their Lives, if they 
thought they could fhift on Shore. 

They feem'd very thankful for it, faid they would 
much rather venture to ftay there, than to be car- 
ry 'd to England to be hang'd ; fb I left it on that 
Iflue. 

However, the Captain feem'd to make 
fome Difficulty of it, as if he durft not leave them 
there : Upon this I feem'd a little angry with the 
Captain, and told him, ' That they were my Prifo- 
ners, not his ; and that feeing I had offered them 
fo much Favour, I would be as good as my Word ; 
and that if he did not think fit to content to it, I 
would fet them at Liberty, as I found them; and 

Y 4 if 



[3*8] 



if he did not like it, he might take them again if 
he could catch them. 

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac- 
cordingly fet them at Liberty, and bad them re* 
tire into the Woods to the Place whence they 
came, and I would leave them fome Fire Arms, 
fome Ammunition, and fome Directions how they 
fhould live very well, if they thought fit. 

Upon this I prepar d to go on Board the Ship, 
but told the Captain, that I would ftay that Night 
to prepare my things, and defir'd him to go on 
Board in the mean time, and keep all right in the 
Ship, and fend the Boat on Shore the next Day 
for me ; ordering him in the mean time to caufe 
the new Captain who was kill'd, to be hang'd at 
the Yard-Arm that thefe Men might fee him. 

When the Captain was gone, I fent for the Men 
up to me to my Apartment, and entred ferioufly 
into Difcourfe with them of their Circumftances, 
I told them, I thought they had made a right 
Choice ; that if the Captain carry'd them away, 
they would certainly be hang'd. I (hewed them 
the new Captain, hanging at the Yard-Arm of the 
Ship, and told them they had nothinglefs to expert 

When they had all declar'd their Willingnefs to 
ftay, I then told them, I would let them into the 
Story of my living there, and put them into the 
Way of making it eafy to them : Accordingly I 
gave them the whole Hiftory of the Place, and of 
my coming to it ; fhew'd them my Fortifications, 
the Way I made my Bread, planted my Corn, cu- 
red my Grapes; and in a Word, all that was ne- 
ceflary to make them eafy : I told them the Story 
alio of the fixteen Spaniards that were to be expe- 
cted ; for whom I left a Letter, and made them 
promife to treat them in common with themfelves. 

I left 



[ 3*9 ] 

I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Muskets, 
three Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had 
above a Barrel and half of Powder left ; for after 
the firft Year or two, I ufed but little, and wafted 
none. I gave them a Defcription of the Way I 
managd the Goats, and Directions to milk and 
fatten them, and to make both Butter and Cheefe. 

In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own 
Story ; and I told them, I would prevail with the 
Captain to leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder 
more, and fome Garden-Seeds, which I told them 
I would have been very glade of; alfo I gave them 
the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had brought 
me to eat, and bad them be fure to fow and en- 
creafe them. 

Having .done all this, I left them the next Day, 
and went on Board the Ship : We prepared imme- 
diately to fail, but did not weigh that Night : 
The next Morning early, two of the five Men 
came fwimming to the Ship's Side, and making a 
moft lamentable Complaint of the other three, beg- 
ged to be taken into the Ship, for God's Sake, for 
they fhould be murthered, and begg'd the Captain 
to take them on Board, tho* he hang'd them imme- 
diately. 

Upon this the Captain pretended to have no 
Power without me ; But after fome Difficulty, 
and after their folemn Promifes of Amendment, 
they were taken, and were fome time after foundly 
whipp'd and pickl'd ; after which,they prov'd very 
honeft and quiet Fellows. 

Some time after this, the Boat was order'd on 
Shore, the Tide being up, with the things promi- 
fed to the Men, to which the Captain at my In- 
terceffion caufed their Chefts and Cloaths to be ad- 
ed, which they took, and were very thankful for ; 
I alfo encouraged them, by telling them, that if 

it 



[33°] 



it lay in my Way to fend any Veflel to take them 
in, I would not forget them. 

When I took leave of this Ifland, I carry'd on 
board for Reliques, the great Goat's-Skin-Cap I 
had made, my Umbrella, and my Parrot; alfo I 
forgot not to take the Money I formerly mentioned, 
which had lain by me fo long ufelefe, that it was 
grown rufty, or tarnifh'd, and could hardly pais 
for Silver, till it had been a little rubb'd, and 
handled ; as alfo the Money I found in the Wreck 
of the Spanijb Ship. 

And thus I left the Ifland, the Nineteenth of 
December % as I found by the Ship's Account, in the 
Year i<58<5, after I had been upon it eight and 
twenty Years, two Months, and ig Days; being 
deliver'd from this fecond Captivity, the fame Day 
of the Month, that I firft made my Efcape in the 
Barco-Longo, from among the Moors of Sallee. 

In this Veflel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in 
England^ the Eleventh of June, in the Year i (587, 
having been thirty and five Years abfent. 

When I came to England, I was as perfedt a 
Stranger to all the World, as if I had never been 
known there. My Benefador and faithful Stew- 
ard, who I had left in Truft with my Money, was 
alive ; but had had great Misfortunes in the World ; 
was become a Widow the fecond Time, and very low 
in the World : I made her eafy as to what (he ow'd 
me, afluring her, I would give her no Trouble ; but 
onthe contrary, in Gratitude to her former Care 
and Faithfulnefs to me, I reliev'd her as my little 
Stock would afford, which at that Time would 
indeed allow me to do but little for her ; but I aflur'd 
her, I would never forget her former Kindnefs to me ; 
nor did I forget her, when I had fufficient to help 
her, as (hall be obferv'd in its Place. 

I went 



I 33* ] 



I went down afterwards into Torkjbire ; but my 
Father was dead, and my Mother, and all the Fa- 
mily extindt, except that I found two Sifters, and 
two of the Children of one of my Brothers ; and 
as I had been long ago given over for dead, there 
had been no Provifion made for me ; fo that in a 
Word, I found nothing to relieve, or affift me ; and 
that little Money I had, would not do much for 
me, as to fettling in the World. 

I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which 
I did not expeft ; and this was, That the Matter 
of the Ship, who I had fo happily deliver'd, and 
by the fame Means fav'd the Ship and Cargo, ha- 
ving giving a very handfome Account to the 
Owners, of the Manner how I had fav'd the Lives 
of the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet 
them, and fome other Merchants concern'd, and al- 
together made me a very handfome Compliment 
upon the Subjecft, and a Prefent of almoft two 
hundred Pounds Sterling. 

But after making feveral Reflections upon the 
Circumftances of my Life, and how little way this 
would go towards fettling me in the World, I re- 
folv'd to go to Lisbon, and fee if I might not come 
by fome Information of the State of my Plantation 
in the Brafils, and of what was become of my 
Partner, who I had reafon to fuppofe had fome 
4 Years now given me over for dead. 

With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon, 
where I arriv'd in April following ; my Man Fri- 
day accompanying me very honeftly in all thefe 
Ramblings, and proving a moft faithful Servant up- 
on all Occafions. 

When I came to Lisbon, I found out by Enquiry, 
and to my particular Satisfa&ion, my old Friend 
the Captain of the Ship, who firft took me up at 
Sea, off of the Shore of A/rick : He was now 

grown 



E33 2 -] 



grown old, and had left off the Sea, having put 
his Son, who was far from a young Man, into his 
Ship ; and who ftill ufed the Brafil Trade. The 
old Man did not know me, and indeed, I hardly 
knew him ; but I foon brought him to my Remem- 
brance, and as foon brought my felf to his Remem- 
brance, when I told him who I was. 

After fome paffionate Expreflions of the old Ac- 
quaintance, I enquir'd, you may be fure, after my 
Plantation and my Partner : The old Man told me 
he had not been in the Brafils for about nine Years ; 
but that he could afliire me, that when he came 
away, my Partner was living, but the Truftees, 
who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of 
my Part, were both dead ; that however, he be- 
liev'd that I would have a very good Account of 
the Improvement of the Plantation ; for that upon 
the general Belief of my being caft away, and 
drown'd, my Truftees had given in the Account of 
the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the 
Procurator Fifcal, who had appropriated it, in 
Cafe I never came to claim it ; one Third to the 
King, and two Thirds to the Monaftery of St. Au- 
guftine y to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor, 
and for the Conversion of the Indians to the Catho- 
lick Faith ; but that if I appear'd, or any one for 
me, to claim the Inheritance, it Should be reftor'd ; 
only that the Improvement, or Annual Produftion, 
being diftributed to charitable Ufes, could not be 
reftor'd ; but he affur'd me, that the Steward of 
the King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Provie- 
dore, or Steward of the Monaftery, had taken great 
Care all along, that the Incumbent, that is to fay 
my Partner, gave every Year a faithful Account o 
the Produce, of which they receiv'd duly myf 
Moiety. 

I ask'd 



[ 333 3 



I ask'd him if he knew to what height of Im- 
provement he had brought the Plantation? And, 
Whether he thought it might be worth looking af- 
ter ? Or, Whether on my going thither, I fhould 
meet with no Obftru&ion to my Poflefling my juft 
Right in the Moiety ? 

He told me, he could not tell exa&ly, to what 
Degree the Plantation was improv'd ; but this he 
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding Rich 
upon the enjoying but one half of it ; and that to 
the beft of his Remembrance, he had heard, that 
the King's Third of my Part, which was it feems 
granted away to fome other Monaftery, or Religi- 
ous Houfe, amounted to above two hundred Moi- 
dores a Year ; that as to my being reftor'd to a 
quiet Pofleflion of it, there was no queftion to be 
made of that, my Partner being alive to witnefs 
my Title, and my Name being alfo enrolled in the 
Regifter of the Country ; alfo he told me, That 
the Survivors of my two Truftees, were very fair 
honeft People, and very Wealthy ; and he believ'd 
I would not only have their Affiftance for putting 
me in Pofleflion. but would find a verv confiderable 
Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Account ; 
being the Produce of the Farm while their Fathers 
held the Truft, and before it was given up as a- 
bove, which as he remember'd, was for about 
twelve Years. 

I fhew'd my felf a little concern'd, and uneafy 
at this Account, and enquir'd of the old Captain, 
How it came to pafs, that the Truftees fhould thus 
difpofe my EfFedts, when he knew that I had made 
my Will, and had made him, the Portuguefe Cap- 
tain, my univerfal Heir, &V. 

He told me, that was true ; but that as there 
was no Proof of my being dead, he could not ad 
as Executor, until fome certain Account fhould 

come 



[ 334] 



come of my Death, and that befides, he was 
not willing to intermeddle with a thing fo remote ; 
that it was true he had regiftred my Will, 
and put in his Claim ; and could he have given 
any Account of my being dead or alive, he would 
have afted by Procuration, and taken Pofleflion of 
the Ingenio^ fo they call'd the Sugar-Houfe,and had 
given his Son, who was now at the Bra/ils, Or- 
der to do it. 

But, fays the old Man, I have one Piece of 
News to tell you, which perhaps may not be fo 
acceptable to you as the reft, and that is, That 
believing you were loft, and all the World believ- 
ing fo alfo, your Partner and Truftees did of- 
fer to accompt to me in your Name, for fix or 
eight of the firft Years of Profits, which I receiv'd ; 
but there being at the time, fays he, great Dif- 
burfments for encreafing the Works, building an 
Ingenio, and buying Slaves, it did not amount to 
near fb much as afterwards it produced : However, 
fays the old Man, I fliall give you a true Account 
of what I have received in all, and how I have 
difpofed of it. 

After a few Days farther Conference with this 
ancient Friend, he brought me an Account of the fix 
firft Years Income of my Plantation, fign'd by my 
Partner and the Merchants Truftees, being al- 
ways deliver'd in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll, 
and Sugar in Chefts, befides Rum, Moloftus, &?r. 
which is the Confequence of a Sugar Work ; and 
I found by this Account, that every Year the In- 
come confiderably encreafed; but as above, the 
Disburfement being large, the Sum at firft was 
finall : However, the old Man let me fee, that he 
was Debtor to me 470 Motdores of Gold, befides 
60 Chefts of Sugar, and 15 double Rolls of To- 
bacco which were loft in his Ship ; he having been 

Ship- 



[335 ] 



Ship-wreck'd coming Home to Lisbon about 1 1 
Years after my leaving the Place. 

The good Man then began to complain of his 
Misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to 
make Ufe of my Money to recover his Lofles, and 
buy him a Share in a new Ship : However, my 
old Friend, fays he, you fliall not want a Supply 
in your Neceffity ; and as foon as my Son returns, 
you (hall be fully (atisfy'd. 

Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and 
gives me 1 60 Portugal Moidores in Gold ; and 
giving me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, 
which his Son was gone to the Brafils in, of which 
he was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son ano- 
ther, he puts them both into my Hands for Secu- 
rity of the reft. 

I was too much mov'd with the Honefty and 
Kindnefs of the poor Man, to be able to bear 
this; and remembring what he had done for me, 
how he had taken me up at Sea, and how 
generoufly he had ufed me on all Occasions, and 
particularly, how fincere a Friend he was now to 
me, I could hardly refrain Weeping at what he 
faid to me : Therefore, firft I asked him, if his 
Circumftances admitted him to (pare fo much 
Money at that time, and if it would not ftrait- 
en him ? He told me, he could not fay but it 
might ftraiten him a little ; but however it was 
my Money, and I might want it more than he. 

Every thing the good Man faid was full of Af- 
fection, and I could hardly refrain from Tears 
while he fpoke : In fhort, I took 100 of the Moi- 
dores, and caird for a Pen and Ink to give him a 
Receipt for them ; then I returned him the reft, and 
told him,If ever I had Poffeffion of the Plantation, I 
would return the other to him alfo,as indeed I af- 
terwards did ; and that as to the Bill of Sale of 

his 



[33«] 

his Part in his Son's Ship, I would not take it by 
any Means ; but that if I wanted the Money, I 
found he was honeft enough to pay me ; and if I 
did not, but came to receive what he gave me rea- 
fon to expeft, I would never have a Penny more 
from him. 

When this was pafs'd, the old Man began to ask 
me, If he ihould put me into a Method to make my 
Claim to my Plantation ? I told him, I thought to 
go over to it my felf : He faid, I might do fo if I 
pleas'd ; but that if I did not, there were Ways e- 
nough to fecure my Right, and immediately to ap- 
propriate the Profits to my Ufe ; and as there were 
Ships in the River of Lisbon, juft ready to go away 
to Brqftl, he made me enter my Name in a Publick 
Regifter, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath 
that I was alive, and that I was the fame Perfon 
who took up the Land for the Planting the faid 
Plantation at firft. 

This being regularly attefted by a Notary, and 
a Procuration affix'd, he directed me to fend it 
with a. Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of 
his Acquaintance at the Place, and then proposed 
my ftaymg with him till an Account came of 
the Return. 

Never any Thing was more honourable, than 
the Proceedings upon this Procuration ; for in lefs- 
than feven Months, I receiv'd a large Packet from 
the Survivors of my Truftees the Merchants, for 
whofe Account I went to Sea, in which were the 
following particular Letters and Papers enclos'd. 

Firft, There was the Account Current of the 
Produce of my Farm, or Plantation, from the Year 
when their Fathers had ballanc'd with my old Por- 
tugal Captain, being for fix Years ; the Ballance- 
appear'd to be 1 1 74 Moidores in my Favour. 

Secondly^ 



[ 337] 

Secondly y There was the Account of four Years 
more while they kept the Effe&s in their Hands, 
before the Government claim'd the Adminiftration, 
as being the Effe&s of a Perfon not to be found, 
which they calPd Civil Death \ and the Ballance of 
this, the Value of the Plantation encreafing, a- 
mounted to Cruifadoes, which made 

3241 Moidores. 

Thirdly ', There was the Prior of the Auguftitis 
Account, who had receiv'd the Profits for above 
fourteen Years ; but not being to account for what 
was difpos'd to the Hofpital, very honeftly de- 
clar'd he had 872 Moidores not diftributed, which 
he acknowledged to my Account, as to the King's 
Part, that refunded nothing. 

There was a Letter of my Partner's, congratula- 
ting me very affe&ionately upon my being alive, 
giving me an Account how the Eftate was im- 
prov'd, and what it produced a Year, with a Par- 
ticular of the Number of Squares or Acres that it 
contained ; how planted, how many Slaves there 
were upon it, and making two and twenty Crofles 
for Bleffings, told me he had faid fo many Ave 
Marias to thank the Bleffed Virgin that I was 
alive ; inviting me very paflionately to come over 
and take Pofleffion of my own ; and in the mean 
time to give him Orders to whom he fliould deli- 
ver my Effe&s, if I did not come my felf ; con- 
cluding with a hearty Tender of his Friendfhip, 
and that of his Family, and fent me, as a Prefent, 
feven fine Leopard's Skins, which he had it feems 
received from Africa, by fome other Ship which he 
had fent thi ther, and who it feems had made a bet- 
ter Voyage than I : He fent me alfo five Chefts of 
excellent Sweet-meats, and an hundred Pieces of 
Gold uncoin'd, not quite fo large as Moidores. 

Z By 



[338] 



By the fame Fleet, my two Merchant Truftees 
fhipp'd me 1200 Chefts of Sugar, 800 Rolls of To- 
bacco, and the reft of the whole Accompt in Gold. 
I might well fay, now indeed, That the latter 
End of yob was better than the Beginning. It 
is impoffible to exprefs here the Flutterings of my 
very Heart, when I look'd over thefe Letters, and 
efpecially when I found all my Wealth about me ; 
for as the Brajil Ships come all in Fleets, the 
fame Ships which brought my Letters, brought 
my Goods ; and the Effedts were fafe in the Ri- 
ver before the Letters came to my Hand. In a 
Word, I turned pale, and grew fick; and had 
not the old Man run and fetch'd me a Cordial, I 
believe the fudden Surprize of Joy had overfet 
Nature, and I had dy'd upon the Spot. 

Nay after that, I continu'd very ill, and was fo 
fome Hours, 'till a Phyfician being fent for, and 
fomething of the real Caufe of my Illnefs being 
known, he order'd me to be let Blood; after 
which, I had Relief, and grew well : But I verily 
believe, if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given 
in that Manner, to the Spirits, I fhould have 
dy'd. 

I was now Mafter, all on a Sudden, of above 
5000 /. Sterling in Money, and had an Eftate, as 
I might well call it, in the Brafils> of above a 
thoufand Pounds a Year, as fure as an Eftate of 
Lands in England*. And in a Word, I was in a 
Condition which I fcarce knew how to underftand, 
or how to compofe my felf, for the Enjoyment 
ofit. 

The firft thing I did, was to recompenfe my o- 
riginal Benefa&or, my good old Captain, who 
had been firft charitable to me in my Diftrefs, 
kind to me in my Beginning, and honeft to me at 
the End : I fhew'd him all that was fent me, I 

told 



. 



[ 339 ] 



told him, that next to the Providence of Heaven, 
which difpofes all things, it was owing to him ; 
and that it now lay on me to reward him, which 
I would do a hundred fold : So I firft return'd to 
him the hundred Moidores I had receiv'd of him, 
then I fent for a Notary, and caufed him to draw 
up a general Releafe or Difcharge for the 470 
Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd he ow'd 
me in the fulleft and firmeft Manner poffible ; af- 
ter which, I caufed a Procuration to be drawn, 
impoWering him to be my Receiver of the annual 
Profits of my Plantation, and appointing my Part- 
ner to accompt to him, and make the Returns by 
the ufual Fleets to him in my Name ; and a Claufe 
in the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a 
Year to him, during his Life, out of the Effe&s, 
and 50 Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for 
his Life : And thus I requited my old Man, 

I was now to confider which Way to fleer my 
Courfe next, and what to do with the Eftate that 
Providence had thus put into my Hands ; and in- 
deed I had more Care upon my Head now, than 
I had in my filent State of Life in the Ifland, 
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and 
had nothing but what I wanted : Whereas I had 
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs 
was how to fecure it. I had ne'er a Cave now to 
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye 
without Lock or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and 
tarnifh'd before any Body would meddle with it : 
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or 
who to truft with it. My old Patron, the Cap- 
tain, indeed was honeft, and that was the only Re- 
fuge I had. 

In the next Place, my Intereft in the Braftls 
feem'd to fummon me thither, but now I could 
not tell, how to think of going thither, 'till I had 

Z 2 fettled 



[ 34° ] 



fettled my Affairs, and left my Effe<fts in fome fafe 
Hands behind me. At firft I thought of my old 
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honeft, and 
would be juft to me ; but then fhe was in Years,, 
and but poor, and for ought I knew, might be in 
Debt ; fo that in a Word, I had no Way but to 
go back to England my felf, and take my Effe<5ls. 
with me. 

It was fome Months however before I refolved 
upon this ; and therefore, as I had rewarded the 
old Captain fully, and to his Satisfaction, who had 
been my former Benefadtor, fo I began to think of 
my poor Widow, whofe Husband had been my 
firft Benefactor, and (he, while it was in her Power* 
my faithful Steward and Inftrudor. So the firft 
thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lisbon to write 
to his Correfpondent in London, not only to pay a; 
Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Mo- 
ney, an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk 
with her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by tel- 
ling her fhe fhould, if I liv'd, have a further Sup- 
ply : At the fame time I fent my two Sifters in 
the Country, each of them an Hundred Pounds, 
they being, though not in Want, yet not in very 
good Circumftances ; one having been marry , d > 
and left a Widow ; and the other having a Hus- 
band not fo kind to her as he fhould be. 

But among all my Relations, or Acquaintances, I 
could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durft com- 
mit the Grofs of my Stock, that I might go away 
to the Brqfils, and leave things fafe behind me ; and 
this greatly perplex'd me. 

I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brafils Y 
and have fettled my felf there ; for I was, as it 
were, naturaliz'd to the Place ; but I had fome lit- 
tle Scruple|in my Mind about Religion, which in- 
fenfibly drew me back , of which I fhall fay 

more 



[ 34 1 ] 



•more prefently. However, it was not Religion 
that kept me from going there for the prefent ; 
and as I had made no Scruple of being openly of 
the Religion of the Country, all the while I was 
among them, fo neither did I yet; only that now 
and then having of late thought more of it, (than 
formerly) when I began to think of living and dying 
among them, I began to regret my having profefs d 
my felf a Papift, and thought it might not be the 
beft Religion to die with. 

But,as I have faid,this was not the main thing that 
kept me from going to the Brajils> but that real- 
ly I did not know with whom to leave my Effects 
behind me ; fo I refolv'd at laft to go to England 
with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I fhould 
make fome Acquaintance, or find fome Relations 
that would be faithful to me ; and according I pre- 
paid to go for England with all my Wealth. 

In order to prepare things for my going Home, I 
iirft, the Brafil Fleet being juft going away, refolved 
to give Anfwers fuitable to the juft and faithful Ac- 
count of things I had from thence ; and firft to the 
Prior of St. Auguftine I wrote a Letter full of Thanks 
for their juft Dealings, and the Offer of the 872 
Moidores, which was indifpofed of, which I de- 
fir'd might be given 500 to the Monaftery, and 
372 to the Poor, as the Prior fhould dired, defi- 
ring the good Padres Prayers for me, and the like. 

I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to my two 
Truftees, with all the Acknowledgment that fo 
much Juftice and Honefty call'd for; as for fen- 
ding them any Prefent, they were far above having 
any Occafion of it. 

Lajlly, I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging 
his Induftry in the Improving the Plantation, and 
his Integrity in encreafing the Stock of the Works, 
giving him Inftrudtions for his future Govern- 

Z 3 ment 



[ 34*] 



ment of my Part, acccording to the Powers I had 
left with my old Patron, to whom I defir'd him to 
fend whatever became due to me, 'till he fhould 
hear from me more particularly ; affuring him that 
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, 
but to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of my 
Life: To this I added a very handfom Prefent of fome 
Italian Silks for his Wife, and two Daughters, for 
fuch the Captain's Son inform'd me he had ; with 
two Pieces of fine Englijh broad Cloath, the beft 
I could get in Lisbon^ five Pieces of black Bays, 
and fome Flanders Lace of a good Value. 

Having thus fettled my Affairs, fold my Car- 
goe, and turnd all my EfFedts into good Bills of 
Exchange, my next Difficulty was, which Way to 
go to England : I had been accuftomed enough to 
the Sea, and yet I had a ftrange Averfion to going 
to England 'by Sea at that time ; and though I could 
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encreas'd 
upon me fo much, that though I had once fhipp'd 
my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind, 
and that not once, but two or three times. 

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea, and 
this might be fome of the Reafon : But let no 
Man flight the ftrong Impulfes of his own Thoughts 
in Cafes of fuch Moment : Two of the Ships 
which I had fingl'd out to go in, I mean, more 
particularly fingl'd out than any other, that is to 
fay, fo as in one of them to put my things on 
Board, and in the other to have agreed with the 
Captain ; I fay, two of thefe Ships mifcarry'd, viz. 
One was taken by the Algerine y and the other was* 
caft away on the Start near Torbay, and all the 
People drown'd except three ; fo that in either of 
thofe Veflels I had been made miferable ; and in 
which moft, it was hard to fay. 

Ha- 



[343 ] 



Having been thus harafs'd in my Thoughts, my 
old Pilate, to whom I communicated every thing, 
prefs'd me earneftly not to go by Sea, but either 
to go by Land to the Groyne, and crofs over the 
Bay of Bifcay to Rocbell, from whence it was but 
an eafy and fafe Journey by Land to Paris, and fo 
to Calais and Dover ; or to go up to Madrid, and 
fo all the Way by Land thro* France. 

In a Word, I was fo prepoflefs'd againft my going 
by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that 
I refolv'd to travel all the Way by Land; which 
as I was not in Hafte, and did not value the 
Charge, was by much the pleafanter Way; and to 
make it more fo, my old Captain brought an En- 
glijb Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Lisbon , 
who was willing to travel with me : After which, 
we pick'd up two more Englijh Merchants alfo, and 
two young Portuguefe Gendemen, the laft going to 
Paris only ; fo that we were in all fix of us, and 
five Servants ; the two Merchants and the two 
Portugnefe, contenting themfelves with one Ser- 
vant, between two, to fave the Charge ; and as for 
me, I got an Englijh Sailor to travel with me as 
a Servant, befides my Man Friday, who was too 
much a Stranger to be capable of fupplying the 
Place of a Servant on the Road. 

In this Manner I fet out from Lisbon ; and our 
Company being all very well mounted and armed, 
we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the 
Honour to call me Captain, as well becaufe 
I was the oldeft Man, as becaufe I had two Ser- 
vants, and indeed was the Original of the whole 
Journey. 

As I have troubled you with none of my Sea- 
Journals, fo I (hall trouble you now with none of 
my Land- Journal : But fome Adventures that hap- 

Z 4 pen'd 



[ 344] 



pen'd to us in this tedious and difficult Journey, I 
muft not omit 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us 
Strangers to Spain, were willing to ftay fome time 
to fee the Court of Spain, and to fee what was 
worth obferving ; but it being the latter Part of 
the Summer, we haften'd away, and fet out from 
Madrid about the Middle ofOftober : But when we 
came to the Edge of Navarre, we were alarm'd at 
feveral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that 
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the 
Mountains, that feveral Travellers were obliged 
to come back to P am pel una, after having attem- 
pted, atanextream Hazard, topafson. 

When we came to Pampeluna it felf, we found it 
fo indeed ; and to me that had been always ufed 
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries where 
we could fcarce bear any Cloaths on, the Cold 
was infufferable ; nor indeed was it more painful 
than it was furprifing, to come but ten Days be- 
fore out of the old Caftile where the Weather was 
not only warm but very hot, and immediately to 
feel a Wind from the Pyrenean Mountains, fo ve- 
ry keen, fo feverely cold, as to be intollerable, 
and to endanger benumbing and perilling of our 
Fingers and Toes. 

Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw 
the Mountains all cover'd with Snow, and felt 
cold Weather, which he had never feen or felt 
before in his Life. 

To mend the Matter, when we came to Pam- 
peluna, it continued fnowing with fo much Vio- 
lence, and fo long, that the People faid, Winter 
was come before its time, and the Roads which 
were difficult before, were now quite impaflable : 
For in a Word, the Snow lay in fome Places too 
thick for us to travel ; and being not hard frozen, as 

is 



[ 345 ] 

is the Cafe in Northern Countries : There was no 
going without being in Danger of being bury'd 
alive every Step. We ftay'd no lefs than twenty 
Days at Pampeluna ; when feeing the Winter com- 
ing on, and no Likelihood of its being better; for 
it was the fevered Winter all over Europe that had 
been known in the Memory of Man, I propos'd 
that we fhould all go away ro Fonterabia> and there 
take Shipping for Bourdeaux, which was a very 
little Voyage. 

But while we were confidering this, there came 
in four French Gentlemen, who having been ftopp'd 
on the French Side of the Pafles, as we were on 
the Spanijh y had found out a Guide, who traver- 
fing the Country near the Head of Languedoc, had 
brought them over the Mountains by fuch Ways, 
that they were not much incommoded with the 
Snow ; and where they met with Snow in any 
Quantity, they faid it was frozen hard enough to 
bear them and their Horfes. 

We fent for this Guide, who told us, he would 
undertake to carry us the fame Way with no Ha- 
zard from the Snow, provided we were armed 
fufficiently to protedb our felves from wild Beafts ; 
for he faid, upon thefe great Snows, it was fre- 
quent for fome Wolves to fhow themfelves at the 
Foot of the Mountains, being made ravenous for 
Want of Food, the Ground being covered 
with Snow: We told him, we were well 
enough prepar'd for fuch Creatures as they were, 
if he would enfure us from a Kind of two-legged 
Wolves, which we were told, we were in moft 
Danger from, efpecially on the French Side of the 
Mountains. 

He fatisfy'd us there was no Danger of that kind 
in the Way that we were to go ; fo we readily a- 
greed to follow him, as did alfo twelve other Gen- 
tlemen, 



[346] 



tlemen, with their Servants, fome French, fome Spa- 
nifh ; who, as I faid, had attempted to go, and 
were oblig'd to come back again. 

Accordingly, we all fetout from Pampeluna, with 
our Guide, on the fifteenth of November ; and in- 
deed, I was furpriz'd, when inftead of going for- 
ward, he came diredly back with us, on the fame 
Road that we came from Madrid^ above twenty 
Miles ; when being pafs'd two Rivers, and come 
into the plain Country, we found our felves in a 
warm Climate again, where the Country was plea- 
fant, and no Snow to be ktn ; but on a fudden, 
turning to his left, he approach'd the Mountains 
another Way ; and though it is true, the Hills and 
Precipices look'd dreadful, yet he made fo many 
Tours, fuch Meanders, and led us by fuch wind- 
ing Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the 
Height of the Mountains, without being much 
imcumbred with the Snow ; and all on a fudden, 
he fhew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provinces of Lan- 
guedoc and Gq/coign, all green and flourifhing ; tho' 
indeed it was at a great Diftance, and we had fome 
rough Way to pals yet. 

We were a little uneafy however, when we found 
it fnow'd one whole Day, and a Night, fo faft, 
that we could not travel ; but he bid us be eafy, 
we fliould foon be paft it all : We found indeed, 
that we began to defcend every Day, and to come 
more North than before ; and fo depending upon 
our Guide, we went on. 

It was about two Hours before Night, when 
our Guide being fomething before us, and not juft 
in Sight, out rufhed three monftrous Wolves, and 
after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyn- 
ing to a thick Wood; two of the Wolves flew up- 
on the Guide, and had he been half a Mile before 
us, he had been devour'd indeed, before we could 

have 



[ 347 ] 



have help'd him : One of them faftned upon his 
Horfe, and the other attack'd the Man with that 
Violence, that he had not Time, or not Pi-efence 
of Mind enough to draw his Piftol, but hollow'd 
and cry'd out to us mod luftily ; my Man Friday 
being next me, I bid him ride up, and fee what 
was the Matter ; as fbon as Friday came in Sight 
of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, O Ma- 
Jierl OMafterl But like a bold Fellow, rodedi- 
redtly up to the poor Man, and with his Piftol 
fhot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head. 

It was happy for the poor Man, that it was 
my Man Friday ; for he having been us'd to that 
kind of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon 
him ; but went clofe up to him, and fhot him as 
above ; whereas any of us, would have fir'd at a 
farther Diftance, and have perhaps either mifs'd 
the Wolf, or endanger'd .(hooting the Man. 

But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder 
Man than I, and indeed it alarm'd all our Com- 
pany, when with the Noife of Fridays Piftol, we 
heard on both Sides the difmalleft Howling of 
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Eccho of 
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had 
been a prodigious Multitude of them ; and perhaps 
indeed there was not fuch a Few, as that we had no 
caufe of Apprehenfions. 

However, as Friday had kill'd this Wolf, the o- 
ther that had faftned upon the Horfe, left him im- 
mediately, and fled ; having happily faftned upon 
his Head, where the Boffes of the Bridle had ftuck 
in his Teeth ; fo that he had not done him much 
Hurt : The Man indeed was moft Hurt ; for the 
raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the 
Arm, and the other Time a little above his Knee; 
and he was juft as it were tumbling down by the 

Diforder 



[348] 



Diforder of his Horfe, when Friday came up and 
fliot the Wolf. 

It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the Noife of Fri- 
day's Piftol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as 
faft as the Way (which was very difficult) would 
give us leave, to fee what was the Matter ; as foon 
as we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us 
before, we faw clearly what had been the Cafe, 
and how Friday had difengag'd the poor Guide; 
though we did not prefently difcern what kind of 
Creature it was he had kill'd. 

But never was a Fight manag'd fo hardily, and 
\ in fuch a furprizing Manner, as that which follow'd 
between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all 
(though at firft we were furpriz'd and afraid for 
him) the greateft Diverfion imaginable: As the 
Bear is a heavy, clumfey Creature, and does not 
gallop as the Wolf does, who is fwift, and light ; 
fo he has two particular Qualities, which generally 
are the Rule of his Aftions ; Firft, As to Men, who 
are not his proper Prey ; I fay, not his proper Prey ; 
becaufe tho* Icannot fay what exceffive Hunger might 
do, which was now their Cafe, the Ground being all 
cover'd with Snow ; but as to Men, he does not u- 
fually attempt them, unlefs they firft attack him: 
On the contrary, if you meet him in the Woods, if 
you don't meddle with him, he won't meddle with 
you ; but then you muft take Care to be very Civil 
to him, and give him the Road ; for he is a very 
nice Gentleman, he won't go a Step out of his Way 
for a Prince ; nay, if you are really afraid, your 
beft way is to look another Way, and keep going 
on ; for fometimes if you ftop, and ftand ftill, and 
look, fteadily at him, he takes it for an Affront ; but 
if you throw or tofs any Thing at him, and it hits 
him, though it were but a bit of a Stick, as big as 
your Finger, he takes it for an Aflront, and fets all 

his 



[ 349 ] 



his other Bufinefeafide to purfue his Revenge; for 
he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour ; that 
is his firft Quality: The next is, That if he be once 
affronted, he will never leave you, Night or Day, 
till he has his Revenge; but follows at a good 
round rate, till he overtakes you. 

My Man Fridayhad deliver'd our Guide, and when 
we came up to him, he was helping him off from 
his Horfe ; for the Man was both hurt and frighted, 
and indeed, the laft more than the firft ; when on the 
fudden, we fpy'd the Bear come out of the Wood, and 
a vaft monftrous One it was, the biggeft by far that 
ever I faw : We were all a little furpriz'd, when we faw 
him ; but when Friday faw him, it was eafy to fee 
Joy and Courage in the Fellow's Countenance; Ot 
O! O! Says Friday ', three Times, pointing to him; 
O Mafter ! Tou give me te Leave ! Mejhakee te Hani 
with him : Me make you good laugh. 

I was furpriz'd to fee the Fellow fo pleas'd; Tou 
Fool you, fays I, he will eat you up? Eatee me up I 
Eatee me up! Says Friday, twice over again; Me 
eatee him up: Me make you good laugh : Tou allfiay 
here, me Jhow you good laugh ; fo down he fits, and 
gets his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Pair 
of Pumps (as we call the flat Shoes they wear) and 
which he had in his Pocket, gives my other Servant 
his Horfe, and with his Gun away he flew fwift like 
the Wind. 

The Bear was walking foftly on, and offer'd to 
meddle with no Body, till Friday coming pretty 
near, calls to him, as if the Bear could underftand 
him ; Hark ye, hark ye, fays Friday, me/peakee wit 
you: We folio w'd at a Diftance ; for now being, 
come down on the Gqfcoign fide of the Moun- 
tains, we were entred a vaft great Foreft, where 
the Country was plain, and pretty open, though 
many Trees in it fcatter'd here and three. 

Friday 



[35° J 



Friday, who had as we fay, the Heels of the Bear, 
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great 
Stone, and throws at him, and hit him juft on the 
Head; but did him no more harm, than if he had 
thrown it againft a Wall ; but it anfwer'd Fridays 
End ; for the Rogue was fo void of Fear, that he 
did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and 
{how us fome Laugh as he calPd it. 

As foon as the Bear felt the Stone, and faw him, 
he turns about, and comes after him, taking Devi- 
lifh long Strides, and fhuffling along at a ftrange 
Rate, fo as would have put a Horfe to a midling Gal- 
lop ; away runs Friday, and takes his Courfe, as if 
he run towards us for Help ; fo we all refolv'd to 
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man ; 
though I was angry at him heartily, for bringing 
the Bear back upon us, when he was going about 
his own Bufinefs another Way; and efpecially I 
was angry that he had turn'd the Bear upon us, and 
then run away ; and I call'd out, Tou Dog, faid I, is 
ibis your making us laugh ? Come away, and take your 
Horfe > that we may Jhoot the Creature ; he hears me, 
and crys out, No Jhoot, no /hoot, Jiandftill, you get 
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two 
Foot for the Beaft's one, he turn'd on a fudden, on 
one fide of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for 
his Purpofe, he beckon'd to us to follow, and dou- 
bling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying 
his Gun down upon the Ground, at about five or 
fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree. 

The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we fol- 
low'd at a Diftance ; the firft Thing he did, he 
ftopp'd at the Gun, fmelt to it, but let it lye, and 
up he fcrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Cat, 
though fo monftroufly heavy : I was amaz'd at the 
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could not 
for my Life fee any Thing to laugh at yet, till fee- 
ing 



[35'] 



ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rod nearer 
to him. 

When we came to the Tree, there was Friday / 
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb of the ; 
Tree, and the Bear got about half way to him ; 
as foon as the Bear got out to that part where the 
Limb of the Tree was weaker, Ha, (ays he to us, 
now you fee me teachee the Bear dance ; fo he falls a 
jumping and fhaking the Bough, at which the Bear 
began to totter, but flood ftill, and begun to look 
behind him, to fee how he fhould get back ; then 
indeed we did laugh heartily : But Friday had not 
done with him by a great deal ; when he fees him 
ftand ftill, he calls out to him again, as if he had 
fuppos'd the Bear could fpeak Englijh; What you 
no come farther, pray you come farther; fo he left jump- 
ing and fhaking the Trees ; and the Bear, juft as if 
he had underftood what he faid, did come a little 
further, then he fell a jumping again, and the 
Bear ftopp'd again. 

We thought now was a good time to knock him 
on the Head, and I calTd to Friday to ftand ftill, 
and we would fhoot the Bear; but he cry'd out 
earneftly, pray ! pray I No fhoot , mejhoot, by and 
then ; he would have faid, By and by : However, to 
(horten the Story, Friday danc'd fo much, and 
the Bear flood fo ticklifh, that we had laughing 
enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine what 
the Fellow would do ; for firft we thought he de- 
pended upon fhaking the Bear off; and we found • 
the Bear was too cunning for that too ; for he 
would not go out far enough to be thrown down, 
but clings faft with his great broad Claws and 
Feet, fo that we could not imagine what would 
be the End of it, and where the Jeft would be at 
Jaft 



But 



[35 2 ] 



But Friday put us out of doubt quickly ; for 
feeing the Bear cling faft to the Bough, ' and that 
he would not be perfwaded to come any farther ; 
Well y welly fays Friday \ you no come farther ; me go, 
me go; you no come to me, me go come to you , and upon 
this, he goes out to the fmalleft End of the Bough > 
where it would bend with his Weight, and gently 
lets himfelf down by it, Aiding down the Bough, 
till he came near enough to jump down on his Feet, 
and away he run to his Gun, takes it up, and 
ftands ftill. 

Well, faid I to him Friday, What will you do 
now ? Why don't you fhoot him ? No Jhoot, fays 
Friday, no yet, mejhoot now, me no kill; me ft ay, give 
you one more laugh ; and indeed fo he did, as you 
will fee prefently ; for when the Bear fee his Ene- 
my gone, he comes back from the Bough where he 
flood; but did it mighty leifurely, looking behind 
him every Step, and coming backward till he got 
into the Body of the Tree ; then with the fame 
hinder End foremoft, he came down the Tree,, 
grafping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot 
at a Time, very leifurely ; at this Jundure, andjuft 
before he could fet his hind Feet upon the Ground, 
Friday ftept up clofe to him, clapt the Muzzle of 
his Piece into his Ear, and /hot him dead as a 
Stone. 

Then the Rogue turn'd about, to fee if we did 
not laugh, and when he faw we were pleas'd by 
our Looks, he falls a laughing himfelf very loud ; 
fo we kill Bear in my Country, fays Friday ; fo you 
kill them, fays I, Why you have no Guns : No y 
fays he, no Gun, but /hoot, great much long Arrow. 

This was indeed a good Diverfion to us ; but 
we were ftill in a wild Place, and our Guide very 
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew ; the 
Howling of Wolves run much in my Head ; and in- 
deed,. 



[ 353 ] 



deed, except the Noife I once heard on the Shore 
of Africa, of which I have faid fomething already. 
I never heard any thing that filled me with fo much 
Horrour. 

Thefe things, and the Approach of Night, cal- 
led us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us, 
we ftiould certainly have taken the Skin of this 
monftrous Creature off, which was worth faving ; 
but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide 
haften'd us, fo we left him, and went forward on 
our Journey. 

The Ground was ftill cover'd with Snow, tho* 
not fo deep and dangerous as on the Mountains, 
and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard after- 
wards, were come down into the Foreft and plain 
Country, prefe'd by Hunger to feek for Food ; and 
had done a great deal of Mifchief in the Villages, 
where they furpriz'd the Country People, kill'd a 
great many of their Sheep and Horfes, and fome 
People too. 

We had one dangerous Place to pafs, which 
our Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves 
in the Country, we ihould find them there ; and 
this was in a fmall Plain, furrounded with Woods 
on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane, 
which we were to pafs to get through the Wood, 
and then we fhould come to the Village where we 
were to lodge. 

It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we 
entred the firft Wood ; and a little after Sun-fet, 
when we came into the Plain, we met with no- 
thing in the firft Wood, except, that in a little 
Plain within the Wood, which was not above two 
Furlongs over, we faw five great Wolves crofs the 
Road, full Speed one after another, as if they had 
been in Chafe of fome Prey, and had it in View, 

A a they 



[354] 



they took no Notice of us, and were gone, and 
out of our Sight in a few Moments. 

Upon this our Guide, who by the Way was a 
wretched faint-hearted Fellow, bid us keep in a 
ready Pofture; for he believed there were more 
Wolves a coming. 

We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us, 
but we faw no more Wolves, 'till we came thro* 
that Wood, which was near half a League, and en- 
tred the Plain ; as foon as we came into the Plain, 
we had Occafion enough to look about us : The 
firft Objeft we met with, was a dead Horfe; 
that is to fay, a poor Horfe which the Wolves 
had kilTd, and at leaft a Dozen of them at Work ; 
we could not fay eating of him, but picking of 
his Bones rather ; for they had eaten up all the 
Flefh before. 

We did not think fit to difturb them at their 
Feaft, neither did they take much Notice of 
us: Friday would have let fly at them, but I 
would not fuffer him by any Means ; for I found 
we were like to have more Bufinefs upon our 
Hands than we were aware of. We were not 
gone half over the Plain, but we began to hear the 
Wolves howl in the Wood on our Left, in a fright- 
ful Manner, and prefently after we faw about a 
hundred coming on dire&ly towards us, all in a 
Body, and mod of them in a Line, as regularly as 
an Army drawn up by experienc'd Officers. I 
fcarce knew in what Manner to receive them; 
but found to draw our felves in a clofe Line was 
the only Way : fo we form'd in a Moment : But 
that we might not have too much Interval, I or- 
der'd, that only every other Man fhould fire, and 
that the others who had not fir'd fhonld ftand rea- 
dy to give them a fecond Volley immediately, if 
they continued to advance upon us, and that then 

thofe 



[ 355 ] 



thofe who had fir'd at firft, ftiould not pretend to 
load their Fufees again, but ftand ready with every- 
one a Piftol ; for we were all arm'd with a Fufee, 
and a Pair of Piftols each Man ; fo we were by 
this Method able to fire fix Volleys, half of us at 
a Time ; however, at prefent we had no Neceffi- 
ty ; for upon firing the firft Volley, the Enemy 
made a full Stop, being terrify'd as well with the 
Noife, as with the Fire ; four of them being (hot 
into the Head, dropp'd, feveral others were wound- 
ed* and went bleeding off, as we could fee by the 
Snow : I found they ftopp'd, but did not immedi- 
ately retreat ; whereupon remembring that I had 
been told, that the fierceft Creatures were terri- 
fy'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Com- 
pany to hollow as loud as we could ; and I found 
the Notion not altogether miftaken ; for upon our 
Shout, they began to retire, and turn about ; then 
I order'd a fecond Volley to be fir'd, in their Rear, 
which put them to the Gallop, and away they 
went to the Woods. 

This gave us leifure to charge our Pieces again, 
and that we might loofe no Time, we kept going ; 
but we had but little more than loaded our Fufees, 
and put ourfelves into a Readinefs, when we heard 
a terrible Noife in the fame Wood, on ouf Left, 
only that it was farther onward the fame Way we 
were to go. 

The Night was coming on, and the Light be- 
gan to be dufky, which made it worfe on our Side ; 
but the Noife encreafing, we could eafily perceive 
that it was the Howling and Yelling of thofe hel- 
lifti Creatures ; and on a fudden, we perceiv'd a or 
3 Troops of Wolves, one on our Left, one behind us, 
and one on our Front ; fo that we feem'd to be 
furrounded with 'em ; however, as they did not 
fall upon us, we kept our Way forward, as faft as 

A a 2 we 



[ 35<5 ] 



we could make our Horfes go, which the Way be- 
ing very rough, was only a good large Trot; and 
in this Manner we came in View of the Entrance 
of a Wood, through which we were to pafs, at the 
farther Side of the Plain; but we were greatly fur- 
priz'd, when coming nearer the Lane, or Pafs, we 
faw a confus'd Number of Wolves ftanding juft at 
the Entrance. 

On a fudden, at another opening of the Wood, 
we heard the Noife of a Gun; and looking that 
Way, out rufh'd a Horfe, with a Saddle, and a 
Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and fixteen 
or feventeen Wolves after him, full Speed ; indeed,, 
the Horfe had the Heels of them ; but as we fup- 
pos'd that he could not hold it at that rate, we 
doubted not but they would get up with him at laft, 
and no queftion but they did. 

But here we had a moft horrible Sight ; for ri- 
ding up to the Entrance where the Horfe came out, 
we found the Carcafs of another Horfe, and of two 
Men, devour'd by the ravenous Creatures, and one 
of the Men was no doubt the fame who we heard 
fir'd the Gun ; for there lay a Gun juft by him, fir'd 
off*; but as to the Man, his Head, and the upper 
Part of his Body was eaten up. 

This fill'd us with Horror, and we knew not 
what Courfe to take, but the Creatures refolv'd us 
foon ; for they gather'd about us prefently, in hopes 
of Prey ; and I verily believe there were three hun- 
dred of them : It happen'd very much to our Ad- 
vantage, that at the Entrance into the Wood, but 
a little Way from it, there lay fome large Timber 
Trees, which had been cut down the Summer be- 
fore, and I fuppofe lay there for Carriage ; I drew 
my little Troop in among thofe Trees, and placing 
our felves in a Line, behind one long Tree, I ad- 
vis'd them all to light, and keeping that Tree be- 
fore 



[357] 

fore us, for a Breaft Work, to ftand in a Trian- 
gle, or three Fronts, enclofing our Horfes in the 
Center. 

We did fp, and it was well we did; For never 
was a more furious Charge than the Creatures 
made upon us in the Place ; they came on us with 
a growling kind of a Noife (and mounted the Piece 
of Timber, which as I faid, was our Breaft Work) 
as if they were only rufhing upon their Prey; and 
this Fury of theirs, it feems, was principally occa- 
fion'd by their feeing our Horfes behind us, which 
was the Prey they aim'd at : I order'd our Men to 
fire as before, every other Man ; and they took 
their Aim fo fure, that indeed they kiirdfeveral of 
the Wolves at the firft Volley ; but there was a 
Neceflity to keep a continual Firing; for they 
came on like Devils, thofe behind pufhing on 
thofe before. 

When we had fir'd our fecond Volley of our Fu- 
fees, we thought they ftopp'd a little, and I hop'd 
they would have gone off; but it was but a Mo- 
ment ; for others came forward again ; fo we fir'd 
two Volleys of our Piftols, and I believe in thefe 
four Firings, we had kill'd feventeen or eighteen of 
them, and lam'd twice as many ; yet they came on 
again. 

I was loath to fpend our laft Shot too haftily ; fo 
I calFd my Servant, not my Man Friday; for he was 
better employ'd; for with the greateft Dexterity 
imaginable, he had charg'd my Fufee, and his 
own, while we were engag'd ; but as I faid, I call'd 
my other Man, and giving him a Horn of Powder, 
I bad him lay a Train, all along the Piece of Tim- 
ber, and let it be a large Train ; he did fo, and had 
but juft Time to get away, when the Wolves came 
up to it, and fome were got up upon it; when 
I fnapping an uncharg'd Piftol, clofe to the Pow- 

A a 3 der 



[35«] 



der, fct it on fire ; thofe that were upon the Tim-' 
ber were fcorcht with it, and fix or feven of them 
fell, or rather jump'd in among us, with the Force 
and Fright of the Fire, we difpatch'd thefe in 
an Inftant, and the reft were fo frighted with 
the Light, which the Night, for it was now very- 
near Dark, made more terrible, that they drew 
back a little. 

Upon which I order'd our laft Piftol to be fir'd 
off in one Volley, and after that we gave a Shout ; 
upon this, the Wolves turn'd Tail, and we fally'd 
immediately upon near twenty lame Ones, who 
we found ftruggling on the Ground, and fell a cut- 
ting them with our Swords, which anfwer'd our 
Expe&ation; for the Crying and Howling they 
made, was better underftood by their Fellows, 
fo that they all fled and left us. 

We had, firft and laft, kill'd about three Score 
of them ; and had it been Day-Light, we had 
kilFd many more : The Field of Batde being thus 
clear'd, we made forward again ; for we had ftill 
near a League to go. We heard the ravenous Crea- 
tures houl and yell in the Woods as we went, fe- 
veral Times ; and fometimes we fancy 'd we faw 
fome of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes, 
we were not certain ; fo in about an Hour more, 
we came to the Town, where we were to lodge,, 
which we found in a terrible Fright, and all in 
Arms; for it feems, that the Night before, the 
Wolves and fome Bears had broke into the Village 
in the Night, and put them in a terrible Fright* 
and they were oblig'd to keep Guard Night and 
Day, but efpecially in the Night, to preferve their 
Cattle, and indeed their People. 

The next Morning our Guide was fb ill, and his 
Limbs fwelPd with the rankling of his two Wounds, 
that he could go no farther ; fo we were oblig'd to 

take 



[359] 



take a new Guide there, and go to Tbolou/e, where 
we found a warm Climate, a fruitful pleafant Coun- 
try, and no Snow, no Wolves, or any Thing like 
them ; but when we told our Story at Tboloufe, they 
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the 
great Foreft at the Foot of the Mountains, efpeci- 
ally when the Snow lay on the Ground : But they 
enquir'd much what kind of a Guide we had got- 
ten, that would venture to bring us that Way in 
fuch a fevere Seafbn : and told us, it was very much 
we were not all devour'd. When we told them how 
we plac'd our felves, and the Horfes in the Middle, 
they blam'd us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty 
to one but we had been all deftroy'd ; for it was the 
Sight of the Horfes which made the Wolves fo fu- 
rious, feeing their Prey ; and that at other Times 
they are really afraid of a Gun ; but the being ex- 
ceflive Hungry, and raging on that Account, the 
Eagernefs to come at the Horfes had made them 
fenflefs of Danger ; and that if we had not by the 
continu'd Fire, and at laft by the Stratagem of the 
Train of Powder, mafter'd them, it had been great 
Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces ; where- 
as had we been content to have fat ftill on Horfe- 
back, and fir'd as Horfemen, they would not have 
taken the Horfes for fo much their own, when Men 
were on their Backs, as otherwife; and withal 
they told us, that at laft, if we had flood altoge- 
ther, and left our Horfes, they would have been fo 
eager to have devour'd them, that we might have 
come off fafe, elpecially having our Fire Arms in 
our Hands, and being fo many in Number. 

For my Part, I was never fo fenfible of Danger 
in my Life ; for feeing above three hundred Devils 
come roaring and open mouth'd to devour us, and 
having nothing to flielter us, or retreat to, I gave 
my felf over for loft ; and as it was, I believe, I 

A a 4 ftiall 



[3<5°] 



(hall never care to crofs thofe Mountains again ; I 
think I would much rather go a thoufand Leagues 
by Sea, though I were fure to meet with a Storm 
once a Week. 

I have nothing uncommon to take Notice of, in 
my Paflage through France ; nothing but what o- 
ther Travellers have given an Account of, with 
much more Advantage than I can. I travell'd from 
Bourdeaux to Paris, and without any confiderable 
Stay, came to Callais, and landed fafe at Dover ? the 
fourteenth of January , after having had a feverely 
cold Seafon to travel in. 

I was now come to the Center of my Travels, 
and had in a little Time all my new difcover'd E- 
ftate fafe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I 
brought with me having been very currently paid. 

My principal Guide, and Privy Councellor, was 
my good antient Widow, who in Gratitude for the 
Money I had fent her, thought no Pains too much, 
or Care too great, to employ for me j and I trufted 
her fo entirely with every Thing, that I was per- 
fectly eafy as to the Security of my Effefts ; and in- 
deed, I was very happy from my Beginning, and 
now to the End, in the unfpotted Integrity of this 
good Gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my Effe&s 
with this Woman, and fetting out for Lisbon^ and 
fo to the Brajils ; but now another Scruple came in 
my Way, and that was Religion ; for as I had en- 
tertain'd fome Doubts about the Roman Religion, 
even while I was abroad, efpecially in my State of 
Solitude ; fo I knew there was no going to the Bra- 
jils for me, much lefs going to fetde there, unlefs I 
refolv'd to embrace the Roman Catholick Religion, 
without any Referve ; unlefs on the other hand, I 
refolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my Principles, be a 
Martyr for Religion, and die in the Inquifition ; fo 

Ire- 



[3«i] 



I refolv'd to ftay at Home, and if I could find 
Means for it, to difpofe of my Plantation. 

To this Purpofe I wrote to my old Friend at 
Lisbon, who in Return gave me Notice, that he 
could eafily difpofe of it there : But that if I 
thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my 
Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors of my 
Truftees, who liv'd in the Brafils, who muft fully 
underftand the Value of it, who liv'd juft upon the 
Spot, and who I knew were very rich ; fo that he 
believ'd they would be fond of buying it ; he did 
not doubt, but I fhould make 4 or 5000 Pieces of 
Eight, the more of it, 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer it 
to them, and he did fo ; and in about 8 Months 
more, the Ship being then return'd, he fent me 
Account, that they had accepted the Offer, and 
had remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Cor- 
refpondent of theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it. 

In Return, I fign'd the Inftrument of Sale in the 
Form which they font from Lisbon, and fent it to 
my old Man, who fent me Bills of Exchange for 
328000 Pieces of Eight to me, for the Eftate ; re- 
serving the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to 
him, the old Man, during his Life, and 50 Moi- 
dores afterwards to his Son for his Life, which I 
had promifed them, which the Plantation was to 
make good as a Rent-Charge. And thus I have 
given the firft Part of a Life of Fortune and Ad- 
venture, a Life of Providences Checquer-Work, 
and of a Variety which the World will feldom be 
able to fhow the like of : Beginning foolifhly, but 
clofing much more happily than any Part of it ever 
gave me Leave fo much as to hope for. 

Any one would think, that in this State of com- 
plicated good Fortune, I was paft running any 
more Hazards ; and fo indeed I had been, if other 

Cir- 



t&] 



Circumftances had concurr'd, but I was inur'd to 
a wandring Life, had no Family, not many Rela- 
tions, nor however rich had I contracted much Ac- 
quaintance; and though I had fold my Eftate in 
the Brajils, yet I could not keep the Country out 
of my Head, and had a great Mind to be upon 
the Wing again, efpecially I could not refift the 
ftrong Inclination I had to fee my Ifland, and to 
know if the poor Spaniards were in Being there, 
and how the Rogues I left there had ufed them. 

My true Friend, the Widow, earneftly difwad- 
ed me from it, and fo far prevaiFd with me, that 
for almoft feven Years fhe prevented my running 
Abroad ; during which time, I took my two 
Nephews, the Children of one of my Sifters in- 
to my Care: The eldeft having fomething of 
his own, I bred up as a Gentleman, and gave 
him a Settlement of fome Addition to his Eftate, 
after my Deceafe ; the other I put out to a Cap- 
tain of a Ship; and after five Years, finding 
him a fenfible bold enterprifing young Fellow, I 
put him into a good Ship, and fent him to Sea : 
And this young Fellow afterwards drew me in, as 
old as I was, to farther Adventures my felf. 

In the mean time, I in Part fettled my felf here ; 
for firft of all I marry'd, and that not either to my 
Difadvantage or Diffatisfaftion, and had three 
Children, two Sons and one Daughter : But my 
Wife dying, and my Nephew coming Home with 
good Succefs from a Voyage to Spain, my Inclina- 
tion to go Abroad, and his Importunity prevailed 
and engag'd me to go in his Ship, as a private Trader 
to the Eaji Indies : This was in the Year 1 694. 

In this Voyage I vifited my new Collony in the 
Ifland, faw my Succeflbrs the Spaniards, had the 
whole Story of their Lives, and of the Villains I 
left there ; how at firft they infulted the poor Spa- 
niards, 



C363] 



niards> how they afterwards agreed, difagreed, li- 
nked, feparated, and how at laft the Spaniards 
were oblig'd to ufe Violence with them, how they 
were fubje&ed to the Spaniards, how honeftly the 
Spaniards ufed them ; a Hiftory, if it were entred 
into, as full of Variety and wonderful Accidents, 
as my own Part, particularly alfo as to their Battles 
with the Carribeans, who landed feveral times 
upon the Ifland, and as to the Improvement they 
made upon the Ifland it felf, and how five of 
them made an Attempt upon the main Land, 
and brought away eleven Men and five Women 
Prifbners, by which, at my coming, I found about 
twenty young Children on the Ifland. 

Here I ftay'd about 20 Days, left them Sup- 
plies of all neceflary things, and particularly of 
Arms, Powder, Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two 
Workmen, which I brought from England with 
me, viz. a Carpenter and a Smith. 

Befides this, I fhar'd the Ifland into Parts with 
'em, referv'd to my felf the Property of the whole* 
but gave them fiich Parts refpeftively as they a- 
greed on ; and having fettled all things with them, 
and engaged them not to leave the Place, I left 
them there. 

From thence I touch'd at the Brajilsftom whence 
I fent a Bark, which I bought there, with more 
People to the Ifland, and in it, befides other Sup- 
plies, I fent feven Women, being fuch as I found 
proper for Service, or for Wives to fuch as would 
take them ; As to the Englijb Men, I promis'd them 
to lend them fome Women from England, with a 
good Cargoe. of Neceflaries, if they would apply 
themfelves to Planting, which I afterwards per- 
formed. And the Fellows prov'd very honeft 
and diligent after they were mafter'd, and had 
their Properties fet apart for them. I fent them 

al- 



[ 3*4 ] 

alfo from the Brafils five Cows, three of them be- 
ing big with Calf, feme Sheep, and fome Hogs, 
which, when I came again, were confiderably en- 
creas'cL 

But all thefe things, with an Account how 300 
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruin'd their 
Plantations, and how they fought with that whole 
Number twice, and were at firft defeated, and 
three of them kill'd ; but at laft a Storm deftroying 
their Enemies Cannoes, they famifh'd or deftroy'd 
almoft all the reft, and renew'd and recovered 
the Pofleffion of their Plantation, and ftill liv'd 
upon the Ifland. 

All thefe things, with fome very furprizing In- 
cidents in fome new Adventures of my own, for 
ten Years more, I may perhaps give a farther Ac- 
connt of hereafter,
