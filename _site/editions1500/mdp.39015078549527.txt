for I was fain to dip for t into the Water, a Work which .
fatigued me very much ; after this, I went every Day on

I had been 13 Days on Shore, and had been eleven

What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand, whether

have run our Boat in, or got under the Lee of the Land;

of this appear'd; but as we made nearer and nearer

for I was fain to dip for t into the Water, a Work which .
fatigued me very much ; after this, I went every Day on
board, and brought away what I could get.
I had been 13 Days on Shore, and had been eleven
times on board the Ship; in which Time I had brought

curred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a
