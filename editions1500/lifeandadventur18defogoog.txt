It is scarcely needful to apologise for the appearance of another re- 
print of so universal a favourite as *' Robinson Cbusob ;** a hook which, 
as a matter of course, must have found a place in a series like the pro- 
seat ; — intended to comprise editions, in a neat and convenient form, and 
at a price accessible to all, of many of the standard classics in English 
literature. As fresh g^ierations spring up, and fresh readers arise, so 
fresh editions of such a book as the present will from time to time be 
called for ; and ours is put fbrth in the belief that it will not be found 
an unworthy or unsuccessful competitor for patronage among the youth 
of our land. 

The author of this most attractive work is generally believed to have 
been Daniel Defoe ; whose name may also be known to some of our 
readers as the author of the graphic narrative of ** The Great Plague of 
London.** 

It may not be uninteresting to the juvenile reader to learn that the 
tale of Robinson Crusoe is not altogether fictitious. The individual to 
whose adventures it is supposed to owe its origin was bom at Largo in 
Fifeshire, Scotland, about 1676. His name was Alexander Selkirk. In 
September 1703, he left Cork as the sailing-master of a small vessel 
called the Cinque Ports Oalkyy Charles l*ickering, captain. On the 
ooaat of Brazil, Pickering died, and was succeeded in the command by his 
lieutenant, Thomas Stradling. At the island of Juan Fernandez, Strad- 
ling and Selkirk quarrelled, and the latter resolved, in consequence, to 
stay there alone. When, however, his companions were about to con- 
tinue their voyage, his determination was shaken by the thought of part- 
ing from them and all human society, and he entreated to be taken on 
board ; but his captain would not receive him, and he was left on the 
island with nothing but his clothes and bedding, a firelock, a pound of 
gunpowder, some bullets, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, his books

and mathematical instruments. At first, his dejection was so extreme 
that he could hardly refrain from committing suicide ; and although he 
had plenty of fish, goat^s flesh, turnips, and other yegetables, he never ate 
any thing until hunger absolutely compelled him. Eight months elapsed 
before he became reconciled to his lonely condition. Alter he had over- 
come his melancholy, he diverted himself with cutting his name upon the 
trees, with contrivances to vary and increase his stock of tools, and some- 
times, on clear evenings, with counting the stars. He built two huts of 
unequal size, and at some distance from one another, which he thatched 
with long grass, and lined with goat-skins. In the larger of these hovels 
he slept, read, and offered his devotions ; and he cooked his victuals in 
the smaller. He was at first grievously annoyed by rats; but routed 
these assailants by taming and surrounding himself with a numerous 
bodyguard of the feline race. Selkirk also tamed some kids, and occa- 
sionally varied his amusements by singing to them and teaching them to 
dance. When his powder was exhausted, he chased the goats on foot, 
and with such rapidity that he scarcely ever fidled in catching them. 
His pursuit of one of these animals once nearly cost him his life : he fol- 
lowed the creature with so much eagerness, that he caught it just on the 
brink of a precipice, which he did not perceive, as it was covered with 
bushes ; and he fell to the bottom, where he lay upwards of twenty-four 
hours senseless ; and when he came to himself, found the goat lying dead 
beneath him. It was with great difficulty that he could crawl to his 
dwelling, which was about a mile distant, whence he was unable to stir 
for ten days. When his clothes were worn out, he made a coat and cap 
of goat-skins; these he stitched together with little thongs of the same, 
which he cut with his knife. His only needle was a nail ; and when his 
knife was worn out, he made others of some iron hoops that were ashore, 
which he beat thin, and ground upon stones. He could not succeed i 
making shoes ; but, at last, his feet became so hard, that he ran every 
where without difficulty. Although he constantly prayed at stated hours 
and read aloud, yet when he was taken off the island, his language, from 
disuse of conversation, had become scarcely intelligible, for he seemed 
to speak his words by halves. During his solitary abode in Juan Fer- 
nandez, a period of four years and four months, he saw several ships pass 
by ; but only two came to anchor. These were Spanish vessels, and Sel- 
kirk had great difficulty in escaping from their crews, who, coming very 
near him before he was aware of their approach, not only fired at the 
recluse, but pursued him to the woods, where he climbed into a thick 
tree, at the foot of which they stayed some time, and killed several goats 
just by, but fbrtunately departed without discovering him. 

On the 2d of February, 1709, two ship^ which Selkirk knew to be 



PREFACB. VU 

English, appeared in the bay. He immediately lighted a fire as a signal ; 
and on some of their company landing, he found they were The Duke^ 
Captain Rogers, and The Duchess^ Captain Courtney ; being two pri- 
vateers from Bristol. He gave their officers the best entertainment he 
could provide, and invited them to his retreat ; but the path to it was 
BO very nigged and intricate, that only a very few of them had curiosity 
enough to visit it. Captain Rogers appointed Selkirk master* s-mate of 
the Duke. After a fortnight ^s stay at Juan Fernandez, the ships pro- 
ceeded on their cruise against the Spaniards ; plundered a town on the 
coast of Peru ; took a Manilla ship off California ; and returned by way 
of the East Indies to England, where they arrived on the 1st of October, 
1711. Selkirk stayed in London till ^he got his effects realised ;** and 
then proceeded, in the spring of 1712, to his native village. Largo. For 
a few days, it is narrated, he enjoyed the society of his relatives and. 
friends ; but, from long habit, he soon felt most happy in being alone. 
In the upper part of the garden attached to his fieither^s house, he formed 
a kind of grotto, which commanded a fine and extensive view of the bay 
of Laigo and the shores of the Forth : there, or wandering through a 
secluded valley, called Keil's Den, and fishing in the bay, he spent the 
greater part of his time. After a while, he eloped with a young woman 
named Sophia Bruce ; and went with her to London. Little is known 
of him during the latter portion of his life. He died lieutenant on board 
his Majesty^s ship WeifmmUh^ in 1723.* 

l%e following extract is taken from a note appended to a small col- 
lection of poetry, entitled ^ St. Agnes* Fountain, and other Poems," by 
T. W. Kelly, Esq., to whose politeness we are indebted for the lines 
which close this volume. 

** ' Alexander Selkirk, whose narrative of proceedings on the unin- 
habited island of Juan Fernandez is said to have given rise to Defects 
inimitable work of Robinson Crusoe^ first landed at Baptist Bay, where 
also the &mous navigator Anson hove his ship down. The bay is com- 
modiously situated on the lee-side of the island, having twenty feet water 
three quarters of a mile off shore, and three feet and a half close to the 
beach ; but as the shore is rocky, the operation of landing boats is ren- 
dered dangerous. 

** Bread is the only article of food for which Selkirk could have been 
distressed, were the island then as fertile as it is now ; but could he have 
procured a small quantity of seed, he need not long have felt this incon- 
Tenience, owing to the fertility of the soil. 

^ The island now abounds with wild goats and boais ; there are also 

" See Encyclopaedia Britannics, Cooke's Voyages, &c. 



VUl PRBFACE* 

oxen and horses on it. Wild fowl and small birds are numerous ; wood- 
pigeons of a large kind are very plentiful. In the valleys are fruit-trees 
of various descriptions, such as the apple, pear, peach, quince, cherry, 
and fig, in a flourishing state. In the hollows between the ridges of moun- 
tains, there are several springs or falls of water, which run a distance of 
three or four miles, shaded on each side by the above-mentioned trees. 
Peaches seem most abundant, and grapes are found in some parts. 
Radishes, turnips, potatoes, and other vegetables, are growing wild about 
the island. 

*^ Wood is found, of various species, some peculiar to the place. 
There is a vast number of myrtle and box-trees on the heights. The 
ridges of the mountains are very narrow and dangerous to pass ; they are 
also difficult of ascent and descent, and Selkirk must have found them 
80 in chasing the goats which frequented these heights. 

** A resident on this island might procure fruit enough in one season, 
dried or otherwise preserved, to supply him for seven years. The fruits 
were not ripe on our arrival, except figs and a rich yellow fruit, about 
the size and shape of a Siberian crab ; the latter of which were perfectly 
ripe, and pleasant to eat. Of these, with apples, we made puddings and 
pies. 

^ The cave made by Selkirk is situated near the place where an 
American, in voluntary exile, erected his dwelling and store-huts. He 
had with him a boat^s crew, consisting of six men, natives of Otaheite, a 
whale-boat and a canoe ; and his occupation was fishing. The fish he 
dried and salted, and sent to Valparaiso and other places by small 
Vessels trading with him ; he receiving, in exchange, provisions and 
money. In this cave, where Robinson Crusoe is said to have dwelt, a 
musician of that name, belonging to our ship, left a memorial of our 
visit, with the date, which also stated that it was placed there by Robin- 
ion Crusoe. This may excite wonder in friture visitors, and they, per- 
haps, may doubt the veracity of our statement, thinking we have claimed 
the privilege of travellers, namely, dealing too largely in the marvellous. 
Leaving them to their doubts, I may truly say that I was in the ship 
which brought a Robinson Crusoe from the island of Joan Fernandez. 

*' I had nearly omitted to mention that we procured a large quantity 
of wood for firing. Although the water here is excellent, watering is still 
difficult, for want of a convenient place in which boats might run up. 
Ships do water here, but they incur great risk of staving their boats.* 

** This note was selected from an unpublished manuscript diary, or 
* Memoranda and Observations,* written by Wm. Harris, a very intelli- 
gent seaman (formerly on board His Britannic Majesty *s ship Doris), 
between January 27th, 1825, and June 27th, 1829.'

PREPAOB. IX 

It need hardly be said, that the resemblance between the history of 
Selkirk and that of Crusoe is of a very general kind. Even the locality- 
is not at all the same. Juan Fernandez is a solitary island on the coast 
of Chib', with no other near it ; while Crusoe^s abode is placed in the 
Caribbean group, in quite a different region of the world. Still, consider- 
ing that Defoe*s tale appeared only a few years after Selkirk^s return, 
there can be little doubt that the idea of it was suggested to him by the 
adventures of the latter. 

It remains to say a few words in reference to the present edition of 
Crusoe. But little editorial revision was of course required. The first 
part, indeed, may be said to have needed only such minor changes as 
tended to perspicuity and grammatical correctness — such as occasionally 
breaking up Defoe*s long and often badly-constructed sentences — and 
paring away a few of the more glaring instances of tautology. This, 
however, has been done in such a manner as to preserve that quaintness 
of style with which the charm of the book is so inseparably connected. 
In the second part more liberty was allowable. It is confessedly inferior 
to the first ; so much so, as to have given rise to the opinion, that it was 
not the production of the same author. However this may be, there 
seems little doubt that it was got up mainly to sell on the credit of its 
predecessor; and, judging from internal evidence, one would say that in 
the later portions of the book, the story was eked out simply in order to 
swell it to the same bulk as the previous part. The commencement, on 
the whole, does not disappoint us; we feel our sympathies so identified 
with '' the island," and all connected with it, that we enter eagerly into 
the adventures of the Spaniards and Englishmen — their domestic broils — 
their battles with the savages — the increase of their settlement, &c. &c. 
The interest, indeed, may be said to be very &irly kept up as long as 
the island is the chief scene on the canvass. But after Crusoe '* has done 
with the island," as he expresses it, we feel that we have nearly done 
with him ; and when poor honest Friday dies so unexpectedly, to the grief 
and regret of every reader, most of us have felt disposed to drop a tear to 
his memory, and there close the book. Notwithstanding this, however, 
we have not felt ourselves at liberty to omit the later portions, or to 
make what is called an ** abridged Crusoe ;" so that the reader will, as 
usual, accompany him to Madagascar, the Persian Gulf, the Moluccas, 
China, Tartary, Russia, and thence by Hamburgh to England; leav- 
ing him there — as all former readers have — ^* resolved to prepare for a 
longer journey than all these, having lived a life of infinite variety for 72 
years.^' All that we have done has been to relieve this portion of some- 
what of its prolixity, so as to enable the juvenile reader to glide on with 



Z PRBVACB. 

a little more ease and pleasure ; siinply to omit, in fkct, snch minor 
details as the young are always known to skip over, and which, even 
when they become older, they see to be of no interest or yalue. The 
whole has also been divided into chapters ; which, with the table of 
contents, will, it is hoped, be found to add to the conyenience of the 
reader.

2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the will, nay the commands, of my father, and ap:ainst all the 
entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex- 
cellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He 
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined 
by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon the 
subject : he asked me what reasons more than a mere wandering 
inclination I had for leaving my father's house and my native 
countrv, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect 
of raising my fortune by application and industry. He told me 
it was for men of desperate fortunes on the one hand, or of aspir- 
ing superior fortunes on the other, to go abroad upon adventures, 
to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertak- 
ings of a nature out of the common road ; that these things were 
all either too far above me, or too far below me ; that mine was the 
middle state of life, which he had found by long experience was 
the best, the most suited to human happiness ; not exposed to the 
miseries and hardships, the labour and sufierings of the mechanic 
part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxurv, 
ambition, and envy of the upper part. He told me, I might 
judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing, viz. that 
this was the state of life which all other people envied ; that kings 
have frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being 
born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the 
middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great ; 
that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the just stan- 
dard of true felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty 
nor riches. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affec- 
tionate manner, not to precipitate myself into miseries which 
nature and the station of life I was born in seemed to have 
provided against : that I was under no necessity of seeking my 
bread ; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter 
me fairly into the station of life which he had been just recom- 
mending to me ; and that if I was not very easy and happy 
in the world, it must be my fault that must hinder it, and that 
he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his 
duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be 
to my hurt : in a word, that as he would do very kind things for 
me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would 
not have so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me any 
encouragement to go away. To close all, he told me I had my 
elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same 
earnest persuasions to keep nim from going into the Low Country 
wars, but could not prevail, his youn^ desires prompting him to 
run into the army, where he was killed. And though he said he 
would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to 
me^ that if I did take this foolish step, I would have to reticct

upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to 
assist in my recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his dificourse, virhich was truly 
prophetic, though I suppose my ikther did not know it to be so 
himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plen- 
tifully, and especially when he spoke of my brother who was 
killed ; and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, 
and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke off the 
discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more 
to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, — as, indeed, who 
could be otherwise ? and I resolved not to think of going abroad 
any more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. 
But, alas, a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent 
any of my father's further importunities, in a few weeks after, I 
resolved to run quite away from him. However, I did not act so 
hastily neither as my first heat of resolution prompted ; but I took 
my mother, at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than 
ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were so entirely bent 
upon seeing the world, that I should never settle to any thing at 
home, and my father had better give me his consent than force 
me to go without it ; that I was now eighteen years old, which 
was too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; 
that I was sure, if 1 did, I should never serve out my time, and I 
should certainly run away from my master before my time was 
out, and go to sea ; and if she would speak to my father to let me 
go but one voyage abroad, if I came home a^in and did not like 
it, I would go no more, and I would promise by a double dili- 
gence to recover that time I had lost. 

This made my mother very angry ; she told me she knew it 
would be to no purpose to speak to my father on the subject; and 
that she wondered how I could think of any such thine after such 
kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to 
me ; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help 
for me ; but I might depend 1 should never have their consent to 
it, and I should never have it to say, that my mother was willing 
when my father was not. 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, 
though in the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all pro- 
posaLi of settling to business. But being one day at Hull, where 
I went casually, and without any purpose of making an elope- 
ment that time, and one of my companions being about to go by 
sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with 
them, with the common allurement of seafannff men, viz. that it 
should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father 
or mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it ; but 
leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's 
blessing, or my father's, without any conslderatioxL q^ ^vt^^ox^* 



4 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

stances or consequences, on the first of September 1661, 1 went on 
board a ship bound for London. 

The ship was no sooner gotten out of the- Humber, than the 
wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a frightful manner ; 
and as 1 bad never been at sea before, I was inexpressibly sick in 
body, as well as terrified in mind. I began now to reflect upon 
what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment 
of Heaven for wickedly leaving my father's house, and abandoning 
my duty ; all the good counsel of my parents, my father's tears 
and my mother's entreaties, came now fresh into my mind, and 
my conscience reproached me with the contempt of that advice, 
and the breach of my duty to God and my father. 

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very 
high, though nothing like what I have seen many times since, 
no, nor like what I saw a few days after ; but it was enough to 
affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known 
any thing of the matter. I expected every wave would have 
swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down in the 
trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more ; and in 
this agony of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that 
if it would please God to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I 
got my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home, and 
never set it into a ship a^ain wnile I lived. Now I saw plainly 
the goodness of my father^ observations about the middle station 
of life, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had 
been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I 
resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, return 
home. 

These thoughts continued all the while the storm continued, 
and indeed sometime after ; but the next day the wind abated and 
the sea was calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it ; how- 
ever, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick 
still ; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was 
quite over, and a charming evening followed ; the sun went down 
perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning ; and having little 
or no wind, and a smooth sea, with the sun shining upon it, the 
sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw. 

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, 
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so 
rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so 
pleasant in so little time after. But now, lest my good resolu- 
tions should continue, my companion who had enticed me away 
comes to me, " Well, Bob," says he (clapping me on the shoul- 
der), "how do you do? I warrant vou were frighted, wasn't you, 
last night, when it blew but a cap full of wind ?" "A cap full, do 
you call it ?" said I, " it was a terrible storm !" ** A storm, you 
fool," replies he, "do you call that a storm ? why, it was nothing 
at all ; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think no- 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 5 

thing of such a squall of wind as that. But you're but a fresh- 
water sailor, Bob ; come, let us make a bowl of punch, and \\e*\l 
forget all that. Do you see what charming weather it is now ?" 
To make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way of 
all sailors ; the punch was made, and in that one night's wicked-* 
ness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my 
past conduct, and all my resolutions for my future. In a word, 
as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled 
calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my 
thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal- 
lowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my 
former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises 
that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of 
reflection, and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to 
return again sometimes, but I shook them ofl*, and roused myself 
from them as it were from a distemper; and applying myself to 
drink and company, soon mastered the return of those fits, for so 
I called them ; and I had in five or six days got as complete a 
victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to 
be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have another trial 
for it still ; and Providence, as in such cases it generally does, 
resolved to leave me entirely without excuse. For if I would not 
take this for a deliverance, the next was to be one of which the 
worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both 
the danger and the mercy. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth 
Boads ; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm, 
we had made but little way since the storm. We were obliged 
to come to an anchor; and here we lay, the wind continuing con- 
trary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eiffht days, during which 
time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same 
roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a 
wind for the river. 

We had not, however, rid here so long, but that the wind blew 
too fresh ; and after we had lain four or five days it blew very 
hard. However, the roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, 
the anchorage good, and our ground -tackle very strong, our men 
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, 
but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of sailors ; 
but on the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we 
had all hands at work to strike our top-masts, and make every 
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. 
By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rid fcfre- 
castle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our 
anchor had come home ; upon which our master ordered out the 
sheet-anchor ; so that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the 
cables veered out to the better end. 

Bv this time it blew a terrible storm*, widlXie^^Tv \a ^^^

terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. 

The master, though he was vigilant in the business of preserving 

the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin, I could hear him 

softly to himself say several times, '^ Lord, be merciful to us ! we 

shall be all lost, we shall be all undone ;" and the like. When I 

heard this, I was dreadfully frightened ; I got up out of my cabin, 

and looked out ; but such a dismal sight I never saw ; the sea went 

mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes; 

when I could look about, I could see nothing but distress round 

us ; two ships that rid near us, we found, had cut their masts by 

the board, being deeply laden ; and our men cried out, that a ship 

which rid about a mile a-head of us was foundered. Two more 

ships being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads 

to sea, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships fared 

the best, as not so much labouring in the sea ; but two or three 

of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only 

their spritsail out before the wind. 

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master 
of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was 
very unwilling to do ; but the boatswain protesting to him that 
if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented ; and when 
they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, 
and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away 
also, and make a clear deck. 

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, 
who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a friglit 
before at but a little. But if I can express at this distance the 
thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more 
horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the 
having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly 
taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the 
terror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that I can by 
no words describe it. But the worst was not come yet; the 
storm continued with such fury, that the seamen themselves 
acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a good 
ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that 
the seamen every now and then cried out, she would founder. It 
was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they 
meant by founder, till I inquired. However, the storm was so 
violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master, the boat- 
swain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their 
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to 
the bottom. In the middle of the night, one of the men that had 
been down on purpose to see, cried out, we had sprung a leak : 
another said there were four feet of water in the hold. Then all 
hands were called to the pump. At that word my heart died 
within me, and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where 
I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me 



CH. t. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 7 

that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to 
pump as another ; at which I stirred up, and went to the pump 
and worked very heartily. While this was doing, the master 
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm, 
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not come 
near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew 
not what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the ship 
had broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was 
so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time 
when every body had his own life to think of, nobody minded 
me, or what was become of me; but another* man stepped up 
to the pump, and, thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, 
thinking I had been dead ; and it was a great while before I came 
to myself. 

We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was 
apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm 
began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could float 
till we might run into a port, so the master continued firing guns 
for help ; and a light ship who had rid it out just a-head of us, 
ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard 
the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on 
board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side ; till at last, the 
men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, 
our men cast them a rope over the stem with the buoy to it, and 
then veered it out a sresi length, which they, after great labour 
and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our 
stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them 
or us after we were in the boat to think of reachmg their own 
ship, so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in to- 
wards shore as much as we could; and our master promised them, 
that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good to 
their master ; so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went 
away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as 
Winterton-Ness. 

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our 
ship before we saw her sink ; and then I understood for the first 
time what was meant by a ship foundering at sea. I must ac- 
knowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told 
me she was sinking ; for n*om that moment they rather put me 
into the boat than I might be said to go in, for my lieart was 
as it were dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror 
of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me. ^ 

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the 
oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see a great many 
people running along the shore to assist us when we should come 
near; but we made but slow way, nor were we able to reach the 
land till^ being past the light-house at Winterton, the shore falls 



8 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke oflF a 
little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and, though not 
without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked after- 
wards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were 
used with great humanity, as well by the ma^strates of the town 
as by particular merchants and owners of ships ; and had money 
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, 
as we thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have 
gone home, I had been happy ; and my father, an emblem of him 
in our blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf 
for me ; but hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in 
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had any assur- 
ance that I was not drowned. 

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who 
was the master's son, was now less forward than I. The first time 
he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till 
two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several 
quarters ; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone 
was altered ; and looking very melancholy, and shaking his 
head,- he asked me how I did, telling his father who I was, and 
how I had come this voyage for a trial. His father, turning to 
me with a very grave and concerned tone, " Young man," says 
he, " you ought never to go to sea any more ; you ought to take 
this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafar- 
ing man." " Why, sir," said I, "will you go to sea no more?" 
" That is another case," said he ; " it is my calling, and therefore 
my duty ; but as you made this voyage for a trial, you see what 
a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you 
persist; perhaps this is all befallen us on your account, like 
Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray," continued he, '* what are 
you? and on what account did yo\j go to sea?" Upon that I 
told him some of my story, at the end of which he exclaimed, 
" What had I done," says he, '* that such an unhappy wretch 
should come into my ship ! I would not set my foot in the same 
ship with thee again for a thousand pounds." This indeed was a 
sudden burst of passion while he was agitated by the sense of his 
loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go. How- 
ever, he afterwards talked very sensibly and gravely to me, ex- 
horted me to go back to my father, and not tempt Providence 
to my ruin ; told me I might see a visible hand of Heaven 
against me; "And, young man," said he, "depend upon it, if 
you do not go back, wherever you go you will meet with no- 
thing but disasters and disappointments^ till your father's words 
are fulfilled upon you." 

We parted soon after, for I made him little answer, and I 
saw him no more ; which way he went I know not. As for me, 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 9 

haying some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by 
land ; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles 
with myself what course of life I should take, and whether I 
should go home, or go to sea. 

As to going home, shame opposed the best thoughts that 
offered themselves to my mind ; and it immediately occurred to 
me how I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should 
be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but every 
body else ; from whence I have since often observed, how irra- 
tional the common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, 
viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to 
repent ; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to 
be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only 
can make them be esteemed wise men. 

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncer- 
tain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An 
irresistible reluctance continued to going home ; and as I stayed 
a while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off; 
and as that abated, the little desire I had to a return wore off 
with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked 
out for another voyage. 

That evil influence which carried me first away from my 
father's house, and hurried me into the wild and indigested no- 
tion of raising my fortune, presented the most unfortunate of all 
enterprises to my view : and I went on board a vessel bound to 
the coast of Africa ; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it, a voyage 
to Guinea. 

It was my ffteat misfortune that in all these adventures I did 
not ship myselt as a sailor, whereby, though I might indeed have 
worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I should 
have learned the duty and office of a fore-mast man, and in time 
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a 
master : but as it was always my habit to choose for the worse, 
so I did here ; for, having money in my pocket, and good 
clothes upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit 
of a gentleman, and so I neither had any business in the ship, or 
learned to do any. 

It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty good company in 
London, which does not always happen to such young fellows as 
I then was, the devil generally not omitting to lay some snare 
for them very early ; but it was not so with me. I became 
acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on the 
coast of Guinea ; and who, having had very good success there, 
was resolved to go again ; he, taking a fancy to my conversa- 
tion, and hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told 
me, if I would go the voyage with him I should be at no ex- 
pense — I should be his messmate and his companion ; and if I 
could carry any thing with me, I should have sdl the advantage 



10 LIFE AND AOVENTT7RE8 

of it that the trade would admit ; and, perhaps, I might meet 
with some encouragement. 

I embraced the offer; and entering into a strict friendship 
with this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man, 1 
went the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with 
me, which, by the disinterested honesty of my friend, I increased 
very considerably ; for I carried about 40/. in such toys and 
trifles as the captain directed me to buy. This 40Z, I had mus- 
tered together by the assistance of some of my relations whom 
I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or, 
at least, my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first 
adventure. 

This was the only voyage which 1 may say was successful in 
all my adventures, and which I owe to the assistance of my friend 
the captain, under whom also 1 got a competent knowledge of 
mathematics and of navigation, learned how to keep an account 
of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short, to under- 
stand some things that were needful to be understood by a 
sailor ; jfor, as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to 
learn ; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a 
merchant : for I brought home 6 pounds 9 ounces of gold-dust 
for my adventure, which yielded me in London, at my return, 
almost 300/. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and the captain, to 
my great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to 
go the same voyage again ; and I embarked in the same vessel 
with one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now 
got the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest voyage 
that ever man made ; for, though I did not carry quite 100/. of 
my new-gained wealth, so that I had 200/. left, and which I 
lodged with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I 
fell into terrible misfortunes in this voyage. 

The first was this : Our ship, making her course towards the 
Canary Islands, or rather between those islands and the African 
shore, was surprised, in the grey of the morning, by a Turkish 
rover of Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she could 
make. We crowded also as much canvass as we could carry, to 
have got clear ; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and 
would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to 
fight: our ship having 12 guns, and he 18. About three in the 
afternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by mistake, just 
athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our stern, as he intended, 
we brought eight of our guns to bear on that side, and poured in 
a broadside upon him, which made him sheer off again, after 
returning our nre, and pouring in also his small shot from near 
200 men which he had on board. However, we had not a man 
touched, all our crew keeping close. He prepared to attack us 
again, and we to defend ourselves ; but laying us on board the 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 11 

next time upon our other quarter, he entered 60 men upon our 
decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking the decks 
and rigging. We plied them with small shot, half-pikes, powder- 
chests, and such like, and cleared our deck of them twice. How- 
ever, to cut short liiis melancholy part of our story, our ship 
being disabled, and three of our men killed, and eight wounded, 
we were obliged to yield, and were carried all prisoners into 
Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors. 

The usage I had there was not so bad as at first I appre- 
hended ; nor was I carried up the country to the emperor s 
court, as the rest of our men were, but was kept by the captain 
of the rover, as his proper prize, and made his slave, being 
young and nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising 
change of my circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable 
slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now I looked back 
upon my Other's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be 
miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I thought was 
now so effectually brought to pass that I could not be worse ; 
that now the hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I was 
undone without redemption. 

As my new master had taken me home to his house, so I was 
in hopes that he would take me with him when he went to sea 
again, believing that it would some time or other be his fate to be 
captured by a Spanish or Portuguese man-of-war, and that then 
I should be set at liberty. But this hope was soon taken away ; 
for when he went to sea, he left me on shore to look after his 
garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves about his house ; 
and when he came home again from his cruise, he ordered me to 
lie in the cabin to look after the ship. 

Here I meditated nothing but my escape, and what method 
I might take to effect it, but found no way that had the least 
probabilitv in it, for I had nobody to communicate it to that 
would emoark with me ; so that for two years, though I often 
pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the least 
prospect of putting it in practice. 

After about two years, an odd circumstance presented itself 
which put the thought again in my head. My master lying at 
home longer than usual, without fitting out his ship, used, once 
or twice a week, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pin- 
nace, and go out into the road a-fishing, and as he always took 
rae and a young Maresco with him to row the boat, we made 
him#very merry ; and I proved very dexterous in catching fish, 
insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a M(X)r, one of 
his kinsmen, and the vouth, the Maresco as they called him, to 
catch a dish offish for him. 

It happened one time that, going a-fishing in a calm morn- 
ing, a fog rose, so thick that, though we were not half a league 
from the shore, we lost sight of it ; and rowing we kue^ woXi 



12 LIFE AND ADYBNTURES 

whither, we laboured all day and all the next night, and when 
the morning came, we found we had pulled off to sea instead of 
])ulling in lor the shore, and that we were at least two leagues 
from land ; however, we got well in again, though with a great 
deal of labour, and some danger, for the wind began to blow 
pretty fresh in the morning ; but, particularly, we were all very 
hungry. 

Our master, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more 
care of himself for the future ; and having lying by him the 
long boat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved he 
would not go a-fishing any more without a compass and some 
provision ; so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was 
an English slave, to build a little state-room or cabin in the 
middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to 
stand behind it to steer and hale home the main-sheet, and room 
before for a hand or two to stand and work the sails : she sailed 
with what we call a shoulder-of-mutton sail ; and the boom 
gibed over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and low, 
and had in it room for him to lie, with a slave or two, and a 
table to eat on, with small lockers to put in some bottles of such 
liquor as he thought fit to drink, and particularly his bread, rice, 
and coffee. 

We went frequently out with this boat a-fishing ; and as I 
was most dexterous in catching fish for him, he never went 
without me. It happened that he had appointed to go out in 
this boat, either for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors 
of some distinction in that place, and had therefore sent on board 
the boat, over night, a larger store of provisions than ordinary, 
and had ordered me to get ready three fusees with powder and 
shot, which were on board his ship, for that they designed some 
sport of fowling as well as fishing. 

I got all things ready, and waited the next morning with the 
boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants out, and every 
thing to accommodate his guests ; when, by and by, my patron 
came on board alone, and told me his guests had put off going, 
upon some business that fell out ; and ordered me, with the man 
and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and catch them some 
fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house : all which I 
prepared to do. 

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into 
my thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at 
my command ; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish 
myself, not for a fishing business, but for a voyage ; though I 
knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I should 
steer, for to get out of that place any how was my object. 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this 
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board, for I told 
him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread. He said 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 13 

that was true ; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit of 
their kind, and three jars with fresh water, into the boat. I knew 
where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was evident by 
the make were taken out of some English prize ; and I conveyed 
them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if they had 
been there before for our master, I conveyed also a great lump 
of bees' wax into the boat, which weighed above half a hundred 
weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a 
hammer, all of which were of great use to us afterwards, espe- 
cially the wax, to make candles. Another trick I tried upon 
him, which he innocently came into also : his name was Ismael, 
whom they call Muly or Moley ; so I called to him ; — " Muly," said 
I, " our patron's guns are on board the boat ; can you not get 
a little powder and shot ? it may be we may kill some alcamies 
(a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves; for I know he keeps 
the gunner's stgres in the ship." " Yes," says he, " I'll bring 
some ;" and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch, which 
held about a pound and a half of powder, or rather more, and 
another with shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, 
and put all into the boat ; at the same time I had found some 
powder of my master's in the great cabin, with which I filled 
one of the large bottles in the case, which was almost empty, 
pouring what was in it into another ; and thus furnished with 
every thing needful, we sailed out of the port. We were not 
above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and 
set us down to fish : the wind blew from the n.n.e., which was 
contrary to my desire, for had it blown southerly I had been 
sure to have made the coast of Spain, and at least reached to 
the bay of Cadiz ; but my resolutions were, blow which way it 
would, I would be eone from that horrid place. 

After we had fished some time and caught nothing, for when 
I had fish on my Hook I would not pull them up, that he might 
not see them, I said to the Moor, " This will not do : our master 
will not be thus served ; we must stand farther ofi:" He, thinking 
no harm, agreed, and being in the head of the boat set the sails ; 
and as I had the helm, I run the boat out near a league farther, 
and then brought her to as if I would fish ; when, giving the boy 
the helm, I stept forward to where the Moor was, and making 
as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by surprise 
with my arm under his twist, and tossed him clear overboard 
into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a cork, and 
calling to me, begged to be taken in, telling me he would go all 
over the world with me ; he swam so strong after the boat, that 
he would have reached me very quickly, there being but little 
wind ; upon which I stept into the cabin, and fetching one of the 
fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I had done 
him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none ; 
*• You swim well enough," said I, ** to reach tVie XwaA.^^Ti'i "vJvi^ 





14 LIFE AND ADVKNTUBES 

sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore, and I will do 
you no harm ; but if you come near the boat I'll shoot you 
through the^head." So he turned himself about, and swam for 
the shore ; and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, for 
he was an excellent swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor with me, 
but I dared not trust him. When he was gone I turned to the 
boy, whom they called Xury, and said to him, " Xury, if you will 
be faithful to me I'll make you a great man ; but if you will not 
stroke your face to be true to me," (that is, swear by Mahomet 
and his father's beard,) " I must throw you into the sea too." 
Upon this, the boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently 
that I could not mistrust him ; he swore to be faithful to me, and 
go all over the world with me. 

While I was in view of the Moor, I stood out directly to sea 
with the boat, rather stretching to windward, that they might think 
me gone towards the Straits' mouth (as indeed any one that had 
been in their wits must have been supposed to do), for who would 
have supposed we should sail on to the southward to the Barba- 
rian coast, where whole nations of negroes were sure to surround 
us with their canoes, and destroy us ; where we could not once 
go on shore but we should be devoured by savage beasts, or more 
merciless savages of human kind ? 

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my 
course, and steered directly south by east, bending a little 
toward the east, that I might keep in with the shore ; and hav- 
ing a fair gale of wind, and a smooth sea, I made such sail 
that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, 
when I first made the land, I could not be less than 150 miles 
south of Sallee ; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's domin- 
ions, or, indeed, of any other king thereabouts, for we saw no 
people. 

Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the 
dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I 
would not go on shore, or come to an anchor. The wind con- 
tinuing fair till I had sailed five days, and then shifting to the 
southward, I concluded that if any of our vessels were in chase of 
me, they also would now give over ; so I ventured to make to the 
coast, and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew 
not what, or where ; I neither saw, or desired to see any people ; 
the principal thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into 
this creek in the evening, resolving to swim on shore and dis- 
cover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard 
such dreadful noises of the barking and howling of wild crea- 
tures of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was ready 
to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till day. 
" Well, Xury," said I, " then I won't ; but it may be we may see 
men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions." ** Then 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 15 

we give them the shoot gun," says Xury, laughing ; '^ make them 
run wey." I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him 
a dram to cheer him up : after all, Xury's advice was good, and I 
took it ; we dropped our little anchor and lay still all night ; I 
say still, for we slept none ; for in two or three hours we saw 
great creatures (we knew not what to call them) of many sorts, 
come down to the sea-shore and run into the water, wallowing 
and washing themselves ; and they made such hideous howlings 
and yellings, that I never heard the like. 

Xury was dreadfully frightened, and so, indeed, was I ; but we 
were both more alarmed when we heard one of these creatures 
come swimming towards our boat : we could not see him, but we 
might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous and furious 
beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might be so for ought I 
know; but poor Xury cried to me to weigh anchor and row 
away. ** No," says I, " Xury, we can slip our cable with a buoy 
to it, and go oflP to sea, for they cannot follow us far." I had no 
sooner said so, than I perceived the creature within two oars' 
length, which something surprised me ; however, I immediately 
slept to the cabin-door, and taking up my gun, fired at him, 
upon which he immediately turned about, and swam towards 
the shore. 

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hide- 
ous cries and bowlings, that were raised, as well upon the edge 
of the shore, as higher up the country, upon the noise or report 
of the gun ; a thing I believe those creatures had never heard be- 
fore. This convinced me that there was no going on shore for us 
in the night upon that coast, and how to venture on shore in the 
day was a question too ; for to have fallen into the hands of any 
of the savages, had been as bad as to have fallen into the hands of 
lions and tigers. ^ 

However, we irere obliged to go on shore somewhere or other 
for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat ; but when or 
where to get it was the question. Xury said, if I would let him 
go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there was any 
water, and bring some to me. I asked him why he would go ? 
why I should not go, and he stay in the boat? The boy answered 
witn so much affection that he made me love him ever after, " If 
wild mans come, they eat me ; jou go wey." " Well, Xury," 
said I, "we will both go; and if the wild mans come, we will 
kill them, and they shaU eat neither of us." So we hauled the 
boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper, and waded 
on shore ; carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water. 

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the com- 
ing of canoes with savages down the river : but the boy seeing a 
low place about a mile up the country rambled to it ; and by and 
by I saw him come running towards me. I thought he was pur- 
sued by some savage, or wild beast, and I ran K)rwacd t(^ Wv^ 



16 LIFE AND ADYENTUBEB 

him ; but when I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging 
over his shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a 
hare, but different in colour, and longer legs ; however, we were 
very glad of it, and it was very good meat ; but the good news that 
poor Xury came with was, to tell me he had found water, and 
seen " no wild mans." 

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for 
water ; for a little higher up the creek where we were, we found 
the water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little 
way up ; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the animal we had 
killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps 
of any human creature. 

As I had been one voyage to this doast before, I knew very 
well that the Canary and Cape de Verd islands lay not far off 
from the coast. But as 1 had no instruments by which to discover 
what latitude we were in, I knew not where to look for them, or 
when to stand off to sea towards them ; otherwise I might now 
easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was, that 
if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the Eng- 
lish traded, I should find some of their vessels, that would relieve 
and take us in. 

By the best of my calculation, the place where I now was, 
must be that country which, lying between the Emperor of Mo- 
rocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, 
except by wild beasts, the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone 
farther south for fear of the Moors ; and the Moors not thinking 
it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness ; and indeed both 
forsaking it because of the prodigious number of tigers, lions, 
leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour there. The 
Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an army, 
two or three thousand men at a time ; and indeed for near an 
hundred miles together upon this coast, we sftw nothing but a 
waste uninhabited country by day ; and heard nothing but howl- 
ing and roaring of wild beasts by night. 

Once or twice in the day-time I thought I saw the Pico of 
Teneriffe, being the high top of the mountain Teneriffe in the 
Canaries; and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of 
reaching thither ; but having tried twice, I was forced in a^in 
by contrary winds, the sea also running too high for my little 
vessel ; so 1 resolved to pursue my first design, and k^ep along the 
shore. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we 
had left this place ; and once in particular, early in the morning, 
we came to anchor under a little point of land which was pretty 
high, and the tide begining to flow, we lay still to go farther in. 
Xury, whose eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, 
called softly to me, and told me that we had best go farther off 
the shore; "for," said he, ** yonder lies a dreadful monster, on 



CH. I. 07 BOBINSON CBUSOE. 17 

the side of that hillock, fast asleep." I looked where he pointed, 
and saw a dreadful monster indeed ; for it was a huge lion tltat 
lay on the side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill 
that hung, as it were, a little over him. " Xury," said I, " you 
shall go on shore and kill him." Xury looked frightened, and 
said, '^ Me kill! he eat me at one mouth." I said no more to the 
boy, but bade him lie still ; I then took our biggest gun, which 
was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of 
powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down ; 1 next loaded 
another gun with two bullets ; and the third, — for we had three 
pieces, — I loaded with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I 
could with the first piece, to shoot him in the head ; but he lay so 
with his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg 
about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up growling at 
first, but finding his leg broke, fell down again, and then ^ot up 
upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I neard. 
I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the head ; how- 
ever, I took up the second piece immediatel}', and though he 
began to move ofi*, fired again, and shot him in the head, and had 
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise, but lie 
struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and would have me 
let him go on shore. "Well, go," said I. So the boy jumped 
into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand, swam to shore 
with the other, and coming close to the creature, put the muzzle 
of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the head again, which 
despatched him quite. 

This was game indeed to us, but no food ; and I was very 
sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature 
that was good for nothing to us. 

I bethought myself, however, that perhaps his skin might one 
way or other be of some vulue to us ; and I resolved to take it off^, 
if I could. So Xury and I went to work with him ; but Xury 
was much the better workman, for I knew very ill how to do it. 
Indeed it took us both the whole day ; but at last we got off 
the hide, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effect- 
ually dried it in two days' time, and it afterwards served me to 
lie upon. 

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for 
ten or twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which 
began to abate very much, and going no o^ner to the shore 
than we were obliged to. My design in this was, to make the 
river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any where about the Cape 
de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; 
and if I did not, I knew not what course I had to take, but to 
seek for the Islands, or perish there among the Negroes. I knew 
that all the ships from Europe, which sailed either to the coast 
of Guinea or Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this cape, or 
those islands; and^ in a word, I put the whole oi tq.^ iQT\.\)SL^ 

c2 



18 LIFB AND AOYENTURBS 

upon this single point; either that I most meet with some ship, or 
p«rish. 

When I had pursued this resolution ahout ten days longer, as 
I have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and in 
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon 
the shore to look at us ; we could also t)erceive they were quite 
black, and naked. I was once inclined to have gone on shore to 
them ; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to me, " No 
go, no go." However, I hauled in nearer the shore, that I might 
talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a good 
way. I observed they had no weapons in their hands, except one, 
who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and 
that they would throw them a great way with good aim. So I 
kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as well as I 
could ; and particularly made signs for something to eat : they 
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch me some 
meat ; upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay by, and 
two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour 
carae back, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and 
some com, such as is the produce of their country. But we 
neither knew what the one nor the other was ; however, we were 
willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next difficulty, 
for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and they were as 
much afraid of us ; but they took a safe way for us all, for they 
brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood 
a great way off till we fetched it on board, and then came close 
to us again. 

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make 
them amends ; but an opportunity offered that very instant to 
oblige them wonderfully ; for while we were lying by the shore, 
two mighty creatures came, one pursuing the other with great 
fury from the mountains towards the sea, which greatly terrified 
the people, especially the women. The man that had the lance 
or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did ; however, as the 
two creatures ran directly into the water, they did not seem to 
offer to fall upon any of the negroes, but plunged themselves into 
the sea, and swam about as if they had come for their diversion. 
At last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I 
expected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with 
all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the others. As 
soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him 
directly in the head. Immediately he sunk down into the water, 
but rose again, and plunged up and dovm as if he were struggling 
for life, and so indeed he was ; he immediately made for the shore, 
but between the wound and the choking of the water, he died just 
before he reached the shore. 

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor 
creatures at the noise and fire of my gun ; some of them even 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 19 

fell down as dead with the very terror. But when they saw the 
creature dead, and that I made nigns to them to come to tlio shoroi 
they took heart and came, and besan to soarch for the creature. 
I found him by his blood staining tlio water ; and by the help of 
a rope, which I slung round him. and (ravo the negroes to haul, 
they dragged him on shore, and found tliat it was a mo8t curious 
leopard, suotted to an admirable degree ; and the negrocA held up 
their hanas with admiration to think what it was I had killed him 
with. 

I found quickly the negroes were for eating the HohIi of this 
creature, so I was willing to have them take it as a favour from 
me, which, when I made sijrns to them that thev might do, they 
were very thankful for. Immediately they fell to work ; and 
though they had no knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood 
they took off his skin as readily, and much more readily, than we 
could have done with a knife. They offered me some of the flesh, 
which I declined, making as if I would give it them, but made 
signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought 
me a groat deal more of their provision, which I accepted. Then I 
made signs to them for some water, and held out one of my jars 
to them, turning it bottom upward, to shew that it was empty, 
and that I wanted to have it filled. They called immediately to 
some of their friends, and there came two women, and brought a 
great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppone, in the sun ; 
this they set down for me, as before ; and I sent Xury on shore 
with my jars, and filled them all three. 

I was now furnished with roots and com, such as it was, and 
water; and, leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for 
about eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore, 
till I saw the land run out a great lengUi into the sea, at about 
the distance of four or five leagues before me; and the sea being 
very calm, I ke[)t a large offing to make this point. At length, 
douoling the point, at about two leagues from the land, I saw 
plainly Xeind on the other side to seaward ; then I concluded, as 
It was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verd, and 
those the itilands, called from thence Cape de Vent Islands. How- 
ever, they were at a jzreat distance, and I could not well tell what 
I bad best do, for if I should be taken with a gale of wirid I might 
neither reach one nor the other. 

In this dilemma I stept into the cabin and mit me down, Xury 
having the helm ; when on a sudden the boy cried out, ** Master, 
master, a ship with a sail !" and the foolish boy was fright'ined 
outof bb wits, thinking it must needs be some of his mast^^r's 
ships sent to pursue us, when 1 knew we were gotten far imtmuh 
out of their reach. I jumiM$d out of the cabin, and imm<^liati)iy 
saw not only the ship, but wfiat she was ; viz. that it was a Por- 
tuguese ship, and, as I thought, bound to the coast of Guinea for 
neg^roef. But when I observed the course she steered ^ I ^^6A 



20 LIFE AND ADVBNTURES 

soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did not 
design to come any nearer to the shore ; upon which I stretched 
out to sea as much as I could, resolving to speak with them if 
possible. 

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to 
come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I could 
make any signal to them. However, after I had crowded to tho 
utmost, and began to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help 
of their glass, and that it was some European boat, which, as they 
supposed, must belong to some ship that was lost ; so they short- 
ened sail to let me come up. I was encouraged with this ; and as 
I had my late master's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to 
them for a signal of distress, and fired a gun ; upon which they 
very kindly brought to, and lay-by for me j and in about three 
hours' time I came up with them. 

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, Spanish, and 
French ; but I understood none of them ; but at last a Scotch 
sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered him, and 
told him that I was an Englishman, that had made my escape out 
of slavery from the Moors. Then they bade me come on board, 
and very kindly took me in, and all my goods. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me that I was thus delivered, as 
I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless condi- 
tion, and I immediately offered all I had to the captain of the 
ship, as a return for my deliverance ; but he generously told me 
he would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be de- 
livered safe to me when I came to the Brazils ; " For," says he, 
" I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad 
to be saved myself; and it may one time or other be my lot to be 
taken up in the same condition : besides," said he, " when I carry 
you to the Brazils, so great a way from your own country, if I 
should take from you what you have, you will be starved there, 
and then I only take away that life I nave given. No, no, Sig- 
nior In^lese," says he, "I will carry you thither in charity, and 
those things will help you to buy your subsistence there, and your 
passage home again." 

As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the per- 
formance to a tittle, for he ordered that none of the seamen should 
touch any thing I had ; then he took every thing into his own pos- 
session, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, even so 
much as to my three earthen jars. 

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and 
told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and asked me 
what I would have for it? I told him he had been so generous 
to me in every thing that I could not offer to make any price for the 
boat, but would leave it entirely to him ; upon which he told me he 
would give me a note of hand to pay me 80 pieces of eight for it 
at Brazil ; and when it came there, if any one offered to give 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 21 

more, he would make it up. He offered me also 60 pieces of eight 
more for my boy Xory, which I was loath to take ; not that I waa 
oot willing to let the captain have him, but I was very loath to sell 
the poor boy's liberty who had assisted me so ^tbfolly in pro* 
coring my own. However, when I let him know the reason, he 
owned it to be just, and offered me this medium ; that he would 
give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he 
turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury saying he was willing 
to so to him, I let the captain have him. 

w'e had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived in All- 
Saints Bay in about twenty-two days after. The generous treat- 
ment the captain gave me I can never enough remember. He 
would take nothing of me for my passage, eave me twenty 
ducats for the leopara's skin, and forty for the lion's skin, whida 
I had in my boat, and caused every tmng which I had in the ship 
to be punctually delivered to me, and what I was willing to sell 
he bought ; in a word, I made about 220 pieces of eight of all my 
car^, with which stock I went on shore in the BrazOs. 

Being recommended by the captain to the house of a good 
honest man like himself, wno had an Ingenio, as they call it, that 
is, a plantation and a sugar house, I lived with him some time, 
and acquainted myself by that means with the manner of their 
planting and making of sugar ; and seeing how well the planters 
lived, and how quickly they grew rich, I determined, if I could 
get license to settle there, I would turn planter too, resolving in 
the mean time to find out some way to get over my money which 
I had left in London. To this purpose, getting a kind of a 
letter of naturalisation, I purchased as much land as my money 
would reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and settle- 
ment, such as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to 
myself to receive from England. 

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon, but bom of Eng- 
lish parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circum- 
stances as I was. I call him neighbour, because his plantation lay 
next to mine, and we went on very sociably together. My stock 
was but low as well as his, and we rather planted for food than 
any thing else for about two years. However, we began to in- 
crease, and our land began to come into order ; so that the third 
year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large piece 
of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come ; but we 
both wanted help ; and now I found, more than before, that I 
had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury. 

However, 1 had no remedy but to go on. I had ^ot into an 
employment directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for 
which I forsook my father's house, and broke through all his 
good advice ; and I used often to say to myself, I could have 
done this as well in England among my friends, as have gone five 
thousand miles off to do it^ among strangers and 8aya^<&^ m ^^^- 



22 LIFE AND ADTBNTURBS 

demess, and at snch distance as never to hear from any part of 
the world that had the least knowledge of me. 

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the 
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with 'but now and 
then this neighbour ; no work to be done but by the labour of 
my hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man cast away 
upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself. 
How should all men reflect, that when they compare their present 
condition with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to 
make the exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity hj 
their experience. And how just has it been, that the truly soh- 
tary life I reflected on should be my lot in an island of mere deso- 
lation, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which 
I then led, in which, had I continued, I had^ in all probability, 
been prosperous and happy. 

I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on 
the plantation before ray kind friend, the captain of the Miip, 
went back ; for the ship remained there, in providing loading and 
preparing for the voyage, nearly three months ; when, telling him 
what little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me 
this friendly and sincere advice : " Signor Inglese," says he 
(for so he always called me), "if you will give me letters, with 
orders to the person who has your money to send your effects to 
Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as 
are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce of 
them, God willing, at my return ; but since human affairs are 
all subject to changes and disasters, I would have you give orders 
but for one hundred pounds, which you say is half your stock, 
and let the hazard be run for the flrst, so that if it come safe, 
you may order the rest the same way, and if it miscarry, you 
may still have the other half to have recourse to." 

This advice was so wholesome, and looked so friendly, that I 
could not but be convinced it was the best course I could take ; 
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom 
I had left my money, as he desired. 

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of my 
adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the 
Portuguese captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and 
what condition I was now in, with all other necessary directions 
for my supply ; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he 
found means, by some of the English merchants there, to send 
over, not the order only, but a full account of my story, to a 
merchant at London, who represented it effectually to her, where- 
upon she not only delivered the money, but, out of her own 
pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a very handsome present for 
his humanity and charity to me. 

The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in 
English goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 23 

directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to 
the Brazils ; among which, without my direction (for I was too 
young in my business to think of them), he had taken care to 
have all sorte of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my 
plantation, and which were of great use to me. 

When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune made, and 
was surprised with joy at it ; and my good steward, the captain, 
had laid out the five pounds which mv friend had sent him for a 
present for himself, to purchase and bring me over a servant 
under bond for six years' service, for which he would not accept 
of any consideration, except a little tobacco of my own produce, 
which I desired he would take. 

Neither was this all; but my goods being all of English 
manufactures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and things particularly 
valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell them 
to very great advantage, so that 1 may say I had more than 
four times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely be- 
yond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my plan- 
tation ; for the first thing I did, was to buy me a negro slave, and 
a European servant also, besides that which the captain brought 
me from Lisbon. 

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means 
of our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next 
year with great success in my plantation ; I raised fifty great 
rolls of tobacco on my own ground more than I had disposed of 
for necessaries among my neighbours, and these fifty rolls, being 
each of above an hundred weight, were well cured and laid by 
against the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now, increas- 
ing in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of pro- 
jects and undertakings beyond my reach, such as are, indeed, 
often the ruin of the best heads in business. 

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room 
for all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my 
father so earnestly recommended a quiet retired life, and of 
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to 
be full. But as I had broken away from my parents, so I could 
not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I 
had of being a thriving man in my new plantation, only to pur- 
sue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature 
of the thing admitted, and thus I cast myself down again into 
the deepest gulf of human misery that ever man fell into, or 
perhaps could be consistent with life and a state of health in the 
world. 

To come, then, to the particulars of this part of my story. 
You may suppose that, having now lived almost four years in 
the Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon 
my plantation, I had not only learned the language, but had con- 
tracted acquaintance and friendship among my tcllo^'-\^\^xAj&\^^ 



24 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

as well as among the merchants of St. Salvadore, which was our 
port; and that in my discourses among them, I had frequently 
given them an account of my two voyages to the coast of Guinea, 
the manner of trading with the negroes there, and how easy it 
was to purchase upon the coast for trifles, — such as beads, toys, 
knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like, — not only 
gold-dust, Guiuea grains, elephants' teeth, &c., but negroes for 
the service of the Brazils in great numbers. 

They listened always very attentively to my discourses, and 
especially to that part which related to the buying negroes, which 
was a trade at that time not only not far entered into, but, as far 
as it was, had been carried on by the assientos, or permission of 
the kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed from the public, 
so that few negroes were bought, and those extremely dear. 

It happened that, being in company with some merchants 
and planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very 
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and told 
me they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed 
with them of last night, and they came to make a secret pro- 
posal to me ; and after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that 
they had a mind to lit out a ship to go to Guinea ; that they had 
all plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so 
much as servants ; that as it was a trade that could not be car- 
ried on, because they could not publicly sell the negroes when 
they came home, so they desired to make but one voyage, to 
bring the negroes on shore privately, and divide them among 
their own plantations ; and, in a word, the question was, whether 
I would go as their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading 
part upon the coast of Guinea ; and they offered me that I should 
have my equal share of the negroes without providing any part 
of the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been 
made to any one that had not had a settlement and plantation of 
his own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be 
very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me, 
that was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but 
go on as I had begun for three or four years more, and to have 
sent for the other hundred pounds from England, and who in 
that time, and with that little addition, could scarce have failed of 
being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in- 
creasing too, — for me to think of such a voyage was the most 
preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could be 
guilty of. 

But I could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain my 
first rambling designs when my father's good counsel was lost 
upon me ; in a word, I told them I would go with all my heart, 
if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my 
absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CSVSOB. 25 

miscarried. This they all engaged tado, and entered into writ- 
ings or covenants to do so ; and I made a formal will, disposing 
of my plantation and effects, in case of my death, m^J^ing the 
captain of the ship that had saved my life, as before, my uni- 
versal heir, but obliging him to dispose of my effects as I had 
directed in my will : one-half of the produce being to himselt^ 
and the other to be shipped to England. 

At length, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo fur- 
nished, and all things done as by agreement by my partners in 
the voyage, I went on board on the 1st of September, being the 
same day eight years that I went from my father and mother at 
Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the £;>ol to 
my own interest. 

Our vessel was about 120 tons burthen, carried dx guns, and 
fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself. We had 
on board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit 
for our trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, and 
odd trifles, especially litt& looldng-glassoSy knives, hatchets, and 
the like. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to 
the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over 
for the African coast when the^ came about ten or twelre de- 
grees of northern latitude, which it seems was the manner of 
their course in those days. We had very good weather, only 
excessively hot, all the way apcm oar own coast, till we came to 
the height of Gape St. Au^rostino, from whence, keeping farther 
off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound 
for the isle Femancf de NoronbA, holding our course N,s. by N., 
and leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed the 
line in about twelve days' time, and were, by our last observati'/n, 
in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when 
a violent tornado or hurricane took us quite out of our reckon- 
ing : it began from the south-east, came about to the north- 
west, and then settled into the north-east, from wlienee it blew 
in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we 
eould do nothing but drive ; and scudding away before it, let it 
carry us whither the fury of the winds directed ; and during 
these twelve days I expected every day to be swallowed up, rjor, 
indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives. 

In this distress, besides the terror c€ the %if^rm^ one <j1 our 
men died of the calenture, and one num and tlie b'/y were 
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weatlier abatfiitf 
a little, the master made an observatioD as' well as ^le e^/uld, uwl 
found that he was in about deven decrees north latit^id^, but 
that he was twenty-two degrees of loniptude differeriee west fnmi

the Great River ; and began to consult with me what course he 
should take, for the ship was leaky and very much disabled ; 
and he was for going directly back to the coast of Brazil. 

I was positively against that ; and looking over the charts of 
the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no 
inhabited country for us to have recourse to till we came within 
the circle of the Carribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to 
stand away for Barbadoes, which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid 
the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of Mexico, we might easily 
perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days' sail, whereas we 
could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa with- 
out some assistance both to our sliip and ourselves. 

With this design we changed our course, and steered away 
ir.w. by w., in order to reach some of our English islands, 
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise deter- 
mined ; for being in the latitude of twelve deg. eighteen min., a 
second storm came upon us, which carried us away with the 
same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way 
of all human commerce, that had our lives been saved as to the 
sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than 
ever returning to our own country. 

In this peril, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our 
men, early in the morning, cried out, " land !" and we had no 
sooner run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing 
whereabouts in the world we were, than the ship struck upon a 
sandbank, and in a moment the sea broke over her in such a 
manner that we expected we should all have perished forth- 
with, and we were immediately driven into our close quarters, 
to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea. 

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like con- 
dition to describe or conceive our consternation ; we knew no- 
thing of where we were, or upon what land it was we were 
driven, whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not 
inhabited ; and as the fury of the wind was still great, though 
rather less than at first, we could not so much as hope to have 
the ship hold many minutes without breaking in pieces, unless 
the winds by a kind of miracle should turn immediately about ; 
in a word, we sat looking one upon another, and expecting death 
every moment, and every man acting accordingly as preparing 
for another world, for there was little or nothing more for us to 
do in thb : that which was our present comfort, and all the com- 
fort we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did 
not break yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate. 

Now, though we found that the wind did a little abate, yet 
the ship, having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast 
for us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition 
indeed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as 
well as we could. We had a boat at our stern just before the 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 27 

storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's 
rudder, and in the next place she broke away, and either sunk 
or was driven off to sea ; so there was no hope from her. We had 
another boat on board, but how to get her ofi^ into the sea was a 
doubtful thing ; however, there was no room to debate, for we 
fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some 
told us she was actually broken already. The mate of our vessel 
laid hold of the boat without delay, and with the help of the rest 
of the men, got her slung over the ship's side, and all getting into 
her, we let go, and committed ourselves, eleven in number, to 
God's mercy and the wild sea ; for though the storm was abated 
considerably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upon the shore. 

And now our case was dismal indeed ; mr we all saw plainly 
that the boat could not live in such a sea, and that we should be 
inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if 
we had, could we have done any thing with it; so we worked at 
the oar towards the land, though with heavy hearts, like men 
going to execution, for we all knew that, when the boat came 
nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand pieces by 
the breach of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God 
in the most earnest manner ; and the wind driving us towards 
the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own hands, 
pulling as well as we could towards land. 

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or 
shoal, we knew not ; the only hope was, that we might happen 
to run into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, 
where, by great chance, we might get under the lee of the land, 
and perhaps make smooth water. Nothing, however, of this 
appeared ; but a%we made nearer and nearer the shore, the land 
looked more frightful than the sea. 

Alter we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a 
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came roll- 
ing astern of us, and took us with such i^ry, that it overset the 
boat at once, and separating us, as well from the boat as from 
one another, gave us not time so much as to say, O God ! for 
we were all swallowed up in a moment. 

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt 
when I sank into the water ; for though I swam very well, yet I 
could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath, 
till a wave having driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on 
towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back and left me 
upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the water I took 
in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as breath left, that, 
seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon 
my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as 
I could, before another wave should return and take me up again. 
But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it ; for I saw the seo. 
come after me as high as a great hill, and as forioxiB oia ^xl eiieay^ 



28 LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

which I had no means or strength to contend with ; my business 
was, to hold my breath, and raise myself upon the water if I 
could, and so by swimming to preserve my breathing, and pilot 
myself towards the shore if possible ; my greatest concern now 
being, that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards 
the shore when it came on, might not carry me with it again 
when it gave back towards the sea. 

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty 
or thirty feet deep in its body, and 1 could feel myself carried 
with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great 
way ; but I held my breath, and swam forward still with all my 
might. I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I 
felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my 
head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water, and 
though it was not two seconds of time that I could keep myself so, 
yet it relieved me greatly, and gave me breath and new courage. 
I was covered again with water a good while, but not so long but 
I held it out : and finding the water had spent itself, and began 
to return, I struck forward, and felt ground again with my feet. 
I stood still a few moments to recover breath, and till the water 
went from me, and then took to my heels and ran with what 
strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither would 
this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in 
after me again ; and twice mofe I was lifted up by the waves and 
carried forward as before, the shore being very flat. 

The last time of these two had well nigh been fatal to me ; for 
the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather 
dashed me against a piece of a rock, and that with such force as 
to leave me senseless and indeed helpless as to^y own deliver- 
ance ; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath, as 
it were, quite out of my body ; and had it not returned again im- 
mediately, I must have been choked in the water ; but I recovered 
a little before the return of the sea, and seeing I should be covered 
again with the waves, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the/ock, 
and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. 
Now as the waves were not so high afi(*at first, being near land, I 
held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, 
which brought me so near the shore that the next wave, though it 
went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; 
and the next run I took I got to the mainland, where, to my great 
comfort, I clambered up the shore, and sat me down upon the 
grass^ free from danger, and quite out of the reach of the water.

30 LIFE AKD ADVENTUBES 

coming upon me, I began with a heavy heart to consider what 
would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, 
seeing at night they always come abroad for their prey. 

All the remedy that onered to my thoughts at that time was, 
to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which 
grew near me, and where I resolved to remain all night, and con- 
sider the next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no 
prospect of life. I walked about a fiirlong from the shore to see 
if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great 
joy ; having drank and put a little tobacco in my mouth to pre- 
vent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, endea- 
voured to place myself so as that if I should sleep I might not 
fall ; and having cut me a short stick like a truncheon for my 
defence, I took up my lodging, and being excessively fatigued, 
I soon fell fast asleep. 

When I awoke it was broad day, the weather clear, and the 
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and swell as before ; but 
that which surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in 
the night from the sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, 
and was driven up almost as far as the rock, where I had been so 
bruised by dashing against it. This being within about a mile 
from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright 
still, I wished myself on board, that, at least, I might save some 
necessarj'^ things for my use. 

When I came down from the tree I looked about me again, and 
the first thing I saw was the boat, which lay as the wind and the 
sea had tossed her up upon the land, about two miles on my right 
hand. I walked as far as I could upon the shore to get to it, but 
found a neck or inlet of water between, which was about half a 
mile broad ; so I came back for the present, being more intent 
upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my 
present subsistence. 

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide 
ebbed so far out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of 
the ship. And here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I 
saw evidently that if we had kept on, we should have all got safe 
on shore, and I should not have been so miserable as to be left 
entirely destitute of all comfort and company as I now was. This 
forced tears from my eyes again : but as there was little relief in 
that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the ship ; so I pulled off my 
clothes and took to the water ; but when I came to the ship, my 
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board, for as she 
lay aground, and high out of the water, there was nothing within 
my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second 
time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered I did not 
see at first, hang down by the fore-chains so low that with some 
difficulty I laid hold of it, and by this means got up into the fore- 
castle of the ship. Here I found that the ship was bulged, and 



BOBINBON CRUSOE. 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 31 

had a ^reat deal of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the 
side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay 
lifted up upon the bank, and her head low almost to the water. 
By this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that 
part was dry. All the ship's provisions were untouched by the 
water : and being very hungry, I went to the bread-room and 
filled my pockets with biscuit, and eat it as I went about other 
things, for I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in the 
great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and which I had, indeed, 
need enough of to spirit me for what was before me. Now I 
wanted nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many things 
which I foresaw would be very necessary to me. 

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, 
and this extremity roused my application. We had several spare 
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast 
or two in the ship. I resolved to fall to work with these, and 
flung as many of them overboard as I could manage for their 
weight, tying every one with a rope, that it might not drive away. 
When this was done I went down the ship's side, and pulling 
them to me, I tied four of them fast together at both ends in the 
form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of plank upon 
them crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but that 
it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too 
light; so with the carpentePs saw I cut a spare topmast into 
three lengths and added them to my raft, with a sreat deal of 
labour and pains ; but hope of furnishing myself witu necessaries 
encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to 
have done upon another occasion. 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable 
weight ; my next care was, what to load it with, ana how to pre- 
serve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea. But I was not 
long considering this ; I laid all the planks upon it that I could 
get ; and having considered well what I most wanted, I first got 
three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and emp- 
tied, and lowered them down upon my raft. The first of these I 
filled with provisions, namely, bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, 
^ye pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and 
a little remainder oi European com which had been laid by for 
some fowls which Are brought to sea with us. lliere bad been 
some barley and wheat together, but, to my great disappointment, 
I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As 
for liquors, I found several cases of bottles belonging to our skip- 
per, in which were some cordial waters, and in all about five or 
six gallons of rack. These I stowed by themselves, there being 
no need to put them into the chest, nor any room for them. 
While I was doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though 
very calm ; and I had the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and 
waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim. qjw^^» 



32 LIFE AND ADVENTUBE8 

This put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found 
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I 
had other things which my eye was more upon. First, there 
were tools to work with on shore ; and it was after long searching 
that I found out the carpenter's chest, which was inaeed a very 
useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-loading 
of gold would have been at that time. I got it down to my raft, 
whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for 1 knew in 
general what it contained. 

My next care was for some ammimition and arms : there were 
two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols ; 
these I secured first, with some powder-horns and a small bag of 
shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels 
of powder in the ship, and with much search I found them. Two 
were dry and good, the third had taken water. Those two I got 
to my raft with the arms ; and now I thought myself well 
freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with 
them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder, and the least capful of 
wind would have overset all my navigation. 

I had three encouragements : first, a smooth, calm sea ; second, 
the tide rising and setting into the shore ; third, what little wind 
there was blew me towards the land. And thus, having found 
two or three broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the 
tools which were in the chest, two saws, an axe, and a hammer, 
with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile or thereabouts my raft 
went very well, only that I found it drive a little distant from the 
place where I had landed before, by which I perceived that there 
was some current of the water, and consequently I hoped to find 
some creek or river there which I might make use of as a port to 
get to land. 

As I imagined, so it was ; there appeared before me a little 
opening of the land, and I found a strong tide set into it, so I 
guided my raft as well as I could to keep in the middle of the 
stream ; but here I had like to have sufiered a second shipwreck, 
for knowing nothing of the coast, one end of my raft run aground 
upon a shoal, and it wanted but a little that all my cargo had 
slipped ofi" towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the 
water. I did my utmost by setting my back against the chests 
to keep them in their places, but could not thriist off the raft with 
all my strength, neither durst I stir from the posture I was in ; 
but holding up the chests with all my might, stood in that manner 
nearly half an hour, in which time the rising of the water brought 
me a little more upon a level ; and a little after, the water still 
rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her off with the oar I 
had into the channel ; and then driving up higher, I at length 
found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both 
sides and a strong current running up. I looked on both sides 
for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 33 

driyen too high up the river, hoping in time to see some ship at 
sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near the coast as 
I could. 

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, 
to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and 
at last got so near that, reaching ground with my oar, I could 
thrust her directly in ; hut here I had like to have dipped all my 
cargo in the sea again, for the shore lying pretty deep, that is to 
say sloping, there was no place to land but where one end of the 
float, if it run on shore, would lie so high, and the other sink 
lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All that 
I could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the 
raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the side of it fast to the 
shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water 
would flow over ; and so it did. As soon as I found water enough 
(for my raft drew about a foot of water), I thrust her upon that 
flat piece of ground, and there fastened or moored her by sticking 
my two broken oars into the ground, one on one side near one 
end, and one on the other side near the other end ; and thus I lay 
till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my cargo sale 
on shore. 

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper 
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods to secure 
them from whatever might happen. Where I was 1 yet knew not ; 
whether on the continent or an island, whether inhabited or not 
inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts or not. There was a 
hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep and high, 
and which seemed to overtop some other hills which lay as in a 
ridge from it northward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces 
and one of the pistols, and a horn of powder ; and thus armed, I 
travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill, where, to my 
great afiiiction, I saw my fate, namely, that I was in an island en- 
-vironed every way with the sea, no land to be seen except some 
rocks which lay a great way ofl*, and two small islands less than 
this which lay about three leagues to the west. 

I found fidso that the island I was in was barren, and, as I 
saw good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of 
whom, however, I saw none ; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but 
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them could I tell what 
was flt for food and what not. At my coming back I shot at 
a great bird which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of a great 
wood ; I believe it was the flrst gun that had been fired there since 
the creation of the world. I had no sooner fired but from all parts 
of the wood there arose an innumerable number of fowls of many 
sorts, making a confused screaming and crying, every one accord- 
ing to his usual note ; but not one of them of any kind that I 
knew. As for the creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of 
hawk, its colour and beak resembling it, but it had no taioTN^ ^t 



34 LIP£ AND ADVENTUBBS 

claws more than common: its flesh was carrion, and good for 
nothing. 

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and 
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the 
rest of that day ; and what to do with myself at night I knew 
not, nor indeed where to rest, for I was afraid to lie down on the 
ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me, — 
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those 
fears. 

However, as well as I could, I barricaded myself round with 
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a 
kind of a hut for that night's lodging ; as for food, I saw no 
way as yet to supply myself, except that I had seen two or 
three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the 
fowl. 

I now began to consider that I might still get a great many 
things out of the ship which would be useful to me, and parti- 
cularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things as 
might come to land, and I resolved to make another voyage on 
board the vessel if possible ; and as I knew that the first storm 
that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to 
do nothing till I had got every thing out of the ship that I could. 
Then I considered whether I should take back the raft, but this 
appeared impracticable ; so I resolved to go as before, when the 
tide was down; and I did so, only that I stripped before I went 
from my hut, having nothing on but a chequered shirt and a pair 
of linen trousers. 

I got on board the ship as before, and prepared a second raft ; 
and having had experience of the first, I neither made this so 
unwieldy, nor loaded it so much, but yet I brought away several 
things very useful to me. In the carpenter's stores I found two 
or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen 
or two of hatchets, and, above all, that most useful thing called a 
grindstone ; all these I secured, together with several things be- 
longing to the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and 
two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another fowl- 
ing-piece, with some small quantity of powder, and a large bag 
full of small shot. 

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could 
find, and a spare fore- topsail, hammock, and some bedding ; and 
with this I loaded my raft, and brought them all safe on shore, to 
my very great comfort. 

Having thus got my second cargo on shore, though I was in- 
clined to open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, 
(for they were too heavy, being large casks,) I went to work to 
make me a little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for 
that purpose ; and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew 
would spoil either with rain or sun, and piled all the empty chests 



CH. II. OF &0BIN80N CRU)!OE. 35 

and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from any sud- 
den attempt either from man or beast. 

When I had done this, I blocked up the door of the tent with 
some boards within, and an empty chest set up on end without; 
and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two 
pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to 
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for I was 
very weary and heavy. 

I had the largest magazine of all kinds now that ever were laid 
up, I believe, for one man ; but I was not yet satisfied ; for while 
the ship sat upright in that posture, I thought I ouglit to get 
every thing out of her that I could ; so every day at low water I 
went on board, and brought away something or other ; but ])ar- 
ticularly the third time I went, I brought away as much of the 
rig^ng as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope twjne I 
could get, with a piece of spare canvass, which was to mend the 
sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder ; in a word, 
I brought away all the sails first and last, only that I was fain to 
cut them in pieces, and bring as much at a time as I could, for they 
were no more useful as sails, but only as mere canvass. 

But that which comforted me more still was, that, last of all, 
after I had made Hve or six such voyages as these, and thought I 
had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my med- 
dling with, I found a great hogshead of bread, and three large 
runlets of rum or spirits, and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine 
flour; which was surprising to me, as I had given over expecting 
any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I 
soon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and wrapped it up, par* 
eel by parcel, in pieces of the sails, which I cut out : in a word, I 
got all this safe on shore also. 

The next day I made another voyage; and now, having 
-emptied the ship of all that was portable, I began with the 
cables; and cuttmg them into pieces, such as I could move, I 
got two cables and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I 
could find; and having cut down the mizen-yard, and every 
thing I could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all those 
heavy goods, and came away. But here my good luck began to 
leave me; for this raft was so unwieldy and so overladen, that 
after I had entered the little cove where I had landed the rest of 
my goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, 
it overset, and threw me and all my cargo into the water. For 
myself it- was no great matter, for I was near the shore ; but as to 
my cargo, it was great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I 
expected would have been of great use to me; however, when the 
tide was out, I got most of the pieces of cable ash.ore, and even 
some of the iron, though with infinite labour ; for I was obliged to 
dip for it into the water, a work which fatigued me very much. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, in which time I had 



S6 LIFB AND ADVENTUBES 

carried away from the ship all that one pair of hands could well 
be supposea capable to bring ; though I believe verily, had the 
calm weather continued, I should have brought away the whole 
ship, piece hj piece. On preparing to go on board once more, I 
found the wind begin to rise ; however, at low water I went on 
board, and though 1 thought I had rummaged the cabin so effec- 
tually as that nothing more could be found, yet I discovered a 
locker with drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three 
razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some ten or a. dozen of 
good knives and forks ; and in another, about thirty-six pounds 
value in money, some European coin, some Brazil, some pieces 
of eight, some gold, some silver. 

I smiled to myself at the sight of this. ''O drug," said I 
alond, ''what art thou good for? thou art not worth to me as 
much as the taking off the ground ; one of these knives is worth 
all this heap : I have no manner of use for thee, even remain 
where thou art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life is 
not worth saving." However, upon second thoughts, I took it 
away, and wrapping all in a piece of canvass, I began to think of 
making another rau ; but while I was preparing it, I found the 
sky began to over-cast, and the wind to rise ; and in a quarter of 
an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It presently occurred 
to me that it was in vain for me to try to make a ran with the 
wind off shore, and that I had better be gone before the tide of 
flood began, as otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore 
at all ; accordingly, I let myself down into the water, and swam 
across the channel which lay between the ship and the sands, 
and even that with difficulty enough, partly on account of the 
weight of things I had about me, and partly from the roughness 
of the water ; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it was 
quite high water it blew a storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with all 
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that 
night : and in the morning, when I looked out, no ship was to 
be seen ; I was a little surprised, but recovered myself with this 
satisfactory reflection, viz. that I had lost no time, nor abated any 
diligence to get every thin^ out of her that could be usefiil to me, 
and that indeed there was little left in her that I was able to bring 
away if I had liad more time. 

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing my- 
self against savages, if any should appear, or wild beasts, if any 
were in the island ; and I had many thoughts as to the best methods 
of doing ihiSf and what kind of dwelling to make ; whether I should 
make a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the earth ; and in short, 
I resolved uppn both, of the description of which it may not be 
amiss to give an account. 

I soon found the place I was in was not suited for my abode, 
because it was upon a low moorish ground, near the sea ; and I 



CH. II* OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 37 

believed would not be wholesome, and more especially because 
there was no fresh water near it ; so I resolved to find a more 
healthy and convenient spot of ground. 

I considered several tnings which would be proper for me in 
my situation : Ist, health and fresh water, which I just now men- 
tioned ; 2dly, shelter from the heat of the sun ; 3dly, security 
from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast ; 4thly, a view 
to the sea, — that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not lose 
any advantage lor my deliverance, of which I was not willing to 
banish all expectation yet. 

In search of a proper place, I found a little plain on the side 
of a rising hill, whose front was steep as a house-side, so that 
nothing could come down upon me from the top ; on the side of 
this rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the 
entrance or door of a cave, though there was not really any cave 
or way into the rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I re- 
solved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above un hundred 
yards broad, and about twice as long, and at the end of it de- 
scended irregularly every way down into the low grounds by the 
sea-side. It was on the n.n.w. side of the hill, so that 1 was 
sheltered from the heat every day till it came to a w. and by s. 
sun, or thereabouts ; which in those countries is near the setting. 

Befiore I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the hollow 
place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from 
the rook, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning 
and ending. 

In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving 
them into the ffround till they stood very firm, like piles, the 
biggest end being out of the ground about Ave foot and a half, 
and sharpened on the top ; the two rows did not stand above six 
inches from one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship, 
and laid them in rows one upon another, within the circle between 
these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in the 
inside, leaning against them, about two feet and a half high, like 
a spur to a post. This fence was so strong, that neither man or 
beast could get into it or over it ; but it cost me a great deal of 
time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring 
them to the place, and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but 
by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, when I was 
in, I lifted over after me ; and so I was completely Heiaeed in and 
fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and cons^equently slept 
secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done ; 
though, as it appeared afterward, there was no need of all this 
caution. 

Into this fortress, with infinite toil, I carried all my rlcko^^^^^ 

B 



38 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

my provisions, ammunition, and stores ; and I constructed a large 
tent, which, to preserve me from the rains, I made double, viz. 
one smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it, and covered 
the uppermost with a large tarpaulin which I had saved among 
the sails. 

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing 
that would spoil by the wet ; and having thus enclosed all my 
goods, I closed up the entrance, which till now I had left open, 
and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock ; 
and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down, out through 
my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the nature of a ter- 
race, so that it raised the ground within about a foot and a balf ; 
and thus I made a cave just behind my tent, which served me like 
a cellar to my bouse. 

It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these 
things were brought to perfection ; and therefore I must go back 
to some other things which took up some of my thoughts. At 
the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for the set- 
ting up my tent and making the cave, that a storm of rain falling 
from a thick dark cloud, there was a sudden flash of lightning, and 
after that a great clap of thunder. I was not so much surprised 
with the lightning as I was with a thought which darted into my 
mind as swift as the lightning itself. Oh, my powder ! my very 
heart sunk within me when I thought that at one blast all my 
powder might be destroyed, on which, not my defence onl)*^, but 
the providing of my food, as I supposed, entirely depended : I was 
not nearly so anxious about my own danger, though, had the 
powder taken fire, I had never known who had hurt me. 

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm 
was over, I laid aside all my works, my building and fortifying, 
and applied myself to make bags and boxes to separate the pow- 
der, and to keep it in small parcels, in hope that, whatever might 
come, it might not take fire at once ; and to keep it so apart that 
it should not be possible to make one part set fire to another. I 
finished this work in about a fortnight ; and I think my powder, 
which in all was about 240 pounds weight, was divided in not less 
than a hundred parcels ; as to the barrel that had been wet, I did 
iiot apprehend any danger from that, so I placed it in my new 
cave, which I called mv kitchen ; and the rest I hid up and down 
in holes among the rocks, so that no wet might come to it ; mark- 
ing very carefully where I laid it. 

In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once 
at least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself as to see 
if I could kill any thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to 
acquaint myself with what the island produced. The first time I 
went out, I quickly discovered that there were goats in theisland, 
which was a great satisfaction to me ; but then it was attended 



CH. II. OF BOBINSON CRUSOB* Z9 

with this misfortune, viz. that they were so shy, so cunning, and so 
swiit of foot, that it was the most difficult thing in the worJd to 
come at them ; but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but 
that I might now and then shoot one. And so it soon happened ; for 
after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for 
them : I observed, that if they saw me in the valleys, though they 
were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright ; 
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the rocks, 
thev took no notice of me : from whence I concluded, that by the 
position of their eyes, their sight was so directed downward, that 
they did not readily see objects that were above them ; so I always 
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had frequently 
a fair mark. The first shot I made I killed a she-goat, whicn 
had a little kid by her, which she gave suck to, which grieved nie 
heartily; but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her 
till I came and took her up ; and not only so, but when I carried 
the old one with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite 
to my enclosure, upon which I laid down the dam, and took the 
kid in my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred 
it up tame. It would not eat, however ; so I was forced to kill it, 
and eat it myself: these two supplied me with flesh a ^reat while, 
for I eat sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread especially) 
as much as I possibly could. 

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely neces- 
sary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to bum ; and 
what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what 
conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its place ; 
but I must firrt give some little account of myself, and of my 
thoughts aboat living, which it may well be supposed were not 
few. 

I had a dismal prospect of my condition ; for as I was not cast 
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a vio-* 
lent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage, and a 
great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues, out of the ordinary course 
of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to consider it as a 
determination of Heaven, that in this desolate place, and in this 
desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears would run plenti- 
fully down my face when I made these reflections, and sometimes 
I would expostulate with myself why God should thus completely 
ruin His creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so 
without help abandoned, so entirely depressed, that it could hardly 
be rational to be thankful for such an existence. 

But something always returned swiftly upon me to check theso 
thoughts, and to reprove me ; and particularly one day, walking 
with my gun in my hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive 
upon the subject of my present condition, when reason, as it were, 
expostulated with me the other way, thus : " Well, you are in a 
desolate condition, it is true ; but pray remembei) vvl\!(bT^ ^x^ \}cl<^ 



40 UFX AND ADTKirrURBS 

rest of you ? Were there not eleven of you in the boat ? Where 
are the ten ? Why were they not saved and you lost? Why were 
you singled out ? Is it better to be here or there V and then I 
looked towards the sea. All evils are to be considered with the 
good that is in them, and with what worse attends them. 

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for 
my subsistence, and what would have been my case if it had not 
happened that the ship floated from the place where she first 
struck, and was driven so near the shore that I had time to eet 
all these things out of her. What would have been my ease if I 
had been to have lived in the condition in which I at first came 
on shore, without necessaries of life or necessaries to supply and 

Erocure them ? "Particularly," said I to myself, "what should I 
ave done without a gun, without ammunition, without any tools 
to make any thing, or to work with ; without clothes, bedding, 
tent, or any manner of covering?" And that now 1 had all these 
in a sufficient quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in 
such a manner, as to live without my gun when my ammunition 
was spent ; so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without 
any want, as long as I lived ; for I considered from the beginning 
how I should provide for the accidents that might happen, and for 
the time that was to come, even not only after my ammunition 
should be spent, but even after my health or strength should 
decay. 

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition 
being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being blown up 
by lightning ; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising to 
me when it lightened and thundered, as I before observed. 

And now being about to enter into a relation of a course of 
solitary life, such as perhaps was never heard of in the world 
before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it in its 
order. It was, by my account, the 30th of September, on which 
I first set foot upon this island, when the sun, being, to us, in its 
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head; for I reckoned 
myself, by observations, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees and 
22 minutes north of the line. 

After I had been here about ten or twelve days, it came into 
my thoughts, that I should lose my reckoning of time for want of 
books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sundays from 
the working-days : but to prevent this, I cut it with my knife 
upon a large post in capital letters ; and making it into a great 
cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed, viz. / came on 
thore here on the ^Oth of September , 1669. Upon the sides of this 
square post I cut every day a notch, and every seventh notch was 
as long again as the rest, and every first day of the month as 
long again as that long one : and thus I kept my calendar, or 
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time. 

In the next place I must observe, that among the many things 



CH. II. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 4L 

which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages which I 
made to it, 1 got several things of less valuer but not all less use- 
ful to me, which I omitted setting down before ; as peqs, ink, and 
paj)er, compasses, mathematical instruments, dials, perspectives, 
charts, and books of navigation ; also, I found three very good 
Bibles which came to me in my cargo from England, and which 
I had packed up among my things; some Portuguese books also, 
and among them two or three books of devotion, and several 
other works, all which I carefully secured. And I must not for- 

fet, that we had in the ship a dog and two cats, of whose history 
may have occasion to say something in its place ; for I carried 
both the cats with me ; and as for the dog, he jumped out of tho: 
ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I landed 
with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years ; 
I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that 
he could make up to me ; the only thing wanting was, that he 
should be able to talk to me. The pens, ink, and paper, I hus- 
banded to the utmost ; and I shall shew, that while my ink lasted, 
I kept a very exact account of things ; but after that was gone^ 
I could not ; neither could I make any ink, by any means that I 
could devise. 

And this reminded me that I wanted many things, notwith- 
standing all I had amassed ; and of these, this of the ink was one^ 
as also spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig and remove the earth ;, 
needles, pins, and thread ; as for linen, I soon learned to dispense 
with that without much difficulty. 

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the cir- 
cumstances I was reduced to, and I drew up the state of my affairs 
in writing ; not so much to leave them to any that were to come 
after me, as to prevent my thoughts from daily poring upon them, 
and afflicting my mind ; and as my reason began now to master 
my despondency, I began to comfort myself as well as I could, 
and to set the good against the evil, that I might have something 
to distinguish my case from worse ; and I stated very impartially, 
like debtor and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the mis^ 
eries I sufiered, thus :

that I have got out so many things 
as will either supply my wants or 
enable me to supply myself as long 
as I live. 

Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition, 
and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship, I 
began to apply myself to arrange my way of living, and to make 
things as easy to me as I could. 

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent 
under a side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and 
cables ; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind 
of wall up against it of turf, about two feet thick on the outside ; 
and after some time — I think it was a year and a half — I raised 
rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it 
with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get to keep out 
the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent. 

I have already observed how I brought all my stores into this 
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me. At first 
this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order, 
took up all my place, so that I had no room to turn myself. I set 
myself, therefore, to enlarge my cave, and work farther into the 
earth ; for it was a loose sandy rock, which yielded easily to the 
labour I bestowed on it : and so when I found I was pretty safe 
as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand into the 
rock ; and then turning to the right again, worked quite out, and 
made a door to come out, on the outside of my pale or fortifica- 
tion. 

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were a back- 
way to my tent and to my store-house, but also room to stow my 
goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make sucb necessary 
things as I found 1 most wanted, as particularly a chair and a 
table ; for without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts 
I had ; I could not write or eat, or do several things with so much 
pleasure without a table. 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CftUSOE. 43 

So I went to work ; I had never handled a tool in my life, but 
yet in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, I found that 
I wanted nothing that I could not have made, if I had had tools. 
However, I made abundance of thin^, even without tools, and 
some with no more than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps 
were never made that way before, or so laboriously : for example, 
if I wanted a board, I haa no other way but to cut down a tree, 
set it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my 
axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then make it 
smooth with my adze. It is true, by this method I could make 
but one board out of a whole tree ; but this I had no remedy for 
but patience, any more than I had for the time and trouble which 
it took me to make it ; but my time or labour was little worth, and 
so it was as well employed one way as another. 

However, I made me a table and a chair, in the first place, 
and this I did out of the short pieces of board which I brought on 
my raft from the ship ; but when I had wrought out some board h, 
as above, I made large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half,< 
one over another, all along one side of my cave, to lay my tools, 
nails, and iron- work on ; and, in a word, to arrange every thing, 
that I might come easily at what I wanted ; also I knocked pieceiS 
into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all things that 
would hang up. So that my cave looked like a general magazine 
of all necessary things ; and I had every thing so ready at my 
hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all my ^oods 
in such order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so 
great. 

And now, havin? settled my household-stuff and habitation, 
made me a table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I 
could, I began to keep a journal of every day's employment, of 
which I shall here give you the copy as long as it lasted ; for 
having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off after a time. 

THE JOURNAL. 

September 30, 1659. — I, poor Robinson Crusoe, being ship- 
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, came on shore on this solitary 
island, which I called the Island of Despair, all the rest of the 
ship's company being drowned. 

All the rest of mat day I spent in afflicting myself, at the 
dismal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither food, 
house, clothes, weapon, or place to fly to, and in despair of any 
relief, saw nothing but death before me, either that 1 should be 
devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to 
death for want of food. At the approach of night I slept in a 
tree, for fear of wild creatures; but slept soundly, though it rained 
all night. 

October 1. — In the morning I saw, to my great surprise, that 
the ship had floated with the mgh tide^ and was dme^xi q\i ^cstc^ 



44 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

again much nearer the island ; which as it was some comfort on one 
hand, for seeing her upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if 
the wind abated, I might get on board, and get some food or neces- 
saries out of her for my relief ; so, on the other hand, it renewed 
my grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined, if we had 
all stayed on board might have saved the ship, or at least that they 
would not have been all drowned, as they were ; and that, had 
the men been saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat out of 
the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some other part of the 
world. I spent great part of this day in perplexing myself on 
these things ; but at length, seeing the ship almost dry, I went 
upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam on board ; this 
day also it continued raining, though with no wind at all. 

From October Ist to 24^A. — All these days entirely spent in 
making several voyages to get all I could out of the ship, which 
I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much rain 
also in these days, though with some intervals of fair weather ; 
but, it seems, this was the rainy season. 

Oct, 20. — I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got 
upon it ; but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly 
heavy, I recovered many of them when the tide was out. 

Oct, 25. — It rained all night and all day, with some gusts 
of wind, during which time the ship broke m pieces, the wind 
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen, 
except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent 
this day in covering and securing the goods which I had saved, 
that the rain might not spoil them. 

Oct, 26. — I walked about the shore almost all day, to find 
out a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure my- 
self from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men. 
Towards eight I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and 
marked out a semi- circle for my encampment, which I resolved 
to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification made of double 
piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf. 

[N.B. — My proceedings, up to the time of finishing ray habi- 
tation, being described before, I purposely omit what was said in 
the Journal ; it is sufficient to observe, that I was no less time 
than from the 3d of January to the 14th of April, working, tin* 
ishing, and perfecting my wall, though it was no more than about 
24 yards in length, being a half circle from one place in the rock 
to another place about eight yards from it; the door of the cave 
being in the centre behind it.] 

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game 
every day,Svhen the rain permitted me, and made frequent dis- 
coveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage. 
Particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons ; who built not as 
wood-pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house-pigeons, in the holes 
of the rocks ; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured tQ 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 45 

breed them up tame, and did so ; but when they grew older they 
flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, 
for I had nothing to give them ; however, I frequently found their 
nests, and got their young ones, which were very good meat. 

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found my- 
self wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was im- 
possible for me to make, as indeed, as to some of them, it was ; 
for instance, I could nerer make a cask to be hooped. I had a 
small runlet or two, as I observed before ; but I could never arrive 
to the capacity of making one by them, though I spent many 
weeks abuut it : I could neither put in the heads, or joint the 
staves so true to one another as to make them hold water ; so I 
gave that also over. 

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle ; so that as 
soon as ever it was dark, which was generally by seven o'clock, 
I was obliged to go to bed. I remembered the lump of bees- wax 
with which I made candles in my African adventure, but I had 
none of that now ; the only remedy I had was, that when I had 
killed a goat, I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of 
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some 
oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me light, though not 
a clear, steady light, like a candle. 

In the middle of all my labours it happened that, rummaging 
among my things, I found a little bag, which had been filled with 
com tor the feeding of poultry. What little remainder of corn 
had been in the bag, was all devoured by the rats, and I saw 
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to 
have the bag for some other use (I think it was to put powder 
in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning), I shook the husks 
of com out of it on one side of my fortification under the rock. 

It was a little before the great rains just now mentioned that 
I threw this stufif away, taking no notice of any thing, and not 
so much as remembering that I had thrown any thing there, 
when about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some few stalks 
of something green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied 
might be some plant I had not seen ; but I was surprised and 
greatly astonished when, after a little longer time, I saw about 
ten or twelve ears come out, which were perfect green barley, of 
the same kind as our English barley. 

It is impossible to express my astonishment on this occasion. 
I had hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all ; indeed, 
I had very few notions of religion in my head, or had enter- 
tained any sense of any thing that had befallen me otherwise 
than as a chance, or, as we lightly say, what pleases God, with- 
out so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in these 
things, or His order in governing events in the world ; but after 
I saw barley grow there, in a climate which I knew was not 
proper for corn^ and especially as I knew not how it cam& iWc^^ 



46 LIFE AND ADYBNTUBEB 

it startled me strangely, and I began to think that God had 
miraculously caused this grain to grow without any help of seed 
sown, and that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on 
that wild place. ' 

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my 
eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature* 
should happen upon my account ; and this was the more strange 
to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the 
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of 
rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa 
when I was ashore there. 

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence 
for my support, but, not doubting but that there was more in the 
place, I went all over that part of the island where I had been 
before, peeping in every corner, and under every rock, to see for 
more of it, but I could not find any ; at last it occurred to me 
that I had shaken a bag of chickens' meat out in that place, and 
then the wonder began to cease, and, I must confess, my reli- 
gious thankfulness to God's providence began to abate too, upon 
discovering that all this was nothing but what was common. I 
ought, however, to have been as thankful for so strange and 
unforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous ; for it was- 
really the work of Providence as regarded me, to order or ap- 
point ten or twelve grains of corn to remain unspoiled when the 
rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped from 
heaven ; as also, that I should throw it in that particular place, 
where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it sprang up imme- 
diately ; whereas, if I had thrown it any where else at that time, 
it had been burnt up and destroyed. 

I carefully saved the ears of this corn in their season, whicb 
was about the end of June ; and laying up every one, I resolved 
to sow them all again, hoping in time to have sufficient to supply 
me with bread ; but it was not till the fourth year that I could 
allow myself the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but 
sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its order ; for I lost all that 
I sowed the first season by not observing the proper time, having 
sowed it just before the dry season, so that it never came up at 
all, at least not as it should have done. 

Besides this barley, there were, as above mentioned, twenty 
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care, 
and whose use was of the same kind, or to the same purpose, viz. 
to make me bread, or rather food ; for I found ways to cook it up 
without baking, though I did that also after some time. But to 
return to my journal. 

I worked excessively hard these three or four months to get 
my wall done, and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to 
go into it, not by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that 
there might be no sign in the outside of my habitation. 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 47 

April 16. — I finished the ladder, so I went up with it to the 
top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on the inside. 
This was a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room 
enough ; and nothing could come at me from without, unless it 
could first mount my wall. 

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost 
had all my lahour overthrown at once, and myself killed. As I 
was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the entrance 
into my cave, on a sudden I found the earth come crumbling down 
from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill, over my 
head, and two of the posts 1 had set up in the cave were crack- 
ing in a irightful manner. I was heartily scared, but thought 
nothiug of what was really the cause, only thinking that the top 
of my cave was ^Edling in, as some of it had done before, and for 
fear I should be buried in it, I ran forward to my ladder, and 
not thinking myself safe there either, I got over my wall, for 
fear of the pieces of the hill which I expected might roll down 
upon me. I had no sooner stepped down upon the firm ground 
than 1 plainly saw it was a terrible earthquake, for the ground I 
stood on shook three times at about eight minutes' distance, with 
such shocks as would have overturned the strongest building; 
and a great piece of the top of a rock which stood about halt a 
mile from me, next the sea, fell down with such a terrible noise 
as I never heard in all my life : I perceived also that the very 
sea was put into violent motion b^ it. 

I was so amazed with the thmg itself, having never felt the 
like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one 
dead or stupified ; and the motion of the earth made my 
stomach sick, like one that was tossed at sea. But the noise of 
the falling of the rock awaked me, as it were, and, rousing me 
from the stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror ; and 
I thought of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent and 
all my household good:^, and burying all at once : and this sunk 
my very soul nithin me. 

While I sat thus, I found the air overcast and grow cloudy, 
as if it would rain ; soon after that the wind rose by degrees, so 
that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful hurricane. 
The sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam and froth, the 
shore was deluged with the waves, the trees were torn up by the 
roots, and a terrible storm it was ; and this continued about three 
hours, when it began to abate, and in two hours more it was 
quite calm, and began to rain very hard. 

This violent rain forced me to a new work ; viz. to cut a hole 
through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go 
out, which would else have drowned my cave. After 1 had been 
in my cave some time, and found no more shocks of the earth- 
quake follow, I bcgim to be more composed ; and now, to sup- 
port my spirits^ I went to my little store and took a sm&lV y^t- 



48 I/IFB AND ADVENTURES 

tion of rum, which, however, I did then, and always, very 
sparingly, knowin? I could have no mure when that was gone. 

It continued raining all that night and great part of the next 
day, so that I could not stir abroad ; but mv mind being more 
composed, I began to think of what I had best do, concluding 
that, if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would 
be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building 
some little hut in an open place, which I might surround with a 
wall as I had done here, and so make myself secure from wild 
beasts or men ; concluding, if I stayed where I was, I should cer- 
tainly, one time or other, be buried alive. 

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the 
spot where it stood, which was just under the hianging precipice 
of the hill ; and I spent the next two days, being the 19th and 
20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habi- 
tation. 

The fear of being swallowed up alive made me that I never 
slept in quiet, and yet the apprehension of Ij^ing abroad, without 
any fence, was almost equal to it ; but still, when I looked about, 
and saw how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly con- 
cealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loath to 
remove. 

In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would require a 
vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented 
to run the risk where I was till I had formed a camp for myself, 
and had secured it so as to remove it ; so with this resolution 
I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I would go to 
work with all speed to build a wall with piles and cables, &c., in 
a circle as before, and set my tent up in it when it was finished, 
but that I would venture to stay where I was till it was finished 
and fit to remove to. 

April 22. — The next morning I began to consider of means to 
put this resolve in execution, but I was at a great loss about my 
tools ; I had three large axes, and abundance of hatchets (for we 
carried the hatchets for trafhc with the Indians), but with much 
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of 
notches, and dull ; and though I had a grindstone, I could not 
turn it and grind my tools too ; this cost me as much thouj^ht as 
a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics, 
or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I con- 
trived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might 
have both my hands at liberty. Note. — I had never seen any 
such thing in £ngland, or at least not to take notice how it was 
done, though I have since observed that it is very common 
there. I should also say that my grindstone was very large and 
heavy. This machine cost me a ifull week's work to bring it to 
perfection. 

April 30. — Having perceived that my bread had been low a 



CH. II. OF BOBINSON CRUSOB. 49 

freat while, I now took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one 
iscuit-cake a day, which made ray heart very heavy. 

May 1. — In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the 
tide being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than 
ordinary, which looked like a ca&. When I came to it, I found 
a small barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, 
which were driven on shore by the late hurricane ; and looking" 
towards the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of 
the water than it used to do. I examined the barrel which was 
driven on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, 
but it had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a 
stone ; however, I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and 
went on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck of the 
ship, to look for more. 

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely re- 
moved : the fore-castle, which lay before buried in sand, was 
heaved up at least six feet ; and the stem, which was broken to 

fieces, and parted from the rest by the force of the sea soon after 
had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, up, and cast 
on one side, and the sand was thrown so high on that side next 
her stern, diat, whereas there was a great place of water before, 
so that I could not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck 
without swimming, I could now walk quite up to her when the 
tide was out. I was surprised with this at first, but soon con- 
cluded it must be done by the earthquake; and as by this 
violence the ship was more broken open than formerly, so many 
things came daily on shore which the sea had loosened, and 
which the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land. 

This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of remov- 
ing my habitation ; and I busied myself mightily, that day espe- 
cially, in searching whether I could make any way into the ship ; 
but I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that all 
the inside of the vessel was choked up with sand ; however, as 
I had learned not to despair of any thing, 1 resolved to pull 
every thing to pieces that 1 could of the ship, concluding that 
every thing I could get from her would be of some use or other 
to me. 

May 3. — I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam 
through which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter- 
deck together ; and when I had cut it through, I cleared away 
the sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest, but 
the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time. 

May 4. — I went a-fishing, but caught not one fish that I 
durst eat of, till I was weary of my sport, when, just going to 
leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line 
of some rope-yarn, but I had no hooks ; yet I frequently caught 
fish enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the 
sun^ and eat them dry. 

p 



50 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

May 6. — Worked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder, 
and brought three great fir planks ofi^ from the decks, which I 
tied together, and made swim on shore when the tide or flood 
came on. 

May 6. — Worked on the wreck, jgfot several iron-bolts out of 
her, and other pieces of iron-work : w orked very hard, and came 
home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over. 

May 7. — Went to the wreck, and carried an iron-crow to 
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or 
sand : I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore 
also with the tide. 1 left the iron-crow in the wreck for next day. 
May 16. — It had blown hard in the night, and the wreck 
appeared more broken by the force of the water ; .but 1 stayed so 
long in the woods to ffet pigeons for food, that the tide prevented 
me going to the wrecK that day. 

May 17. — I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore at 
a great distance, near two miles off me, but resolved to see what 
they were, and found they were portions of the head, but too 
heavy for me to bring away. 

May 24. — Every day to this day I worked on the wreck, and 
with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the crow, 
that the first blowing tide several casks floated out, and two of 
the seamen's chests ; but the wind blowing from the shore, no- 
thing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead 
which had some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water and sand 
had spoiled it. 

I continued this work every day to the 15th of June, except 
the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during 
this part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I 
might be ready when it was ebbed out ; and by this time I had 
got timber and plank and iron-work enough to have built a good 
boat, if I had known how ; and also I got, at several times and 
in several pieces, near a hundred weight of the sheet-lead. 

June 16. — Going down to the sea-side I found a large tortoise 
or turtle. This was the first I had seen, which, it seems, was only 
my misfortune, not any defect of the place ; for had I happened 
to be on the other side of the island, 1 might have had hundreds 
of them every day, as I found afterwards, but perhaps had paid 
dear enough for them. 

June 17. — I spent in cooking the turtle : I found in her three- 
score eggs ; and her flesh was to me at that time the most sa- 
voury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had no 
flesh but of goats and fowls since I landed in this horrid place. 

June 18. — Rained all day, and I stayed within. 1 thought at 
this time the rain felt cold, and I was rather chilly, which I knew 
was not usual in that latitude. 

June 19. — Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been 
cold. 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 51 

June 20. — No rest all night ; violent pains in my head, and 
feverish. 

June 22.— A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions 
of sickness. 

June 23. — ^Very ill again ; cold and shivering, and then a 
violent headache. 

June 24. — ^An ague very violent : the fit held me seven hours, 
cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it. 

June 26. — Better ; and having no victuals to eat, took my 
gun, but found myself very .weak. However I killed a she-goat, 
and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it, 
and eat ; I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but 
had no pot. 

June 27. — ^The ague again so violent that I lay in bed all day, 
and neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for thirst, but so 
weak I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any water 
to drink. At last, the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not 
wake till far in the night. When I waked I found myself much 
refreshed, but weak and exceeding thirsty ; however, as I had no 
water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, 
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this ter- 
rible dream. 

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the outside of 
my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, 
and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud in a bright 
flame of fire, and alight upon the ground. He was all over as 
bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards 
him ; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible 
for words to describe. When he stepped upon the ground, I 
thought the earth trembled just as it had done before in the earth- 
quake; and all the air looked to my apprehension as if it had been 
filled with flashes of fire. 

He was no sooner landed upon the earth but he moved for- 
ward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand to kill 
me ; and when he came to a rising ground at some distance he 
spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impossible to 
express the terror of it. All that I can say I understood was this: 
** Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now 
thou shalt die \" at which words I thought he lifted up the spear 
that was in his hand to kill me. 

No one that shall ever read this account will expect that I 
should be able to describe the horrors of my soul at this terrible 
vision ; I mean, that even while it was a dream I even dreamed 
of those horrors ; nor is it any more possible to describe the im- 
pression that remained upon my mind when I awaked, and found 
it was but a dream. 

I had, alas ! no religious knowledge ; what I had received by 
the good instruction of my father was then woiii OMtb^ ^\i m\>^« 



52 LIFE AND ADYENTURRS 

terrupted series for eight years of seafaring wickedness. I do not 
remember that I had in all that time one thought that so much as 
tended either to looking upwards towards God, or inwards to- 
wards a reflection upon my own ways ; but a certain stupidity of 
soul, without desire of good or conscience of evil, had over- 
whelmed me, and I was all that the most hardened and unthink- 
ing creature among our common sailors can be supposed to be, 
having no sense either of the fear of God in danger or of thank- 
fulness to God in deliverances. 

When I got on shore first here, and found all my ship's crew 
drowned and myself spared, I was surprised with a kind of 
ecstasy and some transports of soul ; but it ended where it begun, 
in a mere common flight of joy, or, as I may say, being glad I 
was alive, without the least reflection upon the distinguishing 
goodness of the hand which had preserved me, and had singled 
me out to be preserved, when all the rest were destroyed ; or an 
inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me : even just 
the same common sort of joy which seamen generally have after 
they have got safe on shore from a shipwreck, whicii they drown 
all in the next bowl of punch, and forget it almost as soon as it is 
over ; and all the rest of my life was like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made 
sensible of my condition ; how I was cast on this dreadiiil place, 
out of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief or pro- 
spect of redemption ; as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and 
that I should not perish for hunger, all the sense of my affliction 
wore off*, and I began to be very easy, applied myself to the 
works proper for my preservation and supply, and was far enough 
from being afflicted at my condition as a judgment from heaven 
or as the hand of God against me : these were thoughts which 
very seldom entered into my head. 

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had at 
first some little influence upon me, and began to aflect me with 
seriousness as long as I thought it had something miraculous in 
it ; but as soon as ever that thought was removed, all the im- 
pression which was raised from it wore off* also, as I have noted 
already. 

But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the 
miseries of death came to place itself before me ; when my spirits 
began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature 
was exhausted with the violence of the fever, conscience, that had 
slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach myself 
with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon 
wickedness, provoked the justice of God to lay me under un- 
common strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner. 

These reflections oppressed me from the second or third day 
of my distemper ; and in the violence, as well of the fever as of 
the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOX. 53 

from me like praying to God, though I cannot say they were 
either a prayer attended with desires or with hopes ; it was rather 
the voice of mere fright and distress ; my thoughts were contused, 
the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror of dying in 
such a miserable condition raised vapours into my head with the 
mere apprehensions ; and in these hurries of my soul I know not 
what my tongue might express. But it was rather exclamations ; 
such as, '''Lord, what a miserable creature am I ! If I should be 
sick, I shall certainly die for want of help, and what will become 
of me V* Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could say 
no more for a good while. 

In this interval the good advice of my father came to my 
mind, and presently his prediction, which I mentioned in the be- 
ginning of this story, namely, that if I did take this fooh'sh step, 
Gob would not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to 
reflect upon having neglected his counsel, when there might be 
none to assist in my recovery. *• Now,*' said I aloud, " my dear 
father's words are come to pass ; God's justice has overtaken me, 
and I have none to help or hear me; I rejected the voice of 
Providence, which had mercifully put me in a posture or station 
of life wherein I might have been happy ; but I would neither see 
it myself nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents ; I 
left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn 
under the consequences of it ; I refused their help and assistance, 
and now I have difficulties to struggle with too great for even 
nature itself to support, and no assistance, no help, no comfort, 
no advice." Then I cried out, *' Lord, be my help ; for I am 
in great distress !" 

Jwie 28. — Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I 
had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up ; and though the 
fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I considered 
that the fit of the ague would return again the next day, and now 
was my time to get something to refresh and support myself when 
I should be ill ; and the first thing I did I filled a large square 
case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table in reach of my 
bed ; and to take off the chill or aguish disposition of the water, I 
put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and mixed them to- 
gether. Then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh, and broiled it 
on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked about, but was 
very weak, and withal very sad and heavy-hearted under a sense 
of my miserable condition, dreading the return of my distemper 
the next day. At night I made my supper of three of the turtle's 
eergs, which I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in the 
shell ; and this was the first bit of meat I had ever asked God's 
blessing to, even, as I could remember, in my whole life. 

After I had eaten I tried to walk, but found myself so weak 
that I could hardly carry the gun, for I never went out without 
that ; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground^ 

r2 



54 LIFE AND ADYEimiRBd 

looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very calm 
and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these occurred 
tome: 

What is the earth and sea, of which I hayd seen so much? 
Whence is it produced ? And what am I, and all the other crea- 
tures, wild and tame, human and brutal ; whence are we ? 

Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who formed the 
earth and sea, the air and sky ; and who is that? 

Then it followed, most naturally, it is God that has made it 
all. Well, but then it came on strangely, if God has made all 
these things. He guides and governs them all, and all things that 
concern them ; for the Being that could make all things must 
certainly have power to guide and direct them. 

If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of His works 
either without His knowledge or appointment. 

And if nothing happens without His knowledge, He knows 
that I am here, and am in this dreadful condition ; and if nothing 
happens without His appointment, He has appointed all this to 
befall me. 

Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of these 
conclusions ; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater 
force, that it must needs be that God had appointed all this to 
befall me ; that I was brought to this miserable circumstance by 
His direction. He having the sole power, not of me only, but of 
every thing that happened in the world. Immediately it fol- 
lowed : 

Why has God done this to me ? What have I done to be thus 
used? 

My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I had 
bla8pnemed,and methought it spoke to me like a voice, "Wretch, 
dost thou ask what thou hast done ? Look back upon a dreadful 
misspent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done ? Ask, why 
is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed ? why wert thou not 
drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the fight when the ship 
was taken by the Sallee man-of-war? devoured by the wild beasts 
on the coast of Africa ? or drowned here when all the crew perished 
but thyself? Dost thou ask, what have I done V* 

I was struck with these reflections as one astonished, and had 
not a word to say, no, not to answer to myself ; but rose up pen- 
sive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my 
wall, as if I had been going to bed. But my thoughts were sadly 
disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep ; so I sat down in my 
chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the 
apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me very 
much, it occurred to me that the Brazilians take no physic but 
their tobacco for almost all distempers ; and I had a piece of a 
roll of tobacco in one of the chests which was quite cured, and 
some also that was green and not quite cured. 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 55 

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt ; for in'tbis chest I found 
a cure both for soul and body ! I opened the chest, and found 
what I looked for, namely, the tobacco ; and as the few books I 
had saved lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which I 
mentioned before, and which to this time I had not found leisure 
or 80 much as inclination to look into. I say I took it out, and 
brought both that and the tobacco with me to the table. 

What use to make of the tobacco I knew not as to my dis- 
temper, or whether it was good for it or no ; but I tried several 
experiments with it, as if I resolved it should hit one way or 
other. 

In the interval of this operation, I took up the Bible, and be- 
gan to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the 
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time ; only having opened 
the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were these : 
'^ Call on Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and 
thou shalt glorify Me.*' 

The words were very apt to my case, and made some impres- 
sion upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not 
80 much as they did afterwards. It grew now late, and the to- 
bacco had confused my head so much that I inclined to sleep ; so 
I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want any thing 
in the night, and went to bed ; but before I lay down I did what 
I never had done in all my life ; I kneeled down and prayed to 
God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called upon Him in the 
day of trouble. He would deliver me. After my broken and im- 
perfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had steeped 
the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco that in- 
deed I could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went 
to bed, and I found presently it flew up into my head violently ; 
but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more till by the sun it 
must necessarily have been near three o'clock in the afternoon the 
next day ; nay, I am partly of the opinion that I slept all the next 
day and night, and till almost three the day after ; for otherwise I 
knew not how I should lose a day out of my reckoning in the days 
of the week, as it appeared some years after I had done ; for if I 
had lost it by crossing and recrossing the line, I should have lost 
more than one day ; but certainly I lost a day in my account, and 
never knew which way. 

Be that, however, one way or other, when I waked, I found 
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful. 
When I got up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and 
my Htomach better, for I was hungry ; and, in short, I had no fit 
the next day, but continued much altered for the better. This 
was the 29th. 

July 3. — While I was thus gathering strength, my thoughts 
ran exceedingly upon the Scripture, ** 1 will deliver thee ;" and 
the impossibility of my deliverance lay much upon my mlnd^ ixv 



56 LIFE AND ADYENTUSES 

bar of my ever expecting it. But as I was discouraging myself 
with such thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored so much 
upon my deliverance from the main affliction, that I disregarded 
the deliverance I had received ; and I was, as it were, made to 
ask myself such questions as these : viz. Have I not been deli- 
livered, and wonderfully too, from sickness? from the most dis- 
tressed condition that could be, and that was so frightful to me ? 
and what notice had I taken of it? had I done mv part? God 
had delivered me ; but I had not glorified Him : that is to say, I 
had not owned and been thankful for that as a deliverance ; and 
how could I expect greater deliverance ? 

This touched my heart very much ; and immediately I kneeled 
down, and gave God thanks aloud for my recovery from my 
sickness. 

July 4. — In the morning I took the Bible ; and, beginning at 
the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and resolved to 
read awhile every morning and every night, not tying myself to 
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts should engage 
me. It was not long after I set seriously to this work, but I found 
my heart more deeply and sincerely affected with the wickedness 
of my past life; the impression of my dream revived, and the 
words, ** All these things have not brought thee to repentance," 
ran seriously in my thoughts. I was earnestly begging of God 
to give me repentance, when it happened providentially the very 
day, that, reading the Scripture, I came to these words : " He is 
exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give 
remission." I threw down the book, and with my heart as well 
as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a kind of ecstasy of joy I cried 
out aloud, " Jesus, Thou Son of David, Jesus, Thou exalted 
Prince and Saviour, give me repentance 1" 

This was the first time that I could say, in the true sense of 
the words, that I prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with 
a sense of my condition, and with a true scripture view of hope, 
founded on the encouragement of the word of God ; and from this 
time, I may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me. 

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above, " Call 
on Me, and 1 will deliver thee," in a different sense from what I 
had ever done before ; for then I had no notion of any thing being 
called deliverance but my being delivered from the captivity I 
was in ; for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet the 
island was certainly a prison to me, and that in the worst sense 
in the world ; but now 1 learned to take it in another sense. Now 
I looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my sins 
appeared so dreadful, that mjr soul sought nothing of God but 
deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down allmy comfort. 
As for my solitary life, it was nothing ; I did not so much as pray 
to be delivered from it, or think of it ; it was all of no consider- 
ation in comparison of this \ and I add this part here^ to hint to 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 57 

\irhoeYet shall read it, that whenever they come to a true sense of 
things, they will find deliverance from sin a much greater blessing 
than deliverance from affliction. 

But, leaving this, I return to my journal. 

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in 
walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a 
time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of 
sickness ; for it is hardly to be imagined to what weakness I was 
reduced. The application which I made use of was perfectly jiew, 
and perhaps what had never cured an ague before ; neither can I 
recommend it to any one to practise by this experiment; and 
though it did carry off" the fit, yet it rather contributed to weaken 
me ; for I had friequent convulsions in my nerves and limbs for 
some time. 

I learnt from it also this in particular ; that being abroad in 
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that 
could be, especially in those rains which came attended with 
storms and hurricanes of wind ; for as the rain which came in a 
dry season was always most accompanied with such storms, so I 
found this rain was much more dangerous than the rain which fell 
in September and October. 

I bad been now in the island above ten months. All possibility 
of deliverance from this condition seemed to be entirely taken 
from me ; and I firmly believed that no human shape had ever set 
foot upon that place. Having now secured my habitation as I 
thought fully to my mind, I had a great desire to make a more 
perfect survey of the island, and to see what other productions 
I might find, which I yet knew nothing of. 

Accordmgly, on the 15th of July I began my tour of discovery. 
I went up the creek first, where I brought my rafts on shore. I 
found, after I got about two miles up, that tne tide did not fiow 
any higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of running 
water, and very fresh and good ; but this being the dry season, 
there was hardly any water in some parts of it, at least not enough 
to run in any stream, so as it could be perceived. 

On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant savannas, or 
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the 
rising parts of them, next to the higher grounds, where the water, 
as it might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of 
tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk ; 
there were several other plants which I had no notion ot, or un- 
derstanding about ; perhaps having virtues of their own, which I 
could not find out. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; and, 
after goins something farther than I had done the day before, I 
found the orook and the meadows began to cease, and the coun- 
try became more woody than before. In this part I found differ- 
ent fruits^ and particularly melons, in great abundauce >r^^\!w 



58 LIFE AND ADVBNTUBES 

the ground, and grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread 
indeed over the trees, and tne clusters of grapes were just now in 
their prime, very ripe and rich. This wb» a surprising discovery, 
and I was exceedingly glad of them ; but I was warned by my ex- 
perience to eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I was 
ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed several of our 
Englishmen who were slaves there, by throwing them into fluxes 
and fevers ; but I found an excellent use for these grapes, and that 
was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and keep them as dried grapes 
or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as indeed they 
were, as wholesome^ and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes might 
be had. 

I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habi- 
tation, which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I 
had passed from home. In the night I got up into a tree, where I 
slept well, and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery, 
travelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the 
valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south 
and north side of me. 

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the 
country seemed to descend to the west ; and a little spring of 
fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran 
the other way, that is, due east ; and the country appeared so 
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant 
verdure or flourishing of spring, that it looked like a planted 
garden. 

I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley, survey- 
ing it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with other 
afflicting thoughts) to think that this was all my own, that I was 
king and lord of all this country, and had a right of possession ; 
and if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance, as com- 
pletely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here abundance 
of cocoa-trees, orange, and lemon, and citron-trees, but all wild, 
and few bearing any fruit, at least not then ; however, the green 
limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very \i'hole- 
some ; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made 
it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. 

I found now I had business enough to gather and carry home ; 
and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as of limes 
and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew 
was approaching. 

In order to do this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one 
place, and a lesser heap in another place, and likewise a great 
parcel of limes and lemons ; and taking a few of each with me, I 
travelled homeward, and resolved to come again, and bring a bag 
or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home. 

Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I re- 
turned to my tent and my cave 5 but before I got thither the 



CH. O. OF BOBIXSD3r CKTIOK. 59 



CTapes were spoiled ; ibe rirfawB of die firvit, and die weight oC 
Uie jnice, IttTins' broken dw^, and brvbed them, dier were good 
for Uttle or nothing; as to the IImi* \ ther were good, b«t I ebold 
bring but a few. 

'Hie next day. bein? die iMu I went badk. baring made me 
two small bags to briikg home mr harrest. Bat I was surprised 
when, coming to my heap <^grape». which were :so rich and fine 
when I gathered them. I fiMoid then aO spread abroad, trod to 
pieces, and diagged about, some herein some there, and ahnndance 
eaten and deronred. Bt this I coocfaided there were some wild 
creatures thereaboats^ which had done this ; hot what ther were 
I knew not. 

However, as I fimnd diere was no laying them op on heaps, 
and no carrying them away in a aadk. bat that one way they 
woold be destrored, and the other war theT woold be crashed 
with their own we^ht, I took another course ; for I gathered a 
large quantity of the grapes, and hong them upon the out branches 
of the trees, that they might coie and dry in the son ; and as ior 
the limes and lemons^ I carried as many back as I could well 
stand onder. 

When I came home from tlus journey. I contemplated with 
great pleasure on the frnitlalneas of that valley, and the pleasant- 
ness of the situation, the secnrity fiom 9tonns on that side of the 
water, and the wood : and concluded that I had pitched upon a 
place to fix my abode which was by far the worst part of the 
country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of remoTing my 
habitation, uid to lock, out for a place equaUy safe as where I 
now was situated, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the 
island. 

This thought ran long in my head, and I was very fond of it 
for some time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but 
when I came to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I was now 
by the sea-side, where it was at least possible that something might 
happen to my advantage, and that the same ill fiite that brought 
me hither might bring some other unhappy persons to the same 
place ; and though it was scarcely probable that any such thine 
should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the hills and 
woods, in the centre of the island, was to render such an afiair not 
only improbable but impossible, and that therefore I ought not 
by any means to remove. 

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much 
of my time there for the whole remaining part of the month of 
July ; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved as above, not 
to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and surrounded 
it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double hedge, as high 
as I could reach, well staked, and filled between with brushwood. 
And here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights to- 
gether, always going over it with a laddei, as \)e£ot«\ «k> i^^\.\ 



60 LIFB AND ADVENTtrxXS 

fancied now I had my countrv-house and my sea-coast house ; and 
this work took me up to the beginning of August. 

I had but newly finished my fence, a!nd oegun to enjoy my 
labour, when the rains came on, and made me stick close to my 
first habitation ; for though I had miade me a tent like the other, 
with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the 
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind me to 
retreat into when the rains were extraordinary. 

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my 
bower, and began to enjoy myself. By the third of August I found 
the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were 
excellent good raisins of the sun. So I began to take them down 
from the trees ; and it was very fortunate that I did so ; for the 
rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I should have 
lost the best part of my winter food ; for I had above two hundred 
large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, 
and carried most of them home to my cave, than it began to 
rain; and from thence, which was the 14th of August, it rained 
more or less every day till the middle of October ; and some- 
times so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several 
days. 

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my 
family. I had been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who 
ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead ; and I heard 
no more tidings of her, till, to my astonishment, she came home 
about the end of August with three kittens. 

From the 14th of August to the 26th incessant rain, so that I 
could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet. 
In this confinement I began to be straitened for food ; but ven- 
turing out twice, I one day killed a goat ; and the last day, 
which was the 26th, found a very large tortoise, which was a 
treat to me. And my food was regulated thus : I eat a bunch of 
raisins for breakfast, a piece of the goat's fiesh, or qf the turtle, 
for my dinner, broiled (for, to my great misfortune, I had no 
vessel to boil or stew any thing), and two or three of the turtle's 
eggs for supper. 

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked 
daily two or three hours at enlarging my cave ; and, by degrees, 
worked it on towards one side till I came to the outside of the 
hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence 
or wall, and so I came in and out this way. But I was not per- 
fectly easy at lying so open ; for as I had managed myself^ be- 
fore, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now I thought I lay 
exposed ; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living 
thing to fear, tne biggest creature that I had seen upon the island 
being a goat. 

Sept. 30. — I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of 
my landing. I cast up the notches on my post, and found I had 



CH. II. OF &OBIN80N CRUSOE. 61 

been on shore 365 days. I kept this day as a solemn fast, set- 
ting it apart to a re&gious exercise, prostrating myself on the 
ground with the most serious hamiliation, confessmg my sins 
to Gob, acknowledeing His righteous judgments upon me, and 
praying to Him to have mercy on me through Jesus Christ ; 
and haying not tasted the least refreshment for twelve hours, 
eyen to the going down of the sun, I then eat a biscuit-cake 
and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as I 
began it. 

I had all this time obseryed no Sunday ; for, as at first I had 
no sense of religion upon my mind, I had after some time 
omitted to distinguish the weeks by making a longer notch than 
ordinary for the Sunday, and so did not really know what any 
of the days were ; but now, having cast up the days as aboye, I 
found I had been there a year ; so I divided it into weeks, and set 
apart every seventh day for a Sunday ; though I found at the end 
of my account I had lost a day or two in my reckoninff. 

A little after this my ink began to fail me ; and so I contented 
myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most 
remarkable eyents of my life^ without continuing a daily memo- 
randum of other things.

late waa one of the most itiacou raging ex peri men ta utat T made 
at all. I have mentioned, that I had savea the few eare of barley 
and rice which I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, 
of themselvea, and believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, 
and about twenty of barley ; and now I thought it a proper 
time U> BOW it after the rains, the suo being in its southern posi- 
tion, going from me. 

Accordingly, 1 dug up a piece of ^ouod, as well as I could, 
with my worfen spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed 
my grain ; hut as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my 
thought, that I would not sow it all at first, because I did not 
know when was the proper time for it; bo I sowed about two- 
thirds of the seeds, leaving about a handful of each. It was a 
great comfort to me afterwards that I did so; for not one grain 
of that I sowed this time came to any thing ; for the dry months 
following, the earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, 
it had no moisture to assist it» growth, and never came up at all 
till the wet season had come again, and then it grew as if it had 
been newly sown. 

Finding my first fieed did not grow, which I easilv imagined 
was by the drought, I souo'ht for a moister piece of ground to 
make another trial in ; and I dug up a piece of erounif near my 
new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in Felintary, a little 
hetbre the vernal equinox ; and this, having the miny months of 
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and 



CH III. ADYSNTUBBS OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 63 

yielded a very good crop ; but having part of the seed left only, 
and not daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but a small quan- 
tity at last, my whole crop not amounting to aboye half a peck 
of each kind* 

But by this experience I was made master of my business, 
and knew exactly when the proper season was to sow; and 
that I might expect two seed-times^ and two harvests^ every 
year. 

While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which 
was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over, 
and the weather began to settle, which was about the month of 
November, I made a visit up the country to my bower, where, 
though I had not been some months, yet I found all things just 
as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I had made was 
not only firm and entire, but the stakes, which I had cut off of 
some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out and grown 
with long branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the 
first year after lopping its head. I could not tell what tree to 
call it that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet 
▼«ry well pleased, to see the young trees grow, and I pruned 
iiiem and led them up to grow as much alike as I could ; and it 
is scarcely credible how beautiful a figure they grew into in three 
years ; so that, though the hedge made a circle of about twenty- 
five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call 
them, soon covered it ; and it was a complete shade, sufiicient to 
lodffe under all the dry season. 

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make me 
a hedge like this in a semi-circle round my wall, I mean that of 
my first dwelling, which I did ; and placing the trees or stakes in 
a double row, at about eight yards' distance from my first fence, 
they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habita- 
tion, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe 
in its order. 

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be 
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the 
rainy seasons and the dry seasons; which were generally thus : 

Half February, March, half April, rainy; the sun being then 
on or near the equinox. 

Half April, May, June, July, half August, dry; the sun being 
then to the north of the line. 

Half August, September, half October, rainy ; the sun being 
then come back. 

Half October, November, December, January, half February, 
dry ; the sun being then to the south of the line. 

The rainy season sometimes continued longer or shorter as 
the winds happened to blow ; but this was the general observa- 
tion I made. After I had found by experience the ill conse- 
quence of being abroad in the rain, I took care to fvitiiV&YvTSi^^^l

64 LIFE AND ADVBNTURBS 

-with provision beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go 
out ; and I sat within doors as much as possible during the wet 
months. 

In this time I found much employment (and very suitable also 
to the time) ; for I found great occasion of many things which I 
had no way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and con- 
stant application ; particularly, I tried many ways to make my- 
self a basket, but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved 
so brittle that they would do nothing. It proved of much advan- 
tage to me now, that when I was a boy I used to take great 
delight in standing at a basket-maker's in the town where my 
father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware ; and being, as 
boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of 
the manner how they worked those things, and sometimes lend- 
ing a hand, I had by this means so full a knowledge of the methods 
of it, that I wanted nothing but the materials, when it came into 
my mind that the twigs of the tree from whence I cut my stakes 
that grew might possibly be as tough as the willows and osiers in 
England, and I resolved to try. 

Accordingly, the next day I went to my country-house, as I 
called it, and cutting some ot the smaller twigs, I found them to 
my purpose as much as I could desire ; whereupon I came the 
next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which 
I soon found, for there was a great plenty of them. These I set 
up to dry within my circle or hedges, and when they were fit for 
use, I carried them to my cave ? and here, during the next sea- 
son, I employed myself in making a great many baskets, both to 
carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing, as I had occasion ; 
and though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made 
them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose ; and thus after- 
wards I took care never to be without them. 

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of 
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply 
two wants. I had no vessels to contain any thing that was 
liquid, except two runlets, which were almost full of rum, and 
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others which 
were case-bottles, square, for the holding of waters, spirits, &c. 
I had not so much as a pot to boil any tiling in, except a great 
kettle which I saved out of the ship, and which was ^too big for 
such uses as I desired for it, viz. to make broth and stew a bit of 
meat by itself. The second thing I would fain have had, was a 
tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for me to make one ; how- 
ever I. found a contrivance for that too, at last. 

I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes of 
piles,' and in this wicker-work, all the summer or dry season, 
when . another business took me . up more time than it could be 
ima^ned I could spare. 

I mentioned betbre that I had a great mind to see the whole

island^ and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where 
I built my tower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea, 
on the otner side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite 
across to the sea-shore on that side ; so taking my gun and hat- 
chet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot than 
usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my 
pouch for my store, I began my journey. When I had passed 
the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of 
the sea, to the west ; and it being a very clear day, I fairly des- 
cried land, whether an island or continent I could not tell, but it 
lay very high, extending from the west to the w.s.w., at a very 
great distance : by my guess it could not be less than fifteen or 
twenty leagues off. 

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, other- 
wise than that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I con- 
cluded by all my observations, must be near the Spanish domi- 
nions, and perhaps was all inhabited by sava^s, where, if I 
should have landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was 
now ; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of Provi- 
dence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered every 
thing for the best. 

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered, that 
if this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time 
or other, see some vessels pass or repass one way or other ; but 
if not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country 
and Brazil, inhabited, indeed, by the worst of savages, for they 
are cannibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour 
all the human bodies that fall into their hands. 

With these considerations I walked very leisurely forward. I 
found that side of the island where I now was much pleasanter 
than mine ; the open fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, 
and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of parrots, and 
I would fain have caught one, if possible, to have kept it to be 
tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after some pains 
taken, catch a young parrot ; for I knocked it down with a stick, 
and, having recovered it, I brought it home ; but it was some 
years before I could make him speak. However, at last I taught 
him to call me by my name very familiarly : but the accident 
that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its 
place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I found in the 
low grounds hares, as I thought them to be, and foxes, but they 
differed greatly from all the other kinds 'I had met with ; nor 
could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several. But 
I had no need to be venturous, for I had no want of food, and 
of that which was very good too ; especially these three sorts, 
viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise, which, added to my 
grapes, Leadenhall market could not have furnished a bettAt

66 LIFB AND ADYBNTDRBS 

table tban I in proportion to the company ; and though my case 
was deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness, 
that I was not driven to any extremities for food, but rather had 
plenty, even to dainties. 

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I found indeed that 
I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for 
here the shore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas 
on the other side, I had found but three in a year and a half. 
Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, some 
of which I had not seen before^ and many of them very good 
meat, but such as I knew not the names of, except those called 
penguins. 

1 could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing 
of my powder and shot ; and therefore had more mind to kill a 
she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on ; and though 
there were many more goats here than on the other side of the 
island, yet it was with much more difRculty that I could come 
near them ; the country being flat and even, and they saw me 
much sooner than when I was on the hills. 

Although this side of the country was much pleasanter than 
mine, I had not the least inclination to remove ; for as I was fixed 
in my habitation, it became natural to me ; and I seemed all the 
while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey, and from 
home. However, I travelled along the shore of the sea towards 
the east, I suppose, about twelve miles ; and then setting up a 
great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would go 
' home again ; and the next journey I took should be on the other 
side of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round, till I 
came to my post again. 

I took another way to return than that I went, thinking I 
could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I could 
not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country ; but 
I found myself mistaken; for being come about two or three 
miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley ; but so 
surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with woods, that 
I could not see which was my way by^ any direction but that of 
the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the position of 
the sun at that time of the day. 

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved 
hazy for three or four days, while I was in this valley ; and not 
being able to see the sun, 1 wandered about very uncomfortably, 
and at last was obliged to find out the sea-side, look for my post, 
and come back the same way I went ; and then, by easy journeys, 
I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot, and my 
gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very neavy. 

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized 
upon it ; and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved 
it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home, if 



CH. III. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 67 

ft 

I could ; for I had often been musing whether it might not be 
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats, 
which might supply me when my powder and shot shomd be 
spent. 

I made a collar for this little creature ; and with a string 
which I made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about 
me, I led him along, though with some difKculty, till I came to 
my bower, and there I enclosed him, and left him ; for I was 
very impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent 
above a month. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into 
my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock- bed. This little 
wandering journey, without a settled place of abode, had been so 
unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself, 
was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that ; and it ren- 
dered every thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved I 
would never go a great way from it again, while it should be my 
lot to stay on the island. 

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after 
my long journey ; during which, most of the time was taken up 
in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who began 
now to be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted 
with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid, which I had 
pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it 
home, and give it some food ; accordingly I went, and found it 
where I left it ; for indeed it could not get out, but was almost 
starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees and 
branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over; and 
having fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it away ; but it was 
so tame with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it ; 
for it followed me like a dog ; and as I continually fed it, the 
creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became 
from that time one of my domestics also, and would never leave 
me afterwards. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and. 
I kept the SOth of September in the same solemn manner as 
before, being the anniversary of mv landing on the island, hav- 
ing now been here two years, and no more prospect of being 
delivered than the first day I came. I spent the whole day in 
humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful 
mercies which my solitary condition was attended with, and 
without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I 
gave humble and hearty thanks, that God had been pleased to 
discover to me, even that it was possible I might be more happy 
in this solitary conditi<in than I should have been in society, and 
in all the pleasures of the world ; that He could fully make up 
to me the aeficiencies of my solitary state and the want of human 
society by His presence, and the communications of His grace 



68 LIFE AND ADVBNTUBES 

to my soul, supportiog, comforting, and encouraging me to de- 

Eend upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal presence 
ereafter. 

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more 
happy the life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, 
than the wicked lite I led all the past part of my days ; and now, 
having changed both my sorrows and my joys, my very desires 
altered, my affections changed, and my delights were perfectly new 
from what they were at first coming, or, indeed, for two years past. 

In this disposition of mind, 1 began my third year ; and 
though I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular 
an account of my works this year as at the first, yet in general it 
may be observed, that I was very seldom idle ; having regularly 
divided my time, according to the several daily employments 
that were Defore me ; such as, first, my devotions, for which I 
constantly set apart some time thrice every day. Secondly, the 
going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up 
three hours every morning when it did not rain. Thirdly, the 
ordering, curing, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or 
caught for my supply. These took up great part of the day, 
Also it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, when 
the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too ^reat 
to stir out ; so that about four hours in the evening was all the 
time I could be supposed to work in ; with this exception, that 
sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, and 
went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun m the 
afternoon. 

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added 
the exceeding laboriousness of my work ; the many hours which, 
for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, every thing 
that I did took up out of my time : for example, I was full two- 
and-forty days making me a board for a long shelf, which I 
wanted in my cave ; whereas two sawyers, with their tools and 
saw-pits, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half 
a day. 

My case was this : It was to be a large tree which was to be 
cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. The tree 
I was three days a cutting down, and two more cutting off the 
boughs, and reducinff it to a log, or piece of timber. With inex- 
pressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it into 
chips, till it began to be light enough to move ; then I turned it, 
and made one side of it smooth ana fiat, as a board, from end to 
end ; then turning that side downward, cut the other side till I 
brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on 
both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a 
piece of work ; but labour and patience carried me through that 
and many other things. I only observed this in particular, to 
shew the reason why so much of my time went away with so 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 69 

little work, viz. that what might be a little to be done with help 
and tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious time to 
do alone and by hand. 

But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went 
through many things, and indeed every thing that my circum- 
stances made necessary for me to do, as will appear by what 
follows. 

1 was now in the months of November and December, ex- 
pecting my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured 
or dug up for them was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of 
each was not above the quantity of half a peck, for I had lost one 
whole crop by sowing in the dry season. But now my crop pro- 
mised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger of 
losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce 
possible to keep from it ; at first, the goats, and wild creatures 
which I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of the blade, 
lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so 
close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalks. 

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an enclosure about 
it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil ; and the 
more, because it required a great deal of speed, the creatures 
daily spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land was but 
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about 
three weeks time ; and shooting some of tne creatures in the day- 
time, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a 
stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night long ; 
so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn 
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me betbre, while my corn was in the 
blade, so the birds were as like to ruin me now, when it was in 
the ear ; for going alon^ by the place to see how it throve, I saw 
my little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not how many 
sorts, which stood as it were watching till I should be gone. I 
immediately let fly among them (for I always had my gun with 
me). I had no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud of 
fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself. 

This touched me sensibly ; for I foresaw that in a few days they 
would devour all my hopes, that I should be starved, and never 
be able to raise a crop at all ; and what to do I could not tell. 
However, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though I 
should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among 
it to see what damage was already done, and found they had 
spoiled a good deal of it ; but that, as it was yet too green for 
them, the loss was not so great, but the remainder was like to be 
a good crop if it could be Mived. 

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could 
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they 
only waited till I was gone away ; and the event proved it 1<^ \^^ 



70 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

80 ; for as I walked off, as if I was gone, I was do sooner out of 
their sight but they dropped down one by one into the corn again. 
I was so provoked that I could not have patience to stay till more 
came on, knowing that every grain they eat now was, so to 
speak, a peck-loaf to me in the consequence ; but coming up to 
the hedge I fired again, and killed three of them. This was what 
I wished for ; so I took them up, and served them as we serve 
notorious thieves in England, namely, hanged them in chains for 
a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine almost that this 
should have such an effect as it had ; for the fowls would not only 
not come at the corn, but in short they forsook all that part of 
the island, and I could never see a bird near the place as long as 
my scarecrows hung there. 

This I was very glad of, you may be sure ; and'about the latter 
end of December, which was our second harvest of the year, I 
reaped my corn. 

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, 
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one 
of the broad-swords or cutlasses which I saved amon^ the arms 
out of the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had no 

freat difficulty to cut it down ; in short, I reaped it m)r way ; for 
cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it away in a great 
basket which I had made, and so rubbed it out with my hands ; 
and at the end of all my harvesting I found, that out of my half- 
peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice and above two bushels 
and a half of barley. 

However, this was a srreat encouragement to me, and I fore- 
saw that in time it would please God to supply me with bread ; 
and yet here I was perplexed again, for I neither knew how to 
grind or make meal of my com, or, indeed, how to clean it and 
part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it ; and if 
how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things 
being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store, and 
to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of this 
crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season, and 
in the mean time to employ all my study and hours of working to 
accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn and 
bread. 

It might be truly said that now I worked for my bread. It is 
a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought 
much upon, namely, the strange multitude of little things neces- 
sary in the providing, producing, dressing, making, and finishing 
this one article of bread. 

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to be 
my daily discouragement, and was made more and more sensible 
of it every hour, even after I got the first handful of seed-corn, 
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to my 
^eat surprise. 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOK. 71 

First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade or shovel to 
dig it. Well, this difticulty I conquered by making a wooden 
spade, as I observed before ; but this did my work in but a wooden 
manner, and though it cost me a great many days to make it, yet 
for want of iron it not only wore out the sooner, but made my 
work the harder, and made it be performed much worse. 

However, this I bore with too, and was content to work it out 
with patience, and bear with the badness of the performance. 
When the corn was sowed I had no harrow; but was forced to go 
over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it 
to scratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than rake or 
harrow it. 

When it was growing or grown, I have observed already how 
many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, 
carry it home, thresh, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then 
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to 
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it in ; and all these things 
I did without, as shall be observed ; and yet the corn was an in- 
estimable comfort and advantage to me too. But all this, as [ 
said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me ; but that there 
was no help for ; neither was my time so much loss to me. A 
certain part of it was every day appointed to these works; and 
as I resolved to use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater 
quantity by me, I had the next six months to apply myself, 
wholly by labour and invention, to furnish myself with utensils 
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for the 
making the com, when I had it, fit for my use. 

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed 
enough to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had 
a week's work at least to make me a spade, which, when it was 
done, was a very poor one indeed, and very heavy, and required 
double labour to work with it. However, I went through that, 
and sowed my seeds in two large fiat pieces of ground, as near 
my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in 
with a ffood hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that wood 
which I had set before, wliicb I knew would grow ; so that in one 
year's time I knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that 
would want but little repair. 

When it rained and I could not go out, I found employment 
in the following manner, always observing that all the while I was 
at work I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and teach- 
ing him to speak ; and I quickly taught him to know his own 
name, at last to speak it out pretty loud, " Poll," which was the 
first word I ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but 
my own. This, therefore, was not my work, but an assistant to 
my work ; for now, as I said, I had a great employment upon 
my hands, as follows, namely, I had long studied, by some means 
or other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which, indeed^ I 



72 LIFB AND ADVBNTUBBS 

wanted sorely, but knew not how to come at them. However^ 
considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could 
find out any clay I might botch up some such pot as, being dried 
by the sun, mignt be strong enough to bear handling, and to hold 
any thing that was dry and required to be kept so ; and as this 
was necessary in preparing com, meal, &c., I resolved to make 
Some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like jars to hold 
what should be put into them. 

It would make the reader laugh to tell how many awkward 
ways I took to raise this paste, what odd misshapen things I 
made, how many of them fell in and how many fell out, the clay 
not being stiff enough to bear its own weight ; how many cracked 
by the over- violent neat of the sun, being set out too hastily ; and 
how many fell to pieces with only removing, as well before as 
after they were dried ; and, in a word, how, after having laboured 
hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and 
work it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly things^ I 
cannot call them jars, in about two months' labour. 

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I 
lifted them gently up, and set them down again in two greater 
wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them, that they 
might not break ; and as between the pot and the basket there 
was little room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley 
straw ; and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought 
would hold my dry com, and perhaps the meal when the corn 
was braised. 

Though I succeeded so ill in my design for large pots, yet I 
made several smaller things with better success ; such as little 
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my 
hand turned to ; and the heat of the sun baked them very hard. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was, to get an 
earthen pot to hold what was liquid and bear the fire, which none 
of these would do. It happened after some time that, making a 
pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out 
after I had done with it, 1 found a broken piece of one of my 
earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone and red 
as a tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself 
that certainly they might be made to bum whole if they would 
bum broken. 

This set me to study how to arrange my fire, so as to make it 
burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the pot- 
ters bum in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some 
lead to do it with ; but I placed three large pipkins and two or 
three pots in a pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood 
all round it, with a great heap of embers under them. I plied 
the fire with fresh fuel round the outside and upon the top, till I 
saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed 
that they did not crack at all. When I saw them clear red^ I let 



CH. III. OP ROBINSON CBUSOE.' 73 

them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one 
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run ; for the sand 
which was mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the 
heat, and would have run into glass if I had gone on. So I 
slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to abate of the red 
eolour, and watching them all night, that I might not let the fire 
abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good — I will not 
say handsome — pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard 
burnt as could be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with 
the running of the sand. 

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort of 
earthenware for my use ; but as to the shapes of them, they were 
very indifierent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of 
making them but as the children make dirt-pies, or as a woman 
would make pies that never learnt to raise paste. 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine^ 
when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; 
and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold before I set 
one upon the fire again with some water in it to boil me some 
meat, which it did admirably well ; and with a piece of a kid I 
made some very good broth, though I wanted oatmeal and several 
other ingredients requisite to make it so good as I would have 
had it. 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or 
beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of 
arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To 
supply this want I was at a great loss ; for of all trades in the 
world I was as perfectly unqualified for a stonecutter as for any 
whatever ; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent 
many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow and 
make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what was 
in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out ; nor 
indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but were 
all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which would neither bear the 
weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling 
it with sand. So, after a great deal of time lost in searching for 
a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block 
of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting one 
as bi^ as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the 
outside with my axe and hatchet ; and then, with the help of fire 
and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in 
Brazil make their canoes. After this I made a great heavy pestle 
or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood, and this I prepared 
and laid by against I had my next crop of com, when I proposed 
to myself to grind, or rather pound, my corn or meal to make 
my bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve to dress my meal, and 
part it from the bran and the husk, without which I did not see it 



74 LIFB AND ADYBNTURBS 

possible I could have any bread. This was a most difficult thing, 
80 much as but to think on ; for to be sure I had nothing like the 
necessary things to make it with ; I mean, tine thin canvass or 
stuff to sift the meal through. And here I was at a full stop 
for many months, nor did I really know what to do ; linen I had 
none left but what was mere rags ; I had goat's hair, but neither 
knew I how to weave or spin it ; and had I known how, here 
were no tools to work it with. All the remedy that I found for this 
was, that at last I remembered I had among the seamen's clothes 
which were saved out of the ship some neckcloths of calico or 
muslin ; and with some pieces of these I made three small sieves, 
but proper enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for some 
years. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how 
I should make oread when I came to have corn ; for, first, I had 
no yeast. As to that part, as there was no supplying the want, so 
I did not concern myself much about it. But for an oven I was 
indeed in great trouble. At length I found out an experiment for 
that also ; which was this : I made some earthen vessels very 
broad, but not deep ; that is to say, about two feet diameter, and 
not above nine inches deep. These I burnt in the fire, as I had 
done the others, and laid them by ; and when I wanted to bake I 
made a ereat fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with some 
square tiles of my own making and burning also ; but I should 
not call them square. 

When the nre-wood was burnt pretty much into embers or 
live coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover 
it all over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was very hot ; 
then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, 
and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers 
all round the outside of the pot to keep in and add to the heat ; 
and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my 
barley-loaves, and became in a little time a pastry-cook into 
the bargain, for I made myself several cakes of the rice, and 
puddings ; indeed I made no pies, neither had I any thing to put 
into them supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or 
goats. 

It need not be wondered at if all these things took me u]) 
most part of the third year of my abode here ; for it is to be ob- 
served that, in the intervals of these things, I had my new har- 
vest and husbandry to manage ; for I reaped my corn in its 
season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up 
in the ear in my large baskets till I had time to rub it out, for I 
had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with. 

And now, indeed, my stock of com increasing, I really 
wanted to build my barns bigger : I wanted a place to lay it up 
in; for the increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I 
had of the barley about twenty bushelsy and of the rice as much^ 



CH. III. OF BOBIN80N CBU80B. 75 

or more ; insomuch, that I now resolved to begin to use it freely, 
for my bread had been quite gone a great while ; also I resolved 
to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole year, and 
to sow but once a year. 

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and 
rice were much more than I could consume in a year ; so I re- 
solved to sow just the same quantity every vear that I sowed the 
last, in hopes that such a quantity would mlly provide me with 
bread, &c. 

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my 
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had 
seen from the other side of the island ; and I was not without 
secret wishes that I was on shore there, fancying that, seeing the 
mainland, and in an inhabited country, I might find some way 
or other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some 
means of escape. 

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of 
such a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of savaees, 
and perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than 
the lions and tigers of Africa : that if I once came into Uieir 
power, I should run a hazard, more than a thousand to one, of 
beine killed, and perhaps of being eaten ; for I had heard that the 
people of the Caribbean coasts were cannibals, and I knew by the 
latitude that I could not be far ofi* from that shore ; that, sup- 
pose they were not cannibals, yet they might kill me, as many 
Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even 
when they had been ten or twenty together, much more I that 
was but one, and could make little or no defence. All these 
things, I say, which I ought to have considered well of, and I 
did cast up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took none of my ap- 
prehensions at first; and my head ran mightily upon the thoughts 
of getting over to that shore. 

Now 1 wished for my boy Xury and the long-boat with the 
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand 
miles on the coast of Africa ; but this was in vain. Then I 
thought I would go and look on our ship's boat, which, as I 
have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way in the 
storm when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she 
did at first, and was turned, by the force of the waves and the 
winds, almost bottom upwards, against the high ridge of a 
beachy rough sand, but no water about her as before. 

If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have launched 
her into the water, the boat would have done well enough, and 
I might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily ; but I 
might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her 
upright upon her bottom than I could remove the island. How- 
ever, I went to the wood and cut levers and rollers, and brought 
them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do, suggestinig to 



76 I.IFE AND ADVBNTURB8 

myself, that if I could but turn her down, I might easily repair 
the damage she had received, and she would be a very good 
boat, and I might go to sea in her very readily. 

I s])ared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless toil, and 
spent, I think, three or four weeks about it ; at last, finding it 
impossible to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to dig- 
ging away the sand, to undermine it, and so to make it fall down, 
•setting pieces of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or 
to get under it, much less to move it forwards towards the water, 
80 1 was forced to give it over ; and yet, though I gave over 
hopes of the boat, my desire to venture over to the mainland 
increased rather than decreased as the means for it seemed im- 
possible. 

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not pos- 
sible to make myself a canoe, such as the natives of those 
climates make, even without tools, or, as I might sav, without 
hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought 
possible, but easy, and pleased myself extremely with my thoughts 
of making it, and with my having much more convenience for it 
than any of the negroes or Indians ; but not at all considering 
the particular inconveniences which I lav under more than the 
Indians did, viz. want of hands to move it into the water when 
it was made, — a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than 
all the consequences of want of tools could be to them ; for what 
was it to me, that when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, 
and had with great trouble cut it down, if, after I might be able 
with my tools to hew and dub the outside into a proper shape, 
and burn or cut out the inside to make it hollow, and so to 
make a boat of it, — if, after all this, I must leave it just there 
where I found it, and not be able to launch it into the water? 

One would have thought I could not have had the least re- 
flection upon my mind of my circumstances while I was making 
my boat, or I should have immediately thought how I should 
get it into the sea ; but my thoughts were so intent upon my 
voyage in it, that I never once Considered how I should move 
it off the land ; it was really in its own nature more easy for 
me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty- 
five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water. 

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever 
man did who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself 
with the design, without determining whether I was ever able to 
undertake it ; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat 
came often into my head, but I put a stop to my own inquiries 
into it by this foolish answer which I gave myself, " Let me first 
make it, I will warrant I will find some way or other to get it 
along when it is done.'' 

This was a most preposterous notion ; but the eagerness of 



CH. UI. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 77 

my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar tree. 
I (jaestion much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the 
building the temple of Jerusalem : it was five feet ten inches 
diameter at the lower part, next the stump, and four feet eleven 
inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it les- 
sened for a while, and then parted into branches. It was not 
without immense labour that I felled this tree : I was twenty 
days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom ; I was fourteen 
more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head 
of it cut ott, which I hacked and hewed through with my axe 
and hatchet. After this it cost me a month to shape it some- 
thing like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it 
ought to do. It cost me near three months more to clear the in- 
side and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it ', this I 
did, indeed, without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the 
dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very handsome 
canoe, and big enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and 
conseauently large enouerh to have carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work I was extremely de- 
lighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than I ever 
saw a canoe that was made of one tree in my life ; there remained 
nothing but to get it into the water ; and had I been able to ac- 
complish this, I make no question but I should have begun the 
maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be performed, that 
ever was undertaken. 

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though 
they cost infinite labour too. It lay about 100 yards from the 
water, and not more ; but the first inconvenience was, it was up 
hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this obstacle, I re- 
solved to dig into the surface of the earth, and so make a decli- 
vity : this I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains ; 
but who grudge pains that have their deliverance in view ? But 
when this was worked through, and this difficulty managed, it 
was still much the same, for I could no more stir the canoe than 
I could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut 
a dock or canal to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I could 
not bring the canoe down to the water. Well, I began this 
work ; and when I began to enter into it, and calculated how 
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how much the stuff to be 
thrown out, I found that, by the number of hands I had, being 
none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve years before 
I should have gone through with it ; for the shore lay high, so 
that, at the upper end, it must have been at least twenty feet • 
deep ; so, at length, though with great reluctance, I gave this 
attempt over also. 

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late, 
the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost^ and 

h2 



78 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

JDefore we judge rightly of our own strength to go through 
with it. 

In the middle of this enterprise I finished my fourth year in 
this place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and 
with as much comfort, as ever before ; for by a constant study 
and serious application of the word of God, and by the assistance 
of His grace, I gained a diflferent knowledge from what I had 
before. I entertained different notions of things ; I looked now 
upon the world as a thing remote, which I had nothing to do 
with, no expectation from, and indeed no desires about ; in a 
word, I had nothing, indeed, to do with it, nor was ever 
like to have : so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look 
upon it hereafter, viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come 
out of. 

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the 
world here. 1 had neither ** the lust of the flesh, the lust of the 
eye, nor the pride of life.'* I had nothing to covet ; for I had all 
I was now capable of enjoying ; I was lord of the whole manor, 
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the 
whole country which I had possession of. There were no rivals ; 
I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command 
with me. I might have raised ship-loadings of com, but I had 
no use for it ; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my 
occasion. I had tortoises or turtles enough, but now and then 
one was as much as I could put to any use. I had timber enough 
to have built a fleet of ships. I had grapes enough to have made 
wine, or to have cured into raisins, sufficient to have loaded that 
fleet when it had been built. 

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable. I had 
enough to eat and to supply my wants, and what was all the rest 
to me ? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat 
it, or the vermin. If I sowed more com than I could eat, it must 
be spoiled. The trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the 

f round, I could make no more use of them than for fuel, and that 
had no occasion for but to dress my food. 
In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to 
me, upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world 
are no farther good to us than as they are for our use ; and that 
whatever we may heap up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as 
much as we can use, and no more. The most covetous miser in 
the world would have been cured of the vice of covetousness if he 
had been in my case : for I possessed infinitely more than I knew 
what to do with. I had no room for desire, unless it was of 
. things which I had not ; and they were but trifles, though indeed 
of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, 
as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling ; alas ! 
there the useless ] stufi" lay : I had no manner of business for it; 
and I often thought with myself, that I would have given a hand- 



CH. in. OF ROBnrsov crusoe. 79 

ibl of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a hand-mill to grind 
my ccHU ; nay, I would have given it all for sixpenny worth of 
tomip and carrot seed oat of England, or for a handhil of peas 
and beans, and a bottle of ink : as it was, I had not the least 
advantage by it or benefit from it, but there it lay in a drawer 
and grew rusty with the damp of the cave in the' wet season ; 
and u I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the 
same case ; and they had been of no manner of value to me, 
because of no use. 

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself 
than it was at first, and much easier to my mind as well as to my 
body. I frequently sat down to my meat Mrith thankfulness, and 
admired the hand of God's providence which had thus spread 
my table in the wilderness. I learned to look more upon the 
bright and less upon the dark side of my condition ; and to con- 
sider what I enjoyed rather than what t wanted ; and this gave 
me sometimes such secret comforts that I cannot express them, 
and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented people 
in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has 
given them, because they see and covet something that He has 
not given them : all our discontents about what we want ap- 
peared to me to spring from the want of thankfulness for wluit 
we have. 

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless 
wonld be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine 
was ; and this was, to compare my present condition with what 
I at first expected it should be ; nay, with what it would cer- 
tainly have been, if the good providence of God had not wonder- 
fully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore, where I 
not only could come at her, but could bring what I got out of 
her to the shore for my relief and comfort ; without which I had 
wanted tools to work, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and 
shot for getting my food. 

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing 
to myself in the most lively colours how 1 must have acted if I 
bad got nothing out of the ship ; how I could not have so much 
as got any food, except fish and turtles ; and that, as it was long 
before 1 ^ound any of tliem, I must have perished first ; that 1 
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage ; 
that if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no 
way to slay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin and the 
bowels, or to cut it up, but must gnaw it with my teeth, and 
pull it with m^ claws, like a beast. 

These considerations made me very sensible of the goodness of 
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition, 
with all its hardships and misfortunes. Ana this part also I 
cannot but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt in 
their misery to say, " Is any affliction like mine V* Let thfiTsv 



80 UFE AND ADVBNTUBB8 

consider how much worse the cases of some people are^ and what 
their case might have heen, if Providence had thought fit. 

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to 
resignation to the will of God in the present disposition of my 
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condi- 
tion ; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to com- 
plain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins ; that I 
enjoyed so many mercies, which I bad no reason to have ex- 
pected in tbat place ; that I ought never more to repine at my 
condition, but to rejoice and to give daily thanks for that daily 
bread which nothing but a cloud of wonders could have brought ; 
that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a miracle, even 
as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens ; nay, by a long series 
of miracles ; and that I coul^ hardly have named a place in the 
uninhabited part of the world where I could have been cast more 
to my advantage, — a place where, as I had no society, which was 
my affliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous beasts, no 
furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life ; no venomous crea- 
tures, or poisonous, which I might have fed on to my hurt ; no 
savages to murder and devour me. 

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was 
a life of mercy anotiber ; and I wanted nothing to make it a life 
of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of God's goodness 
to me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily consola- 
tion ; and after I did make a just improvement of these things, 
I was no more sad. 

I had now been here so long, that many things which I 
brought on shore for my help were either quite gone, or very 
much wasted, and near spent. 

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but 
a very little, which I eked out with water a little and a little, till 
it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the 
paper. 

The next thinff to my ink's being wasted, was that of my 
bread, I mean the hiscuit which I brought out of the ship. This 
I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake 
of bread a day, for above a year : and yet I was quite without 
bread for near a year before I got any com of my own ; and great 
reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it 
being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous. 

My clothes too began to diminish : as to linen, I had had none 
for a good while, except some chequered shirts which I found in 
the chests of the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved, 
because many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt ; 
and it was a very great help to me that I had, among all the 
men's clothes of the ship, almost three dozen of shirts. There 
were also several watchcoats of the seamen's, but they were too 
thick to wear; and though it is true that the weather was so 



CH. Ill, OF BOBINSON CBUSOB* 81 

hot that there was no need of clothes^ yet I could not go quite 
naked. 

Under these circumstances I began to consider about putting 
the few rags I bad, which I called clothes, into some order : I had 
worn out all my waistcoats, and my business was now to try if I 
could not make jackets out of the great watchcoats before men- 
tioned, and with such other materials as I had ; so I set to work 
•a-tailoring, or rather indeed a- botching, for I made most pite- 
ous work of it. However, I contrived to make two or three 
waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great while ; as for 
breeches or drawers, 1 made but a very sorry shift indeed, till 
afterwards. 

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the four- 
footed creatures that I killed, and I had hung them up stretched 
out with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were 
so dry and hard that they were fit for little; but others, it 
«eems, were very useful. The first thing I made of these was a 
great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside to shoot off 
file rain ; and this I performed so well, that after this I made a 
suit of clothes wholly of these skins ; that is to say, a waistcoat, and 
breeches open at the knees, and both loose ; for they were rather 
wanted to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not omit 
to acknowledge, that they were wretchedly made ; for if I was a 
bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor : however, they were such as 
I made very good shift with ; and when I was abroad, if it hap- 
pened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being outmost, I 
was kept very dry. 

After this I spent a deal of time and pains to make me an um- 
brella, of which indeed I was in great want. I had seen them made 
in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the great heats which 
are there ; and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater 
too, being nearer the equinox ; besides, as I was obliged to be much 
abroad^ it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the 
h( ats. I took a world of pains at it, and^was a great while before I 
could make any thing likely to hold. After! thought I had hit 
the way, I spoiled two or three before I succeeded to my mind ; 
but at last I made one that answered indifferently well ; I covered 
it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off the rain like a 
pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk 
out in the hottest of the weather, with greater advantage than I 
could before in the coolest ; and when I had no need of it, I could 
close it, and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived very comfortably, my mind befng composed by 
resignation to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly 
upon the disposal of His providence. This made my life better 
than sociable ; for when I began to regret the want of conversa- 
tion, I would ask myself, whether thus conversing mutually with 
my own thoughts, and, as I hope I may say, with even God Him- 



82 LIFE AND ADVBNTURB8 

self, by ejaculations, was not better than the utmost enjoyment of 
human society in the world ? 

I cannot say that, after this, for five years any extraordinary 
thing happened to me ; but I lived on in the same course, in the 
same manner and place just as before : the chief thing I was em- 
ployed in, — besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and 
rice, and curing my raisins (of both which I always kept up 
just enough to have sufficient stock for the year's provisions be- 
forehand), and my daily labour of going out with my gun, — was 
that of making me a canoe, which at last I finished ; so that 
by digging a canal to it, six feet wide, and four deep, I brought 
it into the creek, almost half a mile. As for the first, that was so 
vastly large, as I made it without considering beforehand, as I 
ought to do, how I should be able to launch it ; so never being 
able to bring it to the water, or bring the water to it, I was ob- 
liged to let it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach me to 
be wiser next time. Indeed the next time, thoueh I could not find 
a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not get the 
water to it, at any less distance than, as I have said, of near half 
a mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it 
over ; and though I was near two years about it, yet I never 
grudged my labour, in hopes of having a boat to go ofi* to sea at 
last. 

However, though my little canoe was finished, yet the size of 
it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when 
I made the first; I mean of venturing over to the terra firma, 
which was above forty miles ofi"; accordingly, the smallness of 
my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and now I thought 
no more of it. But as I had a boat, my next design was to sail 
round the island ; for as I had been on the other side, in one place, 
crossing, as I have already described it, over the land, so the dis- 
coveries I made in that journey made me very eager to see other 
parts of the coast. 

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with discre- 
tion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and 
made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails, which 
lay in store, and of which I had a great quantity by me. 

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found 
she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers and boxes 
at each end of her, to put provisions, necessaries, and ammunition, 
&c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray of the sea ; 
and a little long hollow place I cut in her inside, where I could 
lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep it dry. 

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to 
stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun ofi'me, like an 
awning ; and thus I every now and then made a little excursion 
upon the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little creek ; 
but at last, being eager to view the circumference of ray little 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 83 

kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accordingly I victualled 
my ship for the voyage ; putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes 
I should rather call them) of barley «bread, an earthen pot full of 
parched rice (a food I eat a great deal of), a little bottle of rum, 
naif a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two of 
the large watchcoats which I had saved out of the seamen's 
chests, — these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover 
me in the night. 

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign, 
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage, 
and I found it much longer than I expected ; for though the 
island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east side 
of it, I found a great ledge ot rocks lie out about two leagues into 
the sea, some above water, some under it, and beyond this a shoal 
of sand, lying dry, half a league more ; so that I was obliged to 
go a great way out to sea to double that point. 

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my 
enterprise, and come back again, not knowing how far they might 
oblige me to go out to sea, and above all, doubting how I should 

fet back again ; so I came to an anchor, for I had made me a 
ind of an anchor with a piece of broken grappling which I got 
out of the ship. 

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, 
climbing up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where I 
saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture. 

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived 
a strong, and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, 
and even came close to the point ; and I took the more notice of 
it, because I saw there might he some danger that, when I came 
into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength of it, and «ot 
be able to make the island again. Ana, indeed, had I not got first 
upon this hill, I believe it would have been so ; for there was the 
same current on the other side of the island, only that it set it off 
at a farther distance ; and I saw there was a strong eddy under the 
shore ; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first current, 
and I should presently be in an eddy. 

I lay here, however, two days; because the wind blowing 
pretty fresh (e. at s.e. and that being just contrary to the said 
current) made a great breach of the sea upon the point ; so that 
it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the 
breach, nor to go too far off because of the stream. 

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated over 
night, the sea was calm, and I ventured ; but I am a warning 
again to all rash and ignorant pilots ; for no sooner was I come 
to the point, when I was not my boat's length from the shore, 
than I found myself in a great depth of water, and a current like 
the sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with it with 
such violence, that all my efforts cotdd not keep her so much aa 



84 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

on the edge of it ; but I found it hurried me farther and farther 
out from the eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no 
wind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with my paddles 
signified nothing : and now I began to give myself over for lost ; 
for, as the current was on both sides the island, I knew in a few 
leagues distance they must join again, and then I was irrecover- 
ably gone; nor did t see any possibility of avoiding it: so that I 
hacf no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea, for 
that was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I had indeed 
found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and 
had tossed it into the boat, and I had a great jar of fresh water^ 
that is to say, one of my earthen pots ; but what was all this to 
being driven into the vast ocean, where there was no shore, no 
mainland, or island, for a thousand leagues at least ? 

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to 
make the most miserable condition that .mankind could be in 
worse. Now I looked back upon my desolate solitary island as 
the most pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness my 
heart could wish for, was to be there again. I stretched out my 
hands to it with eager wishes : *'0 happy desert,'' said I, " I shall 
never see thee more I O miserable creature !" said I, "whither am I 
going?" Then I reproached myself with nay unthankful temper, 
and how I had repined at my solitary condition ; and now what 
would I give to be on shore there again ! Thus we never see the true 
state of our condition till it is illustrated to us by its contraries ; 
nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It 
is scarce possible to ima^ne the consternation I was now in, being 
driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to 
be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost 
despair of ever recovering it again. However, I worked hard, till 
my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much to 
the northward, that is, towards the side of the current which the 
eddy lay on, as possibly I could ; when, about noon, as the sun 
passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my 
face, springing up from the s.s.e. This cheered my heart a little, 
and especiSly when, in about half an hour more, it blew a pretty 
small gentle gale. By this time I had got to a frightful distance 
from the island ; and, had the least cloud or hazy weather inter- 
vened, I had been undone another way ; for I had no compass on 
board, and should never have known how to have steered towards 
the island, if I had but once lost sight of it ; but the weather con- 
tinuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and 
spread my sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, 
to get out of the current. 

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to 
stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness of the water, that some 
alteration of the current was near ; for where the current was so 
strong, the water was foul ; but perceiving the water clear, I found 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE* 85 

the current abate ; and presently I found to the east, at about half 
a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks ; these rocks I found 
caused the current to part again ; and as the main stress of it ran 
away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the north-east, so the 
other returned by the repulse of the rock, and made a strong 
eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with a very sharp 
stream. 

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them 
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to mur- 
der them, or who have been in such-like extremities, may guess 
what my present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put my 
boat into the stream of this eddy ; and the wind also freshening, 
how gladly I spread my sail to it. 

This tide, or eddy, carried me about a league in my way back 
again directly towards the island, but about two leagues more 
towards the northward than the current lay, which carried me 
away at first ; so that when I came near the island, I found my- 
self open to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end 
of the island, opposite to that which I went out from. 

When I had made something more than a league of way by 
the help of this current, I found it was spent, and served me no 
farther. However, I found, that being between the two great 
currents (viz. that on the south side, which had hurried me away, 
and that on the north, which lay about two leagues on the other 
side), in the west of the island, I found the water at least still, 
and running no wa^' ; and having still a breeze of wind fair for 
me, I kept on steermg directly for the island, though not ms^ing 
such fresh way as I did before. 

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about a 
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which occa- 
sioned this distance, stretching out to the southward, and casting 
off the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy 
to the north ; and this I found very strong, but not directly set- 
ting the way my course lay, which was due west, but almost full 
north. However, having a fresh gale, I stretched across this 
eddy, slanting north-west, and in about an hour came within 
about a mile of the shore : it being smooth water, I soon got to 
land. 

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave God 
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lajr aside all thoughts of 
my deliverance by my boat ; and refreshing myself with such 
things as I had, I brought my boat close to tne shore, in a little 
cove that I had espied under some trees, and laid me down to 
sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the 
voyage. 

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my 
boat. 1 had run too much hazard to think of attempting it by the 
way I went out ] and what might be at the other side (I mean 

I 



86 LIFB AND ADVEyrUBES 

the west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more 
risks ; so I only resolved in the morning to make my way west- 
ward, along the shore, and to see if there was no creek where I 
might lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I 
wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coasting the 
shore, I came to a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, 
which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet, or brook, 
where I found a convenient harbour for mv boat, and where she 
lay as if she had been in a little dock macie on purpose for her : 
here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on 
shore to look about me, and see where I was. 

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had 
been before, when I travelled on foot to that shore ; so taking 
nothing out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella (for it was 
exceedingly hot), I began my march : the way was comfortable 
enough after such a voyage as I had had, and I reached my old 
bower in the evening, where I found every thing standing as I left it. 

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my 
limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep : but judge you, if you 
can, what a surprise I must have been in, when I was awoke out 
of my sleep by a voice calling me by my name several times, 
" Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe ! Where are 
you, Robin Crusoe ? Where are you ? Where have you been V 

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or 
paddling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and walking the 
latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly ; and dozing between 
sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to 
me : but as the voice continued to repeat ** Robin Crusoe, Robin 
Crusoe," at last I began to awake more perfectly, and was at first 
dreadfully frightened, and started up in the utmost consternation : 
but no sooner were my eyes open, than I saw my Poll sitting on 
the top of the hedge, and immediately knew that this was he that 
spoke to me ; for just in such bemoaning language I had used to 
talk to him, and teach him ; and he had learned it so perfectly, 
that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my 
face, and cry, " Poor Robin Crusoe, Where are you ? Where 
have you been ? How came you here ?" — and such things as I 
had taught him. 

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and 
had enough to do for many days to sit still, and reflect upon the 
danger I had been in. I was very well contented to be without 
any boat, though it had been the product of so many months' 
labour to make it, and of so many more to get it into the sea. In 
this frame of mind I remained near a year, lived a very sedate 
retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being 
very much composed, as to my condition, and fully comforted in 
resigning myself to the dispensations of Providence, I thought I 
lived really very happily in all things except that of society. 



CH. III. OF BOBINSON CRUSOB. 87 

I improved myself, in this time, in all the mechanic exercises 
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to ; and I 
believe could, upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter, 
especiallv considering how few tools I had. 

Besioes this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my 
earthenware, and contrived well enough to make them with a 
wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better, because I made 
things round and shapely, which before were ugly thin^ indeed 
to look upon. But I think I never was more proud ot my own 
performance, or more joyful for any thing I found out, than for 
my being able to make a tobacco-pipe ; and though it was a very 
clumsy uiing, and only burnt red like other earthenware, yet as 
it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was exceed- 
ingly comforted with it; for I had been always used to smoke, 
thouffh when I searched the ship, I could not come at any pipes 
at all. 

In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made abund- 
ance of baskets, as well as my inventions shewed me, which, 
though not very handsome, yet were convenient for laying things 
up, or fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a goat, 
I could hang it up in a tree, fiay it, dress it, cut it in pieces, and 
bring it home in a basket : and the like, by a turtle ; I could cut 
it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the fiesh, which 
was enough for me, and bring them home in a basket, and leave 
the rest behind me ; also, large deep baskets were my receivers 
for my com, which I always rubbed out as soon as it was dry, 
and cured ; and kept it in great baskets, instead of a granary. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably ; and 
this was a want, which it was impossible for me to supply ; on 
which, £ began seriously to consider what I must do when I 
should have no more; that is to say, how I should do to kill 
any goats. 

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I 
have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study 
some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not 
catch some of them alive. 

To this purpose I made snares to hamper them ; and believe 
they were more than once taken in them ; but my tackle was 
not good, for I had no wire, and I always found them broken, 
and my bait devoured. 

At length I resolved to try a pit-fall ; so I dug several large 
pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats used 
to feed, and over these pits I placed hurdles of my own making, 
with a great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears of 
barley and dry rice, without setting the trap ; and I could easily 
perceive that the goats had gone in, and eaten up the corn, for I 
could see the mark of their feet ; at length, I set three traps in one 
night, and going the next morning, I found them all standing, 



88 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

• 

and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging : 
however, I altered my traps; and going one morning to see them, 
J found in one an old he-goat ', and in another, three kids, a male 
and two females. 

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him ; he was 
80 fierce I durst not go into the pit to him, to bring him away 
alive, which was what I wanted : I could have killed him, but 
that would not have answered my end ; so I e'en let him out, and 
he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits. But I 
did not then know what I afterwards learned, that hunger would 
tame a lion ; if I had let him stay there three or four days with- 
out food, and then have carried him some water to drink, and a 
little corn, he would have been as tame as one of the kids; for 
they are sagacious, tractable creatures, when they are well used. 

However, for the present I iet him go, knowing no better at 
that time ; then I went to the three kids ; and taking them one 
by one, I tied them with strings together ; and with some diffi- 
culty brought them all home. 

It was a good while before they would feed ; but throwing 
them some sweet com, it tempted them, and they began to be 
tame ; and now I found that if I expected to supply myself with 
goat's-fiesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some 
up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have them 
about my house like a flock of sheep. 

But then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep the 
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when 
they ffrew up ; and the only way for this was to have some en- 
closed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to 
keep tnem in so effectually that those within might not break 
out, or those without break in. 

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands ; yet as I 
saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first endeavour 
was to find out a proper piece of ground ; viz. where there was 
likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink^ 
and cover to keep them from the sun. 

Those who understand such enclosures, will think I had very 
little contrivance, when I shall tell them, that, having pitched 
upon a place very proper for all these (namely, a plain open 
piece of meadow-land, which had two or three little rills of 
fresh water in it), I began my enclosing this space of ground in 
such a njanner, that my hedge, or pale, must nave been at least 
two miles round ; nor was the madness of it so great as to the 
compass ; for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time 
enough to do it in ; but I did not consider that my goats would 
be as wild in so much compass, as if they had had the whole 
island ; and I should have so much room to chase them in, that 
I should never catch them. 

My hedge was begun, and carried on, I believe, about fifty 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 89 

yards, when tbis thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped 
shorty and for the first beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of 
about 150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth, which, as 
it would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable 
time, so, as my fiock increased, I could add more ground to my 
enclosure. 

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with 
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece ; 
and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part 
of it, and accustomed them to feed as near me as possible, to make 
them familiar ; and very often I would go and carry them some 
ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my 
hand ; so that after my enclosure was finished, and I let them 
loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me, for 
a handful of corn. 

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had 
a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all ; and in two years 
more, I had three-and-forty, besides several that I took and 
killed for my food ; and after that I enclosed five several pieces 
of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, 
to take them as I wanted them ; and gates out of one piece of 
ground into another. 

But this was not all ; for now I not only had goat's-flesh to 
feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thin^ which indeed, in 
the beginning of my exile, I did not so much as think of, and 
which, when it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable 
surprise ; for now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon 
or two of milk in a day. And as nature, who gives supplies of 
food to every creature, dictates even, naturally how to make use 
of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen 
butter or cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a 
great many essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and 
cheese at last, and never wanted them afterwards. 

How mercifully can our great Creator treat His creatures, 
even in those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed 
in destruction ! How can He sweeten the bitterest providences, 
and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons and prisons! 
What a table was here spread for me 'in a wilderness, where I 
saw nothing at first, but to perish for hunger ! 

It would have made a Stoic smile, to have seen me and my 
little family sit down to dinner: there was my majesty, the prince 
and lord of the whole island ; I had the lives of all my subjects 
at absolute command ; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take 
it away ; and no rebels among all my subjects ! 

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended 
by my servants ! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the 
only person permitted to talk to me; my dog, who was now 
grown old and crazy, sat always at my right ha.ivd\ ^\id\.^H^ ^i»^s»^

90 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

one on one side the table, and one on the other^ expectmg now 
and then a bit from my hand^ as a mark of special favour. 

I was rather impatient, as I have observed, to have the use 
of my boat, though very loath to run any more hazard ; and there- 
fore, sometimes 1 sat contriving ways to get her about the island, 
and at other times I sat myself down contented enough without 
her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go down to 
the point of the island, where, as I have said in my last ramble, 
I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current 
set, that I might see what I had to do : this inclination increased 
upon me every day ; and at length I resolved to travel thither by 
land, and following the edge of the shore, I did so. But had any 
one in England been to meet such a man as I was, it must either 
have frightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter ; and as 
I frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at 
the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an equip- 
age, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a sketch of my 
figure, as follows : 

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's-skin, with a 
fiap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as 
to shoot the rain off from running into my neck ; nothing being 
so hurtful in these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the 
clothes. 

I had a short jacket of goat's-skin, the skirts coming down 
to about the middle of mv thighs, and a pair of open-kneed 
breeches of the same: the oreeches were made of the skin of an 
old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side, 
that, like pantaloon?, it reached to the middle of my legs. 
Stockings and shoes I had none ; but I made me a pair of some- 
thing, I scarce know what to call them, like buskins, to flap 
over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes, but 
of a most barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my 
clothes. 

I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which I drew to- 
gether with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles ; and in a 
kind of loop on either side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, 
hung a little saw and hatchet, — one on one side, one on the 
other. I had another belt, not so broad, and fastened in the 
same manner, which hung over my shoulder ; and at the end of 
it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's- 
skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the other my 
shot ; at my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, 
and over my head a great clumsy uorly goat^s-skin umbrella, but 
which, after all, was the most necessary thing I had about me, 
next to my gun : as for my face, the colour of it was really not 
so Mulatto-like as one might expect from a man not at all care- 
ful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. 
My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter 



ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 91 

of a yard long ; but as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, 
I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper L'p, 
which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, 
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I saw at Sallee ; 
for the Moors did not wear such, though the Turks did. Of 
these mustachios or whiskers, I will not say they were lon^ 
enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of length 
and shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would 
have passed for frightful. 

In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out 
live or six days. I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to 
the place where I first brought my boat to an anchor to ^et up 
upon the rocks ; and, having no boat now to take care of, I went 
over the land a nearer way to the same height that I was upon 
before ; when lookinff forward to the point of the rock which 
lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as I 
said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet ; 
no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there than in other 
places. 

I was at a loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some 
time in the observing of it, to see if nothing from the sets of the 
tide had occasioned it ; but I was presently convinced how it 
was, viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining 
with the current of waters from some great river on the shore, 
must be the occasion of this current ; and that, according as the 
wind blew more forcibly from the west or from the north, this 
current came nearer or went farther from the shore ; for, waiting 
thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then 
the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as 
before, only that it ran farther ofl^, being near half a league from 
the shore ; whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and 
hurried me and my canoe along with it, which at another time it 
would not have done. 

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but 
to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might 
very easily bring my boat about the island again : but when I 
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror at 
the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that I could not 
think of it again with any patience ; but, on the contrary, I took 
another resolution, which was more safe, though more laborious ; 
and this was. that 1 would make another canoe, and so have 
one for one side of the island, and one for the other. 

I had now two plantations in the island :one my little forti- 
fication or tent, with the wall about it under the rock, with the 
cave behind me, which by this time I had enlarged into several 
apartment<4 or caves, one within another. One of these, which 
was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my wall 
or fortification, that is to say, beyond where my wall ^Qvaa^ \a 



92 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

the rock, was all filled up with large earthen pots, of which I 
have given an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great haskets, 
which would hold five or six hushels each, where I laid up my 
stores of provision, especially my corn, some in the ear, cut 
off short from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my 
hands. 

As for my wall, made with long stakes or piles, those piles 
grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and 
spread so very much, that there was not the least appearance, 
to any one's view, of any habitation behind them. 

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the 
land, and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-ground, 
which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded 
me their harvest in its season ; and whenever I had occasion for 
more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that. 

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a toler- 
able plantation there also ; for, first, I had my little bower, 
which I kept in repair ; ue. 1 kept the hedge which circled it 
in constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing 
always in the inside : I kept the trees (which at first were no 
more than stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall) 
always so cut, that they might spread and grow thick and wild, 
and make the more agreeable shade, which they did effectually. 
In the middle of this I had my tent always standing, being a 
piece of a sail spread over poles set up for that purpose, and 
which never wanted any repair or renewing ; and under this I 
had made me a couch with the skins of the creatures I had 
killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on them, 
such as belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved, and 
a great watchcoat to cover me ; and here, whenever I had 
occasion to be absent from my chief seat, I took up my country 
habitation. 

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle ; that is 
to say, my goats : and as I had taken immense pains to fence 
and enclose this ground, I was so anxious to see it kept entire, 
lest the goats should break through, that 1 never left off till, with 
infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of 
small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather a pale 
than a hedge, and there was scarcely room to put a hand through 
between them, which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they 
all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure stronger than 
any wall. 

This will shew that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains 
to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable 
support ; for I considered that keeping up a breed of tame crea- 
tures thus at my hand, would be a living magazine of fiesh, milk, 
butter, and cheese for me as long as I lived in the place ; and 
that keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my per- 



CH. m. OF ROBINSON CRD SOB. 93 

fectiog my endosaTes to sach a degree that I might be sure of 
holding them together. 

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I prinei- 
pally depended on for my winter store of raisms, and vrhich I 
never failed to preserve very carefully, as the best and most 
agreeable dainty of my whole diet ; and, indeed, thev were not 
only agreeable^ but medicinal^ wholesome^ and nourisiiing to the 
last d^ree. 

As this was also about halfway between my other habitation 
and the place where I had laid up uiy boat, I generally staveil and 
slept here in my wnj thither ; for I used frequently to visit my 
boat, and kept all things about or belonging to herein very good 
order : sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but no more 
hazardous voyages would I eo, nor scarcely ever above a stone's 
cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of being bur* 
ried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any 
other accident. But now I come to a new scene of my life.

CH. IV. ADVENTTJRBS OF ROBINSON C&U80B. 95 

I had no sleep that night : the farther I was from the occa- 
aon of my fright, the greater my apprehensions were ; which is 
something contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to 
the usual practice of all creatures in fear. Sut I was so embar- 
rassed with m^ own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed 
nothing but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was 
now a great way oft it. Sometimes 1 fancied it must be the 
devil ;^ and reason joined in with me upon this supposition. 
For how should any other thing in human shape come into the 
place ? Where was the vessel that brought them ? What marks 
were there of any other footsteps ? And how was it possible a 
man should come there ? But, then, to think that Satan should 
I take human shape upon him in such a place, where there could 
i be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot 
behind him, and that even for no purpose too (for he could not 
be sure I should see it), this was an amazement the other way. 
I considered that the devil might have found out abundance of 
other ways to have terrified me than this of the single print of a 
foot. That as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he 
would never have been so simple to leave a mark in a place 
where it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it 
or not ; and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon 
a high wind would have defaced entirely. All this seemed in- 
consistent with the thing itself, and with all notions we usually 
I entertain of the subtlety of the devil. 

> Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of 

j all apprehensions of its being the devil. And I presently con- 
t eluded that it must be some more dangerous creature, viz. that 
it must be some of the savages of the mainland over against me, 
I who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and either driven 
! by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the island ; and 
i had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being as 
I loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as I should 
have been to have had them. 

While these reflections were passing in my mind, I was very 
thankful that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that 
time, and that they did not see my boat, by which they would 
have concluded that some inhabitants had been in the place, and 
perhaps have searched farther for me. Then terrible thoughts 
racked my imagination about their having found mv boat, and 
that there were people here ; and that if so, I should certainly 
have them come again in greater numbers and devour me ; that 
if it should happen that they should not find me, yet they would 
discover my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry away all my 
flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want. 

> It will be remembered, that the frequent appearance of Satan in a 
bodily shape on the earth was a leading article of tne popular creed at the 
time when the above was written. — £d.

96 LIFE AND ADVSNTURBS 

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope : all that former 
confidence in God, which was founded upon such wonderful ex- 
perience as I had had of His goodness, now vanished, as if He 
that had fed me hitherto could not preserve by His power the 
provision which He had made for me by His goodness. I re- 
proached myself with my easiness, that would not sow any more 
corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if 
no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that 
was upon the ground. And this I thought so just a reproof, that 
I resolved for the future to have two or three years' com before- 
hand, to that whatever might come, I might not perish for want 
of bread. 

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of 
man ! And by what secret differing springs are the affections 
hurried about as differing circumstances present ! To-day we 
love what to-morrow we hate ; to-day we seek what to-morrow 
we shun ; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear, nay even 
tremble at the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me at 
this time in the most lively manner imaginable ; for I, whose 
only afiiiction was, that I seemed banished from human society ; 
that to have seen one of my own species would have seemed to 
me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that 
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could 
bestow ; I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehen- 
sions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at 
but the shadow or silent appearance of a man's having set his foot 
on the island ! 

I then reflected that God, Who was not only righteous but 
omnipotent, as He had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, 
so He was able to deliver me ; that if He did not think fit to do 
it, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and 
entirely to His will. And, on the other hand, it was my duty 
also to hope in Him, pray to Him, and quietly to attend the dic- 
tates and directions of His daily providence. 

These thoughts occupied me many hours, days, nay, I may 
say weeks and months ; and one particular effect of my cogita- 
tions on this occasion I cannot omit, namely, one morning early, 
lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from 
the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed me very much, 
upon which those words of the Scripture came into my thoughts, 
"Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, 
and thou shalt glorify Me." 

Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was 
not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray 
earnestly to God for deliverance. When I had done praying, I 
took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words that 
presented to me were, " Wait on the Lord, and be of good 
cheer, and He shall strengthen thy heart: wait; I say, on the 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 97 

Loud." It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me ; 
and in return, I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more 
sad ; at least, not on that occasion. 

In the midst of these cogitations and apprehensions, it came 
into my thoughts one day, that all this might be a chimera of 
my own ; that this print might be the print of my own foot, 
when I came on shore from my boat. This cheered me up a 
little, but I could not persuade myself fully of it, until I should 
go down to the shore, and see the print again, and measure it by 
my own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I 
might be assured it was my own foot. But when I came to the 
place ; first, it appeared evident to me, that when I laid up my 
boat, I could not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts ; 
secondly, when I came to measure the mark with my own foot, 
I found my foot not so large by a great deal. Both these things 
filled my head with new imaginations, and terrified me again to 
the highest degree ; so that I shook with cold, like one in an 
ague, and I went home again, filled with the belief that some 
man or men had been on shore there; or, in short, that the 
island was inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was 
aware ; and what course to take for my security, I knew not. 

Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take, when possessed with 
fear ! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason 
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was, 
to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild 
into the woods, that the enemy mi^ht not find them, and then 
frequent the island in prospect of the same, or the like booty ; 
then to dig up my two corn-fields, that they might not find a 
grain there, and be prompted to frequent the island; then to 
demolish my bower and tent, that they might not see any vestiges 
of my habitation, and be prompted to look further, in order to 
find out the persons inhabiting. 

These were the subjects of the first night's cogitation, after 
I had come home again, while the apprehensions which had so 
over-run my mind were fresh upon me. Thus fear of danger 
is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself when 
apparent to the eyes ; and we find the burden of anxiety greater 
by much than the evil which we are anxious about. But, what 
was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this trouble, from 
the resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, 
I thought, like Saul, who complained not only that the Philistines 
were upon him, but that God had forsaken him ; for I did not 
now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my 
distress, and resting upon His providence, as I had done before, 
for my defence and deliverance. 

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night; but 
in the morning I fell asleep, through sheer exhaustion ; and after 
sleeping very soundly, I awoke much better composed than I had 



98 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

ever been before. And now I began to think sedately ; and, 
upon debate with myself, I concluded, that this island, which 
was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the 
mainland than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned as 
I might imagine ; that although there were no inhabitants who 
lived on the spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats 
off from the shore, who either with design, or when they were 
driven by cross winds, might come to this place. 

That I had lived here hfteen years now, and had not met with 
the least shadow or fi^re of any people before ; and that, if at 
any time they should be driven here, it was probable they went 
away again as soon as they could, seeing they had never tnought 
fit to fix there, upon any occasion, to this time. 

That the most I could suggest any danger from was, from 
any such casual accidental landing of straggling people from the 
main; and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider 
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon 
the spot. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large 
as to carry a door throuj^h again, which door, as I said, came 
out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock. Upon 
maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw a second 
fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance from 
my wall, just where I had planted a double row of trees about 
twelve years before ; these trees having been planted so thick 
before, there needed but a few piles to be driven between them, 
that they should be thicker and stronger, and my wall would be 
soon finished. 

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was 
thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and every thing I 
could think of to make it strong ; having in it seven little holes, 
about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of this 
I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bringing 
earth out of mv cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and 
walking upon it ; and through the seven holes I contrived to 
plant the muskets (of which I mentioned that I got seven on 
shore out of the ship) ; and fitted them into frames that held them 
like a carriage, that so I could fire all the seven guns in two 
minutes time. This wall I was many a weary month in finishing ; 
and yet I never thought myself safe till it w&s done. 

When this was accomplished, I stuck all the ground without 
my wall, for a great length every way, as full with stakes or sticks 
of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they 
could well stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near 
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large space between 
them and my wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and 
they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they at- 
tempted to approach my outer wall. 



CH. IV. OP ROBINSON CBUSOE. 99 

Thus in two-years time I had a thick grove; and in ^ve or 
six-years time I had a wood before my dwelling, grown so thick 
and strong, that it was, indeed, perfectly impassable; and no 
man, of what kind soever, would ever imagine that there 'was 
any thing beyond it, much less a habitation. As for the way 
I proposed myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue), it was 
by setting two' ladders ; one to a part of the rock which was 
low, and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder 
upon that : so when the two ladders were taken down, no man 
living could come down to me without injuring himself; and if 
they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer 
wall. 

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest 
for my own preservation ; and it will be seen at length, that &ey 
were not altogether without just reason. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my 
other affairs ; for I was greatly concerned for my little herd of 
goats; they were not only aj)resent supply to me upon every 
occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, without the expense 
of powder and shot, but also lessened the fatigue of my hunting 
after the wild ones; and I was loath to lose the advantage of 
them, and to have them all to nurse up over again. 

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think but 
of two ways to preserve them ; one was, to find another conve- 
nient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them into it 
every night ; and the other was, to enclose two or three little bits 
of land, remote from one another, and as much concealed as I 
could, where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in 
each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in 
general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble 
and time. And this, though it would rer}uire a great deal of time 
and labour, I thought was the more rational deiiffn. 

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired 
parts of the island ; and I pitched upon one which was as private 
indeed as my heart could wish ; for it wai a little damp piece of 
ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is 
observed, I almost lost myself onoa before, endeavouring to come 
back that way from the eastern )mrt of the island. Here 1 found 
a clear piece of land, near three uereii, no surrounded with woods 
that it was almost an enclosure hy nature ; at least it did not 
want near so much labour to nmkt) It so, as the other pieces of 
ground I had worked so hard at, 

I immediately went to work with this spot of ground, and in 
less than a month's time I had ho fttuced it round, that mv flock 
or herd, which were not so wild now as ut first they might be sup- 
posed to be, were well enough si^ured in it. So without an^ 
farther delay, I removed ten sho-gonts and two he-goats to this 
])lace ; and when there, I continuod to perfect the fence^ till I had 



100 LIF£ AND ADVEMTUBES 

made it as secure as the other, which, however, as I did it at 
more leisure, took me up more time by a great deal. 

After I had thus secured one part of my little living stock, I 
went about the whole island, searching for another private place to 
make such another deposit ; when, wandering more to the west 
point than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought 
X saw a boat at a great distance. It was so remote, that I could 
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes 
were not able to look any longer ; but as I descended from the 
hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved 
to go no more without a perspective glass in my pocket. 

When I was come down the hilT, to the end of the island, 
where, indeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced 
that the seeing the print of a man's foot was not such a strange 
thing in the island as I imagined. I was perfectly confounded 
and amazed, nor is it possible for me to express the horror of my 
mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and 
other bones of human bodies ; and particularly I observed a place 
where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth, 
where it is to be supposed some savage wretches had sat down to 
their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures. 

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I enter- 
tained no notions of any danger to myself from it for a long 
while ; all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such 
a pitch of inhuman brutality, which, though I had often heard 
of, yet I never had so near a view of before. In short, I turned 
away my face from the horrid spectacle, my stomach grew sick, 
and I could not bear to stay in the place a moment ; so I got 
up the hill again with all the sjieed I could, and walked on to- 
wards my own habitation. 

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood 
still awhile as amazed ; and then, recovering myself, I looked up 
with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a, flood of tears in 
my eyes, gave God thanks that He had cast my first lot in a part 
of the world where I was separated from such dreadful creatures 
as these ; and that though I had esteemed my present condition 
very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it, that 
I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of ; and this 
above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been com- 
forted with the knowledge of Himself, arid the hope of His bless- 
ing, which was a felicity more than equivalent to all the misery 
which I had suffered or could suffer. 

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and 
began to be much easier now as to the safety of my circumstances 
than ever I was before ; for I observed that these wretches never 
came to this island in search of what they could get ; perhaps 
not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting any thing here ; and 
having often, no doubt, been up in the covered woody part of it. 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRVSOB. 101 

without finding any thing to their purpose. I knew I had been 
here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps 
of a human creature there before ; and might be here eighteen 
more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover 
myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do, it being 
my only business to keep myself entirely concealed where I was, 
unless I found a better sort of creatures than cannibals to make 
myself known to. 

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches 
I have been speaking of, and of the inhuman custom of their 
devouring one another, that I continued pensive and sad, and 
kept close within my own circle for almost two years after this, 
by which I mean my three plantations, viz. my castle, my bower, 
and my enclosure in the woods ; nor did I look after this for any 
other use than as an enclosure for my goats ; for the aversion 
which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such that 
I was as fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself. 
Nor did I so much as go to look after my boat in all this time, 
but began rather to think of making another, for I could not 
think of ever making any more attempts to bring the other boat 
round the island, lest I should meet with some of those creatures 
at ^ sea, for if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, 
I knew what would have been my lot. 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no 
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off my 
uneasiness about them, and 1 began to live in the same composed 
manner as formerly ; only with this difference, that I used more 
caution, and kept my eyes more about me, than I did before, 
lest I should happen to be seen. And, particularly, I was more 
cautious of firing my gun, lest any one being on the island should 
happen to hear it ; and it was therefore a very good providence to 
me that I had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats, that I 
bad no need to hunt any more about the woods or shoot at them. 
And if I did catch any more of them after this, it was with traps and 
snares ; so that for two years after this I believe I never fired my 
gun once off, though I never went out without it ; and, what was 
more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always carried 
them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my goat- 
skin belt. I likewise furbished up one of the great cutlasses that I 
had out of the ship, and made a belt to put it in also. So that 
I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went abroad, 
if you add to the former description of myself the particular of 
two pistols and a great broad-sword hanging at my side. 

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, 
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate 
way of living. All these things tended to shew me more and 
more how far my condition was from being miserable, compared 
to many others, which it might have pleased God to have made 

k2 



102 LIFE AND ADVENTURKS 

my lot. It put me upon reflecting how little repining there 
would be among mankind, at any condition of life, if people would 
rather compare their condition with those that are worse, in order 
to be thankful, than be always comparing it with those which 
are better, to assist their murmurings and complainings. 

And now, night and day, I could think of nothing but how I 
might destroy some of these monsters in their cruel bloody en- 
tertainment, and, if possible, save the victim they should bring 
hither to devour. It would take up a volume to set down all the 
contrivances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my thoughts, 
for the destroying these creatures, or at least frightening them, 
so as to prevent their coming hither any more. But all was in 
vain. Nothing could possibly take effect unless I was to be there 
to do it myself; and what could one man do when perhaps there 
might be twenty or thirty together, with their bows and arrows, 
with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I could with 
my gun ? 

I employed myself several days to find out proper places to 
put myself in ambuscade to watch for the savages. At length I 
found a place in the side of the hill where I was satisfied I might 
securely wait till I saw any of the boats coming, and might then, 
even before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself 
unseen into thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow 
large enough to conceal me entirely. Here I might sit and 
observe all their bloody doings, and take my full aim at their 
heads when they were so close together as that it would be next 
to impossible that I could fail of wounding three or four of them 
at the first shot. 

This place, then, I fixed upon for my design ; and accordingly 
I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The 
two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five 
smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets, and the fowling- 
piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest 
size. I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each ; and 
in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and 
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition. 

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and in my 
imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour every 
morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as 
I called it, about three miles or more, to see if I could observe 
any boats upon the sea coming near the island, or standing over 
towards it. 

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out, so 
long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits 
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for such an exe- 
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence 
which I had not at all entered into a di^ussion of in my thoughts, 
any further than that my passions were at first fired by the horror 



CH. lY. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 103 

1 conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of that country, 
who, it seems, had been suffered by God, in His wise disposition 
of the world, to have no other guide than that of their own defeased 
passions. But now I began to be weary of the excursion which I 
had made so long and so far every morning in vain, and so like- 
wise ray opinion of the action itself began to alter, and I began, with 
cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was going to 
engage in ; what authority or call I had to be judge and execu- 
tioner upon these men, whom Heaven had thougnt fit for so many 
ages to suffer unpunished ; also, how far these people were offenders 
against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that 
blood which they shed promiscuously one upon another. I de- 
bated with myself thus : How do I know what God Himself 
judges in this particular case ? It is certain these people do not 
commit this as a crime ; it is not against their own consciences 
reproving or reproaching them. They do not know it to be an 
offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do 
in almost all the sins we commit. 

When I had considered this a little, it followed that these 
people were not murderers in the sense that I had before con- 
demned them in my thoughts, any more than those Christians 
were murderers who often put to death the prisoners taken in 
battle, or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops 
of men to the sword without giving quarter, though they threw 
down their arms and submitted.^ 

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the usage they 
gave one another was thiis brutish and inhuman, yet it was really 
nothing to me : these people had done me no injury ; that if they 
assailed me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate preservation 
to fall upon them, something might be said for it ; but that I was 
yet out of their power, and they had no knowlege of, and con- 
sequently no design upon me ; and therefore it could not be just 
for me to fall upon them. 

These considerations made me pause, and I began by little 
and little to be off my scheme, and to conclude I nad taken a 
wrong measure in my resolution to attack the savages ; that it 
was not my business to meddle with them unless they first attacked 
me, and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent ; but that, 
if I were discovered and attacked, then I knew my duty. 

On the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the 
way, not to deliver, but rather to ruin and destroy myself ; for un- 
less I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at 
that time, but that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but 
one escaped to tell his countrymen what had happened, they would 
come over again by thousands to revenge the death of their fel- 
lows ; and I should only bring upon myself a certain destruction. 

1 The perpetrators of the wholesale carnage ahoYe alluded to cannot, we think, be 
exempted from the guilt of murder. — Ed. 



104 LIF£ AND ADVENTURES 

Upon tbe whole, I concluded, that neither in principle nor in 
policy, ought I one way or other to concern myself in this affair : 
that^y business was, by all possible means, to conceal myself 
from them, and not to leave the least signal whereby to guess 
that there were any human beings upon tbe island. 

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this : and 
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these 
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to 
see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether 
any of them had been on shore there or not ; that I might not be 
tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be pro- 
voked, by any advantage that might present itself, to fall upon 
them ; only this I did, I went and removed my boat, which I had 
on the other side the island, and carried it doi/vn to the east end of 
the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove which I found 
under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the cur- 
rents, the savages would not come with their boats, upon auy 
account whatsoever. 

With my boat I carried away every thing that I had left there 
belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither ; 
namely, a mast and sail, which I had made for her, and a thing like 
an anchor, but, indeed, which could not be called either anchor 
or grappling : however, it was the best I could make of its kind. 
All these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow of 
any discoverj^ or any appearance of any boat, or of any habita- 
tion upon the island. 

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, 
and seldom went from my cell, other than upon my constant em- 
ployment, namely, to mUk my she-goats, and manage my little 
flock in the wood, which, as it was on the other part of the island, 
was quite out of danger : for certain it is; that these savage people, 
who sometimes haunted this island, never came with any thoughts 
of finding any thing here, and consequently never wandered off 
from the coast ; and I doubt not but they might have been several 
times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me 
cautious, as well as before ; and indeed I looked back with some 
horror upon the thoughts of what my condition would have been, 
if I had chanced upon them, and been discovered naked and un- 
armed, except with one gun, and that loaded often only with 
small shot. I walked everywhere peeping and peering about 
the island to see what I could eet : what a surprise should I have 
been in, if, when I discoverea the print of a man's foot, I had 
instead of that seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them 
pursuing me, without a possibility of my escaping them ! 

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me, 
and distressed my mind so much that I could not soon recover 
it ; to think what I should have done, and how I not only should 
not have been able to resist them, but even should not have had 



CB. IV. OF ROBINSON CBI7S08. 105 

presence of mind enough to do what I might have done ; much 
less what now after so much consideration and preparation I 
might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these 
thin^, I would fall into a melancholy, and sometimes it 
would last a great while ; but at last I resolved it all into 
thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me from so 
many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs 
which I could no way have been the agent in delivering myself 
from. 

I believe the reader will not think it strange, if I confess that 
the anxieties, the constant dangers I lived in, and the concern 
that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all 
the contrivances that I had laid for my future accommodations 
and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more now upon 
my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive a nail, or 
chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I should make 
should be heard ; much less would I fire a gun, for the same 
reason ; and above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making any 
fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the 
day, should betray me : and for this reason I removed that part 
of my business which required fire, su«h as burning of pots and 
pipes, &c. into my new apartment in the woods ; where, after I 
haid been some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, a 
natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way ; and where, 
I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be 
so hardy as to venture in ; nor indeed would any man else, but 
one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat. 

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, 
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see now an 
abundant reason to ascribe all such things to Providence), I was 
cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal ; and 
before I e:o on, I must observe the reason of my making this char- 
coal, which was this : 

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said 
before ; and yet I could not live there without baking my bread, 
cooking my meat, &c., so I contrived to burn some wood here, 
as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark, 
or dry coal ; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal 
to carry home, and perform the other services which fire was 
needed for at home, without danger of smoke. 

But this is by the by. While I was cutting down some wood 
here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brush- 
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I was 
curious to look into it, and getting with difficulty into the mouth 
of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to 
stand upright in, and perhaps another with me ; but I must con- 
fess, I made more haste out than I did in ; for, on looking farther 
into the place (which was perfectly dark), I saw two broad shining 



106 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which 
twinkled like two stars, the dim light from the cave's mouth 
shining directly in and making the reflection. 

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and hegan to 
call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself, that he that was 
afraid to see the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an 
island all alone, and that I might venture to believe there was 
nothing in this cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon 
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a great firebrand, and in I 
rushed, with the stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three 
steps in, when I was almost as much frightened as before ; for 
I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain ; and 
it was followed by a broken noise, as if of words half-expressed, 
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was struck 
with such a surprise that it put me into a cold sweat ; but still, 
plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging 
myself a little by considering that the power and presence of 
God was everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped 
forward again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a 
little over my head, I saw, lying on the ground, an old he-goat, 
just gasping for life, and dying indeed of mere old age. 

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he 
essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I 
thought with myself, he might even lie there ; for if he had 
frightened me so, he would certainly frighten any of the savages, 
if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there while he 
had any life in him. 

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look 
round me, when I found the cave was but very small ; that is to 
say, it might be about twelve feet over, but in no manner of 
shape, either round or square, no hands but those of nature ever 
having been employed in making it. I observed also, that there 
was a place at the farther side of it that went in farther, but was 
so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and knees to 
go into it, and whither it went, I knew not ; so having no candle, 
I gave it over for that time, but resolved to come again the next 
day, provided with candles and a tinder-box. 

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six large 
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now 
of goats' tallow) ; and going into this low place, I was obliged to 
creep upon all fours, almost ten yards; which, by the way, I 
thought was a venture bold enough, considering that 1 knew not 
how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When I was got 
through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe 
near twenty feet ; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the 
island, I dare say, as it was to look round the sides and roof of 
this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred thousand 
lights to me, from my two candles; what it was in the rock^ 



CH. IV. OP ROBINSON CRUSOB. 107 

whether diamonds^ or any other precious stones^ or gold^ I knew 
not. 

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, of 
its kind, though perfectly dark ; the floor was dry and level, and 
had a sort of small loose gravel upon it ; so that there was no 
nauseous or venomous creature to he seen ; neither was there any 
damp or wet on the sides or roof. The only difficulty was the en- 
trance, which, however, as it was a place of security, and such a 
retreat as I wanted, I thought was an advantage ; so that I was 
really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any delay, 
to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about, to 
this place ; particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine 
of powder, and all my spare arras, viz. two fowling-pieces (for I 
had three in all) and three muskets (for of them I had eight in 
all). So I kept at my castle only fiye, which stood ready mounted, 
like pieces of cannon, on my outmost fence, and were ready also 
to take out on any expedition. 

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took oc- 
casion to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of the 
sea, and which bad been wet ; and I found that the water had 
penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on every 
side, which, caking and growing hard, had preserved the inside 
like a kernel in a shell ; so that I had near sixty pounds of very 
good powder in the centre of the cask ; and this was an agreeable 
discovery to me at that time : so I carried all away thither, never 
keeping above two or three pounds with me in my castle, for fear 
of a surprise. I sAso carried thither all the lead I had left for 
bullets. 

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which are 
said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could 
come at them ; for I persuaded myself while I was here, if live 
hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out ; 
or if they did, they would not venture to attack me. 

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this island, 
and was so naturalised to the place, and to my manner of living, 
that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would 
come to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitu- 
lated for spending the rest of my time there, even to the last mo- 
ment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old goat in the 
cave. I had also contrived some little diversions and amusements, 
which made the time pass more pleasantly with me a great deal 
than it did before ; as, first, I had taught my Poll, as I noted 
before, to speak ; he did it so familiarly, and talked so articu- 
lately, that it was very pleasant to me ; and he lived with me no 
less than six-and- twenty years. My dog was a very pleasant 
and loving companion to me for no less than sixteen years of 
my time, and then died of mere old age. As for my cats, they 
multiplied to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several of 



lOS LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had ; 
but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were 
gone, and after some time continually driving them from me, 
and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild 
into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept 
tame, and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned. 
And these were part of my family. Besides these, I always kept 
two or three household kids about me, which I taught to feed 
out of my hand ; and I . had also more parrots which talked 
pretty well, and would all call " Robin Crusoe,*' but none like 
my first ; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them 
that I had done with him. I had also several tame sea-fowls, 
whose names I know not, which I caught upon the shore ; and 
the little stakes which I had planted before my castle-wall, 
being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived 
among these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable 
tome; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented 
with the life I led, if it might but have been secured from the 
dread of the savages. 

But it was otherwise directed ; and it may not be amiss for all 
people who shall meet with my story to make this just observa- 
tion from it, namely, how frequently, in the course of our lives, the 
evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we 
are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very 
means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be 
raised again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give 
many examples of this in the course of my life ; but in nothing 
was it more remarkable than in the circumstances of my last 
years of residence in this island. 

It was now the month of December ; and this being the 
southern solstice, for winter I cannot call it, was the time of 
my harvest, and required my being pretty much abroad in the 
fields : when going out rather early in the morning, even before 
it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of 
some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two 
miles, towards the end of the island ; and, to my great affliction, 
it was on mv side of the island. 

I was indeed terribly alarmed at the sight, and stepped short 
within ray grove, not daring to go out lest I might be surprised ; 
and yet I had no more peace within, from my apprehension that 
if these savages, in rambling over the island, should find my 
com standing or cut, or any of my works and improvements, 
they would immediately conclude that there were people in the 
place, and would then never give over till they had found me 
out. In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, and 
pulled up the ladder after nie, having made all things without 
look as wild and natural as I could. 

Then I prepared myself within; putting myself in a posture 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 109 

of defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to 
say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortifica- 
tion, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the 
last gasp ; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the 
Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver me 
out of the hands of the barbarians ; and in this posture I con- 
tinued about two hours ; but began to be very impatient for in- 
telligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out. 

After remaining a while longer, and musing what I should 
do, I was not able to continue sitting in ignorance ; so setting 
up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a flat 
place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after 
me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill ; and 
pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose^ 
I laid me down flat on the ground, and began to look for the 
place. I presently found there were no less than nine naked 
savages sitting round a small fire they had made ; not to warm 
them, for they had no need of that, the weather being extremely 
hot ; but, as I supposed, to dress some of their diet of human 
flesh which they had brouglit with them ; whether alive or dead 
I could not know. 

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up 
upon the shore; and as it was then ebb tide, they seemed to 
me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. It 
is not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into, 
especially seeing them come on my side the island, and so near 
me too ; but when I observed that their coming must be always 
with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more calm 
in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all 
the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore before; 
and having made this observation, I went abroad about my 
harvest work with the more composure. 

As I expected, so it proved ; for as soon as the tide made to 
the westward, 1 saw them all take boat and row away. As soon 
as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my 
shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great sword by 
my side, without a scabbard ; and with all the speed I was able 
to make, I went away to the hill, where I had discovered the 
flrst appearance of all. As soon as I got thither, which was not 
less than two hours (for I could not go apace, being so loaded 
with arms as I was), I perceived there had been three canoes 
more of savages on that place ; and looking out farther, I saw 
them all at sea together, making over for the main. 

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when, going down 
to the shore, I could see the marks which the dismal work they 
had been about had left behind if, viz. the blood, the bones, and 
part of the flesh of human bodies, devoured by those wretches 
with merriment and sport.. I was so fliled with indignation at 

L 



110 LIFE A^Fd adventures 

the sight, that I began now to premeditate the destruction of the 
next mat I saw there, let them be how many soever. 

It seemed evident to me that the visits which they thus made 
to this island were not very frequent, for it was above fifteen 
months before any more of them came on shore there again, 
though all this while I lived very uncomfortably, by reason of 
the constant apprehensions I was in of their coming upon me by 
surprise ; from whence I observe that the expectation of evil is 
more bitter than the sufferiner, especially if there is no room to 
shake off that expectation or those apprehensions. 

As I have said, a year and three months more elapsed before I 
saw any more of the savages. The perturbation of my mind during 
this interval was very great ; I slept unquietly, and often started 
out of my sleep ; in the day great troubles overwhelmed my 
tnind, and in the night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and 
the reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But to waive all 
this for a while, it was in the middle ot May, (on the sixteenth 
day, I think^ as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, 
for I marked all upon the post still,) that it blew a very great 
^torm of wind all day, with a great deal of lightning and thunder, 
and a very foul night it was after it. I know not what was the 
particular occasion of it; but as I was reading in my Bible, and 
taken up with verj^ serious thoughts about my present condition, 
I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. 
This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature from 
any I had met with before. I started up in the greatest haste 
imaginable, and in a trice clapped my ladder to the middle place 
of the rock, and pulled it after me ; and mounting it the second 
time, got to the top of the hill the very moment that a flash of 
fire bade me listen for a second gun, which accordingly in about 
half a minute I heard, and by the sound knew that it was from 
that part of the sea where I was driven out with the current in 
my boat. 

I immediately considered that this must be some ship in dis- 
tress, and that they had some comrade or some other ship in 
company, and fired these guns for signals of distress and to obtain 
help. I had the presence of mind at that minute to think, that 
though I could not help them, yet they might help me ; so I 
brought together all the dry wood I could get at hand, and 
making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. The 
wood was dry and blazed freely, and though the wind blew very 
hard yet it burnt fairly out ; so that I was certain, if there was 
any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it ; and no doubt 
they did ; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard another 
gun, and after that several others, all from the same quarter. I 
plied my fire all night long till day broke ; and when it was broad 
day and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance 
at ^ea, east of the island; whether a sail or a hull I could not 



CH. IV. OF BOBIKSON CRUSOE. Ill 

distingaish, no, not with my glass, the distance was so great and 
the weather still something hazy. 

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that 
it did not move, so I presently concluded that it was a ship at 
anchor ; and being eager to be satisfied, I took my gun in my 
hand, and ran toward the south side of the island to the rocks, 
-where I had been formerly carried away by the current ; and 
getting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly clear, I 
coald plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck of a ship cast 
away in the night upon those concealed rocks which I found when 
I was out in my boat ; and which rocks, as they checked the vio- 
lence of the stream, and made a kind of counter-stream or eddj', 
were the occasion of my recovering then from the most hopeless 
<M>ndition I had ever been in in all my life. 

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction ; 
for it seems that these men, whoever they were, being out of their 
knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had been 
driven upon them in the night, the wina blowing hard at e. and 
E.N.E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose 
they did not, they must, as I thouglit, have endeavoured to have 
saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat ; but the firing 
of their guns for help, especially when they saw, as I imagined, 
my fire, filled me with many thoughts. First, I imagined that, 
upon seeing my light, they might have put themselves into their 
boat, and have endeavoured to make the shore ; but that the sea 

foing very high, they might have been cast away. Other times 
imagined they had some other ship or ships in company, who, 
upon the signals of distress they had made, had taken them up 
and carried them off; otherwhiles I fancied they were all gone off 
to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the current that 
I had been formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, 
where there was nothing but misery and perishing, and that per- 
haps they might by this time think of starving, and of being in a 
condition to eat one another. 

As all these were but conjectures, so, in the condition I was in, 
I could do no more than look upon the misery of the poor men 
and pity them, which had still this good effect on m}' side that it 
gave me more and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so 
happily and comfortably provided for me in my desolate con- 
dition; and that of two ships' companies, who were now cast 
away upon this part of the world, not one life should be spared 
but mine. I learned here again to observe, that it is very rare 
that the providence of God casts us into any condition of life so 
low, or aay misery so great, but we may see something or other 
to be thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances 
than our own. 

Such, certainly, was the case of these men, of whom I could 
not so much as see room to suppose any of them were saved; 



112 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

nothing could make it rational so much as to wish or expect that 
they did not all perish there, except the possibility only of their 
being taken up by another ship in company ; and this was but 
mere possibility, for I saw not the least signal or appearance of 
any such thing. 

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a 
strange longing 1 felt m my soul upon this sight, breaking out 
sometimes thus : Oh, that there had been but one or two, nay, 
but one soul saved out of the ship to have escaped to me, that I 
might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature to have 
spoken to me and to have conversed with ! In all the time of my 
solitary life I never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the 
society of my fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want 
of it. 

But it was not to be : either their fate, or mine, or both, for- 
bade it; for till the last year of my being on this island I never 
knew whether any were saved out of that ship or not, and had 
only the affliction some days after to see the corpse of a drowned 
boy come on shore, at the end of the island which was next the 
shipwreck. He had on no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a 
pair of open-kneed lined drawers, and a blue linen shirt ; but 
nothing to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of. 
He had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight and a 
tobacco-pipe : the last was to me of ten times more value than 
the first. 

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in 
my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I might find something 
on board that might be useful to me ; but that did not altogether 
infiuence me so much as the possibility that there might be yet 
some living creature on board, whose life I might not only save, 
but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last degree. 
And this thought clung so to my heart that I could not be quiet 
night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on board this 
wreck ; and committing the rest to God's providence, I thought 
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be 
resisted, that it must come &om some invisible direction^ and that 
I should be wanting to myself if I did not go. 

With these views I hastened back to my castle, prepared 
every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a pot for 
fresh water, a compass, a bottle of rum, a basket full of raisins ; 
and thus loading myself, I went down to my boat, baled the water 
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and 
then went home again for more. My second cargo was a great 
bag full of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for shade, 
another large pot full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my 
small loaves or barley cakes more than before, with a bottle of 
goat's milk and a cheese ; all which, with great labour, I brought 
to my boat 5 and praying to God to direct my voyage, I put out. 



CH. IV. OP ROBINSON CRUSOB. 113 

and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last to 
the utmost point of the island on that side, viz. n.b. And now I 
was to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to 
venture. I looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on 
both sides of the island at a distance, and which were very terrible 
to me, from the remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, 
and my heart began to fail me ; for I foresaw that if I was driven 
into either of those currents, I should be carried a vast way out to 
sea, and perhaps out of reach or sight of the island again ; and 
that then, as my boat was but small, if any little gale of wind 
should rise, I should be inevitably lost. 

These thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give 
over my enterprise, and having hauled my boat into a little creek 
on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a little rising 
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire, about 
my voyage ; when, as I was musing, I could perceive that the 
tide was turned, and the flood came on, which made my going for 
so many hours impracticable. Upon this it presently occurred 
to me that I should go up to the highest piece of ground 1 could 
find, and observe, if 1 could, how the sets of the tide or currents 
lay when the flood came in, that I migjht judge whether, if I was 
driven one way out, I might not expect to be driven another way 
home, with the same rapidness of the currents. This thought was 
no sooner in my head but I cast my eye upon a little hill which 
sufficiently overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I had 
a clear view of the currents or sets of the tide, and which way I 
was to guide myself in my return. Here I found, that as the cur- 
rent of the ebb set out close by the south point of the island, so the 
current of the flood set in close by the shore of the north side, and 
that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north of the island in 
my return, and I should do well enough. 

Encouraged with this observation, 1 resolved the next morning 
to set out with the first of the tide ; and reposing myself" for the 
night in the canoe, under the great watchcoat I mentioned, I 
launched out. I made first a little out to sea full north, till I 
began to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and 
which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurrv me as 
the southern-side current had done before, and so as to take from 
me all government of the boat ; but having a strong steerage with 
my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck, and in 
less than two hours I came up to it. 

It was a dismal sight to look at ; the ship, which, by its build- 
ing, was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in between two rocks ; all 
the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea ; 
and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with 
great violence, her mainmast and foremast were broken short off", 
but her bowsprit was sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. 
When I came close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing

me coming, yelped and cried, and as soon as I called bim jumped 
into the sea to come to me ; and I took him into the boat, but 
found him almost dead for hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake 
of my bread, and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been 
starving a fortnight in the snow. 

After this I went on board ; but th6 first sight I met with was 
two men drowned in the cook-room or forecastle of the ship, with 
tbeir arms fast about one another. I concluded, as is indeed pro- 
bable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the sea 
broke so higb and so continually over her that the men were not 
able to bear it, and were drowned with the constant rushing in of 
the water, as much as if they bad been under water. Besides the 
dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had life, nor any goods 
that I could see but what were spoiled by the water. There were 
some casks of liquor, whether wme or brandy I knew not, which 
lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I 
could see ; but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several 
chests which I believed belonged to some of the seamen, and I 
got two of them into the boat without examining what was in 
them. 

Had the stern of the ship been fixed and the fore part broken 
off, I am persuaded I might have made a good voyage ; for by 
what I found in these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship 
had a great deal of wealtb on board ; and if I may guess by the 
course sbe steered, she must have been bound from the Buenos 
Ay res or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, be- 
yond the Brazils, to the Havanna, in the gulf of Mexico, and so 
perhaps to Spain. She bad, no doubt, a great treasure in her, 
but of no use at that time to any body j and what became of the 
rest of her people I then knew not. 

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of 
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difl5- 
culty ; there were several muskets in a catin, and a great powder- 
horn, with about four pounds of powder in it. As for the mus- 
kets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took the 
powder-horn. I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted 
extremely ; as also two little brass kettles, a copper pot to make 
chocolate, and a gridiron. And with this cargo and the dog I 
came away, the tide beginning to make home again; and the 
same evening, about an nour within night, I reached the island 
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. 

I reposea that night in the boat ; and in the morning I resolved 
to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, and not to carry it 
home to my castle. After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo 
on shore, and began to examine it. The cask of liquor I found 
to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils, and, 
in a word, not at all good. But when I came to open the chests, 
J found several things of great use to me j for example, I found 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRITSOB, 115 

in one a fine case of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled 
with cordial waters, fine and very good. The bottles held about 
three pints each, and were tipped with silver. I found two 
pots of very good sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that 
the salt water had not hurt them ; and two more of the same 
which the water had spoiled. I found some very good shirts, 
which were very welcome to me, and about a dozen and a half of 
white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the former 
were also very welcome, bein^ exceeding refreshing to wipe my 
face in a hot day. Besides this, when 1 came to the till in the 
chests, I found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which 
held about eleven hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, 
wrapt up in a paper, six doubloons of gold, and some small bars 
or wedges of gold. 1 suppose they might all weigh near a 
pound. 

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little 
value ; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the 
gunner's mate, though there was no powder in it, but about two 
pounds of glazed powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, for 
charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. As to the money 
above mentioned, I had no manner of occasion for it ; it was to 
me as the dirt under my feet, and I would have eiven it for three 
or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things I 
greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet now for many years. 
I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the 
feet of the two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck ; and I 
found two pair more in one of the chests, which were very wel- 
come to me. But they were not like our English shoes, either 
for ease or service, being rather what we call pumps than shoes. 
I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals^ 
but no gold. I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the 
other, which seemed to belong to some officer. 

However, I carried this money home to my cave, and laid it 
up, as I had done that before whicn I brought from our own ship ; 
but it was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of the ship 
had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I might have loaded 
my canoe several times over with money, which, if I had ever 
escaped to England, would have lain here safe enough till 1 came 
again and fetched it. 

Having now brought all my things on shore and secured them, 
I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the 
shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best 
of my way to my old habitation, where I found every thing safe 
and quiet. So 1 began to repose myself after my old fashion, and 
take care of my family afiiEiirs ; and for a while 1 lived easy 
enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to be, looked 
out oftener, and did not go abroad so much ; and if at any time I 
did stir wiUi any freedom, it was always to the east part of the 



116 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never came, 
and where I could go without so many precautions, and such a 
load of arms and ammunition as 1 always carried with me if I 
went the other way. 

I lived in this condition near two years more ; but my unlucky 
head was all this time filled with projects and designs how, if it 
were possible, I might get away from this island. Sometimes I 
was for making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason 
told me that there was nothing left there worth the hazard of so 
doing ; sometimes for a ramble one way, sometimes another ; and 
I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went from Sallee in, 
I should have ventured to sea, bound any where, I knew not 
whither. 

On one of the nights in the rainy, season in March, the four- 
and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of soli- 
tariness, I was lying in my bed or hammock awake, and very 
well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, 
no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by 
no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep ; no, not a wink 
all night lon^, otherwise than as follows : 

It is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable 
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare 
of the brain, — the memory, — in this night's time. I ran over 
the whole history of my life in miniature, to my coming to this 
island ; and also of the part of my life since that event. In my 
reflections upon the latter period, I was comparing the happy 
posture of my aftairs in the first years of my habitation here, 
compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and care, which I had lived 
ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand ; not that I 
did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the 
while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times on 
the shore there ; but I hadi never known it ; and I was as happy 
in not knowing my danger, as if I had never really been exposed 
to it. This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable 
reflections, and particularly this one : How infinitely good that 
Providence is, which has provicied in its government of mankind 
such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things ; and 
though he walks in the midst of so many tliousand dangers, the 
sight of which, if discovered to him, would distract his mind, 
and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm by Viaving the 
event of things hid from his eyes, and knowing nothing of the 
dangers which surround hitn. 

After these thoughts had for some time occupied me, I came 
to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so 
many years in this island ; and how I had walked about in the 
greatest security and with all possible tranquillity, even when 
perhaps nothing but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the casual 
spproach of nighty had been between me and the worst kind of 



CH. IV. OP B0BIN80N CKUSOB. 117 

destruction, tIi. that of fEtlUng into the hand* of cuinibak, who 
vould have thought it no more a crime to kill and devour me, 
than I did of a iiigeon or a curlew. I should unjustly slander 
myself, if T should aay I was not sincerely thankful to mv great 
Preserver, to whose singular protection I acknowledged, with 
great humility, that all these unknown deliverances were due, 
and without which I must inevitably have &llen into their mer- 
ciless bands.

vaited a good while, listening la hpar if they made any 
noise ; I at length set my guns at the foot of my ladder, 
and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two 
stages, as usual ; standing so, however, that my head did 
not appear above the hill, so that they could not per- 
ceive me by any means. Here I observed, by the help 
of iny perspective glass, that the savages were no less 
than thirtv in number ; that they bad a nre kindled ; that 
they had liad meat dressed : how they had cooked it, that 
I knew not, or what it was ; but ihey were all dancing, 
in I know not how many barbarous gestures and figures, i 
own fashion, round the ^re. 

While I was thus looking at them, I perceived two miserable 
wretches dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were 
laid by, and now brought out for slaughter. 1 perceived one of 
them immediately fall, being knocked down, 1 suppose, with a 
club or wooden sword, for that was their way ; and two or three 
Others at work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, 






CH. V. ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 119 

while the other victim was left standing by himself, till they 
should be ready for him. At that very moment, this poor 
wretch, seeing himself a little at liberty, and inspired with 
hopes of life, started away from them, and ran with incredible 
swiftness along the sands, directly towards that part of the coast 
where my habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frightened (I must acknowledge) when I 
perceived him to run my way, and especially when, as I thought, 
I saw him pursued by the whole body ; and now I expected that 
he would certainly take shelter in my grove. However, I kept 
my station, and my spirits began to recover, when I found that 
there were not above three men that followed him ; and still 
more was I encouraged, when I found he outstript them exceed- 
ingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that if he could 
but hold it out for half an hour, I saw he would fairly get away 
from them all. 

There was between them and my castle the creek, which I 
mentioned often at the first part of my storj^ when I landed my 
cargoes out of the ship ; and this I saw plainly he must neces- 
sarily swim over, or be taken ; but when the savage escaping 
came thither, he made nothing of it, though the tide was then 
up ; but plunging in, swam through in about thirty strokes, or 
thereabouts, landed, and ran on with exceeding strength and 
swiftness. When the three persons came to the creek, I found 
that two of them could swim, but the third could not, and that, 
standing on the other side, he looked at the other, but went no 
farther ; and soon after went softly back again. 

I observed that the two who swam were yet more than twice 
as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled from 
them. It came now irresistibly upon my thoughts, that I was 
called plainly by Providence to save this poor creature's life, 
I immediately ran down the ladders with all possible expedition, 
fetched my two guns, and getting up again with the same haste 
to the top of the hill, crossed toward the sea, and having a very 
short cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way between 
the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, 
who, looking back, was at first perhaps as much frightened at 
me as I at them. However I beckoned with my hand to him to 
come back ; and in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards 
the two that followed ; then rushing at once upon the foremost, 
I knocked him down with the stock of my piece ; on which, the 
other who pursued with him stopped, as if he had been fright- 
ened, and I advanced apace towards him ; but as I came nearer, 
I perceived presently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it 
to shoot at me ; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first ; 
which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The poor savage 
who fled, but had stopped, though he saw both* his enemies 
fallen, and killed (as he thought) yet was so frightened with the 



120 ^ LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

fire and noise of my piece, that he stood stock-still, and neither 
came forward nor went backward, though he seemed rather in- 
clined to fly than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and 
made siens to come forward, which he easily understood, and 
came a little way, then stopped a^ain, and then a little further, 
and stopped again ; and I could then perceive that he stood 
trembling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had just been 
to be killed, as his two enemies were. I beckoned him again 
to come to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement that 
I could think of ; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down 
every ten or twelve steps, in token of acknowledgment for saving 
his me. I smiled at him and looked pleasantly, and beckoned 
to him to come still nearer. At length he came close to me, and 
he then kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid his 
head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot 
upon his head. This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be 
my slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and 
encouraged him all I could. But there was more work to do 
yet ; for I perceived the savage I had knocked down was not 
killed, but only stunned with the blow, and beffan to come to 
himself; so I pointed to him, and shewed him the savage, that 
he was not dead : upon this he spoke some words to me ; and 
though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were 
pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a man's voice 
that I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. 
But there was no time for such reflections now : the savage who 
was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit up upon the 
ground ; and I perceived that my savage began to be afraid ; 
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at the man, as 
if I would shoot him : upon this my savage made a motion to me 
to lend him my sword (which hung naked in a belt by my side), 
which I did ; and he no sooner had it, than he ran to his enemy, 
and at one blow cut off" his head so cleverly, that no execu- 
tioner in Germany could have done it sooner or better ; which 
I thought very strange for one who, I had reason to believe, 
never saw a sword in his life before, except their own wooden 
swords. However, it seems, as I learned afterwards, they make 
their wooden swords so sharp and heavy, and the wood is so 
hard, that they will cut off" heads even with them, ay and arms, 
and that at one blow too. When he had done this, he came 
laughing to me, in sign of triumph, and brought me the sword 
again, and, with abundance of gestures, which I did not under- 
stand, laid it down, with the head of the savage that he had 
killed, just before me. 

But that which astonished him most was, to know how I had 
killed the other Indian so far ofi": so pointing to him, he made 
signs to me*to let him go to him ; so I bade him go, as well as 
I could. When he came to him^ he stood like one amazed, look- 



CH. y. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 121 

ing at him; turned him first on one eide, then on the other; 
looked at the wound the bullet had made, which it seems was 
just in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great quan- 
tity of blood had followed (but he had bled inwardly, for he was 
quite dead) : then took up his bow and arrows, and came back. 
So I turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making 
ngns to him that more might come after them. 

Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them with 
sand, that they mi^t not be seen by the rest, if they followed ; 
and so I made signs to him to do so ; on which, he fell to work, 
and in an instant had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands 
big enough to bury the first in, and he then dragged him into it, 
and covered him, and did so al^o by the other. 1 believe he had 
buried them both in a quarter of an hour; then calling him away, 
I carried him not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the 
farther part of the island. 

Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a 
draught of water, which I found he was, indeed, in great distress 
for, by his running ; and having refreshed him, I made signs for 
him to lie down and sleep, pointin? to a place where I had laid 
a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which 1 used 
to sleep upon myself sometimes : so the poor creature lay down 
and went to sleep. 

He was a comely handsome fellow, well made, with straight 
long limbs not too large, tall, and well-shaped ; and, as I reckon, 
about twenty -six years of age. There was something very manly 
in his &ce, and yet he had all the sweetness and softness of a 
European in his countenance too, especially when he smiled; 
his hair was long and black, his forehead very hi^h and ^^g^ 
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The 
colour of his skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet 
not of an ugly vellow tawny, as Brazilians and Virginians, and 
other natives of America are, but of a bright kind of dun olive 
colour, that had in it something agreeable, though not very 
easy to describe. His face was round and plump, his nose 
small, not flat like the neCToes, a very good mouth, thin lips, 
and his fine teeth were weU-set, and white as ivory. After he 
had slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he wake d 
again, and came out of the cave to me, — for I had been milk- 
ing my goats, which I had in the enclosure just by. When 
he espied me, he came running to me, laying himself down 
again upon the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble 
thankful disposition, making many antic gestures to shew it. 
At last he laid his head fiat upon the ground, close to my foot, 
and set my other foot upon his head, as he had done before; 
and after this, made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, 
and submission imaginable, to let me know how lie would serve 
me as long as he lived* I understood him in many things, and 

X 



122 LIFE AND AOYEMTURBS 

let him know I was very well pleased with him. In a little time 
I began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me ; and 
first, I made him know his name should be Friday, which was 
the day I saved his life ; I called him so for the memory of the 
time. I likewise taught him to say Master, and then let him 
know that was to be my name ; I likewise taught him to say 
Tea and No, and to know the meaning of them. I gave him 
some milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before 
him, and sop my bread in it ; and I gave him a cake of bread to 
do the like, which he quickly complied with, and made signs 
that it was very good. 

I stayed there with him all that night ; but as soon as it was 
day, I beckoned him to come with me, and let him know I would 
give him some clothes ; at which he seemed very glad. As we 
went by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed 
exactly to the spot, and shewed me the marks that he had made 
to find them again, making signs to me that we should dig them 
up again and eat them. At this I appeared very angry, expressed 
my abhorrence of it, and beckoned with my hand to nim to come 
away, which he did immediately with great submission. I then 
led him up to the top of the hill, to see if his enemies were 
gone; and pulling out my glass, I looked, and saw plainly the 
place where they had been, but no appearance of them or of 
their canoes; so it was plain that they were gone, and had 
left their two comrades behind them, without any search after 
them. 

But I was not content with this discovery ; ar.d having now 
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I took my man 
Friday with me to the place where these creatures had been ; 
for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of them. 
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in my 
yeins, and my heart sank within me at the horror of the spec- 
tacle ; though Friday made nothing of it. The place was covered 
with human bones, the ground dyed with blood, great pieces of 
flesh left here and there half-eaten, mangled, and scorched ; and, 
in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been 
making there. I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of 
three or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the 
bodies ; and Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they 
brought over four prisoners to feast upon ; that three of them 
were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the fourth ; 
that there had been a great battle between them and their next 
king, whose subjects, it seems, he had been one of; and that they 
had taken a great number of prisoners, all which were carried to 
several places by those that had taken them in the fight, in order 
to feast upon them, as was done here upon those tney brought 
hither. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, fiosh, and 



CH. v. OF ROBINSON CftUSOE. 123 

"whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and make 
a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday 
had still a hankering stomaoh after some of the flesh, and was 
still a cannibal in his nature ; but I shewed so much abhorrence 
at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of it, that 
he durst not discover it; for I had, by some means, let him know 
that I would kill him if he offered it. 

When we had done this, we came back to our castle, and 
there I fell to work for my man Friday. And first of all, I gave 
him a pair of linen drawers, which I had out of the gunner's chest 
I mentioned, and which I found in the wreck ; and these, with a 
little alteration, fitted him very well : then I made him a jerkin 
of goat's-skin as well as my skill would allow, and I was now 
erown a tolerably ^ood tailor ; and I gave him a cap, which I 
had made of hare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable enough ; 
and thus he was dressed, for the present, tolerably well, and was 
mighty well pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his 
master. 

The next day after I came home with him, I began to con- 
sider where I should lodge bim ; and that I might do well for 
him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made a little tent for 
him in the vacant place between my two fortifications, in the 
inside of the last, and in the outside of the first. As there was 
a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal framed 
door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the passage, 
a little within the entrance ; and causing the door to open on the 
inside, I barred it up in the night, taking in my ladders too ; so 
that Friday could no way come at me in the inside of my inner- 
most wall, without makmg so much noise in getting over, that it 
must needs waken me ; for my first wall had now a complete roof 
over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the 
side of the hill, which was again laid across with small sticks in- 
stead of laths, and then thatched over a great thickness with the 
rice-straw, which was strong like reeds ; and at the hole or place 
which was left to go in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind 
of trap-door, which if it had been attempted on the outside, would 
not have opened at all, but would have fallen down, and made 
a great noise ; and as to weapons, I took them all by my side 
every night. 

But 1 needed none of all this precaution ; for never man had 
a more faithAil, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me ; 
without passions, sullenness, or designs; perfectly obliged and 
engaged ; his very afiections were tied to me, like tnose of a child 
to a father ; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life for 
the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever : the many testi- 
monies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt ; and soon con- 
vinced me, that I needed to use no precautions as to my safety on 
hia account. 



124 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with 
wonder, that however it had pleased God in His providence, and 
in the government of the works of His hands, to take from so 
great a part of the world, of His creatures, the best use to which 
their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted; yet 
that He has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same 
reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness and 
obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the 
same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities 
of doing good and receiving good, that He has given to us ; and 
that when He pleases to offer to them occasions of exerting these, 
they are as ready, nay more ready, to apply them to the right 
uses for which they were bestowed than we are. And this made 
me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several oc- 
casions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, even 
though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of 
instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of His 
word, added to our understanding ; and why it has pleased God 
to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls, 
who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much 
better use of it tnan we did. 

From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the sove- 
reignty of Providence ; and, as it were, arraign the justice of so 
arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that light from 
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from 
both : but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this con- 
clusion: — First, that we did not know by what light and law 
these should be condemned ; but that as God was necessarily, 
and by the nature of His being, infinitely holy and just, so it 
could not be, but that if these creatures were all sentenced to 
absence from Himself, it was on account of sinning against that 
light, which, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and 
by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, 
though the foundation was not discovered to us ; and, secondly, 
that still, as we are clay in the hands of the potter^ no vessel 
could say to him. Why hast thou formed me thus? 

But to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted 
with him, and made it my business to teach him every thing that 
was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful ; but especi- 
ally to make him speak, and understand me when I spoke. And 
indeed he was the aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly 
was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he 
could but understand me, or make me understand him, that it 
was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my life began 
to be so easy that I began to say to myself, that could I but have 
been safe from more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove 
from the place while I lived. 

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I 



CH. V. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 125 

thought that, hi order to hringr Friday off from his former way of 
feeding, I ought to let him taste other flesh ; so I took him out 
with me one morning to the woods. I went, indeed, intending 
to kill a kid out of my own flock, and bring bim home and dress 
it ; but as I was going, I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, 
and two young kids sitting by her. I caught hold of Friday, 
" Hold," said I, " stand still ;" and made signs to him not to 
stir ; immediately I presented my piece, shot and killed one of 
the kids. The poor creature, who had, at a distance indeed, 
seen mf kill tbe savage, his. enemy, but did not know nor could 
imagine how it was done, was sensibly surprised ; he trembled 
and looked so amazed, that I thought he would have sunk down ; 
he did not see the kid I shot at, or perceive I had killed it, but 
opened his waistcoat to feel if he was not wounded ; and, as I 
found, presently thought I was resolved to kill him ; for he came 
and kneeled down to me, and, embracing my knees, said a great 
many things I did not understand : but I could easily see that 
the meaning was to pray me not to kill him. 

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no 
harm; and taking: him up by the hand, laughed at him, and 
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run 
and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering and 
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun 
again, and by and by I saw a large parrot sit upon a tree 
within shot : so, to let Friday understand a little what I would 
do, I called him to me again, pointing to the parrot, and to 
my gun, and to the ground under the parrot, to let him see I 
would make him fall, and made him understand that I would shoot 
and kill that bird ; accordingly I fired, and bid him look', and 
immediately he saw the parrot fall. He stood like one fright- 
ened again, notwithstanding all I had said to him ; and I found 
he was the more amazed, because he did not see me put any 
thing into the gun ; but thought there must be some wonderful 
fund of death and destruction in that thing, able to kill man, 
beast, bird, or any thing near or far off: and the astonishment 
this created in him was such as could not wear off for a long 
time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have 
worshipped me and my gun : as for the ^un itself, he would not 
so much as touch it for several days after ; but would speak to 
it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when he was bv 
himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to desire it 
not to kill him. 

Well, after his astonishment was a little over at this, I 
pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he 
did, but stayed some time ; for the parrot, not being quite dead, 
had fluttered a good way off from the place where she fell ; 
however, he found her, took her up, and brought her to me : 
and, as I had perceived bis ignorance about the gun before, I 

m2 



126 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

took this advantage to charge the gun again, and fiot let him see 
me do it, that I might be ready for any other mark that miprht pre- 
sent itself; but nothing more offered at that time ; so I brought 
home the kid ; and the same evening I took the skin off, and 
cut it out as well as I could ; and having a pot for that purpose, 
I boiled or stewed some of the flesh, and made some very good 
broth. After I had begun to eat sorqe, I gave some to my man, 
who seemed very glad of it, and liked it very well ; but that 
which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat salt with it. He 
made a sign to me that the salt was not good to eat ; and f putting 
a little into his own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would 
spit and sputter at it, washing his mouth with fresh water after 
it ; on the other hand, I took some meat in my mouth without 
salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter for want of salt as fast 
as he had done at the salt : but it would not do, he would never 
care for salt with meat, or in his broth ; at least, not for a great 
while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was 
resolved to feast him the next day with roasting a piece of 
the kid : this I did by hanging it before the fire suspended from 
a string, as I had seen many people do in England, setting two 
poles up, one on each side the fire, and one across the top, and 
tying the string to the cross stick, letting the meat turn con- 
tmually: this Friday admired very much; but when he came 
to taste the flesh, he took so many ways to tell me how well he 
liked it, that I could not but understand him ; and at last he 
told me he would never eat man's flesh any more, which I was 
very glad to hear. 

The next day I set him to work to beating some com out, and 
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before ; and 
he soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially after he 
had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was to make 
bread of: for after that I let him see me make my bread, and 
bake it too ; and in a little time Friday was able to do all the 
"work for me, as well as I could do it myself. 

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to feed in- 
stead ot one, 1 must provide more ground for my harvest, and 
plant a larger quantity of com than I used to do ; so I marked 
out a larger piece of land, and began the fence in the same man- 
ner as before, in which Friday not only worked very hard, but 
very cheerfully ; and I told him what it was for, that it was for 
corn to make more bread, because he was now with me, and that 
I might have enough for him and myself too : he appeared very 
sensible of that, and let me know that he thought I had much 
more labour upon me on his account than I had for myself, and 
that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him what 
to do. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place. 



CH. T. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 127 

Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of 
almost every thing I had occasion to call for, and of every place 
I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to me ; ^o that, in 
short, I began now to have some use for my tongue again, which 
indeed I had very little occasion for before. Besides the pleasure 
of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction in the fellow him- 
self ; his simple unfeigned honesty appeared to me more and 
more every day, and I began really to love the creature; and 
on his side, I believe, he loved me more than it was possible for 
him ever to love any thing before. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination 
to his own country again ; and having taught him English so well 
that he could answer me almost any questions, I asked him whe- 
ther the nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle? 
At which he smiled, and said, *^ Yes, yes, we always fight the 
better ;" that is, he meant, always get the better in fight ; and 
so we began the following discourse. " You always fight the 
better I" said I. " How came you to be taken prisoner then^ 
Friday ?" 

Friday. My nation beat much for all that. 

Master, How, beat ! if your nation beat them, how came you 
to be taken ? 

Friday, They more many than my nation in the place where 
me was ; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation over 
beat them in the yonder place where me no was : there my na- 
tion take one, two, great thousand. 

Master, But why did not your side recover you from the 
hands of your enemies then ? 

Friday, They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in 
the canoe ; my nation have no canoe that time. 

Master, Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with 
the men they take ? Do they carry them away, and eat them as 
these did ? 

Friday, Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up. 

Master, Where do they carry them ? 

Friday, Go to other place where they think. 

Master, Do they come hither ? 

Friday, Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other else place. 

Master, Have you been here with them ? 

Friday, Yes, I been here [at the same time pointing to the 
W.w. side of the island, which, it seems, was their side]. 

By this I understood that my man Friday had formerly been 
among the savages who used to come on shore on the farther 
part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions that he was 
now brought for ; and some time after, when I took the courage 
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned, 
he presently knew the place, and told me he was there once 
"wlien they eat up twenty men^ two women^ and one child : he 



128 LIVE AND ADVBKTURBS 

could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by 
laying so many stones in a row, and pointed to me to tell them 
over. 

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows ; — 
that after I had had this discourse with him, I asked him how 
far it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoes 
were not often lost ? He told me there was no danger, no canoes 
ever lost; but that after a little way out to sea, there was a cur- 
rent, and wind always one way in the morning, the other in the 
afternoon. 

This I supposed to be no more than the sets of the tide, as 
going out, or coming in ; but I afterwards understood it was 
occasioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty river 
Oroonoque ; in the mouth, or the gulf, of which river, as I 
thought afterwards, our island lay ; and this land, which I per- 
ceived to the w. and n.w. was the great island Trinidad, on the 
north point of the mouth of the river. I asked Friday a thou- 
sand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea, the 
coast, and what nations were near : and he told me all he knew 
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names of 
the several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other 
name than Caribs ; from whence I easily understood that these 
were the Caribbees, which our maps place on the part of America 
which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea, 
and onwards to St. Martha. He told me, that up a great way 
beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon, 
which must be w. from their country, there dwelt white, bearded 
men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, and that they 
had killed " much mans,'' that was his word : by all which I un- 
derstood he meant the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had 
been spread over the whole countries, and was remembered by 
all the nations from father to son. 

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this 
island, and get among those white men : he told me, ** Yes, yes, 
I might go in two canoe." I could not understand what he 
meant, or make him describe to me what he meant by ** two 
canoe ;" till at last, with great difficulty, I found he meant, that 
it must be in a large great boat as big as two canoes. 

This part of Friday's discourse began to please me very well ; 
and from this time t entertained some hopes that one time or 
other I might find an opportunity to make my escape from this 
place, and that this poor savage might be a means to help me to 
do it. 

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and 
that he began to speak to me and understand me, I was not 
wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind. 
Particularly, I asked him one time. Who made him ? The poor 
creature did not understand me at all^ but thought I had asked 



CH. V. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 129 

-who was his father : but I took it by another handle, and asked 
him, who made the sea, the. ground he walked on, and the hills 
and woods ? He told me it was one old Benamuckee, that lived 
beyond all ; he could describe nothing of this great person, but 
that he was very old ; much older, he said, than the sea or the 
land, than the moon or the stars. I asked him then, If this old 
person had made all things, why did not all things worship him ? 
He looked very grave, and with a perfect look of innocence, said, 
** All things do say O ! to him." I asked him if the people who 
die in his country went away any where ? He said *' Yes, they 
all went to Benamuckee." Then I asked him, whether those they 
eat up went thither too? He said ** Yes." 

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge 
of the true God. I told him that the great Maker of all things 
lived up there, pointing up towards heaven. That He governs 
the world by the same power and providence by which He made 
it. That He was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give 
every thing to us, take every thing from us; and thus, by degrees, 
I opened his eyes. He listened with great attention, and re- 
ceived with pleasure the notion of Jesus Christ being sent to 
redeem us, and of the manner of making our prayers to God, 
and His being able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me one 
day, that if our God could hear us up beyond the sun, He must 
needs be a greater God than their Benamuckee, who lived but 
a little way off, and yet could not hear till they went up to the 
great mountains where he dwelt to speak to him. I asked him, 
& ever he went thither to speak to him ? He said. No, they 
never went that were young men ; none went thither but the old 
men, who he called their Oowookakee ; that is, as I made him 
explain it to me, their religious or clergy ; and that they went 
to say O ! (so he called saying prayers) and then came back, and 
told them what Benamuckee said. I endeavoured to clear up 
this fraud to my man Friday, and told him, that the pretence of 
their old men going up to the mountains to say O ! to their god 
Benamuckee, was a cheat ; and their bringing word from thence 
what he said, was much more so ; that if they met with any an- 
swer, or spoke with any one there, it must be with an evil spirit ; 
and then I entered into a long discourse with him about the 
devil, the origin of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to 
man, the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts 
of the world to be worshipped instead of God, and as God, and 
the many stratagems he made use of to delude mankind to their 
ruin ; how he had a secret access to our passions and to our 
affections, to adapt his snares so to our inclinations as to cause 
us even to bo our own tempters, and to run upon our destruc- 
tion by our own choice. 

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his 
mind about the devil as it was about the being of a God ; nature 



ISO XIFB AND ADVENTURES 

assisted all my argaments to evidence to him even the necessity 
of a great First Cause and over-ruling governing Power, a secret 
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying 
homage to Him that made us, and the like ; hut there appeared 
nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit — of his original, 
his heing, his nature, and above all, of his inclination to do evil, 
and to draw us in to do so too ; and the poor creature puzzled me 
once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and inno- 
cent, that I scarce knew what to say to him. I had been talking 
a great deal to him of the power of God, His omnipotence, His 
hatred to sin. His bein? a consuming fire to the workers of ini- 
quity ; how, as He had made us all. He could destroy us and all 
the world in a moment ; and he listened with great seriousness 
to me all the while. 

After this, I had been telling him how the devil was God's 
enemy in the hearts of men, and used all his malice and skill to 
defeat the good designs of Providence, and to ruin the kingdom 
of Christ in the world, and the like. " Well," said Friday, 
" but you say God is so strong, so great, is He not much strong, 
much might as the devil?" ''Yes, yes," said I ; *' Friday, God 
is stronger than the devil : God is above the devil, and therefore 
we pray to God to tread him down under our feet, and enable 
us to resist his temptations, and quench his fiery darts." '* But," 
says he again, " if God much strong, much might as the devil, 
why God no kill the devil, so make him no more do wicked ?" 

I was strangely surprised at his question ; and after all, though 
I was now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill 
enough qualified for a casuist or a solver of difficulties ; and, at 
first, I could not tell what to say ; so I pretended not to hear 
him, and asked him what he said? But he was too earnest for 
an answer to forget his question ; so that he repeated it in the 
very same broken words as above. By this time I had recovered 
myself a little, and I said, *' God will at last punish him severely ; 
he is reserved for the judgment, and is to be cast into the bottom- 
less pit, to dwell with everlasting fire." This did not satisfy 
Friday ; but he returns upon me, repeating my words, " Reserve 
at last ! me no understand ; but why not kill the devil now, not 
kill great ago ?" '* You may as well ask me," said I, " why God 
does not kill you and me, when we do wicked things here that 
ofi^snd Him — we are preserved to repent and be pardoned." He 
mused awhile at this : " Well, well," says he, mighty afiection- 
ately, " that well ; so you, I, devil, all wicked, all preserve, 
repent, God pardon all." Here I was run down again by him 
to the last degree ; and it was a testimony to me, how the mere 
notions of nature, though they will guide reasonable creatures to 
the knowledge of a God, and of a worship or homage due to the 
supreme being of God, as the consequence of our nature ; yet 
nothing but divine revelation can form the knowledge of Jesus 



CH. y. OF ROBINSON CBUSOE. 131 

Christ, and of a redemption purchased for us ; of a Mediator 
and Intercessor at God's throne ; I say nothing but a revelation 
irom Heaven can form these in the soul ; and that therefore the 
Gt>spel of our Lord and Sayiour Jesus Christ is the neces- 
sary instructor of the souls of mea in the saving knowledge of 
God, and the means of salvation. 

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my 
man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going 
out ; then sending him for something a good way off, I seriously 
prayed to God, that He would enable me to instruct savingly 
this poor savage, assisting by His Spirit the heart of the poor 
ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of God 
in Christ reconciling him to Himself, and would guide me to 
so speak to him from the word of God, that his conscience might 
be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved. When he 
came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon 
the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the 
world, and of the doctrine of the Gospel preached from heaven, 
namely, of repentance towards God, and faith in our blessed 
Lord Jksus Christ ; I then explained to him, as well as I 
could, why our blessed Redeemer took not on Him the nature 
of angels, but the seed of Abraham, and how, for that reason, the 
fallen angels had no share in the redemption ; that He came 
only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and the like. 

I had, indeed, more sincerity than knowledge in all the 
methods I took for this poor creature's instruction ; and must 
acknowledge, what I believe all that act upon the same principle 
will find, that in laying things open to him, I really informed 
and instructed myself in many things, that either I did not 
know, or had not fully considered before ; but which occurred 
naturally to my mind, upon my searching into them for the in- 
formation of this poor savage ; and I had more affection in my 
inquiry after things upon this occasion than ever I felt before ; 
so that whether this poor creature was the better for me or not, 
I had great reason to be thankful that ever he came to me. My 
grief sat lighter upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to me 
beyond measure ; and when I reflected, that in this solitary life, 
which I had been confined to, I had not only been moved myself 
to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the hand that had brought 
me there, hut was now to be made an instrument, under Provi- 
dence, to save the life, and, for ought I knew, the soul of a poor 
savage, and bring him to the true knowledge oi* religion and of 
the Christian doctrine, that he might know Christ Jesus, to 
know whom is life eternal; — when I reflected upon all these 
things, a secret joy ran through every part of my soul, and I 
frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which 
I hnd so often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that 
could possibly have befallen me. 



132 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my 
time ; and the conversation which employed the hours between 
Friday and I was such as made the three years which we lived 
there together perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing 
as complete happiness can be found in a sublunary state. The 
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I ; though 
I have reason to hope, and J)less God for it, that we were equally 
penitent, and comforted restored penitents. 

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, and 
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak, 
though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him with my own 
story, or at least so much of it as related to my coming into the 
place ; how I had lived there, and how long. I let him into the 
mystery (for such it was to him) of gunpowder and bullet, and 
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which he was 
wonderfiiUy delighted with ; and I made him a belt with a loop 
hanging to it, such as in England we wear hangers in ; and in 
the loop, instead of a hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was 
not only as good a weapon on some occasions, but much more 
useful upon others. 

I described to him the countries of Europe, and particularly 
England, which I came from ; how we lived, how we worshipped 
God, how we behaved to one another, and how we traded in 
ships to all the parts of the world. I gave him an account of 
the wreck which I had been on board of, and shewed him, as 
near as I could, the place where she lay. I shewed him the 
ruins of our boat, which we lost when we escaped, and which 
I could not stir with my whole strength then, but was now 
fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday stood 
musing a ^reat while, and said nothing. I asked him what it 
was he studied upon? At last, says he, " Me see such boat like 
come to place at my nation." 

I did not understand him a good while ; but, at last, when 
I had examined farther into it, I understood by him, that a boat, 
such as that had been, came on shore upon the country where 
he lived ; that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress 
of weather. I presently imagined that some European ship must 
have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get 
loose, and drive ashore ; but I was so dull, that I never once 
thought of men making escape from a wreck thither, much less 
whence they might come ; so I only inquired after a description 
of the boat. 

Friday described the boat to me well enough ; but brought 
me better to understand him, when he added, with some warmth, 
" We save the white mans from drown." Then I presently asked 
him, if there were any ** white mans," as he called them, in the 
boat ? " Yes," he said, " the boat full white mans." I asked 
him^ how many. He told me^ upon his fingers, seventeen. I 



en. V. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 133 

Bsked him then, what became of them ? he told me, " They live, 
they dwell at my nation." 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presentljr ima- 
gined that these might be the men belonging to the ship that 
was cast away in sight of my island, as 1 now called it ; and 
■who, after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her 
inevitably lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were 
landed upon that wild shore, among the savages. 

Upon this I inquired of him more particularly what was 
become of them? He assured me they lived still there; that 
they had been there about four years ; that the savages let them 
alone, and gave them victuals to eat. I asked him, how it came 
to pass they did not kill them, and eat them? he said, "No, 
they make brother with them;" that is, as I understood him, 
a truce : and then he added, *' They no eat mans but when 
make the war fight ;" that is to say, they never eat any men, 
but such as come to ^ght with them, and are taken in battle. 

It was some considerable time after this, that, being on the 
top of the hill, at the east side of the island, — from whence, as I 
have said, I had in a clear day discovered the main or continent 
of America, — Friday, the weather being very serene, looked very 
earnestly towards the mainland, and in a kind of surprise fell 
a jumping and dancing, and called out to me (for I was at some 
distance from him). I asked him what was the matter. " O 
joy V says he, " O glad I there see my country, there my 
nation V* 

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his 
face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a 
strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his own country 
again ; and this observation of mine put a great many thoughts 
into me, which made me at first not so easy about m^ new man 
Friday as I was before. I began now to think that if he could 
get back to his own nation again, he would not only forget all 
his religion, but all his obligations to me ; that he would be for- 
ward enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and come 
back, perhaps, with a hundred or two of them, and make a feast 
of me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be with those 
of his enemies when they were taken in war. 

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which 
I was heartily sorry afterwards. However, as my jealousy in- 
creased and held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, 
and not so familiar and kind to him as before ; in which I was 
certainly in the wrong too, the honest, grateful creature having no 
thought about it but what consisted with the best principles, both 
as a religious Christian and as a grateful friend, as appeared 
afterwards to my full satisfaction. 

Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, I was every day trying 
him, to see if he would discover any of the new thoughts which 

N 



134 LIPB AND ADVANTUSES 

I suspected were in him ; but I found every thing he said was so 
honest and so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish my 
suspicion, and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he made me at last 
entirely his own again ; nor did he in the least perceive that I 
was uneasy, and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit. 

One day, walking up the same hill, and the weather being 
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called to 
him, and said, ** Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own 
country, your own nation?'' " Yes," he said; ** he be much O 
glad to be at his own nation." " What would you do there?" 
said I, " Would you turn wild again, eat men's flesh again, and 
be a savage as you were before ?" He looked full of concern, and 
shaking his head, said, " No, no ; Friday tell them to live good, 
tell them to pray God, tell them to eat corn bread, cattle flesh, 
milk ; no eat man again." " Why, then," said I to him, " they 
will kill you." He looked grave at that, and then said, ** No, 
they no kill me, they willing love learn." He added, " they 
learned much of the bearded mans that came in the boat." Then 
I asked him if he would go back to them? He smiled at that, 
and told me he could not swim so far. I told him I would make 
a canoe for him. He told me he would go if I would go with 
him. " I go I" said I ; " why, they will eat me if I come there." 
" No, no," says he; ** me make them no eat you, me make they 
much love you." He meant he would tell them how I had killed 
his enemies and saved his life, and so be would make them love 
me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kinc^ they were 
to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who 
came on shore there in distress. 

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and 
see if I coidd possibly join with these bearded men, who, I made 
no doubt, were Spaniards or Portuguese ; not doubting but if I 
could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being 
upon the continent and a good company together, better than I 
could from an island forty miles ofi^ the shore, and alone without 
help. So, after some days, I told Friday I would give him a boat 
to go back to his own nation ; and, accordingly, I carried him to 
my frigate, which lay on the other side of the island, and having 
cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water), I 
brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went into it. 

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it ; and 
could make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could. So 
when he was in, I said to him, " Well now, Friday, shall we go to 
your nation ?" He looked very dull at my saying so, which, it 
seems, was because he thought the boat too small to go so far. I 
told him then I had a bigger ; so the next day I went to the place 
where the first boat lay which I had made, but which I could not 
et into the water. He said that was big enough ; but thnn, as I 
ad taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty 



I 



CH. V. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 135 

years there, the sun had split and dried it, so that it was in a 
manner rotten. Friday told me such a boat would do very well, 
and would carry " much enough drink, bread." 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design 
of going over with him to the continent, that I told him we 
would make one as bi^ as that, and he should go home in it. He 
answered not one word, but looked very ^rave and sad. I asked 
him what was the matter with him ? He asked me again thus, 
** Why you angry with Friday ? what me done V I asked him 
what he meant ? I told him I was not angry with him at all. 
** No angry, no angry V* says he, repeating the words several 
times ; ** why send Friday home away to my nation V ** Why," 
said I, " Friday, did you not say you wished you were there ?" 
** Yes, yes," says he, " wish be both there ; no wish Friday there, 
no master there." In a word, he would not think of going there 
without me. ** I go there, Friday !" said I ; " what should I do 
there ?" He turned very quick upon me at this. " You do great 
deal much good," says he ; " you teach wild mans be good, sober, 
tame mans ; you tell them know God, pray God, and live new 
life.** " Alas, Friday," said I, " thou knowest not what thou 
sayest ; I am but an ignorant man myself." " Yes, yes," says 
he; "you teechee me good, you teechee them good." " No, no, 
Friday," said I, "you shall go without me; leave me here to 
live by myself, as I did before." He looked confused again at 
that word, and running to one of the hatchets which he used to 
wear, he took it up hastily, and came and gave it to me. " What 
must I do with this?" said I to him. " You take kill Friday," 
says he. "What must I kill you for?" said I again. He re- 
turned very quick, " What you send Friday away for ? Take kill 
Friday ; no send Friday away." This he spoke so earnestly that 
I saw tears stand in his eyes ; in a word, I so plainly discovered 
the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in him, 
that I told him then and often after, that I would never send him 
away if he was willing to stay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a settled 
affection to me, and that nothing could part him from me, so I 
found all the foundation of his desire to so to his own country 
was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of my 
doing them good ; a thin^ which as I had no notion of myself, so 
I had not the least intention of undertaking it. But still I found 
a strong inclination to my attempting an escape, as I have said, 
founded on the supposition gathered from the discourse, namely, 
that there were seventeen bearded men there^; and therefore, with- 
out any more delay, I went to work with Friday to find out a great 
tree proper to fell, and make a large canoe to undertake the voy- 
age. There were trees enough in the island to have built a little 
fleet, not of canoes only, but even of good large vessels ; but the 
main thing I looked at was, to get one so near the water that we 



136 LIFE AND ADYENTURES 

might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I com- 
mitted before. 

At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he knew much 
better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it ; nor can I tell 
to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down, except that 
it was very like the tree we call fustic, or between that and the 
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour and smell. 
Priday was for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out to 
make into a boat; but I shewed him how rather to cut it out with 
tools, which, after I shewed him how to use, he did very handily ; 
and in about a month's hard labour we finished it, and made it 
very handsome, especially when, with our axes, which I shewed 
him how to handle, we cut and hewed the outside into the true 
shape of a boat. After this, however, it cost us near a fortnight's 
time to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers 
into the water; but when she was in, she would have carried 
twenty men with great ease. 

When she was in the water, and though she was so large, it 
amazed me to see with what dexterity and how swiftly my man 
Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along ; so I 
asked him if he would, and if we might venture over in her ? 
^' Yes," he said, ^* he venture over in her very well, though great 
blow wind." However, I had a farther design that he knew 
nothing of, and that was, to make a mast and sail, and to fit her 
with an anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough 
to get ; so I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I 
found near the place, and which there was a great plenty of in 
the island, and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him 
directions how to shai)e it. But as to the sail, that was my par- 
ticular care. I knew I had old sails, or rather pieces of old sails 
enough ; but as I had had them now twenty-six years by me, and 
had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining that I 
should ever have this kind of use for them, I did not doubt but 
they were all rotten; and indeed most of them were so. How- 
ever, I found two pieces which appeared pretty good, and with 
these I went to work, and with a great deal of pains and awkward 
tedious stitching for want of needles, I at length made a three- 
cornered ugly thing like what we call in England a shoulder-of- 
mutton sail, to go with a boom at bottom and a little short sprit at 
the top, such as usually our ships' long-boats sail with, and such 
as I best knew how to manage, because it was such a one as I had 
to the boat in which I made my escape from Barbary, as related 
in the first part of my story. 

I was near two months performing this last work, viz. rig- 
ging and fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them very 
complete, making a small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to 
assist, if we should turn to windward ; and, which was more 
than all^ I fixed a rudder to the stern^ to steer with ; and took 



CH. y. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 137 

SO much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass ; though, 
considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that failed, 
I think it cost me almost as much labour as making the boat. 

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as to 
what belonged to the naviocation of my boat ; for though he knew 
very weU how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing of what be- 
longed to a sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when 
he saw me^work the boat to-and-again in the sea by the rudder, 
and how the sail filled this way or that way, as the course we 
sailed changed ; however, with a little use, I made all these 
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except 
that as to the compass, I could make him understand very little 
of that : on the other hand, as there was very little cloudy 
weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was 
the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to 
be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy 
seasons ; and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land 
or sea. 

I had now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my 
captivity in this place ; though the three last years that I had 
this creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account, 
my habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of 
my time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the 
same thankfulness to God for His mercies as at first; and if I 
had such cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so 
now, having such additional testimonies of the care of Provi- 
dence over me, as well as hopes of being effectually and speedily 
delivered ; for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts, 
that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be an- 
other year in this place : however, I went on with my husbandry, 
digging, planting, and fencing, as usual ; I gathered and cured 
my ffrapes, and did every necessary thing, as before. 

The rainy season was in the mean time commenced, when I 
kept more within doors than at other times : so we had our new 
vessel stowed as secure as we could, bringing her up into the 
creek ; and hauling her up to the shore, at high-water mark, I 
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold 
her, and deep enough to float her in ; and then, when the tide 
was out, we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the 
water out ; and so she lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea ; and 
to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees, so 
thick, that she was as well thatched as a house ; and thus we 
waited for the months of November and December, in which I 
designed to make my adventure. 

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of 
my design returned with the lair weather, I was preparing daily 
for the voyage ; and the first thing I did was, to lay by a certain 
quantity ot provision, being the stores for the voyage ; and I in- 

n2 



138 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

tended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and 
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon something 
of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bid him go to the sea* 
chore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which 
we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as 
the fiesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came run-> 
ning back, and flew over my outward wall, or fence, like one 
that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on ; and be- 
fore I had time to speak to him, he cried out to me, ** O master ! 

master ! O sorrow ! O bad V " What's the matter, Friday V 
said I. " O yonder there," said he, '* one, two, three canoe I 
one, two, three !'' By his way of speaking I concluded there 
were six ; but on inquiry I found there were but three. *^ Well, 
Friday," said I, ^* do not be frightened ;" so I heartened him 
up as well as I could. However, I saw the poor fellow was most 
terribly scared ; for nothing ran in his head but that they were 
come to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him ; 
and the poor fellow trembled so, that I scarcely knew what to 
do with him. I comforted %im as well as I could, and told him 

1 was in as much danger as he, and that they would eat me as 
well as him : *' but," said I, " Friday, we must resolve to fight 
them. Can you fight, Friday ?" " Me shoot," says he, " but 
there come many great number." " No matter for that," said 
I again, '* our guns will frighten those we do not kill." So I 
asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would <le- 
fend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him ? He said, 
** Me die, when you bid die, master ;'' so I went and fetched a 
good dram of rum, and gave him ; for I had been so careful of 
my rum that I had a great deal left. When he had drank it, 
I made him take the two fowling-pieces which we always car- 
ried, and load them with large swan-shot, as big as small pistol- 
bullets ; then I took four muskets, and loaded them with two 
slu^s and five small bullets each ; and my two pistols I loaded 
with a brace of bullets each : I hung my great sword, as usual, 
naked by my side, and gave Friday his natchet. 

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my glass, and went 
up to the side of the hill, to see what I could discover ; and I 
found quickly that there were one-and -twenty savages, three 
prisoners, and three canoes, and that their whole business seemed 
to be the triumphant banquet upon these three human bodies ; 
a barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than as I had ob- 
served was usual with them. 

I observed also, that they were landed, not where they had 
done when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek, 
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood came close 
almost down to the sea. This, with the abhorrence of the in- 
human errand these wretches came about, filled me with such 
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and told him. 



CH. y. OF ROBINSON CRUSOK: 139 

I wtfs resolved to go down to theniy and kill them all ; and 
asked him if he wocdd stand by me. He was now gotten over 
his fngrht ; and his spirits being a little raised with the dram I 
had given him, he was very cheerful ; and told me, as before, 
" he would die when I bid die." 

I now took and divided the arms which I had charged be* 
tween us ; I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and 
three guns upon his shoulder; aud I took one pistol, and the 
other three myself; and in this posture we marched out. I 
took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and gave Friday a 
large ba^ with more powder and bullet ; and, as to orders, I 
charged him to keep close behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, 
or do any thing till I bid him ; and, in the mean time, not to 
speak a word : I then fetched a compass to my right hand of 
near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the 
wood ; so that I might come within shot of them before I 
could be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it was easy 
to do. 

While I was making this march, my former thoughts return- 
ing, I began to abate my resolution; I do not mean, that I 
entertained any fear of their number ; for as they were naked, 
unarmed wretches, it is certain I was superior to them ; nay, 
though I had been alone : but it occurred to my thoughts, what 
call, what occasion, much less what necessity, was there to go 
and dip my hands in blood ; to attack people who had neither 
doiie or intended me any wrong ; who, as to me, were innocent, 
and whose barbarous customs were their own disaster, — being in 
them a token indeed of God's having left them, with the other 
nations of that part of the world, to such inhuman courses, — ^but 
did not call me to take upon me to be a judge of their actions, 
much less an executioner of His justice ; that whenever He 
thought fit. He would take the cause into His own hands, and 
by national vengeance punish them, as a people, for national 
crimes ; but that in the mean time, it was none of my business* 
These things were so warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the 
way as I went, that I resolved I would only go and place myself 
near them, that I might observe their barbarous feast, and that I 
would act then as God should direct ; but that, unless something 
ofiered that was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would 
not meddle with them. 

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all pos- 
sible wariness and silence (Friday following close at my heels) 
I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which 
was next to them ; only that one corner of the wood lay between 
me and them. Here I called softly to Friday, and shewing him 
a great tree, which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade 
him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there 
plainly what they were doing. He did so, and came immediately 



140 LIFB AND ADVBNTVRBS 

back to lue, and told me they might be distinctly viewed there ; 
that they were all about the ore, eating the flesh of one of their 
prisoners ; and that another lay bound upon the sand, a little 
from them, whom, he said, they would kill next, and which 
fired the ,very soul within me. He told me, it was not one 
of their nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had told 
me of, that came to their country in the boat. I was filled with 
horror at the very naming of the white, bearded man ; and going 
to the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay 
upon the beach of the sea, with his nands and his feet tied with 
flags ; and that he was a European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, about 
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by 
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, 
and that then I should be within half-shot of them. So I re- 
strained my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the high- 
est degree ; and going back about twenty paces, I got behind 
some bushes, which extended all the way till I came to the other 
tree, and then I came to a little rising ground, which gave me a 
full view of them, at the distance of about eighty yards. 

I had now not a moment to lose ; for nineteen of the dreadful 
wretthes sat upon the ground all close huddled together, and had 
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring 
him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire ; and they were stoop- 
ing down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday ; 
** Now, Friday," said I, ** do exactly as you see me do : fail in 
nothing." So I set down one of the muskets and the fowling- 
piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by his ; and with 
the other musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him do 
the same. Then asking him if he was ready, he said» " Yes." 
''Then fire at them," said I; and the same moment I fired 
also. , 

Fridav took his aim so much better than I, that on the side 
that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three more ; 
and on my side, I killed one, and wounded two. They were, 
you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation : and all of them, 
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet, but did not im- 
mediately know which way to run, or which way to look ; for 
they knew not from whence the destruction came. Friday kept 
his eyes close upon me, that, as I had bid him, he might ob- 
serve what I did ; so soon as the first shot was made, I threw 
down the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did 
the like : he saw me cock, and present ; he did the same. ** Are 
you ready, Friday ?" said I. " Yes," says he. " Let fly then," 
said I, *' in the Name of God ;" and with that I fired again 
among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday ; and as our 
pieces were now loaden with what I called swan-shot, or small 
pistol-bullets, we found only two drop ; but so many were

ing to keep my charge ready, because I had given the Spaniard 
my pistol and sword ; iso I called to Friday, and bade him run up 
to tne tree trom whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which 
lay there, that had been discharged, which he did wiih great 
swiftness ; and then giving him my musket, I sat down myself 
to load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they 
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there happened a 
fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages, 
who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the 
same weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not 
prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as 
could be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a good 
while, and had cut two great wounds on his head ; but the savage, 
being a stout lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him 
down, and was wringing my sword out of his hand, when the 
Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitting his sword, drew the 
pistol from his girdle, shot the savage through the body, and 
killed him on the spot, before I, who was running to help him, 
could come near him. 

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying 
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; and with 
that he despatched those three who, as I said before, were 
wounded at first and fallen, and all the rest he could come up 
with: and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him 
one of the fowling-pieces, with which he pursued two of the 
savages, and wounded them both ; but as he was not able to run, 
they both got from him into the wood, where Friday pursued 
them, and killed one of them ; but the other was too nimble for 
him ; and though he was wounded, yet he had plunged himself 
into the sea, and swam with all his might off to those two who 
were left in the canoe ; which three in the canoe, with one wound- 
ed, were all that escaped our hands of one-and-twenty. The 
account is as follows : 

Three killed at our shot from the tree ; two killed at the next 
shot ; two killed by Friday in the boat ; two killed by Friday, 
of those at first wounded ; one killed by Friday in the wooa ; 
three killed by the Spaniard ; four killed, being found dropped 
here and there, of their wounds, or killed by Friday in his chase 
of them ; four escaped in the boat^ whereof one wounded, if not 
dead ; in all one-and-twenty. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of gun- 
shot ; and though Friday made two or three shots at them, I did 
not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had 
me take one of their canoes, and pursue them ; and indeed, I was 
very anxious about their escape, lest, carrying the news home to 
their people, they should come back, perhaps, with two or three 
hundred of their canoes, and devour us by mere multitude. So I 
consented to pursue them by sea; and running to one of their 



CH. y. OF B0BIN80N CRUSOE. 143 

canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me ; but when I 
was in the cauoe, I was surprised to tind another poor creature 
lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for 
the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what the 
matter was ; for he had not been able to look up over the side of 
the boat, be was tied so fast. 

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which they had 
bound him with, and would have helped him up ; but he could 
not stand, or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it 
seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed. 

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell 
him of his deliverance : and pulling out my bottle, made him 
give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being 
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when 
Friday came to hear him speak, and looked in his face, it would 
have moved any one to tears, to have seen how he kissed him, 
embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped 
about, danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his 
own face and head, and then sung and jumped about again like 
a distracted creature. It was a good while before I could make 
him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter ; but when he 
came a little to himself, he told me that it was his father. 

It was not easy for me to express how it moved me, to see 
what ecstasy and filial affection bad worked in this poor savage 
at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death ; 
nor indeed can I describe half the extravagances of his affection 
after this ; for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great 
many times; when he went in to him, he would sit down by him, 
and hold his father's head close to his bosom half an hour to-< 
gether ; then he took his arms and ankles, which were numbed 
and stiff with the binding, and chafed and rubbed them with his 
hands ; and I, perceiving what the case was. gave him some rum 
out of my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal 
of good. 

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the 
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight ; and it 
was happy for us that we did not ; for it blew so hard within 
two hours after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of 
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that 
from the north-west, which was against them, that I could not 
suppose their boat could live, or that they ever reached their 
own coast. 

But to return to Friday ; he was so busy about his father, 
that I could not find in my heart to take him off tor some time ; 
but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to 
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the 
highest degree. Then I asked him, if he had given his father 
any bread 1 He shook his head, and said, '< None : ugly dog eat

all up self." So I gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch 
I carried on purpose ; I also gave him a dram for himself; but he 
would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my 
pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him 
a handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his 
father these raisins, than I saw him come out of the boat, and run 
away as if he had been bewitched. He ran at such a rate (for 
he was the swiftest fellow that I ever saw), I say, he ran at such 
•a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, in an instant; and 
though I called and hallooed after him, it was all one ; away he 
went, and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back again, 
though not so fast as he went ; and as he came nearer, I found his 
pace was slacker, because he had something in his hand. 

When he came up to me, I found he had been quite home for 
an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some fresh water; and 
that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread 
he gave me, but the water he carried to his father ; however, as 
I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it ; this water revived 
his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given him ; for 
he was just fainting with thirst. 

When his father had drank, I called to him, to know if there 
was any water left; he said, " Yes;" and I bade him give it to 
the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father ; 
and I sent one of the cakes that Friday brought to the Spaniard 
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon 
a green place, under the shade of a tree. When I saw that upon 
Friday's coming to him with the water he sat up and drank, and 
took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a 
'handful of raisins ; he looked up in my face, with all the tokens 
of gratitude and thankfulness that could appear in any counte- 
nance ; but was so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted him- 
self in the fight, that he could not stand up upon his feet ; he 
tried to do it two or three times, but was really not able, his 
ankles were so swelled and so painful to him ; so I bade him sit 
Btill, and caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with 
rum, as he had done his father's. 

I observed that the poor affectionate creature every two 
minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his 
head about, to see if his father was in the same place and posture 
as he had left him sitting ; and at last he found he was not to be 
seen ; at which he started up, and, without speaking a word, flew 
with that swiftness to him that one could scarce perceive his feet 
o touch the ground as he went ; but when he came, he only found 
he had laid himself down to ease his limbs ; so Friday came back 
to me presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday 
help him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he 
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of 
him. But Friday^ a lusty strong fellow^ took the Spaniard quite 



CH. v. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 145 

up Upon his back, and carried him away to the boat, and set 
him down softly upon the side or gunnel of the canoe, with his 
feet in the inside of it, and then lifted them quite in, and set him 
close to his father, and presently steppinj? out again, launched the 
boat oflP, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk, 
though the wind blew pretty hard too ; so he brought them both 
safe into our creek ; and leaving them in the boat, ran away to 
fetch the other canoe. As he passed me, I spoke to him, and 
asked him, whither he went? He told me, '*Go fetch more 
boat ;" so away he went like the wind ; for sure never man or 
horse ran like him ; and he had the other canoe in the creek 
almost as soon as I got to it by land ; so he wafted me over, and 
then went to help our new guests out of the boat ; but they were 
neither of them able to walk j so that poor Friday knew not 
what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to work in my thought, and calling 
to Friday to bid them sit down on the bank while he came to 
me, I soon made a kind of hand-barrow to lay them on, and 
Friday and 1 carried them up both together upon it between us. 
But when we got them to the outside of our wall or fortification, 
we were at a worse loss than before; for it was impossible to get 
them over ; and I was resolved not to break it down : so I set to 
work again ; and Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made 
a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above that 
with boughs of trees, being in the space without our outward 
fence, and between that and the grove of young wood which I 
had planted ; and here we made them two beds of such things as 
I had ; namely, of good rice-straw, with blankets laid upon it to 
lie on, and another to cover them on each bed. 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very rich 
in subjects ; and it was a merry reflection which I frequently 
made, how like a king I looked. First of all, the whole country 
was my own mere property ; so that I had an undoubted right 
of dominion : secondly, my people were perfectly subjected ; I 
was absolute lord and lawgiver ; they all owed their lives to me, 
and were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occa- 
sion for it, for me. 

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and 
given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to 
think of making some provision for them ; and the first thing I 
did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and 
a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed : when I cut off 
the hinder quarter, and, chopping it into small pieces, I set Fri- 
day to work to boiling and stewing, and thus made them a very 
good dish of flesh and broth. As I cooked it without doors (for 
I made no fire within my inner wall), so I carried it all into the 
new tent ; and having set a table there lor them, I sat down and 
eat my dinner also with them ; and^ as well as I could^ cheered 

o 



146 LIFE AVD ADVENTURES 

them and encouraged them, Friday being my interpreter, especi- 
ally to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too ; for the Span- 
iard spoke the language of the savages pretty well. 

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to 
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our muskets and other 
fire-arms, which for want of time we had left upon the place of 
battle ; and the next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would 
presently be offensive. I also ordered him to bury the horrid 
remains of their barbarous feast, which I could not think of doing 
myself; nay, I could not bear to see them, if I went that way ; 
all which he punctually performed, and removed every trace of 
the savages having been there ; so that when I went again, I 
could scarcely know where it was, otherwise than by the corner 
of the wood pointing to the place. 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two 
new subjects ; and first I set Friday to inquire of his father, what 
he thought of the escape of the savages in that canoe ? and 
whether we might expect a return of them with a power too 
great for us to resist? His first opinion was, that the savages in 
the boat never could live out the storm which blew that night 
they went off, but must of necessity be drowned or driven south 
to those other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured, 
as they were to be drowned if they were cast away ; but as to 
what they would do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew 
not : but it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully fright- 
ened with the manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the 
fire, that he believed they would tell their people they were all 
killed by thunder and lightning, not by the hand of man ; and 
that the two which appeared (namely Friday and I) were two 
spirits or furies come down to destroy them, and not men with 
weapons. This, he said, he knew, because he heard them all cry^ 
out so in their language to one another ; for it was imf>ossible for 
them to conceive that a man should dart fire, and speak thunder, 
and kill at a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done 
now. And this old savage was in the right ; for, as I understood 
since by other hands, ihe savages never attempted to go over to 
the island afterwards. They were so terrified with the accounts 
given by those four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), 
that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island would 
be destroyed with fire from the gods. 

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under continual 
apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, 
I and all my army ; for as we were now four of us, I would have 
ventured upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field at any 
time. 

In a little while, however, no more canoes appearing, the fear 
of their coming wore off, and I began to take my former thoughts 



CH. V. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 147 

of a voyage to tbe main into consideration, being likewise assured 
by Friday's father, that I might depend upon good usage from 
their nation on his account, if I would go. 

But my thoughts were a little suspended when I had a serious 
discourse with the Spaniard, and when I understood that there 
were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portuguese who, having 
been cast away and made their escape to that side, lived there at 
peace indeed with the savages, but were very sorely put to it for 
necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars 
of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship bound from 
the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their 
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring 
back what European goods they could meet with there ; that they 
had five Portuguese seamen on board that they took out of another 
wreck; that ^ve of their own men were drowned when first the 
ship was lost ; and that these escaped through infinite dangers 
and hazards, and arrived almost starved on the cannibal coast, 
where they expected to have been devoured every moment. 

He told me they had some arms with them, but they were 
perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder nor ball, the 
-washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder but a little 
which they used at their first landing to provide themselves some 
food. 

I asked him what he thought would become of them there, 
and if they had formed no design of making any escape. He 
said they had many consultations about it ; but that having neither 
vessel nor tools to build one, nor provisions of any kind, their 
counsels always ended in tears and despair. 

I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal 
from me which might tend towards an escape ; and whether, if 
they were all here, it might not be done. I told him, with freedom, 
that I feared mostly their treachery and ill-usage of me if I put 
my life in their hands ; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue 
in the nature of man, nor did men always square their dealings 
by the obligations they had received, so much as they did by the 
advantages they expected. I told him it would be very hard that 
I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and that they 
should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain, where 
an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what necessity 
or what accident soever brought him thither. I added, that 
otherwise I was persuaded, if they were all here, we might with 
so many hands build a bark large enough to carry us all away 
either to the Brazils southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast 
northward. 

He answered, with a great deal of candour, that their con- 
dition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, that 
he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man un- 
kindly that should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if 



148 . LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I pleased, he would go to tbem with the old man, and discourse 
with them about it, and return a^ain and bring me their answer ; 
that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn oath, 
that they should be absolutely under my direction as their com- 
mander and captain ; and that they should swear upon the Holy 
Gospel to be true to me, and go to such Christian country as that 
I should agree to, and no other ; and to be directed wholly and 
absolutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such 
country as I intended ; and that be would bring a contract from 
them under their hands for that purpose. 

Then he told me he would first swear to me himself, that he 
would never stir from me as long as he lived till I gave him 
orders ; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his 
blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among his 
countrymen. 

He added, they were all of them very civil honest men, and 
they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither 
weapons or clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion 
of the savages; out of all nopes of ever returning to their own 
country ; and that he was sure, if 1 would undertake their relief, 
they would live and die by me. 

Upon these assurances I resolved to venture to relieve them 
if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to 
them to treat ; but when he had got all things m readiness to 
go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much 
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other 
iiand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it, and, by his 
advice, put oflP the deliverance of his comrades for at least half a 
year. The case was thus : 

He had been with us now about a month, during which time 
I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assist- 
ance of Providence, for my support ; and he saw evidently what 
stock of corn and rice I had laid up, which, as it was more than 
enough for myself, so it was not sufficient, at least without good 
husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to four. But 
much less would it be so, if his countrymen, who were, as he 
said, fourteen still alive, should come over ; and least of all would 
it be enough to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a 
voyage to any of the Christian colonies of America. So he told 
me he thought it would be more advisable, to let him and the two 
others dig and cultivate some more land, as much as I could 
spare seed to sow ; and that we should wait another harvest, 
tnat we might have supply of corn for his countrymen when they 
should come ; for want might be a temptation to them to dis- 
agree, or not to think themselves delivered otherwise than out 
of one difficulty into another. " You know," says he, " the chil- 
dren of Israel, though they rejoiced at first at their being de- 
livered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against God Himself, 



CR. y. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 149 

that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the 
wUderness.'' 

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I 
could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as 
I was satisfied with his fidelity : so we all four of us fell to dig- 
ging, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with per- 
mitted ; and in about a month's time, by the end of which it was 
seed-time, we had got as much land cured and trimmed up as we 
sowed twenty-two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice, 
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare ; nor, indeed, 
did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the 
six months that we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckon- 
ing from the time we set our seed aside for sowing ; for it is not 
to be supposed it is six months in the ground in that country. 

Having now society enough, and our number being sufiicient 
to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless 
their number had been very great, we went freely all over the 
island, wherever we found occasion; and as here we had our 
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at 
least for me, to have the means of it out of mind. To this purpose 
1 marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and 
set Friday and his father to cutting them down ; and then I 
caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that 
afifair, to oversee and direct their work; I shewed them with 
what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single 
planks, and I caused them to do the like, till they had made 
aboi:tt a dozen large planks of good oak, nearly two feet broad, 
thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick ; 
what prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine. 

At the same time I laboured to increase my little nock of tame 
goats as much as I could ; and to this purpose I made Friday and 
the Spaniard to ^o out one day, and myself, with Friday, the next 
day, for we took our turns ; and by this means we got above 
twenty young kids to breed up with the rest ; for whenever we 
shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our flock ; 
but above all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I 
caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that 
I believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun 
are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and 
these, with our bread, were a great part of our food. 

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order : it was not 
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but it was 
enousrh to answer our end ; for though all the sixteen Spaniards 
had £een on shore with me, we should have had enough ; or, if 
we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have 
victualled our ship, to have carried us to any part of America. 
When we had housed and secured our magazine of corn, we 
fell to work to make more wicker-work ; namely, great baskets^

150 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 

in which to keep it ; and the Spaniard was very handy and dex- 
terous at this part, and often blamed me, that I did not make 
some things for defence of this kind of work ; but I saw no need 
of it. And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I 
expected, 1 gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to 
see what he could do with those he left behind him there. I gave 
him a strict charge in writing, not to bring any man with him, 
•who would not first swear, in the presence of himself and the old 
savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the 
person he should find in the island, who was so kind to send for 
them in order to their deliverance ; but that they would stand by 
and defend him against all such attempts; and wherever they 
went, would be entirely under and subjected to his commands ; 
and that this should be put in writing, and signed with their 
hands : how we were to have this done, when I knew they had 
neither pen or ink, that, indeed, was a question which we never 
asked. 

Under these instructions, the Spaniard and Friday's father 
went away in one of the canoes, which they might be said to 
come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners 
to be devoured by the savages. 

I gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it, and about 
eight charges of powder and ball; admonishing them to be very 
good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon 
urgent occasions. 

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by 
me for my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some 
days. I gave them provisions of bread and of dried grapes sufii- 
cient for themselves for many days, and sufiicient for their coun- 
trymen for about eight days* time ; and wishing them a good 
voyage, I let them go, agreeing with them about a signal they 
should hang out at their return, by which I should know them 
again, when they came back, at a distance, before they came on 
shore. 

They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon 
was at full ; by my account, in the month of October ; but as for 
an exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could never 
recover it again ; nor had I kept even the number of years so 
punctually as to be sure that I was right, though, as it proved 
when I afterwards examined my account, I had been so.

I sail, as tbey call it, and the wind blow-

they did not come from that side which the shore lay on, but from 
the southernmost end of tbe island. Upon this I called Friday in, 
and bid bina lie close, for these were not the people we looked 
for, and that we did not know yet whether they were friends or

could make of them ; and having taken the ladder out, 1 climbed 
np to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive 
of any tiling, to take my view the plainer without being dis- 
covered. 

I had scarce let my foot on the hill, when I plainly discovered 
a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and a half dis- 
tance from me, s.s.b., but not above a le^ue and a half from 
the shore. By my observation it appeared plainly to bo an Eng- 
lish ship, and the ooat appeared to be an English Ion g-boat. 

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of 



152 LIFB AND ADVRXTURES 

seeing a ship, and one whom I had reason to believe was manned 
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as 
I cannot describe ; but yet some secret doubts hung about me, I 
cannot tell from whence they came, — bidding me keep upon my 
guard. In the first place, it occurred to me to consider what busi- 
ness an English ship could have in that part of the world ; since 
it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the 
English had any traffic ; and I knew there had been no storms 
to drive them in there, as in distress ; and that if they were Eng- 
lish really, it was most probable that they were here upon no 
^ood design ; and that I had better continue as I was, than fall 
into the hands of thieves and murderers. 

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger 
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no 
possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices are af- 
forded us, I believe few that have made any observations of things 
can deny ; that they are discoveries of an invisible world, and a 
converse of spirits, we cannot doubt ; and if the tendency of them 
seems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not suppose they 
are from some friendly agent (whether supreme, or inferior and 
subordinate, is not the question), and that they are given for 
our ffood ? 

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of 
this reasoning ; for had I not been made cautious by this secret 
admonition, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse 
condition than before, as you will see presently. 

I had not kept myself long in this posture, when I saw the 
boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust 
in at for the convenience of landing ; however, as they did not 
come quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I 
formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on shore upon the 
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very happy for 
me ; for otherwise they would have landed just, as I may say, at 
my door, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and, 
perhaps, have plundered me of all I had. 

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were 
Englishmen. There were in all eleven men, whereof three of 
them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought) bound ; and 
when the first four or five of them jumped on shore, they took 
those three out of the boat as prisoners. One of the three I 
could perceive using the most passionate gestures of entreaty, 
affliction, and despair ; the other two lifted up their hands some- 
times, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree 
as the first. 

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what 
the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English, 
as well as he could, " O master! you see English mans eat pri- 
soners as well as savage mans." "Why," said I, "Friday, do 



CH. VI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 153 

VOtt think they are going to eat them, then?" "Yes," says 
Friday, " they will eat them." " No, no," said I, " Friday ;* I 
am afraid they will murder them indeed, but you may be sure 
they will not eat them." 

All this while I had no thought ofwhat the matter really was, 
but stood trembling with horror at the sight, expecting every 
moment when the three prisoners should be killed ; nay, once I 
saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass or 
'Sword, to strike one of the poor men ; at which all the blood in 
my body seemed to run chill in my^ veins. 

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that 
was gone with him ; or that I had any wav to have come un- 
discovered within shot of them, that I might have rescued the 
three men : for I saw no fire-arms they had among them ; but it 
fell out to my mind another way. 

After I had observed the outrageous usa^e of the three men 
by the insolent seamen, I saw that the fellows ran scattering 
about the land, as if they wanted to see the country. I ob- 
served, that the three other men had liberty to go also where they 
pleased ; but they sat down all three upon the ground very pen- 
sive, and looked like men in despair. 

This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore ; 
how I gave myself over for lost, how wildly I looked round me, 
what dreadful apprehensions I had, and how I lodged in the tree 
all night for fear of being devoured by wild beasts. 

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive 
by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land, by the 
storms and tide by which I have since been so long nourished 
and supported ; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing 
how certain of deliverance they were, how near it was to them, 
and how effectually and really they were in a condition of safety, 
at the very time that they thought themselves lost, and their 
case desperate. 

So little do we see before us in the world, and so much rea- 
son have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of all 
things, that He does not leave His creatures so absolutely desti- 
tute, but that in the worst circumstances they have always some- 
thing to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deli- 
verance than they imagine ; nay, are even brought to their 
deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to 
their destruction. 

It was just at the top of high- water when these people came 
on shore ; and partly while they stood parleying with the prison- 
ers they brought, and partly while they rambled about to see 
what kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly stayed till 
the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, 
leaving their boat aground. 

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found after- 



154 LIFE AND ADYBNTURES 

wards, havhiff drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep ; how- 
ever, one of them waking sooner than the other, and finding the 
boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed for the rest who 
were straggling about, upon which they all soon came to the 
boat ; but it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat 
being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy 
sand, almost like a quicksand. 

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps, the 
least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and 
away they strolled about the country again ; and I heard one of 
them say aloud to another (calling them off from the boat), 
" Why let her alone. Jack, can't ye ? she'll float next tide." By 
which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what coun- 
trymen they were. 

All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to 
stir out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observa- 
tion, near the top of the hill ; and very glad I was, to think how 
well it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before 
the boat could be afloat again, and by that time it would be 
dark, and I might be more at liberty to see their motions, and to 
hear their discourse, if they had any. 

In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, 
though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another 
kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom 
1 had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself 
with arms. I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him 
three muskets. My figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I had my 
formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have men- 
tioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a 
gun upon each shoulder. 

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any 
attempt till it was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the heat 
of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling into the 
woods, and, as I thought, were lain down to sleep; the three 
poor distressed men, too anxious for their condition to get any 
sleep, were set down under the shelter of a great tree, at about 
a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of sight of 
any of the rest. 

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn 
something of their condition. Immediately I marched in the 
guise as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind me, 
as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring 
a spectre- like figure as I did. 

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before 
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, <' What 
are ye, gentlemen?" 

They started up at the noise ; but were ten times more con- 
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth appearance that I

made. They made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived 
them just going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in Eng- 
lish. ** Gentlemen," said I, ^' do not be surprised at me : per- 
haps you may have a friend near you, when you did not expect 
if " He must be sent directly from Heaven, then," said one 
of them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same 
time to me, ** for our condition is past the help of man." " All 
help is from Heaven, sir," said I ; " but can you put a stranger 
in the way how to help you ? for you seem to me to be in some 
great distress. I saw you when you landed ; and when you 
seemed to make application to the brutes that came with you, I 
saw one of them lift up his sword to kill you." 

The poor man, with tears running down bis face, and trem- 
bling, looking like one astonished, returned, '* Am I talking 
to God or man? Is it a real man, or an angel?" ^* Be in no 
fear about that, sir," said I ; ^Mf God had sent an angel to re- 
lieve you, he would have come better clothed, and armed after 
another manner than you see me in ; pray lay aside your fears ; 
I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you ; you see 
I have one servant only ; we have arms and ammunition ; tell us 
freely, can we serve you? what is your case?" 

" Our case," said he, " sir, is too long to tell you, while our 
murderers are so near ; but in short, sir, I was commander of 
that ship; my men have mutinied against me, thev have been 
hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and at last nave set me 
on shore in this desolate place, with these two men with me, 
one my mate, the other a passenger ; where we expected to 
perish, believing the place to be unmhabited ; and we Know not 
yet what to think of it." 

"Where are those brutes, your enemies?" said I; '^doyoa 
know where they are gone?" ** There they lie, sir," said he, 
pointing to a thicket of trees ; " my heart trembles for fear they 
nave seen us, and heard you speak ; if they have, they will cer- 
tainly murder us all." 

** Have they any fire-arms?" said I: he answered, they had 
only two pieces, and one whieh they left in the boat. ** Well, 
then," said I, '^ leave the rest to me ; I see they are all asleep ; 
it is an easy thing to kill them all ; but shall we rather take 
them prisoners?" He told me there were two desperate vil- 
lains among them that it was scarce safe to shew any mercy 
to ; but if they were secured, he believed all the rest would 
return to their duty. I asked him, which they were. He 
told me, he could not at that distance describe them; but he 
■would obey my orders in any thing I would direct. " Well," 
said I, **let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they 
awake, and we will resolve further." So they wiUingly went 
back with me, till the woods covered us from them. 

*' Look you, sir," said I ; *' if I venture upon your deliver-

ance, are you willing to make two conditions with me?'' He 
anticipated my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the 
ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and commanded 
by me in every thing ; and if the ship was not recovered, be 
would live and die with me in what part of the world soever I 
would send him ; and the two other men said the same. 

" Well," said I, "my conditions are but two : first, that while 
you stay on this island with me, you will not pretend to any 
authority here ; and if I put arms into your hands, you will 
upon all occasions give them up to me, and do no prejudice to 
me or mine upon this island, and in the mean time be governed 
by my orders. Second, that if the ship is, or may be recovered, 
you will carry me and my man to England, passage free." 

He gave me all the assurance that the invention and faith of 
man could devise, that he would comply with these most reason- 
able demands ; and besides, would owe his life to me, and ac- 
knowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived. 

** Well, then," said I, " here are three muskets for you, with 
powder and ball ; tell me next what yoji think is proper to be 
done." He shewed all the testimony of his gratitude that he 
was able, but oflPered to be wholly guided by me ; I told him, I 
thought it was hard venturing any thing, but the best method I 
could think of was, to fire upon them at once, as they lay ; and if 
any were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we 
might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence 
to direct the shot. 

He said, very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if lie 
could help it ; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and 
had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they 
escaped, we should be undone still ; for they would go on board, 
and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. " Well, 
then," said I, " necessity legitimates my advice ; for it is the only 
way to save our lives." However, seeing him still cautious of 
shedding blood, I told him, they should go themselves, and 
manage as they found convenient. 

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, 
and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him, 
" If either of them were the men who he had said were the heads 
of the mutiny ?" He said, " No." " WeU, then," said I, " you 
may let them escape, and Providence seems to have wakened 
them on purpose to save themselves. Now," said I, " if the rest 
escape you, it is your fault." . 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in 
his hand, and pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, 
with each man a piece in his hand. The two men, who were with 
him, going first, made some noise; at which one of the seamen, 
who was awake, turned about, and seeing them coming, cried out 
to the rest^'but it was too late then j for the moment he cried 



CH. VI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 157 

out, the captain's companions fired, he wisely reserving his own 
piece. They had so well aimed their shot at the men they knew, 
that one of them was killed on the spot, and the other very much 
wounded ; hut not being dead, he started up upon his feet, and 
called eagerly for help to the other ; but the captain, stepping to 
him, told him it was too late to cry for help, he should call upon 
God to forgive his villany ; and with that word knocked him 
down with the stock of his musket, so that he never spoke more. 
There were three more in the company, and one of them was also 
slightlv wounded. By this time I was come ; and when they saw 
their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begged for 
mercy. The captain told them he would spare their lives, if they 
would give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery 
they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him 
in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to 
Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave him all the pro- 
testations of their sincerity that could be desired ; and he was 
willing to believe them and spare their lives, which I did not 
oppose ; only I desired him to keep them bound hand and foot 
while they were upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate 
to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars 
and sail, which they did ; and by and by, three straggling men, 
that were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back 
upon hearing the guns fired ; and seeing their captain, who be- 
fore was their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to 
be bound also, and so our victory was complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into 
one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my 
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze- 
ment, and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being 
furnished with provisions and ammunition ; and indeed as my 
story was a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply ; 
but when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I 
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, 
the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more. 

After this communication was at an end, I carried him and 
his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I 
came out, viz. at the top of the house, where I refreshed them 
with such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the contriv- 
ances i had made during my long residence in that place. 

All I shewed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing ; 
but above all, the captain admired ray fortification; and how 
perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which, 
having now been planted nearly twenty years, and the trees grow- 
ing much faster than in England, was become a little wood, and 
so thick that it was impassable in any part of it, but at that 
one side where I had reserved my little winding passage into it« 

p 



158 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

I told him this was my castle and my residence, but that I had 
a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could 
retreat upon occasion, and I would shew him that too another 
time ; but at present our business was to consider how to recover 
the ship. He agreed with me as to that ; but told me he was 
perfectly at a loss what measures to take, for that there were 
still six-and-twenty hands on board, who having entered into a 
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the 
law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would 
carry it on, knowing that if they were overcome they should be 
brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England, or to 
any of the English colonies, and that therefore there would be 
no attacking them with so small a number as we were. 

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it 
was a very rational conclusion ; and that therefore something was 
to be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw the men on board 
into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their landing 
upon us, and destroying us. It presently occurred to me, that 
in a little while the ship's crew, wondering what was become 
of their comrades and of the boat, would certainly come on shore 
in their other boat to look after them $ and that then, perhaps, 
they might come armed, and be too strong for us : this he al- 
lowed was reasonable. 

Upon this I told him, the first thing we were to do was, to 
stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they might not 
carry her off; and taking every thing out of her, leave her so 
far useless as not to be nt to float ; accordingly, we went on 
board, took the arms, and whatever else we found there, which 
was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, 
a horn of powder, and a great lump of su^ar in a piece of canvass ; 
the sugar was five or six pounds ; all which was very welcome to 
me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which 1 had had none left 
for many years. 

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, 
sail, and rudder of the boat having been carried away before), 
we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had come 
strong enough to master us, yet they could not carry off the 
boat. 

Indeed it was not much in my thoughts that we should be 
able to recover the ship ; but my view was, that if they went 
away without the boat, I did not much question to make her fit 
a^ain to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our 
friends, the Spaniards, in my way ; for I had them still in my 
thoughts. 

While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by 
main strength, heaved the boat up upon the beach, so high that 
the tide would not float her off at high -water mark, and, besides, 
2jad broken a hole in her bottom, too big to be quickly stopped^ 



CH. VI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 159 

and were sat down musing what we should do^ we heard the ship 
iire a gun, and saw her make a waft with her ancient, as a signsil 
for the boat to come on board ; but no boat stirring, they tired 
leveral times, making other signals for her return. 

At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless, and 
they found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the help of 
my glasses) hoist another boat out and row towards the shore ; 
and we found, as they approached, that there were no less than 
ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms with them. 

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a 
fiill view of them as they came, and a plain sight of the men, 
even of their faces ; because, the tide having set them a little to 
the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come 
to the same place where the other had landed, and where the 
boat lay. 

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the 
captam knew the persons and characters of all these individuals ; 
of whom, he said, that there were three very honest fellows, who, 
he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being 
overpowered and frightened. But that as for the boatswain, 
who, it seems, was the chief ofiicer among them, and all the rest, 
they were as outrageous as any of the ship's crew, and were, no 
doubt, made desperate in their new enterprise ; and terribly ap- 
prehensive he was, that they would be too powerful for us. 

I smiled at him, and told him that men in our circumstances 
were past the operation of fear. I asked him, too, what he 
thought of the events of my life, and whether a deliverance was 
not worth venturing for ? " And where, sir," said I, *•' is your 
belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your life, 
which elevated you a little while ago ? For my part," I added, 
** there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it." 
« What is that ?" says he. " Why," said I, '* it is that, as you 
say, there are three or four honest fellows among them, which 
should be spared ; had they been all of the wicked part of the 
crew, I should have thought God's providence had singled them 
out to deliver them into your hands ; for, depend upon it, every 
man of them that comes ashore is our own, and shall die or 
live as they behave to us." 

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, 
I found it greatly encouraged him ; so we set vigorously to our 
business. We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's com- 
ing from the ship, resolved upon separating the prisoners, and 
had, indeed, secured them efiectually. 

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured, I sent 
with Friday, and one of the three (delivered men) to my cave, 
where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being 
heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods, 
if they could have delivered themselves : here they left them 



1 60 LIFB AND ADVENTURES 

bound, but gave them provisioiis, and promised them, if they 
continued there quietly, to give them their liberty in a day or 
two ; but that it' they attempted their escape, they should be 
put to death without mercy. They promised faithfully to bear 
their confinement with patience, and were very thankful that 
they had such good usage as to have provisions and a light 
left them ; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made our- 
selves) for their comfort ; and they did not know but that he 
stood sentinel over them at the entrance. 

The other prisoners had better usage ; two of them were kept 
pinioned indeed, because the captain could not trust them ; but 
the other two were taken into my service upon their captain's 
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and 
die with us ; so, with them and the three honest men, we were 
seven men well armed ; and I made no doubt we should be able 
to deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering 
that the captain had said there were three or four honest men 
among them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay, 
they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling 
the boat up after them, which I was glad to see ; for I was afraid 
they would rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance 
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her ; and so we 
should not be able to seize the boat. 

Being on shore, the first thing they did was to run to the 
other boat ; and it was easy to see they were greatly surprised 
to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a hole 
in her bottom. 

After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or 
three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they 
could make their companions hear ; but all to no purpose ; then 
they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small 
arms, which made the woods ring ; but it was all one : those in 
the cave, we were sure, could not hear ; and those in our keep- 
ing, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no answer 
to them. 

They were so astonished at all this, that, as they told us after- 
wards, they resolved to go all on board again to their ship, and 
let them know there that the men were all murdered, and the 
long-boat staved ; accordingly, they immediately launched the 
boat again, and got all of them on board. 

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at 
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set 
sail, giving their comrades up for lost, and so he should still lose 
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered ; but 
he was quickly as much alarmed the other way. 

They had not been long put off with the boat, than we per- 
celred them all coming on shore again ) but with this new

measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they consulted to- 
gether upon, namely, to leave three men in the boat, and the 
rest to go on shore^ and go up into the country to look for 
their fellows. 

This was a great disappointment to us ; for now we were at a 
loss what to do ; for our seizing these seven men on shore would 
be no advantage to us if we let the boat escape, because they 
would then row away to the ship ; and then the rest of them 
would be sure to weigh, and set sail^ and so our chance of reco- 
vering the ship would be lost. 

However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the 
issue of things might present : the seven men came on shore, 
and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good 
distance from the land, and came to an anchor to wait for them ; 
so that it was impossible for us to come at them. 

Those that came on shore kept close together, marching 
towards the top of the little hill under which my habitation 
lay ; and we could see them plainly, though they could not per- 
ceive us : we should have been very glad if they would have 
come nearer to us, so that we might have fired at them ; or that 
they would have gone farther off, that we might have come 
ftbroad. 

But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they 
could see a great way in the valley and woods, which lay towards 
the north-east part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted 
and hallooed till they were weary ; and not caring, it seems^ to 
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat 
down together under a tree, to consider of it. Had they thought 
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of them had 
done, they had done the job for us ; but they were too full of 
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they 
could not tell what the danger was they had to fear. 

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con- 
sultation of theirs ; namely, that ptThaps they would all fire a 
volley aeain, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that 
we should all sally upon them, just at the juncture when their 
pieces were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and 
we should have them wirhout bloodshed. I liked tne proposal, 
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to 
them before they could load their pieces again. 

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time, 
very irresolute what course to take ; at length 1 told them that, 
in ray opinion, there was nothing to be done till night ; and then, 
it they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way 
to get between them and the shore, and so might use some strata- 
gem with them in the boat to get them on shore. 

We waited a great while, though very impatient for their 
removing, and were very uneasy ; when, after long consultations, 

p2 



162 LIFB AND ADVENTUBES 

we saw them all start up, and march down toward the sea : it 
seems they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the 
danger of the place, that they resolved to go ou board the ship 
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with 
their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined 
it to be as it really was ; that they had given over their search, 
and were for goin^ back again ; and the captain, as soon as I 
told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of 
it ; but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back 
again, and which answered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little 
creek westward, towards the place where the savages came on 
shore when Friday was rescued ; and as soon as they came to a 
little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, to halloo as 
loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard 
them ; as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, to 
return it again, and tfa^n, keeping out of sight, take a round, 
always answering when the others hallooed, to draw them as 
far into the island, and among the woods, as possible, and then 
wheel about again to me, by such ways as 1 directed them. 

They were just going mto the boat, when Friday and the 
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answering 
ran along the shore westward towards the voice they heard, 
when they were presently stopped by the creek, where, the 
water being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat 
to come up and carry them over, as indeed I expected. 

When they had crossed over, I observed that the boat being 
gone up a good way into the creek, and as it were in a harbour 
within the land, they took one of the three men out of her to go 
along with them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened 
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. 

This was what I wished for ; and immediately leaving Friday 
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me, 
and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two 
men before they were aware, one of them lying on shore, and 
the other being in the boat ; the fellow on shore was between 
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the captain, who 
was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and 
then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead 
man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a single man 
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade 
knocked down ; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three 
that were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, 
and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but after- 
wards to join very sincerely with us. 

In the mean time^ Friday and the captain's mate so well 



CH. VI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 1G3 

managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by 
hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from 
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but 
left them where they were very sure they could not return to 
the boat before it was dark ; and, indeed, they were heartily 
tired themselves also by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, 
and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them. 

It was several hours after Friday came back to me before 
they returned to their boat ; and we could hear the foremost 
of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those be- 
hind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and 
complain how lame and tired they were, and that they were 
not able to come any faster ; — all which was very welcome newt 
to us. 

At length they came up to the boat ; but it is impossible to 
express their confusion, when they found the boat fast a-ground 
in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone. We 
could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable man* 
ner, telling one another they were ^ot into an enchanted island ; 
that either there were inhabitants m it, and they should all be 
murdered ; or else there were devils or spirits m it, and they 
should be all carried away and devoured. 

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their 
names a great many times, but leceived no answer : after some 
time, we could see them, by the little light there was, run about 
wringing their hands, like men in despair ; and that sometimes 
they would go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then 
come ashore again, and walk about, and so the same thing over 
again. 

My men would fain have had me given them leave to fall 
upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing to take them 
at some advantage, so as to slay as few of them as I could ; and, 
especially, I was unwilling to hazard the killing any of our own 
men, knowing the others were very well armed : I therefore 
resolved to wait to see if they did not separate ; and to make 
sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer ; and ordered Fri- 
day and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet, as close 
to the ground as they could, that they mi^rht not be discovered, 
and get as near them as they possibly could before they offered 
to lire. 

They had not been long in that posture before the boatswain, 
who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now 
shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, 
came walking towards them with two more of the crew. The 
captain was so eager, at having this principal rogue so much 
in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him 
come so near as to be sure of him ; for they only heard his 



164 LIFE AND AOVSNTUBES

tongue before: but when they came nearer, the captain and 
Friday, starting upon their feet, let fly at them. 

The boatswain was killed upon the spot ; the next man was 
shot in the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die till 
an hour or two after ; and the third ran for it. 

At the noise of the fire, 1 immediately advanced with my 
whole army, which was now eight men ; viz. myself, general- 
issimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general ; the captain and his two 
men, and the three prisoners of war, that we had trusted with 
arms. 

We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could 
not see our number ; and I made the man they had left in the 
boat, who was now one of us, call them by name, to try if 
I could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps reduce 
them to terms ; which fell out just as we desired ; for, indeed, 
it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they would be 
very willing to capitulate ; so he called out, as loud as he could, 
to one of them, "Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered imme- 
diately, "Who's that? Robinson?" For it seems he knew his 
voice. The other answered, " Ay, ay ; for God*s sake, Tom 
Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead 
men this moment." 

"Who must we yield to? Where are they?" says Smith 
again. " Here they are," says he : " here is our captain and 
fifty men with him, have been hunting you this two hours : the 
boatswain is killed ; Will Frye is wounded, and I am a pri- 
soner ; and if you do not yield, you are all lost." 

"Will they give us quarter, then?" said Tom Smith, "and 
we will yield." " I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield," 
says Robinson. So he asked the captain, and the captain him- 
self then called out ; *' You, Smith, you know my voice ; if you 
lay down your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have 
your lives, all but Will Atkins." 

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, " For God's sake, captain, 
give me quarter : what have I done ? they have been all as bad 
as I" (which, by the way, was not true ; for it seems this Will 
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, 
and giving him injurious language) : however, the captain told 
him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust the 
mercy of the governor ; for such they all called me. 

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their 
lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and 
two more, who bound them all ; and then my great army of 
fifty men, which, with those three, were in all but eight, came up 
and seized upon them all and upon their boat, only that I kept 
myself and one more out of sight, for reasons of state. 

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing 



Aat they should not stir any where bat by my direction ; that 
if they aid, ttaey should be fetched iuto the castle, and be laid in 
irana ; bo that, as we never suffered them to see me as governor, 
■o I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, 
the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty, hut to furnish bis two 
boats, stop the breach of one, and man them ; he made hia pas* 
•enger captain of one, with four oiher men ; and himself, and 
hu mate, and five more, went in the other ; and they contrived 
their business very well ; for they came up to the ship about 
midni^t. As soon aa they came within call of the ship, he 
made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off 
the men and the boat, hut that it was a long time before thejr 
had found them, and the like ; holding them in a chat, till they 
came to the ship's side ; when the captain and the mate, enter- 
ing first with their arms, immediately knocked down the second 
mate and carpenter with the butt-end of their muskets. Being 
Tery faithfully seconded by their men, they secured all the rest 
titat were upon the main and quarter-decks, and tiegftn to fasten 
the hatches to keep them down who were below, when the other 
bont, and their men, entering at the fore-chaina, secured the 
forecastle of the ship, and the skuttle which went down into the 
MdE-room, making the three men they found there prisoners. 

When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain or- 
dered the mate wiih three men to break into the round-honse, 
where the new rebel captain lay, and, having taken the alarm, 
liad got up, and, with two men and a boy, had seized some fire- 
arms ; and when the mate with a. crow-bar split open the door, 
the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and 
wounded the mate with a musket-ball, which broke hia arm, 
and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody. 

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the roand- 
bonse, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new 
captain through the head, the bnllet entering at his month, and 
coming out again behind one of hia ears ; so that he never spoka 
a word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken

Our next work was to repair the boat^ and to think of seizing 



CH. VI. 07 ROBINSON CRUSO£. 165 

the ship ; and as for the captain, now that he had leisure to 
parley with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany 
of their practices, and how certainly it must bring them to 
misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows. 

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their 
lives. As for that, he told them they were no prisoners of his, 
bat of the commander of the island ; that they thought they 
had set him on shore in a barren uninhabited island ; but it had 
pleased God so to direct them, that the island was inhabited, 
and that the governor was an Englishman ; that he might hang 
them all there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them aU 
quarter, he supposed he would send them to England, to be 
dealt with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was 
commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death ; for 
that he would be hanged in the morning. 

Though this was all an invention of his own, yet it had the 
desired effect : Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to 
intercede with the governor for his life ; and all the rest begged 
of him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was 
come, and that it would be an easy thing to bring these fellows 
to be hearty in getting possession of the ship ; so I retired in the 
dark from them, that they might not see what kind of a gover- 
nor they bad, and called the captain to me ; when I called, as at 
a good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again, and 
say to the captain, " Captain, the commander calls for you :" 
and presently the captain replied, " Tell his excellency I am just 
a coming." This more perfectly deceived them ; and they all 
believed that the commander was just by, with his fifty men. 

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project for 
seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully well, and resolved 
to put in execution the next morning. 

But, in order to effect it with more art and certainty of 
success, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he 
should go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, 
and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay : this 
was committed to Friday, and the two men who came on shore 
with the captain. 

They conveved them to the cave, as to a prison ; and it was 
indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition. The 
other I ordered to my bower ; and as it was fenced in, and they 
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were 
upon their behaviour. 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter 
into a parley with them : in a word, to try them, and tell me, 
whether he thought they might be trusted to ^o on board, and 
surprise the ship : he talked to them of the injury done him, of 
the condition they were brought to ; «uid that, though the go- 



162 LIFB AND ADVBNTUBES 

we saw them all start up, and march down toward the sea : it 
seems they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the 
danger of the place, that they resolved to go ou board the ship 
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with 
their intended voyage with the ship. 

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined 
it to be as it really was ; that they had given over their search, 
and were for going back again ; and the captain, as soon as I 
told him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of 
it ; but I presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back 
again, and which answered my end to a tittle. 

I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go over the little 
creek westward, towards the place where the savages came on 
shore when Friday was rescued ; and as soon as they came to a 
little rising ground, at about half a mile distance, to halloo as 
loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard 
them ; as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, to 
return it again, and tfa^n, keeping out of sight, take a round, 
always answering when the others hallooed, to draw them as 
far into the island, and among the woods, as possible, and then 
wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed them. 

They were just going mto the boat, when Friday and the 
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answering 
ran along the shore westward towards the voice they heard, 
when they were presently stopped by the creek, where, the 
water being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat 
to come up and carry them over, as indeed I expected. 

When they had crossed over, I observed that the boat being 
gone up a good way into the creek, and as it were in a harbour 
within the land, they took one of the three men out of her to go 
along with them, and left only two in the boat, having fastened 
her to the stump of a little tree on the shore. 

This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday 
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the rest with me, 
and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two 
men before they were aware, one of them lying on shore, and 
the other being in the boat; the fellow on shore was between 
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the captain, who 
was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and 
then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead 
man. 

There needed very few arguments to persuade a single man 
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade 
knocked down ; besides, this was, it seems, one of the three 
that were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, 
and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but after- 
wards to join very sincerely with us. 

In the mean time^ Fnday and the captain's mate so well 



CH. VI. OF BOBINSON CSUSOE. 163 

managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by 
hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from 
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but 
left them where they were very sure they could not return to 
the boat before it was dark ; and, indeed, they were heartily 
tired themselves also by the time they came back to us. 

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, 
and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them. 

It was several hours after Friday came back to me before 
they returned to their boat ; and we could hear the foremost

The boatswain was killed upon the spot ; the next man was

to some other monastery or religious house, amounted to above 
two hundred moidores a-year : that as to my being restored to 
a quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that, 
my partner being alive to witness ray title, and my name being 
also enrolled in the register of the country. Also he told me, 
that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair honest 
people, and very wealthy, and he believed I would not only 
have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would 
find a very considerable sum of money in their hands for my 
account, being the produce of the farm while their fathers held 
the trust, and before it was given up as above, which, as he 
remembered, was for about twelve years. 

I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, 
and inquired of the old captain, how it came to pass that the 
trustees should thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I 
had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain, 
my universal heir, &c. 

He told me, that was true ; but that, as there was no proof 
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some cer- 
tain account should come of mv death : and that, besides, he was 
not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote : that it was 
true, he had registered my will, and put in his claim ; and could 
be have given any account of my being dead or alive, he would 
have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio 
(so they call the sugar-house), and had given his son, who was 
-now at the Brazils, order to do it. 

" But," said the old man, " I have one piece of news to tell 
you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest ; 
and that is, that believing you were lost, and all the world be- 
lieving so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account to 
me in your name, for six or eight of the first years of profits, 
which I received ; but there being at that time," says he, " great 
disbursements, for increasing the works, building an ingenio, 
and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as after- 
wards It produced ; however," added he, " I shall give you a 
true account of what I have received in all, and how 1 have dis- 
posed of it." 

After a few days* further conference with this ancient friend, 
he brought me an account of the first six years' income of my 
plantation, signed by my partner and the merchants trustees, 
being always delivered in goods, namely, tobacco in roll, and 
sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c., which is the conse- 
quence of a sugar-work ; and I found by this account that every 
year the income considerably increased, but, as above, the dis- 
bursement being large, the sum at first was small. However, the 
old man let me see that he was debtor to me 470 moidores of 
gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen double rolls of to- 
bacco, which were lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked 



CH. Til. OF K0BIN80N CBUSOB. 175 

coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the 
place. 

The ffood man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and 
how he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover his 
losses, and buy him a share in a new ship. '* However, my old 
friend," said he, " you shall not want a supply in your necessity ; 
and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully satisfied." 

Upon this he pulled out an old pouch, and ^ave me 160 Por- 
tugal moidores in gold ; and giving me the writing of his title to 
the ship which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of which he was 
a quarter part owner and his son another, he put them both in my 
hands for security of the rest. 

I was too much moved with the honestv and kindness of the 
poor man to be able to bear this ; and remembering what he had 
done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how generously 
he had used me on all occasions, and particularly how sincere a 
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping at what 
he said to me. I therefore asked him first if his circumstances 
admitted him to spare so much money at that time, and if it 
would not straiten him? He told me he could not say but it 
mieht straiten him a little ; but, nevertheless, it was my money, 
and I might want it more than he. 

Every thing the good man said was full of affection, and I 
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, I took 
one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give 
him a receipt for them ; then I returned him the rest, and told 
him, if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would return the 
others to him also, as indeed I afterwards did ; and that, as to the 
bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would not take it by any 
means, but that if 1 wanted the money, I found he was honest 
enough to pay me ; and if I did not, but came to receive what he 
cave me reason to expect, I would never have a penny more from 
him. 

When this was passed, the old man asked me if he should 

Eut me in a way to make my claim to my plantation. I told 
im I thought to ^o over to it myself. He said I might do so 
if I pleased ; but that if I did not, there were modes enough to 
secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits to 
my use. And as there were ships in the river of Lisbon just 
ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a 
public register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that I was 
alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for 
the planting the said plantation at first. 

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration 
affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of his writing, to 
a merchant of his acquaintance at the place ; and then proposed 
my staying with him till an account came of the return. 

Never any thing was more honourable than the proceedings 



176 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

Upon this procuration ; for in less than seven months I received a 
large packet from the survivors of my trustees (for they were 
both dead), in which were the following particular letters and 
papers enclosed : 

First, there was the account current of the produce of my farm, 
or plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with 
my old Portugal captain, being for six years : the balance ap- 
peared to be 1174 moidores in my favour. 

Secondly, there was the account of four years more while they 
kept the e£^cts in their hands, before the government claimed the 
administration as being the effects of a person not to be found, 
which they called " civil death ;" and the balance of this, the 
value of the plantation increasing, amounted to about 3241 
moidores. 

Thirdly, there was the prior of the Augustines' account, who 
had received the profits for above fourteen years ; but not being 
to account for what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly 
declared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he acknow- 
ledged to my account. As to the king's part, that refunded 
nothing. 

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very 
affectionately upon my being alive ; giving me an account how 
the estate was improved and what it produced a year, with a 

Particular of the number of squares or acres that it contained, 
ow planted, how many labourers there were upon it, and in- 
viting me very passionately to come over and take possession of 
my own, and in the mean time to give him orders to whom he 
should deliver my effects if I did not come myself; concluding 
with a hearty tender of his friendship and that of his family ; and 
sent me as a present seven fine leopards' skins, which he had, it 
seems, received from Africa by some other ship which he had sent 
thither, and which had apparently made a better voyage than I. 
He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred 
pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. 

By the same fleet my two merchant- trustees shipped me 1200 
chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole 
account in gold. 

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was 
better than the beginning. It is impossible to express here the 
fiutterings of my very heart when I looked over these letters, and 
especially when I found all my wealth about me ; for as the Brazil 
ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters 
brought my goods, and the effects were safe in the river before the 
letter came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale and grew sick ; 
and had not the old man run and fetched me a cordial, I believe 
the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature^ and I had died 
upon the spot. 

I was now master^ all on a sudden, of above 6000/. sterling in 



CH. VII. OF ROBINSON CBU80B. 177 

jnoney, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils 
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in 
England ; and in [short, I was in a condition which I scarcely 
knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the 
enjoyment of it. 

The first thing I did was to recompense my original bene- 
factor, my good md captain, who had been first charitable to me 
in my distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at 
the end. I shewed him all that was sent me ; I told him that, 
next to the proyidence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it 
was owing to him ; and that it now lay on me to reward him, 
which I would do a hundred-fold So I first returned to him the 
hundred moidores I had received of him ; then 1 sent for a notary, 
and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge for the 
470 moidores which he had acknowledged he owed me, in the 
fullest and firmest manner possible ; after which I caused a pro- 
curation to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the 
annual profits of my plantation, and appointed my partner to ac- 
count to him, and make the returns by the usual fleets to him in 
my name ; and a clause in the end, bemg a grant of one hundred 
moidores a year to him during his life out ot the effects, and fifty 
moidores a year to his son after him for his life. 

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next, and 
what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put into my 
hands ; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head now than I 
had in my silent state of life in the island, where I wanted nothing 
but what I had, and had nothing but what I wanted ; whereas I 
had now a great charge upon me, and my business was how to 
secure it. I had neither a cave to hide my money in, nor a place 
where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew rusty and 
tarnished before any body would meddle with it. On the con- 
trary, I knew not where to put it, or who to trust with it ; my old 
patron, the captain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only 
refuge I had. 

In the next place, my interest in the Brazils seemed to summon 
me thither ; but now I oould not think of going thither till I had 
settled my affairs, and left my effects in some safe hands behind 
me. At first I thought of my old friend the widow, who, I knew, 
was honest and would be just to me ; but then she was in years 
and but poor, and, for aueht I knew, might be in debt ; so that, 
in a word, I had no way but to go back to England myself, and 
take my effects with me. 

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; 
and therefore, as I had rewarded the old captain, who had been mr 
former benefactor, fully and to his satisfaction, so I began to think 
of my poor widow, whose husband had been my first benefactor, 
and she, while it was in her power, my faithful steward and in- 
structor. So the first thing I did was, to get a merchant in Lisbon 



178 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

to write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay a bill, 
but to go and find ber out, and carry ber in money a hundred 
pounds from me, and to talk with ber, and comfort her in her 
poverty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further 
supply. At the same time I sent my two sisters in the country 
each of them a hundred pounds, they being, though not in want, 
yet not in very good circumstances; one having been marriefl, 
and left a widow ; and the other having a husband not so kind to 
her as he should be. But among all my relations or acquaint- 
ances I could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the 
gross of my stock ; and this greatly perplexed me. I had once a 
mind to have gone to the Brazils, and have settled myself there, 
for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place ; but I now thought 
rather of disposing of my property there, more especially as I 
really did not know with whom to leave my eifects behind me. 
So I resolved at last to so to England with them, where, if I 
arrived, I concluded I should make some acquaintance, or find 
some relations, that would be faithful to me ; and accordingly I 
prepared to return to England with all my wealth. 

And, first, to the prior of St. Augustine I wrote a letter 
full of thanks for his just dealings, and the ofier of the 872 moi- 
dores which was undisposed of, and which I desired might be 
given, 600 to the monastery, and 872 to the poor, as the prior 
should direct, desiring the good padre's prayers for me, and 
the like. 

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the 
acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for ; as 
for sending them any present, they were far above having any 
occasion for it. 

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in 
the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the 
stock of the works, giving him instructions for his future govern- 
ment of my part, according to the powers I had left with my old 
patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became due to 
me till be should hear from me more particularly, assuring him 
that it was my intention not only to come to him, but to settle 
myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I added a 
very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two 
daughters, for such the captain's son informed me he had; with 
two pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get in 
Lisbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a 
good value. 

Having thus settled my afiairs, sold my cargo, and turned all 
my efiects into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was 
which way to go to England. I had been accustomed enough to 
the sea, and yet I had a strange dislike to go by it at that time ; 
and though I could give no reason for it, yet the aversion in- 
creased upon me so much, that though I had once shipped my 



CH. VII. OF ROBINSON CEUSOEr 179 

baggage, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but two or 
three times. 

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to 
whom 1 communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to 
go by water ; but either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross 
over the Bay of Biscay to Rochelle, from whence it was but an 
easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and 
Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land 
through France. 

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at 
all, except from Calais to Dover, that 1 resolved to travel all the 
way by land ; which, as I was not in haste and did not value the 
charge, was by much the pleasanter way ; and to make it more 
so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of a 
merchant in Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me. After 
which we picked up two more English merchants also, and two 
young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Paris only ; so 
that we were in all six of us and ^ve servants, the two merchants 
and the two Portuguese contenting themselves with one servant 
between two to save the charge ; and as for me, I got an English 
sailor to travel with me as a servant besides my man Friday, who 
was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of 
a servant on the road. 

In this manner I set out from Lisbon ; and our company being 
all very well mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof 
they did me the honour to call me captain, as well because I was 
the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and indeed was the 
originator of the whole journev. 

When we came to MadriS we, being all of us strangers to 
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of that 
country, and what was worth observing ; but it being the latter 
part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid 
about the middle of October. But when we came to the edge 
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the way, with 
an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of 
the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back 
to Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to 
pass on. 

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed ; 
and to me that had been always used to a hot climate, and in- 
deed to countries where we could scarcely bear any clothes on, 
the cold was insufferable ; nor, indeed, was it more painful than 
it was surprising, to come but ten days before out of the Old 
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot, 
and immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean mountains, so 
very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger 
the benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toes. 

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the moun- 



180 LIFB AND ADVBNTUBES 

tains all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had 
never seen or felt before in his life. 

To mend the matter, after we came to Pampeluna, it con- 
tinued snowing with so much violence, and so long, that the 
people said, winter was come before its time ; and the roads, 
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable. We 
stayed no less than twenty days at Pampeluna; when (seeing the 
winter coming on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it 
was the severest winter all over Europe that had been known 
in the memory of man) I proposed that we should all go away 
to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was 
a very little voyage. 

But while we were considering this, there came in four French 
gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the 
passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, 
traversing the country near the head of Languedoc, had brought 
them over the mountains by such ways, that they were not much 
incommoded with the snow : and where they met with snow in 
any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them 
and their horses. 

We sent for this guide, who told us he would undertake to 
carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided 
we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts ; 
for, he said, upon these great snows, it was common for some 
wolves to shew themselves at the foot of the mountains, being 
made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with 
snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such 
creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two- 
legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger from, 
especially on the French side of the mountains. 

He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way 
that we were to go : so we readily agreed to follow him ; as did 
also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some French, 
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were 
obliged to come back again. 

Accordingly we all set out from Pampeluna, with our guide, 
on the fifteenth of November ; and indeed I was surprised, when, 
instead of going forward, he came directly back with us on the 
same road that we came from Madrid, above twenty miles ; when 
having passed two rivers, and come into the plain country, we 
found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country was 

Eleasant, and no snow to be seen ; but on a sudden, turning to 
is left, he approached the mountains another way ; and though 
it is true the hills and the precipices looked dreadful, yet he 
led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed the 
height of the mountains without being much encumbered with 
the snow ; and all on a sudden he shewed us the pleasant fruit- 
Ju] provinces of Languedoc and Gascoigne, all green and Hour- 



CH. VII. OF ROBINSON CRUSOS. 181 

ishing ; though iudeed they were at a great distance, and we 
had some rough way to pass yet. 

We were a little disturbed, however, when we found it snowed, 
one whole day and a night, so fast that we could not travel ; but 
he bid us be easy, and we should soon be past it all. We found, 
indeed, that we began to descend every day, and to come 
more north than before ; and so, depending upon our guide, we 
went on. 

It was about two hours before nighty when our guide being 
a little before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three mon- 
strous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way 
adjoining to a thick wood : two of the wolves flew upon the 
guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he had been de- 
voured, indeed, before we could have helped him : one of them 
fiEistened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with 
that violence that he had not time, or not presence of mind 
enough^ to draw his pistol, but hallooed and cried olit to us most 
lustily. My man Friday being next to me, I bade him ride up 
and see what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight 
of the man, he hallooed as loud as the other, *' O master ! O 
master !" But, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor 
man, and, with his pistol, shot the wolf that attadced him through 
the head. 

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ; 
for he, having been used to that kind of creature in his country, 
had no fear upon him, but went close up to the wolf, and shot 
him as above ; whereas any of us would have fired at a farther 
distance, and have perhaps either missed the wol^ or endangered 
shooting the man. 

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I ; and 
indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of 
Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the dismallest howling of 
wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains, 
that it was to us as if there had been a prodi^ous multitude of 
them ; and perhaps, indeed, there was not sudi a few as that we 
had no cause of apprehension. 

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other, that had 
fastened upon the horse, left him immediately, and fled, having 
happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle 
had stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt : 
the man, indeed, was most hurt ; for the racing creature had bit 
him twice, once on the arm, and the other time a little above his 
knee ; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the disorder 
of the horse, when Friday came up and shot the wolf. 

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday^s pistol we 
all mended our pace, and rode up as fast as the way (which was 
very difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the matter ; 
as soon as we came clear of the trees which blinded us before, 



182 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

"we saw plainly what had been the case, and how Friday had 
disengaged the poor guide, though we did not presently discern 
what kind of creature it was he had killed. 

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a 
surprising manner, as that which followed between Friday and 
the bear, Avhich gave us all (though at first we were surprised 
and afraid for him) the greatest diversion imaginable. As the 
bear is a heavy clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the 
wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two particular qua- 
lities, which generally are the rule of his actions : first as to 
men, who are not his proper prey (though I cannot say what 
excessive hunger might do, which was now the case, the ground 
being all covered with snow), he does not usually attempt 
them, unless they first attack him ; on the contrary, if you meet 
him in the woods, and do not meddle with him, he will not 
meddle with you ; yet then you must take care to be very civil 
to him, and give him the road ; for he is a very nice gentleman ; 
he will not go a step out of the way for a prince ; nay, if you are 
really afraid, your best way is to look another way, and keep 
going on ; for sometimes, if you stop, and stand still, and look 
fitedfastly at him, he takes it for an affront ; and if you throw 
or toss any thing at him, and it hits him, though it were but a 
bit of stick as big as your finger, he takes it for an affront, and 
sets all other business aside to pursue his revenge ; for he will 
have satisfaction in point of honour : and this is his first quality. 
The next is, that if he be once affronted, he will never leave you, 
night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round 
rate till he overtakes you. 

My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came 
up to him, he was helping him off his horse ; for the man was 
both hurt and frightened, and, 'indeed, the last more than the 
first; when, on a sudden, we spied the bear come out ot* the 
wood, and a monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that ever I 
saw. We were all a little surprised when we saw him ; but when 
Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the fellow's* 
countenance : ** O ! O ! O ! " says Friday three times, pointinj:^ 
to him, " master ! you give me te leave, me shakee te hand 
with him ; me make you good laugh." 

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased : " You fool," said 
I, ''he will eat you up." ** Eatee me up! eatee me up!" says 
Friday twice over again ; " me eatee him up ; me make you 
good laugh; you all stay here, me shew you good laugh." So 
down he sat, got his boots off in a moment, and putting on a 
pair of shoes which he hud in his pocket, gave ray other ser- 
vant his horse, and, with his gun, away he flew, as swiit as 
the wind. 

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with 
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, called to him, a if the 



CH. Vir. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 183 

bear could understand him : *^ Hark ye, hark ye, me speakee wit 
you." We followed at a distance ; for now being come down on 
the Gascoigne side of the mountains, we had entered a vast forest, 
where the country was plain and pretty open, though with many 
trees in it scattered here and there. 

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up 
with him quickly, and took up a great stone and threw at him, 
and it hit him just on the head ; but did him no more harm than 
if he had thrown it against a wall : it answered Friday's end, 
however ; for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did it purely 
to make the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh, as he 
called it. 

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he turned 
about, and came after him, taking tremendously long strides, 
and shuffling along at a strange rate, so as would put a horse to 
a middling gallop. Away ran Friday, and took his course as if 
he ran towards us for help ; so we all resolved to fire at once 
upon the bear, and deliver my man ; though I was angry at him 
heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going 
about his own business another way ; and especially I was ancjry 
that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run away ; and I 
called out, "You dog! is this your making us laugh? Come 
away, and take youi; horse, that we may shoot the creature." 
He heard me, and cried out, " No shoot, no shoot ; stand still, 
you get much laugh ;" and as the nimble creature ran two feet 
for the beast's one, he turned on a sudden, on one side of us, 
and seeing a great oak-tree fit for his purpose, he beckoned to 
us to follow, and doubling his pace, he got nimbly up the trep, 
laying his gun down upon the ground, at about five or six yards 
off. 

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance. 
The first thing he did was to stop at the gun, and smell to it, but 
he let it lie, and up he scrambled into the tree, climbing like a 
cat, though so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as 
I thought it, of my man ; and could not for my life see any thing 
to laugh at yet, till, seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode 
nearer to him. 

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the 
small end of a large branch, and the bear got aooiit halfway to 
him ; as soon as the bear got out to that part where the limb of 
the tree was weaker, " Ha," says he to us, " now you see me 
teechee the bear dance." So he falls a jumping, and shaking the 
bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and 
be^an to look behind him, to see how he should get back. Then, 
indeed, we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with 
him by a great deal : when he f^aw him stand still, he called out 
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English, 
" What, you come no further ? Pray you come further." So he 



184 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

left jumping and shaking the tree; and the bear, just as if he 
understood what he said, did come a little further ; then he fell 
a jumping again, and the bear stopped again. 

We thought that now was a good time to knock him on the 
head, and I called to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the 
bear ; but he cried out earnestly, " Oh, pray ! oh, pray ! no shoot, 
me shoot by and then y' (he would have said ** by and by.") 
However, to shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the 
bear stood so ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but 
still could not imagine what the fellow would do: for, first, we 
thought he depended upon shaking the bear off ; but we found 
the bear was too cunning for that too ; for he would not go out 
fiir enough to be thrown down, but clung fast with his great 
broad claws and feet ; so that we could not imagine what would 
be the end of it, and where the jest would be at last. 

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for seeing the bear 
cling fast to the bougrh, and that he could not be persuaded to 
come any further, '* Well, well," says he, " you no come further, 
me go, me go ; you no come to me, me go come to you." And 
upon this he went out to the smallest end of the bough, where it 
would bend with his weisrht, and gently let himself down by it, 
sliding dowm the bough till he came near enough to jump down 
on his feet ; and away he ran to his gun, took it up, and stood 
still. 

"Well," said I to him, " Friday, what will you do now ? Why 
don't you shoot him V " No shoot," says Friday, " no yet ; me 
shoot now, me no kill ; me stay, give you one more laugh ;" and 
indeed so he did, as you will see presently ; for when the bear 
saw his enemy gone, he came back from the bough where he 
stood, but did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every 
step, and coming backward till he got into the body of the tree ; 
then with the same hinder end foremost, he came down the 
tree, grasping it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time 
very leisurely. Just at this jimcture, and before he could set his 
hind feet upon the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped 
the muzzle of his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a 
stone. 

Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh ; and 
when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a laughing 
himself very loud. '* So we kill bear in my country," says he. 
" So vou kill them," said I ; " why you have no guns." " No," 
says tie, " no gun, but shoot great much long arrow." 

This was, indeed, a good diversion to us ; but we were still in 
a wild place, and our guide very much hurt ; and what to do we 
hardly knew ; the howling of wolves ran much in my head ; 
and, indeed, except the noise I once heard on the snores of 
Africa, I never heard any thing that filled me with so much 
horror. 



CH. VII. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 183 

These things, and the approach of night, called us off: or else, 
as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the 
skin of this monstrous creature off, which was worth saving ; but 
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us ; so we 
left him, and went forward on our journey. 

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep 
and dangerous as on the mountains ; and the ravenous creatures, 
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain 
country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a 
great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the 
country folk, killed a great many of their sheep and horses, and 
some people too. 

We had one dangerous place to pass, in which (our guide told 
us), if there were any more wolves m the country, we should find 
them ; and this was in a small plain, surrounded with woods on 
every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we were to 
pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to the 
village where we were to lodge. 

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first 
wood ; and a little after sunset when we came into the plain. 
We met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little 
plain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over, 
we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one after an- 
other, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in 
view ; they took no notice of us, and were gone and out of our 
sight in a few moments. 

Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched faint- 
hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed 
there were more wolves a coming. 

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us ; but we saw 
no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was near 
half a league, and entered the plam ; as soon as we came into 
the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The first 
object we met with was a poor horse which the wolves had killed, 
and at least a dozen of them at work ; we could not say eating 
him, but picking his bones rather; for they had eaten up all 
the flesh before. 

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither 
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at 
them, but I would not suffer him by any means ; for I found we 
were likely to have more business upon our hands than we were 
aware of. We had not gone half over the plain, when we began 
to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left, in a frightful 
manner ; and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on 
directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a Tine, 
as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced officers. I 
scarcely knew in what manner to receive tnem ; but found that 
to draw ourselves in a close line was the only way ; so we formed 

r2

in a moment ; but, that we, might not have too much interval, 
I ordered, that only every other man should fire ; and that the 
others, who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a 
second volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon 
us ; and that then those who had fired at first should not attempt 
to load their fusees again, but stand ready, with every one a pis- 
tol, — for we were all armed with a fusee and a pair of pistols each 
man ; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half 
of us at a time : however, at present, we had no necessity ; for, 
upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being 
terrified, as well with the noise as with the fire ; four of them 
being shot into the head, dropped ; several others were wounded, 
and went bleeding off, as we could see by the snow : whereupon 
remembering that I had been told, that the fiercest creatures 
were terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all our company 
to halloo as loud as we could ; and I found the notion not alto- 
gether mistaken ; for upon our shout, they began to retire, and 
turn about ; then I ordered a second volley to be fired in their 
rear, which put them to the gallop, and away they went to the 
woods. 

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that we 
might lose no time, we kept going ; but we had but little more 
than loaded our fusees, and put ourselves into a readiness, when 
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left ; only 
that it was farther onward the same way we were to go. 

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky, 
which made it the worse on our side ; but the noise increasing, 
we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of 
those savage creatures ; and, on a sudden, we perceived two or 
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind us, and one on our 
front, so that we seemed to be surrounded with them ; however, 
as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as fast as 
we could make our horses go, which, the way being very roug;h, 
was only a good large trot ; and in this manner we came in view 
of the entrance of a wood through which we were to pass, at the 
farther side of the plain ; but we were greatly surprised, when, 
coming near the lane, or pass, we saw a confused number of 
wolves standing just at the entrance. 

On a sudden, at another opening of the wood, we heard the 
noise of a gun; and, looking that way, out rushed a horse, with 
a saddle and bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or 
seventeen wolves after him full speed ; indeed the horse had the 
heels of them ; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at 
that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at 
last ; and no question but they did. 

But here we had a most horrible sight ; for, riding up to the 
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcasses of an- 
other horse, and of two men devoured by the ravenous creatures, 



CH. VII. OF ROBINSON CBUSOS. 187 

and one of the men was no doubt the same who fired the gun we 
had heard, for there lay an unloaded gun close by him ; but as to 
the man, his head, and the upper part of his body, was eaten up. 

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to 
take ; but the creatures soon determined us, for they gathered 
about us speedily, in hopes of prey ; and I verily believe there 
were three hundred of them. It happened very much to our 
advantage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little way 
from it, there lay some large timber-trees, which had been cut 
down the summer before, and I suppose lay there for carriage. I 
drew my little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves 
in a line behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and 
keeping that tree before us for a breast-work, to stand in a tri- 
angle, or three fronts, enclosing our horses in the centre. 

We did so, and it was well we did ; for never was a more 
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in this place. 
They came on us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted 
the piece of timber (which, as I said, was our breast-work), as 
if they were only rushing upon their prey ; and this fury of theirs, 
it seems, \a as principally occasioned by their seeing our horses 
behind us, which was the prey they aimed at. I ordered our men 
to fire, as before, every other man ; and they took their aim so 
sure, that indeed they killed several of the wolves at the first 
volley ; but there was a necessity to keep up a continual firing, 
for they came on like demons, those behind pushing on those 
before. 

When we had fired our second volley, we thought they stopped 
a little, and I hoped they would have gone ofi^, but it was but a 
moment, for others came forward again ; so we fired two volleys 
of our pistols ; and I believe in these four firings we had killed 
seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as many ; yet 
they came an again. 

I was loath to spend our last shot too hastily ; so I called my 
servant, not my man Friday, who was better employed, — for, 
with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusee 
and his own while we were engaged, — but, as I said, I called my 
other man ; and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a 
train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train. He 
did 80, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came 
up to it, and some were got up upon it ; when I, snapping an 
uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire ; those that 
were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of 
them fell, or rather jumped in amongst us, with the force and 
fright of the fire ; we despatched these in an instant, and the 
rest were so frightened with the light, which the night (for now 
it was very near dark) made more terrible, that they drew back 
a little. 



190 LIFE AND ADVENTURES 

first part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of Providence's 
chequer- work, and of a variety which the world will seldom be 
able to shew the like of: beginning foolishly, but closing much 
more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as 
to hope tor. 

Any one would think that, in this state of complicated good 
fortune, I wag past running any more hazards ; and so indeed 
I had been, if other circumstances had concurred ; but I was 
inured to a wandering life, had no family, not many relations, 
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance ; and 
though I had sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep 
the country out of my head, and had a great mind to be on the 
wing again ; especially I could not resist the strong inclination 
I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniards 
were in being there ; and hov^ the rogues I left there had used 
them. 

My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me from it, and 
so far prevailed with me, that almost for seven years she pre- 
vented my running abroad ; during which time 1 took my two 
nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into my care : the 
eldest having something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman, 
and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate, after 
my decease : the other I put out to a captain of a ship ; and after 
five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fel- 
low, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea : and this 
young fellow afterwards drew me in, old as I was, to farther 
adventures myself. In the mean time, I in part settled myself 
here : for, first of all, I married, and that not either to my disad- 
vantage or dissatisfaction, and had three children, two sons and 
one daughter ; but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home 
with good success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go 
abroad, and his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in 
his ship as a private trader to the East Indies. This was in the 
year 1694. 

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my 
successors the Spaniards, had the whole story of their lives, and 
of the fellows I left there. 

Here I stayed about twenty days ; left them supplies of all 
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes, 
tools, and two workmen, which I brought from England with 
me ; namely, a carpenter and a smith. 

Besides this, I shared the island into parts with them, reserved 
to myself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts, 
re8j)ectively, as they agreed on ; and having settled all things 
with them, and engaged them not to leave the place, I left them 
there. 

I next touched at the Brazils, from whence I sent a barque, 
which I bought there, with more people to the island ; and in it. 



CH. VII. 



OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 



191 



besides other supplies, I sent seven women, bein^ such as 1 found 
proper for service, or for wives to such as would take them. I 
sent them also from the Brazils five cows^ some sheep, and some 
hogs. 

But all these things, with some very surprising incidents in 
some new adventures of my own, for ten years more^ I may, 
perhaps^ give a farther account of hereafter.

196 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it increase daily 
upon my hands. 

Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at least not 
enough to resist the strong inclination I had to ^o abroad again ; 
particularly the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, 
and the colony I left there, ran in my head continually. I 
dreamed of it all night, and my imagination dwelt upon it all day; 
it was uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so 
steadily and strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep : in 
short, nothing could remove it out of my mind ; it even broke so 
violently into all my discourses, that it made my conversation 
tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else. 

But to return to my story. In this kind of temper T had lived 
some years ; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, 
no agreeable diversion, but what had something or other of this 
in it ; so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent upon 
it, told me very seriously one night, that she believed there was 
some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had 
determined me to go thither again ; and that she found nothing 
hindered my going but my being engaged to a wife and family. 
She told me, that it was true she could not think of parting with 
me ; but as she was assured, that if she was dead, it would be the 
first thing I would do ; so, as it seemed to her that the thing was 
determined above, she would not be the only obstruction ; for if 
I thought fit and resolved to go ; — here she found me very intent 
upon her words, and that I looked very earnestly at her; so that 
it a little disordered her, and she stopped. I asked her why she 
did not go on, and say out what she was going to say ? But I 
perceived her heart was too full, and some tears stood in her eyes. 
" Speak out, my dear," said I ; " are you willing I should go ?" 
" No," said she, very affectionately, ** I am far from willing ; 
but if you are resolved to go, rather than I should be the only hin- 
drance, I will go with you ; for though I think it a preposterous 
thing for one of your years and in your condition, yet if it must 
be, I won't leave you ; for if it be your duty to go, I will also 
make it mine to go with you ; or otherwise dispose of me, that I 
may not obstruct it." 

This affectionate behaviour in my wife brought me to consider 
what I was doing ; and I began to argue with myself seriously, 
what business I had (after threescore years, and after such a life 
of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and 
easy a manner) to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon 
adventures, fit only for youth and poverty to run into. 

I resolved, therefore, to divert myself with other things, and 
to engage in some business that mig^lit effectually tie me up from 
any more fancies of this kind ; fori found the thing return upon 
me chiefly when I was idle, or had nothing of moment immedi- 
ately before me. 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 197 

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the county of Bed- 
ford, and resolved to remove thither. I had a little convenient 
house upon it, and the land I found was capable of great improve- 
ment, and that it was many ways suited to my inc&nation, which 
delighted in cultivating, planting, and improving of land ; and 
particularly, being an inland country, I was removed from con- 
yersing among ships, sailors, and things relating to the remote 
parts of the world. 

But in the middle of all this retired and pleasant felicity, one 
blow from unforeseen Providence unhinged me at once ; and not 
only made a breach upon me, inevitable and incurable, but drove 
me, by its consequence, into a deep relapse into the wandering 
disposition, which, as I may say, being born in my very blood, 
soon recovered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent 
distemper, came on with an irresistible force upon me ; so that 
nothing could make any more impression upon me. This blow 
was the loss of my wife. 

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon her, to giye 
a character of her particular virtues, and make my court to the 
sex by the flattery of a iuneral sermon. She was, in a few words, 
the stay of all my affairs, the centre of all my enterprises ; and 
did more to guide my rambling gemus, than a mother's tears, a 
father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning 
powers could do. I was happy in listening to her advice, and in 
being moved by her entreaties, and to the last degree dislocated 
and desolate in the world by the loss of her. 

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly around me. 
I was as much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the 
Brazils when I went nrst on shore there; and as much alone 
(except as to the assistance of servants) as t was in my island. I 
knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw the world 
busy round me ; one part labouring for bread, and the other part 
squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures, equally miser- 
able, because the end tttey proposed still fled from them ; for the 
man of pleasure eyery day surfeited of his vice, and heaped up 
work for sorrow and repentance; and the men of labour spent 
their strength in daily strugglings for bread to maintain the vital 
strength they laboured with ; so living in a daily circulation, of 
sorrow, living but to work, and working but to live, as if daily 
bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a wearisome life 
the only occasion of daily bread. 

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the 
island ; where I suffered no more com to grow than I wanted, 
and bred no more goats than I had occasion for; where the 
money lay in the drawer till it grew rusty, and had scarce the 
favour to be looked upon in twenty years. 

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have 
done^ and as reason and religion had dictated to me^ would have 

s2 



198 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full 
felicity, and that there was something which certainly was the 
reason and end of life, superior to all these things, and which 
was either to be possessed, or at least hoped for, on this side the 
grave. 

But my sage counsellor was gone : I was like a ship without 
a pilot, that could only run before the wind ; my thoughts ran 
all away again into the old affair; my head was quite turned with 
the whimsies of foreign adventures; and all the pleasant inno- 
cent amusements of my farm and my garden, my cattle, and my 
family, which before entirely possessed me, were nothing to me, 
had no relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or food 
to one that has no taste. In a word, I resolved to leave off 
house-keeping, let my farm, and return to London ; and in a few 
months after I did so. 

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, 
who, as I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea, 
and had made him commander of a ship, was come home from 
a short voyage to Bilboa, being the first he had made. He came 
to me, and told me, that some merchants of his acquaintance had 
been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the East 
Indies and to China, as priviSe traders ; " And now, uncle,'' says 
he, "if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you 
upon your old habitation in the island ; for we are to touch at the 
Brazils." 

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wander- 
ing was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had 
in his thoughts to say, when that very morning before he came 
to me, I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolv- 
ing every part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this 
resolution, namely, that I would go to Lisbon, and consult with 
my old sea-captain ; and so, if it was rational and practicable, I 
would go and see the island again, and see what was become 
of my people there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts 
of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence, 
getting a patent for the possession, and I know not what ; when 
m the middle of all this, in came my nephew, as I have said, 
with his project of carrying me thither, on his way to the East 
Indies. 

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that 
is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have 
said so much, that I told him, in few words, if he agreed with 
the merchants, I would ^o with him ; but I told him, I would 
not promise to go any farther than my own island. " Why, 
sir,*' said he, "you don't want to be left there again, I hope?" 
" Why," said I, " can you not take me up again on your 
return?" He told me it could not be possible that the mer- 
chants would allow him to come that way with a laden ship 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 199 

of such value, it being a month's sail out of his way, and mi^ht 
be three or four. "Besides, sir, if I should miscarry,'' said he, 
"and not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the 
condition you were in before." 

This was very rational ; but we both found out a remedy for 
it, which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, 
being taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship, might, by 
the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us, 
be set up again in the island, and finished, fit to go to sea, in a 
few days. 

I was not long resolving ; for, indeed, the importunities of my 
nephew joined in so effectually with my inclination, that nothing 
could oppose me ; on the other hand, my wife being dead, there 
was no one so much concerned for me, as to persuade me 
one way or other, except my ancient good friend the widow, 
who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years, my easy 
circumstances, and the needless hazard of a long voyage; and, 
above all, my young children : but it was all to no purpose. I 
had an irresistible desire to the voyage ; and I told her I thought 
there was something so uncommon in the impressions I had upon 
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting 
Providence, if I should attempt to stay at home : after which 
she ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not only in 
making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my family 
affairs in my absence, and providing for the education of my 
children. 

In order to this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had 
in such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that 
I was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done 
them, whatever might befall me ; and for their education, I left 
it wholly to my widow, with a suflicient maintenance to herself 
for her care ; all of which she richly deserved, for no mother 
could have taken more care in their education, or understood it 
better ; and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank 
her for it. 

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January, 
1694-5, and I with my man Friday went on board m the Downs 
the 8th, having besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a 
very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my 
colony, which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to 
leave so. 

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I purposed to 
place there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon 
my own account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there, 
or carry them forward, as they should appear willing ; particu- 
larly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy ingeni- 
ous fellow who was a cooper by trade, but was aleo a general 
mechanic ; for he was dexterous at making wheels^ and hand- 



200 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

mills to grind corn, was a good turner, and a ^ood pot-maker ; 
he also made any thing that was proper to make of earth or of 
wood ; in a word, we called him our Jack of all trades. 

With these I carried a tailor, who had ofi'ered himself to go 
passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, hut afterwards 
consented to stay on our new plantation, and proved a most handy 
fellow as could oe desired in many other businesses besides that of 
this trade ; for^ as I observed formerly, necessity arms us for all 
employments. 

Mv cargo, as near as I can collect, consisted of a sufficient 
quantity of linen and some thin . English stuffs for clothing the 
Spaniards that I expected to find there, and enough of them, as 
by my calculation^ might comfortably supply them for seven 
years. The materials which I carried for clothing them, with 
gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as tlicy could 
want for wearing, amounted in value to above 200 pounds, in- 
cluding some beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly 
kitchen utensils, with pots, Kettles, pewter, brass, &:c.; and near 
a hundred pounds more in iron-work, nails, tools of every 
kind, staples, hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could 
think of. 

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees, be- 
sides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, and 
two pieces of brass cannon ; and because I knew not what time 
and what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred 
barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of 
some pikes and halberts. So that, in short, we had a large maga- 
zine of all sorts of stores ; and 1 made my nephew carry two small 
quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave 
behind if there was occasion ; that when they came there we 
might build a fort, aiid man it against all sorts of enemies ; and, 
indeed, I at first thought there would be need enough of it all, 
and much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the 
island. 

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to 
meet with, and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt 
the reader, who, perhaps, may be impatient to hear how matters 
went with my colony ; yet some odd accidents, cross winds, and 
bad weather happened on this first setting out, which made the 
voyage longer than I expected it at first ; and I, who had never 
made but one voyage, namely, my first voyage to Guinea, in 
which I might be said to come back again, as the voyage was at 
first designed, began to think that I was bom to be never con- 
tented with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate 
at sea. 

Contrary winds first obliged us to put in at Galway in Ire- 
land, where we lay wind-bound two-and-twenty days ; but we had 
this satisfBiction with the disaster, that provisions were there ex<- 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 201 

ceediD^ cheap and in the atmost plenty ; so that while we lay 
here we never toached the ship's stores, but rather added to them. 
Here also I took in several live hogs, and two cows and calves, 
which I resolved, it' I had a good passage, to put on shore in my 
island ; but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them. 

We set out the 5th of February j&om Ireland, and had a very 
fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be 
about the 20th of February, late in the evening, when the mate, 
having the watch, came into the round-house, and told us he saw 
a flash of fire, and heard a gun fired ; and while he was telling us 
of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard another. 
This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where for a 
whQe we heard nothing ; but in a few minutes we saw a very 
great light, and found that there was some very terrible fire at a 
distance. Immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in 
which we all agreed that there could be no land that way in which 
the fire shew^ itself, nor for 500 leagues, for it appeared at 
w.N.w. Upon this we concluded it must be some ship on Hre at 
sea ; and as by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we con- 
cluded it could not be far off, we stood directly towards it, and 
were presently satisfied we should discover it, because the fiairther 
we sailed the greater the light appeared, though the weather 
being hazy, we could not perceive any thing but the light for a 
while. In about half an hour's sailing, the wind being £ur for us, 
though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, we 
could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle 
of the sea. 

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at 
all acquainted with the persons engaged in it. I presentlj recol- 
lected my former circumstances, in what condition I was m when 
taken up by the Portugal captain ; and how much more deplo- 
rable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this 
ship must be, if they had no other ship in company with them. 
Upon this I immediately ordered that ^yre guns should be fired, 
one soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice to 
them that there was help for them at hand, and that they might 
endeavour to save themselves in their boat ; for though we could 
see the flame of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see 
nothing of us. 

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning 
ship drove, waiting for daylight, when on a sudden, to our great 
terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the 
air, and in a few minutes all the fire was out, and the rest of the 
ship sunk. This was a terrible and indeed an afiiicting sight for 
the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, must be either all 
destroyed in the ship, or be in the atmost distress in their boat in 
the middle of the ocean, which at present, by reason it was dark, 
I could not see. However, to direct them as well as I was able, I 



202 LIPB AND ADVENTURES FT. It. 

caused lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship where we 
could, and which we had lanterns for ; and kept firing guns all 
the night long, letting them know by this that there was a ship 
not far off. 

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's 
boats by the help of our perspective glasses, and found there were 
two of them, both thronged with people and deep in the water ; 
we perceived they rowed, the wind being against them ; that they 
saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them. 

We immediately spread our ancient to let them know we saw 
them, and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come on board ; 
and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In a little 
more than half an hour we came up with them, and took them 
all in, being no less than sixty-four men, women, and children, 
£oT there were a great many passengers. 

We found it was a French merchant-ship of 300 tons, home- 
ward-bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. The master 
gave us a long account of the distress of his ship, how the fire 
began in the steerage by the negligence of the steersman, but, on 
his crying out for help, was, as every body thought, entirely put 
out, when they found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten 
into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that they could 
not effectually quench it, till getting in between the timbers and 
within the ceiling of the vessel, it proceeded into the hold, and 
mastered all the skill and all the application they were able to 
exert. 

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, 
which, to their great comfort, were pretty large, being their long 
boat and a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no 
great service to them, other than to get some fresh water and 
provisions into her after they had secured their lives from the fire. 
They had, indeed, small hope of their lives by getting into these 
boats at that distance from any land, only, as they said well, that 
they were escaped from the fire, and had a possibility that some 
ship mi^ht happen to be at sea, and might take them in. They 
had sails, oars, and a compass, and were preparing to make the 
best of their way back to Newfoundland, the wind blowing pretty 
fair, for it blew an easy gale at s.e. by b. They had as much 
provisions and water as, with sparing it so as to be next door to 
starving, might support them about twelve days ; in which, if 
they had no bad weather and no contrary winds, the captain said 
he hoped he might reach the banks of Newfoundland, and might, 
perhaps, take some fish to sustain them till they might go on 
shore. But there were so many chances against them in all 
these cases, such as storms to overset and founder them, rains 
and cold to benumb and perish their limbs, contrary winds to 
keep them out and starve them, that it must have been next to 
miraculous if they had escaped. 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 203 

They were, however, agreeably surprised with seeing our 
lights and hearing our guns. This set them to work with their 
oars to keep their boats ahead, at least that we might the sooner 
come up with them -, and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they 
found we saw them. 

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the 
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor de- 
livered people run into, to express the joy of their souls at so 
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described ; 
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and 
hands, make up the sum of its variety ; but an excess of joy, a 
surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it. There were 
some in tears, some tearing themselves, as if they had been in 
the greatest agonies of sorrow ; some stark raving and downright 
lunatic ; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others 
wringing their hands ; some were dancing, some singing, some 
laughing, more crying ; many quite dumb, not able to speak a 
word; others swooning and ready to faint; and a few were 
crossing themselves, and giving God thanks. 

There were two priests among them, one an old man and the 
other a young man ; and that which was strangest was, that the 
oldest man was the worst. 

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself 
safe, he dropped down stone-dead, to all appearance; not the 
least sign of hie could be perceived in him. Our surgeon imme- 
diately applied proper remedies to recover him, and was the only 
man in the ship that believed he was not dead. At length he 
opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part 
so as to warm it as much as possible. Upon this the blood, wnich 
only dropped at first, flowed something freely ; in three minutes 
after the man opened his eyes, and about a quarter of an hour 
after that he spoke, grew better, and quite well. After the blood 
was stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly well, took 
a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him, and was what we 
call come to himself. About a quarter of an hour after, they 
came running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a 
French woman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone 
stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his 
circumstances, and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy, his 
spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them, 
the blood grew hot and feverish, and the man was as fit for 
Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it. The surgeon would 
not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him something to 
doze and put him to sleep, which, after some time, operated 
upon him, and he waked the next morning perfectly composed 
and well. 

The younger priest behaved with great self-command, and was 
really an example of a serious well-goyemed mind. At his first 



204 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on his face, pro- 
strating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I 
unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had 
been in a swoon ; but he spoke calmly, thanked me^ told me he 
was giving God thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave 
him a few moments^ and that, next to his Maker, he would give 
me thanks also. 

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left 
him, but kept others from interrupting him also. He contmued 
in that posture about three minutes, or a little more, after I left 
him ; then came to me, as he had said he would, and, with a 
great deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, 
thanked me that had, under God, given him and so many mise- 
rable creatures their lives. 

After this the young priest applied himself to his country- 
folks ; laboured to compose them ; persuaded, entreated, argued, 
reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the 
exercise of their reason ; and with some he had success, though 
others were, for a time, out of all government of themselves. 

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may- 
be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding 
themselves in all the extravagances of their passions ; for if an 
excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the 
reach of their reason, what will not the extravagances of anger, 
rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to ? And, indeed, here I 
saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions 
of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of 
sorrow and anger. 

We were rather disordered by these extravagances among 
our new guests for the first day ; but when they had retired to 
the lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would allow, 
and had slept heartily (as most of them did), they were quite 
another sort of people. 

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the 
kindness shewn them, was wanting : the French, it is known, are 
naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain, and one 
of the priests, came to me the next day ; and desiring to speak with 
me and my nephew, the commander, began to consult with us 
what should be done with them ; and first they told us, that, as 
we had saved their lives, so all they had was little enough for a 
return to us tor that kindness received. The captain 'said, they 
had saved some money and some things of value in their boats, 
catched hastily up out of the flames ; and if we would accept 
it, they were ordered to make an offer of it all to us ; they only 
desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if pos- 
sible, they might get passage to France. 

My nephew was for accepting their money at first word, and 
to consider what to do with them afterwards ; but I over-ruled 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 205 

him in that part ; for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a 
strange country. 

I therefore told the French captain, that it was true that we 
had taken them up in their distress ; but that it was our duty to 
do so, as we were fellow-creatures, and as we would desire to be 
so delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity ; that 
we had done nothing for them, but what we believed they would 
have done for us if we had been in their case, and they m ours ; 
but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them ; 
and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from 
them which they had saved out of the hre, and then set them on 
shore and leave them ; that this would be, first to save them from 
death, and then kill them ourselves ; save them from drowning, 
and then abandon them to starving ; and therefore I would not 
let the least thing be taken from them. As to setting them on 
shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding difficulty to 
us, for that the ship was bound to the East Indies ; and though 
we were driven out of our course to the westward a very great 
way, and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose for theilr 
deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our 
voyage on this particular account ; nor could my nephew, the 
captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under 
charter-party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brazils ; and 
all I knew he could do for them was, to put ourselves in the 
way of meeting with other ships homeward-bound from the West 
Indies, and get them passage, if possible, to England or France. 

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, that 
they could not but be very thankful for it : but they were in very 
great consternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of 
being carried away to the East Indies ; and they then entreated 
me, that, seeing I was driven so far to the westward before I 
met with them, I would at least keep on the same course to the 
banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet 
with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back 
to Canada, from whence they came. 

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part ; 
and, therefore, I inclined to agree to it ; tor, indeed, I consi- 
dered, that to carry this whole company to the East Indies, 
would not only be an intolerable severity upon the poor people, 
but would be ruining our whole voyage, by devouring all our 
provisions. So I thought it no breach of charter-party, but what 
an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us ; and in 
which no one could say we were to blame ; for the laws of God 
and nature would have forbid .that we should refuse to take up 
two boats full of people in such a distressed condition ; and the 
nature of the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor 
people, obliged us to set them on shore somewhere or other for 
their deliverance. So I consented that we would carry them to 

T 



206 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit ; and if not, 
to Martinico, in the West Indies. 

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty- 
good ; and as the winds had remained in the points between n.e. 
and s.E. a long time, we missed several opportunities of send- 
ing them to France. We met, indeed, several ships bound to 
Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher's ; but 
they had been so long beating up against the wind, that they 
durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting provisions for 
the voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take 
in ; so we were obliged to go on. It was about a week after 
this that we made the banks of Newfoundland, where (to shorten 
my story) we put all our French people on board a bark, which 
they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards 
to carry them to France, if they could get provision to victual 
themselves with. The young priest, however, hearing we were 
bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and 
to be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel, which I readily 
agreed to ; for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good 
reason, as will appear afterwards ; also four of the seamen en- 
tered themselves m our ship, and proved very useful fellows. 

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, 
steering away s.: and s. by B.ifor about twenty days together, 
sometimes with little or no wind at. all) when we met with another 
subject for our hunifanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as 
that before. 

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees five minutes n. 
and the 19th day of March, 1604-5, when we spied a sail; our 
course beine s.e. and by s. We soon perceived it was a large 
vessel, and that she bore up to us ; but could not at first know 
what to make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found 
she had lost her main- top- mast, fore-misist, and bowsprit ; and 
presently she fired a gun as a signal of distress ; the weather was 
pretty good, wind at n.n.w. a fresh gale, and we soon came to 
speak with her. 

We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, 
but had been blown out of the road a few days before she was 
ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief 
mate were both gone on shore ; so that, besides the terror of the 
storm, they were but in an indifferent case for good artists to 
bring the ship home. They had been already nine weeks at 
sea, and had met with another terrible storm after the hurricane 
was over, which had blown them quite out of their knowledge, 
to the westward, and in which they lost their masts as above ; 
they told us, they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, 
but were then driven away again to the south-east by a strong 
gale of wind at n.n.w. the same that blew now, and having no 
sails to work the ship with, but a main course, and a kind of 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CBtJSOE. 207 

square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up, they 
could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand 
away for the Canaries. 

But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost 
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had un- 
dergone. Their bread and flesh were auite gone, they had not 
an ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days ; 
the only relief they had was, their water was not all spent, 
and they had about hidf a barrel of flour left ; they had sugar 
enough ; some sucoades, or sweetmeats, they had at first, but 
they were devoured ; and they had seven casks of rum. 

There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant, on 
board, who were goine passengers, and, thinking the ship was 
ready to sail, unhappUy came on board the evening before the 
hurricane began ; and, having no provisions of their own left, 
they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest ; for the 
seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves, 
had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers; 
and they were indeed in a condition that their misery is very 
hard to describe. 

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not 
led me, tne weather being fair, and the wind abated, to go on 
board the ship. The second mate, who upon this occasion com- 
manded the ship, had been on board our ship ; he told me, 
indeed, they had three passengers in the great cabin, and that 
they were in a deplorable condition : " Nay," says he, " I be- 
lieve they are dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above 
two days ; and I was afraid to inquire after them, for I had 
nothing to relieve them with." 

We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief 
we could spare ; and, indeed, I had so far over-ruled things ^ith 
my nephew, that I would have victualled them, though we had 
gone away to Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to 
have supplied ourselves : but there was no necessity for that. 

But now they were in a new peril ; for there was danger of 
their eating too much even of that little we gave them. The 
mate, or commander, brought six men with him in his boat ; 
but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, 
they could hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was very 
ill, and half-starved ; for he declared he had reserved nothing 
from the men, and went share and share alike with them in 
every bit they eat. 

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him 
immediately, and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he 
began to be sick ; so he stopt a while, and our surgeon mixed 
him up something with some broth, which he said would be to 
him both food and physic ; and after he had taken it, he grew 
better. In the mean time I forgot not the men ; I ordered vie- 



208 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

tuds to be ffiven them, which the poor creatures rather devoured 
than ate. They were so exceedingly hungry, that they were in 
a kind ravenous, and had no command of themselves ; and two 
of them ate with so much greediness, that they were in danger 
of their lives the next morning. 

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me, 
and brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of, at my 
£rst coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least 
mouthful of food, or anv prospect of procuring any ; besides 
the hourly apprehension I had of being made the food of other 
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus relating to me 
the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put 
out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor 
creatures in the great cabin ; viz. the mother, her son, and the 
maid-servant, whom he seemed to confess they had wholly neg- 
lected, their own extremities being so great ; by which I under- 
stood, that they had really given them no food at all ; and that, 
therefore, they must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, 
on the floor or deck of the cabin. 

As I, therefore, kept the mate on board, with his men, to 
refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that were 
left on board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, 
and, with mv mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of 
bread, and rour or five pieces of beef, to boil. Our surgeon 
charged the men, to cause the meat to be boiled while they 
stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men 
taking it to eat raw, or snatching it out of the pot before it was 
well boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at a 
time. By this caution he preserved the men, who would other- 
wise have killed themselves with that very food that was given 
them on purpose to save their lives. 

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great 
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in, and, 
if they were alive, to comfort them, and give them what refresh- 
ment was proper ; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher 
with some of the prepared brotn which he had given the mate 
that was on board, and which he did not question would restore 
them gradually. 

I was not satisfied with this ; but, as I said above, having a 
^reat mind to see the scene of misery which I knew the shin 
Itself would present me with, in a more lively manner than 1 
could have it by report, I took the master, or captain of the 
ship, as we now called him, with me, and went myself a little 
after in their boat. 

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the 
victuals out of the boiler before it was ready ; but my mate ob- 
served his order, and kept a good guard at the cook-room door ; 
and the man he placed there, after using all possible persuasions 



CH. I. OF BOBINSON CBUSOE. 209 

to have patience, kept them off by force. However, he caused 
some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened with the 
liquor of the meat, which they call brewis, and gave them every 
one one, to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their 
own safety, that he was obliged to ^ve them but a little at a 
time. But it was all in vain ; and had I not come on board, 
and their own commander and officers with me, and with good 
words, and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe 
they would have broken into the cook-room by force, and torn 
the meat out of the furnace ; however we pacified them, and fed 
them gradually and cautiously for the first time, and the next 
time gave them more, and so the men did well enough. 

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of 
another nature, and far beyond the rest. The mother, who, as 
the men reported, was a woman of good sense and good breed- 
ing, had spared all she could get so affectionately for her son, 
that at last she entirely sunk under it. And when the mate of 
our ship went in, she sat upon the floor or deck, with her back 
up against the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast, 
and her head sunk in between her shoulders, like a corpse, 
though not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive 
and encourage her, and with a spoon put some broth into her 
mouth ; she opened her lipi^, and lifted up one hand, but could 
not speak ; yet she understood what he said, and made signs to 
him, intimating that it was too late for her, but pointed to her 
child, as if she would have said, they should take care of him. 
She died the same night. 

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most affec- 
tionate mother's life, was not so far gone ; yet he lay in a cabin- 
bed as one stretched out, with hardly any life left in him. He 
had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the 
rest of it ; however, being young, and having more strength than 
his mother, the mate got something down his throat, and he 
began sensibly to revive. 

But the next care was the poor maid. She lay all along upon 
the deck hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen 
down in an apoplexy, and struggled for life; her limbs were 
distorted, one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair, 
and she griped it so hard that we could not easily make her let 
go ; her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both toge- 
ther, set fast against the frame of the cabin-table : in short, she 
lay just like one in the last agonies of death, and yet she was 
alive too. 

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and 
terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us 
afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw 
dying two or three days before, and whom she loved most ten- 
derly. 

T 2 



210 LIFB AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

We knew not what to do with this poor girl ; for when our 
surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge and experi- 
ence, had, with great application, recovered her as to life, he 
had her upon his hand as to her senses, for she was little less 
than distracted for a considerable time after. 

Our business was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not 
to lie by for them ; and though they were willing to steer the 
same course with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail to 
keep pace with a ship that had no masts ; however, as their cap- 
tain begged of us to help him to set up a main top-mast, and a 
kind of a top-mast to his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie 
by him for three or four days ; and then having given him five 
barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a 
proportion of peas, flour, and what other things we could spare; 
and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of 
eight of tnem for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board 
with us, at their own earnest request, the youth, and the maid, 
and all their goods. 

The young lad was about seventeen years of age ; a pretty, 
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth ; greatly dejected with the 
loss of his mother ; and, as it seems, had lost his father but a 
few months before at Barbadoes. He begged of the surgeon to 
speak to me, to take him out of the ship ; for he said, the cruel 
fellows had murdered his mother ; and indeed so they had, that 
is to say, passively ; for they might have spared a small sus- 
tenance to the poor helpless widow, that might have kept her 
alive. But hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no 
right. 

I was now in the latitude of 19° 32', and had hitherto had a 
tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the winds had 
been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little incidents 
of wind, weather, currents, &c. on the rest of our voyage; but, 
shortening my story for the sake of what is to follow, sTiall ob- 
serve, that I came to my old habitation, the island, on the 10th of 
April, 1695. It was with no small difiiculty that I found the 
place ; for as I came to it, and went from it before, on the south 
and east side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so now 
coming in between the main and the island, and having no chart 
for the coast, nor any landmark, I did not know it when I saw it, 
or know whether I saw it or not. 

We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several 
islands in the mouth of the great river Oroonoque, but none for 
my purpose. At last coasting from one island to another, some- 
times with the ship, sometimes with the Frenchmen's shallop 
(which we had found a convenient boat, and therefore kept her 
with their very good will), at length I came fair on the south 
side of my island, and I presently knew the very countenance of 
the place; so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside 



CH. I. OF BOBINSON C&USOB. 211 

with the little creek where was my old habitation. As soon as 
I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked him if he knew 
where he was? He looked about a little, and presently clapping 
his hands, cried, " O yes, O there, O yes, O there !" pointing to 
our old habitation, and fell a dancing and capering like a mad 
fellow; and I had much ado to keep him from jumping into the 
sea, to swim on shore to the place. 

" Well, Friday," says I, " do you think we shall find any 
body here, or not? and what do you think, shall we see your 
father?" The fellow stood mute as a stock a good while ; but 
when I named his father, the poor affectionate creature looked 
dejected ; and I could see the tears run down his face very 
plentifully. " What is the matter, Friday?" said I, "are you 
troubled because you may see your father ?" " No, no," says he, 
shaking his head, " no see him more, no ever more see again." 
" Why so," said I, " Friday ? how do you know that ?" ** O no, 

no," says Friday, "he long ago die; long ago, he much old 
man." ** Well, well," says I, " Friday, you don't know ; but 
shall we see any one else then ?" The fellow, it seems, had better 
ey^s than I, and he pointed just to the hill above my old house ; 
and though we lay half a league off, he cries out, ** We see! we 
see ! yes, we see much man there, and there, and there." I 
looked, but I could see nobody, no, not with a perspective glass ; 
which was, I suppose, because I could not hit the place ; for the 
fellow was right, as I found, upon inquiry the next day, that 
there were five or six men altogether looking at the ship, not 
knowing what to think of us. 

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I caused the 
English ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them 
notice we were friends ; and about half a quarter of an hour 
after, we perceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek ; so 

1 immediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me ; and, 
hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I went directly on 
shore, taking with me the young priest I mentioned, to whom I 
had told the whole story of my living there, and the manner of it, 
and every particular, both of myself, and those I left there ; and 
who was on that account extremely desirous to go with me. We 
had besides about sixteen men very well armed, if we had found 
any new guest there which we did not know of; but we had no 
need of weapons. 

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, 
we rowed directly into the creek ; and the first man I fixed my 
eye upon was the Spaniard, whose life I had saved, and whom I 
knew by his face perfectly well. I ordered nobody to go on shore 
at first but myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat, 
for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance, a 
good way off from the Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of 
him ; and if they had not let him go on shore, he would have 



212 LIFE AND ADVENTURES TT. II. 

jumped into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, than he flew 

away to his father like an arrow out of a bow. It would have 

made any man shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolution, to 

have seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy, when he 

.came to his father ; how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked 

his face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and 

lay down by him ; then stood and looked at him as any one 

would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour together ; 

then he would lie down upon the ground, and stroke his legs and 

kiss them, and then set up again, and stare at him ; one would 

have thought the fellow oewitched. But it would have made 

a dog laugh to see how the next dav his passion ran out another 

way. In the morning he walked along the shore, to and again, 

with his father, several hours, always leading him by the hand, 

as if he had been a lady ; and every now and then he would come 

to fetch something or other for him from the boat, either a lump 

of sugar or a dram, a biscuit-cake, or something or other that was 

good. In the afternoon his frolics ran another way ; for then he 

would set the old man down upon the ground, and dance about 

him, and make a thousand antic postures and gestures ; and all 

the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and telling 

him one story or another of his travels, and of what had happened 

to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial affection 

was to be found in Christians to their parents, in our parts of the 

world, one would be tempted to say, there would hardly have 

been any need of the fifth commandment. 

But this is a digression ; I return to my landing. It would 
be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that 
the Spaniards received me with. The first Spaniard, who (as I 
said) was he whose life I had saved, came towards the boat, at- 
tended by one more, carrying a flag of truce also; and he not only 
did not know me at first, but he had no thoughts, no notion, of 
its being I that was come, till I spoke to him. '^Signor," said I, 
in Portuguese, "do you not know me?" At which he spoke not a 
word ; but giving his musket to the man that was with him, he 
threw his arms abroad, and saying something in Spanish that I 
did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, telling me, 
he was inexcusable not to know that face again that he had once 
seen, as of an angel from heaven sent to save his life. And then 
beckoning to the person who attended him, he bade him go call 
out his comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old 
habitation, where he would give me possession of my own house 
again, and where I should see there had been but mean improve- 
ments. So I walked along with him; but, alas! I could no 
more find the place again than if I had never been there; for 
they had planted so many trees, and placed them in such a pos- 
ture, so thick and close to one another, that, in ten-years time 
they were grown so big that the place was inaccessible, except 



H0BIIT80H CRUaOE. 



CH. I. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 213 

by such windings, and blind ways, as they themselves only who 
made them could find. 

I asked them, what put them upon all these fortifications. 
He told me, I would say there was need enough of it, when they 
had given me an account how they had passed their time since 
their arriving in the island, especially after they had the misfor- 
tune to find that I was gone. He told me ne could not but. 
have some pleasure in my good fortune, when he heard that I was 
gone away in a good ship, and to my satisfaction ; and that he 
had oftentimes a strong persuasion, that one time or other he 
should see me again ; but nothing that ever befell him in his life 
was so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the disap- 
pointment he was under when he came back to the island, and 
found I was not there. 

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left 
behind, and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me, the 
Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the savages, 
only that their number was so small. " And," says he, "had they 
been strong enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory ;" 
and with that he crossed himself on the breast, *^But, sir,'' he 
added, " I hope you will not be displeased, when I shall tell you 
how, forced by necessity, we were obliged, for our own preserva- 
tion, to disarm them, and make them our subjects, who would 
not be content with being moderately our masters, but would be 
our murderers." I answered, " I was heartily afraid of it when 
I left them there ; and nothing troubled me at my parting from 
the island, but that they were not come back, that I might 
have put them in possession of every thing first, and left the 
other in a state of subjection, as they deserved ; but if they had 
reduced them to it, I was very glad, and should be very far from 
finding any fault with it; for I knew they were a parcel of 
refractory ungoverned villains, and werp fit for any manner of 
mischief." 

While I was saying this, came the man whom he had sent 
back, and with him eleven men more : in the dress they were in, 
it was impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he made 
all clear both to them and to me. First, he turned to me, and 
pointing to them, said, " These, sir, are some of the gentlemen 
who owe their lives to you ;" and then turning to them, and 
pointing to me, he let them know who I was ; upon which they 
all came up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordi- 
nary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they had been am- 
bassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch, or a great conqueror. 
Their behaviour was to the last degree obliging and courteous, 
and yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity, which very well 
became them ; and in short, they had so much more manners 
than I, that I scarcely knew how to receive their civilities, much 
ess how to return them in kind. 



214 ADVBHIORBB OF aOBINSON CBUSOE. PT. II. 

The history of their coming to nnd conduct in the island, after 
my going away, is so very remarkable, and hag bo many inci- 
dents, which the former part of my relation will help to under- 
stand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer to that 
accoont I have already given, that I cannot but commit them 
with great dehght to the reading of those that come after me. 



in Pharaoii'8 court : Dnt wben he sbewed them tbe 
arms, the powder, tbe ball, and the provisions that he brought 
them for tneir voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a 
juat share of the joy of their deliverancej and immediately pre- 
pared to come away with him. 



216 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

Their first business was to get canoes ; and in this they were 
obliged to trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow 
two large canoes, on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for 
pleasure. 

In these they came away the next morning. It* seems they 
wanted no time to get themselves ready, for they had no bae- 

fage, neither clothes, or provisions, or any thing in the world, 
ut what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they 
used to make their bread. 

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that time, un- 
luckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I 
mentioned in my other part, and to get off from the island ; 
leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungovemed, dis- 
agreeable villains behind me, that any man could desire to meet 
with, to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappointment, you 
may be sure. 

The only just thing the rogues did, was, when the Spaniards 
came on shore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them 
provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered them to do ; also 
they gave them the long paper of directions, which I had left 
witQ them, containing the particular methods which I took for 
managing every part of my life there ; nor did they refuse to 
accommodate the Spaniards with every thing else, for they agreed 
very well for some time. They gave them an equal admission 
into the house, or cave, and tney began to live very sociably ; 
and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my method, 
and Friday's father together, managed all their affairs: for, as 
for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the 
island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises ; and when they came 
home at night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for them. 

The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this, would the 
others have but let them alone ; which, however, they could not 
find in their hearts to do long ; but, like the dog in the manger, 
they would not eat themselves, and would not let others eat 
either. The differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, 
and such as are not worth relating ; but at last they broke out 
into open war, and began with all the rudeness and insolence 
that can be imagined, without reason, without provocation, con- 
trary to nature, and indeed to common sense : and though it is 
true the first relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, 
whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the 
fellows, they could not deny a word of it. 

But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply 
a defect in my former relation ; and this was, that I forgot to set 
down amonjr tlie rost, that, just us we were weighing the anchor 
to sot sail, thore happened u little quarrel on board our ship, 
which I vva.s afraid once would have turned to a second mutiny ; 
nor was it apijcosed till the captain, rousing up his courage, and 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 217 

taking us all to his assistance, parted them hy force, and making 
two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, laid them in irons ; 
and as they had been active in the former disorders, and let fall 
some dangerous words the second time, he threatened to carry 
them in irons to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny 
and running away with the ship. 

This, it seems, though the captain did not intend to do it, 
frightened some other men in the ship ; and some of them had 
put it into the heads of the rest, that the captain only gave them 
good words for the present, till they should come to some English 
port, and that then they should be all put into gaol, and tried for 
their lives. 

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it ; 
upon which it was desired that I, who still passed for a great 
man among them, should so down with the mate, and satisfy the 
men, and tell them that they might be assured, if they behaved 
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time past 
should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing my honour's 
word to them, they appeared easy; and the more so, when I 
caused the two men who were in irons to be released and for- 
given. 

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night, 
the wind also falling calm. Next morning we found that our two 
men who had been laid in irons had stolen each of them a musket 
and some other weapons, (what powder or shot they had, we 
knew not,) and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not yet 
hauled up, and ran away with her to their companions in roguery 
on the shore. 

As soon 2ifi we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, 
with twelve men and the mate ; and away they went to seek the 
rogues. But they could neither find them, nor any of the rest; 
for they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming 
on shore. The mate was once resolved, in punishment of their 
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt all their 
household-stuff and furniture, and left them to shift without it ; 
but having no order, he let it all alone, left every thing as he 
found it, and bringing the pinnace away, came on board without 
them. 

These two men made their number five ; but the other three 
villains were so much wickeder than these, that after they had 
been two or three days together, they turned their two new- 
comers out of doors to shift for themselves, and would have 
nothing to do with them : nor could they for a good while be 
persuaded to give them any food : as for the Spaniards, they were 
not yet come. 

When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began 
to go forward. The Spaniards would have persuaded the three 
English brutes to have taken in their two countrymen again^ 

u 



218 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

that, as they said, they might be all one family ; but they would 
not hear of it : so the two poor fellows lived by themselves ; and 
finding nothing but industry and application would make them 
live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of 
the island, but a little more to the west, to be out of the danger 
of the savages, who always landed on the east parts of the island. 

Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other 
to lay up their magazines and stores in ; and the Spaniards 
having given them some com for seed, and especially some of 
the peas which I had left them, they dug and planted, and en- 
closed after the pattern 1 had set for them all, and began to live 
pretty well. Their first crop of corn was on the ground ; and 
though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at 
first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve 
them, and find them with bread or other eatables ; and one of 
the fellows being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at 
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations, as the rice 
and the milk, and such fiesh as they got, enabled him to do. 

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the 
three unnatural scoundrels, their own countrymen too, in mere 
humour, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told 
. them the island was theirs ; that the governor, meaning me, had 
given them possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it ; 
and they should build no houses upon their ground, unless they 
would pay them rent for them. 

The two men thought they had jested at first ; asked them to 
come and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they 
had built, and tell them what rent they demanded ; and one of 
them merrily told them, if they were ground landlords, he hoped 
if the^ built tenements upon the land, and made improvements, 
they would, according to the custom of all landlords, grant them 
a long lease ; and bid them ^o fetch a scrivener to draw the 
writings. One of the three told them, with an oath, they should 
see they were not in jest ; and going to a little place at a dis- 
tance, where the honest men had made a fire to dress their vic- 
tuals, he took a firebrand, and clapping it to the outside of their 
hut, set it on fire ; and it would have been all burnt down in a 
few minutes, if one of the two had not run to the fellow, thrust 
him away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and that not with- 
out some difficulty too. 

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting 
him away, that he returned upon him with a pole he had in his 
hand ; and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and 
run into the hut, he had ended his days at once. His comrade, 
seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and im- 
mediately they came both out with their muskets ; and the man 
that was first struck at with the pole, knocked the fellow down 
that had begun the quarrel, with the stock of his musket, before 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRtJSOB. 219 

the other two could come to help him ; and then seeing the rest 
come at them, they stood together, and presenting the other end 
of their pieces to them, bade them stand off. 

The other had fire-arms with them too ; but one of the two 
honest men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his 
danger, told them, if they offered to move hand or foot, they 
were dead men ; and boldly commanded them to lay down their 
arms. They did not indeed lay down their arms; but, seeing 
him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and they consented 
to take their wounded man with them, and be gone ; and, indeed, 
it seems the fellow wasVounded suflBciently with the blow. How- 
ever, they were much in the wrong that they did not disarm them 
effectually, as they might have done, and have gone immediately 
to the Spaniards, and given them an account how the rogues had 
treated them ; for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, 
and every day gave them some intimation that they did so. 

But not to crowd the story with an account of the lesser part 
of their rogueries, such as treading down their corn, shooting 
three young kids, and a she-goat which the poor men had got to 
breed up tame for their store ; in a word, they plagued them night 
and day in such a manner, that it forced the two men to such a 
desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three the first 
time they had a fair opportunity. In order to this, they resolved 
to go to the castle, as they called it, that was my old dwelling, 
where the three rogues and the Spaniards all lived together at 
that time, intending to have a fair battle, and the Spaniards 
should stand by to see fair play. So they got up in the morning 
before day, and came to the place, and called the Englishmen by 
their names, telling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted 
to speak with them. 

It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, having 
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, 
for distinction, I call the honest men; and he had made a sad 
complaint to the Spaniards, of the barbarous usage they had met 
with from their three countrymen. When the Spaniards came 
home at night, and they were all at supper, one of them took the 
freedom to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle 
and mannerly terms ; and asked them, how they could be so cruel, 
they being harmless inoffensive fellows, and that they were only 
putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that 
it had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such per- 
fection as they had ? 

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, "What had 
they to do there ? That they came on shore without leave ; and 
that they should not plant or build upon the island ; it was none 
of their ground." ** Why," say* the Spaniard, very calmly, 
** Signer Inglese, they must not starve." The Englishman 
replied, like a true rough-hewn tarpaulin, they might starve 



220 LIFS AJTD ADTEXTUKES FT. II. 

«n/J welcome; for tbey gboold not plant or bnfld. ''Bat what 
rritJrtt th/;y do then, Signor?" says the Spaniard. Another of 
the hniien n turned, '^ Do! they should be sen^ant^, and work for 
them/' ** Hut how can yon expect that of them V says the 
Hj^Hniard ; ^' they are not bought with your money ; you have no 
rii^ht U) make them servants/' The Englishman answered, the 
inlatul waM theirn, the governor had given it to them, and no man 
IhuJ tiuy thing t^> do there but themselves. And with that swore 
thtit they would go and bum all their new huts; they should 
build none upon thfir land. 

** Why, Hignor/' says the Spaniard, "by the same rule, we 
muHt he your servants too." **Ay," says the bold dog, with 
an ottth, ** and so you shall too, before we have done with you." 
'i'he Spaniard only smiled at that, and made bim no answer. 
However, this little diHCOurse had heated them ; and starting up, 
oru! ( I think it was he they called Will Atkins) said to the other, 
** (Umw, Jack, let us go and have the other brush with them ; we 
will (lenioliHli their castle, I will warrant you; they shall plant 
no (X)lony in our dominions." Upon which they went all troop- 
hig away, each taking a gun, a pistol, and a sword. 

Whither they went, or how thejr occupied their time that 
ev(>ning, the S))aniards said they did not know ; but it seems 
tli(7 wandered about the country, part of the night ; and then 
lying down in the place which I used to call my bower, they 
w<«re weary, and overslept themselves. The case was this : they 
hud rrsolvod to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poor 
nH»n when they were asleep ; and as they acknowledged after- 
wiinls, they intended to set fire to their huts while they were in 
tluMu, und either burn them in them, or murder them as they 
oiuuo out : and, iis malice seldom sleeps ver^ sound, it was very 
HtriniLre thoy should not have been kept waking. 

lu^wever, ns the two men had also a design upon them, as I 
hnve said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and 
iiiurtlering, it hapi>enetl, and very luckily for them all, that they 
wert^ u)> and gone MbrtMid l>efore the ruffians came to their huts. 

When they ennie thert^ and found the men gone, Atkins, who, 
it seeuis« was the forwanlest man, called out to his comrades, 
** Hh) JMok« hertz's the nt^fit; but^ confound them, the birds are

stuff in pieces, and scattered every thing about in such a manner, 
that the poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile 
distant from their habitation. 

When they had done this, they rooted up all the young trees 
the poor men had planted ; pulled up an enclosure they had made 
to secure their cattle and their corn ; and, in a word, sacked and 
plundered every thing as completely as a herd of Tartars would 
have done. 

The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out, and 
had resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they 
were but two to three; so that, had they met, there certainly 
would have been bloodshed among them ; for they were all very 
stout resolute fellows, to give them their due. 

But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than 
they themselves could do to meet ; for as they had dogged one 
another, when the three were gone thither, the two were here ; and 
afterwards, when the two went back to find them, the three were 
come to the old habitation a^ain. We shall see their differing 
conduct presently. When the three came back, like furious 
creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they had been 
about put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told 
them what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and one 
of them stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a 
couple of boys at play, took hold of his hat, as it was upon his 
head, and giving it a twirl about, leering in his face, said to him, 
"And you, Signor Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce, 
if you do not mend your manners." The Spaniard, who, though 
a quiet civil man, was as brave as a man could desire, and 
withal strong and well-made, looked steadily at him for a good 
while ; and then, having no weapon in his hand, stept gravely up 
to him, and with one blow of his fist knocked him down, as an 
ox is felled with a pole-axe ; at which one of the rogues, insolent 
as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard immediately. He 
missed his body indeed, for the bullets went through his hair, but 
one of them touched the tip of his ear, and he bled pretty much. 
The blood made the Spaniard believe he was more hurt than he 
really was, and that put him into some heat, for before he acted 
all in a perfect calm ; but now resolving to go through with his 
work, he stooped and took the fellow's musket whom he had 
knocked down, and was just going to shoot the man who had 
fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being in the cave, 
came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they stepped in, se- 
cured the other two, and took their arms from them. 

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all 
the Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, 
they began to cool ; and giving the Spaniards better words, 
n<ked to have their arms again. But the Spaniards considering 
the feud that was between them and the other two Englishmen, 

Tr2 



222 I.IFB AND ADYENTT7RBS FT. II; 

and that it would be the best method they could take to keep 
them from killing one another, told them they would do them 
no harm ; and if they would live peaceably, they would be very 
willing to assist and associate with them, as tbey did before ; but 
that they could not think of giving them their arms again, while 
they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own 
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make them 
their servants. 

Being thus refused their request, the rogues went raving 
away, raging like madmen, and threatening what they would do, 
though they had no fire-arms ; but the Spaniards, despising their 
threatening, told them they should take care how tbey offered 
any injury to their plantation or cattle ; for if they did, they 
would shoot them, as they would do ravenous beasts, wherever 
they found them ; and if they fell into their hands alive, they 
should certainly be hanged. As soon as they were gone, the two 
men came back in passion enough also, though of another kind ; 
for, having been at their plantation, and finding it all demolished 
and destroyed, it will easily be supposed they had provocation 
enough. Tney could scarcely have room to tell their tale, the 
Spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs ; and it was strange 
enough to find, that tnree men should thus bully nineteen^ and 
receive no punishment at all. 

The Spaniards indeed despised them, and especially having 
thus disarmed them, made light of all their threatenings ; but 
the two Englishmen resolved to have their remedy against them, 
what pains soever it cost to find them out. 

But the Spaniards interposed, and told them that, as they 
had disarmed them, they could not consent that they (the two) 
should pursue them with fire-arms, and perhaps kill them. 
^* But,'* said the grave Spaniard who was their governor, "we 
will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you will leave 
it to us ; for as there is no doubt but they will come to us 
again when their passion is over, not being able to subsist with- 
out our assistance, we promise you to make no peace with them 
without having a full satisfaction for you ; and upon this condi- 
tion we hope you will promise to use no violence with them, 
other than in your defence." To which the two Englishmen 
yielded, though with great reluctance. 

In about five-days time the three vagrants, tired with wan- 
dering, and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on 
turtles' eggs all that ^hile, came back to the grove ; and finding 
my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and two 
more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they came up 
in a very submissive humble manner, and begged to be received 
again into the family. The Spaniards used them civilly, but told 
them, they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen, and 
80 very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they could not 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 223 

come to any conclusion without consulting the two Englishmen, 
and the rest ; but, however, they would go to them, and dis- 
course about it, and they should know in half an hour. 

After some consultation they were called in, and a long de- 
bate ensued, their two countrymen charging them with the ruin 
of all their labour, and a design to murder them ; all which they 
owned before, and therefore could not deny now. Upon the 
whole, the Spaniard acted the moderator between them ; and 
as they had obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three, 
while they were naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the 
three to go and build their fellows two huts, one to be of the 
same, and the other of larger dimensions than they were before ; 
to fence their ground again where they had pulled up the fences, 
plant trees in the room of those rooted up, dig up the land a^ain 
for planting corn, where they had spoiled it ; and, in a word, to 
restore every thing to the same state as they found it, as near as 
they could. 

Well, they submitted to all this ; and as they had plenty of 
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and 
the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably toge- 
ther ; only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to 
work for themselves, except now and then a little, just as they 
pleased. However, the Spaniards told them plainly, that if they 
would but live sociably and friendly together, ana study in the 
whole the good of the plantation, they would be content to work 
for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased. 
And thus, having lived pretty well together for a month or two, 
the Spaniards gave them their arms again, and liberty to go 
abroad with them as before. 

It was not above a week after they had their arms and went 
abroad, when the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and 
troublesome as before. However, an accident happened pre- 
sently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all : and 
obliged them to lay by all private resentments, and look to the 
preservation of their lives. 

It happened one night that the Spaniard (the governor) found 
himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any 
sleep : he was perfectly well in body, only found his thoughts 
tumultuous ; his mind ran upon men fighting and killing one 
another, and all the time he was broad awake : in short, he lay 
a great while ; at length, growing more and more uneasy, he 
resolved to rise. 

Having got up, he looked out, but it being dark, he could see 
little or nothing ; and, besides, the trees which I had planted in- 
tercepted his sight, so that he could only look up, and see that 
it was a clear starlight night ; and hearing no noise, he returned 
and laid him down again. But it was all one, he could not sleep, 
nor could he compose himself to any thing like rest, but his 



224 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. 11. " 

thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and yet he knew not 
for what. 

Havmg made some noise with rising and walking about, 
going out and coming in, another of the Spaniards waked, and, 
calling, asked who it was that was up. The governor told him 
how it had been with him. " Say you so?" says the other Spa^ 
niard ; " such things are not to be slighted, I assure you ; there 
is certainly some mischief working near us." And presently he 
asked him, " Where are the Engli^men ?" " They are all in 
their huts," says he, " safe enough." " Well," says the Spaniard, 
*^ there is something in it, I am persuaded from my own expe- 
rience. I am satisfied our spirits embodied have a converse with, 
and receive intelligence from, the spirits unembodied and inha- 
biting the invisible world ; and this friendly notice is given for 
our advantage, if we know how to make use of it. Come, let us 
^o out and look abroad ; and if we find nothing at all in it to 
justify our trouble, I will tell you a story to the purpose, that 
shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it." 

In a word, they went out to go up to the top of the hill, 
where I used to go ; but they, being strong, and in good com- 
pany, not alone as I was, used none of ray cautions to go up by 
the ladder, and then pulling it up after them, to go up a second 
stage to the top, but were going round through the grove uncon- 
cerned and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a 
light, as of fire, a very little way off" from them, and hearing the 
voices of men, not of one or two, but of a great number. 

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on 
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them from having 
the least idea of there being any inhabitant upon the place ; 
and when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so 
effectually, that they who got away were scarce able to give any 
account of it, for we disappeared as soon as possible ; nor did 
ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else, except it 
was the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into 
the boat, of whom I mentioned that I was afraid they should 
go home and bring more help. 

Whether it was in consequence of the escape of those men, 
that so great a number came now together ; or whether they 
came ignorantly, and by accident, on their usual horrid errand, 
the Spaniards could not understand. But whatever it was, it had 
been their business either to have concealed themselves, and not 
been seen by them at all, much less to have let the savages 
have seen that there were any inhabitants in the place ; or to 
have fallen upon them so effectually, as that not a man of them 
should have escaped, which could only have been done by getting 
in between them and their boats. But this presence of mind was 
wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a 
great while. 



CH. lU OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 225 

We need not doubt but that the ffovernor, and the man with 
him, surprised at this sight, ran back immediately, and roused 
their fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger 
they were all in. And they again as readily took the alarm ; but 
it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where 
they were, but that they must all run out to see how things 
stood. 

While it was dark, indeed, they were well enough, and they 
had opportunity, for some hours, to view the savages by the 
light of three nres they had made at some distance from one 
another. What they were doing they knew not, and what to do 
themselves they knew not ; for, first, the enemy were too many ; 
and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided into 
several parties, and were on shore in several places. 

The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight ; 
and as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the 
shore, they made no doubt but that, first or last, some of them 
would stumble upon their habitation, or some other place where 
they would see the token of inhabitants ; and they were in great 
perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would have 
been little less than starving them, if they should have been 
destroyed. So the first thing they resolved upon was, to despatch 
three men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniards and one 
Englishman, to drive all the goats away to the great valley where 
the cave was, and, if need were, into the cave itself. 

After havin? mused a great while on the course they should 
take, they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send the 
old savage (Friday's father) out as a spy, to learn, if possible, 
something concerning them, what they came for, and what they 
intended to do. Which the old man readily undertook, and, 
stripping himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away 
he went. After he had been gone an hour or two, he brought 
word, that he had been among them undiscovered ; that he found 
they were two parties, and of two several nations who had war 
with one another, and had had a great battle in their own coun- 
try ; and that both sides, having had several prisoners taken 
in the fight, were by mere chance landed all in the same island 
for the devouring their prisoners and making merry ; but their 
coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their 
mirth ; that they were in a great rage at one another ; and that 
they were so near, that he believed they would fight again as 
soon as daylight began to appear ; but he did not perceive that 
they had any notion of any body's being on the island but them- 
selves. He had hai'dly made an end of telling his story, when 
they could perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the 
two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight. 

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade 
our people to lie close^ and not be seen. He told them^ their 



I 
226 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 1 

safety consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie 
still, and the savages would kill one another to their bands, and 
then the rest would go away. And it was so to a tittle. But 
it was impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishnoien ; 
their curiosity was so great, that they must run out and see the 
battle ; however, they used some caution too, viz. they did not 
go openly just by their own dwelling, but went farther into the 
woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where they might 
securely see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, not 
be seen bv them ; but it seems the savages did see them, as we 
shall find hereafter. 

The battle was very fierce, and if I might believe the English- 
men, one of them said, he could perceive that some of the combat- 
ants were men of great bravery, of invincible spirits, and of great 
policy in guiding the fight. The fight, they said, lasted two hours 
nefore they could guess which party would be beaten ; but then, 
that party which was nearest our people's habitation began to ap- 
pear the weaker, and, after some time more, some of them began 
to fly. This put our men again into a great consternation, lest any 
of those that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling 
for shelter, and thereby discover the place ; and that by conse- 
quence the pursuers should do the like in search of them. Upon 
this they resolved, that they would stand armed within the wall, 
and whoever came into the grove, they should sally out over the 
wall, and kill them ; so that, if possible, not one should return 
to give an account of it: they ordered also, that it should be done 
wim their swords, or by knocking them down with the stock of 
the musket, but not by shooting them^ for fear of raising an 
alarm by the noise. 

As they expected, so it fell out ; three of the routed army fled 
for life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not 
in the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a 
thick wood for shelter. The s6out they kept to look abroad gave 
notice of this within, with this addition, to our men's great satis- 
faction, viz. that the conquerors had not pursued them, or seen 
which way they were gone. Upon this the Spaniard governor, 
a man of humanity, would not suffer them to kill the three fugi- 
tives ; but sending three men out by the top of the hill, ordered 
them to go round, and come in behind them, surprise and take 
them prisoners ; which was done. The residue of the conquered 
people fled to their canoes, and got ofi^to sea ; the victors retired, 
made no pursuit, or very little ; but drawing themselves into a 
body together, gave two great screaming shouts, which they sup- 
posed were by way of triumph, and so the fight ended ; and tne 
same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched 
to their canoes. 

After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their 
den ; and^ viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and* 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 227 

thirty dead men upon the spot. Some were killed with great 
long arrows, some of which were found sticking in their bodies ; 
but most of them were slain with their great wooden swords, 
sixteen or seventeen of which they found on the field of battle, 
and as many bows, with a great many arrows. These swords 
were strange great unwieldy things, and they must have been 
very strong men that used them. Most of those men that were 
killed with them had their brains knocked out, and several had 
their arms and legs broken ; so that it is evident they fight 
with inexpressible rage and fury. The Spaniards found not one 
wounded man that was not stone dead ; for either they stay by 
their enemy till they have quite killed him, or they carry all the 
wounded men, that are not quite dead, away with them. 

This deliverance tamed the three English brutes I have been 
speaking of for a great while : the sight had filled them with 
horror, and the consequences appeared terrible to the last degree, 
even to them, if ever they should fall into the hands of those 
creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies, but kill 
them for food, as we kill our cattle. 

For a time they were very tractable, and went about the 
common business of their whole society well enough ; planted, 
sowed, reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country. 
But some space after this, they fell all into such measures as 
brouc^ht them into a great deal of trouble. 

They had taken three prisoners, as I had observed ; and these 
three being lusty stout young fellows, they made them servants, 
and taught them to work for them ; and, as slaves, they did well 
enough. But they did not take their measures with them as I did 
by my man Friday, namely, to begin with them upon the prin- 
ciple of having saved their lives, and then instruct them in the 
rational principles of life, much less of religion, civilising and 
reducing them by kind usage and afi^ectionate arguings ; but, 
as they gave them their food every day, so they gave them their 
work too, and kept them fully employed in drudgery. But they 
failed in this by it, that they never had them to assist them and 
fight for them, as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me 
as the very flesh upon my bones. 

But to return. Being all now good friends (for common 
danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled them), they 
began to consider their general circumstances ; and the first 
thing that came under their consideration was, whether, seeing 
the savages particularly haunted that side of the island, and that 
there were more remote and retired parts of it equally adapted 
to their way of living, and manifestly to their advantage, they 
should not rather remove their habitation, and plant it in some 
more proper place for their security, and especially for the se- 
curity of their cattle and com. 

Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded, that they 



228 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. D. 

would not remove their habitation ; because that some time or i 
other they thought they might hear from their governor again, i 
meaning me: and if I should send any one to seek them, I | 
should be sure to direct them on that side> where, if they should ' 
find the place demolished, they would conclude the savages had 
killed them all. 

One piece of prudence they used, which it was very well they 
did ; namely, that they never trusted those three savages, whom 
they had made prisoners, with knowing any thing of the planta- | 
tion they had made in that valley, or ofany cattle they had there; 
much less of the cave there, which they kept in case of necessity, 
as a safe retreat ; and whither they carried also the two barrels 
of powder which I had sent them at my coming away. 

But, having resolved not to change their habitation, they vet 
agreed that, as I had carefully covered it, first with a wall or ror- 
tification, and then with a grove of trees ; so, seeing their safety 
consisted entirely in their being concealed, they set to work to 
conceal the place yet more efiectually than before. To this pur- 
pose, as I had planted trees for some good distance before the 
entrance into my apartment, they went on in the same manner, 
and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground, from the 
trees I had set, quite down to the side of the creek where I landed 
my floats, and even into the very ooze where the tide flowed, not 
so much as leaving any place to land, or any sign that there had 
been any landing thereabout. These stakes also being of a wood 
very forward to grow, as I had noted formerly, they took care to 
have them generally very much larger and taller than those which 
I had planted ; ana as they grew apace, so they planted them so 
very thick and close together, that when they had been three or 
four years grown, there was no piercing with the eye any consi- 
derable way into the plantation. As for that part which I had 
planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh ; and 
among them they placed so many other short ones, and so thick, 
that in a word it stood like a palisado a quarter of a mile thick, 
and it was next to impossible to penetrate it; for a little dog 
could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close. 

They did the same by all the ground to the right hand and to 
the left, and round even to the top of the hill ; leaving no way 
(not so much as for themselves to come out), but by the ladder 
placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted up, and placed 
again from the first stage up to the top : which ladder, when it 
was taken down, nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to 
assist it could come at them. 

This was excellently well contrived, nor was it less than what 
they afterwards found occasion for ; which served to convince 
nie, that as human prudence has the authority of Providence to 
justify if, so it has doubtless the direction of Providence to set 
it to work ; and, would we listen carefully to its voice, I am 



CH. II. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 229 

fully persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which 
our lives are now, hy our own negligence, subjected to. 

They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and had 
no more visits from the savages. They had indeed an alarm given 
them one morning, which put them into a great consternation ; 
for some of the Spaniards being out early one morning, on the 
west side, or rather the end of the island which was that part 
where I never went for fear of being discovered, they were sur- 
prised with seeing above twenty canoes of Indians just coming 
on shore. 

They made the best of their way home, in hurry enough ; 
and giving the alarm to their comrades, they kept close all that 
day and the next, going out only at night, to make observation. 
But they had the good luck to be mistaken ; for wherever the 
savages went, they did not land that time on the island, but pur- 
sued some other design. 

And now they had another broil with the three Englishmen ; 
one of whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage with one 
of the three slaves, because the fellow had not done something 
right which he bid him do, drew a hatchet out of a belt which 
he wore by his side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct 
him, but to kill him. One of the Spaniards, who was by, seeing 
hira give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he 
aimed at his head, but struck into his shoulder, so that he thought 
he had cut the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating 
him not to murder the poor man, stepped in between him and the 
savage, to prevent the mischief. 

The fellow, being the more enraged at this, struck at the 
Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve him as 
he intended to serve the savage ; which the Spaniard perceiving, 
avoided the blow, and with a shovel, which he had in his hand 
(for they were all working in the field about their corn-land), 
knocked the brute down : another of the Englishmen, running 
at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard 
down ; and then two Spaniards more came to help their man, 
and a third Englishman fell in upon them. They had none of 
them any fire-arms, or any other weapons but hatchets and 
other tools, except this third Englishman ; he had one of my old 
rusty cutlasses, with which he made at the two last Spaniards, 
and wounded them both. This fray set the whole family in an 
uproar; and more help coming in, they took the three English- 
men prisoners. The next question was, what should be done 
with them? They had been so often mutinous, and were so 
desperate, and so idle withal, that they knew not what course to 
take with them ; for they were mischievous to the highest degree, 
and cared not what hurt they did to any man ; so that, in short, 
it was not safe to live with them. 

The Spaniard, who was governor, told them in so many 

X 



230 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. I 

words, that if they had been his own countrymen he would hai 
hanged down ; for all laws and all governors were to presen 
society, and those who were dangerous to the society ought to I 
expelled out of it. But as they were Englishmen, and as it wi 
to the generous kindness of an Englishman that they all owe 
their preservation and deliverance, he would use them with a 
possible lenity, and would leave them to the judgment of tl 
other two Englishmen, who were their countrymen. 

One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and said the 
desired it might not be left to them ; for, says he, ** I am sui 
we ought to sentence them to the gallows." And vnth that I 
gave an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had propose 
to have all the five Englishmen join together and murder all tl 
Spaniards when they were in their sleep. 

When the Spanish governor heard this, he called to Atkin 
" How, Signor Atkins," says he, ** would you murder us all 
What have you to say to that ?" The hardened villain was i 
far from denying it, that he said it was true, and that they woo] 
do it still before they had done with them. ** Well but, Sign< 
Atkins," said the Spaniard, "what have we done to you, thatyc 
will kill us ? and what must we do to prevent you killing m 
Must we kill you, or you will kill us ? Why will you put us 1 
the necessity of this, Signor Atkins ?" 

Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making a jest < 
it, that, had he not been held by three men, and withal had i 
weapons near him, it was thought he would have attempted i 
have killed the Spaniard in the middle of all the company. 

This hair -brained carriage obliged them to consider serious] 
what was to be done. The two jblnglishmen and the Spaniai 
who saved the poor savage were of opinion they should hang oi 
of the three for an examj)le to the rest, and that particularly 
should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder wil 
his hatchet ; and, indeed, there was some reason to believe I 
had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable cor 
dition with the wound he had received, that it was thought li 
could not live. 

This, however, was positively eainsayed by the govem( 
Spaniard ; and as merciful counsels are most apt to preva 
where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came into it. Bi 
then it was to be considered what should be done to keep thei 
from doing the mischief they designed; for all agreed, govemc 
and all, that means were to be used for preserving the societ 
from danger. After a long debate, it was agreed, first, that the 
should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, c 
powder, or shot, or sword, or any weapon, and should be tume 
out of the society, and left to live where they would and how the 
would by themselves ; but that none of the rest, either Spaniard 
or English, should converse with them, or have any thing to d 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 231 

with them ; that they should be forbid to come within a certain 
distance of the place where the rest dwelt ; and that if they offered 
to commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any 
of the com, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to 
the society, they should die without mercy. 

The governor, a man of great humanity, musing upon the 
sentence, considered a little upon it; and turning to the two 
honest Englishmen, said, ^' Hold I you must reflect that it will be 
long ere they can raise corn and cattle of their own; and they 
must not starve; we must, therefore, allow them provisions. ' 
So he caused to be added, that they should have a proportion of 
corn given them to last them eight months, and for seed to sow, 
by which time they might be supposed to raise some of their 
own ; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, and 
six kids given them, as well for present subsistence as for a store ; 
and that they should have tools given them for their work in the 
field, such as six hatchets, an axe, a saw, and the like. But they 
should have none of these tools or provisions, unless they would 
swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the 
Spaniards with them, or their fellow Englishmen. 

Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to 
shift for themselves* They went away sullen and refractory, as 
neither contented to go away nor to stay ; but as there was no 
remedy, they went, pretending to go and choose a place where 
they should settle themselves, to plant and live by themselves ; 
and some provisions were given them, but no weapons. 

About four or five days after, they came again for some 
victuals, and told the governor where they had pitched their 
tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and plantation ; 
and it was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest part 
of the island, n.b., much about the place where I landed in my 
first voyage, when I was driven out to sea in my attempt to sail 
round the island. 

Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived 
them in a manner like my first habitation, being close under the 
side of a hill, having some trees growing already to the three 
sides of it ; so that by planting others, it would be very easily 
covered from the sight, unless narrowly searched for. They de- 
sired some dried goat-skins for beds and covering, which were 
given them ; and upon giving their word that they would not 
disturb the rest, or injure any of their plantations, they had 
hatchets and other tools given them; some peas, barley, and 
rice, for sowing ; and, in a word, every thing but arms and am- 
munition. 

They lived in this separate condition about six months, and 
had got in their first harvest, though the quantity was but small, 
the land they had planted being but little ; for, indeed, having all 
their plantation to form, they had a great deal of work upon 



( 



232 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. H. 

their hands ; and when they came to make boards, and pots, and 
such things, they were quite out of their element, and could make 
nothing of it. And now, when the rainy season came on, for 
want of a cave in the earth they could not keep^ their CTain dry, 
and it was in great danger of spoiling ; and this humbled tbem 
much. So they came and begged the Spaniards to help them; 
which they very readily did, and in four days worked a great hole 
in the side of the hill for them, big enough to secure their corn 
and other things from the rain. But it was but a poor place at 
best compared to mine, and especially as mine was then, for the 
Spaniards had greatly enlarged it, and made several new apart- 
ments in it. 

About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new 
frolic took these rogues, which, together with the former yillany 
they had committed, brought mischief enough among them, and 
haa very near been the ruin of the whole colony. The three new 
associates began, it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they 
led, and that without hope of bettering their circumstances ; and a 
whim took them, that they would make a voyage to the continent 
from whence the savages came, and would try if they could not 
seize upon some prisoners among the natives there, and bring 
them home, and make them do the laborious part of the work 
for them. 

The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no far- 
ther ; but they did nothing and proposed nothmg, but had either 
mischief in the design or mischief in the event. 

The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, 
and, in very humble terms, desired to be admitted to speak with 
them. The Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say ; 
which was this, that they were tired of living in the manner they 
did, that they were not handy enough to make the necessarief 
they wanted, and that having no help, they found they should be 
starved ; but if the Spaniards would give them leave to take one 
of the canoes which they came over in, and give them arms and 
ammunition proportioned for their defence, they would go over 
to the main and seek their fortune, and so deliver them from the 
trouble of supplying them with any other provisions. 

The Spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them : but yet 
very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they 
were running into ; told them they had suiFered such hardships 
upon that very spot, that they could, without any spirit of pro- 
phecy, tell them that they would be starved or murdered ; and 
bade them consider of it. 

The men replied audaciously, that they should be starved if 
they stayed here, for they could not and would not work, and 
they could but be starved abroad ; and if they were murdered, 
there was an end of them ; they had no wives or children to cry 
after them ; and, in short, insisted importunately upon their de- 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 233 

inand, declaring that they would go, whether they would give 
them arms or no. 

The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they 
were resolved to go, they should not go like naked men, and be in 
no condition to defend themselves ; and that though they could ill 
spare their fire-arms, having not enough for themselves, yet they 
would let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and 
each man a hatchet ; which they thought sufficient for them. 

They accepted the oflPer; and having baked for them bread 
enough to serve them a month, and given them as much goat*s 
flesh as they could eat while it was sweet, and a great basket 
full of dried grapes, a pot full of fresh water, and a young kid 
alive to kill, tney boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage over the 
sea, where it was at least forty miles broad. 

The boat was indeed a large one, and would have very well 
carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big 
for them to manage ; but as they had a fair breeze and the flood- 
tide with them, tney did well enough. They had made a mast 
of a long pole, and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which 
tliey had sewed or laced together ; and away they went merrily 
enough. The Spaniards called after them, " Bon veyajo !" and 
no man ever thought of seeing them any more. 

The Spaniards would often say to one another and the two 
honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and com- 
fortably they lived, now those three turbulent fellows were gone. 
As for their ever coming again, that was the remotest thing from 
their thoughts that could be imagined; when, behold, after 
twenty-two days' absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad 
upon his planting-work, saw three strange men coming towards 
him at a distance, two of them with guns upon their shoulders. 

Away ran the Englishman as if he was bewitched to the go- 
vernor bpaniard, and told him they were all undone, for there 
were strangers landed upon the island, they could not tell who. 
The Spaniard, pausing awhile, said, ** How do you mean, you 
cannot tell who? They are the savages, to be sure." " No, no," 
says the Englishman, ^' they are men in clothes, with arms." 
** Nay, then," says the Spaniard, " why are you concerned ? If 
they are not savages, they must be friends; for there is no 
Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than 
harm." 

While they were debating thus, the three Englishmen came, 
and standing without the wood which was new planted, hallooed 
to them. They presently knew their voices, and so all the won- 
der of that kind ceased. But now the astonishment was turned 
upon another question, namely, what could be the matter, and 
what made them come back again ? 

It was not long before they brought the men in ; and inquiring 
where they had been and what they had been doing, they gave 

x2 



234 LIFB AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

them a full account of their voyage in a few words, namely, that 
they reached the land in two days, or something less ; but finding 
the people alarmed at theil* coming, and preparing with bows 
and arrows to fight them, they durst not go on shore, but sailed 
on to the northward six or seven hours till they came to a great 
opening, by which they perceived that the land they saw from 
our island was not the main, but an island ; that entering that 
opening of the sea they saw another island on the right hand 
north, and several more west ; and being resolved to land some- 
where, they put over to one of the islands which lay west, and 
went boldly on shore ; that they found the people very courteous 
and friendly to them, and they gave them several roots and some 
dried fish, and appeared very sociable; and the women, as well 
as the men, were very forward to supply them with any thing 
they could get for them to eat, and brought it to them a great 
way upon their heads. 

They continued here four days, and inquired, as well as they 
could of them by signs, what nations were this way and that way ; 
and were told of several fierce and terrible ))eople that lived 
almost every way, who, as they made signs to them, used to eat 
men. But as for themselves, they said that they never eat men 
or women, except only such as they took in the wars ; and 
then they owned that they made a great feast, and eat their pri- 
soners. 

The Englishmen inquired when they had a feast of that kind ; 
and they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon, 
and then to two fingers ; and that their great king had two hun- 
dred prisoners now, which he had taken in his war ; and they 
were feeding them to make them fat for the next feast. The 
Englishmen seemed very desirous to see those prisoners ; but the 
other mistaking them, thought they were desirous to have some 
of them to carry away for their own eating. So they beckoned 
to them, pointing to the setting of the sun, and then to the rising ; 
which was to signify, that the next morning, at sun-rising, they 
would bring some for them ; and accordingly, the next morning, 
they brought down five women and eleven men, and gave them 
to the Englishmen to carry with them on their voyage, just as we 
would bring so many cows and oxen down to a sea-port town to 
victual a ship. 

As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their 
stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do ; 
to refuse the prisoners would have been the highest aifront to the 
savage gentry that offered them ; and what to do with them they 
knew not : however, upon some debate, they resolved to accept 
of them ; and, in return, they gave the savages that brought them 
one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of 
their bullets, which, though they did not understand, they seemed 
extremely, pleased withj and then, tying the poor creatures' 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 235 

hands behind them, they (the people) dragged the poor prisoners 
into the boat for our men. 

The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they 
had them, or else they that gave them this noole present would 
certainly have expected that they should have killed two or three 
of them the next morning, and perhaps have invited the donors 
to dinner. 

But, having taken their leave with all the respects and thanks 
that could well pass between people, where, on either side, they 
understood not one word they could say, they put off with their 
boat, and came back towards the first island, where, when they 
arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, there being 
too many of them for their occasion. 

In their voyage they endeavoured to have some communi- 
cation with their prisoners, but it was impossible to make them 
understand any thing ; nothing they could say to them, or give 
them, or do for them, but was looked upon as going about to 
murder them. They first of all unbound them; but the poor 
creatures screamed at that, especially the women, as if they had 
just felt the knife at their throats; for they immediately con- 
cluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed. 

When the three wanderers had given this unaccountable his- 
tory or journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them, where 
their new family was? And being told that they had brought 
them on shore, and put them into one of their huts, and were 
come up to beg some victuals for them ; they (the Spaniards) 
and the other two Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, 
resolved to go down to the place and see them, and did so, and 
Friday's father with them. 

When they came into the hut, there they sat all bound (for 
when the Englishmen had brought them on shore, they bound 
their hands, that they might not take the boat and make their 
escape) : first, there were three men, lusty, comely fellows, well- 
shaped, with straight and fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-five 
years of age, and five women, whereof two might be from thirty to 
forty, two more not above four or five and twenty, and the fifth, 
a tall, comely maiden, about sixteen or seventeen : the women 
were well-favoured agreeable persons, both in shape and features, 
only tawny ; and two of them, had they been perfectly white, 
would have passed for very handsome women even in London 
itself, having very pleasant agreeable countenances, and being of 
a very modest behaviour. 

The first thing the Spaniards did, was to cause the old Indian, 
Friday's father, to go in, and see, first, if he knew any of the cap- 
tives ; and then, if he understood any of their speech. As soon as 
the old man came in, he looked seriously at them, but knew none 
of them ; neither could any of them understand what he said, 
except two of the women. 



236 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. IT 

However, this was enough to answer the end, which was, t< 
satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallei 
were Christians; that they abhorred eating of men or women 
and that they might be sure they would not be killed. As sooi 
as they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and bj 
such awkward and several ways, as is hard to describe ; for h 
seems they were of several nations. 

The woman, who was their interpreter, was bid, in the nexi 
place, to ask them if they were willing to be servants, and tc 
work for the men who had brought them away, to save tbeii 
lives? At which they all fell a dancing; and presently one fel 
to taking up this, and another that, and any thing that lay next 
to carry on their shoulders, to intimate that they were willing 
to work. 

The governor now asked the three men, what they intended U 
do with these women, and how they intended to behave to them, 
whether as servants, or as wives? One of the Englishmen an' 
swered very boldly and readily, that they would treat them ai 
both. To which the governor said, " I am not going to restraii 
you from it ; you are your own masters as to that ; but this J 
think is but just, for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you 
and I desire it of you for that reason only, namely, that you wil 
all engage, that if any of you take any of these women, that h< 
shall take but one ; for though we cannot rightly marry any o 
you, yet it is but reasonable, that while you stay here, the womai 
any of you takes should l»e maintained by the man that takei 
her, ana should be his wife." All this appeared so just, tha 
every one agreed to it without any difficulty. 

Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards, if they designed t< 
take any of them ? But every one of them answered, " No ;' 
some of them said they had wives in Spain ; and the others die 
not like women that were not Christians. On the other hand, t< 
be short, the five Englishmen took them every one a wife ; and sc 
they set up a new form of living ; for the Spaniards and Friday't 
father lived in my old habitation, which they had enlarged ex- 
ceedingly within ; the three servants, that they had taken in 
the late battle of the savages lived with them ; and these carrie<] 
on the main part of the colony, supplying all the rest with food, 
and assisting them in any thing as they could, or as they found 
necessity required. 

But the wonder of this story was, how five such refractory, 
ill-matchi'd fellows should agree about these women, and that 
two of them should not pitch upon the same woman, especially/ 
seeing two or three of them were, without comparison, mor€ 
agreeable than the others. But they took a good enough way tc 
prevent quarrelling among themselves ; for they set the ^ve wo- 
men by themselves in one of their huts, and tney went all intc 
the other hut, and drew lots among them who should choose first. 



en. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 237 

He that drew to choose first, went away oy ftimself to the 
hut, where the poor creatures were, and fetched out her he 
choose. And it was worth observing, that he that chose first, 
took her that was reckoned the homeliest, and the oldest of the 
five ; which made mirth enough among the rest, and even the 
Spaniards laughed at it ; but the fellow considered better than 
any of them, that it was application and business, that they were 
to expect assistance in, as much as any thing else; and she 
proved the best wife of all the parcel. 

When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and 
fetched out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned 
upon them again, and they firmly believed that they were now 
going to be devoured. Accordingly, when the English sailor 
came in and fetched out one of them, the rest set up a most 
lamentable cry, and hung about her, and took their leave of her 
with such agonies and such affection as would have grieved the 
hardest heart in the world ; nor was it possible for the English- 
men to satisfy them that they were not to be immediately mur- 
dered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's father, who in- 
stantly let them know, that the five men who had fetched them 
out one by one, had chosen them for their wives. 

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was 
a little over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and 
helped them ; and in a few hours, they had built them every one 
a new hut or tent for their lodging apart; for those they had 
already were crowded with their tools, household stufi^, and pro- 
visions. The three wicked ones had pitched farthest off; and the 
two honest ones nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, 
so that they continued separated as before. And thus my island 
was peopled in three places, and, as I might say, three towns 
were begun to be planted. 

And nere it is very well worth observing that, as it often hap- 
pens in the world (what the wise ends of God's providence are in 
such a disposition of things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows 
had the two worst wives ; and the three reprobates, that were 
scarce worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed 
born to do themselves good or any one else, had three clever, 
diligent, careful, and ingenious wives. Not that the two first 
were ill wives as to their temper or humour ; for all the five were 
most willing, quiet, passive, and subjected creatures, rather like 
slaves than wives ; but my meaning is, they were not alike capa- 
ble, ingenious, or industrious, or alike cleanly and neat. 

Another observation I must make, to the honour of a diligent 
application on one hand, and to the disgrace of a slothful, negli- 
gent, idle temper on the other: that when I came to the place, and 
viewed the several improvements, planting, and management of 
the several little colonies, the two men had so far outgone the 
three, that there was no comparison. They had indeed both of 



238 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

theni as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted ; and the 
reason was, because, according to my rule, nature dictated that 
it was to no purpose to sow more com than their wants required; 
but the difference of the cultivation, of the planting, of the fences, 
and indeed of every thing else, was easy to be seen at first view. 

The two men had innumerable young trees planted aboat 
their huts, so that when you came to the place nothing was to be 
seen but a wood ; and though they had twice had their plantation 
demolished, once by their own countrymen, and once by the 
enemy, as shall be shewn in its place, yet they had restored all 
again, and every thing was thriving and flourishing about them. 
They had grapes planted in order, and managed like a vineyard, 
though thev had themselves never seen any thing of that kind; 
and by their good ordering their vines, their grapes were as good 
again as any of the others. They had also found themselves 
out a retreat in the thickest part of the woods, where, though 
there was not a natural cave, as I had discovered, yet they msSe 
one with incessant labour of their hands, and where, when the 
mischief which followed happened, they secured their wives and 
children, so as they could never be found ; they having, by 
sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood, which, as I 
said, grew so easily, made the wood impassable, except in one 
place, where they climbed up to get over the outside part, and 
then went in by ways of their own leaving. 

As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they 
were much civilised by their new settlement compared to what 
they were before, and were not so quarrelsome (having not the 
same opportunity), yet one of the certain companions of a profli- 
gate mind never left them, and that was their idleness. It is true 
they planted corn, and made fences ; but Solomon's words were 
never better verified than in them : " I went by the vineyard of 
the slothful — it was all overgrown with thorns ;" for when the 
Spaniards came to view their crop, they could not see it in some 
places for weeds ; the hedge had several gaps in it, where the 
wild goats had got in and eiaten up the corn ; perhaps here and 
there a dead bush was crammed in, to stop them out for the pre- 
sent, but it was only shutting the stable-door after the steed was 
stolen. Whereas, when they looked on the colony of the other 
two, there was the very face of industry and success upon all 
they did : there was not a weed to be seen in all their com, or a 
gap in any of their hedges ; and they, on the other hand, veri- 
fied Solomon's words in another place, that " the hand of the 
diligent maketh rich ;" for every thing grew and thrived, and 
they had plenty within and without ; they had more tame cattle 
than the others, more utensils and necessaries within doors, and 
yet more pleasure and diversion too. 

It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly 
within doors ; and having learned the English ways of dressing 



CH. it. OF ROBINSON CBUSOE. 239 

and cooking from one of the Englishmen, who had been cook's 
mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands' victuals 
very nicely and well. But as for the husbands of the three wives, 
they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught fish and 
birds ; in a word, did anything but labour; and they fared accord- 
ingly. The diligent lived well and comfortable ; and the slothful 
lived hard and beggarly ; and so I believe, generally speaking, 
it is all over the world. 

But I now come to a scene different from all that had hap- 
pened before, either to them or me ; and the original of the story 
was this. 

Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of 
savages ; and there is no room to doubt they came upon the old 
errand of feeding upon their slaves. But that part was now so 
familiar to the Spaniards, and to our men too, that they did not 
concern themselves about it, as I did ; and having been made sen- 
sible by their experience, that their only business was to lie con- 
cealed while the savages stayed on the island, they had nothing 
to do but to give notice to the people in all the three plantations 
to keep within doors, and not to shew themselves ; only placing 
a scout in a proper place^ to give notice when the boats went to 
sea again. 

This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled 
all these measures, and made it kiiown among the savages, that 
there were inhabitants there ; which was, in the end, the deso- 
lation of almost the whole colony. After the canoes with the 
savages were gone off, the Spaniards peeped abroad again ; and 
some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they 
had been, to see what they had been doing. Here, to their 
^reat surprise, they found three savages left behind, and lying 
fast asleep upon the ground. It was supposed they had either 
been so gorged with their inhuman feast, that, like beasts, they 
were asleep, and would not stir when the others went ; or they 
had wandered into the woods, and did not come back in time 
to be taken in. 

The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight, and per- 
fectly at a loss what to do. The Spaniard governor, as it hap- 
])ened, was with them, and his advice was asked ; but he pro- 
fessed he knew not what to do : as for slaves, they had enough 
already ; and as to killing them, they were none of them in- 
clined to that. The Spaniard governor told me they could not 
think of sheddin? innocent blood ; for as to them the poor crea- 
tures had done them no wrong, invaded none of their property ; 
and they thought they had no just quarrel against them to take 
away their lives. 

And here I must, in justice to these Spaniards, observe that, 
lot the accounts of Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what 
they will, I never met with seventeen men of any nation what- 



240 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

soever, in any foreign country, who were so universally modest, 
temperate, virtuous, so very good-humoured, and so courteous, 
as these Spaniards : and as to cruelty, they had nothing of it in 
their very nature; no inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous 
passions ; and yet all of them were men of great courage and spirit. 

Their temper and calmness had appeared in their bearing the 
insufferable usage of the three Englishmen ; and their justice 
and humanity appeared now in the case of the savages as above. 
After some consultation, they resolved that they would lie still a 
while longer, till, if possible, these three men might be gone ; 
but then the governor Spaniard recollected that the three savages 
had no boat ; and that if they w^ere left to rove about the island, 
they would certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it, 
ana so they should be undone that way. Upon this they went 
back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep still. So they 
resolved to waken them, and take them prisoners ; and they did 
so. The poor fellows were strangely frightened when they were 
seized upon and bound, and afraid, like the women, that they 
should be murdered and eaten ; for, it seems, those people think 
all the world does as they do, eating men's flesh : but thej' wore 
soon made easy as to that ; and away they carried them. 

It was very happy for them tnat they did not carry them 
home to their castle — I mean, to my palace under the bill ; but 
they carried them first to the bower, where was the chief of their 
country work, such as the keeping the goats, the planting the 
corn, &c. ; and afterwards they carried them to the habitation of 
the two Englishmen. 

Here they were set to work, though it was not much they had 
for them to do : and whether it was by negligence in guarding 
tliem, or that they thought the fellows could not mend themselves, 
I know not, but one of them ran away, and, taking to the woods, 
they could never hear of him more. 

They had good reason to believe he got home again soon 
after in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on 
shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on 
their revels as usual, went off again in two-days time. This 
thought terrified them exceedingly ; for they concluded, and that 
not without good cause indeed, that if this fellow got safe home 
among his comrades, he would certainly give them an account 
that there were people in the island, as also how weak and few 
they were ; for this savage, as I observed before, had never been 
told, and it was very happy he had not, how many they were, or 
where they lived, nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any 
of their guns, much less had they shewn him any of their other 
retired ])laces, such as the cave in the valley, or the new retreat 
which the two Englishmen had made, and tlie like. 

The first testimony they had, that this fellow had given intel- 
ligence of them, was, that about two months alter this, six conoei 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 241 

of savages, with about seven or eight or ten men in a canoe, 
came rowing along the north side of the island, where they never 
used to come before, and landed about an hour after sun-rise, at 
a convenient place, about a mile from the habitation of the two 
Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept. As the Spa- 
niard governor said, had they been all there, the damage would 
not have been so much, for not a man of them would have 
escaped : but the case differed now very much ; for two men to 
fifty was too much odds. The two men had the happiness to 
discover them about a league off, so that it was above an hour 
before they landed ; and as they landed a mile from their huts, it 
was some time before they could come at them. Now, having 
great reason to believe that they were betrayed, the first thing 
they did was to bind the two slaves which were left, and cause 
two of the three men, whom they brought with the women, who, 
it seems, proved very faithful to them, to lead them with their two 
wives, and whatever they could carry away with them, to their re- 
tired place in the woods, which I have spoken of above, and there 
to bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard farther. 

In the next place, seeing the savages were all come on shore, 
and that they bent their course directly that way, they opened 
the fences where their milch-goats were kept, and drove them all 
out, leaving their goats to straggle into the woods, whither they 
pleased, that the savages might think they were all bred wildf. 
But the rogue who came with them was too cunning for that, and 
gave them an account of it all ; for they went directly to the 
place. When the two poor frightened men had secured their 
wives and goods, they sent the other slave they had, of the three 
who came with the women, and who was at their place by acci- 
dent, away to the Spaniards with all speed, to give them the 
alarm, and desire speedy help ; and, in the mean tiipe, they took 
their arms, and what ammunition they had, and retreated towards 
the place in the wood where their wives were sent, keeping at a 
distance ; yet so that they might see, if possible, which way the 
savages took. 

They had not gone far, when from a rising ground they 
could see the little army of their enemies come on directly to 
their habitation, and in a moment more could see all their huts 
and household-stuff flaming up together, to their great grief and 
mortification ; for they had a very great loss, to them irretriev- 
able, at least for some time. They kept their station for awhile, 
till they found the savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves 
all over the place, rummaging every way, and every place they 
could think of, in search for prey; and, in particular, for the 
people, of whom it now plainly appeared they had had intel- 
ligence. 

The two Englishmen seeing this, and thinking themselves not 
secure where they stood, as it was likely some of the wild people 

Y 



242 LIFB AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

might come that way, so they might come too many toother, 
thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile fisur- 
ther, believing, as it afterwards happened^ that the farther they 
strolled, the fewer would be together. 

The next halt was at the entrance into a very thick-grown 
part of the woods, and where an old trunk of a tree stood , which 
was hollow and vastly large ; and in this tree they both took their 
stand, resolving to wait and see what might offer. 

They had not stood there long, before two of the savages 
appeared, running directly that way, as if they had already had 
notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack them; 
and a little way farther they spied three more coming after them, 
and five more beyond them, all coming the same way ; besides 
which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance running another 
way ; for, in a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen beating 
for their game. 

The poor men were now in great perplexity, whether they 
should stand and keep their posture, or fly ; but after a very 
short debate with themselves, tney considered, that if the savages 
ranged the country thus, before help came, they might, perhaps, 
find out their retreat in the woods, and then all would be lost; 
so they resolved to withstand them there ; and if there were too 
many to deal with, then they would get to the top of the tree, 
from whence they doubted not to defend themselves as long as 
their ammunition lasted, though all the savages that were landed 
(nearly fifty in number) were to attack them. 

Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they 
should fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the 
middle party ; by which the two and the five that followed would 
be separated : and they resolved to let the first two pass by, 
unless they should spy them in the tree, and come to attack 
them. The first two savages also confirmed them in this de- 
termination, by turning a little from them towards another part 
of the wood ; but the three, and the five after them, came for- 
wards directly to the tree, as if they had known the Englishmen 
were there. 

Seeing them come so straight towards them, they resolved to 
take them in a line as they came ; and as they resolved to fire 
but one at a time, perhaps the first shot might hit them all 
three ; to which purpose, the man who was to fire put three or 
four small bullets into his piece, and having a fair loophole, as it 
were, from a broken hole m the tree, he took a sure aim, with- 
out being seen, waiting till they were within about thirty yards 
of the tree, so that he could not miss. 

While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, 
they plainly saw that one of the tnree was the runaway savage 
that had escaped from them, and they both knew him distinctly, 
and resolved that^ if possible, he should not escape, though they 



CH. II. OF B0BIN80N CRUSOE. 243 

should both fire; so the other stood ready with his piece, that 
if he did not drop at the first shot, he should be sure to have a 
second. 

But the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim ; for 
as the savages kept near one another, a little behind in a line, he 
fired, and hit two of them directly: the foremost was killed out- 
right, bein^ shot in the head ; the second, which was the run- 
away Indian, was shot through the body, and fell, but was not 
quite dead:, and the third had a little scratch on the shoulder, 
perhaps by the same ball that went through the body of the 
second ; and being dreadfully frightened, though not much hurt, 
sat down upon the ground, screaming and yelling in a hideous 
manner. 

The ^ve that were behind, more frightened with the noise 
than sensible of the danger, stood still at first ; for the woods 
made the sound a thousand times greater than it really was ; the 
echoes rattling from one side to another, and the fowls rising 
from all parts, screaming, and making every sort a several kind 
of noise, according to their kind ; just as it was when I fired the 
first gun that, perhaps, was ever shot ofi in that place since it was 
an island. 

However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what 
the matter was, came on unconcerned till they came to the place 
where their companions lay, and here the poor creatures, not 
sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief, stood 
nil of a huddle over the wounded man, talking, and as may be 
supposed, inquiring of him how he came to be hurt ; and who, 
'tis very rational to believe, told them that a fiash of fire first, 
and immediately after that, thunder from their gods, had killed 
those two and wounded him. This, I say, is rational; for nothing 
is more certain than that, as they saw no man near them, so they 
had never heard a gun in all their lives, or so much as heard of 
a gun ; neither knew they any thing of killing or wounding at a 
distance, with fire and bullets ; if they had, one might reason- 
ably believe, that they would not have stood so unconcerned, in 
viewing the fate of their fellows, without some apprehension of 
their own. 

Our two men, though, as they confessed to me, it grieved 
them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures, who at the 
same time had no notion of their danger ; yet, having them all 
thus in their power, and the first having loaded his piece again, 
resolved to let fiy both together among them ; and singling out 
by agreement which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or 
very much wounded, four of them: the fifth, frightened even to 
death, though not hurt, fell with the rest ; so that our men, see-^ 
ing them allfall together, thought they had killed them all. 

The belief that the savages were all killed, made our two men 
come boldly out from the tree before ^ey had charged their gund 



244 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. IL 

again, which was a wrong step ; and they were under some sat' 
prise, when they came to the place, and found no less than four 
of the men alive, and of them, two very little hurt, and one not 
at all : this obliged them to fall upon them with .the stocks of 
their muskets ; and first, they made sure of the runaway savage, 
who had been the cause of all the mischief ; and of another thst 
was hurt in his knee, and put them out of their pain. Then the 
man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them, 
with his hands held up, and made piteous moans to them, by 
gestures and signs, for his life. 

They signed to him to sit down at the foot of a tree close by ; 
and one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope- twine which he 
had in his pocket, tied his feet fast together, and his hands be- 
hind him, and there they left him ; and, with what speed they 
could, made after the other two, who were gone before, fear- 
ing lest they, or an^ more of them, should find the way to 
their covered place m the woods, where their wives and the 
few goods they had left lay. They came once in sight of the 
two men, but it was at a great distance : however, they had 
the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley, towaids the sea, 
the quite contrary way from that which led to their retreat; 
and, being satisfied with that, they went back to the tree where 
they left their prisoner, who, as they supposed, was delivered 
by his comrades ; for he was gone, and the two pieces of rope- 
yarn, with which they had bound him, lay just at the foot of the 
tree. 

They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing 
what course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in 
what numbers ; so they resolved to &:o away to the place where 
their wives were, to see if all was well there, and to make them 
easy, who were in fright enough to be sure ; for though the 
savages were their own country folk, yet they were most terribly 
afraid of them, and perhaps the more from the knowledge they 
had of them. 

When they came there, they found the savages had been in 
the wood, and near that place, but had not found it; for it was, 
indeed, inaccessible, by the trees standing so thick, as aforesaid, 
had not the persons seeking it been directed by those that knew 
it, which these did not : they found, therefore, every thing very 
safe, onlv the women in a terrible fright. While they were here, 
they had the comfort to have seven of the Spaniards come to 
their assistance ; the other ten, with their servants, and old Fri- 
day, I mean Friday's father, were gone in a bodv to defend their 
bower, and the corn and cattle that was kept there, in case the 
savages should have roved over to that side of the country. With 
the seven Spaniards came one of the three savages, who, as I said, 
were their prisoners formerly, and with them also came the savage 
that the Englishman had left bound hand and foot at the tree ; 



CH. II. OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 245 

for it seems they came that way, saw the slaughter of the seven 
men, and unbound the eighth, and brought him along with them, 
where, however, they were obliged to bind him again, as they 
had the two others who were left when the third ran away. 

The prisoners began now to be a burden to them ; and they 
were so afraid of their escaping, that they were near resolving to 
kill them all, believing they were under an absolute necessity to 
do so, for their own preservation. However, the Spaniard go- 
vernor would not consent to it ; but ordered, for the present, that 
they should be sent out of the way to my old cave in the valley, 
and be kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and give 
them food tor their subsistence : which was done, and they were 
bound there hand and foot for that night. 

When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so en- 
couraged that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any 
longer there ; but taking five of the Spaniards, and themselves, 
with four muskets and a pistol among them, and two stout quar- 
ter-staves, away they went in quest of the savages. First, they 
came to the tree where the men lay that had been killed ; and it 
was easy to see that some more of the savages had been there ; 
for they had attempted to carry their dead men away, and had 
dragged two of them a good way, but had given it over. From 
thence they advanced to the first rising ground, where they had 
stood and seen their camp destroyed, and where they had the 
mortification still to see some of the smoke ; but neither could 
they here see any of the savages. They then resolved, though 
with all possible caution, to go forward towards their ruined 
plantation ; but a little before they came thither, coming in siijht 
of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the savages all embarkmg 
again in their canoes. 

They seemed sorry at first ; and there was no way to come at 
them, to give them a parting blow ; but, upon the whole, they 
were very well satisfied to be rid of them. 

The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their 
improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help 
them to rebuild, and to assist them with needful supplies. Their 
three countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least 
inclination to do any good, yet, as soon as they heard of it (for 
they, living remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till 
all was over), came and offered their help and assistance, and 
did work very friendly for several days, to restore their habita- 
tion ; and thus, in a little time, they were set upon their legs 
again. 

It was Eve or six months after this, before our men heard 
any more of the savages ; when, on a sudden, they were invaded 
with a most formidable fleet, of no less than eight and twenty 
canoes full of savages, armed with bows and arrows, great clubs, 
wooden swords, and such like engines of war ; and they brought 

y2 



246 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. 11. 

such numbers with thcm^ that^ in shorty it put all onr people into 
the utmost consternation. 

As they came on shore in the evening, and at the eastemmoet 
side of the island, our men had that ni^ht to consult and consider 
what to do ; and in the first place, knowing that their bein^ 
entirely concealed was their only safety before, and would mo^ 
more be so now, while the number of their enemies was so 
great, they therefore resolved first of all, to take down the huts 
which were built for the two Englishmen, and drive away their 
goats to the old cave ; because they supposed the savages would 
go directly thither, as soon as it was day, to pla^ the old game 
over again, though they did not now land within two leagoei 
of it. 

In the next place, they drove awav all the flock of goats they 
had at the old bower, as I called it, which belonged to the Spani- 
ards; and, in short, left as little appearance of inhabitants any 
where as was possible. The next morning early they posted 
themselves with all their force at the plantation of the two men, 
and waited for their coming. As they guessed, so it happened ; 
these new invaders, leaving their canoes at the east end of die 
island, came ranging along the shore, directly towards the place, 
to the number of two hundred and fifty, as near as our men could 
judge. Our army was but small indeed ; but, that which was 
worse, thev had not arms for all their number. The whole ac- 
count stooci thus: 

First as to men, — Seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old 
Friday, the three slaves taken witii the women, and three other 
slaves who lived with the Spaniards. 

To arm these they had eleven muskets, five pistols, three 
fowling-pieces, five muskets or fowling-pieces which were taken 
by me from the mutinous seamen whom I reduced, two swords, 
and three old halberts. 

To their slaves thev did not give either musket or fusee, but 
they had every one a halbert, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff, 
with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his 
side a hatchet ; also every one of our men had hatchets. Two 
of the women could not be prevailed upon but they would come 
into the fight ; and they had bows and arrows, which the Spani- 
ards had taken from the savages, when the first action happened, 
which I have spoken of, where the Indians fought with one ano- 
ther ; and the women had hatchets too. 

The Spaniard governor commanded the whole ; and Atkins, 
who, though a wicked fellow, was most daring and bold, com- 
manded under him. The savages came forward like lions, and 
our men had no advantage in their situation ; only that Will 
Atkins, with six men, was planted just behind a small thicket of 
bushes as an advanced ^uard, with orders to let the first of them 
pass by, and then fire into the middle of them ; and, as soon as 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 247 

he had fired, to make his retreat as nimhly as he could, roand a 
part of the wood, and so come in behind the Spaniards where 
they stood, having a thicket of trees also before them. 

When the savages came on, they ran stragorling about every 
way in crowds, out of all manner of order ; and Atkins let about 
fifty of them pass by him ; then, seeing the rest come in a very 
thick throng, he ordered three of his men to fire, having loaded 
their muskets with six or seven bullets a-piece, about as bi^ as 
large pistol-bullets. How many they killed or wounded, they 
knew not ; but the consternation and surprise was inexpressible 
among the savages, to hear such a dreadful noise, and see some 
of their countrymen killed, and others hurt, yet be unable to 
see any body that did it. In the middle of their fright, Atkins, 
and the other three, let fly again among the thickest of them ; 
and in less than a minute, the other three being loaded again, 
gave them a third volley. 

Had Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they 
had fired, as they were ordered to do ; or had the rest of the body 
been at hand to have poured in their shot continually, the savages 
had been efiectually routed ; for the terror that was among them 
came principally from this notion, namely, that they were killed 
by the gods with thunder and lightning, and could see nobody 
that hurt them ; but Atkins staying to load again, discovered 
the cheat : some of the savages, who were at a distance, spying 
them, came upon them behind ; and though Atkins and his men 
fired at them also, two or three times, and killed, about twenty, 
retiring as fast as they could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, 
and killed one of bis tellow Englishmen with their arrows, as they 
did afterwards one Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who 
came with the women. 

Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two 
other men killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood ; and 
the Spaniards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also ; 
for the number of the savages was so great, and they were so 
desperate, that, though above fifty of them were killed, and more 
than as many wounded, yet the}'^ came on in the teeth of our 
men, fearless of danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and 
it was obierved, that their wounded men, who were not quite 
disabled, were made outrageous by their wounds, and fought 
like madmen. 

When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the 
Englishman, that were killed, behind them; and the savages, 
when they came up to them, killed them over again in a shocking 
manner, breaking their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs 
and wooden swords, like true savages. But, findinff our men 
were gone, they did not seem to pursue them, but drew them- 
selves up in a Kind of a ring, which is, it seems, their custom; 
and shouted twice, in token of their victory; after which, they 



248 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. 11. 

had the mortification to see several of their wounded men M, 
dying with the mere loss of blood. 

The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up to- 
gether upon a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, 
would have marched, and charged them again all together at 
once ; but the Spaniard replied, ** Signor Atkins, you see how 
their wounded men fight ; let them alone till morning ; all these 
wounded men will be stiff and - sore with their wounds, and 
faint with the loss of blood ; and so we shall have the fewer to 
engage." 

The advice was good ; but Atkins replied merrily, ** That is 
true, Signor, and so shall I too ; and that is the reason I would 
go on while I am warm." "Well, Signor Atkins," says the 
Spaniard, "you have behaved gallantly, and done your part; 
we will fight for you, if you cannot come on ; but I tnink it best 
to stay till morning." So they waited. 

But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the 
savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men, 
and a great hurry and noise among them where they lay, they 
afterwards resolved to fall upon them in the night, especially if 
they could come to give them but one volley before they were 
discovered ; which they had a fair opportunity to do ; for one 
of the two Englishmen, in whose quarter it was where the fight 
began, led them round between the woods and the sea-side, west- 
ward, and then turning short south, they came so near where the 
thickest of them lay, that before they were seen or heard, eight 
of them fired in among them, and did dreadful execution ; in 
half a minute more eight others fired after them, pouring* in their 
small shot in such a quantity, that abundance were killed and 
wounded ; and all this time they were not able to see who hurt 
them, or which way to fly. 

The Spaniards charged again, with the utmost expedition, 
and then divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to 
fall in among them all together; they had in each body eight 
persons, that is to say, twenty-four, whereof twenty-two were 
men, and two women, who, by the way, fought desperately. 

They divided the fire-arms equally in each party, and so of 
the halberts and staves. They would have had the women keep 
back ; but they said, they were resolved to die with their hus- 
bands. Having thus formed their little army, they marched out 
from among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, 
shouting and hallooing as loud as they could. The savages stood 
all together, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise 
of our men shouting from three quarters together. They would 
have fought if they had seen them ; and, as soon as they came near 
enough to be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday 
was wounded, though not dangerously. ' But our men gave them 
no time ; but running up to them, fired among them three ways, 



Cff. II. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 249. 

and then fell in with the butt-ends of their muskets, their swords, 
armed staves and hatchets ; and laid about them so well, that, in 
a word, they set up a dismal screaming and howling, flying to 
save their lives which way soever they could. 

Our men were tired with the execution ; and killed, or mor- 
tally wounded, in the two fights, about 180 of them ; the rest 
being scared out of their wits, scoured through the woods, and 
over the hills, with all the speed fear and nimble feet could help 
them to do ; and as our people did not care much to pur- 
sue them, they got all together to the sea-side, where they landed, 
and where their canoes lay. But their disaster was not at an 
end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from 
the seaward ; so that it was impossible for them to go off; nay, 
the storm continuing all night, when the tide came up, their 
canoes were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high 
upon the shore that it required intinite toil to get them of!'; and 
some of them were even dashed to pieces against the beach or 
against one another. 

Our men, though glad of their victory, yet ffot little rest that 
night; but having refreshed themselves as well as they could, 
they resolved to march to that part of the island where the 
savages were fled, and see what posture they were in. This 
necessarily led them over the place where the fight had been, 
and where they found several of the poor creatures not quite 
dead, and yet past recovering life ; a sight disagreeable enough 
to generous minds; for a truly great man, though obliged by 
the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no delight in his 
misery. 

At length they came in view of the place where the more 
miserable remains of the savages' army lay. Here there appeared 
about one hundred still ; their posture was generally sitting upon 
the ground, with their knees up towards their mouth, and the 
head put between the two hands, leaning down upon the knees. 

When our men came within two musket-shot of them, the 
Spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired without ball, 
to alarm them ; this he did that by their countenance he might 
know what to expect, viz. whether they were still in heart to 
fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and discou- 
raged, and so he might manage accordingly. 

This stratagem took; for, as soon as the savages heard the 
first gun, and saw the flash of the second, they started up upon 
their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable ; and, as our 
men advanced swiftly towards them, they all ran screaming and 
yelling away, with a kind of howling noisfe, which our men did 
not understand, and had never heard before ; and thus they ran 
up the hills into the country. 

At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, 
and they had all gone away to sea; but they did not then con- 



250 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. U. 

aider that this might probably have been the occasion of their 
coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at 
least, to come so many and so often as would quite desolate the 
island, and starve them. Will Atkins, therefore, who, notwith- 
standing his wound, kept always with them, proved the best 
counsellor in this case; his advice was, to take the advantage 
that offered, and clap in between them and their boats, and 80 
deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any more to plague 
the island. 

They consulted long about this, and some were against it, for 
fear of making the wretches fly into the woods, and live there 
desperate; and so they should have them to hunt like ^ 
beasts, be afraid to stir out about their business, and have their 
plantations continually rifled, all their tame goats destroyed, and, 
in short, be reduced to a lite of continual distress. 

Atkins told them, however, they had better have to do with 
100 men than with 100 nations; that as they must destroy their 
boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed 
themselves. In a word, he shewed them the necessity of it so 
plainly, that they all came into it. So they went to work im- 
mediately with the boats, and, getting some dry wood together 
from a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire ; but 
they were so wet that they would not burn. However, the fire 
so burned the upper part that it soon made them unfit for swim- 
ming in the sea as boats. When the Indians saw what they 
were about, some of them came running out of the woods, and 
coming as near as they could to our men, kneeled down, and 
cried, " Oa, Oa, Waramokoa," and some other words of their 
lanofuage, which none of the others understood any thing of; hut 
as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, it was easy to 
imderstand they brcrged to have their boats spared, and that they 
would be gone, and never come there again. 

But our men were now satisfied that they had no way to pre- 
serve themselves, or to save thuir colony, but effectually to pre- 
vent any of these people from ever going home again; depend- 
ing upon this, that if even so much as one of them got back into 
their country to tell the story, the colony was undone. So that, 
letting them know that they should not have any mercy, they 
fell to work with their canoes, and destroyed them every one 
that the storm had not destroyed before : at the sight of which 
the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, which our people 
heard plain cnoue;li ; after which they ran about the island like 
distracted men ; so that, in a word, our men did not really know 
at first what to do with them. 

Nor did the Spaniards, with all their prudence, consider that, 
while they made those ])eoi)le thus desperate, they ought to have 
kept good guard at the same time upon their plantations ; for 
though it is true they had driven away their catde, and the In- 



CH. II. OF ROBINSON CBUSOE. 251 

dians did not find out their main retreat, I mean my old castle 
at the hill, nor the cave in the valley, yet they found out my 
plantation at the bower, and pulled it all to pieces, and all the 
fences and planting about it, trod all the corn under foot, tore 
up the vines and grapes, being just then almost ripe, and did to 
our men an inestimable damage, though to themselves not one 
farthing's worth of service. 

Though our people were able to fight them upon all occasions, 
yet they were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up 
and down ; for as they were too nimble of foot for our men when 
they found them single, so our men durst not go about single, 
for fear of being surrounded with their numbers. The best was, 
they had no weapons ; for though they had bows, they had no 
arrows left, nor any materials to make any, nor had they any 
edged tool or weapon among them. 

The extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, 
and indeed deplorable ; but at the same time our men were also 
brought to very bad circumstances by them ; for though their 
retreats were preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and 
their harvest spoiled ; and what to do, or which way to turn 
tiiemselves, they knew not. The only refuge they had now was 
the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave, and some 
little corn which grew there, and the plantation of the three 
Englishmen, Will Atkins and his comrades, who were now re- 
duced to two, one of them being killed by an arrow, which struck 
him on the side of his head, just under the temples, so that he 
never spoke more : and it was very remarkable that this was the 
same barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage slave with his 
hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have murdered all the 
Spaniards. 

I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than 
mine was at any time after I first discovered the grains of barley 
and rice, and got into the manner of planting and raising my 
corn, and my tame cattle ; for now they had, as I may say, a 
hundred wolves upon the island, which would devour every 
thing they could ^ome at, yet could very hardly be come at 
themselves. 

Tlie first thing they concluded, when they saw what their cir- 
cumstances were, was, that they would, if possible, drive them 
up to the farther part of the island, south-west, that if any more 
savages came on shore, they might not find one another; then, 
that they would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as many of 
them as they could come at, till they had reduced their number ; 
and if they could at last tame them, and bring them to any thing, 
they would give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and 
live upon their daily labour. 

In order to this, they so followed them, and so terrified them 
with their guns^ that in a few days, if any of them fired a gun at 



252 LIFE AND ADYBNTUBES FT. II. 

an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall down for ietr; 
and 80 dreadfully frightened they were, that they kept out of 
sight, farther and farther, till at last our men, foJlowiug them, 
and every day almost killing or wounding some of them, thej 
kept up in the woods and hollow places so much, that it reduced 
them to the utmost misery for want of food ; and nmny were 
afterwards found dead in the woods, without any hurt, but merely 
starved to death. 

When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and 
pity moved them ; especially the Spaniard governor ; and he 
proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive, and bring him to 
understand what they meant, so far as to be able to act as inter- 
preter, and to go among them, and see if they might be brought 
to some conditions, that might be depended upon, to save their 
lives, and to do their masters no injury. 

It was some while before any of them could be taken ; but 
being weak and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised, 
and made a prisoner. He was sullen at first, and would neither 
eat nor drink ; but finding himself kindly used, and victuals 
given him, and no violence offered him, he at last grew tractable, 
and came to himself. 

They brought old Friday to him, who talked often with him, 
and told him how kind the others would be to them all ; that they 
would not only save their lives, but would give them a part of 
the island to live in, provided they would give satisfaction that 
they would keep in their own bounds, and not come beyond them 
to injure or prejudice others ; and that they should have com 
given them to plant and make it grow for their bread, and some 
bread given them for their present subsistence. And old Friday 
bade the fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen, ana 
see what they said to it ; assurin? them, that if they did not agree 
immediately, they should be all destroyed. 

The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in num- 
ber to about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first 
offer, and begged to have some food given them. Upon which 
twelve Spaniards and two Englishmen, wcUtarmed, with three 
Indian slaves and old Friday, marched to the place where they 
were. The three Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of 
bread, some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and 
three live goats ; and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, 
where they sat down, eat the provisions very thankfully, and 
were the most faithful fellows to their word that could be thought 
of; for, except when they came to beg victuals and directions, 
they never came out of their bounds : and there they lived when 
I came to the island, and 1 went to see them. 

They had been taught both to plant care, make bread, breed 
tame jroats, and milk them. They were confined to a ueck of 
laud, surrounded with high rocks behind theui, and lying plain

towards the sea before them, on the south-east comer of the 
island. They had land enough, and it was very good and fruit- 
ful ; about a mile and a half broad^ and three or four miles in 
length. 

Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such as I made 
for myself, and gave them twelve hatchets and three or four 
knives ; and there they lived the most subjected innocent crea- 
tures that ever were heard of. 

The colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect to 
the savages till I came to revisit them, which was above two 
years after ; not but that now and then some canoes of savages 
came on shore for their triumphal unnatural feasts. But as they 
were of several nations, and, perhaps, had never heard of those 
that came before, or the reason of it, they did not make any 
search or inquiry after their countrymen ; and if they had^ it 
would have been very hard to have found them out.

as also chairs to eit on, stools, beds, couches, and abuudwice 
of other thini^s. 

My coming was a particular relief to these people, bet»nse we 
furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, skovels, pick-aies, 
and all things of that kind which they could want. 

With the help of these tools they were so very handy, that 
they came at last to build up their huts, or houses, very hand- 
somely, raddling or working like baaket-work all the way round, 
which was a very eitraordinary piece of ingenuity, and looked 
very odd, but was an exceeding good fence, as well against heat 
as ugaia^t all sorts of vermin : and our men were so taken 
with it, that they got the savages to come and do the like for 
them. So that when I came to see the two EnglisLmen's coloDies, 



CH. III. ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 255 

they looked, at a distance, as if they lived all like bees in a hive ; 
and as for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious 
and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket-work 
as, I believe, was never seen. It was 120 paces round in the out- 
side ; the walls were as close worked as a basket, in pannels or 
squares thirty-two in number, very strong, and standing about 
seven feet high. In the middle was another, not above twenty- 
two paces round, but built stronger, being eight-sided in its 
form: and in the ei^ht corners^ stood eight very strong posts, 
round the top of which he laid 'strong pieces, pinned together 
with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for a roof of 
eight rafters, very handsome, and joined togetlier very welJ, though 
he had no nails, and onlv a few iron spikes, which ne made him- 
self, too, out of the old iron that I had left there. Indeed^ this 
fellow shewed abundance of ingenuity in several things which 
he had no knowledge of. He made him a forge, with a pair of 
wooden bellows to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for 
his work ; and he formed out of one of the iron crows a middling 
good anvil to hammer upon. In this manner he made many 
things, but especially hooks, staples and spikes, bolts and hinges. 
But to return to the house. After he had pitched the roof of his 
innermost tent, he worked it up between the rafters with basket- 
work so firm, and thatched that over again so ingeniously with 
rice straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, which covered the 
top, that his house was as dry as if it had been tiled or slated. 
He owned, however, that the savages made the basket-work for 
him. 

Tlie outer circuit was covered, as a lean-to, all round this 
inner apartment, and long rafters lay from the two and thirty 
angles to the top posts of the inner house, being about twenty 
feet distant ; so that there was a space like a walk within the 
outer wicker- waD, and without the inner, near twenty feet wide. 

The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, 
but much fairer, and divided it into six apartments, so that he 
had six rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there was 
a door ; first, into the entry or coming into the main tent, and 
another door into the space or walk mat was round it ; so that 
walk was also divided into six equal parts, which served not only 
for retreat, but to store up any necessaries which the family had 
occasion for. These six spaces not taking up the whole circum- 
ference, what other apartments the outer circle had were thus 
arranged. As soon as you were in at the door of the outer circle, 
you had a short passage straight before you to the door of the 
inner house ; but on either side was a wicker partition, and a 
door in it, by which you went, first, into a large room or store- 
house, twenty feet wide and about thirty feet long, and through 
that into another not quite so long. So that in tne outer circle 
were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at 



256 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

through the apartments of the inner tent, and served as closets or 
retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle; and 
four large warehouses or bams, which went in through one ano- 
ther, two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer 
door to the inner tent. 

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the 
world ; nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so 
built. In this great bee-hive lived the three families ; that is to 
say. Will Atkins and his companion. The third 'was killed, but 
his wife remained with three children ; and the other two were 
not at all backward to give the widow her full share of every 
thing ; I mean as to their corn, milk, gra])es, &c., and iivhen thev 
killed a kid, or found a turtle on the shore. So that they all 
lived well enough, though it was true they were not so industrioos 
as the other two, as has been observed already. 

One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as for reli- 
gion. I donH know that there was any thing of that kind among 
them ; they pretty often, indeed, put one another in mind, that 
there was a God, by the very common method of seamen, vii. 
swearing by His Name ; nor were their poor, ignorant savage 
wives much the better for having been married to Christians, as 
we must call them ; for as they knew very little of God them- 
selves, so they were utterly incapable of entering into any dis- 
course with their wives about a God, or of talking any thing to 
them concerning religion. 

The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives 
had made from them was, that they had taught them to speak 
English very well ; and all the children they had, which was 
near twenty in all, were taught to speak English too, from their 
first learning to speak ; though they at first spoke it in a very 
broken manner, like their mothers. There were none of these 
children above six years old when I came thither ; for it was not 
much above seven years that they had fetched these five savi^ 
ladies over ; but they had all had children, more or less. The 
mothers were all a good sort of well-governed, quiet, laborious 
women, modest and decent, helpful to one another, mighty ob- 
servant and subject to their masters, — I cannot call them hus- 
bands ; and wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the 
Christian religion, and to be legally married ; both which were 
happily brought about afterwards by my means, or, at least, in 
consequence of my coming among them. 

Having thus given an account of the colony in general, and 
of my five runagate Englishmen, I must say something of the 
Spaniards, who were the main body of the family ; and in whose 
story there are some incidents also remarkable enough. 

I had a great many discourses with them about their cir- 
cumstances when they were among the savages. They told me 
readily, that they had no instances to give of their application 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 257 

or ingenuity in that country ; that they were a poor, miserable, 
dejected handful of people ; that if means had been put into 
their hands, they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair, 
and so sunk under the weight of their misfortunes, that they 
thought of nothing but starving. One of them, a grave and 
very sensible man, told rae, he was convinced they were in the 
wrong ; that it was not the part of wise men to give up them- 
selves to their misery, but always to take hold of the helps which 
reason offered, as well for present support as for future deliver- 
ance. 

He ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvements 
I had made in my solitude, my unwearied application, as he 
called it, and how I had made a condition which in its circum- 
stances was at first much worse than theirs, a thousand times 
more happy than theirs was even now, when they were all 
together. 

I told him, their case and mine differed exceedingly ; that 
they were cast upon the shore without necessaries, without sup- 
ply of food, or 01 present sustenance, till they could provide it : 
that it is true, I had this disadvantage and discomfort, that I was 
alone ; but then the supplies which were providentially thrown 
into my hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore, 
were such a help as would have encouraged any creature in the 
world to have applied himself as I had done. " Signor,'' said 
the Spaniard, " had we been in your case, we should never have 
got half those things out of the ship that you did ; nay, we 
should never have found means to have gotten a raft to carry 
them, or to have gotten the raft on shore without boat or sail ; 
and how much less should we have done, • if any of us had been 
alone?" I desired him to abate his compliment, and go on 
with the history of their coming on shore where they landed. 
He told me, they unhappily landed at a place where there were 
people without provisions ; whereas, had they had the common 
sense to have put off to sea again, and gone to another island a 
little farther, they had found provisions, though without people. 
As it was, they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs, 
which they understood not, and which had no substance in them, 
and which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough, and who 
could treat them no better, unless they would turn cannibals, and 
eat men's flesh, which was the great dainty of their country. 

They gave me an account how many ways they strove to 
civilise the savages they were with, and to teach them rational 
customs in the ordinary way of living ; but in vain ; and how 
they retorted it upon them as unjust, that they who came there 
for assistance and support, should attempt to set up for instruc- 
tors of those that gave them bread ; intimating, it seems, that 
none should set up for the instructors of others, but those who 
could live without them. 

z2 



25 S LIFE AND ADVENTURES .>T. It 

They gave me dismal accounts of the extremides they were 
driven to ; how, sometimes, they were many days without anj 
food at all ; the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort 
of savages that lived more indolently, and, for that reason, were 
less supplied with the necessaries of life, than they had reason to 
believe others were in the same part of the world ; and yet they 
found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious than 
those who had better supplies of food. 

Also they added, that they could not but see with what de- 
monstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence 
of God directs the events of things in the world ; which, they 
said, appeared in their circumstances; for if, pressed by the 
hardships they were under, and the barrenness of the coontry 
where they were, they had searched after a better place to li?e 
in, they had then been out of the way of the relief that happened 
to them by my means. 

They then gave me an account, how the savap^es they lived 
among expected them to go out with them to their wars ; and, 
it was true, that, as they had fire-arms with them, had they not 
had the disaster to lose their ammunition^ they should not have 
been serviceable only to their friends, but have made themselves 
terrible both to friends and enemies ; but being without powder 
and shot, and yet in a condition that they could not in reason 
refuse to go out with their landlords to their wars, so when they 
came into the field of battle, they were in a worse condition than 
the savages themselves ; for they neither had bows or arrows, 
nor could they u^e those the savages gave them ; so that they 
could do nothing but stand still, and be wounded with arrows, 
till they came up to the teeth of their enemy. Then, indeed, the 
three halberts they had were of use to them ; and they would 
often drive a whole little army before them with those halberts 
and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets ; bat 
that, for all this, they were sometimes surrounded with multi- 
tudes, and in great danger from their arrows ; till, at last, they 
found the way to make themselves large targets of wood, which 
they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew 
not ; and these protected them from the arrows of the savages; 
that, notwithjitanding these, they were sometimes in great dan- 
ger, and were once Hve of them knocked down together by 
the clubs of the savages, which was the time when one of them 
was taken prisoner ; namely, the Spaniard whom I had relieved. 
That at first they thought he had been killed ; but when after- 
wards they heard he was taken prisoner, they were under the 
greatest grief imaginable, and would willingly have all ventured 
their lives to have rescued him. 

They told me, that when they were so knocked down, the 
rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them fight- 
ing, till $hey were come to themselves^ all but him whom they 



0£[« III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 259 

thought had been dead ; and then they made their way with 
their halberts and pieces^ standing close together in a line, 
through a body of above a thousand savages, and beating down 
ell that came m their way, got the victory over their enemies ; 
but to their great sorrow, because it was with the loss of their 
friend ; whom the other party, finding him alive, carried oflP with 
some others, — as I gave an account in my former part. 

They described most affectionatelv, now they were surprised 
with joy at the return of their frienrf and companion in misery, 
who, tney thought, had been devoured by wild beasts of the 
worst kind, viz. by wild men ; and yet, now more and more 
they were surprised with the account he gave them of his errand, 
and that there was a Christian in any place near, much more 
one that was able and had humanity enough to contribute to 
their deliverance. 

They described how they were astonished at the sight of the 
relief I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread, 
things they had not seen since their coming to that miserable 
place ; how often they crossed it and blessed it, as bread sent 
from Heaven ; and what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits 
to taste it ; as also of the other things I had sent for their 
supply. 

And, after all, they would have told me something of the 
joy they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them 
away to the person and place from whence all these new com- 
forts came ; but they told me, it was impossible to express it 
by words ; for their excessive joy, naturally driving them to un- 
becoming extravagances, they had no wav to describe them, but 
by telling me, that they bordered upon lunacy, having no way 
to give vent to their passion suitable to the sense that was upon 
them ; that in some it worked one way, and in some another ; 
and that some of them, through a surprise of joy, would burst 
out into tears ; others would be stark mad, and others imme- 
diately faint. This discourse extremely affected me, and called 
to my mind Friday's ecstacy when he met his father, and the 
poor people's ecstacy when I took them up at sea, after their 
ship was on fire ; the mate of the ship's joy, when he found him- 
self delivered from a place where he expected to perish ; and 
my own joy when, after twenty-eight years' captivity, I found a 
good ship ready to carry me to my own country. 

All tnese things made roe more sensible of the relation of 
those poor men, and more affected with it. 

Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found 
them, I must relate the heads of what I did for these people, and 
the condition in which I left them. It was their opinion, and 
mine too, that they would be troubled no more with the savages ; 
or that if they were, they would be able to cut them off, if they 
were twice as many as before ; so they had no concern about 



260 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. 11. 

that. Then I entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniaid 
\irhom I called governor, about their stay in the island ; for as I 
was not come to carry all of them off, so it would not be just 
to carry off some, and leave others, who perhaps would be un- 
willing to stay if their strength was diminished. 

On the other hand, I told them, I came to establish them 
there, not to remove them ; and then I let them know, that I 
had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them. That I 
bad been at a great charge to supply them with all things neces- 
sary as well for their convenience as their defence ; and that I 
had such and such particular persons with me, as well to in- 
crease and recruit their number, as by the particular necessary 
employments which they were bred to, being artificers, to assist 
them m those things in which, at present, they were to seek. 

They were all together when I talked thus to them ; and he- 
fore I delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, 
one by one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the first ani- 
mosities that had been among them, and would shake hands 
with one another, and engage in a strict friendship and union 
of interests, that so there might be no more misunderstandings or 
jealousies. 

Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humour, 
said, " They had met with afflictions enough to make them all 
sober, and enemies enough to make them all friends. That, for 
his part, he would live and die with them ; and was so far from 
designing any thing against the Spaniards, that he owned they 
had done nothing to him but what his own mad humour made 
necessary, and what he would have done, and perhaps much 
worse, in their case ; and that he would ask them pardon, if 
I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had done to 
them; and was very willing and desirous of living on terms of 
entire friendship and union with them ; and would do any tiling 
that lay in his power to convince them of it : and as for going 
to England, he cared not if he did not go thither for twenty 
years." 

The Spaniards said, they had indeed, at first, disarmed and 
excluded Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill-con- 
duct, as they had let me know. And they appealed to me, for 
the necessity they were under to do so ; but that Will Atkins 
had behavea himself so bravely in the great fight they had with 
the savages, and on several occasions since, and had shewed 
himself so faithful to, and concerned for, the general interest of 
them all, that they had forgotten all that was past, and thought 
he merited as much to be trusted with arms, and supplied with 
necessaries, as any of them ; and that they bad testified their 
satisfaction in him, hy committing the command to him, next to 
the governor himself ; and as they had an entire confidence in 
him and all his countrymen^ so they acknowledged^ they had 



CH. III. OF ROBIKSON CRUSOE. 261 

merited that confidence, by all the methods that honest men 
could merit, to be valued and trusted : and they most heartily 
embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they 
would never have any interest separate from one another. 

Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we 
appointed the next day to dine all together; and, indeed; we 
made a splendid feast. I caused the ship's cook and his mate 
to come on shore, and dress our dinner ; and the old cook's 
mate we had on shore assisted. We brought on shore six pieces 
of good beef, and four pieces of pork, out of the ship's provi- 
sion, with our punch-bowl, and materials to fill it ; and, in par- 
ticular, I gave them ten bottles of French claret, and ten bottles 
of English beer, — things that neither the Spaniards nor the 
Englishmen had tasted for many years, and which, it may be 
supposed, they were exceedingly glad of. 

The Spaniards added to our feast five whole kids, which the 
cooks roasted ; and three of them were sent, covered up close, 
on board the ship to the seamen, that they might feast on fresh 
meat from on shore, as we did with their salt meat from on 
board. 

After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I 
brought out my cargo of goods, wherein, that there might be no 
dispute about dividmg, I shewed them that there was sufficient 
for them all ; desired that they might all take an equal quantity 
of the goods that were for wearing ; that is to say, equal when 
made up. As, first, I distributed linen sufficient to make every 
one of them six shirts ; these were exceedingly comfortable to 
them, being what, as I may say, they had long since forgot the 
use of, or what it wa«* to wear them. 

I allotted the thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, 
to make every one a light coat, like a frock, which I judged 
fittest for the heat of the season, cool and loose; and ordered^ 
that whenever thejr decayed, they should make more, as they 
thought fit. The like for pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &c. 

I cannot express what pleasure sat upon the countenances of 
all these poor men, when they saw the care I had taken of them 
and how well I had furnished them. They told me, I was a 
father to them ; and that, having such a correspondent as I 
was, in so remote a part of the world, it would make them for- 
get that they were left in a desolate place ; and they all volun- 
tarily engaged not to leave the place without my consent. 

Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me ; 
particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of 
them most necessary persons ; but above all, my general arti- 
ficer, than whom they could not name any thing that was more 
useful to them. And the tailor, to shew his concern for them, 
went to work immediately, and, with my leave, made them 
every one a shirt the first tlung }ie did ; and^ what was still 



262 LIFE AND ADTBNTURBS FT. U. 

more, he taught the women not only how to sew and stitch and 
use the needle, but made them assist to make the shirts for their 
husbands, and for all the rest. 

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they 
were ; for they took in pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, 
and made them clever, convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cap- 
boards, lockers, shelves, and every thing they wanted of that 
kind. 

Then I brought them out all my store of tools^ and gave 
every man a digging spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had 
no harrows or ploughs ; and, to every separate place, a pick* 
axe, a crow, a broad-axe, and a saw ; always appointing, that 
as often as any was broken, or worn*out, they should be sup- 
plied, without grudging, out of the general stores that I left 
behind. 

All sorts of tools and iron-work they had without tale, as 
they required ; for no man would care to take more than he 
wanted ; and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil them, 
on any account whatever. And for the use of the smith I left 
two tons of unwrought iron for a supply. 

My magazine of powder and arms, which I brought them, 
was such, even to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at 
them ; for now they could march as I used to do, with a musket 
upon each shoulder, if there was occasion ; and were able to 
fight one thousand savages, if they had but some little advan- 
tage of situation; which also they could not miss of, if they had 
occasion. 

I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was 
starved to death, and the maid also ; she was a sober, well-edu- 
cated, religious young woman, and behaved so inofFensively that 
every one gave her a good word. She had, indeed, an unhappy 
life with us, there being no woman in the ship but herself ; but 
she bore it with patience. After a while, seeing things so well 
ordered, and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island, and 
considering that they had neither business nor acquaintance in 
the East Indies, nor reason for taking so long a voyage, both of 
them came to me, and desired I would give them leave to re- 
main on the island, and be entered among my famil}'^, as they 
called it. 

I agreed to it readily ; and they had a little plat of ground 
allotted to them, where they had three tents or nouses set up, 
surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed like Atkins's, adjoin- 
ing to his plantation. Their tents were contrived so, that they 
had each of them a room, a part to lodge in, and a middle tent, 
like a great store-house, to lay all their goods in, and to eat and 
drink in. And now the other two Englishmen removed their 
habitation to the same place ; and so the island was divided into 
three colonies, and no more i viz. first, the one just named^ next 



CH. Ill* OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 263 

that of the Spaniards, with old Friday, and the first servants, 
at my old habitation under the hill, which was, in a word, the 
capital city, and where they had so enlarged and extended their 
works, as well under as on the outside of the hill, that they lived, 
though perfectly concealed, yet full at large. 

The other colony was that of Atkins, where there were four 
families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their 
wives and children ; three savages that were slaves, the widow 
and children of the Englishman that was killed, the young man, 
and the maid -servant. There were also the two carpenters, and 
the tailor, whom I brought with me for them ; also the smith, 
who was a very necessary man to them, especially as a gunsmith, 
to take care of their arms ; and my other man, whom I called 
Jack-of-all-trades ; who was in himself as good almost as twenty 
men, for he was not only a very ingenious but a very merry 
fellow ; and, before I went away, we married him to the honest 
maid that came with the youth in the ship. 

And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say 
something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me 
out of the ship's crew. 

He was a grave, sober, pious, and most religious person ; 
exact in life, extensive in bis charity, and exemplary in almost 
every thing he did. 

The first hour that I began to converse with him,.after he had 
agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight 
exceedingly in his conversation. And he first began with me about 
religion, in the most obliging manner imaginable. 

** Sir," says he, " you have not only, under God (and at that 
he crossed his breast) saved my life, but you have admitted me to 
go this voyage in your ship, and by your obliging civility have 
taken me into your family, giving me an opportunity of frbe con- 
versation. Now, sir, you see by my habit what my profession 
is ; and I guess, by your nation, what 3'ours is : I may think it 
is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my utmost endeavours, 
on all occasions, to bring all the souls I can to the knowledge of 
the truth, and to embrace the Catholic faith ; but, as I am here 
under your permission, and in your family, I am bound, in 
justice to your kindness, as well as in decency and sood man- 
ners, to be under your government ; and therefore 1 shall not, 
without your leave, enter into any debates on the point of re- 
ligion, in which we may not agree, farther than you shall give 
me leave." 

He added, that he thought all our conversation might be 
easily separated from disputes ; that it was not his business to 
cap principles with every man he discoursed with ; that if I 
would give him leave, at any time, to discourse upon religious 
subjects, he would readily comply with it ; and that he did not 
doubt but I would allow him then also to defend his own opinions 



I 



264 LIFE AND ADVENTURB8 FT. H. 

as well as he could : but that, without my leave, he would not 
break in upon me with any such thing. 

He told me farther, that he would not cease to do all that 
became him in his office as a priest, as well as a private Chris- 
tian, to procure the good of the ship, and the sarety of all that 
was in her ; and though, perhaps, we would not join with him, 
and he could not pray with us, he hoped he might pray for as, 
which he would do upon all occasions. In this manner we con- 
yersed ; and as he was of a most obliging gentlemanlike beha- 
viour, so he was, if I may be allowed to say so, a man of good 
sense, and, as I believe, of great learning. 

He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the 
many extraordinary events of it ; of many adventures which had 
betaUen him in the few years tiiat he had been abroad in the 
world ; but I shall not make digressions into other men's stories, 
which have no relation to my own. I return to what concems 
our affair in the island.' He came to me one mornin?, just when 
I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at the farthest part 
of the island, and said, with a very grave countenance, that he 
had, for two or three days, desired an opportunity of some dis- 
course with me, which, he hoped, would not be displeasing to 
me, because he thought it might, in some measure, correspond 
with my general design, which was the prosperity of my new 
colony ; and, perhaps, might put it, at least more than he yet 
thought it was, in the way of God's blessing. 

I looked a little surprised at the last part of his discourse, 
and turning a little short, " How, sir," said I, " can it be said, 
that we are not in the way of God's blessing, after such visible 
assistances and wonderful deliverances as we have seen here, and 
of which I have given you a large account?" 

^' If you had pleased, sir," said he, with a world of modesty 
and yet with great readiness, ^* to have heard me, you wouli 
have found no room to have been displeased, much less to think 
so hard of me, that I should suggest that you have not had won- 
derful assistances and deliverances. And I hope, on your behalf, 
that you are in the way of God's blessing, and your design is 
exceeding good and will prosper. But, sir, thousn it were more 
so than is even possible to you, yet there may be some among 
you that are not equally right in their actions. And you know, 
that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan, in the 
camp, removed God's blessing from them, and turned His hand 
so against them, that six and thirty of them, though not con- 
cerned in the crime, were the object of divine vengeance, and 
bore the weight of that punishment." 

I was sensibly touched with his discourse ; and told him his 
inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, 
and was really so religious in its own nature, that I was very 
sorry I had interrupted him ] and begged him to go on. Andf,

in the mean time, because it seemed that what we had both to 
say might take up some time, I told him I was going to the 
Englishmen's plantations, and asked him to go with me, and we 
might discourse of it by the way. He told me, he would more 
willingly wait on me thither, because there, partly, the thing 
w^as acted, which he desired to speak to me about. So we 
walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with me in 
what he had to say. 

" Why, then, sir,'* says he, " be pleased to give me leave to 
lay down a few propositions, as the foundation of what I have to 
say, that we may not differ in the general principles, though we 
may be of some differing opinions in the practice of particulars. 
First, sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of 
religion, — and it is very unhappy that it is so, — yet there are 
general principles in which we both agree ; namely, firsts that 
there is a God, and that this God, having given us some stated 
general rules for our service and obedience, we ought not wil- 
lingljr and knowingly to offend Him, either by neglecting to do 
what' He has commanded, or by doing what He has expressly 
forbidden. And let our different religions be what they will, 
this general principle is readily owned by us all : that the bless- 
ing of God does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous sinning 
against His command ; and every good Christian will be affec- 
tionately concerned to prevent any that are under his care living 
in a total neglect of God and His commands.'' 

I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I 
granted all he had said ; and thanked him that he should so far 
concern himself for us, and begged he would explain the par- 
ticulars of what he had observed, that, like Joshua (to take his 
own parable) I might put away the accursed thing from us. 

"Why, then, sir," says he, "I will take the liberty you 
give me; and there are three things, which, if I am right, 
must stand in the way of God's blessing upon your endeavours 
here, and which I should rejoice, for your sake, and their own, 
to see removed. And, sir, I promise myself that you will 
fully agree with me in them all, as soon as I name them ; es- 
pecially because I shall convince you, that every one of them 
may, with great ease, and very much to your satisfaction, be re- 
medied." 

He gave me no time to put in any more civilities, but went 
on. "First, sir," says he, "you have here four Englishmen, 
who have fetched women from among the savages, and have 
thken them as their wives, and have had many children, and yet 
are not married to them, as the laws of God and man require. 
To this, sir, I know you will object, that there was no clergy- 
man, or priest of any kind or of any profession, to perform the 
ceremony ; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a con- 
tract of marriage, and have it signed between them. And I

know also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has told yon; I 
mean of the agreement that he obliged them to make when 
they took these women. 

"But, sir, the essence of matrimony consists not only in the 
mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man and 
wife, but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in the 
contract to compbl the man and woman, at all times, to own 
and acknowledge each other, and to provide for their children. 
Now, sir," he continued, " these men may, when they please, 
or when occasion presents, abandon these women, disown their 
children, leave them to perish, and take other women and marry 
them whilst these are living." And here he added , with some 
warmth, "How, sir, is God honoured in this unlawful liberty? 
And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours in this place, 
when it is certainly in your power to put an end to it V 

I confess I was struck at the thing itself, but much more with 
the convincing arguments he supported it with. I granted all 
that he had said to be just, and, on his part, very kind ; that I 
would discourse with the men upon the point now, when I came 
to them. And I knew no reason why they should scruple to let 
him marry them all ; which I knew well enough would be g^nted 
to be authentic and valid in England. 

I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint 
which he had to make; acknowledging that I was very much 
his debtor for the first; and thanked him heartily for it. He 
told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the 
second ; and hoped I would take it as well : and this was, that 
notwithstanding these English subjects of mine, as he called 
them, had lived with those women for almost seven years, had 
taught them to speak English, and even to read it ; and that 
they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable understanding, 
and capable of instruction ; yet they had not to this hour taught 
them any thing of the Christian religion, no, not so much as to 
know that there was a God or a worship, or in what manner 
God was to be served ; or that their own idolatry, and worship- 
ping they knew not whom, was false and absurd. 

This, he said, was an unaccountable neglect, and what God 
would certainly call them to account for ; and, perhaps, at last 
take the work out of their hands. He spoke this very affec- 
tionately and warmly. " I am persuaded," said he, " had those 
men lived in the savage country whence their wives came, the 
savages would have taken more pains to have brought them to 
be idolaters, and to worship the devil, than any of these men 
have taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the true 
God. Now, sir, though we may differ on some things, yet 
surely we should be glad to see the deviPs servants, and the 
subjects of his kingdom, taught to know the great principles of 
the Christian religion ; that they m>ght hear of God, and of a 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 267 

Hedeemeb, and of the Resurrection, and of a future state, — 
things which we all believe." 

I could hold no longer ; I took him in my arms, and embraced 
him with an excess of passion. " How far," said I to him, " havo 
I been from understanding the most essential part of a Chris- 
tian, namely, to love the interest of the Christian faith, and the 
good of other men's souls ! I scarce have known what belongs 
to being a Christian." *^ Oh, sir, do not say so," replied he : 
^' this thing is not your fault." *' No," said I, " but why did I 
never lay it to heart as well as you ?" ** 'Tis not too late yet,'' 
said he ; *^ be not too forward to condemn yourself." " But 
what can be done now?" said I ; *'you see I am going away." 
** Will you give me leave," said he, *' to talk with these poor 
men about it?" "Yes, with all my heart," said I ; "and will 
oblige them to give heed to what you say too." "As to that," 
said he, " we must leave them to the mercy of Christ : but 'tis 
our business to assist them, encourage them, and instruct them ; 
and if you will give me leave, and God His blessing, I do not 
doubt but the poor ignorant souls may be instructed ; and that 
even while you stay here." Upon this, I said, " I shall not only 
give you leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it." 

I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to 
blame. " Why, really," says he, " 'tis of the same nature, and I 
will proceed with the same plainness as before. It is about your 
poor savages, who are (as I may say) your conquered subjects. 
It is a maxim, sir^ that is, or ought to be, received among all 
Christians, that the Christian knowledge ought to be propagated 
by all possible means, and on all possible occasions. It is on 
this principle that the church sends missionaries into Persia, 
India, and China; and that our clergy, even of the superior 
sort, willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages, and the 
most dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians, to 
teach them the knowledge of the true God, and to bring them 
over to embrace the Christian faith. Now, sir, you have such 
an opportunity here, to have six or seven-and-thirty poor savages 
brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of God, their Maker 
and Redeemer, that I wonder how you can pass such an occa- 
sion of doing good ; which is really worth the expense of a man's 
whole life." 

I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say. 
I had here a spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion 
before me ; but as for me, I had not so much as entertained a 
thought of this in my heart before, and, I believe, should not 
have thought of it ; for I looked upon these savages as slaves, 
and people who, had we any work for them to do, we would have 
used as such, or would have been glad to have transported them 
to any other part of the world ; for our business was to get rid of 
them, and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent 



268 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. U. 

to any country, so they had never seen their own. I say, I was 
confounded at his discourse, and knew not what answer to make 
him. He looked earnestly at me, seeing me in some disorder. 
" Sir," said he, " I shall be very sorry if what I have said gives 
you any offence." " No, no,'* said I, " I am offended with no- 
body but myself; but I am perfectly confounded, not only to 
think that I should never take any notice of this before, but with 
reflecting what notice I am able to take of it now. You know, 
sir, what circumstances I am in. I am bound to the East In- 
dies, in a ship freighted by merchants, and to whom it would 
be an insufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the 
men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon tne owners' 
account. It is true I agreed to be allowed twelve days here ; and 
if I stav more, I must pay three pounds sterling per diem demor- 
rage. Not can I stay upon demurrage above eight days more^ 
and I have been here thirteen days already ; so that I am per- 
fectly unable to engage in this work, unless I would suffer my- 
self to be left behind here again. In which case, if this single 
ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage, I should be jost 
in the same condition that I was left in here at first, and from 
which I have been so wonderfully delivered." 

He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage; 
but laid it home upon my conscience, whether the blessing of 
saving seven and thirty souls was not worth my venturing all I 
had in the world for? I was not so sensible of that as he was, and 
I returned upon him thus : " Why, sir, it is a valuable thin^ 
indeed to be an instrument in God's hand to convert seven and 
thirty heathens to the knowledge of Christ : but as you are an 
ecclesiastic, and are given over to the work, so that it seems natu- 
rally to fall into the way of your profession, how is it that you do 
not rather offer yourself to undertake it than press me to it?'' 

Upon this he faced about, just before me, as we walked along, 
and putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow. "1 
most heartily thank God and you, sir," said he, *' for giving me 
so evident a call to so blessed a work ; and if you think yourself 
discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will most 
readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and 
difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met 
with, that I may be dropped at last into so glorious a work.'' 

I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this 
to me ; his eyes sparkled like fire, his face glowed, and his colour 
came and went, as if be had been falling into fits. I paused a 
considerable while before I could tell what to say to him ; for I 
was really surprised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal, and 
carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men, not of his 
profession only, but even of any profession whatsoever. But, 
after a while, I asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and 
would venture^ on the single consideration of an attempt on 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 269 

those poor people, to be locked up in an implanted island for, 
perhaps, his life ; and, at last, might not know whether he should 
be able to do them any good or not? 

He turned short upon me, and asked me what I called a ven- 
ture ? " Pray, sir," said he, *' what do you think I consented to 
fo in your ship to the East Indies for?" " Nay," said I, " that 
know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians." " Doubtless 
it was," said he. "And do you think, if I can convert these 
seven and thirty men to the faith of Christ, it is not worth my 
time, though I should never be fetched oif the island again ? Nay, 
is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls than my 
life is, or the life of twenty more of the same profession ? But 
since you will honour me," continued he, " with putting me into 
this work (for which I will pray for you all the days of my life), I 
have one humble petition to you besides." " What is that ?" 
said I. " Why," said he, " it is, that you will leave your man 
Friday with me to be my interpreter to them, and to assist me ; 
for, without some help, I cannot speak to them or they to me." 

I was sensibly troubled at his requesting Friday, because I 
could not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons. 
He had been the companion of my travels ; he was not only faith- 
ful to me, but sincerely affectionate to the last decree ; and I had 
resolved to do somethmg considerable for him if he outlived me, 
as it was probable he would. 

However, a sudden thought relieved me in this strait, and it 
•was this : I told him I could not say that I was willing to part 
■with Friday on any account whatever, though a work that to him 
was of more value than his life ought to be to me of much more 
value than the keeping or parting with a servant. But, on the 
other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by no means con- 
sent to part with me, and I could not force him to it without his 
consent, without manifest injustice, because I had promised I 
-would never put him away ; and he had promised and engaged 
to me that he would never leave me, unless I put him away. 

He seemed very much concerned at it ; for he had no means 
of instructing these poor people, seeing he did not understand 
one word of their language, nor they one word of his. To re- 
move this diiBculty, 1 told him Friday's father had learned 
Spanish, which I found he also understood ; and he should serve 
Lim for an interpreter. 

I come back now to the first part of his objections. When we 
came to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together ; and after 
some account given them of what I had done for them, namely, 
what necessary things I had provided for them, and how they 
were distributed, which they were very thankful for, — I began to 
talk to them of the life they led, and gave them a full account of 
the notice the clergyman had already taken of it. 

They all gave me the answer that I expected, namely, that 

A a2 



270 LIFE AND ADVENTUBBB FT. H. 

there was nobody to marry them ; that they agreed before the 
governor to keep these women as their wives ; and they thoosbt, 
as things stood with them, they were as legally marriedf as ifuey 
had been married by a parson^ and with cdl the formalities in the 
world. 

I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of 
GoD^ and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives; 
but that the laws of men being otherwise, they might pretend 
they were not married, and so desert the poor women and childreD 
hereafter. I therefore told them, that unless I was assured of 
their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take 
care that what I did should be for the women and their children 
without them ; and that unless they would give some assurances 
that they would marry the women, I could not think it was fitting 
that they should continue together as man and wife ; for that it 
was both scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they 
could not think would bless them if they went on thus. 

All this went on as I expected ; and they told me, especially 
Will Atkins, who seemed now to speak for the rest, that they 
loved their wives as well as if they had been bom in their own 
native country, and would not leave them upon any account 
whatever ; and they did verily believe their wives were as virtu- 
ous and as modest, and did, to the utmost of their skill, as much 
for them and for their children as any women could possibly do; 
and they would not part with them on any account. And Will 
Atkins, for his own particular, added, if any man would take him 
away, and offer to carry him home to England, and make him 
captain of the best man-of-war in the navy, he would not go with 
him if he might not carry his wife and children with him ; and if 
there was a clergyman in the ship, he would be married to her 
now with all his heart. 

This was just as I would have it ; the priest was not with me 
at that moment, but was not far off. So, to try him farther, I 
told him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere, I 
would have him married the next morning; and bade him consider 
of it, and talk with the rest. He said, as for himself, he need 
not consider of it at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was 
glad I had a minister with me ; and he believed they would be 
all willing also. I then told him that my friend the minister was 
a Frenchman, and could not speak English ; but that I would act 
the clerk between them. So we parted. I went back to my 
clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his companion:^ 
I desired the French gentleman not to say any thing to them till 
the business was thoroughly ripe, and I told him what answer 
the men had given me. 

Before I went from their quarter they all came to me, and 
told me they had been considering what I had said ; that they 
were very glad to hear I had a clergyman in my company ; and 



en. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 271 

they were very willing to give me the satisfaction I desired, and 
to be formally married as soon as I pleased. So I appointed 
them to meet me the next morning, and directed that, in the 
mean time, they should let their wives know the meaning of the 
marriage-law ; and that it was not only to prevent any scandal, 
but also to oblige them, that they should not forsake them, 
whatever might happen. 

The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the 
thing, and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had 
reason to be. So they failed not to attend all together at my 
apartment the next morning, where I brought out my clergyman ; 
and though he had not on the habit of a priest, yet having a 
black vest, something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did 
not look very unlike a clergyman ; and as for his language, I 
was his interpreter. 

But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the scruples 
he made of marrying the women, because they were not baptised 
and professed Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence for 
his person ; and there was no need after that to inquire whether 
he was a clergyman or not. 

When he came to them, he let them know that I had ac- 
quainted him with their circumstances, and with the present de- 
sign ; that he was very willing to perform that part of his function, 
and marry them, as I had desired. But that there was a diffi- 
culty in it, too, with respect to the laws of Christian matrimony, 
which he was not fully satisfied about, namely, that of marrying 
one that is a professed Christian to an idolater, one that is not 
baptised ; and yet that he did not see that there was time left 
to endeavour to persuade the women to be baptised, or to pro- 
fess the Name of Christ, whom they had, he doubted, heard 
nothing of, and without which they could not be baptised. 

He told them he feared thej were but indifierent Christians 
themselves, that they had but little knowledge of God or of His 
ways, and therefore he could not expect that they had said much 
to their wives on that head yet ; but that unless they would pro- 
mise him to use their endeavour with their wives to persuade 
them to become Christians, and would as well as they could in- 
struct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made them, 
and to worship Jesus Chbist that redeemed them, he could not 
marry them ; for he would have no hand in joining Christians 
with savages, nor was it consistent with the principles of the 
Christian religion. 

They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very 
faithfully to them, from his mouth, as near his own words as I 
could, only sometimes adding something of my own to convince 
them how just it was, and how I was oi his mmd ; and I always 
very faithfully distinguished between what I said from myself 
and what were the clergyman's words. They told me it was very| 



272 LIFE AND ADVBNTUBES FT. IL 

true what the gentleman had said, that they were bat very indif- 
ferent Christians themselves, and that they had never tuked to 
their wives about religion. " Sir," says Will Atkins, ** how 
should we teach them religion ? Why, we know nothing our- 
selves ; and besides, sir, should we go to talk with them of Odd 
and Jesus Christ, and heaven and hell, it would be to make 
tiiem laugh at us, and ask us what we believe ourselves. And if 
we should tell them we believe all the things that we speak of to 
them, such as of good people going to heaven and wicked people 
to the devil, they would ask us where we intend to go oarselvei 
that believe all this, and are such wicked fellows as we indeed 
are. Why, sir, it is enough to give them a surfeit of religion at 
first hearing: folks must have some reliffion themselves before 
tiiey pretend to teach other people." " Will Atkins,'' said I, 
*^ though I am afraid what you say has too much truth in it, yet 
can you not tell your wife that she is in the wrong ; that there ii 
a God and a religion better than her own ; that her gods an 
idols, that they can neither hear or speak ; that there is a greit 
Being that made all things, and that can destroy all that He bai 
made ; that He rewards the good and punishes the bad ; and that 
we are to be judged by Him at last for all we do here ? You are 
not so ignorant out even nature itself will teach you that all this 
is true ; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and be- 
lieve it yourself." 

"That is true, sir," said Atkins; "but with what face can I 
say any thing to my wife of all this, when she will tell me imme- 
diately it cannot be true?" 

" Not true !" said I ; " what do you mean by that?" ** Why, 
sir," said he, "she will tell me it cannot be true, that this God 
(I shall tell her of) can be just, or can punish or reward, since 
I am not punished, that have been such a wicked creature as she 
knows I have been, even to her, and to every body else ; and that 
I should be sufiered to live, that have been always acting so con- 
trary to what I must tell her is good, and to what I ought to 
have done." 

" Why truly, Atkins," said I, " I am afraid thou speakest 
too much truth ;" and with that I told the clergyman what 
Atkins had said ; for he was impatient to know. "Oh !*' said the 
priest, " tell him there is one thing will make him the best minis- 
ter in the world to his wife, and that is repentance ; for none 
teach repentance like true penitents. He wants nothing but to 
repent, und then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct 
his wife ; he will be then able to tell her, that there is not only 
a God, and that He is the just rewarder of good and evil, but 
that He is a merciful Being, and, with infinite goodness and long- 
sufiering, forbears to punish those that ofiiend ; waiting to be 
gracious, and willing not the death of a sinner, but rather that he 
should return and live ; that oftentimes He suffers wicked men to 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 273 

^o on for a long time, and even reserves damnation to the general 
day of retribution ; that it is a clear evidence of God^ and of a 
future state, that righteous men receive not their reward, or 
wicked men their punishment, till they come into another world ; 
and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resur- 
rection, and of the last judgment. Let him but repent for himself, 
he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife.'* 

I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the 
"while, and who, we could easily perceive, was more than ordi- 
narily affected with it ; when, being eager, and hardly suffering 
me to make an end — " I know all mis, master," says he, " and a 
great deal more ; but I have not the impudence to talk thus to 
my wife: when God and my own conscience know, and my 
wife will be an undeniable evidence against me, that I have lived 
as if I had never heard of a God, or future state, or any thing 
about it ; and to talk of my repenting:, alas V and with that he 
fetched a deep sigh ; and I could see that tears stood in his eyes, 
** it is past all that with me.*' " Past it! Atkins," said I ; "what 
dost thou mean by that ?" ^* I know well enough what I mean," 
says he ; ** I mean 'tis too late ; and that is too true." 

I told my clergyman word for word what he said. And this 
zealous, affectionate man could not refrain tears also. But re- 
covering himself, be said to me, " Ask him but one question. Is 
he easy that it is too late, or is he troubled, and wishes it were not 
so ?" I put the question fairly to Atkins ; and he answered with 
a great deal of passion, " How could any man be easy in a condi- 
tion that certainly must end in eternal destruction V That he 
was far from being easy ; but that, on the contrary, he believed 
it would one time or other ruin him. 

" What do you mean by that?" said I. ** Why," he replied, 
"I believe I shall one day or other cut my throat, to put an end 
to the terror of it." 

The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his face, 
when I told him all this ; but, turning quick to me upon it, said, 
" If that be his case, you may assure him it is not too late : 
Christ will give him repentance. But pray, explain this to 
him : that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merits of 
His passion, procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be too 
late for any man to receive mercy ? Does he think he is able to 
sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy ? Pray tell him, 
there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, 
and when God may refuse to hear ; but that it is never too late 
for men to ask mercy ; and we that are Christ's servants are 
commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the Name of Jesus 
Christ, to all those that sincerely repent: so that 'tis never too 
late." 

I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness ; 
but it seetned as if he turned off the discourse to the rest ; for he 



274 LIFE AND ADVENTUBES PT. II. 

said to me, he would go and have some talk to his wife. So he 
went out awhile, and we talked to the rest. I perceived they 
were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion ; much as 
I was when I went rambling away from my father : and yet that 
there were none of them backward to hear what had been said ; 
and all of them seriously promised, that they would talk with 
their wives about it, and do their endeavour to persuade them to 
turn Christians. 

The clergyman smiled upon me, when I reported what answer 
they gave, but said nothing a good while ; but at last, shaking his 
head, observed, "We that are Chjiist*s servants, can go no farther 
than to exhort and instruct ; and when men comply, submit to 
the reproof, and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do ; we are 
bound to accept their good words ; but, believe me, sir, whatever 
you may know of the life of that man you call Will Atkins, I 
oelieve he is the only sincere convert among them ; I will not 
despair of the rest ; but that man is apparently struck with the 
sense of his past life ; and I doubt not, but when he comes to 
talk of religion to his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it ,* 
for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best way of teach- 
ing ourselves." 

Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, 
to endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he 
married the other three couple. But Will Atkins and his wife 
were not yet come in. After this, my clergyman, waiting a 
while, was curious to know wher^ Atkins was gone ; and turn- 
ing to me, said, " I entreat you, sir, let us walk out of your 
labyrinth here, and look ; I dare say we shall find this poor man 
somewhere or other, talking seriously to his wife, and teaching 
her already something of religion." I began to be of the same 
mind ; so we went out together ; and I carried him a way which 
none knew but myself, and where the trees were so thick set, as 
that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and far 
harder to see in than to see out; when coming to the edge of 
the wood, I saw Atkins and his wife, sitting under the shade of a 
bush, very eager in discourse. I stopped short, till my clergy- 
man came up to me ; and then, having shewed him wnere they 
were, we stood and looked very steadily at them a good while. 

We observed him very earnest with her, pointing up to the 
sun and to every quarter of the heavens ; then down to the earth, 
then out to the sea, then to himself, then to her, to the woods, to 
the trees. '*Now," says my clergyman, "you see my words are 
made good ; the man preaches to her ; mark him ; now he is 
telling her that our God has made him, and her, and the heavens, 
the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, &c." " I believe he is," 
said I. Immediately we perceived Will Atkins start up upon his 
feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up both his hands ; we sup- 
posed he said something;, but could not hear him ; it was too nur 



en. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 275 

for that ; he did not continue kneeling half a minute, but comes 
and sits down again by his wife, and talks to her again. We 
perceived then the woman very attentive ; but whether she said 
any thing or not, we could not tell. While the poor fellow was 
upon his knees, I could see the tears run plentiiully down my 
clergyman's cheeks; and I could hardly forbear myself; but it 
was a great affliction to us both, that we were not near enough to 
hear any thing that passed between them. 

However, we could come no nearer, for fear of disturbing 
them ; so we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conver- 
sation ; and it spoke loud enough to us, without the help of voice. 
He sat down again, as I have said, close by her, and talked again 
earnestly to her ; and two or three times we could see him em- 
brace her most passionately ; another time we saw him take out 
his handkerchief and wipe her eyes, and then kiss her again, 
"with a kind of transport very unusual ; and after several of these 
things, we saw him on a sudden jump up again, and lend her his 
hand to help her up ; when immediately leading her by the hand 
a step or two, they both kneeled down together, and continued 
so about two minutes. 

My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, *' St. 
Paul, St. Paul ! behold he prayeth \" I was afraid Atkins would 
hear him ; therefore I entreated him to withhold himself a while, 
that we might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must con- 
fess, was the most affecting, and yet the most agreeable, that ever 
I saw in my life. Well, he strove with himself, and contained 
himself for a while, but was in such raptures^f joy to think that 
the poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was 
not able to contain himself; he wept several times ; then throw- 
ing up his hands, and crossing his breast, said over several things 
ejaculatory, and by way of giving God thanks for so miraculous 
a testimony of the success of our endeavours ; some he spoke 
softly, and I could not well hear ; others audibly ; some in Latin, 
some in French ; then two or three times the tears of joy would 
interrupt him, that he could not speak at all. But I begged that 
he would compose himself, and let us more narrowly and fully 
observe what was before us ; which he did for a time. The 
scene was not ended there yet ; for after the poor man and his 
"wife were risen again from their knees, we observed he stood talk- 
ing still eagerly to her; and we observed by her motion that she 
was greatly affected with what he said, by her frequent lifting up 
her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and such other postures 
as usuallv express the greatest seriousness and attention. This 
continued about half a quarter of an hour, and then they walked 
away too; so that we could see no more of them in that situation. 

As Will Atkins and his wife were gone, our business there 
•was over ; so we went back our own way ; and when we came 
back, we found them waiting to be called in. Observing this, I 



276 LIFfi AND ADVSNTT7BBS FT. IL 

asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we had 
seen theoi or not ; and it was his opinion we elioold not ; bat thit 
we should talk to him first, and hear what he would say to os. 
So we called him in alone, nobody being in the place bat oor- 
selves ; and I began with him thus : 

"Will Atkins," said I, "prithee what education had you? 
What was your father V 

W, A, A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, my fiidier 
was a clergyman. 

R, C. What education did he give you? 

W, A, He would have taught me well, sir ; hut I despised 
all education, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was. 

J?. C, It's true, Solomon says, "He that despises reproof ■ 
brutish." 

W, A, A.Y, sir, I was brutish indeed ; I murdered my ft* 
ther. For God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir; I mitf- 
dered my poor father. 

Priest. Ha ! a murderer ? 

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word as he 
spoke it) and looked pale. It seems he believed that Will bad 
really killed his own father. 

ic. C. No, no, sir, I do not understand him so. Will Atkinii 
explain yourself; you did not kill your father, did you, witk 
your own hands ? 

W. A, No, sir, I did not cut his throat ; hut I cut tbe 
thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days ; I broke hii 
heart by the most ungrateful unnatural return for the most tea-* 
der affectionate treatment that ever father gave, or child could 
receive. 

jR. C Well, I did not ask you about your father, to extort 
this confession; I pray God give you repentance for it, an! 
forgive you that, and all your other sins; but I asked yoot 
because I see that though you have not much learning', yet yoi 
are not so ignorant as some are in things that are good - w 
you have known more of religion a great deal than you have 
practised. 

W, A, Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that I 
make about my father, conscience does ; and whenever we come 
to look back upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent pa- 
rents are certainly the first that touch us ; the wounds they make 
lie deepest ; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the 
mind, of all the sins we can commit. 

R, C, You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins; 
I cannot bear it. 

W, A. You bear it, master! I dare say you know nothioir 
of it. 

i?. C. Yes, Atkins ; every shore, every hill, nay, I mar 
say, every tree in this island, is witness to the anguish of my 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 277 

soul, for my ingratitude and base usage of a good tender father ; 
a father much like yours, by your description ; and I murdered 
my father as well as you. Will Atkins ; but I think, for all that, 
my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal. 

I would have said more, if I coulcf have restrained my pas- 
sions; but I thought this poor man's repentance was so much 
sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave off the discourse, 
and retire, for I was surprised with what he said ; and thought 
that instead of my going about to teach and instruct him, the 
man was made a teacher and instructor to me, in a most surpris- 
ing and unexpected manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly 
affected with it. And then, having a httle composed myself, I 
renewed my discourse with Will Atkins. 

** But Virill," said I, " how comes the sense of this matter to 
touch you just now V 

W. A, Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a 
dart through my very soul ; I have been talking about God and 
religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a 
Christtian of her ; and she has not only consented to become so, 
but preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget while 
I live. 

JR. C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached to you ; but 
when you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience 
has flung them back upon you. 

W. A, Ay, sir, with such a force as is not to be resisted. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and 
your wife ; for I know something of it already. 

W,A, Sir, it is impossible to give you a uill account of it: I 
am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express ; but let 
her have said what she will, and though I cannot give you an 
account of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and 
reform my life. 

This was strange news, and very affecting to us both, but par- 
ticularly to the young clergyman, who was under the greatest 
affliction that he could not talk to her, that he could not speak 
English to make her understand him ; and as she spoke but very 
broken English, he could not understand her. However, he 
turned himself to me, and told me, that he believed there must 
be more to do with this woman than to marry her . I did not 
understand him at first; but at length he explained himself, 
namely, that she ought to be baptised. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for going 
about it presently. "No, no; hold, sir," said he, "though I 
would have her be baptised by all means, yet I must observe, that 
Will Atkins, her husband, has, indeed, brought her, in a won- 
derful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life ; yet I 
desire to know of him, if he has said any thing to her of Jesus 

B B 



278 LIFE AND ADVfiXTURBS FT. II. 

Christ, and of the salvation of sinners ; of the nature of £edth 
in Him, and redemption by Him ; of the Holy Spirit, the re- 
surrection, the last judgment, and a future state. 

I called Will Atkins again, and asked him ; but the poor 
fellow fell immediately into tears, and told us, he had said some- 
thing to her of all those things, but that he was himself so wicked 
a creature, and his own conscience so reproached him with his 
ungodly life, that he trembled at the apprehensions, that her 
knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should give to 
those thmgs, and make her rather contemn religion than receive 
it ; but he was assured, he said, that her mind was so dbposed 
to receive due impressions of all those things, that if I would bat 
discourse with her, she would make it appear, to my satisfaction, 
that my labour would not be lost upon her. 

Accordingly I called her in, and placing myself as interpre- 
ter between my religious priest and the woman, I entreated him 
to begin with her ; and sure a better sermon was never preached 
in these latter ages of the world. 

In a word, he brought the poor woman to embrace the know- 
ledge of Christ, and of redemption by Him, not with wonder and 
astonishment only, but with joy and faith, with an affectiou, and 
a surprising degree of understanding, scarcely to be imagined, 
much less to be expressed ; and at her own request she was bap- 
tised. 

As soon as this was over, we married them ; and after the 
marriage was over, the priest turned himself to Will Atkins, and 
in a very affectionate manner exhorted him not only to perse- 
vere in that good disposition he was in, but to support the con- 
victions that were upon him, by a resolution to reform his life : 
told him, it was in vain to sav he repented, if he did not forsake 
his crimes ; represented to him, how God had honoured him 
with being the instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge 
of the Christian religion ; and that he should be careful he did 
not dishonour the grace of God ; and that if he did, he would 
see the heathen a better Christian than himself ; the savage con- 
verted, and the instrument cast away. 

He said a great many good things to them both, and then 
recommending them, in a few words, to God's goodness, gave 
them the benediction, I repeating every thing to them in English. 
And thus ended the ceremony. 1 think it was the most pleasant, 
agreeable day to me that ever I passed in my whole life. 

But my clergyman had not done yet. His thoughts hung con- 
tinually upon the conversion of the seven-and -thirty savages ; and 
he would fain have stayed upon the island to have undertaken it; 
but I convinced him, first, that his undertaking was impracti- 
rable in itself; and, secondly, that perhaps I would put it into a 
way of being done, in his alisence, to his satisfaction. 

Having thus brought the affairs of the island to a narrow 



CH. III. OF BOBINSON CRUSOB. 279 

compass, I was preparing to go on board the ship, when the 
young man that I had taken out of the famished ship's company 
came to me, and told me, he understood I had a clergyman 
with me, and that I had caused the Englishmen to be married 
to the savages, whom they called wives ; that he had a match 
too, which he desired might be finished before I went, be- 
tween two Christians ; which he hoped would not be disagreeable 
to me. 

I knew this must be the young woman who was his mother*8 
servant, for there was no other Christian woman on the island ; 
so I began to persuade him not to do any thing of that kind 
rashly, or because he found himself in these solitary circumstances. 
I represented to him, that he had some considerable substance in 
the world, and good friends, as I understood by himself and by 
his maid also ; that the maid was not only poor, and a servant, 
but was unequal to him, she being six or seven-and-twenty years 
old, and he not above seventeen or eighteen ; that he might very 
probably, with my assistance, remove from this wilderness, and 
come into his own country again ; and that then it would be a 
thousand to one but he would repent his choice ; and the dislike 
of that circumstance might be disadvantageous to both. I was 
going to say more, but he interrupted me, smiling ; and told ' 
me, with a great deal of modesty, that I mistook in my guesses ; 
that he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts, his present cir- 
cumstances being melancholy and disconsolate enough; and he 
was very glad to hear, that I had thoughts of putting them in a 
way to see their country again ; and nothing should have put 
him u])on staying there, but that the voyage I was going was so 
exceeding long and hazardous, and would carry him quite out of 
the reach of all his friends ; that he had nothing to desire of me 
but that I would settle him in some little property in the island 
where he was ; give him a servant or two, and some few neces- 
saries, and he would settle himself like a planter, waiting the 
food time when, if ever I returned to England, I would redeem 
im, and hoped I would not be unmindful of him when I came 
into England ; that he would give me some letters to his friends 
in London, to let them know now good I had been to him, and 
in what part of the world, and what circumstances I had lefb 
him in ; that whenever I redeemed him, the plantation, and all 
the improvements he had made upon it, let the value be what it 
would, should be wholly mine. 

His discourse was very prettily delivered, considering his 
youth ; and was the more agreeable to me, because he told me 
positively the match was not for himself. I gave him all pos- 
sible assurances, that if I lived to come safe to England, I would 
deliver his letters, and do his business effectually ; and that he 
might depend I would never forget the circumstances I left him 
in. But still I was impatient to know who was the person to be 



280 LIFE AND ADVENTTTRfiS PT. II. 

married ; upon which^ he told me it was my Jack-of-all-trades 
and his maid Sasan. 

I was most agreeably surprised when he named the match ; 
for, indeed, I thought it very suitable. The character of that 
man I have given edready ; and as for the maid, she was a very 
honest, modest, sober, and religious young woman ; had a very 
good share of sense ; was agreeable enough in her person ; spoke 
very handsomely, and to the purpose ; was very handy and 
housewifely in any thing that was before her ; an excellent man- 
ager, and nt indeed to have been governess to the whole island ; 
she knew very well how to behave to all kinds of folk she had 
about her, and to better, if she had found any there. 

The match being proposed in this manner, we married them 
the same day ; and, as I was father at the altar, as I may say, 
and gave her away, so I gave her a portion ; for I appointed her 
and her husband a handsome large space of ground for their 
plantation. And indeed this match, and the proposal the young 
gentleman made, to give him a small property in the island, put 
me upon parcelling it out amongst them, that they might not 
quarrel afterwards about their situation. 

This sharing out the land to them I left to Will Atkins, who, 
indeed, was now grown a most sober, grave, managing fellow, 
perfectly reformed, and, as far as I may be allowed to speak 
positively in such a case, a sincere penitent. 

He divided things so justly, and so much to every one's satis- 
faction, that they only desired one general writing under my 
hand for the whole. This I caused to be drawn up, and signed 
and sealed to them, setting out the bounds and situation of every 
man's plantation, and testifying that I gave them thereby, seve- 
rally, a right to the whole possession and the inheritance of the 
respective plantations or farms, with their improvements, to 
them and their heirs ; reserving all the rest of the island as my 
own property, and a certain rent for every particular plantation, 
after eleven years, if I, or any one from me, or in my name, 
came to demand it, producing an attested copy of the same 
writing. 

As to the government and laws among them, I told them 
I was not capable of giving them better rules than they were able 
to give themselves. I only made them promise me to live in 
love and good neighbourhood with one another ; and so I pre- 
pared to leave them. 

One thing I must not omit ; and this is, that being now set- 
tled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves, and having 
much business in hand, it was but odd to have seven-and- thirty 
Indians live in a nook of the island, independent, and, indeed, 
unemployed ; for, excepting the providing themselves food^ which 
they had difficulty enough in too sometimes, they had no man- 
ner of business or property to manage. I proposed therefore to 



CH. III. OF B0BIN80N CRUSOB. 281 

the governor Spaniard that he should go to them with Friday's 
father, and propose to them to remove, and either plant for 
themselves or take them into their several families as servants, 
to be maintained for their labour, but without being absolute 
slaves. 

They most willingly embraced the proposal, and came all 
very cheerfully along with him ; so we allotted them land and 
plantations, which three or four accepted of, but all the rest 
chose to be employed as servants. And thus my colony was in 
a manner settled as follows : the Spaniards possessed my original 
habitation, which was the capital city, and extended their planta- 
tions all along the side of the brook, which made the creek that 
I have so often described, as far as my bower ; and as thev in- 
creased their culture, it went always eastward ; the English lived 
in the north-east part, where Will Atkins and his comrades be- 
gan, and came on southward and south-west towards the back 
part of the Spaniards ^ and every plantation had a great addi- 
tion of land to take in, if they found occasion, so that they need 
not jostle one another for want of room, 

AH the east end of the island was left uninhabited, that if any 
of the savages should come on shore there, only for their usual 
customary barbarities, they might come and go ; if they disturbed 
nobody, nobody would disturb them. And no doubt but they 
were often ashore, and went away again ; for I never heard that 
the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more. 

It now came into my thoughts, that I had hmted to my friend 
the clergyman, that the work of converting the savages might, 
perhaps, be set on foot in his absence, to his satisfaction ; and I 
told him, that now I thought it was put in a fair way ; for the 
savages being thus divided among the Christians, if tney would 
but every one of them do their part with those which cameimder 
their hands, I hoped it might iiave a very good effect. 

He agreed presently in that. " If," said he, " they will do 
their part ; but how shall we obtain that of them V* I told him, 
we would call them all together, and leave it in charge with 
them, or go to them one by one, which he thought best. So we 
divided it ; he to speak to the Spaniards, and I to the English ; 
and we recommended it earnestly to them, and made them pro- 
mise, that, in their exhorting the savages to turn Christians, they 
would teach them the knowledge of the true God, and of their 
Saviour Jesus Christ. 

It came next into my mind, that amongst all the needful 
things I had to leave with them, I had not left them a Bible ; in 
which I shewed myself less considering for them, than my good 
friend the widow was for me when she sent me the cargo of an 
hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles 
and a Prayer-book, However the good woman's charity had a 
greater extent than ever she imagined ; for they were reserved 

B b2 



282 LIFE AND ADVENTURBS FT. II. 

for the comfort and instruction of those that made much better 
use ofsthem than I had done. 

I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and walked to Will 
Atkins's tent, or house ; where I found that the young woman I 
have mentioned above and Atkins's baptised wife bad become 
intimate, and had been discoursing of religion together; for Will 
Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy. I asked if they were 
together now? And he said ** Yes." So I went into the bouse, 
and he with me, and we found them together, very earnest in 
discourse. ** Oh, sir !" says Will Atkins, " when God has sinners 
to reconcile to Himself, and aliens to bring home, He never wants 
a messenger. My wife has got a new instructor ; I knew I was 
unworthy, as I was incapable of that work ; that young woman 
has been sent hither from Heaven ; she is enoush to convert a 
whole island of savages." The young woman blushed, and rose 
up to go away, but I desired her to sit still ; I told her she 
had a good work upon her hands, and I hoped God would bless 
her in it. 

We talked a little, and I did not perceive they had any book 
among them, though 1 did not ask ; but I put my hand in my 
pocket, and pulled out my Bible. " Here," says I to A^ins, 
*^ I have brought you an assistant, that, perhaps, you had not 
before." The man was so confounded, that he was not able to 
speak for some time ; but recovering himself, he took it with both 
his hands, and turning to his wife, " Here, my dear," says he, 
*' did not I tell you, our God, though He lives above, could hear 
what we said ? Here's the book we have wished and prayed for ; 
now God has heard us and sent it." When he had said thus, the 
man fell into such transports of a passionate }oj, that between 
the joy of having it, and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran 
down his face like a child. 

The woman was surprised, and had like to have run into a 
mistake, that none of us were aware of; for she firmly believed 
God had sent the book by an express messenger from heaven, 
upon her husband's petition. So I turned to the maid-servant, 
and told her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert, 
in her first and more ignorant understanding of things ; and beg- 
ged her to explain to her, that God may be very properly said 
to answer our petitions, when, in the course of His providence, 
such things are, in a particular manner, brought to pass, as we 
petitioned for ; and that we do not expect returns from Heaven 
in a miraculous and particular manner. 

Surely no man was ever more thankful in the world for any 
thing of its kind, than Atkins was for this Bible ; nor I believe was 
any man ever glad of a Bible from a better principle ; and though 
he had been a most profligate creature, desperate, headstrong, out- 
rageous, furious, and wicked to a great degree, yet this man is a 
standing rule to us all for the well instructing children, namely, 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 283 

that parents should never give over to teach and instruct, or ever 
despair of the success of their endeavours, let their children be ever 
so obstinate, refractory, or, to appearance, insensible of instruc- 
tion ; for if ever God in His providence touches the consciences 
of such, the force of their education returns upon them, and the 
early instruction of parents is not lost, though it may have been 
many years laid asleep ; but some time or other they may find 
the benefit of it. 

Thus it was with this poor man. However ignorant he was, 
or divested of religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had 
some to do with now more ignorant than himself; and that the 
least part of the instruction of his good father, that could now 
come to his mind, was of use to him. 

But to return to my disposition of things among the people. 
First, it is to be observed, that, for many reasons, I did not 
think fit to let them know any thing of the sloop I had framed, 
and which I thought of setting up amon? them ; for I found, at 
least at my first coming, such seeds of division among them, that 
I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it among them,- 
they would, upon very light disgust, have separated, and gone 
away from one another ; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so 
made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober 
and religious people. Nor did I leave the two pieces of brass can- 
non that I had on board, or the two quarter-deck guns that my 
nephew took extraordinarily, for the same reason. I thought there 
was enough to qualify them for a defensive war, against any that 
should invade them ; but not to set them up for an offensive war, 
or to encourage them to go abroad to attack others, which, in the 
end, would only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and 
all their undertaking. I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the 
guns, for their service another way; as I shall observe in its 
place. 




I 



t them with a glass, cried out it was an army. I conid not 



CH. IV. ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 285 

imagine what he meant by an army, and spoke a little hastily, 
calling the fellow a fool, or some such word. " Nay, sir," says 
he, '^ do not be angry ; for it is an army and a fleet too ; ror 
I believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them 
paddle along, and they are coming towards us too, apace." 

I was a little surprised then, mdeed, and so was my nephew 
the captain ; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in 
the island, and having never been in those seas before, that he 
could not tell what to think of it, but said two or three times, 
we shall all be devoured. I must confess, considering we were 
becalmed, and the current set strong towards the shore, I liked 
it the worse : however, I bade him not be afraid, but bring the 
ship to an anchor, as soon as we came so near as to know that 
we must engage them. 

In a little while they came up with us ; but never was such a 
horrid sight seen by Christians. My mate, however, was mistaken 
in his calculation of their number, I mean of a thousand canoes; 
the most we could make of them when they came up, being 
about a hundred and twenty ; some of them had sixteen or seven- 
teen men in them, and some more, and the least six or seven. 

When they came nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with 
wonder and astonishment, as at a sight which they had, doubt- 
less, never seen before ; nor could they, at first, as we afterwards 
understood, know what to make of us. They came boldly up 
however, very near to us, and seemed to design to row round us ; 
but we called to our men in the boats not to let them come too 
near them. 

This very order brought us to an engagement with them, 
without our mtending ; for five or six of their large canoes came 
so near our long-boat, that our men beckoned with their hands 
to them to keep back ; which they understood very well, and 
went back ; but at their retreat about fifty arrows came on board 
us from those boats ; and one of our men in the long-boat was 
very much wounded. 

However, I called to them not to fire by any means ; but we 
handed down some deal boards into the boat, and the carpenter 
presently set up a kind of fence, like waste-boards, to cover 
them from the arrows of the savages^ if they should shoot 



again. 



About half an hour afterwards they came all up in a body 
astern of us, and pretty near us; so near that we could easily 
discern what they were, though we could not tell their design. 
And I easily found they were some of my old friends, the same 
sort of savages that I had been used to engage with ; and in a 
little time more they rowed a little farther out to sea, till they 
came directly broadside with us, and then rowed down straight 
upon us, till they came so near that they could hear us speak. 
Upon this, Friday immediately cried out; they were going to

shoot ; and unhappily for him (poor fellow !) they let fly ahoat 
300 of their arrows ; and, to my inexpressible grief, killed poor 
Priday, no other man being in their sight. The poor fellow was 
shot with no less than three arrows, and about three more fell 
very near him : such unlucky marksmen they were. 

I was so enraged at the loss of my old servant, the companion 
of all my sorrows and solitudes, that I immediately ordered ^ve 
guns to be loaded with small shot, and four with great ; and gave 
them such a broadside as they had never heard in their lives be* 
fore. They were not above half a cable's length off when we fired ; 
and our gunners took their aim so well, that three or four of 
their canoes were overset^ as we had reason to believe^ by one 
shot only. 

I can neither tell how many we killed, or how many we 
wounded, at this broadside ; but such a fright and hurry never 
was seen among such a multitude. There were thirteen or four- 
teen of their canoes split, and overset, in all : and the men all set 
a swimming. The rest, frightened out of their wits, acoured 
away as fast as they could, taking but little care to save those 
whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot ; so I suppose 
that they were many of them lost ; and our men took up one 
poor fellow swimming for his life, a full hour after they were all 
gone. 

The same evening we weighed and set sail again ; but I was 
the most disconsolate creature alive, for want of my man Friday, 
and would have been very glad to have gone back to the island, 
to have taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion, but it 
could not be ; so we went on. We had one prisoner, as I have 
said ; and it was a long while before we could make him under- 
stand any thing ; but, in time, our men taught him some Eng- 
lish, and he began to be a little tractable. Afterwards we in- 
quired what country he came from, but could make nothing of 
what he said ; for his speech was so odd, that we could never 
form a word after him, and we were all of opinion that they 
might speak that language as well if they were gagged as other- 
wise ; nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either 
for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate ; but formed their words just as 
a hunting-horn forms a tune, with an open throat. He told us, 
however, some time after, when we had taught him to speak a 
little English, that they were going with their kings, to flght a 

freat battle. When he said King$i, we asked him, how many 
ings ? He said there were five nation, and that they all joined 
to go against two nation. We asked him, what made them come 
up to us? He said, ** To makee te great wonder look." Where 
it is to be observed, tliat all those natives, as also those of Africa, 
when they learn English, always add two e's at the end of the 
words where we use one, and place the accent upon them ; as 
makee takee, and the like; and we could not break them, of it; 



CR. IV. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 287 

nay, I could hardly make Friday leave it off, though at last be 
did. 

And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my 
last leave of him ; poor honest Friday ! We buried him with all 
tbe decency and solemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin, 
and committing him to the sea ; and I caused them to fire eleven 
guns for him : and so ended the career of the most grateful, 
faithful, honest, and affectionate servant that ever man had. 

We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil, and in about 
twelve days' time we made land in the latitude of five degrees 
south of the line, being the north-easternmost land of all that part 
of America. We kept on s. by b. in sight of the shore four days, 
when we made the Cape S. Augustine ; and in three days came 
to an anchor off the Bay of All Saints, the old place of my 
deliverance. 

Never did a ship come to this part that had less business than 
I had ; and yet it was with great aifficulty that we were admitted 
to hold the least correspondence on shore ; and this upon condi- 
tion absolutely capitulated for, that we should not offer to land 
any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person away without 
license. 

They were so strict with us, as to landing any goods, that it 
was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore three bales of 
English ffoods, such as fine broad cloths, stuffs, and some linen, 
which I had brought for a present to my partner. 

He was a very generous man, though (like me) he came from 
little at first ; and though he knew not that I had the least design 
of giving him any thing, he sent me on board a present of fresh 
provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores, 
including some tobacco, and three or four fine* medals in gold. 
But I was even with him in my present above mentioned ; and 
I also delivered him about the value of 100/. sterling, in the 
same goods, for other uses ; and obliged him to set up the sloop 
which I had brought with me from England, for the use of my 
colony, in order to send the refreshments I intended to my plan- 
tation. 

Accordingly he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very 
few days, for she was already framed ; and I gave the master of 
her such instructions as he could not miss the place. I got him 
soon loaded with the small cargo I sent them ; ^nd one of our 
seamen, that had been on shore with me there, offered to go with 
the sloop, and settle there, upon my letter to the governor Spa- 
niard to allot him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation, 
and giving him some clothes, and tools for his planting work, 
which he said he understood, having been an old planter in 
Maryland, and a buccaneer into the bargain. 

I encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired ; and, 
as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we had taken 



276 LIFE AND ADVBXTURBS FT. II. 

asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we bad 
seen them or not ; and it was his opinion we should not ; but that 
we should talk ^o him first, and hear what he would say to us. 
So we called him in alone, nobody being in the place but our- 
selves ; and I began with him thus : 

** Will Atkins," said I, " prithee what education bad you ? 
What was your father 1" 

W, A, A better man than ever I shall be. Sir, my fiither 
was a clergyman. 

R, C, What education did he give you ? 

W, A, He would have taught me well, sir ; but I despised 
all education, instruction, or correction, like a beast as I was. 

H. C. It's true, Solomon says, '^ He that despises reproof is 
brutish." 

W, A. Ay, sir, I was brutish indeed ; I murdered my fii- 
ther. For God's sake, sir, talk no more about that, sir ; I mur- 
dered my poor father. 

Priest, Ha ! a murderer ? 

Here the priest started (for I interpreted every word as be 
spoke it) and looked pale. It seems he believed that Will had 
really killed his own father. 

it. C No, no, sir, I do not understand him so. Will Atkins, 
explain yourself; you did not kill your father, did you, with 
your own hands? 

W. A, No, sir, I did not cut his throat ; but I cut the 
thread of all his comforts, and shortened his days ; I broke his 
heart by the most ungrateful unnatural return for the most ten-* 
der affectionate treatment that ever father gave, or child could 
receive. 

jR. C Well, I did not ask you about your father, to extort 
this confession; I pray God give you repentance for it, and 
forgive you that, and all your other sins ; but I asked you, 
because I see that though you have not much learning, yet you 
are not so ignorant as some are in things that are good ; mat ; 
you have known more of religion a great deal than you have ' 
practised. 

W, A, Though you, sir, did not extort the confession that I 
make about my father, conscience does ; and whenever we come 
to look back upon our lives, the sins against our indulgent pa- 
rents are certainly the first that touch us ; the wounds they make 
lie deepest ; and the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the 
mind, of all the sins we can commit. 

B. C, You talk too feelingly and sensibly for me, Atkins; 
I cannot bear it. 

W, A, You bear it, master! I dare say you know nothing 
of it. 

R, C Yes, Atkins ; every shore, every hill, nay, I may 
say, every tree in this island, is witness to the anguish of my 



CH. III. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 277 

soul, for my ingratitude and base usi^e of a good tender father ; 
a father much like yours, by your description ; and I murdered 
my father as well as you. Will Atkins ; but I lliink, for all that, 
my repentance is short of yours too, by a great deal. 

I would have said more, if I coula have restrained my pas- 
sions; but I thought this poor man's repentance was so much 
sincerer than mine, that I was going to leave off the discourse^ 
and retire, for I was surprised with what he said ; and thought 
that instead of my going about to teach and instruct him, the 
man was made a teacher and instructor to me^ in a most surpris- 
ing and unexpected manner. 

I laid all this before the young clergyman, who was greatly 
affected with it. And then, having a httle composed myself, I 
renewed my discourse with Will Atkins. 

'' But Will/' said I, <^ how comes the sense of this matter to 
touch you just now?" 

W. A, Sir, you have set me about a work that has struck a 
dart through my very soul ; I have been talking about God and 
religion to my wife, in order, as you directed me, to make a 
Christtian of her ; and she has not only consented to become so, 
but preached such a sermon to me as I shall never forget while 
I live. 

R, C. No, no ; it is not your wife has preached to you ; but 
when you were moving religious arguments to her, conscience 
has flung them back upon you. 

W, A, Ay, sir, witn such a force as is not to be resisted. 

R. C. Pray, Will, let us know what passed between you and 
your wife ; for I know something of it already* 

W. A . Sir, it is impossible to give you a uill account of it : I 
am too full to hold it, and yet have no tongue to express ; but let 
her have said what she will, and though I cannot give you an 
account of it, this I can tell you of it, that I resolve to amend and 
reform my life. 

This was strange news, and very affecting to us both, but par- 
ticularly to the young clergyman, who was under the greatest 
affliction that he could not talk to her, that he could not speak 
English to make her understand him ; and as she sfK)ke but very 
broken English, he could not understand her. However, he 
turned himself to me, and told me, that he believed there must 
be more to do with this woman than to marry her . I did not 
understand him at first; but at length he explained himself, 
namely, that she ought to be baptised. 

I agreed with him in that part readily, and was for goin? 
about it presently. "No, no; hold, sir," said he, "though! 
would have her be baptised by all means, yet I must observe, that 
Will Atkins, her husband, has, indeed, brought her, in a won- 
derful manner, to be willing to embrace a religious life ; yet I 
desire to know of him, if he has said any thing to her of Jssus

290 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

"where, though the people are fierce and treacherous, and, in 
particular, very well armed with lances and bows, which they 
use with inconceivable dexterity, yet we fared very well with 
them a while ; they treated us very civilly ; and for some trifles 
which we gave them, such as knives, scissors, &c. they brought 
us eleven good fat bullocks, middling in size, but very good in 
flesh, which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for our pre- 
sent eating, and the rest to salt for the ship's use. 

We were obliged to stay here some time, after we had fur- 
nished ourselves with provisions ; and I was for going on shore 
as often as 1 could. It was on the east side of the island that 
we went on shore one evening; and the people, who, by the 
way, were very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood 
gazing at us from a distance ; but as we had traded freely with 
them, and had been kindly used, we thought ourselves in no 
danger : but when we saw the people, we cut three boughs oat 
of a tree, and stuck them at a distance from us, which, it seems, 
is a mark in the country, not only of truce and friendship, but 
when it is accepted, the other side sets up three poles or boughs ; 
which is a signal that they accept the truce too ; but then this is 
a known condition of the truce, that you are not to pass beyond 
their three poles towards them, nor they come past your three 
poles or boughs towards you ; so that you are perfectly secure 
within the three poles ; and all the space between your three 
poles and theirs is allowed like a market, for free converse, 
traffic, and commerce. When you go there, you must not carry 
your weapons with you ; and if they come into that space, they 
stick up their javelins and lances all at the first poles, and come 
on unarmed ; but if any violence is oftered them, and the truce 
thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay hold of 
their weapons, and then the truce is at an end. 

It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a 
greater number of their people came down than usual; but all 
was verjr friendly and civil, and they brought in several kinds 
of provisions, for which we satisfied them with such toys as we 
had: their women also brought us milk and roots, and several 
things very acceptable to us, and all was quiet ; and we made 
us a little tent, or hut, of some boughs of trees, and stayed on 
shore all night. 

I know not what was the occasion, but I was not so well 
satisfied to remain on shore as the rest; and the, boat riding 
at anchor about a stone-cast hr\n the land, with two men in 
her to take care of her, I made one of them come on shore, and 
gettinir some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat, I spread 
the sail on the bottom of the boat, and la} under the cover of the 
branches of trees all night in the boat. 

About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men 
make a terrible noise on shore, calling out to us to bring the 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, 291 

boat in, and come and help them, for they were all like to be 
murdered ; at the same time I heard the fire of five muskets, 
which was the number of the guns they had, and that three 
times over; for, it seems, the natives here were not so easily 
frightened with guns as the savages were in America, where I 
had to do with tnem. 

All this while I knew not what was the matter ; but rousing 
immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be 
thrust in, and resolved to land and assist* our men. 

We got the boat soon to the shore ; but our men were in toi 
much haste ; for, being come to the land, they plunged into the 
water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they could, 
being pursued by between three and four hundred men. Our 
men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees with 
them ; the rest had indeed pistols and swords, but they were of 
small use to them. 

We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough 
too, three of them being very ill wounded ; and that which was 
still worse, was, that while we stood in the boat to take our men 
in, we were in as much danger as they were in on shore ; for 
they poured their arrows in upon us so thick, that we wore fain 
to barricade the side of the boat with the benches, and two or 
three loose boards, which, to our great satisfaction, we iiad, by 
mere accident, or providence, in the boat. 

And yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact 
marksmen, that if they could have seen the least part of any of 
us, they would have been sure of us : but we had, by the light of 
the moon, a little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from 
the shore with darts and arrows ; so, having got ready our fire- 
arms, we gave them a volley : and we could hear by the cries 
of some of them, that we had wounded several. However, they 
stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day, which 
we suppose was, that they might see the better to take their aim 
at us. 

In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our 
anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in 
the boat, and they were as sure to hit us, as we were to hit a 
bird in a tree witn small shot. We made signals of distress to 
the ship, which, though a league ofi\ yet the captain, hearing 
our firing, and perceiving the posture we lay in, and that we 
fired towards the shore, pretty well understood us ; and, weigh- 
ing: anchor witH all speed, he stood as near the shore as he durst 
with the ship, and then sent another boat, with ten hands in her, 
to assist us. They stood in nearer to us, and one of the men, 
taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and keeping our boat 
between him and the enemy, so that they could not perfectly 
see him, swam on board us, and made the line fast to the boat ; 
upon which we slipt our little cable, and leaving our anchor 



292 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II, 

behind, they towed us out of the reach of the arrows ; we all the 
while lying close behind the barricade we had made. 

As soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore, 
so that she could lay her side to the shore, she ran along just by 
them, and poured in a broadside among them, loaded with pieces 
of iron and lead, small bullets and such stuff, besides the great 
shot, which made a terrible havoc amongst them. 

When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time 
to examine into the occasion of this fray ; and, indeed, our super- 
cargo, who had been often in those parts, put me upon it ; for 
he said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us 
after we had made a truce, if we had not done something to 
provoke them to it. At length it came out; namely, that an 
old woman, who had come to sell us some milk, had brought it 
within our poles, accompanied by a young woman, who also 
brought some roots or herbs ; and while the old woman (whether 
she was mother to the young woman or not, they could not tell) 
was selling us the xuHk, one of our men offered some rudeness 
to the girl that was with her ; at which the old woman made 
a great noise. However, the seaman would not quit his prize, 
but carried her out of the old woman's sight, it being almost 
dark : the old woman went away without her; and, as we sup- 
pose, made an outcry among the people she came from, who, 
upon notice, raised this great army upon us in three or four 
hours ; and it was great odds but we had all been destroyed. 

One of our men was killed with a lance that was thrown at 
him, just at the beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the 
tent they had made ; the rest came off free, all but the fellow 
who was the occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough 
for his bad behaviour, for we could not hear what became of him 
a great while. We lay upon the shore two days after, though 
the wind presented, and made signals for him ; made our boat 
sail up shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain ; so 
we were obliged to give him over: and if he alone had suffered 
for it, the loss had been the less. 

I could not satisfy myself, however, without venturing on 
shore once more, to try if I could learn any thing of him or 
them. It was the third night after the action, that I had a 
great mind to learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we 
had done, and how the game stood on the Indians' side. I was 
careful to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again ; 
but I ought indeed to have been sure that the irien I went with 
had been under my command, before I engaged in a thing so 
hazardous and mischievous as I was brought into by it, without 
my knowledge or desire. 

We took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the ship, 
besides the supercargo and myself; and we landed two hour^i 
before midnight^ at the same place where the Indians stood 



CH. V. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 293 

drawn up the evening before. I landed here, because my de- 
sign, as I have said, was chiefly to see if they had quitted the 
field, and if they had left any marks behind them, or of the 
mischief we had done them ; and I thought, if we could sur- 
prise one or two of them, perhaps we might get our man again, 
by way of exchange. 

We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two 
bodies, whereof the boatswain commanded one, and I the other. 
We neither saw nor heard any body stir when we landed ; and 
ive marched up, one body at a distance from the other, to the 
place, but at first could see nothing, it being very dark ; till by 
and by, our boatswain, t^tiat led the first party, stumbled and 
fell over a dead body. This made them halt awhile ; for, know- 
ing by the circumstances that they were at the place where the 
Indians had stood, they waited for my coming up here ; we con- 
cluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which we knew would 
be in less than an hour, when we could easily discern the havoc 
we had made among them. We told two and thirty bodies upon 
the ground, whereof two were not quite dead. Some had an 
arm, and some a leg, shot off; and one his head. Those that 
were not mortally wounded, we supposed they had carried away. 
When we had made, as I thought, a full discovery of all we 
could come at the knowledge of, I was resolved for going on 
board ; but the boatswain and his party sent me word, that 
they were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where 
these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go 
along with them ; and if they could find them, as still they fan- 
cied they should, they did not doubt getting a good booty ; and 
it might be, they might find Tom Jeffrys there (the man we had 
lost). 

Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I should have com- 
manded them instantly on board, knowmg it was not a hazard 
fit for us to run, who had a ship and ship-loading in our charge, 
and a voyage to make, which depended very much upon the 
lives of the men; but as they sent me word they were resolved 
to go, and only asked me and my company to go along with 
tliera, I positively refused it, and rose up in order to return to the 
boat. One or two of the men began to importune me to go ; 
and when I refused positively, began to grumble, and say they 
were not under my command, and they would go. " Come, 
Jack,'' says one of the men, " will you go with me ? I will go 
for one." Jack said he would ; and another followed ; and then 
another ; and, in a word, they all left me but one, whom I per- 
suaded to stay ; so the supercargo and I, with the third man, 
went back to the boat, where we told them we would stav for 
them, and be ready to take in as many of them as should be 
left ; for it was a mad thing they were going about, and we sup- 
posed most of them would run the fate of Tom Jeffrys. 

c c t2 . 



294 LIFE AND ADVENTUHE8 PT. II. 

Well, they all went away ; and though the attempt was des- 
perate, and such as none but madmen would have gone about, 
yet, to give them their due, they went about it as warily as 
boldly. It is true they were gallantly armed, for they had every 
man a fusee, or musket, a bayonet, and a pistol ; some of tliem 
had broad cutlasses, some of them hangers ; and the boatswain, 
and two more, had pole-axes : besides all which, they had among 
them thirteen hand-grenades. Bolder fellows, and better pro- 
vided, never went about any wicked work in the world. 

When they went out, their chief design was plunder ; and 
they were in great hopes of finding gold there; but a circum- 
stance, which none of them wore aware of, set them on fire 
with revengre, and made demons of them all. When they came 
to the few Indian houses, which they thought had been the town, 
which was not above half a mile oflP, they were under a great 
disappointment ; for there were not above twelve or thirteen 
houses ; and where the town was, or how big, they knew not. 
They consulted therefore what to do, and were some time before 
they could resolve : for if they fell upon these, they must cut 
all their throats ; and it was ten to one but some of them might 
escape, it being in the night, though the moon was up ; and if one 
escaped, he would run away, and raise all the town, and so they 
should have a whole army upon them. Again, on the other 
hand, if they went away, and left those untouched (for the 
people were all asleep) they could not tell which way to look 
for the town. 

However, the last was the best advice ; so they resolved to 
leave them, and look for the town as well as they could. They 
went on a little way, and found a cow tied to a tree ; this they 
presently concluded would be a good guide to them ; for they 
said the cow certainly belonged to the town before them, or the 
town behind them ; and if they untied her, they should see which 
way she went : if she went back, they had nothing to say to her; 
but if she went forward, they had nothing to do but to follow 
her. So they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and 
the cow went on before them. In a word, the cow led them 
directly to the town, which, as they reported, consisted of above 
200 houses, or huts ; and in some of these there were several 
families living together. 

Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep 
and a country that had never seen an enemy of that kind could 
make them. And first they called another council, to consider 
what they had to do; and, in a word, they resolved to divide 
themselves into three bodies, and to set three houses on fire in 
three parts of the town ; and as the men came out, to seize and 
bind them, (if any resisted, they need not be asked what to do 
then,) and so to seanh the rest of the houses for plunder. But 
they resolved first to march silently through the town, and see 



CH. lY. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 295 

"what dimensions it was of^ and if they might venture upon it 
or not. 

They did so, and desperately resolved that they would ven- 
ture upon them. But while they were animating one another to 
the work, three of them, that were a little before the rest, called 
out aloud, and told them they had found Tom Jeffrys. They all 
ran up to the place ; and so it was indeed, for there they found 
the poor fellow hanged up naked by one arm, and his throat 
cut. There was an Indian house just by the tree, where they 
discovered sixteen or seventeen of the principal Indians, who 
had been concerned in the fray with us before, and two or three 
of them wounded with our shot ; and our men found they were 
awake, and talking one to another in that house^ but knew not 
their number. 

The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, 
that they swore to one another they would be revenged, and 
that not an Indian that came into their hands should have any 
quarter. And to work they went immediately ; and yet not 
so madly as by the rage and fury they were in might be ex- 
pected. Their first care was to get something that would soon 
take fire ; but after a little search, they found that would be to 
no purpose; for most of the houses were low, and thatched with 
flags or rushes, of which the country is full ; so they presently 
made some wild-fire, as we call it, by wetting a little powder in 
the palms of their hands ; and in a quarter of an hour they set the 
town on fire in four or five places ; and particularly that house 
where the Indians were not gone to bed. As soon as the fire, 
began to blaze, the poor creatures rushed out to save their 
lives; but met with their fate in the^attempt, and especially at 
the door, where they drove them back, the boatswain himself 
killing one or two with his pole-axe. The house being large, and 
many in it, he did not care to go in, but called for a hand-gren- 
ade, and threw it among them, which at first frightened them ; 
but when it burst, made such havoc among them, that they cried 
out in a hideous manner. 

In short, most of the Indians who were in the open part of the 
house were killed or hurt with the grenade, except two or three 
more, who pressed to the door, which the boatswain and two 
more kept, with the bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces, and 
despatched all that came that way. But there was another apart- 
ment in the house, where the prince, or king, and several others, 
were ; and these they kept in, till the house, which was by this 
time all of a light fiame, fell in upon them, and they were all 
smothered or burnt together. 

All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not 
waken the people faster than they could master them ; but the 
fire began to waken them fast enough, and our fellows were glad 
to keep a little together in bodies j for the fire grew so ragm^^^ 



296 LIFE AND ADVENTUBE8 PT. II, 

all the houses being made of light combustible stuff, that they 
could hardly bear the heat between them ; and their business 
was to follow the fire for the surer execution. As fast as the fire 
either forced the people out of those houses which were burning, 
or frightened them out of others, our people were ready at their 
doors to knock them on the head, still csdling and hallooing to 
one another to remember Tom Jeffrys. 

While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and 
especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being 
night, seemed to be just by me. 

My nephew too, who was roused by his men, seeing such 
a fire, was very uncomfortable, not knowing what the matter 
was, or what danger I was in ; especially hearing the guns ; for 
by this time they began to use their fire-arms. A thousand 
thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the supercargo, 
as to what would become of us ; and at last, though he could ill 
spare any more men, yet, not knowing what exigence we might 
be in, he took another boat, and with thirteen men came on shore 
to me. 

He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat, 
with no more than two men ; and though he was glad that we 
were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know 
what was doing; for the noise continued, and the flames increased. 
In short it was next to an impossibility for any men in the world 
to restrain their curiosity to know what had happened, or their 
concern for the safety of the men. In a word, the captain told 
me he would go and help his men, let what would come. I 
argued with him, as I did before with the men, and told him 
I would go, and the two men, and only see if we could at a dis- 
tance learn what was like to be the event, and come back and 
tell him. 

It was all one to talk to my nephew as it was to talk to the 
rest before ; he would go, he said, and he only wished he had 
left but ten men in the ship ; for he could not think of having 
his men lost for want of help : he would rather lose the ship, 
the voyage, and his life and all. And away went he. 

In a word, I was no more able to stay behind now than I was 
to persuade them not to go ; so, in short, the captain ordered two 
men to row back the pinnace, and fetch twelve men more, leaving 
the long-boat at an anchor ; and that when they came back, six 
men should keep the two boats, and six more come after us. So 
that he left only sixteen men in the ship ; for the whole ship's 
company consisted of sixty-five men, whereof two were lost in 
the late quarrel which brought this mischief on. 

Being now on the march, you may be sure we felt little of 
the ground we trod on ; and being guided by the fire, we kept 
no path, but went directly to the place of the conflagration. If 
the noise of the guns was surprising to us before, the cries of the 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 297 

poor people were now of quite another nature, and filled us with 
horror. 

However, we went on, and at length came to the town, though 
there was no entering the streets of it for the fire. The first ob- 
ject we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or rather the 
ashes of it, for the house was consumed ; and just before it, plain 
now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men and three 
women killed ; and, as we thought, one or two more lay in the 
heap among the fire. In short, there were such instances of a 
rage altogether barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what 
was human, that we thought it impossible our men could be 
guilty of it ; or if they were the authors of it, we thought they 
ought to be every one of them put to the worst of deaths. But 
this was not all ; we saw the fire increased forward, and the cry 
went on, just as the fire went on; so that we were in the utmost 
confusion. We advanced a little way farther; and beheld, to our 
astonishment, three women crying in a most dreadful manner, 
come flying) as if they had indeed had wings, and after them 
sixteen or seventeen men, natives, in the same terror and con- 
sternation, with three of our English butchers (for I can call them 
Tjo better) in their rear ; who, when they could not overtake 
them, fired in among them, and one that was killed by their shot 
fell down in our sight. When the rest saw us, believing us to be 
their enemies, and that we would murder them, as well as those 
that pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially 
the women; and two of them fell down as if already dead with 
the fright. 

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in 
my veins, when I saw this ; and I believe, had the three English 
sailors that pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them 
all. However, we took some ways to let the poor flying crea- 
tures know that we would not hurt them ; and immediately they 
came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands lifted up, 
made piteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let them 
know we would : whereupon they crept all together in a huddle, 
close behind us, as for protection. I left my men drawn up to- 
gether, and charged them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get 
at some of our people, and see what devil it was possessed them, 
and what they intended to do ; and, in a word, to command the^m 
off* ; assuring them, that if they stayed till day-light, they would 
have a hundred thousand men about their ears ; I say, I left them, 
and went among those flying people, taking only two of our men 
with me. And there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among them. 
Some of them had their feet terribly burnt with trampling and 
running through the fire ; others their hands burnt ; one of 
the women had fallen down in the fire, and was very much 
burnt before she could get out again ; two or three of the men 
had cuts in their backs and thighs, from pur men pursuing v 



298 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

and another was shot through the body, and died "while I was 
there. 

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was, 
but I could not understand one word they said, thoueh by si^ns 
I perceived that some of them knew not what was the occasion 
themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous 
attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to my own 
men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town through the 
fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an end to it, cost 
what it would. Accordingly, as soon as I came back to my men, 
I told them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me; 
when in the very moment came four of our men, with the boat- 
swain at their head, roving over the heaps of bodies they had 
killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted more 
people to massacre. Our party hallooed to them as loud as they 
could halloo ; and with much ndo, one of them made them hear; 
so that they knew who we were, and came up to us. 

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a 
shout of triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come ; 
and without waiting to hear me, " Captain," says he, *' noble 
captain, I am glad you are come; we have not naif done yet 
Villanous dogs ! I will kill as many of them as poor Tom has 
hairs upon his head. We have sworn to spare none of tbem ; we 
will root out the very nation of them from the earth !" and thus 
he ran on, out of breath too with action, and would not give as 
leave to speak a word. 

At last, raising my voice that I might silence him a little, 
*' Barbarous dog !" said I, " what are you doing ? I will not have 
one creature touched more, upon pain of death. I charge you, 
upon your life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you 
are a dead man this minute." 

" Why, sir," says he, " do you know what you do, or what 
they have done ? If you want a reason for what we have done, 
come hither ;" and with that he shewed me the poor fellow hang- 
ing upon a tree, with his throat cut. 

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time should 
have been forward enough ; but 1 thought they had carried their 
rage too far, and thought of Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and 
Levi, " Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce ; and their wrath, 
for it was cruel.'' But I had now a new task upon my hands; 
for when the men I carried with me saw the sight, as I had done, 
I had as much to do to restrain them as I should have had with 
the other; nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told 
me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of tiie 
men being overpowered ; for, as to the people, he thought not 
one of them ought to live ; for they had all glutted themselves 
with the murder of the poor man, and that they ought to be used 
like murderers. Upon these words, away ran eight of my men 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB, 299 

with the boatswain and his crew, to complete their bloody work. 
And I, seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them, came 
away pensive and sad ; for I could not bear the sight, much less 
the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into 
their hands. 

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and 
two men, and with these I walked back to the boats. It was a 
very great piece of folly in me, I confess, to venture back as it 
were alone ; for as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm 
had run over the country, there stood about forty men, armed 
with lances and bows, at the little place where the twelve or thir- 
teen houses stood, mentioned before ; but by accident I missed 
the place, and came directly to the sea-side ; and by the time I 
got to the sea-side, it was broad day. Immediately I took the 
pinnace, and went aboard, and sent her back to assist the men in 
what might happen. 

By the time the men got to the shore with the pinnace, our 
men began to appear. They came dropping in, some and some ; 
not in two bodies and in form, as they went, but all in heaps, 
straggling here and there in such a manner that a small force 
of resolute men might have cut them all off. 

But the dread of them was upon the whole country. And 
the natives were amazed and surprised, and so frightened, that, 
I believe, a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but 
iive of our men. Nor in all this terrible action was there a man 
that made any considerable defence; they were so surprised 
between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of our men 
in the dark, that they knew not which way to turn themselves ; 
for if they fled one way, they were met by one party, if back 
again, by another ; so that they were every where knocked down. 
Mor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one that 
strained his foot, and another that had one of his hands burnt. 

I was very angry with my nephew the captain, and indeed 
with all the men, but with him in particular, as well for his 
ncting so out of his duty, as commander of the ship, and having 
the charge of the voyage upon him, as in his prompting, rather 
til an cooling, the rage of his men in so bloody and cruel an 
enterprise. My nephew answered me very respectfully ; but 
told me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman whom 
they had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous manner, he 
was not master of himself, neither could he govern his passion. 
He owned he should not have done so, as he was commander of 
the ship ; but as he was a man, and nature moved him, he could 
not bear it. As for the rest of the men, they were not subject 
to me at all, and they knew it well enough ; so they took no 
notice of my dislike. 

The next day we set sail ; so we never heard any more of it. 
Our men differed in the account of the number they killed j some 



300 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. 11. 

6aid one thing, some another. But according to the best of their 
accounts put together, they killed or destroyed about a hundred 
and fifty people, men, women, and children, and left not a house 
standing m the town. 

However just our men thought this action, I was against 
them in it ; and I always, after that time, told them God would 
blast the voyage ; for I looked upon all the blood they shed that 
niffht to be murder in them. For though it is true that they had 
killed Tom Jeffrys, yet it was as true that Jeffrys was the aggres- 
sor, had broken the truce, and had ill-treated a young woman 
of theirs who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of 
their public capitulation. * 

We were now bound to the gulf of Persia, and from thence 
to the coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat ; but the 
chief of the supercargo's design lay at the bay of Bengal, where 
if he missed of his business outward-bound, be was to go up to 
China, and return to the coast as he came home. 

The first disaster that befell us was in the gulf of Persia, where 
five of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the 
gulf, were surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed or 
carried away into slavery ; the rest of the boat's crew were not 
able to rescue them, and had but just time to get off their boat. 
I began to upbraid them with the just retribution of Heaven in 
this case ; but the boatswain very warmly told me that none of 
those five men who were now lost were of the number of those 
who went on shore to the massacre of Madagascar (so I always 
called it, though our men could not bear the word " massacre" 
with any patience): and indeed this circumstance put me to 
silence for the present. 

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject bad worse 
consequences than I expected ; and the boatswain, who had been 
the head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and 
told me he found that I continually brought that afiair upon the 
stage ; that I made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the 
men very ill on that account, and himself in particular ; that as 
I was but a passenger, and had no command in the ship, or con- 
cern in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it ; that they 
did not know but I might have some ill design in my head, and 
perhaps would call them to an account for it when they came 
to England ; and that therefore unless I would resolve to have 
done with it, and also not to concern myself any farther with 
him or any of his affairs, he would leave the ship, for he did not 
think it was safe to sail with me among them. 

I heard him patiently enough till he had done; and then told 
him that I did confess tnat I had all along opposed the massacre 
of Madagascar, for such I would always call it, and that I had on 
all occasions spoken my mind freely about it, though not more 
of him than of any of the rest. That as to my hay mg no com- 



CH. IV. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 801 

mand in the ship, that was true, nor did I exercise any autho- 
rity, but only took my liberty of speaking my mind in things 
which publicly concerned us all ; and what concern I had in the 
voyage, that was none of his business ; that I was a considerable 
owner of the ship, and in that claim I conceived I had a right 
to speak, even rarther than I had yet done, and would not be 
accountable to him or any one else; and began to be a little 
warm with him. He made but little reply to me at that time, 
and I thought that affair had been over. We were at this time 
in the road to Bengal ; and bein^ willing to see the place, I went 
on shore with the supercargo, m the ship's boat to divert my- 
self, and towards evening was preparing to go on board, when 
one of the men came to me, and told me he would not have me 
trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they had orders 
not to carry me on board any more. Any one may guess what 
a surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the 
man who bade him deliver that errand to me ? He told me the 
cockswain. I said no more to the fellow, but bade him let them 
know he had delivered his message, and that I had given him 
no answer to it. 

I immediately went and found out the supercargo, and told 
him the story, adding (what I presently foresaw, viz.) that there 
would certamly be a mutiny in the ship, and entreated him to 
go immediately on board the ship in an Indian boat, and ac- 
quaint the captain of it. But I might have spared this intelli- 
gence ; for, before I had spoken to him on shore, the matter was 
effected on board. The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, 
and, in a word, all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone off 
in the boat, came up to the quarter-deck, and desired to speak 
with the captain ; and there the boatswain making a long ha- 
rangue (for the fellow talked very well), and repeating all he 
had said to me, told the captain in few words, that as I was now 
gone peaceably on shore, they were loath to use any violence 
with me, which, if I had not gone on shore, they would other- 
wise have done, to oblige me to have gone. They therefore 
thought fit to tell him, that as they shipped themselves to serve 
in the ship under his command, they would perform it well and 
faithfully ; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige 
me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no farther 
with him : and at that word "all," he turned his face about to- 
wards the main-mast, which was, it seems, the signal agreed on 
between them, at which all the seamen being got together there, 
cried out, ** One and all, One and all!" 

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great 
presence of mind ; and though he was surprised, yet he told them 
calmly he would consider of the thing, but that he could do 
nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it. He used some 
arguments with them> to shew them the mireasonableness and 

D D 



o02 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

injustice of their conduct ; but it was all in vain ; they swore and 
shook hands round, before his face, that they would go all on 
shore, unless he would ensage to them not to suffer me to come 
any more on board the ship. 

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation 
to me, and did not know how I might take it. So be began to 
talk cavalierly to them ; told them that I was a very considerable 
owner of the ship, and that in justice he could not put me out 
of my own house ; that let them ^o into what ship tiiey would, 
if ever they came to England again it would cost them dear ; 
that the ship was mine, and that he could not put me out of it ; 
and that he would rather lose the ship and the voyage too than 
disoblige me so much ; so they might do as they pleased. How- 
ever he would go on shore and tolk with me ; and invited the 
boatswain to go with him^ and perhaps they might accommodate 
the matter with me. 

But they all rejected the proposal, and said they would have 
nothing to do with me any more, either on board or on shore, 
and if I came on board, they would all go on shore. ** Well," 
said the captain, ^^ if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore 
and talk with him." So away he came to me with this account, 
a little after the message had been brought to me from the cock- 
swain. 

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess ; for I 
was not without apprehensions that they would confine him by 
violence, set sail and run away with the ship ; and then I bad 
been stripped naked, in a remote country, and nothing to help 
myself ; m short I had been in a worse case than when I was 
ali alone in the island. 

But they had not come that length, it seems, to my great 
satisfaction ; and when my nephew told me what they had said 
to him, and how they had sworn and shook hands that they 
would one and all leave the ship if I was suffered to come on 
board, I told him he should not be concerned at it at all, for 1 
would stay on shore ; I only desired he would take care and 
send me all my necessary things on shore, and leave me a suffi- 
cient sum of money, and I would find my way to England as 
well as I could. 

This was a heavy piece of news to my nephew ; but there was 
no way to help it but to comply with it. So, in short, he went 
on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had 
yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his goods from on 
board the ship. So the matter was over in a very few hours, the 
men returned to their duty, and I began to consider what course 
I should steer. 

I was now alone in the remotest part of the world ; for I was 
near three thousand leagues by sea farther off from England than 
I was at my island ; only^ it is true, I might travel here by land 



CH. IV. OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 303 

over the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might go from thence 
to Bassora by sea up the gulf of Persia, and from thence might 
take the way of the caravans over the desert of Arabia to Aleppo 
and Scanderoon ; from thence by sea again to Italy, and so over- 
land into France. And this put together might be, at least, a full 
diameter of the globe ; but if it were to be measured, I suppose 
it would appear to be a great deal more. 

I had another way before me, which was to wait for some 
English ships which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the 
island of Sumatra, and get a passage on board them for England. 

My nephew left me two servants, or rather one companion 
and one servant ; the first was clerk to the purser whom he en- 
gaged to go with me, and the other was his own servant. I took 
me also a good lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, where 
several merchants lodged, some French, two Italians or rather 
Jews, and one Englishman. Here I was handsomely enough 
entertained; and, that I might not be thought to run rashly 
upon any thing, I stayed above nine months, considering what 
course to take and how to manage myself. I had some English 
goods with me of value, and a considerable sum of money ; my 
nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a 
letter of credit for more if I had occasion, that I might not be 
straitened whatever might happen. 

I quickly and advantageously disposed of my goods ; and, as 
I originally intended, bought here some very good diamonds, 
which, of all other things, were the most proper for me in my 
present circumstances, because I might always carry my whole 
estate about me. 

After a long stay here, and many proposals made for my re- 
turn to England, but none falling out to my mind, the English 
merchant who lodged with me, and with whom I had contracted 
an intimate acquaintance, came to me one morning : " Country- 
man,'* says he, " I have a project to communicate to you which, 
as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with 
yours also when you shall have thoroughly considered it. 

" Here we are posted," he continued, " you by accident and 
I by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from our 
own country ; but it is in a country where, by us who understand 
trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got. If vou 
will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire 
a ship here, the first we can get to our minds ; you shall be cap- 
tain, I will be merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to 
China. P'or what should we stand still for? The whole world is 
in motion, rolling round and round ; all the creatures of God, 
heavenly bodies and earthly, are busy and diligent : why should 
wo be idle ? There are no drones in the world but men : why 
should we be of that number?" 

I liked his proposal very well; and the more because it 



304 ADTBNTDKES OF BOBIKSOH CKUSOB. PT. IL 

seemed to be expressed with so much good-will, and in no 
friendly a manner. It was, however, Bome time before we could 
get a ship to our niixls ; and when we got a vessel, it was not 
easy to get bo many English sailors as were necessary to govern 
the voyage, and manage the sailors ne should pick up. After 
some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunaer, English ; 
a Dutch carpenter, and three Portuguese foremast-men. With 
these we found we could do well enongh, having Indian seamen, 
SDch as they were, to make up. 




'' and travels this way, that it would be veiy 
little divereion to any body to give a long 
account of the places we went to, and the 
pie who inhabit there. It is enough 
me to tell you that I made thi» voy- 
\ to Aehin, in the island of Sumatra, 
om thence to Siani, where we ex- 
changed some of our wares for opium and 
j tome arrack ; the first, a commodity which 
bears a great price among the Chinese, and 
which at that time was in great request 
among them. 

In short, we made a very good voyage, 
and I got so much money, and such an in- 
sight into the method of getting more, that had I been twenty 
years younger, I should have been tempted to have stayed here, 
and sought no farther for making my fortune. But what was nil 
this to a man on the wrong side of threescore, that was rich 
enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a restless desire 
of seeing the world, than a covetous desire of gaining by it? I 
was rich enough, nor had I any uneasy desires about getting more 
money ; and therefore tho profits of the voyaKe to me were thinga 
of no great force for the promjiting me forward to further under- 
takings, and I thought that by this voyage 1 had made no pro- 



306 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

gress at all, because I was come back, as I migbt call it, to the 
place from whence I came, as to a home; whereas my eye, which, 
like that which Solomon speaks of, was " never satisfied with 
seeing,'' was still more desirous of wandering and seeing. I was 
come into a part of the world which I was never in before, and 
that part in particular which I had heard much of, and was re- 
solved to see as much of as I could ; and then I thought I might 
say, I had seen all the world that was worth beholding. 

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions. His was 
the more just, and the more suited to the end of a merchant's life. 
He kept himself to the nature of the thing, and would have been 
content to have gone, like a carrier's horse, always to the same 
inn, backward and forward, provided he could, as he called it, 
^' find his account in it." On the other hand, mine was the 
notion of a heedless rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing 
twice over. 

But this was not all. I had a kind of impatience upon me to 
be nearer home, and yet the most unsettled resolution imagin- 
able which way to go. In the interval of these consultations my 
friend, who was always upon the search for business, proposed 
another voyage to me among the Spice Islands, and to bring 
home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts. We 
were not long in preparing for this voyage : the chief difficulty 
was in bringing me to come in to it. However, at last, nothing 
else offering, and finding that stirring about and trading, the 
profit being so great, and, as I may say, certain, had more plea- 
sure in it and more satisfaction to the mind than sitting still, I 
resolved on this voyage too ; which we made very successfully, 
touching at Borneo, and several islands whose names I do not 
remember, and came home in about five months. We sold our 
spice, which was chiefly cloves and some nutmegs, to the Persian 
merchants, who carried them away for the gulf; and making 
near five of one, we really got a great deal of* money. 

My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me. 
" Well, now," said he, playing upon my indolent temper, " is 
not this better than walking about here like a man of nothing to 
do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense and igno- 
rance of the Pagans ?" ** Why, truly," replied I, ** my friend, I 
think it is ; and I begin to be a convert to the principles of mer- 
chandising. But I must tell you, by the way, you do not know 
what you are doing ; for if once I conquer my backwardness, and 
embark heartily, as old as I am, I shall harass you up and down 
the world till I tire you ; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall 
never let you lie still." 

But to be short with my speculations : a little while after this 
there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia ; she was a coaster, and 
of about two hundred tons burthen ; the men, as they pretended,

to sea with, be lay-by at Bengal ; and having, it seems, ^ot money 
enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go for Europe, he 
gave public notice that be would sell bis ship. This came to my 
ears before my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind 
to buy it. So I went and told him of it: he considered a while, 
but at last replied, " She is a little too big ; but, however, we 
will have her/' Accordingly we bought the ship ; and agreeing 
with the master, we paid for her, and took possession. AVhen we 
had done so, we resolved to entertain the men, if we could, to join 
them with those we bad, for the pursuing our business ; but on a 
sudden, they having received not their wages^ but their share of 
the money, not one of them was to be found. We inquired much 
about them, and at length were told that tiiey were all gone to- 
gether by land to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence ; 
and from thence were to travel to Surat, and so by sea to the gulf 
of Persia. 

Nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while, as that I 
missed the opportunity of going with them ; for such a ramble I 
thought, and m such company as would both have guarded me 
and diverted me, would have suited mightily with my great de- 
sign, and I should both have seen the world and gone homewards 
too. But I was much better satisfied a few days after, when I 
came to know what sort of fellows they were ; for, in short, their 
history was, that this man they called captain was the gunner 
only, not the commander ; that they had been a trading Toyage, 
in which they were attacked on shore b^ some of the Malaccans, 
who had killed the captain and three oi his men ; and that after 
the captain was killed, these men, eleven in number, had resolved 
to run away with the ship, which they did, and had brought her 
in at the bay of Ben sal, leaving the mate and ^ye men more on 
fihore ; of whom we shall hear farther. 

Well, let them come by the ship how they would, we came 
honestly by her, as we thought ; though we did not, I confess, 
search into things so exactly as we ougnt ; for we never inquired 
any thing of the seamen, who, if we had examined them, would 
certainly have faltered in their account, contradicted one another, 
and, perhaps, have contradicted themselves; or, one how or 
other, we should have seen reason to have suspected them. But 
the man shewed us a bill of sale for the ship to one Emanuel 
Clostershoven, or some such name (for I suppose it was all a 
forgery), and called himself by that name, and we could not con- 
tradict him ; and being withal a little too unwary, or, at least, 
having no suspicion of the thing, we completed the bargain. 

We picked up some more English seamen here after this, and 
some Dutch ; and now we resolved on a second voyage to the 
south-east for cloves, &c., that is to say, among the Philippine 
and Molucca isles ; and, in short, not to ^11 this part of my story 
with trifles, when what is yet to come is so remarkable, I spent,

from first to last, six years in this country, trading from port to 
port, backward and forward, and with very good success ; and 
was now the last year with my new partner, going in the ship 
above mentioned on a voyage to China, but designing first to go 
to Siam to buy rice. 

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up 
and down a great while in the straits of Malacca and among the 
islands, we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas but we 
found our ship had sprung a leak, and we were not able, by all 
our industry, to find out where it was. This forced us to make 
for some port ; and my partner, who knew the country better 
than I did, directed the captain (for I had made the English 
mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being willing to take the 
charge of the ship upon myself) to put into the river of Cam- 
bodia, which lies on the north side of the great bay or gulf which 
goes up to Siam. 

While we were here, and going often on shore for refresh- 
ment, there came to me one day an Englishman, a gunner's mate 
on board an English East India ship which rode in the same 
river, near the city of Cambodia. ** Sir," said he, ** you are a 
stranger to me, and I to you ; but I have something to tell yoa 
that very nearly concerns you." 

I looked steadily at him a good while, and thought at first I 
had known him, but did not. " If it very nearly concerns me," 
said I, " and not yourself, what moves you to tell it me?" " I 
am moved," says he, " by the imminent danger you are in, and, 
for aught I see, you have no knowledge of it." *^ I know no 
danger I am in," said I, " but that my ship is leaky, and I 
cannot find it out ; but I purpose to lay her aground to-morrow 
to see if I can find it." " But, sir," says he, " leaky or not 
leaky, find it or not find it, you will be wiser than to lay your 
ship on shore to-morrow, when you hear what I have to say to 
you. Do you know, sir, the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen 
leagues up this river ? And there are two large English ships 
about five leagues on this side, and three Dutch." " Well," said 
I, " and what is that to me ?" " Why, sir," says he, *' is it for 
a man that is upon such adventures as you are to come into & 
port, and not examine first what ships there are there, and 
whether he is able to deal with them ? I suppose you do not 
think you are a match for them ?" I was amused very much at 
his discourse, but not amazed at it, for 1 could not conceive what 
he meant ; and I turned short upon him, and said, ^< Sir, I wish 
you would explain yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I 
have to be afraid of any Company's ships or Dutch ships ; I am 
no interloper ; what can they have to say to me ?" 

He looked like a man half angry, half pleased ; and, pausinty j 
awhile, but smiling, said, "Well, sir, if you think yourselfsecure ' 
you must take your chance ; I am sorry your fate should blind 



CH. V. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. SOU 

you against good advice ; but assure yourself, if you do not put 
to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked by live 
long-boats full of men; and, perhaps, if you are taken, you will 
be hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined after- 
wards. I thought, sir," added he, " I should have met with a 
better reception than this, for doing you a piece of service of such 
importance." " I can never be ungrateful," said I, " for any 
service, or to any man that offers me any kindness ; but it is past 
my comprehension, what they should nave such a design upon 
me for. However, since you say there is no time to be lost, and 
that there is some villanous design in hand against me, I will go 
on board this minute, and put to sea immediately, if my men can 
stop the leak, or if we can float without stopping it. But, sir, 
shall I go away ignorant of the reason of all this? Can you give 
me no farther light into it ?" 

" I can tell you but part of the story, sir," says he ; *' but I 
have a Dutch seaman here with me, and, I believe, I could per- 
suade him to tell you the rest ; but there is scarcely time for it. 
But the short of the story is this, the first part of which, I sup- 
pose, you know well enough ; namely, that you were with this 
ship at Sumatra ; that there your captain was murdered by the 
Malaccans, with three of his men ; and that you, or some of those 
that were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and are 
since turned pirates. This is the sum of the story ; and you will 
all be seized as pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very 
little ceremony ; for you know merchants' ships shew but little 
law to pirates, if they get them into their power." 

** Now you speak plain English," said I, ** and I thank you ; 
and though I know nothing that we have done like what you 
talk of, but am sure that we came honestly and fairly by the 
ship ; yet seeing such work is a-doing, as you say, and that you 
seem to mean honestly, I will be upon my guard." " Nay, sir," 
says he, " do not talk of beine upon your guard ; the best defence 
is to be out of the danger. If you have any regard for your life, 
and the life of all your men, put out to sea without fail at high- 
water ; and as you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone 
too far out bewre they can come down ; for they came away at 
high-water; and as they have twenty miles to come, you get 
nearly two hours of them by the difference of the tide, not reck- 
oning the length of the way ; besides, as they are only boats, and 
not ships, they will not venture to follow you out far to sea, 
especially if it blows." 

*' Well," said I, " you have been very kind in this : what 
shall I do for you to make you amends ?" " Sir," answered he, 
^* you may not be so willing to make me any amends, because 
you may not be convinced of the truth of it. I will make an offer 
to you ; I have nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship 
. , which I came out of England in ; and the Dutchman 



310 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. 11. 

that IS with me has seven months' pay due to him ; if you will 
make good our pay to us, we will go along with jrou. If you find 
nothing more in it, we will desire no more ; but if we do convince 
you that we have saved your lives, and the ship, and the lives of 
all thie men in her, we will leave the rest to you." 

I consented to this readily ; and went immediately on hoard, 
and the two men with me. As soon as I came to the ship's side, 
my partner, who was on board, came on the quarter-deck, and 
called to me with a great deal of joy, " O ho ! O ho ! we have 
stopped the leak ! we have stopped the leak V *' Say you so?" 
said I, ** thank God ; but weigh the anchor, then, immediately." 
** Weigh V says he, " what do you mean by that ? What is the 
matter ?" " Ask no questions," said I, " but all hands to work, 
and weigh without losing a minute." He was surprised ; how- 
ever, he called the captain, who immediately ordered the anchor 
to be got up ; and though the tide was not quite done, yet a little 
land-breeze blowing, we stood out to sea. Then I called him into 
the cabin, and told him the story I had heard ; and we called in 
the men, and they told us the rest of it : but as it took up a great 
deal of time, before we had done a seaman came to the cabin- 
door, and called out to us, that the captain bade him tell us, we 
were chased. 

" Chased V said I, '*by what?" *« By five sloops, or boats," 
said the fellow, " full of men." " Very well," said I, " then 
it is apparent there is something in it." In the next place, I 
ordered all our men to be called up ; and told them, that there 
was a design to seize the ship, and to take us for pirates ; and 
asked them, if they would stand by us and by one another ? The 
men answered, cheerfully, that one and all, they would live and 
die with us. Then I asked the captain, what way he thought best 
for us to manage a fight with them ; for resist them I was re- 
solved we would, and that to the last drop. He said, readily, 
that the way was, to keep them off with our great shot as long as 
we could, and then to fire at them with our small-arms; but when 
neither of these would do any longer, we should retire to our close 
quarters ; perhaps they had not materials to break open our bulk- 
heads, or get in upon us. 

The gunner had, in the mean time, orders to bring two guns 
to bear fore and aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and 
load them with musket-bullets, and small pieces of old iron, and 
what came next to hand. And thus we made ready for fight ; but 
all this while kept out to sea, with wind enough, and could see 
the boats at a distance, being five large long-boats, following us 
with all the sail they could make. 

Two of these boats, which, by our glasses, we could see were 
English, out-sailed the rest, were near two leagues a-head of 
them, and gained upon us considerably ; so that we found they 
would come up with us : upon which we fired a gun without a 



CH. V. OP ROBINSON CRUSOE. 311 

shot, to intimate that they should bring to ; and we put out a 
flag of truce, as a signal for parley ; but they kept crowding after 
us, till they came within shot ; upon this we took in our white 
flag, they having made no answer to it, hung out the red flag, 
and fired at them with a shot. Notwithstanding this, they came 
on till they were near enough for us to call to them with a speaking 
trumpet, which we had on board ; so we called to them, and bade 
them keep off, at their peril. 

It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavoured to come 
under our stern, so as to board us on our quarter. Upon which, 
seeing they were resolute for mischief, and depended upon the 
strength that followed them, I ordered to bring the ship to, so 
that they lay upon our broadside, when immediately we fired 
five guns at them. One of them had been levelled so true, as to 
carry away the stern of the hindermost boat, and bring them to 
the necessity of taking down their sail, and running all to the 
head of the boat to keep her from sinking ; so she lay by, and 
had enough of it ; but seeing the foremost boat crowd on after 
us, we made ready to fire at her in turn. 

While this was doing, one of the three boats that was behind, 
being forwarder than the other two, made up to the boat which 
we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could afterwards see her 
take out the men. We called again to the foremost boat, and 
offered a truce to parley again, and to know what was her busi- 
ness with us ; but had no answer: only she crowded close under 
our stern. Upon this our gunner, who was a very dexterous 
fellow, ran out his two chase-guns, and fired again at her. The 
shot missing, the men in the boat shouted, waved their caps, 
and came on ; but the gunner, getting quickly ready again, fired 
among them the second time ; one shot of which, though it 
missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could 
easily see had done a great deal of mischief among them. But 
we, taking no notice of that, wore the ship again, and brought 
our quarter to bear upon them; and, finng three guns more, 
found the boat was split almost to pieces ; in particular, her 
rudder, and -a piece of her stem, was shot quite away ; so they 
lowered their sail immediately, and were in great disorder. To 
complete their misfortune, our gunner let fly two guns at them 
again ; where he hit them we could not tell, but we found the 
boat was sinking, and some of the men already in the water. 
Upon this I immediately manned out our pinnace, which we had 
kept close by our side, with orders to pick up some of the men, 
if they could, and save them from drowning, and immediately to 
get on board with them ; because we saw the rest of the boats 
began to come up. Our men in the pinnace followed their orders, 
and took up three men ; one of whom was just drowning, and it 
was a good while before we could recover him. As soon as they 
were on board, we crowded all the sail we could make, and stood 



312 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

farther out to sea ; and we found that when the other three boats 
came up to the first two, they gave over their chase. 

Being thus delivered from a danger, which though I knew not 
the reason of it, yet seemed to be much greater than I appre- 
hended, I took care that we should change our course, and not 
let any one imagine whither we were gomg. So we stood oat 
to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European ships, 
whether they were bound to China, or any where else within the 
commerce of the European nations. 

When we were now at sea, we began to consult with the two 
seamen, and inquire first, what the meaning of all this should be? 
And the Dutchman let us into the secret of it at once ; telling as, 
that the fellow that sold us the ship was no more than a thief that 
had run away with her. Then he told us how the captain was 
treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast of Malacca, 
with three of his men ; and that he, this Dutchman, and fear 
more, got into the woods, where they wandered about a great 
while ; till at length, he, in particular, in a miraculous manner, 
made his escape, and swam off to a Dutch ship, which, sailing 
near the shore, in its way to China, had sent their boat on shore 
for fresh water ; that he durst not come to that part of the shore 
where the boat was, but made shift in the night to take the 
water farther off, and the ship's boat took him up. 

He then told us, that he went to Batavia, where two of the 
seamen belonging to the ship arrived, having (deserted the rest 
in their travels ; and gave an account, that the fellow who had 
run away with the ship, sold her at Bengal to a set of pirates, 
which were gone a cruising in her ; and that they had already 
taken an English ship, and two Dutch ships, very richly laden. 

This latter part we found to concern us directly ; and though 
we knew it to be false, yet, as my partner said very well, if we 
had fallen into their hands, and they had had such a preposses- 
sion against us beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have 
defended ourselves, or to hope for any good quarter at their 
hands ; and especially considering that our accusers had been 
our judges, and that we could have expected nothing from them 
but what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion 
have executed : and therefore it was his opinion, we should go 
directly back to Bengal, from whence we came, without putting 
in at any port whatever ; because there we could give a good 
account of ourselves, could prove where we were when the ship 
put in, how we bought her, and the like ; and, which was more 
than all the rest, it' we were put to the necessity of bringing it 
before the proper judges, we should be sure to have some justice; 
and not be hangea first, and judged afterwards. 

I was some time of my partner's opinion ; but after a little 
more serious thinking, I told him, I thought it was a very great 
hazard for us to attempt returning to Bengal^ for that we were 



CH. v. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 313 

on the wrong side of the Straits of Malacca ; and that if the 
alarm was given, we should be sure to be waylaid on every side, 
as well by the Dutch of Batavia as the English elsewhere ; that 
if we should be taken, as it were, running away, we should even 
condemn ourselves, and there would want no more evidence to 
destroy us. I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who said 
he was of my mind, and that we should certainly be taken. 

This danger a little startled my partner, and all the ship's 
company ; and we immediately resolved to go away to the coast 
of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of China ; and pursuing the 
first design as to trade, find some way or other to dispose of the 
ship, and come back in some of the vessels of the country, such 
as we could get. This was approved of as the best method for 
our security ; and accordingly we steered away n.n.e., keep- 
ing above &fty leagues off £om die usual course to the east- 
ward. 

My partner described to me the several ports of that coast ; 
and told nie he would put in on the coast of Cochin China, or 
the bay of Tonquin ; intending to go afterwards to Macao, a 
town once in the possession of the Portuguese, and where still 
a great many European families resided, and particularly the 
missionary priests usually went thither, in order to their going 
forward to China. 

Hither, then, we resolved to go ; and accordingly, though after 
a tedious and irregular course, and very much straitened for 
provisions, we came within sight of the coast very early in the 
morning ; and, upon reflection on the past circumstances we had 
been in, and the danger we had just escaped, we resolved to 
put into a small river, which, however, had depth enough of 
water for us, and to see if we could, either overland, or by the 
ship's pinnace, come to know what ships were in any port there- 
abouts. This happy step was, indeed, our deliverance ; for 
though we did not immediately see any European ships in the 
bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay 
two Dutch ships; and a third, without any colours spread, but 
which we believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two 
leagues distance, steering for the coast of China ; and in the 
afltemoon by went two English ships, steering the same course ; 
and thus, we thought, we saw ourselves beset with enemies both 
one way and the other. The place we were in was wild and bar- 
barous ; the people thieves, even by occupation or profession ; 
and though, it is true, we had not much to seek of them, and, 
except getting a few provisions, cared not how little we had to 
do with them, yet it was with much difficulty that we kept our- 
selves from being insulted by them several ways. 

We were in a small river of this country, within a few leagues 
of its utmost limits northward ; and by our boat we coasted north- 
east to the point of land which opens the great bay of Tonquin ; 

B B 



314 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

and it was in this beating up along the shore, that we discovered 
as above, that, in a word, we were surrounded with enemies. 
The people we were among were the most barbarous of all the 
inhabitants of the coast; having no correspondence with any 
other nation, and dealing only in fish, and oil, and such com- 
modities. Among other customs, they have this ODe^ that if 
any vessels have the misfortune to be shipwrecked upion their 
coast, they presently make the men all prisoners or slaves. And 
it was not long before we found a spice of their kindness in this 
way. 

I have observed above, that our ship sprang a leak at sea, 
and that we could not find it out ; And, however, it happened, 
that it was stopped unexpectedly, in the happy minute of our 
being to be seized by the Dutch and English ships in the bay of 
Siam ; yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly fit and sound 
as we desired, we resolved, while we were in this place, to lay 
her on shore, take out what heavy things we had on board, which 
were not many, and wash and clean her bottom ; so as^ if possi- 
ble, to find out where the leaks were. 

Accordingly, having lightened the ship, and brought all our 
guns, and otiher moveable things, to one side, we tried to bring 
her down, that we might come at her bottom ; but^ on second 
thoughts, we did not care to lay her dry on ground, neither could 
we find out a proper place for it. 

The inhabitants, who had never been acquainted with such a 
sight, came wondering down to the shore to look at us ; and 
seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and 
heeling towards the shore, and not seeing our men^ who were 
at work on her bottom, with stages, and with their boats on the 
ofi'side, they presently concluded that the ship was cast away, 
and lay fast on the ground. 

On this supposition, they came all about us in two or three 
hours' time, with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them 
eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come 
on board and plundered the ship ; and if they found us there, to 
have carried us away for slaves to their kin^, or whatever they 
call him, — ^for we knew nothing who w€W their governor. 

When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, 
they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's 
bottom and side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every 
seafaring man knows how. 

They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a little 
surprised, could not imagine what their design was ; but being 
willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us 
into the ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to 
those that were at work to defend themselves with, if there should 
he occasion. And \t "wa^. wo TaoT^ \Vvmv laaed '^ for, in less than a

CH. v. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 315 

ship was really a wreck ; that we were all at work, endeavouring 
to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats ; and 
when we handed our arms into the boats, they concluded, by that 
motion, that we were endeavouring to save some of our goods. 
Upon this they took it for granted we all belonged to them ; and 
away they came down upon our men, as if it had been in a line 
of battle. 

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened ; 
for we lay but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to 
know what they should do. I immediately called to the men 
who worked upon the stages, to slip them down, and get up the 
side into the ship ; and bade those in the boat to row round and 
come on board. Those few of us who were on board, worked 
with all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to 
rights ; but, however, neither the men upon the stage, nor 
those in the boats, could do as they were ordered, before the 
Cochin Chinese were upon them ; and with two of their boats 
boarded our long-boat, and began to lay hold of the men as their 
prisoners. 

The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a 
stout strong fellow, who, having a musket in his hand, never 
offered to fire it, but laid it down in the boat, — like a fool, as 
I thought. But he understood his business better than I could 
teach him ; for he grappled the pagan, and dragged him by 
main force out of their boat into ours ; where, taking him by 
the two ears, he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel, that 
the fellow died instantly in his hands ; and, in the mean time, 
a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and with the 
butt-end of it, so laid about him, that he knocked down five of 
them who attempted to enter the boat. But this was doing 
little towards resisting thirty or forty men, who, bein^ fearless, 
because ignorant of their danger, began to throw uiem selves 
into the long-boat, where we had but five men in all to defend 
it. One accident, however, gave our men a complete victory, 
which deserved our laughter rather than any thing else; and 
that was this : 

Our carpenter being preparing to grave the outside of the 
ship, as well as to pay the seams where he had caulked her, 
had got two kettles just let down into the boat ; one filled with 
boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and 
such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work ; and the man 
that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, 
with which he supplied the men that were at work with that 
hot stuff. Two of tne enemy's men entered the boat just where 
this fellow stood, being in the fore-sheets ; he immediately 
saluted them with a ladleful of the stuff, boiling hot ; which so 
burnt and scalded them, being halt-naked^ \£».\. ^«^ -c<a»x<&.^

the sea. The carpenter saw it, and cried out, ''Well done. 
Jack ; give them some more of it !" and stepping forward him- 
self, took one of their mops, and dipping it into the pitch-pot, 
he and his man threw it among them so plentifully, that, in 
short, of all the men in the three boats, there was not one that 
was not scalded and burned with it in a most pitiful manner, 
and made such a howling and crying, that I never heard a 
worse noise, and, indeed, nothing like it ; for I never heard anv 
thing more like the noise of the wolves, which, as I have said, 
I heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of Languedoc. 

I was never better pleased with a victory in my life ; not 
only as it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger 
was imminent before, but as we had obtained it without any 
bloodshed, except of that man whom the fellow killed with his 
naked hands, and which I was very much concerned at : for I was 
sick of killing such poor savage wretches, even though it was 
in my own defence, knowing they came on errands which they 
thought just, and knew no better ; and that though it may be a 
just thing, because necessary, (for there is no necessary wicked- 
ness in nature,) yet I thought it was a sad life which we most 
be always obliged to be slaving our fellow-creatures to preserve; 
and, indeed, I think so still ; and I would, even now, suffer a 
great deal, rather than I would take away the life even of that 
person injuring me. And I believe all considering people, who 
know the value of life, would be of my opinion ; at all events, 
if they entered seriously into the consideration of it. 

But to return to my story : all the while this was doing, my 
partner and I, who managed the rest of the men on board, had 
with -great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights ; and, 
having got the guns into their places again, the gunner called 
to me, to bid our boat get out of the way, for he would let fly 
among them. I called back again to him, and bid him not 
offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work without him ; 
but bade him heat another pitch-kettle ; which our cook, who 
was on board, took care of. But the enemy was so terrified 
with what they had met with in their first attack, that they 
would not come on again ; and some of them, that were farthest 
off, seeing the ship swim, as it were, upright, began, as we sup- 
posed, to see their mistake, and gave over the enterprise, finding 
it was not as they expected. Thus we got clear of this fight ; 
and, having gotten some rice, and some roots and bread, with 
about sixteen good big hogs, on board, two days before, we re- 
solved to stay here no longer, but go forward, whatever came 
of it ; for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the 
next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than our pitch- 
kettle would dispose of for us. 

We therefore got all our things on board the same evening, 
and the next morning were ready to sail. In the mean time, 



CH. V. OF ROBINSON CBUSOB. 31 7 

lying at an anchor at some distance, we were not go much con- 
cerned, being now in a fighting as well as in a sailing posture, 
if any enemy had presented. The next day, haying finished 
our work within board, and finding our ship was perfectly cured 
of all her leaks, we set sail. We would have gone into the bay 
of Tonquin, for we wanted to inform ourselves of what was to 
be known concerning the Dutch ships that had been there ; but 
we durst not stand in there, because we had seen several ships 
go in, as we supposed, but a little before ; so we kept on n.e. 
towards the isle of Formosa ; as much afraid of being seen by a 
Dutch or English merchant-ship, as a Dutch or English mer- 
chant-ship in the Mediterranean is of meeting an Algerine man- 
of-war. 

Being now come to the latitude of thirty degrees, we resolved 
to put into the first trading port we should arrive at ; and stand- 
ing in for the shore, a boat came ofi* two leagues to us, with an 
old Portuguese pilot on board, who, knowing us to be an Euro- 
pean ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were very 
glad of, and took him on board. Upon which, without asking 
us whither we would go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and 
sent it back. 

I thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old 
man carry us whither we would, that I began to talk with him 
about carrying us to the gulf of Nanquin, which is the most 
northern part of the coast of China. The old man said he knew 
the gulf of Nanquin very well ; but smiling, asked us what we 
would do there ? I told him we would sell our cargo, and pur- 
chase china wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c. ; 
and so would return by the same course we came. He told us 
our best port had been to have put in at Macao, where we could 
not have failed of a satisfactory market for our opium ; and 
might, for our money, have purchased all sorts of China goods 
as cheap as we could at Nanquin. 

Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he 
was very opiniated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen 
as well as merchants, and that we had a mind to eo and see the 
great city of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch of 
China. " Why, then," says the old man, " you should go to 
Ningpo, where, by the river which runs into the sea there, you 
may go up within five leagues of the great canal. This canal is 
a navigable river, which ^oes through the heart of that vast em- 
pire of China, crosses all the rivers, passes some considerable 
hills by the help of sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of 
Pekin, being in len^h near 270 leagues." 

" Well," said 1, " Signer Portuguese, but that is not our 
business now : the great question is, can you carry us up to 
the city of Nanquin, from whence we can travel to Pekin after- 
wards ?" Yes, he said, he could do so very well 3 and that there 

E e2

was a great Dutch ship gone up that way just before. This gave 
me a little shock. A Dutch ship was now our terror, and we 
depended upon it that a Dutch ship would be our destruction ; 
for we were in no condition to iight them, all the ships thev 
trade with in those parts being of great burthen^ and of mach 
greater force than we were. 

The old man found me a little confused and under some con- 
cern when Ue named a Dutch ship ; and said to me, '' Sir, you 
need be under no apprehension of the Dutch ; I suppose they are 
not now at war with your nation." " No," said I, ** that's true; 
but I know not what liberties men may take when they are out 
of the reach of the laws of their country." ** Why," said he, 
** you are no pirates ; what need you fear? They will not med- 
dle with peaceable merchants, sure." 

If I had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my 
face at that word, it was hindered by some stop in the vessek 
appointed by nature to prevent it ; for it put me into the greatest 
disorder and confusion imaginable, nor was it possible for me to 
conceal it so but that the old man easily perceived it. 

" Sir," said he, " I find you are m some disorder in your 
thoughts at my talk; pray be pleased to go which way yoa 
think fit, and depend upon it I will do you all the service I can." 
" Why, signer," said 1, " it is true 1 am a little unsettled in 
my resolution at this time whither to go in particular, and I am 
something more so for what you said about pirates. I hope 
there are no pirates in these seas ; we are but in an ill condition 
to meet with them ; for, you see, we have but a small force, and 
but very weakly manned." 

" O sir," eaid he, " do not be concerned ; I do not know that 
there have been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years, ex- 
cept one which was seen, as I hear, in the bay of Siam, about a 
month since ; but you may be assured she is gone to the south- 
ward. Nor was she a ship of any great force, or fit for the work; 
she was not built for a privateer, but was run away with by a 
reprobate crew that were on board, after the captain and some of 
his men had been murdered by the Malaccans, at or near the 
island of Sumatra." 

" What 1" said I, seeming to know nothing of the matter, 
" did they murder the captain ?" " No," said he, ** I do not 
understand that they murdered him ; but as they afterwards ran 
away with the ship, it is generally believed they betrayed him 
into the hands of the Malaccans, who did murder him ; and, 
perhaps, they instigated them to do it." '* Why, then," said I, 
** they deserved death as much as if they had done it themselves." 
" Nay," said the old man, " they do deserve it, and they will 
certainly have it if they light upon any £nglit>h or Dutch ship; 
for they have all agreed together, that if they meet that rogue, 
they wUl give him no quarter.' 



CH. y; OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 319 

" But," answered I, " you say the pirate is gone out of these 
seas ; how can they meet with him, then V " Why, that is true," 
said he, '^ they do say so ; but he was, as I tell you, in the bay 
of Siam, in the river Cambodia, and was discovered there by 
some Dutchmen who belonged to the ship, and who were left 
on shore when they ran away with her ; and some English and 
Dutch traders being in the river, they were within a little of 
taking him. Nay, if the foremost boats had been well seconded 
by the rest, they nad certainly done so ; but he, finding only two 
boats within reach of him, tacked about and iired at these two, 
and disabled them before the others came up ; and then standing 
off to sea, the others were not able to follow him, and so he &;ot 
away. But they have all so exact a description of the ship, that 
they will be sure to know him ; and wherever they find him, they 
have vowed to give no quarter to either 'the captain or seamen, 
but to hang them all up at the yard-arm." 

** What !'' said I, " will they execute them right or wrong ; 
hang them first, and judge them afterwards?" '* O sir," said 
the old pilot, ** there is no need of making a formal business of 
it with such rogues as those ; let them tie them back to back and 
set them a diving ; it is no more than they richly deserve." 

I knew I had my old man fast aboard, and that he could do 
me no harm; so I turned short upon him : ** Well, now, signer," 
said I, ** this is the very reason why I would have you carry us 
up to Nanquin, and not to put back to Macao, or to any other 
part of the country, where the English or Dutch ships come ; for 
be it known to you, signor, those captains of the English and 
Dutch 8hi])8 are a parcel of rash, proud, insolent fellows, that 
neither know what belongs to justice, nor how to behave them- 
selves as the laws of God and nature direct ; but being proud 
of their offices, and not understanding their power, they would 
act the murderers to punish robbers, would take upon them to 
insult men falsely accused, and determine them guilty without 
due inquiry ; and, perhaps, I may live to call some of them to 
an account for it, where they may be taught how justice is to 
be executed, and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal 
till some evidence may be had of the crime, and that he is the 



man." 



With this I told him that this was the very ship they attacked, 
and gave him a full account of the i^kirmish we had with their 
boats, and how foolishly and coward-like they behaved. I told 
him all the story of our buying the ship, ami how the Dutchmen 
served us. I told him the reasons I had to believe that this story 
of killing the master by the Malaccans was true, as also the run- 
ning away with the ship; but that it was all a fiction of their 
own to suggest that the men were turned pirates. And thev 
ought to have been sure it was so, before they had ventured to 
attack us by surprise, an4 oblige us to resist them ; adding, that 



320 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

they would have the blood of those men killed there in our just 
defence to answer for. 

The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were 
very much in the right to go away to the north ; and that if he 
might advise us, it should be to sell the ship in China, which we 
might very well do, and buy or build another in the country. 
" And," said he, " though you will not get so good a ship, yet 
you may get one able enough to carry you and all your goods 
back again to Bengal, or any where else." 

I told him I would take his advice, when I came to any port 
where I could find a ship for my turn, or get any customer to 
buy this. He replied, I should meet with customers enough for 
the ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese junk would serve me 
very well to go back again ; and that he would procure me 
people both to buy one and sell the other. 

We now went forward directly for Nanquin, and, in abont 
thirteen days' sail, came to an anchor at the south-west point of 
the great gulf of Nanquin ; where, by the way, I came by acci- 
dent to understand that two Dutch ships were gone that length 
before me, and that I should certainly fall into their hands. I 
consulted my partner again in this exigency, and he was as much 
at a loss as I was, and would very gladly have been safe on shore 
almost any where. However, I was not in such perplexity nei- 
ther, but I asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbour 
which I might put into, and pursue my business with the Chinese 
privately, and be in no danger of the enemy? He told me, if I 
would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues, there 
was a little port called Quinchang, where the fathers of the 
mission usually landed from Macao, on their progress to teach 
the Christian religion to the Chinese, and where no European 
ships ever put in ; and if I thought to put in there, I might con- 
sider what farther course to take when I was on shore. He 
confessed, he said, it was not a place for merchants, except that 
at some certain times they had a kind of a fair there, when the 
merchants from Japan came over thither to buy the Chinese 
merchandises. 

We all agreed to go back to this place, and weighed the next 
day, having only gone twice on shore, where we were to get fresh 
water. On botn these occasions the people of the country were 
very civil to us, and brought us abundance of provisions, as 
plants, roots, tea, rice, and fowls ; but nothing without money. 

We came to the other port (the wind being contrary) not till 
five days ; but it was very much to our satisfaction ; and I was 
joyful, and, 1 may say, thankful, when I set my foot safe on 
shore ; resolving, and my partner too, that if it was possible to 
dispose of ourselves and effects any other way, though not alto- 
gether to our satisfaction, we would never set one foot on board 
that unhappy vessel more. And indeed^ I must acknowledge that, 



CH. v. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3*21 

of all the circumstaDces of life that ever I had any experience of, 
nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being 
in constant fear. It is a life of death ; and the mind is so entirely 
op]}ressed by it, that it is capable of no relief; the animal spirits 
sink, and all the vigour of nature, which usually supports men 
under other afflictions, and is present to them in the greatest 
exi^ncies, fails them here. 

Both my partner and I scarceljr slept a night without dream-* 
ing of halters and gibbets, of fighting and being taken, of killing 
and being killed ; and one night especially I]was in such a fury 
in my dream, fancying the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was 
knocking one of their seamen down, that I struck my double 
list against the side of the cabin I lay in with such a force as 
wounded my hand most grievously, broke my knuckles^ and cut 
and bruised the flesh, so that it not only waked me out of my 
sleep, but I was once afraid I should have lost two of my fingers. 

Another apprehension I had, was^ of the cruel usage we might 
meet with from them, if we fell into their hands; how they 
might, perhaps, torture us ; and make some of our men, by ex- 
tremity of suffering, confess those crimes they never were guilty 
of, — own themselves, and all of us, to be pirates ; and so they 
would put us to death, with a formal appearance of justice ; and 
that they might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship 
and cargo, which was worth four or Inve thousand pounds. 

Whenever these thoughts prevailed, I was sure to put myself 
in a kind of fever, with the agitations of a supposed fight ; my 
blood would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as if I was engaged ; and 
I always resolved that I would take no quarter at their hand ; 
but even at last, if I could resist no longer, I would blow up the 
ship and all that was in her, and leave them but little booty to 
boast of. 

By how much the greater burden the anxieties of these things 
were to our thoughts while we were at sea, by so much the 
greater was our satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore ; 
and my partner told me, he dreamed that he had a very heavy 
load upon his back, which he was to carry up a hill, and found 
that he was not able to stand long under it ; but that the Portu- 
guese pilot came, and took it off his back, and the hill disap- 
peared, the ground before him shewing all smooth and plain. 
And truly it was so ; we were all like men who had a load taken 
off their backs. For my part, I had a weight taken off from 
my heart, that it was not able any longer to bear ; and, as I said 
above, we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship. When we 
came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got us a 
lodging, and a warehouse for our goods, which, by the way, was 
much the same. It was a little house or hut, with a large house 
joining it, all built with canes, and palisadoed round with large 
canes to keep out thieves^ of which, it soems, there were not a 



322 LIFE AND ADVENTTJBES FT. II. 

few in the country. However, the magistrates allowed as also a 
little guard, and we had a sentinel with a kind of halbert, or halt- 
pike, who stood sentinel at our door; so that our goods were 
kept very safe. 

The fair or mart, usually kept in this place, had been over 
some time ; however, we found that there were three or four 
junks in the river, and two ships from Japan, with goods which 
they had bought in China, and were not gone away, having 
some Japanese merchants on shore. 

We began now to be very doubtful what we should do, for we 
were in a place of very little business ; and once I was about to 
venture to sail for the river of Kilam, and the city of Nanquin ; 
but Providence seemed here to begin to clear up our way a 
little ; and the first thing that offered was, that our old Portu- 
guese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who began to in- 
quire what goods we had ; and, in the first place, he bought all 
our opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold 
by weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and some in 
small wedges, of about ten or eleven ounces each. Wbile we 
were dealing with him for our opium, it came into my bead that 
he might perhaps deal with us for the ship too ; and I ordered the 
interpreter to propose it to him. He shrugged up his shoulders 
at it, when it was first proposed to him ; but in a few days after, 
he came to me, with one of the missionary priests for his inter- 
preter, and told me, he had a proposal to make to me, and that 
was this. He had bought a great quantity of goods of us when 
he had no thoughts (or proposals made to him) of buying the 
ship, and that therefore he had not money enough to pay for the 
ship ; but if I would let the same men who were in the ship 
navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan, and would 
send them from thence to the Philippine islands with another 
loading, which he would pay the freight of before they went 
from Japan ; and that, at their return, he would buy the ship. 

The first thing we had to do, before we could consent to thb 
proposal, was to- consult with the captain of the ship, and with 
nis men, and know if they were willing to go to Japan ; and, 
while I was doing this, the young man, who, as I related, my 
nephew had left with me as my companion for my travels, came 
to me and said, that he thought that voyage promised very fair, 
and that there was a great prospect of advantage, and he should 
be very glad if I would undertake it ; but that if I would not, 
and would give him leave, he would go as a merchant, or how I 
pleased to order him ; that if ever he came to England, and I 
was there and alive, he would render me a faithful account of 
his success, and it should be as much mine as I pleased . 

I was really loath to part with him ; but considering the pro- 
spect of advantage, which was really considerable, and that he 
was a young fellow as likely to do well in it as any I knew, I 



CH. V. OF ROBINSON CRTJSOE. 323 

inclined to let him go; but first I told him I would consult 
my partner, and give him an answer the next day. My part- 
ner and I discoursed about it; and the former made a most 
generous offer. " You know/' said he, "it has been an unlucky 
ship, and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again : if your 
steward," so he called my man, " will venture the voyage, I will 
leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best of 
it ; and if we live to meet in England, and he has success abroad^ 
he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship's freight to 
us, and the other shall be his own." 

If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young 
man, made him such an offer, I could do no less than offer him 
the same. And all the ship's company being willing to go with 
him, we made over half the ship to him in property, and took 
a writing from him, obliging him to account for the other ; and 
away he went to Japan. The Japan merchant proved a very 
punctual honest man to him, protected him at Japan, and got 
him license to come on shore ; paid him his freight very punc- 
tually, sent him to the Philippines, loaded with Japan and China 
wares, and a supercargo of their own, who trafiicking with the 
Spaniards brought back European goods again, and a great 
quantity of cloves and other spice ; and there he was not only 
paid his freight very well, and at a very good price, but being 
not willing to sell the sbap then, the merchant furnished him 
with goods on his own account; that, for some money, and 
some spices of his own, which he brought ^with him, he went 
back to the Manillas, to the Spaniards, where he sold his cargo 
very well. Here, having obtained a good acquaintance at Ma- 
nilla, he got his ship made a free ship ; and the governor of 
Manilla hired him to go to Acapulco in America, on the coast 
of Mexico ; and gave him a license to land there, and travel to 
Mexico ; and to pass in any Spanish ship to Europe, with all 
his men. 

He made the voyage to Acapulco very happily, and there 
sold his ship ; and having there also obtained allowance to travel 
by land to Porto Bello, he found means to get to Jamaica with 
all his treasure ; and about eight years after came to England, 
exceedingly rich.

in tlie river of Cambodia. The truth wM.'thej had done lu » 
considerable service, and deserved well at our hands; though, 
by the way, they were a couple of rogues too ; for, as they be- 
lieved the Btory of our beiog pirates, and that we had really run 
away with the ship, they came down to us, not only to betray tfae 
design that was tbrniea against us, but to go to sea with us s) ' 
pirates ; and one of them confessed afterwanis, that nothing elM 
but the hopes of going a roguiug brought him to do it. However, 
3 ibey did us was not the less ; and therefore, i ~ ' 



spective ships ; and over and above that, I gave each of them * 
Bmall sum of money in pold, and which contented them very 
well ; tfaen 1 made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the gun- 
ner being now made second mate and purser ; the Dutchman I 
made boatswain. So they were both very well pleased, and proved 
very serviceable, beine both able seamen and very stout feflows. 
We were now on shore in China. If I thought myaelf ban- 
ished and remote from my own country at Bengal, where I hsJ 
many ways to get home for my money, what could I think of 
inyself now, when I had got aoout a thousand leagues iarther 
off from home, and destitute of all manner of prospect of return? 



CH. VI. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 325 

All we had for it was this, that in about four months' time 
there was to be another fair at the place where we were, and then 
we might be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the 
country, and withal might possibly find some Chinese junk^ or 
vessels from Tonquin, that would be to be sold, and would carry 
us and our goods whither we pleased. This I liked very wejl, 
and resolved to wait ; besides, as our particular persons were not 
obnoxious, so if any English or Dutch ships came thither, per- 
haps we might have an opportunity to load our goods, and get 
passage to some other place in India nearer home. 

Upon these hopes we resolved to continue here ; but, to divert 
ourselves, we took two or three journeys into the country. First, 
we went ten days' journey to see the city of Nanquin ; and a city 
it is well worth seemg indeed ; they say it has a million of people 
in it ; which, however, I do not beheve. It is regularly built, the 
streets all exactly straight, and crossing one another in direct 
lines, which gives the figure of it great advantage. 

On our return from Nanquin, I had a curiosity to see the city 
of Pekin, which I had heard so much of. I referred it to my part- 
ner, and left it wholly to his choice ; who, at length, resolved in 
the afiirmative ; and we prepared for our journey. We set out 
with very good advantage as to finding the way ; for we got leave 
to travel in the retinue of a mandarin, one of the viceroys or 
principal magistrates, and who take ^reat state upon them, tra- 
velling with great attendance, and with much homage from the 
people, who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them, bie- 
cause all the countries they pass through are obliged to furnish 
provisions for them and all their attendants. 

We were five-and-twenty days travelling to Pekin, through a 
country infinitely populous, but'wretchedly cultivated ; the hus- 
bandry, the economy, and the way of living, miserable ; though 
they boast so much of the industry of the people. The pride of 
these people is exceeded by nothing but their poverty, which 
adds to that which I call their misery. And I must needs think 
the naked savages of America live much more happy, because, 
as they have nothing, so they desire nothing ; whereas these are 
proud and insolent, and, in the main, are mere beggars and 
drudges. Their ostentation is inexpressible, and is chiefly shewn 
in their clothes and buildings, and in the keeping multitudes of 
servants or slaves, and, which is to the last degree ridiculous, their 
contempt of all the world but themselves. 

I must confess, I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the 
deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here ; and 
yet the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very con- 
venient for travellers. But nothing was more awkward to me, 
than to see such a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the 
midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance ; for all their 
famed ingenuity is no more. And I used to be very merry upon 

F F 



226 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

these occasions, to see the beggarly pride of these people. For 
example, coming by the house of a country gentleman, as he was 
called, about ten leagues from the city of Nanquin, we had, first 
of all, the honour to ride with the master of the house about two 
miles ; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being 
a mixture of pomp and poverty. 

The habit of this greasy Don was very proper for a scara- 
mouch or merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with all the taw- 
dry and trapping of a fooPs coat, such as hanging sleeves, tas- 
sels, and cuts and slashes almost on every side ; it covered a 
taffety vest as greasy as a butcher's, and which testified that bis 
honour must needs be a most exquisite sloven. 

His horse was a poor, lean, starved, hobbling creature, such 
as in England might sell for about thirty or forty shillings ; and 
he had two slaves following him on foot, to drive the poor crea- 
ture along : he had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the 
beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail. And 
thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve servants ; and we 
were told he was going from the city to his country seat, about 
half a league before us. We travelled on gently, but this figure 
of a gentleman rode away before us ; and as we stopped at a 
village about an hour to refresh us, when we came by the country 
seat of this sreat man, we saw him in a little place before his 
door, eating his repast ; it was a kind of garden, but he was easy 
to be seen ; and we were given to understand, that the more we 
looked on him, the better he would be pleased. 

He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto-tree, which 
effectually shaded him over the head and on the south side ; but 
under the tree also was placed a large umbrella, which made that 
part look well enough. He sat lolling back in a great elbow- 
chair, being a heavy corpulent man, and his meat being brought 
him by two women slaves; he had two more, whose office, I 
think, few gentlemen in Europe would accept of their service in ; 
namely, one fed the squire with a spoon, and the other held the 
dish with one hand, and scraped off what he let fall upon his wor- 
ship's beard and taffety vest; while his fat master thought it 
below him to employ his own hands in any of those familiar offices 
which kings and monarchs would rather do than be troubled with 
the clumsy assistance of their servants. 

As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was re- 
spected like a king ; surrounded always with his sentlemen, and 
attended in all his appearances with such pomp, that 1 saw little 
of him but at a distsince : but this I observed, that there was not 
a horse in his retinue but that our carriers' pack-horses in Eng- 
land seemed to me to look much better ; but they were so covered 
with equipage, mantles, and trappings, we could see scarcely any 
thin^ of them but their feet and their heads. 

I was now light-hearted, and all my trouble smd perplexity

that I have given an account of being over^ I had no anxious 
thoughts about me, which made this journey the pleasanter; nor 
did SLuy ill accident attend me, only in the passing or fording a 
small river, my horse fell, and made me free of the country, as 
they call it; that is to say, threw me in. The place was not 
deep, but it wetted me all over. 

At length we arrived at Pekin. I had nobody with me but 
the youth, whom my nephew the captain had given me to attend 
me as a servant, and who proved very trusty and diligent ; and 
my partner had nobody with him but one servant, who was a 
' kinsman. As for the Portuguese pilot, he being desirous to see 
the court, we gave him his passage (that is to say, bore his 
charges for his company), and used him as an interpreter, for he 
understood the language of the country, and spoke good French 
and a little English ; and, indeed, this old man was a most useful 
companion to us every where ; for we had not been above a week 
at Pekin, when he came laughing : " Ah, Signer Inglese," said 
he, " I have something to tell you, will make your heart glad." 
'* My heart glad?'' said I ; "what can that be ? I do not think 
any thing in this country can either give me joy or grief, to any 
great degree.'' " Yes, yes," said the old man, in broken Englitth; 
" make you glad, me sorrow ;" (sorry he would have said). This 
made me more inquisitive. " Why," said I, '* will it make you 
sorry ?" " Because," said he, " you have brought me here 
twenty-five days' journey, and will leave me to go back alone ; 
and which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without a ship, 
without a horse, without pecune ?" so he called money ; being 
his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry 
ivith. 

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite 
and Polish merchants in the city, who were preparing to set out 
on their journey by land to Muscovy within four or five weeks, 
and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with 
them, and leave him behind to go back all alone. I confess I 
was surprised with his news; a secret joy spread itself over my 
whole soul which I cannot describe, and never felt before or 
since ; and I had no power for a good while to speak a word to 
the old man ; but at last I turned to him, and inquired, " How 
do you know this ? Are you sure it is true?" " Yes," said he ; 
'' I met this morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine^ 
an Armenian, who is among them ; he came last from Astracan, 
and was designing to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, 
but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with the 
caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Wolga to Astracan." 
** Well, signor," said I, " do not be uneasy about being left to 
go back alone; if this be a method for my return to England, 
it shall be your fault if you go back to Macao at all." We 
then consulted together what was to be done ; and I asked my 



328 LIFE AND ADVENTURES J»T. U. 

partner what he thought of the pUot's news, and whether it 
would suit with his a&irs. He told me he would do just as I 
would ; for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and 
left his effects in sucli ^ood hands, that as we had made a good 
voyage here, if he could vest it in China silks, wrought and raw, 
such as might be worth the carriage, he would be content to go 
to England, and then make his voyage back to Bengal by toe 
company's ships. 

Having resolved upon this, we agreed, that if our Portugal 
pilot would go with us, we would bear his charges to Moscow, or 
to England, if he pleased. Nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed 
over-generous in that part neither, if we had not rewarded him 
farther ; for the service he had really done us was worth all that 
and more ; for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he 
had been like a broker for us on shore ; and his procuring for us 
the Japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets. 
So we consulted together about it ; and being willing to gratify 
him, which was, indeed, but doing him justice, and very willing 
also to have him with us besides, we agreed to give him a quantity 
of coined gold, which, as I compute it, came to about 175 pounds 
sterling between us, and to bear all his charges both for himself 
and horsO) except only a horse to carry his goods. 

Having settled this among ourselves, we called him to let him 
know what we had resolved. He received the proposal like a 
man transported, and told us he would go with us over the whole 
world ; and so, in short, we all prepared ourselves for the journey. 
However, as it was with us, so it was with the other merchants, 
they had many things to do ; and instead of being ready in five 
weeks, it was four months and some odd days before all things 
were got together. 

It was the beginning of February when we set out from 
Pekin. My partner and the old pilot had gone express back to 
the port where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods 
which we had left there ; and I, with a Chinese merchant, whom 
I had some knowledge of at Nanquin, and who came to Pekin on 
his own affairs, went to Nanquin, where I bought ninety pieces 
of tine damasks, with about two hundred pieces of other very fine 
silks of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these 
brought to Pekin against my partner's return. Besides this, 
we lK)ught a very large quantity of raw silk and some other 
goods, our cargo amounting in these goods alone to about three 
thousand five hundred pounds sterling ; which, together with tea 
and some fine calicoes, and three camel-loads of nutmegs and 
cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides those 
we rode upon ; which, with two or three spare horses, and two 
horses laden with provisions, made us, in short, twenty-six 
camels and horses in our retinue. 

The company was very great^ and; as near as I can remember, 



CH. VI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 329 

made between tbree and four hundred horse, and upwards of a 
hundred and twenty men, very well armed and provided for all 
events ; for as the eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by 
the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars ; but they are not alto- 
gether so dangerous as the Arabs, nor so barbarous when they 
prevail. 

The company consisted of people of several nations, but of 
Muscovites chiefly, for there were above sixty of them who were 
merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of them some were 
Livonians ; and, to our particular satisfaction, five of them were 
Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience in busi* 
ness, and men of very good substance. 

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who 
were Ave in number, called all the gentlemen and merchants, 
that is to say, all the passengers except the servants, to a great 
council, as they called it. At this great council every one de- 
posited a certain quantity of money to a common stock, for the 
necessary expense of buying forage on the way where it was not 
otherwise to be had, ancl for satisfying the guides, getting horses, 
and the like ; and here they constituted the journey, as they 
called it, that is, they named captains and officers to draw us all 
up, and give the command in case of an attack; and gave every 
one their turn of command. 

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and 
is full of potters and earth-makers, that is to say, people who 
tempered the earth for the china ware ; and, as I was coming 
along, our Portuguese pilot, who had always something to say to , 
make us merry, came sneering to me, and told me he would shew 
the greatest rarity in all the country, and that I should have 
this to say of China, that I had seen one thing which was not to 
be seen in all the world beside. I was very importunate to know 
what it was ; at last he told me it was a gentleman's house built 
all with china ware. " Well,'' says I, *' are not the materials 
of their building the product of their own country; and so it is 
all china ware, is it not ?" " No, no," says he, "I mean it is a 
house all made of china ware, such as you call it in England ; 
or, as it is called in our country, porcelain." " Well," says I, 
" such a thing may be. How big is it ? Can we carry it in a 
box upon a camel ? If we can, we will buy it." " Upon a 
camel !" says the old pilot, holding up both his hands, " why, 
there is a family of thirty people lives in it !" 

I was then curious indeed to see it ; and when I came to it, 
it was nothing but this : it was a timber house, or a house built^ 
as we call it in England, with lath and plaster, but all the plas- 
tering was really china ware, that is to say, it was plastered with 
the earth that makes china ware. 

The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and 
looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures 

F r 2 



330 LIFE AND ADVENTURES JPT. II. 

as the large china ware in England is painted, and hard as if 
it had been burnt. As to the inside, all the walls, instead of 
wainscot, were lined up with hardened and painted tiles, all 
made of the finest china, and the figures exceedingly iine indeed, 
with extraordinary variety of colours mixed with gold, many 
tiles making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar 
being made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see where 
the tiles met. The floors of the rooms were of the same compo- 
sition, and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in several 
parts of England, as hard as stone, and smooth, but not burnt, 
and painted, except some smaller rooms, like closets^ which were 
all, as it were, paved with the same tile ; the ceilings, and, in a 
word, all the plastering- work in the whole house, were of the 
same earth ; and, after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the 
same, but of a deep shining black. 

This was a china warehouse indeed, truly and literally to be 
called so ; and had I not been upon the joumey, I could haye 
stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it. They 
told me there were fountains and fish-ponds in the garden, all 
paved at the bottom and sides with the same ; and fine statues 
set up in rows on the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain 
earth, and burnt whole. 

As this is ope of the singularities of the Chinese, so they may 
he allowed to excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their 
accounts of it ; for they told me such incredible things of their 
performance in crockery ware, for such it is, that I care not to 
relate, as knowing it could not be true. They told me, in par- 
ticular, of one workman that made a ship, with all its tackle, and 
masts, and sails in earthenware, big enough to carry fifty men. 
If he had told me he launched it, and made a voyage to Ja|)an in 
it, I might have said something to it indeed ; but as it was I 
knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, asking pardon 
for the word, that the fellow lied ; so I smiled, and said nothing 
to it. 

This odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan ; for 
which the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of 
three shillings ; and told me, if it had been three days' journey 
without the wall as it was three days' within, he must have fined 
me four times as much, and made me ask pardon the next council- 
day : so I i)romised to be more orderly. Indeed, I found after- 
wards the orders made for keeping all together were absolut^y 
necessary for our common safety. 

In two days more we passed the great Chinese wall, made for 
a fortification against the Tartars ; and a very great work i% is, 
going over hills and mountains in a needless tracks where the 
rocks are impassable, and the precipices such as no enemy could 
]>ossibly enter, or, indeed, climb up; or where, if they did, no 
wall could hinder them. They teU us its length is near a thou- 



CH. VI. QF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 331 

sand English miles ; but that the country is five hundred, in a 
straight measured line, which the wall bounds, without measur- 
ing the windings and turnings it takes. It is about four fathoms 
high, and as many thick in some places. 

I stood still an hour, or thereabouts, without trespassing on 
our orders (for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to 
look at it on every side, near and far ofi^, — I mean what was within 
my view ; and the guide of our caravan, who had been extolling 
it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager to hear my 
opinion of it. I told him it was a most excellent thing to keep 
off the Tartars, which he happened not to understand as I meant 
it, and so took it for a compliment ; but the old pilot laughed. 
** O, Signor Inglese," says he, " you speak in colours.'' " In 
colours !" said I, " what do you mean by that?" *' Why, you 
speak what looks white this way, and black that way ; gay one 
way, and dull another way ; you tell him it is a good wall to 
keep out Tartars ; you tell me, by that, it is good for nothing 
but to keep out Tartars, or will keep out none but Tartars. I 
understand you, Signor Inglese, I understand you ; but Signor 
Chinese understood you his own way." 

"Well," said I, "signor, do you think it would stand out 
an army of our country people, with a good train of artillery ; or 
our engineers, with two companies of miners ? Would not they 
batter it down in ten days, that an army might enter in battalia, 
or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that there should be 
no sign of it left?" ** Ay, ay," says he, " I know that." The 
Chinese wanted greatly to know what I said, and I gave him 
leave to tell him a few days after, for we were then almost out of 
their country, and he was to leave us in a little time afterward ; 
but when he knew what I had said, he was dumb all the rest of 
the way, and we heard no more of his fine story of the Chinese 
power and greatness while he stayed. 

After we had passed this mighty wall (something like the 
Plots' wall, so famous in Northumberland, and built by the Ro- 
mans), we began to find the country thinly inhabited, and the 
people rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities, as 
being subject to the inroads and depredations of the Tartars, who 
rob in great armies, and therefore are not to be resisted by the 
naked inhabitants of an open country. 

And here I began to find the necessity of keeping together in 
a caravan as we travelled, for we saw several troops of Tartars 
roving about ; but when I came to see them distinctly, 1 won- 
dered more that the Chinese empire could be conquered by such 
contemptible foes ; for they are a mere horde or crowd of wild 
fellows, keeping no order, and understanding no discipline or 
manner of fight. 

Their horses are poor, lean, starved creatures, taught nothing 
and fit for nothing ; and this we said the first day we saw them. 



332 LIFE AND ADYBNTURES FT. II. 

which was after we entered the wilder part of the country. Our 
leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a 
hunting, as they call it; and what was this but bunting of 
sheep ! However, it may be called hunting too, for the creatures 
are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw of their kind, 
only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of sport 
when you begin the chase ; for they appear generally thirty or 
forty in a tiock, and, like true sheep, always keep together when 
they fly. 

In pursuit of this odd sort of game, it was our hap to meet 
with about forty Tartars. Whether they were hunting mutton, 
as we were, or whether they looked for another kind of prey, I 
know not ; but as soon as they saw us, one of them blew a kind 
of horn very loud, but with a barbarous sound that I had never 
heard before, and, by the way, never care to hear again. We all 
supposed this was to call their friends about them ; and so it was, 
for in less than half a quarter of an hour a troop of forty or fifty 
more appeared at about a mile distance ; but our work was over 
first, as it happened. 

One of the Scotch merchants of Moscow happened to be 
amongst us ; and as soon as he heard the horn, he told us, in 
short, that we had nothing to do but to charge them immediately, 
without loss of time ; and, drawing us up in a line, he asked if 
we were resolved ? We told him we were ready to follow him ; 
so he rode directly up to them. They stood gazing at us, like a 
mere crowd, drawn up in no order, nor shewing the face of any 
order at all ; but as soon as they saw us advance, they let fly 
their arrows, which, however, missed us very happily. It seems 
they mistook not their aim, but their distance ; for their arrows 
all fiell a little short of us, but with so true an aim, that had we 
been about twenty yards nearer, we must have had several men 
wounded, if not killed. 

Immediately we halted; and though it was at a great dis- 
tance, we fired , and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, 
following our shot full gallop, to fall in among them sword in 
hand ; for so our bold Scot that led us directed. He was, 
indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with such vigour and 
bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool courage too, 
that I never saw any man in action fitter for command. As 
soon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, 
and then drew our swords ; but they fled in the greatest con- 
fusion imaginable. The only stand any of them made was on 
our right, where three of them halted, and, by signs, called 
the rest to come back to them, having a kind of simitar in 
their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs. Our brave 
commander, without asking any body to follow him, galloped 
up close to them, and with his fusee knocked one of them off 
his horse, killing the second with his pistol. The third ran

• 

away. And thas ended our fight; but we had this misfortune 
attending it, namely, that all our mutton that we had in chase 
escaped. We had not a man killed or hurt; but as for the 
Tartars, there were about five of them killed, how many wounded 
we knew not ; but this we knew, that the other party was so 
frightened with the noise of our guns, that they made ofi^, and 
never made any attempt upon us. 

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and there- 
fore the Tartars were not so bold as afterwards. But in about 
hve days, we entered a vast desert, which held us three days' 
and nights' march ; and we were obliged to carry our water with 
us in great leathern bottles, and to encamp all nighty just as I 
have heard they do in the desert of Arabia. 

I asked whose dominion this was in ? And they told me this 
was a kind of border, that might be called no man's land ; 
being a part of the Great Karakathy, or Grand Tartary ; that, 
however, it was all reckoned to China; but that there was 
no care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves ; 
and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole 
world, though we were to go over some much larger. 

In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at the first 
very frightfiu to me, we saw two or three times little parties 
of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own afiairs, 
and to have no design upon us ; so, as they had nothing to say 
to us, we had nothing to say to them, and let them go. 

Once, however, a party of them came so near as to stand 
and gaze at us. Whether it was to consider what they should 
do, whether attack us, or not attack us, that we knew not; 
but when we were passed at some distance by them, we made 
a rear-guard of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting 
the caravan pass half a mile, or thereabouts, before us. But 
after a while they marched off, only we found they saluted us 
with ^Ye arrows at their parting; one of which wounded a 
horse, so that it disabled him ; and we left him the next day, 
poor creature, in great need of a good farrier. We suppose 
they might shoot more arrows, which might fall short of us ; 
but we saw no more arrows or Tartars at that time. 

We travelled near a month after this, the ways being not so 
good as at first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor 
of China ; but lay, for the most part, in villages, some of which 
were fortified, because of the incursions of the Tartars. When 
we came to one of these towns (it was about two days and a 
half journey before we were to come to the city Naum), I 
wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold 
all the way upon that road, and of horses also, such as they 
are, because so many caravans coming that way, they are very 
often wanted. The person that I spoke to to get me a camelt J 
would have gone and fetched it for me ; but I, like a fool^ musi J

• 



be officious, and go myself along with him. The place was 
about two miles out of the village, where, it seems, they kept 
the camels and horses feeding under a guard. 

I walked it on foot with my old pilot, being very desirous, 
forsooth, of a little variety. When we came to the place, it 
was a low marshy ground, walled round with a stone wall, 
piled up dry, without mortar or earth among it, like a park, 
with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the door. Having 
chosen a came), and agreed for the price, I came away, and 
the Chinese man that went with me led the camel ; when on a 
sudden came up five Tartars on horseback ; two of them seized 
the fellow, and took the camel from him, while the other three 
stepped up to me and my old pilot ; seeing us, as it were, un- 
armed, for I had no weapon about me but my sword, which 
could but ill defend me against three horsemen. The first that 
came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword (for they 
are arrant cowards) ; but a second coming up on my left, gave 
me a blow on the head, which I never felt till afterwards, and 
wondered, when I came to myself, what was the matter with 
me, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground ; but 
my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese (so Providence, un- 
looked for, directs deliverances from dangers which to us are 
unforeseen,) had a pistol in his pocket, which I knew nothing 
of, nor the Tartars either ; if they had, I suppose they would 
not have attacked us; but cowards are always boldest when 
there is no danger. 

The old man, seeing me down, with a bold heart stepped np 
to the fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his arm 
with one hand, and pulling him down by main force a little 
towards him with the other, he shot him in the head, and laid 
him dead upon the spot. He then immediately stepped up to 
him who had stopped us, as I said, and before he could come 
forward a^ain (for it was all done as it were in a moment) 
made a blow at him with a simitar, which he always wore, 
but missing the man, cut one of his horse's ears oif, and a 
great slice down the side of his face. The poor beast, enraged 
with the wound, was no more to be governed by his rider, 
though the fellow sat well enouorh too : but away he flew, and 
carried him quite out of the pilot's reach ; and at some dis- 
tance, rising up upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, 
and fell upon him. 

In this interval, the poor Chinese, who had lost the camel, 
came in, but he had no weapon ; however, seeing the Tartar 
down, and his horse fallen upon him, he ran to him, and 
seizing upon an ugly ill-favoured weapon he had by his side, 
something like a pole-axe, he wrenched it from him, and made 
shift to knock his Tartarian brains out with it. But my old man 
had the third Tartar to deal with still ; and seeing he did not flv, 



CH. VI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 835 

as he expected, nor come on to fight him, as he apprehended^ 
but stood stock-still, the old man stood still too, and fell to 
work with' his tackle to charge his pistol again : but as soon 
as the Tartar saw the pistol, whether he supposed it to be 
the same, or another, I know not; away he scoured, and left 
my pilot^ (my champion I called him atterwards,) a complete 
victor. 

By this time I was a little recovered ; for I thought, when 
I first began to awake, that I had been in a sweet sleep ; but, 
as I said above, I wondered where I was, how I came upon the 
ground, and what was the matter : in a word, a few moments 
after, as sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know 
where ; I put my hand to my head, and took it away bloody ; 
then I felt my head ache ; and then, in another moment, me- 
morv returned, and every thing was present to me again. 

I jumped up upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my 
sword ; but no enemies were in view. I found a Tartar lying 
dead, and his horse standing very quietly by him ; and looking 
farther, I saw my deliverer, who had been to see what the 
Chinese had done, coming back with his hanger in his hand. 
The old man, seeing me on my feet, came running to me, and 
embraced me with a great deal of joy, being afraid, before that, 
I had been killed ; and seeing me bloody, would examine how 
I was hurt ; but it was not much, only what we call a broken 
head ; neither did I afterwards find any great inconvenience 
from the blow. 

We made no great gain, however, by this victory ; for we 
lost a camel, and gained a horse. When we came back to the 
village, the man demanded to be paid for the camel ; I disputed 
it, and it was brought to a hearing before the Chinese judge 
of the place. To give him his due, he acted with a great deal 
of pruaence and impartiality ; and having heard both sides, he 
gravely asked the Chinese-man that went with me to buy the 
camel, whose servant he was? "I am no servant," said he, 
" but went with the stranger.'' *' At whose request ?" said 
the justice. *' At the stranger's request," said he. " Why, 
then," said the justice, ** you were the stranger's servant for 
the time ; and tne camel being delivered to his servant, it was 
delivered to him, and he must pay for it." 

I confess the thing was so clear, that I had not a word to 
say ; but paid willingly for the camel, and sent for another : 
but you may observe, I sent for it; I did not go to fetch it 
myself any more ; I had had enough of that. 

The city of Naum is a frontier of the Chinese empire : they 
call it fortified, and so it is, as fortifications go there ; for this 
I will venture to affirm, that all the Tartars in Karakathy, 
which, I believe, are some millions, could not batter down the 
walls with their bows and arrows ; but to call it strong, if it 



836 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

were attacked with cannon^ would be to make those who un- 
derstand it laugh at you. 

We wanted, as I have said, above two days' journey of this 
city, when messengers were sent express to every part of the 
road, to tell all travellers and caravans to halt, till they had 
a guard sent for them ; for that an unusual body of Tartars, 
m&ing ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way^ about 
thirty miles beyond the city. 

This was very bad news to travellers ; however, it was care- 
fully done of the governor, and we were very glad to hear we 
should have a guard. Accordingly, two days after, we had 200 
soldiers sent us from a garrison of the Chinese on our left, and 
800 more from the city of Naum, and with those we advanced 
boldly. The 800 soldiers from Naum marched in our front, 
the 200 in our rear, and our men on each side of our camels 
with our baggage, and the whole caravan in the centre. In this 
order, and well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves t 
match for the whole 10,000 Mogul Tartars, if they had ap- 
peared ; the next day, however, when they did appear, it nv 
quite another thing. 

It was early m the morning, when marching from a littkl 
town called Changu, we had a river to pass, which we wen 
obliged to ferry; and had the Tartars had any intelligence, tba 
had been the time to have attacked us, when, the caravan beiie| 
over, the rear-guard was behind : but they did not appear. 

About three hours after, when we were entered upon a deafil 
of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, we saw, by a cloud of dBsl 
they raised, that an enemy was at hand ; and they were at hiii| 
indeed, for they came on upon the spur. 

The Chinese, our guard on the front, who had talked so 
the day before, began to stagger, and the soldiers freqnc 
looked behind them ; which is a certain sign in a soldier, 
he is just ready to run away. My old pilot >vas of my mat\ 
and being near me, he called out ; " Signor Inglese, M 
fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; fcrr 
the Tartars come on, they will never stand it." **I •■< 
your opinion," said I: "but what course must be takff- 
"Why,'' said he; "let fifty of our men advance, and 
them on each wing, and encourage them, and they will 
like brave fellows in brave company ; but without, they 
every man turn his back." Immediately I rode up to 
leader, and told him. He was exactly of our mind * and 
cordinffly fifty of us marched to the right wing, and fiftr' 
the left, and the rest made a line of rescue ; and so we mtrt^ 
leaving the last 200 men to make another body by themsei* 
and to guard the camels ; only that, if need were thev 
send 100 men to assist the last fifty. 

In a word, the Tartars came on, and an innumcrabk cA 



CH. VI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 337 

pany they were ; how many we could not tell, but 10,000 we 
thought was the least. A party of them first approached, and 
viewed our posture, traversmg the ground in the front of our 
line ; and as we found them within gun-shot, our leader ordered 
the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a salvo on 
each wing with their shot, which was done ; but they retreated, 
and 1 suppose went back to give an account of the reception they 
were like to meet with. And, indeed, that salute cloeged their 
stomachs ; for they immediately halted, stood awhile to con- 
sider of it, and, wheeling off to the left, ^ave over the design, 
and said no more to us for that time ; wnich was very agree- 
able to our circumstances, which were but very indifferent for 
a battle with such a number. 

Two days after this we came to the city of Naun, or Naum. 
We thanked the governor for his care for us, and collected to 
the value of 100 crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the 
soldiers sent to guard us ; and here we rested one day. This was 
a garrison indeed, for there were nine hundred soldiers kept 
here ; but the reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite 
frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now, the Muscovites 
having abandoned that part of the country (which lies from 
this city west, for about 200 miles), as desolate and unfit for 
use ; and more especially, being so very remote, and so difficult 
to send troops thither for its defence ; for we had yet above 2000 
miles to Muscovy properly so called. 

After this we passed several great rivers, and two dreadful 
deserts, one of which we were sixteen days passing over, and 
which, as I said, was to be called no man's land ; and on the 
13th of April, we came to the frontiers of the Muscovite domi- 
nions. I think the first city, or town, or fortress, whatever it 
mi^ht be called, that belonged to the Czar of Muscovy, was 
called Argun, being on the west side of the river Argun. 

I could not but experience an infinite satisfaction that I was 
so soon arrived in, as I called it, a Christian country; or, at 
least, in a country governed by Christians. It would certainly 
occur to any man who travels the world as I have done, and 
who had any power of reflection, to consider what a blessing it 
is to be brought into a part of the world where the name of 
God and of a Rbdbemer is known, worshipped, and adored — 
and not where the people, given up to strong delusions, wor- 
ship the devil, and prostrate themselves to stocks and stones ; 
worship monsters, elements, and horrible-shaped animals, and 
statues, or images of monsters. Not a town or city we passed 
through but had their pagods, their idols, and their temples; 
and ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own 
hands ! 

Now we came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship 

G G 



338 LIFE AND AOVBNTTJBEB FT. II. 

appeared, where the knee was bowed to Jesus; and whether 
ignorantly or not, yet the Christian religion was owned, and 
the name of the true God was called upon and adored ; and it 
made the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see it. I saluted 
the brave Scotch merchant I mentioned above, with my first 
acknowledgment of this ; and, taking him by the hand^ i said 
to him, '^ Blessed be God, we are once again come among 
Christians !'' He smiled, and answered, ''Do not rejoice too 
soon, countryman ; these Muscovites are but an oda sort of 
Christians ; and but for the name of it, you may see very little 
of the substance for some months farther of our journey .'' 

" Well,'' said T, " but still it is better than paganism and 
worshipping of devils.'' " Why, I'll tell you," says he ; " except 
the Russian soldiers in garrisons, and a &w of the inhabitants of 
the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for above a 
thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most ignor- 
ant of pagans." And so, indeed, we found it. 

We now advanced by easy and moderate journeys, and were 
very visibly obliged to the care the Czar of Muscovy had taken 
to have cities and towns built in as many places as it is possible to 
place them, where his soldiers kept garrison, something like the 
stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest countries 
of their empire for the security of commerce, and for the lodging 
travellers. Wherever we came, though at these towns and 
stations the garrisons and governor were Russians and professed 
Christians, yet the inhabitants of the country were mere pagans, 
saqrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or 
all the host of heaven ; and not only so, but were, of all the 
heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous, 
except only that they did not eat man's flesh, like our savages of 
America. 

Some instances of this we met with in the country between 
Arguna, where we entered the Muscovite dominions ; in which 
is a continued desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to 
travel over it. In a village, near a city of Tartars and Russians 
together, called Nertzinskay, I had the curiosity to go and see 
their way of living ; which is most brutish and insuflTerable. 
They had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day ; for there stood 
out upon an old stump of a tree an idol made of wood, frightful 
as the devil ; at least, as any thing we can think of to represent 
the devil can be made. It had a head certainly not so much as 
resembling any creature that the world ever saw ; ears as big as 
goats' horns, and as high ; eyes as big as a crown piece ; a nose 
like a crooked ram's horn ; and a mouth extended four-cornered, 
like that of a lion, with horrible teeth, hooked like a parrot's 
under-bill. It was dressed up in the filthiest manner that you 
could suppose ; its upper garment was of sheep-skins, with the 



CR. YI. OF K0BIN80N CRUSOB. 839 

wool outward ; a great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two 
horns growing through it : it was about eight feet high, yet had 
no feet or legs, or any other proportion of parts. 

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village ; 
and when I came near to it, there were sixteen or seventeen 
creatures, whether men or women I could not tell, for they make 
no distinction by their dress, either of body or head ; these lay 
all flat on the ground, round this formidable block of shapeless 
wood. I saw no motion among them, any more than if they had 
been all logs of wood like the idol; and at first I really thought 
they had been so ; but when I came a little nearer, thev started 
up upon their feet ; and raised a howling cry, as if it had been so 
many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away as if they were 
displeased at our disturbing them. A little way off from the 
island, and at the door of that tent or hut, made all of sheep- 
skins and cow-skins dried, stood three butchers. They had long 
knives in their hands, and in the middle of the tent appeared 
three sheep killed, and one young bullock, or steer. These, it 
seems, were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol ; and these 
three men priests belonging to it ; and the seventeen prostrated 
wretches were the people who brought the offering, and were 
making their prayers to that stock. 

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish 
worship of a hobgoblin than ever I was at any thin^ in my life. 
To see God's most glorious and best creature — to whom He had 
granted so many advantages, even by creation, above the rest of 
the works of His hands, vested with a reasonable soul, and that 
soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to honour 
his Maker, and to be honoured by Him — sunk and degenerated 
to a degree so more than stupid as to prostrate itself before a 
frightful nothing, a mere imaginary object dressed up by them- 
selves, and made terrible to themselves by their own contrivance, 
adorned only with rags ; and that this should be the effect of 
mere i^iorance, wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil 
himself, who, envying his Maker the homage and adoration of 
His creatures, )iad deluded them into such sross, sordid, and 
brutish things, as one would think should shock nature itself. 

But what signified all the astonishment and reflection of 
thoughts ? Thus it was, and I saw it before my eyes ; and there 
was no room to wonder at it, or think it impossible. All my 
admiration turned to rage ; and I rode up to the image or mon- 
ster, call it what you will, and with my sword cut the bonnet 
that was on its head in two in the middle, so that it hung down 
by one of the horns ; and one of our men that was with me 
took hold of the sheep-skin that covered it, and pulled at it, 
when, behold, a most hideous outcry and howling ran through 
the village, and two or three hundred people came about my 
ears^ so l£at I was glad to run for it ; for we saw some had bowa 



340 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

and arrows. But I resolved from that moment to visit them 
again. 

Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was about 
four miles off, in order to provide some horses, which they 
wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with 
the badness of the way, and the long march over the last desert. 
So we had some leisure here to put my design in execution. I 
communicated my project to the Scotch merchant of Moscow, of 
whose courage I had had suflScient testimony before. I told him 
what I had seen, and with what indignation I had since thought 
that human nature could be so degenerate. I told him, I was 
resolved, if I could get but four or five men well armed to go 
with me, to go and destroy that vile abominable idol ; and let 
them see that it had no power to help itself, and consequently 
could not be an object of worship, or be prayed to, much less 
help them that offered sacrifices to it. 

He laughed at me, and said, '* Your zeal may be good ; but 
what do you propose to yourself by it?" " Propose!*' said I, 
** to vindicate the honour of God, which is insulted by this devil- 
worship." " But how will it vindicate the honour of God," said 
he, "while the people will not be able to know what you mean by 
it, unless you could speak to them, and tell them so ? and then 
they will fight you and beat you too, I will assure you ; for they 
are desperate fellows, and that especially in defence of their 
idolatry." " Can we not," said I, " do it m the night, and then 
leave them the reasons and causes, in writing, in their own 
language?" " Writing !" said he, " why there is not a man in 
^ve nations of them that knows any thing of a letter, or how to 
read a word in any language, or in their own." "Wretched 
ignorance!" said I to him ; "however, I have a great mind to 
do it ; perhaps nature may draw inferences from it to them, to 
let them see now brutish they are to worship such horrid things.*' 
** Look you, sir," said he ; " if your zeal prompts you to it so 
warmly, you must do it; but in the next place, I would have you 
consider that these wild nations of people are subjected by force 
to the Czar of Muscovy's dominions ; and if you do this, it is ten 
to one but they will come by thousands to the governor of Ner- 
tzinskay, and complain, and demand satisfaction ; and if he can- 
not give them satisfaction, it is ten to one but they revolt ; and 
it will occasion a new war with all the Tartars in the country." 

This, I confess, put new thoughts into my head for a while ; 
but I harped upon the same string still ; and all that day I was 
uneasy to put my project in execution. Towards the evening, 
the Scotch merchant met me by accident in our walk about the 
town, and desired to speak with me. " I believe," said he, "I 
liave put you off your good design. I have been a little con- 
cerned about it since •, \*ot \ ^\i\voT 1\\^ Idol and the idolatry as 
much as you can do," " 'IimI^ i^ ^^\^\ ^'' ^Q.xi.Xia:^'^ Y^ *>2^. ^^ ^ 



CH. YI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 341 

little as to the execution of it, but you have not put it at all out 
of my thoughts ; and, I believe, I shall do it still before I quit 
this place, though I were to be delivered up to them for satis- 
faction." " No, no," says he, " God forbid they should deliver 
you up to such a crew of monsters ; they shall not do that neither ; 
that would be murdering you indeed." *' Why," said I, "bow 
would they use me ?" "Use you !" replied he ; "I will tell you 
how they served a poor Russian, who affronted them in their 
worship just as you did, and whom they took prisoner, after they 
had lamed him with an arrow, that he could not run away. They 
took him and stripped him stark naked, and set him upon the 
top of the idol monster, and stood all round him, and shot as 
many arrows into him as would stick over his whole body ; and 
then they burnt him and all the arrows sticking in him, as a 
sacrifice to the idol." "And was this the same idol ?" " Yes," 
said he, " the very same. It was not this village, it was almost 
a hundred miles from this place ; but it was the same idol, for 
they carry him about in procession all over the country." **Well, 
then," said I, " that idol ought to be punished for it ; and so it 
shall, if I live this night out." 

Finding me resolute, he liked the design, and told me, I 
should not go alone, but he would go with me ; and bring a 
stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to accompany us ; " And 
one," says he, " as famous for his zeal as you can desire any 
one to be against such devilish things as these." In a word, he 
brought me his comrade, a Scotchman, whom he called Captain 
Bichardson; and I gave him a full account of what I had seen, 
and of what I intended ; and he told me readily, he would go 
with me if it cost him his life. So we agreed to go, only we 
three and my man-servant, and put it in execution that night, 
about midnight, with all the secrecy imaginable. 

However, upon second thoughts, we were willing to delay it 
till the next night, because the caravan being to set forward in 
the morning, we supposed the governor could not pretend to 
give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his 
power. The Scotch merchant, as steady in his resolution for the 
enterprise as bold in executing it, brought me a Tartar's robe or 
gown of the sheep-skins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, 
and had provided the same for himself and his countryman ; that 
the people, if they saw us, should not be able to determine who 
we were. 

All the firi*t night we spent in mixing up some combustible 
matter with aquavitse, gunpowder, and such other materials as 
we could get ; and, having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, 
about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition. 

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and 
found that the people had not the least fe^T oi ^wsv^'et 5^\\5s^^^^ 
their idol The night was cloudy, -jet Xk'a tcvqoti ^n^ ^5S»^*S«^ 

G Oa

enough to see tbat the idol stood just in the same posture and 
place that it did before. The people seemed to be all at their 
rest ; only that in the great hut, or tent, where we saw the three 
priests whom we mistook for butchers^ we saw a light, and going 
up to the door, we heard people talking, as if there were five or six 
of them. We concluded, therefore, that if we set the wild-fire to 
the idol, these men would come out immediately, and run up to 
the place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended for 
it; and what to do with them we knew not. Once we thought of 
carrying it away, and setting fire to it at a distance ; but when 
we came to handle it, we found it too bulky ; so we were at a loss 
again. The second Scotchman was for setting fire to the tent or 
hut, and knocking the creatures that were there on the head, 
when they came out ; but I could not join with that ; I was 
against killing them, if it was possible to be avoided. ''Well, 
then," said the Scotch merchant, ** I will tell you what we will 
do ; we will try to take them prisoners, tie their hands behind 
them, and make them stand still and see their idol destroyed." 

As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough about 
us, which was used to tie our fire-works together with ; so we 
resolved to attack these people first, and with as little noise as 
we could. The first thing we did was to knock at the door. It 
was opened by one of their idol priests, whom we immediately 
seized. We stopped his mouth, tied his hands behind him, and 
led him to the idol, where we gagged him that he might not 
make a noise ; tied his feet also together, and left him on the 
ground. 

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another 
would come out to see what was the matter ; but we waited so 
long that the third man came back to us, and then, nobody 
coming out, we knocked again gently, and immediately out came 
two more, and we served them just in the same manner, but were 
all obliged to go with them, and lay them down by the idol 
some distance from one another; when, going back, we found 
two more were come out to the door, and a third stood behind 
them within the door. We seized the two, and immediately tied 
them ; when the third stepping back, and crying out, my Scutch 
merchant went in after him, and taking out a composition we 
had made, that would only smoke and stmk, he set fire to it, and 
threw it in among them : by that time the other Scotchman and 
my man taking charge of the two men who were already bound, 
and tied together also by the arm, led them away to the idol and 
left them there, to see if their idol would relieve them, making 
haste back to us. 

When the fuzee we had thrown in had filled the hut with so 
much smoke that they were almost suffocated, we then threw ii 
a small leather bag oi«LTio\\iCT Vw\TA,^\vvc\vft«Lmed like a candle^

who, it seems, were two men and two women ; and, as we sup- 
posed, had been about some of their diabolic sacrifices. They 
appeared, in short, frightened to death, at least so as to sit trem- 
bling and stupid, and not able to speak either for the smoke. 

In a word, we took them, bound them as we had the others, 
and all without any noise. I should have said, we brought them 
out of the house or hut first ; for, indeed, we were not able to 
bear the smoke any more than they were. When we had done 
this, we carried them all together to the idol ; when we came there, 
we fell to work with him. First we daubed him all over, and 
his robes also, with tar, and such other stuff as we had, which 
was tallow mixed with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes, 
and ears, and mouth full of gunpowder ; then we wrapped up a 
great piece of wild-fire in his bonnet ; and then sticking all the 
combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we looked about 
to see if we could find any thing else to help to burn him ; when 
my man remembered, that by the tent, or hut, where the men 
were, there lay a heap of dry forage, whether straw or rushes 
I do not remember : away he and one of the Scotchmen ran, 
and fetched their arms fuU of that. When we had done this, we 
took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their 
feet, and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and 
set them just before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the 
whole. 

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, till the 
powder in the eyes, and mouth, and ears of the idol blew up, 
and, we could perceive, had split and deformed the shape ; and, 
in a word, till we saw it burnt into a mere block or log of wood : 
and then setting the dry forage to it, we found it would be quite 
consumed. We now began to think of coming away ; but the 
Scotchrajm said, " No, we must not go yet ; for these poor de- 
luded wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn 
themselves with the idol." We therefore resolved to stay till 
the forage was burnt down too, and then we came away and left 
them. 

In the morning we appeared among our fellow-travellers, 
exceedingly busy in getting ready for our journey ; nor could 
any man suspect that we had been any where but in our beds, 
as travellers mi^ht be supposed to be, to fit themselves for the 
fatigues of the fmlowing day. 

But it did not end so ; the next day came a great multitude 
of the country people, not only of this village, but of a hundred 
more, to the town-gates ; and in a most outrageous manner de- 
manded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting 
, their priests, and burninff their great Cham-Chi-Thaungu ; such 
a hard name they gave the monstrous creature they worshipped i 
The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease them, 
and gave them all the good words imaginable. He assured 



344 LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

them he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a soul of his 
garrison been abroad ; that it could not be from any body there ; 
and if they would let him know who it was, they should be ex- 
emplarily punished. They returned haughtily: That all the 
country reverenced the great Cham-Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in 
the sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to 
his image but some Christian miscreant ; and (hey therefore 
denounced war against him, and all the Russians; who, they 
said, were miscreants and Christians. 

The governor, still patient, and unwilling to make a breach, 
or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him, the 
Czar having straitly charged them to treat the conquered country 
with gentleness and civility, gave them still all the good words 
he could ; at last told them, there was a caravan gone towards 
Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them who 
had done them this injury ; and that, if they would be satis- 
fied with that, he would send after them, to inquire into it. This 
seemed to appease them a little ; and accordingly the governor 
sent after us, and gave us a particular account how the thing 
was ; intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had done it, 
they should make their escape ; but that, whether they had done 
it or no, we should make all the haste forward that was possible; 
and that in the mean time, he would keep them in play as long 
as he could. 

This was very friendly in the governor. However, when it 
came to the caravan, there was nobody knew any thing of the 
matter ; and, as for us that were guilty, we were the least of all 
suspected; none so much as asked us the question. However, 
the captain of the caravan, for the time, took the hint that the 
governor gave us, and we marched or travelled two days and 
two nights without any considerable stop, and then we lay at i 
village called Plothus ; nor did we make any long stay here, but 
hastened on towards Jarawena, another of tlie Czar of Muscotv'i 
colonies, and where we expected we should be safe. But it is'to 
be observed, that here we began, for two or three days' mareh, 
to enter upon the vast nameless desert, of which I shall say more i 
in its place; and which, if we had now been upon, it is m(W 
than probable we had been all destroyed. It was the seccnxi 
day's march from Plothus, that by the clouds of dust behind • 
at a great distance, some of our people began to be sensible im 
were pursued. We had entered the desert, and had passed byi 
ereat lake, called Schanks Osier, when we perceived a very gtm 
body of horse appear on the other side of the lake to the dotAI 
we travelling west. We observed they went away west, as «| 
did; but had supposed we would have taken that side of" 
lake, whereas we very happily took the south side ; and in 
days more we saw them not, for they, believing we were 
before them, pushed on, till they came to the river Udda. 



CH. YI. OF BOBINSON CRUSOB^ 845 

is a very great riyer when it passes farther north 5 but where we 
came to it, we found it narrow and fordable. 

The third day they either found their mistake, or had intel- 
ligence of us, and came pouring in upon us, towards the dusk 
of the evening. We had, to our great satis^ction, just pitched 
upon a place for our camp, which was very convenient for the 
night ; tor as we were upon a desert, though but at the beginning 
of it, that was above five hundred miles over, we had no towns 
to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena, 
which we had yet two days' march to ; the desert, however, had 
some few woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all 
into the great river Udda. It was in a narrow strait, between 
two little but very thick woods, that we pitched our camp for 
that night, expecting to be attacked in the night. 

Nobody knew but ourselves what we were pursued for ; but 
as it was usual for the Mongul Tartars to eo about in troops in 
that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves every night 
against them, as against armies of robbers ; and it was therefore 
no new thing to be pursued. 

But we had this night a most advantageous camp ; for we lay 
between two woods, with a little rivulet running just before our 
front ; so that we could not be surrounded or attacked any way 
but in our front or rear. We took care also to make our front as 
strong as we could, by placing our packs with our camels and 
horses all in a line on the inside of the river, and felling some 
trees in our rear. 

In this posture we encamped for the night ; but the enemy 
was upon us before we had finished our situation. They did not 
come like thieves, as we expected, but sent three messengers to us, 
to demand the men to be delivered to them that had abused their 
priests, and burnt their god Cham-Chi-Thaungu, that they might 
bum them ; and, upon this, they said they would go away, and 
do us no farther harm, otherwise they would burn us all. Our 
men looked very blank at this message, and began to stare at 
one another, to see who looked with most guilt in their faces ; 
but, nobody was the word, nobody did it. The leader of the 
caravan sent word, he was well assured it was not done by any 
of our camp ; that we were peaceable merchants, travelling on 
our business ; that we had done no harm to them, or to any one 
else; and that therefore they must look farther for their ene- 
mies, who had injured them, for we were not the people. So 
desired them not to disturb us ] for if they did, we should de- 
fend ourselves. 

They were far from being satisfied with this answer; so a 
great crowd of theni came down in the morning, by break of day, 
to our camp ; but seeing us in such an unaccountable situation, 
they durst come no farther than the brook in our front, where 
they stood, and shewed us such a number as indeed terrified 



346 LIFB AND ADYBNTUBES FT. II. 

US verymucli; for those that spoke least of them spoke often 
thousand. Here they stood, and looked at us awhile, and then 
setting up a great howl, they let fl v a cloud of arrows among us ; 
but we were well enough fortified for that, for we sheltered under 
our baggage, and I do not remember that one man of us was 
hurt. 

Some time after this, we saw them move a little to our right, 
and expected them on the rear, when a cunning fellow, a Cossack, 
in the pay of the Muscovites, calling to the leader of the caravan, 
said to him, '^ I will go send all these people away to Sibeilka." 
This was a city at least four or five days' journey to the south, 
and rather benind us. So he takes his bow and arrows, and, 
getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear, directly, as 
it were, back to Nertzinskay ; after this he takes a gfreat circuit 
about, and comes to the army of the Tartars, as if he had been 
sent express to tell them a long story, that the people who had 
burnt their Chara-Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a 
caravan of Christians ; and that they had res(blved to bum the 
god Seal Isarg, belonging to the Tongueses. 

As this fellow was himself a mere Tartar, and spoke their 
language perfectly, he counterfeited so well, that they all took 
it from him, and away they drove, in a most violent hurry, to 
Sibeilka, which, it seems, was five days' journey from where 
we were ; and in less than three hours they were entirely out of 
our sight, and we never heard any more of them. ^ 

So we passed safely on to the city of Jarawena, where there 
was a garrison of Muscovites ; and there we rested five days, 
the caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last day's hard 
march, and from want of rest in the night. 

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us three- 
and-twenty days' march. We furnished ourselves with some 
tents here, for the better accommodating ourselves in the night ; 
and the leader of the caravan procur^ sixteen carriages, or 
waggons, of the country, for carrying our water and provisions. 
These carriages served also for our defence every night round our 
little camp ; so that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had 
been very numerous indeed, they would not have been able to 
hurt us. 

After we had passed this desert, we came into a country pretty 
well inhabited ; that is to say, we found there towns and castles 
settled by the Czar of Muscovy, having garrisons of stationary 
soldiers to protect the caravans, and defend the country against 
the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very dangerous tra- 
velling ; and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders for 
the well-guarding of the caravans and merchants, that if there 
are any Tartars heard of in the country, detachments of the 
garrisons are always sent to see the travellers safe from station 
to station. 



CH. YI. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 347 

I thought long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe^ 
we should find the country better peopled, and the people more 
civilised ; but I found myself mistaken in both, for we had yet 
the nation of the Tongueses to pass through ; where we saw the 
same tokens of paganism and barbarity, or worse than before ; 
only as they were conquered by the Muscovites, and entirely re- 
duced, they were not so dangerous ; but for rudeness of manners 
and idolatry, no people in the world ever went beyond them.. 
They all are clothed in skins of beasts, and their houses are built 
of the same. You know not a man from a woman, neither by 
the ruggedness of their countenances nor their clothes ; and in the 
winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live under 
ground, in houses like vaults, which have cavities going from one 
to another. 

If the Tartars had their Cham-Chi-Thaungu for a whole vil- 
lage, or country, these had idols in every hut and in every cave; 
besides, they worshipped the stars, the sun, the water, the snow, 
and, in a word, every thin^ that they do not understand ; and 
they understand but very little — so tnat almost every element^ 
every uncommon thing, sets them a sacrificing. 

I met with nothing peculiar to myself in all this country, 
which, I reckon, was, from the desert which I spoke of last, at 
least four hundred miles, half of it being another desert, which 
took us up twelve days' severe travelling, without house, or tree, 
or bush ; but we were obliged again to carry our own provisions, 
as well water as bread. After we were out of this desert, and 
had travelled two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or 
station, on the great river Janezay. This river is the eastern 
boundary of the ancient Siberia, which now makes up a province 
only of the vast Muscovite empire, but is itself equal in bigness 
to the whole empire of Germany. 

And yet here I observed ignorance and paganism still pre- 
vailed, except in the Muscovite garrisons. AH the country be- 
tween the river Oby and the river Janezay is as entirely pagan, 
and the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the Tartars ; nay, 
as any nation, for aught I know, in Asia or America. I also 
found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors, whom I 
had opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not 
much the wiser, or the nearer Christianity, for being under the 
Muscovite government. This they acknowledged to be true 
enough, but, as they said, was none of their business ; that if the 
Czar expected to convert his Siberian, or Tonguese, or Tartar 
subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen among them, 
not soldiers; and they added, with more sincerity than I ex- 
pected, that they found it was not so much the concern of their 
monarch to make the people Christians, as it was to make them 
subjects. 

From this river to the great river Oby, we crossed a wild 



348 ADTBNTUBRB OF ROBIKaOir CRUSOE. FT. II. 

vncultivated country : I cannot say it ii a barren toil ; it is only 
barren of people and good management ; otherwise it is in it- 
self moat pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable. What inhabitants we 
found in it were all ^a^ua, except sucb as are sent among tbem 
from Russia ; for this is the country, I mean on both sides the 
river Oby, whither the Muscovite crimiuaU, that are not put to 
death, are banished ; and from whence it is next to impossible 
they should ever come away. 



journey, and winter be{;an to come on apace ^ wbereupon my 
partner and I called a council about out particular afraire; in 
which we found it proper, considering that we were bound for 
England, and not for Moscow, to consider how to dispose of our- 
selves. Tliey told us of sledges and rein-deer to carry ns over 
the snow in tbe winter-tlme ; and, indeed, they have such things, 
that it would be incredible to relate the particulars of, by which 
Tneans tbe Russians travel more in the winter than they can in 
summer ; because in these sledges they are able to run night and 
day. The snow being frozen, is one universal covering to na- 
ture, bywhich the hills, the valea, the rivers, the lakes, are all 
smooth, and hard as a stone ; and they run upon the surface, with- 
out any regard to what i« undemeatn. 

But I bad no occation to push at a winter journey of this 
kind ; I was bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route 
lay two ways ; either I must go on as the caravan went, till I 
came to Jarislaw, and then go off west for Narva and the gulf 
of Finland, and ao either by sea or land to Dantzic, where I 
might possibly sell my China cargo to good advantage; or I 
must leave the caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from 



'A . 



350 • LIFE AND ADVENTURES PT. II. 

whence I had but six days by water to Archangel, and from 
thence might be sure of shipping, either to England, Holland, 
or Hamburgh. 

Ngw to go any of these journeys in the winter would have 
been preposterous ; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would be frozen 
up, and I could not get passage ; and to go by land in those 
countries was far less safe than among the Mongu] Tartars ; like- 
wise to go to Archangel, in October all the ships would be gone 
from thence ; and even the merchants, who dwell there in sum- 
mer, retire south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are 
gone ; so that I should have nothing but extremity of cold to en- 
counter, with a scarcity of provisions, and must lie there in an 
empty town all the winter. So that, upon the whole, I thought 
it much my better way to let the caravan go, and to make pro- 
vision to winter where I was, namely at Tobolski, in Siberia, in 
the latitude of sixty degrees, where I was sure of three things to 
wear out a cold winter with, namely plenty of provisions such 
as the country afforded, a warm house with fuel enough, and 
excellent company. 

I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved island, 
where I never felt cold except when I had my ague ; on the con- 
trary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back, aod 
never made any fire but without doors, and for my necessity in 
dressing my food, &c. Now I made me three good vests, with 
large robes or gowns over them to han^ down to the feet, and 
button close to the wrists ; and all these lined with furs to make 
them sufficiently warm. 

As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly disliked our 
way in England, of making fires in every room in the house in 
open chimneys, which, when the fire was out, always kept the air 
in the room as cold as the climate. But taking an apartment in 
a good house in the town, I ordered a chimney to be built like a 
furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove ; the 
funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the door to come at 
the fire went in another, and all the rooms were kept equally 
warm, but no fire was visible. 

By this means we had always the same climate in all the 
rooms, and an equal heat was preserved ; and how cold soever 
it was without, it was always warm within ; and yet we saw no 
fire, nor were ever incommoded by any smoke. 

The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible 
to meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous as 
that of the most northerly parts of Europe, near the frozen ocean, 
and within but a very few degrees of Nova Zembla. 

But this being the country where the state criminals of Mus- 
covy, as I observed before, are all banished, this city was full of 
noblemen, princes, gentlemen, colonels, and, in short, all degrees 
of the nobility, gentry, soldiery, and courtiers of Muscovy. 



CH. YII. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 351 

By means of my Scotch merchant, whom, nevertheless^ I 
parted with here, I made an acquaintance with several of these 
gentlemen, and some of them of the first rank : and from these, 
m the long winter nights in which I stayed here, I received 
several very agreeable visits. It was in conversation one night 
with Prince , one of the banished ministers of state belong- 
ing to the Czar of Muscovy, that my talk of my particular case 
began. He had been telling me abundance of fine things, of the 
greatness, the magnificence, the dominions, and the absolute 
power of the Emperor of the Russians. I interrupted him, and 
told him I was a greater and more powerful prince than ever the 
Czar of Muscovy was, though my dominions were not so large, 
or my people so many. The Russian grandee looked a little sur- 
prised, and fixing his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder 
what I meant. 

I told him his wonder would cease when I had explained 
myself. First, I remarked, I had the absolute disposal of the 
lives and fortunes of all my subjects ; that, notwithstanding my 
absolute power, I had not one person disaffected to my govern- 
ment or to my person in all my dominions. He shook his head 
at that, and said, there, indeed, I outdid the Czar of Muscovy. 
I told liim, that all the lands in my kingdom were my own, and 
all my subjects were not only my tenants, but tenants at will ; 
that they would all fight for me to the last drop ; and that never 
tyrant (for such I acknowledged myself to be) was ever so uni- 
versally beloved, and yet so greatly feared by his subjects. 

After amusing him with these riddles in government for a 
while, I told him the story at large of my living in the island, 
and how I managed both myself and the people there that were 
under me, just as I have since minuted it down. He was exceed- 
ingly taken with the story, and told me, with a sigh, that the 
true greatness of life was to be master of ourselves ; that he 
would not have exchanged such a state of life as mine to have 
been Czar of Muscovy ; and that he found more felicity in the 
retirement he seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found 
in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his royal 
master; that the height of human wisdom was to bring our 
tempers down to our circumstances, and to make a calm within, 
under the weight of the greatest scorns without. When he came 
first hither, he said, he used to tear the hair from his head and 
the clothes from his back, as others had done before him ; but a 
little time and consideration had made him look into himself, as 
well as round him to things without ; that he found the mind of 
man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the state of uni- 
versal life, and how little this world was concerned in its true 
felicity, was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself, fully 
satisfying to itself and suitable to its own best ends and desires, 
with but very little assistance from the world ; that air to breathe 



352 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

in, food to sustain life, clothes for warmth, and liberty for exer- 
cise in order to health, completed, in his opinion, all that the 
world could do for us ; and though the greatness, tlie authority, 
the riches, and the pleasures, which some enjoyed in this world, 
and which he had enjoyed his share of, had much in them that 
was agreeable to us; yet, he observed, that all those things 
chiefly gratified the coarsest of our affections, such as our am- 
bition, our selfishness, our pride, our avarice, our vanity, and 
our sensuality : all which were, indeed, the mere product of the 
worst part of man, were in themselves crimes, and had in them 
the seeds of all manner of crime ; but neither were related to or 
concerned with any of those virtues that constituted us wise men, 
or of those graces which distinguished us as Christians ; that 
being now deprived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed 
in the full exercise of all those vices, he said he was at leisure to 
look upon the dark side of them, where he found all manner of 
deformity ; and was now convinced that virtue only makes a man 
truly wise, rich, and great, and preserves him in the way to a 
superior happiness in a future state ; and in this, he said, they 
were more happy in their banishment than all their enemies were, 
who had the full possession of all the wealth and power that they 
(the banished) had left behind them. 

" Nor, sir," said he, ** do I bring my mind to this politically, 
by thenecessity of my circumstances, which some call miserable; 
but, if I know any thing of myself, I would not now go back, 
though the Czar, my master, should call me, and reinstate me in 
all my former grandeur ; I say, I would no more go back to it 
than I believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison 
of the body, and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life, 
would come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclosed 
in, and leave heaven to deal in the dirt and crime of human 
affairs." 

He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much 
earnestness and motion of his spirits, which were apparent in his 
countenance, that it was evident it was the true sense of his soul ; 
there was no room to doubt his sincerity. 

I told him, I once thought myself a kind of a monarch in 
my old station, of which I had given him an acx;ount ; but that I 
thought he was not a monarch only, but a great conqueror ; for 
that he that has got a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and 
has the absolute dominion over himself, whose reason entirely 
governs his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a city. 
** But, my lord," said I, " shall I take the liberty to ask you 
a question?" " With all my heart,** says he. " If the door of 
your liberty was opened," said I, " would you not take hold of it 
to deliver yourself from this exile ?" 

** Hold !" answered he ; " your question is subtle, and requires 
some serious just distmctions to give it a sincere answer; and I 



CH. VII. OF BOBINSON CBUSOB. 353 

will give it you from the bottom of my heart. Nothing that I 
know of in tnis world would move me to deliver myself from this 
state of banishment, except these two : first, the enjoyment of my 
relations ; and, secondly, a little warmer climate. But I protest 
to you, that to go back to the pomp of the court, the glory, the 
power, the hurry of a minister of state ; the wealth, the gaiety, 
and the pleasures, that is to say, follies of a courtier ; if my master 
should send me word this moment, that he restores me to all he 
banished me from, I protest, if I know myself at all, I would not 
leave this wilderness, these deserts, and these frozen lakes, for 
the palace of Moscow.'' 

" But, rty lord," said I, " perhaps you not only are banished 
from the pleasures of the court, and from the power and autho- 
rity and wealth you enjoyed before, but you may be absent, too, 
from some of the conveniences of life ; your estate, perhaps, con- 
fiscated, and your effects plundered ; and the supplies left you here 
may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life." 

" Ay," said he, " that is as you suppose me to be, a lord, or a 
prince, &c. So, indeed, I am ; but you are now to consider me 
only as a man, a human creature, not at all distinguished from 
another ; and so I can suffer no want, unless I should be visited 
with sickness and distempers. However, to put the question out 
of dispute, you see our manner ; we are in this place five persons 
of rank; we live perfectly retired, as suited to a state of banish- 
ment ; we have something rescued from the shipwreck of our 
fortunes, which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting for 
our food ; but the poor soldiers who are here without that help, 
who go into the woods and catch sables and foxes, live in as 
much plenty as we. The labour of a month will maintain them 
a year ; and as the way of living is not expensive, so it is not 
hard to get sufficient for ourselves. So that that objection is out 
of doors." 

I have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable 
conversation I had with this truly great man ; in all which he 
shewed that his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge 
of things, so supported by religion, as well as by a vast share of 
wisdom^ that his contempt ot the world was really as much as 
he had expressed, and that he was always the same to the last, 
as will appear in the story I am going to tell. 

I had been here eight months, and a dark dreadful winter I 
thought it to be ; the cold was so intense that I could not so 
much as look abroad without being wrapped in furs, and a mask 
of fur before my face, or rather a hood, with only a hole for 
breath, and two for sight. The little daylight we had, was, as 
we reckoned, for three months, not above five hours a-day, and 
six at most ; only that the snow lying on the ground continually, 
and the weather being clear, it was never quite dark. Our horses 
were kept (or rather starved) under ground j and as for our ser- 

H H 2 



354 LIFE AND ADVBMTDBBS FT. II. 

vants (for we hired three servants here to look after our horses 
and selves), we had every now and then their fingers and toes 
to thaw and take care of, Jest they should mortify and fall off. 

It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close, 
the walls thick, the lights small, and the glass all double. Our 
food was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season, 
good bread enough, but baked as biscuits, dried flsh of several 
sorts, and some flesh of mutton, and of the buflaloes, which is 
pretty good beef. All the stores of provisions for the winter are 
laid up in the summer, and well cured ; our drink was water 
mixed with aquavitse instead of brandy, and, for a treat, mead 
instead of wine, which, however, they have extremely good. The 
hunters, who venture abroad all weathers, frequently brought us 
in fresh venison, very fat and good, and sometimes bears' flesh, 
but we did not much care for the last. We had a good stock 
of tea, with which we treated our friends ; and, in a word, we 
lived very cheerfully and well, all things considered. 

It was now March, and the days had grown considerably 
longer, and the weather at least tolerable ; so the other travellers 
began to prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to 
get things ready to be going. But my measures being fixed, as 
I have said, for Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, 
I made no movement, knowing very well that the ships from 
the south do not set out for that part of the world till May or 
June, and that if I was there by the beginning of August it would 
be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away ; and there- 
fore I saw a great many people, nay, all the travellers, go away 
before me. It seems that every year they go from thence to Mos- 
cow for trade, viz. to carry furs, and buy necessaries with them, 
which they bring back to furnish their shops. Also others went 
on the same errand to Archangel ; but then they also being to 
come back again above eight hundred miles, went all out be- 
fore me. 

In short, about the latter end of May I began to make all 
ready to pack up ; and as I was doing this, it occurred to me, 
that seeing all these people were banished by the Czar of Mus- 
covy to Siberia, and yet when they came there were left at 
liberty to go whither they would, why did they not then go away 
to any part of the world wherever they thought fit? And 1 be- 
gan to examine what should hinder them from making such an 
attempt. 

But my wonder was over when I entered upon that subject 
with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus: 
"Consider, first, sir,'' said he, **the place where^we are ; and, 
secondly, the condition we are in, especially the generality of 
the people who are banished hither. We are surrounded with 
stronger things than bars and bolts ; on the north side an un- 
navigable ocean, where ship uever sailed and boat never swam ; 



CH. VII. OF ROBINSON CRUSOB. 355 

neither, if we had both, could we know where to go with them. 
Every other way we have above a thousand miles to pass through 
the Czar's own dominions, and by ways utterly impassable, ex- 
cept by the roads made by the governor, and by the towns gar- 
risoned by his troops ; so that we could neither pass undiscovered 
by the road, or subsist any other way. Therefore it is in vain 
to attempt it." 

I was silenced, indeed, at once ; and found that they were in 
' a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the 
castle at Moscow. However, it came into my thoughts that I 
might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of 
this excellent person ; and that whatever hazard I ran, I would 
certainly try if 1 could carry him off. Upon this I took an 
occasion one evening to tell him my thoughts : I represented to 
him that it was very easy for me to carry him away, there being 
no guard over him in tiie country ; and as I was not going to 
Moscow, but to Archangel, and that I went in the fashion of 
a caravan, by which I was not obliged to lie in the stationary 
towns in the desert, but could encamp every night where I 
would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to Archangel, where 
I would immediately secure him on board an English or Dutch 
ship, and carry him off safe along with me. And as to his sub- 
sistence, and other particulars, it should be my care, till he could 
better supply himself. 

He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all 
the while I spoke ; nay, I could see in his very face, that what 
I said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment ; his colour fre- 
quently chanored, his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, 
that it might be even perceived in his countenance. Nor could 
he immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it were, 
expected what he would say to it ; but after he had paused a 
little, he embraced me, and said, ** How unhappy are we, un- 
guarded creatures as we are, that even our greatest acts of friend- 
ship are made snares to us, and we made tempters of one auother! 
My dear friend, your offer is so sincere, has such kindness in it, 
is 80 disinterested in itself, and is so calculated for my advantage,^ 
that I must have very little knowledge of the world if I did not 
both wonder at it, and acknowledge the obligation I have upon 
me to you for it. But did you believe I was sincere in what 
I have so often said to you of my contempt of the world ? Did 
you believe I spoke my very soul to you, and that I had really 
obtained that degree of felicity here, that had placed me above 
all that the world could give me, or do for me ? Did you be- 
lieve I was sincere, when I told you I would not go back, if I 
was recalled, even to be all that once I was in the court, and 
with the favour of the Czar my master? Did you believe me, 
my friend, to be an honest man, or did you think me to be a 
boasting hypocrite?" — Here he paused, as it* he would hear 



356 LIFE AND ADVENTURES FT. II. 

yfhst I would say ; but, indeed^ I soon after perceived, that he 
stopped because nis spirits were in motion ; nis heart was full 
of struggles, and he could not go on. I was, I confess, as- 
tonished at the thiug, as well as at the man, and I used some 
arguments with him to urge him to set himself free ; that he 
ought to look upon this as a door opened by Heaven for his 
deliverance, and a summons by ProvideDce, who has the care 
and disposition of all events, to do himself good, and to render 
himself useful in the world. 

He had by this time recovered himself. " How do you know, 
sir," said he, warmly, " that, instead of a summons from Heaven, 
it may not be a feint of another instrument, representing to me, 
in all its alluring colours, the show of felicity as a deliverance, 
which may in itself be my snare, and tend directly to my ruin ? 
Here I am free from the temptation of returning to my former 
miserable greatness ; there I am not sure but that all the seeds 
of pride, ambition, avarice, and luxury, which I know remain in 
my nature, may revive and take root, and in a word, again over- 
whelm me; and then the happy prisoner, whom you see now 
master of his soul's liberty, shall be the miserable slave of his 
own senses, in the fiill enjoyment of all personal liberty. Let me 
remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of 
life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at the expense of 
the liberty of my reason, and at the expense of the future hap- 
piness which now I have in my view, but shall then, I fear, 
quickly lose sight of ; for I am but flesh — a man, a mere man, 
and have passions and affections as likely to possess and over- 
throw me as any man. Oh, be not my friend and my tempter 
both together I" 

If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood 
silent, looking at him : and, indeed, lost in admiration at what 
I saw. The struggle in his soul was so great, that though the 
weather was extremely cold, it put him into a most violent 
swrat, and I found he wanted to give vent to his mind ; so I 
said a word or two, that I would leave him to consider of it, 
and wait on him again ; and then withdrew to my own apart- 
ment. 

About two hours after, I heard somebody at or near the 
door of my room, and was going to open the door ; but he had 
opened it, and came in. " My dear friend," says he, ** vou had 
almost overset me, but I am recovered : do not take it ill that I 
do not close with your offer ; I assure you, it is not for want of 
a sense of the kindness of it in you; and I came to make the 
most sincere acknowledgment of it to you ; but, I hope, I have 
got the victory over myself." 

** My lord," said I, ** I hope you are fully satisfied, that 
ou do not resist the call of Heaven." " Sir," said he, " if it 
ad been from Heaven, the same power would have influenced 



I 



CH. VIT. OF BOBINSON CRUSOE. 357 

ine to accept it ; but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from 
Heaven that I decline it ; and I have infinite satisfaction in the 
parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still, though not 
a free man." 

I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to 
him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him. 
He embraced me very passionately, and assured me he was 
sensible of that, and should always acknowledge it; and with 
that he ofiered me a very fine present of sables — too much, in- 
deed, for me to accept from a man in his circumstances ; and I 
would have avoided them, but he would not be refused. 

The next morning, I sent my servant to his lordship with a 
small present of tea, and two pieces of China damask, and four 
little wedges of Japan gold, which did not all weigh above six 
ounces, or thereabout, and were far short of the value of his 
sables, which, indeed, when I came to England, I found worth 
near 200/. He accepted the tea, and one piece of the damask ; 
also one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon it of 
the Japan coinage, and which I found he took for the rarity of it ; 
but would not take any more ; and he sent word by my servant, 
that he desired to speak with me. 

When I came to him, he told me I knew what had passed 
between us, and hoped I would not move him any more in that 
afiair ; but that, since I had made such a generous ofibr to him, 
he asked me, if I had kindness enough to offer the same to 
another person that he would name to me, in whom he had a 
great share of concern. I told him, that I could not say I in- 
clined to do so much for any one but himself, for whom I had a 
particular value, and should have been glad to have been the 
instrument of his deliverance. However, if he would please to 
name the person to me, I would give him my answer; and 
hoped he would not be displeased with me, if he was with my 
answer. He told me it was only his son, who, though I had not 
seen, yet was in the same condition with himself, and above two 
hundred miles from him, on the other side the Oby ; but that, if 
I consented, he would send for him. 

I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it. I made 
some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on 
his account ; and that seeing I could not prevail on him, I would 
shew my respect to him by my concern for his son. But these 
things are too tedious to repeat here in detail. He sent away 
the next day for his son ; and in about twenty days he came back 
with the messenger, bringing six or seven horses loaded with 
very rich furs, and which, in the whole, amounted to a very great 
value. 

His servants brought the horses into the town, but left the 
young lord at a distance till night, when he came incognito into 
our apartment, and his father presented him to me. In shorty.

■we concerted there the manner of our travelling, and every thing 
proper for the journey. 

I had bought a considerable quantity of sables (black fox- 
skins, fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich) in that 
city, in exchange for some of the goods I brought from China ; in 
particular, for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the great- 
est part here, and the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a much 
better price than I could have done at London ; and my partner, 
who was sensible of the profit, and whose business, more particu- 
larly than mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased with our 
stay, on account of the traffic we made here. 

It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place ; a 
city, I believe, little heard of in the world, and, indeed, it is so 
£blt out of the road of commerce, that I know not how it should be 
much talked of. We were now reduced to a very small caravan, 
being only thirty-two horses and camels in all, and all of them 
passed for mine, though my new guest was proprietor of eleven 
of them. It was most natural, also, that I should take more 
servants with me than I had before, and the young lord passed 
for my steward. What great man I passed for myself I know not, 
neither did it concern me to inquire. We had. th^re the worst 
and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in all the 
journey ; indeed, I call it the worst, because the way was very 
deep in some places, and very uneven in others. The best we had 
to say for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars 
and robbers to fear, and that they never came on this side the 
river Oby, or at least but very seldom ; but we found it other- 
wise. 

My young lord had with him a faithful Siberian servant, who 
was perfectly acquainted with the country, and led us by private 
roads, so that we avoided coming into the principal towns and 
cities upon the great road, because the Muscovite garrisons which 
are kept there are very curious and strict in their observation upon 
travellers, and in searching lest any of the banished persons of 
note should make their escape that way into Muscovy. By this 
means, as we were kept out of the cities, so our whole journey 
was a desert, and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, 
when we might have had very good accommodation in the cities 
on the way. This the young lord was so sensible of, that be 
would not allow us to lie abroad when we came to several cities 
on the way ; but remained himself, with his servant, in the woods^ 
and met us always at the appointed places. 

We had just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama, 
which, in these parts, is the boundary between Europe and Asia ; 
and here we thought to have seen some evident alteration in 
the people, but we were mistaken ; for as we had a vast desert 
to pass, which, by teVaiioTi, U ^^m eleven hundred' miles long in 
some places, but not «i\>ONfe Vwo "VlxsltAx^,^ t£^^<& on^t Vwet^^ ^e

I)assed it. So, till we came past that horrible place, we found very 
ittle difference between that country and the Mongul Tartary ; 
the people mostly pagans, and little better than the savages oi 
America ; their houses and towns full of idols, and their way of 
living wholly barbarous, except in the cities and the villages near 
them, where they are Christians of the Greek church. 

In passing this forest, I thought, indeed, we must (after all 
our dangers were, in our imagination, escaped, as before,) have 
been plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered by a troop 
of thieves. Of what country they were, whether the roving 
bands of the Ostiachi, a kind of Tartars, or wild people on the 
bank of the Oby, had ranged thus far ; or whether they were 
the sable-hunters of Siberia, I am yet at a loss to know ; but 
they were all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were 
at first about five-and-forty in number. They came so near to 
us as within about two musket-shot; and,, asking no questions, 
they surrounded us with their horse, and looked very earnestly 
upon us twice. At length they placed themselves just in our 
way ; upon which we drew up in a little line before our camels^ 
being not above sixteen men in all ; and being drawn up thus, 
we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant who attended his 
lord, to see who they were : his master was the more willing to 
let him go, because he was not a little apprehensive that mey 
were a Siberian troop sent out after him. The man came up 
near them with a flag of truce, and called them ; but though he 
spoke several of their languages, he could not understand a word 
they said : however, after some signs to him not to come nearer 
to them at his peril, (so, he said, he understood them to mean,) 
offering to shoot at him if he advanced, the fellow came back no 
wiser than he went ; only that by their dress, he said, he believed 
them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the Circassian hordes ; 
and that there must be more of them upon the great desert, though 
be never heard that any of them ever were seen so far north 
before. 

This was small comfort to us ; however, we had no remedy. 
There was on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile's distance, 
a little grove or clump of trees, which stood close together, and 
very near the road. I immediately resolved we would advance 
to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could there ; 
for, first, 1 considered that the trees would in a great measure 
cover us from their arrows ; and in the next place, they could 
not come to charge us in a body. It was, indeed, my old Por- 
tuguese pilot who proposed it; and who had this excellence at- 
tending him, namely, that he was always readiest and most apt 
to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger. We 
advanced immediately with what speed we could, and gained 
that little wood, the Tartars, or thieves, fox ^^ Vav^^ tnsA. -^'^sisx

US. When we came thither, we found, to our great satisfaction, 
that it was a swampy springy piece of ground ; and, on the one 
side, a very great spring of water, which, running out in a little 
rill or brook, was a little farther joined by another of the like 
bigness, and was, in short, the head or source of a considerable 
river, called afterwards the Wirtska. The trees which grew 
about this spring were not in all above two hundred, but were 
very large and stood pretty thick ; so that as soon as we got 
in, we saw ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy, unless they 
alighted and attacked us on foot. 

But to make this more difficult, our Portuguese, with inde- 
fatigable application, cut down great arms of the trees, and laid 
them hanging, not cut quite off, from one tree to another ; so 
that he made a continued fence almost round us. 

We stayed here, waiting the movements of the enemy some 
hours, without perceiving they made any motion ; when, about 
two hours before night, they came down directly upon us ; and 
though we had not perceived it, we found they had been joined 
by some more of the same, so that they were near fourscore horse, 
whereof, however, we fancied some were women. They came on 
till they were within half shot of our little wood, when we fired 
a musket without ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue, 
to know what they wanted, and bid them keep off. But as if they 
knew nothing of what we said, they came on with a double fury 
directly up to the wood-side, not im^ning we were so barri- 
caded that they could not break in. Our old pilot was our cap- 
tain, as well as he had been our engineer, and desired us not to 
fire upon them till they came within pistol-shot ; and that when 
we did fire, we should be sure to take good aim. We bade him 
give the word of command, which he delayed so long, that they 
were, some of them, within two pikes' length of us when we fired. 

We aimed so true (or Providence directed our shot so sure) 
that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded several others, as 
also several of their horses ; for we had all of us loaded our 
pieces with two or three bullets at least. 

They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated im- 
mediately about one hundred rods from us ; in which time we 
loaded our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance, we 
sallied out, and caught four or five of their horses, whose riders, 
we suppose, were killed ; and coming up to the dead, we could 
easily perceive they were Tartars, but knew not from what 
country, or how they came to make an excursion such an un- 
usual length. 

About an hour after, they attempted to attack us again, and 
rode round our little wood, to see where else they might break 
in; but finding us always ready to face them, they went ofiT again. 
So we resolved not to stir from the place for that night. 

We slept little, but spent the ^greatest part of the night in 



CH. VII. OF B0BIN80N CRTJSOB. 361 

strengthening our eittiation, and barricading the entrances into 
the wood ; and, keeping a strict watcb^ v/e waited for daylight, 
which, when it came, save us a very unwelcome discovery in- 
deed ; for the enemy, who we thought were discouraged witn the 
reception they had met with, were now increased to no less than 
three hundred, and had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents, 
as if they were resolved to besiege us ; and this little camp they 
had pitched upon the open plain, at about three quarters of a 
mile from us. We were indeed surprised at this discovery ; and 
now, I confess, I g&ve myself over for lost, and all that I had. 
The loss of my enects (though they were very considerable) did 
not lie so near me as the dioughts of falling into the hands of 
such barbarians at the latter end of my journey, after so many 
difficulties and hazards as I had gone through; and even in sight 
of our port, where we expected safety and deliverance. As for 
my partner, he was raging; he declared, that to lose his goods 
would be his ruin ; and he would rather die than be starved ; 
and he was for fighting to the last drop. 

The young lord idso was for fighting to the last; and my 
old pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist them all, in 
the situation we then were in. We spent the day in debates of 
what we should do ; but towards evening, we round that the 
number of our enemies still increased^(perhaps, as they were 
abroad in several parties for prey, the first had sent out scouts to 
call for help, and to acquaint them of the booty) ; and we did not 
know but by the morning they might be a stul greater number. 
So I began to inquire of those people we had brought from To- 
bolski, if there were no other or more private ways by which we 
might avoid them in the night, and, perhaps, either retreat to 
some town, or get help to guard us over the desert. 

The Siberian who was servant to the young lord told us, 
if we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage 
to carry us off in the night to a way that went north towards 
the Petraz, by which he made no question but we might get 
away, and the Tartars never the wiser; but he said, his lord 
had told him be would not retreat, but would rather choose to 
fight. I told him, he mistook his lord ; for that he was too wise 
a man to love fighting for the sake of it ; that I knew his master 
was brave enough by what he had shewed already ; but that he 
knew better than to desire to have seventeen of eighteen men 
fight ^Ye hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity rorced them 
to it. And that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the 
night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it. 

The young lord hayine agreed to this proposal, as soon as it 
began to be dark we kindled a fire in our little camp, which we 
kept burning, and prepared so as to make it bum all night, that 
the Tartars might conclude we were still there ; but when it was 
dark, that is to say, so as we could see the stars (for the Siberian

would not stir before), having all our horses and camels ready 
laden, we followed our new guide, who, I soon found, steered 
himself by the north star, all the country being level for a long 
way. 

By six o'clock the next morning we were gotten nearly forty 
miles, though we almost spoiled our horses. Here we found a 
Russian village, named Kinnazinskov, where we rested, and heard 
nothing of the Kalmuck Tartars that day. About two hours 
before night we set out again, and travelled till eight the next 
morning, though not quite so hard as before ; and about seven 
o'clock we passed a little river, called Kirtza, and came to a 
good large town, inhabited by Russians and very populous, called 
Ozomys. Here we were obliged to get some fresni horses, and 
having need enough of rest, we stayed five days ; and my partner 
and I agreed to give the honest Siberian, who brought us thither, 
the value of ten pistoles for his conducting us. 

In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the river Wit- 
zogda, and running into the Dwina, we were there very happily 
near the end of our travels by land, that river being navigable, 
in seven days' passage, to Archangel : from hence we came to 
Lawrenskoy, the third of July ; and providing ourselves with 
two luggage-boats, and a barge for our own convenience, we 
embarked on the seventh, and arrived all safe at Archangel the 
eighteenth ; having been a year and five months and three days 
on the journey, including our stay of eight months and odd days 
at Tobolski. 

We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the ar- 
rival of the ships ; and must have tarried longer, had not a Ham- 
burgher come m above a month sooner than any of the English 
ships ; when, after some consideration that the city of Hamburgh 
might happen to be as ^ood a market for our goods as London, 
we all tooK freight with him ; and having put my goods on board, 
it was most natural for me to put my steward on board to take 
care of them, by which means my young lord had a sufiicient 
opportunity to conceal himself. 

We sailed from Archangel the twentieth of August the same 
year ; and, after no extraordinarily bad voyage, arrived in the 
Elbe the thirteenth of September. Here my partner and I found 
a very good sale for our goods, as well those of China as the 
sables, &c. of Siberia ; and dividing the produce of our effects, 
my share amounted to 8475/. 17«. SL, notwithstanding so many 
losses we had sustained and charges we had been at; only re- 
membering that I had included in this about 600Z. worth of dia- 
monds which I had purchased at Bengal. 

Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the 
Elbe, in order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved 
to seek protection, and where he could correspond with those of 
his father's friends who were left alive. He did not part without

render it accessible to the English reading

but surpassing his works in power and depth, 



as we confess it certainly does in moral design.

The only other Edition of this celibated Romance in English was published at a

tnry, so, as might be expected, it is fttll of the

that period. This is, we think, the only 
English translation of a novel which every one 
should read, and, we donbft not. It will have an

Just Published, a Second and Improved Edition of 

^otm» antt ilfcturtjai; 

A Collection of Ballads, Sokgs, and other Poexs, with nearly One Hundred 
Engravings on Wood, by the First English Artists and Engravers. 

In Gilt Cloth, 21. 2*.; Morocco, Elegant, Two Guineas and a Half. 

The unexpectedly rapid sale of the First Issue of this admired Work has 
encouraged the Publisher to prepare a Second Edition^ with such improvements 
as he trusts will entitle it to a place among the finest Works of Art ever produced 
in this or any other country. It is admirably suited for a Gift Book. 

As the impression is limited, it is suggested that those who wish to procure 
copies for presents or other purposes, should give theilr orders to their respective 
booksellers as early as possible. 



**Gems or poe»y, tet and linked togrether 
with detisns ftill of graceful and tender feelinf. 
Every page if surrounded by a ruatie flrame- 
worli, and the margin is enriched with an 
illustration of the subject, or an ornamental 
scroll of flowery or arabesque foliage i these 
scrolls are both elegant and original." — 
Spetiator. 

" A new candidate for artistic ornament, and 
for taste and invention it is among the fore- 
most; we can only partially describe and speak 
of its designs in terms of very unqualifled 
praise. But so many and eminent artists have 
been engaged upon it, that we cannot wonder 
at the feat their united ulenu have effected. 
We may add, that the force with which every 
cut Is brought out, does infinite credit to the 
printing." — Literary Gaxetle. 

"A most beautiful volume-, and which suggests 
most forcibly the consideration. To whom shall 
I offer so charming a present ? It exhibits not 
only the most delicate specimens imaginable 
of engraving on wood, but also designs which 
do infinite credit to the taste and skill of the 
artists employed."— (xenfteman's Maganne. 

" The present volume is a specimen of ex- 
cellence in the art of wood-engraving, un- 
equalled by any work of a similar kind. Many 
of the engravings are master-pieces, from their 
beauty and finish. It is impossible to conceive 
a more splendid volume, or a more fitting pre- 
sent, while too much praise cannot be bestowed 
upon its general arrangements, independent of 
its high artistic merits. Not only must it be 
an ornament to the library of the most fasti- 
dious, but, as a work of aurt— and our readers 
know we do not use the words unadvisedly— 
it deserves immediate and extensive popa- 
Imrity."— J<iM. 



" Full of choice poetry, both of the pencil 
and the pen, finely printed on tinted paper, and 
liandsomely bound — this volume is the most 
perfect of its kind that Mr. Bums has yet pro- 
duced." — Britannia. 

" * Poems and Pictures,' published by Mr. 
Bums, than which English typography has 
produced nothing more beautifut"— Afonttiif 
Chronieie. 

** One of the most exquisite productions of 
this season of gay and glittering illustration. 
We are thankful for the pains bestowed in 
keeping it quite flree from all that could ii^ure 
the delicacy of the youthful mind, and for the 
sweet store he L«s added to it of the romantic, 
the picturesque, the beautiful, and the holy." — 
New Quaritrly. 

" This splendid volume reflects great credit, 
&e. It is a work that will outlive all the 
Annuals ; for, while it rivals them in the beauty 
of its illustrations, the literary portion of the 
page is infinitely superior to any that we 
have yet seen. It is the best presentation book 
of the season." — Oitford and Cambridge Review. 

** Mr. Bums has done real, and we hope per- 
manent, service to English art by this noble 
publication— it seems lowering to consider it 
merely as a gift- book It is speaking only 
within compass when we say that our literature 
has received a considerable acquisition in this 
volume, which exeveda in pictorial value the 
illustrated editions of Moore, Lockhart, fte., 
just as its contents are more healthy and

" The cuts are really executed In the moct

" A wotk which does honour to the age in 
which we live. The poems are worthy of the

can assure those who wish to make a present, 
that this most beautiftil work will alike do 
credit to their selection and their taste ; please

wont, the beautiful with the moral." — Era. 

" One of the most beantiital volumes which 
it has been our fortune to see. The most re- 
fined taste has presided over the selection 
of poems, while the illustrations are in the 
very highest and best style of art. It not only 
reflects credit on the publisher, but aifords a 
striking instance of the perfection to which the 
art of wood engraving has been carried."— 
English Review.

we have seen in that brandi of the art. Both 
the mind and the eye are equally gratified by 
this unique volume."— /oAn Bu:l.

# mere book ; they are depicted with a softness 
•■d delicacy whiefa formerly could only be 
attained by copper or aCeel. The work is most 
elegantly got up, and forms a splendid orna- 
ment for the drawing-room table, and compa- 
nioa for all persons of taste." — BelPs Messenger. 

** This illustration of * Poems and Pictures* 
surpasses, indeed, in beauty and excellence all 
the competitors we liave seen ; it stands un- 
rivalled as a graeefol and beautiful present. 
Taste and judgment, sentiment and passion, 
fancy and feeling, imagination and intellect, 
have all wherewith to luxuriate upon." —

** What have we in place [of the Annuals] ? 
Why, the devotion of some of the highest 
eflTorts of Bngliah Art to the illustration of 
some of die finest compositions in our lan- 
guage. Tiw superb vidume before us is a noble 
specimen of this beneficial change. Here we 
have some of the most spirit-stirring ballads, 
songs, and poems of our land, (with a few 
translations,) illustrated by tlie first artists 
that our country can produce. The illu»tra- 
tioos are, we think, taken altogether, the finest 
set of engravings on wood yet produced in this 
country. Among the artists, we find Cope, 
Dyce, Creswick, Horsley, Redgrave, Tenniel, 
&c. &c.— names familiar to the public by their 
exquisite crntributions to our metropolitan ex- 
hibitions, and to the great Art competitions of 
the last lew years. The volume is most taste- 
fully bound and gilt ; and is, altogether, a first- 
class work of art, and homage of the pencil to 
the soul-fraught inspirations of the pen."— 
lUutlrated Aews. 



This unique volume is splendidly printed in square 8vo, on toned paper 
prepared for the purpose. Price in cloth gUt, 2 guineas; or in morocco elegant
