THE
LIFE and ADVENTURES
OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
W' I T H permission, reader, I
will relate to you the par-
ticulars of my life, and as but few
persons, I fancy, ever experienced
more difficulties, it will probably
be in my power to entertain you*
I was born in the year 1632, at
York; my father, Mr. Crusoe,
having acquired a very consider-
able fortune as a merchant, chose
that City to spend the residue of
his life comfortajbly in; but alas,
how imperfect is worldly happi-
ness! when we fancy ourselves at
the very eve of posseslioa, up fiam
6 The Life and Adventures
an unexpected something, which
embitters the whole; for good
foul, he had, with the highest: re-
putation to himself, surmounted all
the difficulties in trade. Happy
to fee me growing up promiffing-
ly, when on a sudden, over all was
spread the most: horrid gloominess;
he discovered my resolution of go-
ing to sea. One morning he cal-
led me into his chamber, and with
tears in his eyes, expostulated with
me very freely on the subject,
*c What can possess thee, my child,
said he, for wishing to leave thy
native Kingdom, depend on it,
travel where you will, by land or
bf water, never will you put foot
into any country where tjge bles-
sings of life Ire more gerierouify
dispersed among all ranks of pec*
pie, and their lives and liberties
snore preserved; or into a climate
more adapted to thy constitution,
than is enjoyed in the very coun-
try you live so unhappily in, and
which you now acknowledge to
me you have resolved upon leav-
ing. If the. advice of a father,
said he, is in your opinion worth
following, by all meansbaniihfrom
your mind luc-h a foolish |cheme;
you must be laughed at fork by
the whole world, as a l?^i wanting
capacity; nay, yourself must con-
fess the idea preposterous; such a
resolution is mad ness in you,, which
possibly might be prudence in ano-
ther lad.; for instance, was:.you
the son of a poor maa^ alod ha^L-got
into bad company wherein your
character had iulfered^Ji that in-
stance the resolution of going into
strange countries, with the intent
of retrieving your character and
fortune would be commendable;
butasyou are by my industry, plac-
ed above the probability of want,
and I am convinced you are as much
respected by your acquaintance as
ever boy was, what can possess
thee to think of leaving such hap-
piness; and take my word, child,
if you persist in the resolution, //
'will bring on you many an aching
heart, which words I had too much
reason to remember: However, I
was obstinate, and the first ILipthat
failed from Hull carried me to I on-
don> I was then about nineteen
years of age, and being in compa-
ny with some captains, I said in
conversation, it was my desire to
see the World; one of them an-
swered he would take me with
him, passage free, if I chose to go
his voyage, which was to Guinea;
I readily accepted the offer, and
in about seven days the ship sailed-
We had very boisterous weather
from the time we left the Downs,
and at last was taken prisoner by a
Moorlih Rover, who carried us in-
to Sallee; the cruelty 1 experi-
enced in this country made me re-
solve to attempt an escape the fiprst
opportunity, but it was full tfcrie
years before I had the least chance
of effecting it. About that time
our governor coming into the cells
one morning, said, he wanted soin6
fish for a great entertainment, and
if either^ of the European laves
understood the art of ftihing^ lie
should have the liberty of going
with the negro and his boy, in a
pinnace; now, as it was always
my favourite diversion, I answer-
ed, if he would suffer me tOyg6, I
had no doubt of bringing home
double the quantity of fiih he want*
ed* Me consented, and while the
negro and his lad were getting the
boat ready, I was busy in carrying
in provisions, thinking this no bad
opportunity - for me to escape-
The boat w-as presently got rea-
dy, away we sailed, %id at the-
distance of two leagues from the
shore, the old negro prepared to
Hlh, and stooping over the side of
the pinnace to place the net pro-
perly, I suddenly took hold of his
legs and1 threw him headlong into
the sea; then taking up one of the
muskets (which were always kept
loaded in the boat) I levelled it at
his head, and vowed that unless

he immediately turned round and
swam towards the shore (for he
was attempting to gfli into the
boat again) I would biowhisbrains
out, and 4s he was M excellent
swimmer, IJknew it was inhispoTy-
er to reach it. The negro find-
ing me resolute, turned towards
the shore, and immediately I turn-
ed to the hoy that was fleering the
ix>at, and toldhim, that if he would
obey my orders, he mould fare as
I did, which he agreed to, and we
now Hood out top sea. As there
was a very bristc wind, I presently
found myself out of the Emperor
of Morocco's dominions. Next
day as the boat was sailing under
the more of some Country I was
a stranger to, of a sudden we heard
a dreadful howling near us, I must
qonfess I was much frightened, but
more so on seeing a monstrous
l*eastdaih himself into the water,
and swim towards us; when he
was within about ten yards of the
boatj I levelled my gun at his head
and fired, whv h must I think ve-
ry near have killed him, as he was
a considerable time in returning to
the snore.
The negro boy advised me to
turn the boat and follow him, but
as we had so providentially escap-
ed being devoured, I thought it
not proper to run into more danger
than was necessary, so I ordered
him to keep his course, and I di-
rectly loaded my gun again, for
there was plenty of ammunition
in the boat; we now feltthe want
of nothing but fresh water, and
that article we were horridly dis*
tressed for. I was exceedingly
pleased with the lad, for he chear-
fully offered to go on shore with
a great pitcher, and try to find
some, but by no means w<iuld I
suffer that till we had made the
boat fast and I was ready to go
along with my two guns; we tra-
velled full a mile up the country,
and at last was fortunate enough
to meet with an excellent spring;
we were filling the pitcher, when
on a sudden the lad cried,/^, mas-
ser,Jee, I turned round, and at a-
bout fifty yards distance, under a
tree, fat the greatest lion my eyes
ever beheld, just on thef point of
darting at us; my guns I had laid
on the grafs, but instantly snatched
up the nearest, fired, and found I
had wounded him- It was lucky
I had two guns with me, else I
had never lived to have related
these strange adventures, for in-
Head of the Lion running away,
after I wounded him, he jumped
from the tree in the greatest an(-
ger, towards us, and I had but just
time to level the second gun/which
dispatched him.

I was very thankful to God for
my wonderful escape, and having
found what we came onshore for,
intended to make the utmost haste
to the boat, bnt the lad pointing
to the Lion's coat, and to my bo-
dy, pnt it in my head to skin him,
which we did in two hours, and
got safe on board the boat. I
found the ikin, when dry, exceed-
ing warm-iind comfortable, it last-
ed me many years, indeed in the
moment I am writing these adven-
tures, part of that very Lion's
skin, my waistcoat is made of. We
now kepf failing on, quite ignorant
where going to, till the most dread-
ful storm surrounded us, surely,
which ever man beheld; in a few
minutes the Iky turned black as
night, though half an hour before
the fun told me it was noon,the sea
rolled mountains high, every in-
stant we expected to be our last,
one moment we were lifted on the
top of a wave five titfie$ higher
than St. Paul's, and the next
plunged as low. At last the poor
boy, quite exhausted with fatigue,
was waihed overboard and lost. I
was too much agitated myself to
admit a thought respecting hiin,
for in a few minutes afterwards
the boat went to the bottom. The
first thing I recollect wras lying on
the ihore, and seeing the water
roll towards me, and taking me
about a mile into the sea ; another
wave would bring me on ihore,
and leave me there a minute or
two; then another took me out
to sea again; in this manner was
I suspended betweenlifeand death,
till a very large wave driving into
more, carried me so far on the
sands, that the next did not touch
me, and the storat abating, there
was I left, till by degrees I reco-
vered the use of my reason, and
the first act: I applyed to it, was to
thank God my life was saved, in a
case wherein there was some mi-
nutes before scarce any room to
hope.
Tho' I had so wonderfully es-
caped the dangers of the ocean, I
now had the fear of wild beasts be-
fore me, a proof this life is intend-
ed only as a life of trouble; for I
am fully persuaded, none living,
let their fortunes, friends, health,
&c. be ever so extensive and valu-
able, can truly assert they are now
perfectly happy-
When I had recovered strength
to rise, I walked into the country,
and had got about three miles from
the sea, without seeing any thing
but goats, hares, and an immense
number ofwild fowls, when reach-
ing a very high hill, I there had
the opportunity of viewing the
country. I found it to be an I-
fland about ten miles long, five
broad, and very woody; a hun-
dred gloomyideas presented them-
selves at this instant, I began to
fancy Providence preserved me
from the dangers of the water,on-
ly to torture me with a more
cruel and tedious death; but this
reflection I was angry at, so I
jumped from the ground,and with
a thought full of industry, said,
God has done such wonderful
kindnesses for me, it is infamous
and ungrateful in me to complain;
here are fowls, goats, and hares
in abundance, and it is strange if
I cannot hunt for food; all I have
to pray for is, that it is not inha-
bited by wild creatures, who will
devour me, which thank God was
not the cafe-
No human creature but my-
self was on the Island, or any of-
fensive animal to molest me. On
this Island I lived fifteen years,sub-
sisting the whole time on milk (for
I had caught some young goats and
brought 'em up tame) and what
fowls I took in the woods by lay-
ing springs and traps in the night.
One day about noon, going into
the woods after some of my bird
traps, I thought I mould have
funk to the ground through fear,
every joint of me trembled at the
fight, it was the print of a man's
foot, Good God! O ! what did I
see, I was confident it was not the
mark ofmyown, for besides it be-
ing a deal larger, I had not been
in that part for a month, and that
print was quite freih, I ran like
lightning to my home, which was
a kind of a cave, overgrown with
trees, and threw myself down on
a parcel of dry leaves, that for
some years had served me as a bed,
there I lay three days and nights,
without a morsel of food or sleep,
so distressed at discovering there
was on the Island, more human
creatures than myself, who I fear-
ed would murder me; hunger at
last obliged me to look for food,
and surely never poor creature
ventured out of his hiding place,
so fearfully as me out of my cave.
I was terrified at every leaf
that moved, but having no farther
reason to fancy my fears well
grounded, I concluded the mark
was from my own foot, so was to-
lerably easy : but soon afterwards
I was thoroughly convinced of the
contrary, for ranging through the
woods as was my usual custom,
for food, I discovered one day five
canoes full of savages, within half
a league of the shore, and making
to it as fast as they possibly could.
I secreted myself near enongh to
discover what they were about,
and found the canoes landed all
the Indians, but two of them were
chained together, who cried pite-
oufly; they presently made a
large fire, cut the throat of one of
the two, broiled his fleih on t£ie
fire, and eat it; never did I be-
hold a sight which filled me with
horror equal to this, however
shocked as I was, prudence kept
me quiet. When they had eat as
much of the poor creature as they
chose, they wrere preparing to dis-
patch the other, but just as they
had unbound him, and going to
give the finiihing stroke, by the
greatest agility I ever beheld, he
flipped under their arms, and ran
into the woods; he made towards
the place where I lay concealed,
and on that account I was alarm-
ed for my own safety; three of
the savages I saw follow him, and
as I knew nothing but a stout re-
sistance on my part could be of ser-
vice, I took pains to cut a* good
cudgel, and have it m my hand
to receive them; presently the
savage who was to have been
roasted, came running quite out
of breath, he was ready to die at
the sight of me, thinking he had
only run from one danger to ano-
ther, so endeavoured to avoid me,
but that I prevented; he then fell
on the ground, and taking hold
of one of my feet put his head to
the earth and my foot upon it.
This I considered as a token of
his wish to be my servant; it tur-
ned out so, and a more faithful
diligent fellow never lived; his
pursuers soon gave him up, and
returned to their own country.
Ever since I left England, eve-
ry day I had made a notch in a
piece of wood to act: as my alma-
isack, by that means I was infor-
med, even in this melancholy I-
(land, which was the Sabbath, and
most part of that day on my knees
I spent in prayer. This wooden
almanac now told me it was Fri-
day the savages came, so having
no other name at hand, I chris-
tened my new servant Friday, I
soon taught him to nnderstand me,
and as he was a very industrious
fellow, I now lived with less trou-
ble than before I had him, for he
easily killed game enough for us
both. In this state five years pas-
sed without having another visit
from the Barbarians; at that time
we discovered several canoes mak-
ing towards our more, Friday said
he was sure they were on the
same business again, so I ordered
him to fetch two of the stoutest
clubs from my cave, and said,
"now Friday will you stand by
me and help to prevent those hor-
rid savages from accomplishing
tnejr cruel purpose," be quickly
answered, "Yes indeed, Maffer,
yesy indeed, Maffer, me will, me
will." As I knew the man to
be honest, I could depend upon
him, so I resolved to do all in my
power to prevent the {cene they
were going to exhibit. When
Friday returned, the savages were
ii;ot out of their canoes, so I found
no time4 was to be lost; away we
ran, each having an excellent cud-
gel, and placed ourselves behind a
very large tree, entirely unseen,
and at the distance of about fifty
yards, five prisoners were chained,
and eight savages pul I":~ «* v * t
of the canoes, and placing them
in a row, I saw the fire kindling,
6C now, said I, Friday, do your best
and support me," and then rallied
upon them with the courage and
strength of lions; in less than five
minutes fix of the wretches lay
dead upon the sands, and the other
two leaping into the sea, no doubt
were drowned. I then turned to
the five poor souls who flood trem-
bling, and expected me to Serve
them as I had the others; but pre-
sently I convinced them of my
friendship. I now thought poor
Friday was really distracted, till I
learned his joy was occasioned by
the sight of his father, who was
•ne of the five we happily saved.

The other four were Spaniards,
ail prisoners taken in war a few
days before by the savage nation,
and their practice was to eat all
those who fell into their hands.
We were now seven in number,
arid very fortunately an En glim
Merchant slip, homeward bound,
was by contrary winds drove near
our Island; we made a large fire
in the woods one night to con-
vince the crew of the ihip the I-
fland was inhabited; next morning
twenty sailors came on ihorewell
armed, we soon convinced them
of our friendship, and treated them
with the best the Island produced;
in return they generously took us
on board to Liverpool, from
thence I went to York, but was
greatly shocked at the news I re-
ceived; my rambling disposition
I found had brought ray dear fa-
ther and mother to their graves;
they both died soon after I left
Hull.
I cannot express the agony it
caused in me; I considered myself
entirely as the author of their
deaths; and though property suf-
ikientis left for me to live like a
gentleman, I cannot have peace
to enjoy it; and at t^iis moment I
really believe .myself the most mi-
serable object; Jiving, and heartily
I repent giving way to the restless
disposition which made me leave
my parents; as, from that hour I
date all the subsequent misfor-
tunes of my life.
