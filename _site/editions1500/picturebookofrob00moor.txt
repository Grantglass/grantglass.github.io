THE PICTURE BOOK OF 

ROBINSON CRUSOE 

By E. A. VERPILLHUX 

The Text Adapted from 
Daniel Defoe's Story 

By ELIZABETH C. MOORE 

A new Robinson Crusoe, this 
time for the much younger gener- 
ation. The hundreds of pages of 
text, which hold the reading age 
spellbound, have been hard going 
for the younger boys who love to 
play "desert island," and want 
to know, very briefly, all about 
Crusoe. 

This book shows all the things 
these real boys want to know: how 
the island looked, how Crusoe built 
his stockade, just what his new 
clothes were, how he fought the 
cannibals. You see the dramatic 
finding of Friday, you see him 
helping Crusoe with the new boat, 
you see the exciting fights in the 
dark when they captured the ship 
that took them home again. 

Only a very experienced illus- 
trator could have handled this old 
tale in such a fresh and dramatic 
way. Mr. Verpilleux has made a 
hero no youngster can resist, and 
has drawn scenes of jungle, sea, 
and camp, with great artistry. 
Only one who knew them, could 
picture the spires of York for the 
opening page so beautifully. 

A brief, simple text has been 
written by Mrs. Moore, who used 
to tell the story, much in this way, 
to her own son when he was six 
or seven years old. She has taken 
a fine, vivid, story-telling tone; 
every father and mother who reads 
out loud will appreciate it.

NEW YORK = THE MACMILLAN COMPANY = 1931 




Once upon a time, nearly three hundred years ago, a boy named 
Robinson Crusoe was living in England. His home was in the city 
of York, that ancient and beautiful town from which our "New 
York" gets its name. You would think that he would have been too 
fond of the high, square towers of the great York Minster, and the 
quaint houses with the graceful storks flying overhead, ever to want 
to leave his city. But this was just what he did want to do. Before 
he was well grown he told his father that he was going off to sea. 

Mr. Crusoe didn't like the idea a bit. He told Robinson — 
whom he probably called Robin, because he and his wife were very 
fond of their boy — that a sailor's life was a hard one, especially 
for a lad who had not been trained to sailors 1 work. It was dangerous, 
too. Ships that went on long voyages often got blown ofT their 
courses and were many months reaching home again. Sometimes, 
even, they were wrecked in great storms, and the men on them were 
never heard from again. 

All this Robinson's father told him over and over again, to try 
to make the boy forget his mad idea, because the Crusoes had already 
4 



lost their other son, who had been a soldier and was killed in battle; 
and they wanted to keep Robin at home with them. Finally his 
father just said firmly, "I will not allow you to go. Your mother 
and I will be happier if you stay here and learn to be a lawyer." 

But Robinson still kept on thinking about the sea, and talking to 
everybody he could find that had ever gone voyaging on a ship. And 
then, one day, he ran away — disobeyed his parents and went down to 
Hull, a seacoast town where he knew he should find ships. He had 
plenty of money with him, for his father was both wealthy and 
generous, so he thought he would be all right. 

Now, any other boy would probably have asked to be taken on 
board some ship as a real, working sailor, to earn his own way and 
learn to do all the queer things that sailors have to do. For in those 
days, you must remember, ships were not run by steam, with the big 
engines doing most of the work. Steam engines hadn't yet been 
invented. A ship then had to depend on the wind that blew against 
its sails and made it fly through the water. And if it was a big ship 
it had to carry a good many men to set the sails so that they caught 
whatever wind there was, and to raise and lower the anchor, and to 
move the rudder back and forth to make the ship turn around. 

If a ship got to a place where there wasn't any wind it would 
just have to drift with the current until the wind blew again. And 
then, sometimes, if the wind blew in the wrong direction it would 
send the ship toward the shore, where perhaps there was no good 
landing place with plenty of deep water; and then it would be blown 
on a rock or on to the sandy shallows, and be smashed all to pieces. 

Now Robin had heard all about such shipwrecks, but he probably 
thought, "Oh, that sort of thing will never happen to me> and I shall 
have a fine time going all over the world and seeing everything!" 

Well, that sounded all right, but Robin did not know what was 
really going to happen to him before many more years. Indeed, he 
did not dream even of the disaster that was to overtake him in just a 
few days' time, before he had so much as left English shores. And so he 
went on board a ship at Hull, sailing as a passenger and paying his way 
because he didn't relish the idea of the hard work that sailors have to do. 



This first voyage of Robinson Crusoe's did not last long. Less 
than a week later, after the ship had gone around the coast of England 
a little distance, and was putting into Yarmouth harbor, a violent 
storm rose, and the beating wind and rain threw the ship back and 
forth amid the high waves. Robin, you may be sure, was badly 
frightened, in addition to being seasick. Pretty soon some of the 
water got inside the ship — "A leak !" the men cried — and Robin had 
to help them in trying to pump it out. Though they all worked hard, 
the water kept getting ahead of them and they finally realized that 
the ship was going to founder. 
. "Founder?" asked Robin. "What is that?" 

"Sink, boy ! She's going down ! " cried the man next to him at 
the pumps. "We'll have to take to the boats." 

Robin hurried to get into one of the smaller boats that were slung 
at the side, and soon he and all the men were being lowered into the 
angry sea, to make their way as best they could into Yarmouth harbor. 
There the townspeople were waiting to give the shipwrecked men food 
and shelter and money so that they could get home. 

One of the crew, an older man who had taken an interest in 
Robin, advised him to go straight back to his father in York. "I do not 
think," he said wisely, "that you were meant to be a sailor." 

But Robin would not listen to him. He had made up his mind 
to go to sea, and go to sea he would, storms or no storms. 

"You are a headstrong and stubborn boy," his friend went on, 
"and I do not doubt that you will run into trouble all your life. Some 
day you will remember all that your father and I have told you." 

And Robin did. Many a time, in the years that followed, he wished 
that he had stayed safely in York. But the adventures that befell him 
make such a fine and exciting story that boys and girls for many years 
have enjoyed reading about them, as they were set down afterward 
by a writer named Daniel Defoe in the book called "The Life and 
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe." 

By this time Robin was nearly twenty. He decided to go to 
London and perhaps find there a ship bound for Africa to trade with 
the natives. He had some money, and his plan was to buy in London 




a lot of knives and cloth and trinkets of all kinds, and take these to sell 
to the Moors, who lived up in the corner of Africa on the edge of the 
Atlantic Ocean. His first trip was very successful. He came back 
with more money than he had ever had before, and he was quite 
proud of himself ! This was exactly what he liked best, and he thought 
to himself that his father and his friend had been wrong, after all. 

But on his second voyage the ship he was on was attacked by the 
Moorish pirates who roamed around the Mediterranean and out into 
the ocean. The English captain and Robin and the crew resisted 
bravely, but they were defeated. Their ship was seized and all the 
men were taken prisoner and carried back to Morocco to be the 
slaves of the Moors. 

This was something Robin had not bargained for, and he was 
terribly unhappy. He did not mind so much the hard work he had 
to do for his Moorish master — who was, after all, not a cruel man — 
but he hated being a slave and having to give up his grand dreams of 
sailing all over the world. How could he get away — escape from 
this slavery ? 

You may be sure that this problem never left his mind for long at 
any time during the two or three years that he spent in Morocco. He 
reflected, of course, that he might have been much worse off than he 
was. The country he was living in was strange and interesting and 

7 



pleasant. All around him were sights and sounds that delighted his 
boyish curiosity. Every day he watched the dark Moors in their queer 
dress, and listened to their unintelligible talk. He saw long trains of 
ungainly camels winding their way off toward the southern desert, 
laden with huge piles of traders' goods. 

His happiest hours were those he spent sailing his master's boat 
when they went fishing along the coast. On his two trips from 
England he had been sensible enough to learn from the sailors some- 
thing about how to manage a boat, and how to keep it on its course 
by using the compass and watching the stars; and this knowledge he 
was now increasing every day. Such journeys with his master took 
him out on the wide waters again, and he became in time a pretty 
good sailor. But they made him a little unhappy, too — he so wanted 
to go free, and be his own master again, and sail all over the seas of 
the whole wide world ! 

Then one day his opportunity came. His master called him and 
said that he had decided to fit out the boat for longer trips. Robin, 
and the little negro boy Xury who helped him, were to build some 
sort of shelter of canvas over the boat, and stock it with plenty of food 
and water. So Robin and Xury set to work, and presently they had 
the boat so well supplied that their master could go away in it for a 
week at a time if he chose. 

But that was not Robin's idea. "Xury," he said when they had 
finished, "who is going to use all these things?" 

'The master," answered the little boy promptly. 

"You are wrong," retorted Robin, and he laughed. "It is you 
and I, Xury, that these things are going to serve. You and I are going 
to escape — in this very boat; go so far away that our master will never 
find us! He is asleep now, and will not want us for several hours. 
This is the very time to start." 

So off they went, big Robin and little black Xury in the boat, and 
they sailed through the pleasant Atlantic waters for miles and miles, 
until they had passed all the country that belonged to the Moors. Once 
the little boy asked, "Where are we going, and what are we going to 
do when we get there?" 
8 




ROBIN AND XURY 



Robin only looked very grown-up and wise, and said, "That we 
shall see about when the time comes. 1 ' To tell the truth, Robin had 
no very clear idea what he was going to do, but he didn't intend to 
let Xury suspect it ! 

However, he was lucky for once. The weather was good, and 
the little boat went dashing along finely. Presently they found they 
were running short of drinking water, so they put into a little cove 
they spied, so as to hunt a spring. When they had filled up their jars 
and put out to sea again, Xury caught sight of sails not far away. 
' ' Look — a big boat ! " h e cried. 

As soon as Robin made out that it really was a ship, he said, "We 
must persuade the captain of that vessel to take us aboard, for we cannot 
go much farther without meeting dangers, and we shall be much better 
off on a large boat. ' ' So then he hung up on their mast a gayly colored 
flag from the chest, so as to attract the attention of the ship's crew. 
And sure enough, it was seen within a very few minutes, and the ship 
turned and came toward them. 

After Robin and Xury were taken on board they explained who 
they were, and Robin was delighted to find that it was an English 
vessel, trading between the coast of Africa and Brazil, over on the other 
side of the Atlantic in South America. True, he did not particularly 
want to go to South America right now — he would rather have gone 
home to York for a visit, if only to let his family know that he was 
alive and safe. Still, a trip to Brazil with a captain who was his own 
countryman was better than either staying as a slave in Morocco or 
wandering down the African coast in a little open boat! 

What astonished and distressed him, however, was to learn that 
this vessel was a "slaver," that is, a boat whose captain seized the poor 
African negroes and carried them off to slavery in Brazil. But Robin 
soon got over this feeling, for, after all, he lived in the seventeenth 
century when people's ideas were very different from ours today — when 
slavery was taken as a matter of course, because men had not yet learned 
to realize how dreadful it is to make slaves of other human beings, and 
buy and sell them as if they were just tables and chairs. 

So Robin soon got used to the idea that the ship was filled, down in 

10 



the part called the hold, with bewildered, frightened blacks from the 
jungles of Africa, being taken into the same kind of captivity that he 
had hated so when he had to endure it himself in Morocco. Indeed, by 
the time the ship had reached port in Brazil, Robin found no difficulty 
at all in consenting to the captain's offer to buy Xury from him. Robin 
knew that Xury would be well treated by the captain, and the sale gave 
him enough money to live on after he landed. 

Robinson Crusoe was now a fine, tall young man, strong and 
hardy and able to look after himself. He decided to become a planter, 
which is something like what we call a farmer. He raised great 
quantities of tobacco on the big plantation that he bought, and in a 
few years became a rich man. 

Then came a time when he felt that he just had to go back to 
England, if only for a visit. He was getting a little homesick, you see, 
and he realized that his parents must be worrying about him, since they 
had had no word from him in several years, and indeed probably thought 
him dead long ago. So when he heard of a vessel that was shortly to 
start northward for England, he decided to sail on her. First he put 
his plantation into the hands of honest and capable agents, who would 
manage it for him in his absence and would send the profits on it to 
their main office in Spain, where Robinson Crusoe could get the 
money when convenient. But, though the business prospered, it was 
to be many a long year — nearly thirty, in fact — before its owner laid 
hands on that money. 

And soon you shall see why. For now comes the real beginning 
of Robinson Crusoe's great adventure. 

The ship made a safe voyage for some days along the coast of South 
America, when suddenly a terrific hurricane arose, driving it many 
miles westward off its course. The captain said that the nearest land was 
the coast of Brazil, not far from the wide mouth of the great Orinoco 
River, and that they had better lower the two boats that the ship 
carried, and try to reach land in these. One boat, however, was 
already smashed to bits by the wind and the high waves, so they all had 
to start off in the other. Just as they were leaving the ship, the captain 
spied land not far off — an island, perhaps, he said. 

11 




But alas for the little boat — the angry seas overturned it at once 
and the men were thrown out into the water. Of all his shipmates, 
Robinson Crusoe never again saw one, for he was the only man saved. 
Battling with the great waves that poured over him, he gradually made 
his way to the sandy shore, bumped and torn by the sharp rocks in 
the shallows. 

Presently, more dead than alive, he found himself lying on the 
sand. He rose and looked about him. There, a mile or two away, 
he saw the poor shipwrecked vessel, her nose poked into a sand bar, 
her upper parts all torn away, the furious sea still lashing at her as if it 
didn't want to leave a single spar whole. 

What was this land that he had reached ? Part of South America, 
where he might find friendly aid, or only a barren island inhabited by 
savages who would kill him ? He drew a long breath and felt himself 
all over, to see whether he was injured. He walked a little — then 
ran — and found himself safe and whole, and at last free from that 
horrible sea! You might think that he would be sorry for himself in 
those first few moments — but no. He was so thankful to be alive that 
he felt happier than ever before in his life. 
12 



He was terribly tired, of course, and hungry, and though he was 
soaked through he had no nice warm clothes to change into. There 
were probably dangerous wild beasts around, and he had no weapon 
but the knife in his belt. But as he walked briskly up and down trying 
to get dry, he came across a nice little spring of fresh water, and after 
he had had a drink he felt better. Then he climbed up into a tall tree 
to sleep until morning. 

Can you imagine how he felt when he waked up? It was a 
bright, sunshiny day, and he could see the ship clearly now. So 
he said to himself, "Why shouldn't I try to get out to her and 
perhaps find some things to make myself comfortable? Maybe 
I'll have to live in this place for a long time before any ship comes 
to rescue me." 

It was a pleasant enough place, this gently curving shore, the 
sloping hill behind it covered with trees and plants and flowers. But 
still there was no sign of animals or men. Probably he was the only 
human being for miles around. Well, that simply meant that he 
would have to rely on himself. 

When he reached the beach nearest the sand bar he waded 
out and swam to the ship, climbed into it by a rope and prowled 
about looking for useful things. The fore part was tipped down 
into the sand, and was full of water. But in the after part things 
were fairly dry. "Well," he said to himself, "there is plenty of 
stuff here that I can use, but I shall have to make a raft if I am to 
get it ashore." 

Finding rope and timber, he quickly lashed together a strong, large 
raft and let it down over the side. And now that he was actually doing 
something he felt better already — he even whistled! Now, what to 
put on it? From the provision chests came bread and cheese, some 
pieces of dried goats' flesh, a little wheat — which in those days was 
called American corn — some wine, and a carpenter's chest full of good 
tools. Oh, what a find that was! It held just what he needed for 
building himself a house. Now some bags of shot, a couple of guns, 
and a cask or two of powder — for he must shoot animals if he was 
to have food. 

13 




Getting back to land on this heavily loaded raft was not very easy, 
for he had only two broken oars to paddle along with, but the wind 
was blowing toward the island and the tide was running in. A little 
14 




stream offered a good landing-place, and gradually he worked the raft 
toward it, and soon had his precious stores high and dry. 

Then he started to explore for a good place to pitch his camp. 
When he reached the top of the hill he saw that he was on an island, 
with no houses or people in sight. Alone! Well, there was no use 
wasting time in being sorry for himself. He must get to work building 
some sort of shelter. But first, he had better make another trip out 
to the boat and get more things, because a storm might come up at 
any time and smash the ship to pieces. And indeed, he went out 
many times in the next few days, each time bringing back useful 
articles for the little camp he was making, and reflecting how lucky 
he was that he had been cast ashore so near the vessel. 

Soon he had so many plans buzzing around in his head that every 
morning when he woke he could hardly wait to set to work. Up went 
a big canvas tent — in went a pile of blankets for a bed, and boxes full 

15 




HE STARTED TO BUILD — 




A HIGH FENCE OF STRONG STAKES 



of clothes and tools and food. Once, as he stood looking at all his 
treasures, he said, " Here I have been on this island thirteen days and 
have made thirteen trips. I verily believe that if that ship would stay 
upright long enough I could bring her ashore piece by piece!' 1 and 
he laughed and turned again to his carpentering. 

Around the circular grass-grown spot that he had picked for his 
camp he started to build a high fence made of two rows of strong 
stakes driven deep into the ground. He had no door nor gate to this 
barricade, but instead got in and out by a high ladder that he dragged 
in after him each night. 

Don't you think that Robinson Crusoe was ingenious? He was 
fast learning how to protect himself, and how to work for himself, and 
was certainly a far more sensible young man than he had been when 
he left home. And he was enjoying himself more too, now that he 
had to stop, many times a day, and ask himself, " Now how on earth 
can I manage that? Here is a difficulty — how can I get around it 
with what I have?" 

One day, when he was out with his gun hunting food, he found 
a mother goat in a simple little trap he had set, and when he got her 
free decided to take her home for the sake of the milk she would give. 
As he carried her along, over his shoulder, up trotted her baby kids, and 
so they went along too; and presently he had quite a flock of friendly, 
tame goats in his enclosure. A few days later he caught a parrot, which he 
took home and called Polly. Already he had a dog and two cats that 
he had found on the ship, so they were a very happy family together. 

The weeks and months went on, and still he saw no other human 
being. But he did not mind that, because he had company and he was 
busy making things or out exploring every minute. For a while he 
was a little worried about food, because. what he had brought ashore 
from the ship would not last forever, and he must use it sparingly. But 
he caught plenty of fish and turtles — and how good that turtle meat 
was! — and in time learned which of the birds and other wild things 
on his island were good to eat. " But how queer it is," he thought, 
"to be eating game and fish whose names I don't know! And wouldn't 
I enjoy a good slice of bread and butter right now?" 

18 




That set him to thinking. Was there any way he could get it? 
Butter — could he make his goats 1 milk into butter, in any way? As 
for bread, that was easier. He had quite a lot of wheat grains that he 
could plant, and when they grew up he would have more wheat that 
he could grind into flour for bread. He didn't know exactly what 
he could use to grind it with, but that problem would come later. 
First, plant it. So he did. 

But you see Robinson Crusoe did not know anything about 
farming, having grown up in a city, so he made mistakes. The spading 
of the ground went all right, and he sowed his seeds. But, as he con- 
cluded later, he must have picked out the wrong time of year to sow, 
because none of his wheat came up. Then he was glad that he had 
used only a part of the wheat. Try again, at another season, with some 
more. That was better — this time the little shoots came up, and grew, 
and presently he had fine stalks of wheat in his little plantation. 

He had had some trouble devising a way of harrowing the ground 
after the sowing. Having no rake nor harrow, he had to invent a 

19 



substitute, and this was a heavy bough of a tree, which he dragged 
over the earth, scratching it up loosely. 

By the time his wheat was ripe, he had a plan for grinding it. He 
hollowed out a thick section of log, leaving the bottom in, so that 
he had something like a big bowl. Then he cut a thick stick into a 
pestle, to pound the wheat with. So, grinding and pounding the 
grains in this mortar, he got some flour. It took him a long time, 
and, as he admitted to himself, "It isn't very good flour!' 1 Still, 
it would make bread; and next time he would know how to go 
about the job better. For of course he saved some of this new wheat 
for next year's planting. 

Then came the problem of finding something to keep the flour 
in. Many of his belongings he could keep all right in the baskets 
that he had taught himself to weave from grasses and reeds, but the 
flour and certain other foods ought to be protected from the damp 
and from insects. Jars — that was what he needed — big, fat, earthen- 
ware jars with lids. But there had been none on the ship, and how was 
he to make any? He knew that you needed clay, and that after you 
had your jar molded into the right shape you must dry it in the sun 
or bake it in a fire. Well, that sounded easy, but it wasn't so easy 
when he got at it. 

He found some clayey earth not far off, and mixed it with water 
and started to shape it roughly. It made him feel like a little boy 
again, back in York making mudpies! When it got to look some- 
thing — not very much, but something — like a jar, he sat back and 
inspected it. But alas! — when he had dried it in the sun, it all fell 
to pieces when he picked it up! He realized that there had been 
something wrong with the way he made it. Well, there was nothing 
to do but try again. And you wouldn't believe how many experiments 
he had to make before he got a really strong, smooth, useful jar, and 
knew enough to be able to go ahead and make a whole row of 
others like it. 

It was the same with a great many things he tried to do. At first 
he would be awkward and the things would turn out wrong. But he 
was learning patience, and he was building up confidence in himself. 
20 




SOME NEW CLOTHES 



Pretty soon he began to feel that he could do anything that he just had to 
do, and that he would never again have to ask help from anybody else. 

Of course this was a fine way to feel, but unfortunately it wasn't 
quite true, as was proved when he came to build his boat. 

For he did try to make a boat. The idea came to him on the day 
after the earthquake. One night there came up a great storm, and in 
the middle of the night he felt a great shaking of his bed, and his pots 
and pans rattled and fell off the shelves. He sprang out of bed and 
went out to watch the thunder and lightning for a few minutes. This, 
he decided, must be an earthquake. And the next morning, when day- 
light came, he saw that the wrecked ship had broken in halves on the 
sand bar, split by the earthquake. Why shouldn't he go out and get 
some of her big spars and try to make a boat out of them ? 

No sooner said than done, and by afternoon he had started a big, 
long boat, building it in a clear space near his camp. It was such a big 
boat that it took him a long time to build, all by himself. Indeed, 
it was nearly a year before he got it done. And then — what do you 
think ? He discovered that he had built it so far away from the water, 
and it was such a huge, heavy thing, that there was no way for him 
to get it launched ! 

At first he was angry with himself, and then he just sat back and 
laughed ! What a joke on poor Robinson Crusoe ! W 7 hy hadn't he 
taken a few minutes to think, before he began to build? Why hadn't 
he looked ahead to the problem of getting the boat into the water after 
it was made? Here he had gone and built it a quarter of a mile from the 
shore, and he could not possibly pull it down to the water's edge alone! 
Well — that boat would never be any good to him, except as a lesson. 

He was more successful in making himself some new clothes. His 
old ones wore out quickly, and he soon used up the extra clothing 
from the ship, and after a year or so needed more. So he took animal 
skins and dried them in the sun, and somehow or other, with big 
needles and twine, he sewed them into a fine fur costume for himself. 
He even made himself a tall fur cap, for the winters were cold, and he 
needed warm garments. And then, for the hot days of summer, he 
put together a skin umbrella to keep off the sun. 

22 




The next year he started another boat — and you may be sure that 
this time he built it right down at the water's edge. And when it was 
done, after many months, he slid it into the water, and when he had 
rigged up a sail, he was all ready to take nice little trips around the 
island. What fun it was to get out on to the glittering waves once 
more ! Crusoe had by this time almost forgotten what those waves had 
so very nearly done to him all those years ago ! 

He was really enjoying life a great deal now. His health was 
excellent and his muscles were growing strong with all the hard work 
he had to do. For you see, every time he wanted to make a shelf, for

instance, or a table, he had to cut down a big tree in order to get the 
wood. This meant sharpening his axe on the grindstone he had taken 
from the ship, and chopping away for hours, first on one side of the 
trunk and then on the other, till the tree fell in the direction that he 
wanted. Then he had to sharpen several saws and get to work at sawing 
the trunk into long boards. You can imagine how many days of hard 
work this table cost him, and how proud he was of it when it was finished ! 

And so five years went by, and then ten, and still he had no human 
society on his island. In a way, he was thankful, for he realized that 
if there had been natives living on it, they would probably be savages 
who would treat him badly, and perhaps kill him. And then, after a 
few more years had gone by, he had his great adventure. 

He had taken his little boat around to the other side of the island, 
because really that was a better part than the one he had chosen for 
his camp. He was walking along the shore, wondering why he had 
not come over here to live instead — when suddenly, there before him 
in the sand he saw a human footprint ! 

He stopped still, astonished almost out of his wits. Whose was 
this footprint? Not his own, though he had been over there many 
times before, of course. But he saw that a smaller foot than his had 
made the mark. Somebody else was on his island, or had been recently. 
Then, a little farther on he spied something that astonished him 




24 




TO MAKE A TABLE, HE HAD TO CUT 
DOWN A TREE 



still more, and horrified him as well. It was a long heap of bones, 
with some human skulls among them. What could this mean ? 

He sat down and thought it over. It could only mean that at 
some time or other — often, perhaps — savages from some other land 
near by came to visit his island, and while they were there they must 
have killed and eaten some men whom they had captured. Yes, those 
savages must be what were called cannibals — they ate human flesh, 
and liked it. Often he had heard of such people, but this was 
the first time he had ever seen the remains of one of their awful feasts. 
He was thankful, now, that he had not chosen this side of the island 
to live on, for evidently it was here that the cannibals came when they 
came at all, and he was much safer where he was. 




As soon as he got back to his camp he fell to planning some way 
of defending himself against them in case they should pay another call. 
He picked out a spot high on the hill, from which he could see far out 
on the water, and there built himself what is called an ambuscade — 
a shelter from which he could shoot without being seen. In a thicket 
of trees he set up a row of saplings, bound together tightly, with holes 
left between them through which he could put guns. He loaded several 
guns, and braced them into these openings, ready for firing. 

He went up the hill every day, to look through his screen of saplings 
down on to the sand. But presently he got to thinking. Why should 

26 



he shoot savages who didn't know any better ? They had been brought 
up to be cannibals. Who was Robinson Crusoe, he reflected, to be 
their judge? Perhaps he himself would have done the same thing if 
he hadn't been brought up in a Christian country. So he decided that 
as long as they let him alone, he would let them alone. But still he kept 
up his watch, and another year or so went by. 

He felt still safer when he had hit on a way of concealing the fires 
he had to make for warming himself and doing his cooking. For he 
realized that any savages who did come near his island would spy the 
smoke rising from them. But one day, not far from camp, he discovered 
a natural cave in the rocky hillside. Here, he decided, he would build 
his fire after this ; and here, too, he would keep his stores of powder and 
ammunition. 

Robinson Crusoe had great fun all this time with the animals that 
he called "his family." Of course, his dog and his two cats that he 
had brought from the ship had all died of old age long ago; but the 
cats left kittens to grow up after them, and by now he played with 
the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of his original friends. Old 
Polly Parrot was still alive; she was some sort of company. Once he 
waked up in the middle of the night hearing somebody call his name — 




when he investigated, there was nobody around. It was only Polly calling 
"Robinson Crusoe! Robinson Crusoe! " in the darkness of his tent! 

Then, one day, he did see some savages. From his lookout on 
the hill, he spied a fire built on the beach, and around it were a band 
of naked savages, dancing and waving their spears ferociously. Their 
canoes were drawn up on the sand nearby, and they were feasting 
on something that looked terribly like human flesh. For a long time 
Crusoe watched them, and listened to their frightful yelling, without 
knowing what to do. Finally he decided to do nothing. They made 
no move to come around to his side of the island, and after an hour 
or two got into their boats and made off toward the mainland. But 
as he returned to his camp, he felt thankful again that he had all those 
guns ready in his ambuscade. 

Then another year passed without his seeing any other visitors. 
But one day he heard a gun fired, and climbed the hill to see what it 
meant. It sounded to him like the big gun of a ship, and sure enough, 
there was a large vessel a few miles off, jammed on some rocks and fast 
being beaten into a wreck. The men on board had evidently fired 
their gun as a call for any help that might be nearby. Robinson Crusoe 
promptly piled more wood on his fire so that the flames would rise 
high in the air and show the sailors that they would find somebody to 
take care of them if only they could swim ashore. But unhappily none 
of them managed to. By the time Robinson Crusoe got down to the 
sand to help them, the few men who had succeeded in braving the sea 
had failed before they reached the shore, and only their dead bodies 
were washed up at his feet. How sorry he was that none had reached 
him alive! Well, there might still be some living men on the ship 
itself, so he got into his boat and made for the wreck. 

It was a sad visit. When he explored the parts of the ship that he 
could reach, he found that the only men on board were drowned by the 
great waves that had Hooded the vessel. But theirdog was alive, barking 
a furious greeting. So the dog was carried back to the island, along with 
a number of things: clothing from the sailors' chests, and some guns 
and a lot of powder, some kettles and other cooking utensils. 

But for two years more no other human being came within sight 
28 




of his island, and no ship visited it to rescue him. Then, one morning 
when he went outside of his barricade after breakfast, what was his 
astonishment to see five canoes drawn up on the sand not more than 
a half-mile from the camp, but a little around the curve of the shore, 
so that as yet, apparently, their owners had not suspected how near he 
was to them. Evidently they had landed, and were somewhere along 
the beach. Robinson Crusoe was both puzzled and frightened, as you 
may well imagine, for there could not be fewer than twenty or thirty men 

29 




in the company, and how was he to defend himself against so many ? 
However, he climbed to his ambuscade, with his spyglass, and 
looked around until he saw the men. There they were — savages, 
dancing and screaming around their fire, while something cooked on 
the stakes over the flames. His spyglass enabled him to see that it 
was human flesh, and even as he watched, several of the cannibals 
dragged two miserable captives toward the fire. Where they had cap- 
tured these prisoners he could not know, of course, but it was all too 
evident that the terrified men were to be killed and eaten. What was 
he to do ? Was there any way that he could save the victims from 
their awful fate? 

30 



Suddenly one of the savages lifted a heavy club and knocked one 
of the men down. At that moment, while the rest gathered about 
the prostrate figure, the other prisoner sprang away from those who 
were holding him and very swiftly ran along the sand — right in the 
direction of Robinson Crusoe ! 

Now, if he could just keep up that speed, and if not too many of 
his persecutors followed him, he would find safety in the little grove 
of trees where Crusoe was hiding. Sure enough, only three men set out 
after him, and even if they reached the ambush, three men would not be 
hard to deal with, for Robinson Crusoe's guns were all ready for them. 

He did not lose a minute in catching up the gun he carried with 
him and running down toward the creek which lay between him and 
the group that was speeding toward him. By this time, the men were 
hidden from the company around the fire, so when Crusoe reached the 
foremost pursuer, he did not fire his gun, for that would have made a 
sound that the others would hear. Instead, he hit him over the head 
with the stock of his gun, knocked him senseless on the ground, and 
then turned on the other. But this second man was lifting his big bow 
and arrow to his shoulder, preparing to fire. 

And now there wasn't anything to do but use his gun in the 
way it was meant to be used, whether the others were roused or not. 
What he had to do was to put both of these men out of action, and as 
quickly as possible. So he fired, and the second man fell dead. The 
third, at the sound of the shot, turned and fled in terror. At this, 
Crusoe felt safe in looking around for the poor savage who had been 
running away from them. 

Where had he been during these few moments of his rescuer's fight 
with his pursuers? Oh, there he was, over there, sheltering behind a 
tree across the little stream. And frightened to death, by the look of 
him, probably as much from the strange loud noise of the gun as by 
his fear of the men he had escaped ! Robinson Crusoe called to him and 
made signs to show that there was now nothing to threaten his safety. 
The man came forward, and timidly approached his deliverer. Then, 
seeing the kindly look on his deliverer's face, he ran across the sand 
and knelt, trembling, kissing the ground before his new friend's feet. 

31 




THE SECOND MAN FELL DEAD — 




—THE THIRD FLED IN TERROR 



How happy it made Robinson Crusoe to hear the man's voice 
uttering broken words that must be meant for "Thank you' 1 in that 
savage tongue ! For remember, this was the first human voice he had 
listened to in nearly twenty-five years, and it sounded like the sweetest 
music to the castaway ! Here, too, was a companion, a helper, a friend. 
But he had not long to spend on such thoughts, for he realized 
that behind him, stretched on the ground, was the first man, only 
stunned, perhaps preparing to attack again. 

So Crusoe signed to the kneeling Indian to rise, and he handed 
over to him the sword he always carried, and made him understand 
that both of them must deal with the man near them. At once the 
Indian sprang away, and in a few seconds was back again with the head 
of his persecutor, which he had chopped off as the man lay there. Then 
they set to work to bury the two dead bodies, and with that they 
started for the camp. 

Robinson Crusoe looked his new friend over as they walked home- 
ward. He was a straight, handsome young fellow, with long curly 
dark hair, tawny skin, and sparkling black eyes. Of course, neither 
of them could understand a word of the other's language, and for many 
days the only way they could communicate with each other was by 
signs — and funny signs they were, you may be sure. Robinson Crusoe 
had to laugh at their desperate efforts to understand each other. At 
first he kept his new friend in the cave, for fear the rest of the savages 
might discover the camp and try to find the man who had escaped 
from their clutches. But when it became plain that they had all left 
the island, he brought him into his fenced enclosure to live. 

That very first day he hit on a name for his companion — ' ' Friday, ' ' 
because it was on that day of the week that the rescue had occurred. 
And at once there was a great deal for the two men to do, for every- 
thing had to be explained to Friday — somehow — so that he should get 
accustomed as quickly as possible to living the way that his master lived. 
He had never before seen the white men's way of life, and many strange 
things had to be learned. At first, he did not like the idea of putting 
clothes on his body, for he had gone naked all his life; but this feeling 
was soon overcome by his eagerness to do all the things that Robinson 

34 




Crusoe did, and in time he became quite comfortable in his goatskin 
garments. The food, too, was new to him. And of course he had to 
learn how a gun is made to shoot and kill things, though this seemed 
utterly mysterious to him for many months to come. 

His master had some difficulty in teaching him how wrong it was 
to eat human flesh, and how much more delicious were the kinds of 
food that he was now given to eat instead. He learned how to grind 
wheat and bake bread, and do all sorts of helpful things. Of course, 
it was hard at first to make him understand directions. All the English 
names for things were new to him, and his tongue twisted itself almost 
into knots trying to shape the unfamiliar sounds. But he was so merry 

35 




CRUSOE AND FRIDAY— 




— BUILDING THE BIG BOAT 




a fellow that both he and his master got great amusement out of the 
lessons in English. He was naturally bright, and picked up things so 
rapidly that in a few weeks he could talk pretty well himself, and 
could understand practically all he was told. 

From him Robinson Crusoe learned that some time ago, over on 
the mainland where Friday's people lived, seventeen white men had 
come ashore in distress after their ship had been wrecked, and that 
these men were being treated kindly. His master thought that they 
must be Spaniards or Portuguese, and began to think about whether 
38 




there might be some way to reach them. If he could do so, they might 
all together devise some way of traveling back to their homes in Europe. 
There was no friendship between the English and the Spanish. Still, 
he could but try the experiment. But in order to do that, he and Friday 
must build a much larger boat. 

As soon as Friday had learned how to use his master' s tools, they set 
to work to build a boat capable of holding twenty men. Then his 
master showed him how to make a mast and sails, and how to use the 
rudder and the anchor. Then came lessons in sailing the new boat. 

39 



Meanwhile, they were storing up provisions for their voyage, and 
decided to start as soon as the weather was right. 

Then suddenly one day Friday came running towards the camp, 
shouting that there were " one-two-three ' ' boats on the shore. He 
was trembling with fear lest he should be captured and eaten, for he 
had seen that they had three prisoners with them whom they were 
evidently preparing to kill. His master climbed the hill to see, and 
counted twenty-one savages on the sand, with their cowering captives. 

"We must go at once to the rescue, Friday, 1 ' said Crusoe, and 
arming themselves with guns and knives the two went around by the 
wood and the creek until they were within sight of the wretches. Two 
men against twenty-one — this was certainly a daring venture. But 
both men were brave, and both had guns, whereas the savages had none. 
Besides, the attack would be an entire surprise, and probably many of 
the cannibals would take to their heels in fright. 

And so it was. Crusoe and his man Friday approached carefully, 
so as not to be noticed. Then they both hred, and immediately ran 
towards the group, yelling and waving their guns and knives. Several 
ran terrorized to the canoes and tried to get away. Others defended 
themselves as best they could. Crusoe quickly cut the bonds that held 
the prisoners; there were only two now, for the third had been killed 
earlier by the savages, and eaten. When the two were loosed — one a 
Spaniard and the other an Indian — they set about to help in driving 
off their late persecutors. The Spaniard especially, though weakened 
by his experience, seized the knife that Crusoe gave him and promptly 
killed or wounded two of the savages. 

The battle was over in a few moments. The sand was covered 
with dead or wounded, three of the canoes were rapidly disappearing 
into the distance bearing those who had escaped, and Crusoe and 
Friday had a chance to talk to the rescued men. The instant that 
Friday laid eyes on the Indian he gave a wild shout of joy. 

" My father! " he exclaimed. "It is my father! Bad mans took 
him and hurt him — see! Now he safe! " 

And indeed the astonishing fact was true. This old man, en- 
feebled and now wounded, was Friday's father. He had been 

40 



captured, along with the Spaniard, by enemy savages and brought 
here to be eaten — here, on the very island where his son was living. 
At once Friday sped off to bring food and water for his father, while 
Crusoe set about helping the Spaniard toward camp. Later Friday 
carried his father on his back from the shore to the tent, and tended 
him lovingly until he grew strong again. 

Meanwhile the Spaniard, too, was getting better, though he still 
was worried lest his captors should return and attack them all. But 
Crusoe assured him that the violent storm that had swept the sea on 
the evening of the fight had doubtless swamped the canoes and 
drowned all the savages who had run away. He told his companions 
that now was the time to get in touch with the Spaniards who were 
with Friday's people, and plan to return to Europe. 

You see, Robinson Crusoe wanted to make sure that those 
Spaniards would not treat him badly because he was English. The 
one he had saved was entirely friendly and loyal to him, but could he 
persuade the others not to attempt treachery? Well, he decided to 
send the Spaniard and Friday's father over to the mainland in one 
of the canoes that had been left behind, while he and Friday stayed 
on the island and waited for them to return with word of what the 
others said. 

The two set off, with plenty of ammunition and food, and for 
eight days Crusoe and Friday waited. Then, on the ninth day, Friday 
reported a boat off the southern end of the island. His master went 
up the hill with his spyglass, as usual, and, sure enough, there was a 
longboat putting in under sail, and farther out at sea a ship. But 
this was not what they had been looking for — this was plainly an 
English merchant vessel. Oh, how happy Robinson Crusoe felt at 
the hope aroused in him by the sight — as happy as though he were 
a boy again rather than a middle-aged man. After twenty-seven years 
he would hear his own speech once more, see English faces, and at 
last get home ! 

But as he watched, he grew suspicious. The boat drew near his 
shore, not far from the creek, and in it he could see some men bound 
in ropes. Altogether there were eleven, and three seemed to be 

41 




prisoners. He decided to watch a little longer, before joining them. 
The bound men were dragged out of the boat as soon as it landed, 
and one of them in particular was evidently begging mercy of his 
captors. Friday exclaimed, "Oh, master! You see English mans 
going to eat prisoners!" "No, Friday,' 1 answered Crusoe. "Only 
savages do that; but I fear they are going to kill the poor men." 

If only he had now had the Spaniard to help him, he might 
have overpowered the newcomers and rescued their victims ! Still, 
he might yet do so with Friday's aid. The sailors, leaving the three 
on the beach, started off apparently to explore the island. Two of 
their men were left in the boat, but as they seemed to be asleep (drunk, 
really, as Crusoe afterward learned) they paid no attention to the 
outgoing tide, and in a short time the boat was high and dry. When 
42 



they roused themselves, their companions being still gone, they found 
they could not budge the boat; so they, too, set ofl on a ramble. 

This was Crusoe's opportunity to go down and rind out from 
the captives what had happened. So he and Friday approached and 
spoke in friendly tones. "You seem to be in great distress,' 1 he said 
to the man who seemed the eldest. "Can we help? 11 

The man, with tears of relief and gratitude running down his 
face, explained that the others were the crew of his ship, that they had 
mutinied, seized him and the mate and a passenger, and brought them 
here in order to maroon them — that is, to leave them to starve and die. 

"Are any of the crew friendly to you, sir? 11 asked Crusoe. 

"Yes, several of them," the captain answered. "If we could 
but get in touch with them, and all together overcome these others 
— oh, can you help us to do it? 11 

Crusoe then explained briefly who he was and how he happened 
to be on the island, and told the captain how anxious he was to return 
to England. He promised, on conditions, to help him. The captain 
was to yield all authority to Crusoe, to follow his plans, and — if they 
were successful — to take him back to England. Friday was then sent 
to find out where the other men had got to, and came back reporting 
that they were not faraway, talking together, and some of them asleep. 
At his master's direction, he then brought guns and powder from the 
camp, and these were given to the three marooned men to use. 

The five now proceeded to the place where the wicked sailors 
were gathered, and attacked them. A few were killed, others wounded, 
and the rest captured and bound. The attack had surprised them so 
much that they did not defend themselves very well. You see, they 
could not understand where these two strangers had come from — this 
tall, fur-clad figure and his Indian servant. The leader of the mutiny 
was very angry when he found himself bound and helpless, and his 
captain now his conqueror. Some of the others, when Crusoe's plan 
was explained to them, decided to apologize for their rebellion and to 
promise to help him and the captain to get control of the ship again. 
But Crusoe was reluctant to trust them, and ordered them all to be 
tied up safely in the cave. 

43 



That night he and the captain talked over their next movements. 
Somehow they must get out to the ship, where the rest of the crew 
still was, without letting any of those on board dream who they were, 
or what they were planning to do. First, said Crusoe, his man Friday 
must go down and knock a big hole in the bottom of the longboat so 
that it could not be carried off; this was done the next morning. 
Meanwhile, however, the crew on the ship were running up flags as 
signals to the first boat-load of men to return to the ship. Of course 
they got no response. So presently they sent another boat in, with 
ten men, to find out what was the matter. 

As Crusoe stood watching this boat approach and then land where 
the first was lying, he put down his spyglass and turned to the captain. 
"There are ten men there; they look to be desperate villains, sir!" he said. 

"That means that many others are still left on my ship," replied 
the captain, "and of them all there are not more than three or four 
that I would trust. And even with the three or four men in the cave, 
who have promised to help us, I fear that we shall be too few to defeat 
the leaders of the mutiny." 

Crusoe smiled. " If you had lived the life I have, sir, for the past 
twenty-seven years, you would be past any such fears. Any sort of 
chance is worth taking for the sake of getting home again ! Here are 
Friday and I, and you, and the two other prisoners, and finally two 
men, at least, up in the cave, that you think you can count on. We 
seven should certainly be enough for those ten now coming! " 

The newcomers whom they were watching seemed much surprised 
to find the first boat stove in, but they pulled their own alongside, and 
set off to find their friends, calling and hallooing in every direction. 
Presently they returned to the boat and consulted for a moment; then, 
leaving three men in it, the other seven set off again. This worried 
Crusoe. Was he going to let that boat escape, and its men return to 
the ship and perhaps sail away? That would never do. However, 
they rowed the boat out a little way, and there they stayed. The 
others climbed rapidly to the top of a hill, and stood there looking 
around and shouting for their companions, but without seeing Crusoe 
and the others, who were well hidden. 
44 




Then the captain suggested that Crusoe's party should divide and 
wander here and there around the island, shouting as though they were 
the sailors who had come first and were now being looked for, and so 
try to separate the seven on the hill, making them start out wildly in 
all directions towards the shouts. This seemed an excellent plan, and 

45 



they entered into it eagerly. You should have heard Friday yell ! He 
seemed to be everywhere at once, as he ran swiftly and kept turning from 
stream to shore, and from grove to hill, enjoying himself immensely 
in the game of fooling the mutineers. Well, the consequence was that 
the seven men were rushing around and trying to find out where the 
shouts came from, and soon they got separated. 

Crusoe and the captain came together at a spot on the shore just 
as two of the mutineers got there. One they knocked down before 
he knew who they were, and the other they caught and held. It 
appeared, from his protests, that he had been made to join the 
mutiny by force, and he eagerly assured the captain that he would 
help them put it down. And in all the rest of the affair of this exciting 
night, he proved to be one of their best allies. 

For by this time it was getting dark, which didn't trouble Crusoe 
because he knew 7 his way around the place, but was very confusing 
to the mutineers. It seemed to them that they had been wandering 
around for hours without coming on any of the men who were shout- 
ing, and it puzzled them a great deal. They were so sure, of course, 
that it was their companions. Why couldn't they succeed in finding 
each other ? And so presently, in the early evening, they came together 
again, not far from where Crusoe and his party were watching. 

Now, 1 ' said Crusoe, ' ' now is our chance. There are only five of 
them, and eight of us. Let us show ourselves to them, and try to parley 
with them. If they fire on us — but not until then — we will fire back." 

" Look out for Will Atkins especially," the captain warned him. 
"He will probably resist us "fiercely, for he is the one who started 
the mutiny, and wanted to kill me outright, though the others urged 
him just to leave us here to starve. I will point him out to you." 

So, in the darkness, along they crept to where the five were 
standing — softly, secretly, making not a sound as they moved on 
their hands and knees, nearer and nearer. Then up they jumped with 
a wild shout, taking the men completely by surprise. The boatswain 
lifted his gun, but before he could fire it the captain shot him dead, 
and at once called out, "Tom Smith! Tom Smith!" The second 
man, at this, lowered his weapon and cried, "Captain, is it you?" 

46 




CAPTAIN, IS IT YOU?" 




IT WAS MIDNIGHT— 




— AND THE MOON WAS HIGH 



"Ay," the captain answered. 'You had best lay down your 
arms, you and the others, for you see how many we are. You must 
know that this island is an Fnglish possession, and here at my side is 
its Governor." With which Robinson Crusoe stepped forward and 
solemnly bade them all yield in the King's name. For all this was a 
part of his plan, and it was not far from the truth. 

Will Atkins whimpered and begged for mercy, for he was a 
coward as well as a bully. But he and the others were tied up 
promptly and taken back to camp. And now came the time for the 
final step in Crusoe's plan — to have some of his party go out to the 
ship, and make the crew think it was the mutineers returning. 

But he would not go himself, since he and Friday would have 
to stay to guard the prisoners. The captain was to take the mate and 
all the friendly sailors — about a dozen all told — and try to gain 
possession of the ship. First the stove-in boat had to be mended, 
which would give them two boats. By the time this was done, it 
was nearly midnight, and the moon was high. 

As soon as the two boats reached the vessel, the captain ordered 
one of the mutineers to hail her, so that the men on board would 
not suspect anything. The mutineer went on calling to them, 
explaining that they had been delayed on the island longer than they 
had expected, and so allaying all suspicion until the two boat-loads of 
men had climbed up to the deck. Then there was a short, sharp tussle 
as the captain's party fell on the sailors and overpowered them. In 
the fight the new rebel captain was shot down, but this was the only 
man killed. When the rest were all tied up, the real captain ordered the 
ship's guns fired as a signal to Crusoe that they were successful, and at 
once he put off again for the island, with presents for its "Governor." 

You may imagine how relieved and jubilant Robinson Crusoe was 
to hear those guns! They meant deliverance to him— home — England. 
For now he had friends, and a vessel to carry him away from his island 
and back to his family after twenty-nine years. In a few days he had 
put his camp in order and packed everything that he wanted to take 
with him, including Polly Parrot. To the ship were also carried a 
large supply of provisions for the voyage. He and the captain decided 

50 




to be merciful to the worst of the mutineers — not to hang them, as they 
well deserved, but to leave them on the island to take care of themselves 
as best they could. Robinson Crusoe reflected that when he had built 
his camp, years ago, and started all those good things to growing, he 
had not thought they would some day be used by wicked sailors ! 

And so, after a safe voyage, he saw the shores of England again. 
With his faithful servant Friday he made his way quickly to York. 
Alas, both his father and his mother were dead, and all his relatives. 
But he soon married and had a home of his own. The agents in Spain 
who had charge of his estate in Brazil were very glad to hear from him, 
for after all these years they had a great deal of money saved up for 
him, so he was a rich man. The years rolled by, and he and Friday, 
still companions, often talked of the island and their experiences on 
it. Robinson Crusoe would sit by his fire and recall the terrible 
struggles he had gone through in the beginning, but he had to admit 
to himself that, taken all in all, his life there had been happy. And 
certainly his adventure was one of the most thrilling and romantic 
that any man ever had !

THE ARTIST 

E. A. VERPILLEUX 



In 1930, the name Verpilleux 
appeared in many New York papers; 
a Frenchman, whose home was Lon- 
don, had come to New York, and 
pictured our city in colored wood- 
blocks that startled and thrilled 
New Yorkers. His first "show" here 
also included many fine portraits 
of distinguished people here and 
abroad. Mr. Verpilleux brought 
with him some pictures of his favor- 
ite classic, "Robinson Crusoe," 
which will be published in the 
spring of 1931, and plans for a 
"Picture Book of Houses," which 
will be ready in the fall. 

Emile Antoine Verpilleux has 
studied art in England, France, 
Belgium and Holland. He is known 
abroad as a portrait and landscape 
painter, and illustrator for many 
periodicals, and as producer of 
original color prints. During the 
Great War, he served in the Royal 
Flying Corps; he is a captain of the 
Royal Air Force, and won the 
Medal of the British Empire. He 
is fond of yachting and fencing; at 
his country home in Sussex, he is 
a devoted and ingenious gardener. 

At present, he leaves his wife 
and daughters in London, and 
commutes frequently to New York. 
Here he finds himself pursued with 
advertising contracts which aston- 
ish him; but he is keeping most of 
his time for portraits, woodblocks, 
and books. He is without doubt 
one of the most distinguished artists 
added to our list in recent years. 
It was another famous maker of 
Macmillan picture books, Mr. Frank 
Dobias, who brought him to see us, 
with the Robinson Crusoe pictures 
under his arm.
