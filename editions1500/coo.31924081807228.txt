SUGGESTION S T0 TEACHERS.
THE author, in the preparation of this little book, has aimed

to interest and instruct the pupils of Primary Schools and
classes.

which, with the fundamental operations of adding, subtract-
ing, multiplying" and dividing, can be easily and successfully
taught, by the apt teacher, by the proper use of the Numeral
Frame, a box ot'_ beans, or marbles, or similar objects, which
should always be found on the desk of the teacher of young
children.
Only a few suggestions, methods, and applications can be
presented in so small a work as this, as specimen lessons; and it
is expected that the teacher will increase the number and
variety, of the exercises on each page, orally, as the circum-
stances, and the capacity of the child, seem to require.
Examples should be multiplied under each lesson, for the

should be thoroughly committed to memory. In order to insure
this object, the tables should be repeated not only in the direct
order, but promiscuously, and in a reversed order. Thus the
child should be made to understand, that 3 and 5 is the same
as 5 and 3; that 3 times 5 is the same as 5 times 3; that 5
and 5 and 5 is the same as 3 times 5; that if 3 is contained
in 15, 5 times, 5 is contained in 15, 3 times, Etc.
The hints and exercises on pages 10 and 11, as well as those
on pages 24, 25, and 26, should be thoroughly understood and
applied.
The pictures introduced are to interest the pupil, and also
to illustrate some of the processes of Arithmetic, without the
reasoning.

Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1862, by
DA NIEL W. FISH, A.M.

Here is a picture of a frame, with some balls
on the wires, it is called the Numeral Frame.*
How many wires are there '3 How many balls
are one ball and one ball ? Two balls and one ball '2
Three halls and one ball ? Four balls and one
ball? Five balls and one ball ? Six balls and one
ball ? Seven balls and one ball ? Eight balls and
one ball ‘3 Nine balls and one ball ? How many
balls on each wire?


* The apt teacher, by a judicious use of this frame, may
easily teach a. child a great variety of mental exercises; to count
from one to a hundred, and to add, subtract, multiply, and divide,
with facility. The counting and other operations should be
done silently by the eye, and results only, given by the voice.
Adding or counting by ones, twos, threes, he, up to tens, is an
important exercise and easily performed by the use of this frame.

Direct the attention of the pupil to the fact,

are 8; 3 and 25 are 28; 3 and 45 are 48, &c.
If in adding any of the higher numbers he hesi-
tates, he should be referred to the primary sum
of those numbers. Thus, if the pupil hesitates on
68 and 5, he should be asked: “ What do 8 and
5 always give?” (Ans. 3.) Then 68 and 5 must
give the next three above 68, that is 73.
In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results
TABLE—BOOK. 25
instead of saying 5 and 4 are 9, and 3 are 12, and
6 are 18, &c., simply utter the results, 9, 12, 18,&e.
Observe the same practice in subtraction and
multiplication.
Place an example upon the blackboard, as the follow-
267189 ing. Call upon some pupil to commence, who
485736 will begin with the right hand column and say,
918753 “9, 17, 24, 27, 33, 42, write the 2 under the
592847 column added, and carry the 4.- to the next
column." The next pupil will without any
m delay take up the process, beginning with the

SUGGESTION S T0 TEACHERS.
THE author, in the preparation of this little book, has aimed

to interest and instruct the pupils of Primary Schools and
classes.

which, with the fundamental operations of adding, subtract-
ing, multiplying" and dividing, can be easily and successfully
taught, by the apt teacher, by the proper use of the Numeral
Frame, a box ot'_ beans, or marbles, or similar objects, which
should always be found on the desk of the teacher of young
children.
Only a few suggestions, methods, and applications can be
presented in so small a work as this, as specimen lessons; and it
is expected that the teacher will increase the number and
variety, of the exercises on each page, orally, as the circum-
stances, and the capacity of the child, seem to require.
Examples should be multiplied under each lesson, for the

should be thoroughly committed to memory. In order to insure
this object, the tables should be repeated not only in the direct
order, but promiscuously, and in a reversed order. Thus the
child should be made to understand, that 3 and 5 is the same
as 5 and 3; that 3 times 5 is the same as 5 times 3; that 5
and 5 and 5 is the same as 3 times 5; that if 3 is contained
in 15, 5 times, 5 is contained in 15, 3 times, Etc.
The hints and exercises on pages 10 and 11, as well as those
on pages 24, 25, and 26, should be thoroughly understood and
applied.
The pictures introduced are to interest the pupil, and also
to illustrate some of the processes of Arithmetic, without the
reasoning.

* The apt teacher, by a judicious use of this frame, may
easily teach a. child a great variety of mental exercises; to count
from one to a hundred, and to add, subtract, multiply, and divide,
with facility. The counting and other operations should be
done silently by the eye, and results only, given by the voice.
Adding or counting by ones, twos, threes, he, up to tens, is an
important exercise and easily performed by the use of this frame.

LESSON XXI.
The following are all the combinations that can

these thoroughly to memory, which will very
much facilitate the adding of long columns, and
of large amounts with ease and correctness.

Let the above combinations all be learned in the
reversed order; thus, 6 and 8 are 14 ; 8 and 6
are 14, &c. The whole comprising 24 triplets,
and 72 combinations.


ni









Direct the attention of the pupil to the fact,
TABLE—BOOK. 25
TABLE—BOOK. 25
are 8; 3 and 25 are 28; 3 and 45 are 48, &c.
If in adding any of the higher numbers he hesi-
tates, he should be referred to the primary sum
of those numbers. Thus, if the pupil hesitates on
68 and 5, he should be asked: “ What do 8 and
5 always give?” (Ans. 3.) Then 68 and 5 must
give the next three above 68, that is 73.
In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results
TABLE—BOOK. 25
instead of saying 5 and 4 are 9, and 3 are 12, and
6 are 18, &c., simply utter the results, 9, 12, 18,&e.
Observe the same practice in subtraction and
multiplication.
Place an example upon the blackboard, as the follow-
267189 ing. Call upon some pupil to commence, who
485736 will begin with the right hand column and say,
918753 “9, 17, 24, 27, 33, 42, write the 2 under the
592847 column added, and carry the 4.- to the next
column." The next pupil will without any
m delay take up the process, beginning with the
4 to carry, and say, “4, 12, 14, 18, 23, 26, 34,
write the 4 under the column added and carry 3." So
in quick succession let each column be added upwards,
TABLE—BOOK. 25
to right, until the whole class have been exercised upon
it. Very young children may easily be taught, in this

rapidity and correctness.
