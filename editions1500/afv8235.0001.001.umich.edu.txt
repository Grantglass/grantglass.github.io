PREFACE. 

IF ever the Story of any private 
Maris Adventures in the 
World were worth making Fub- 
lick, and ~were acceptable when 
Tubliftid, the Editor of this Ac- 
count thinks this will be fo. 

The Wonders of this Mans 
Life exceed all that (he thinks) is 
to be found extant ; the Life of one 
Man being fcarce capable of a. 
greater Variety. 

The Story is told zvith Mode fly, 
with Serioufnejs , and zvith a reli- 
gious Application of Events to the 
Vfes to which wife Men always 
apply them (viz ) to the InftrucJion

of others by this Example, and to \ 
juftify and honour the Wifdom of I 
Providence in all the Variety of

The Editor believes the thing, '■• 
to be ajuji Hifiory of Fact; nei- ] 
ther is there any appearance of

thinks, became all fuch Things are

LIFE 

kDVENTURES 

J r o f 

lRobi.fi/oa Cru/oe, &c. 

Was born in the Year 1632, in the City 
ofXrfc, of a good Family, tho' not of 
that Country, my Father being a* £0- 
reigner of Bremen, who fettled firfl at 
Jf«0 : He got a good Eftate by Merchan- 
dize, and leaving off his Trade, lived 
i afterwards at Tork 9 from whence he had married my 
1 Mother, whofe Relations were named Robinfln, a very 
Igood Family in that Country, and from whom I was 
I called Robinjon Kreut^naer ; but by the ufual Corrupti- 
I on of Words in England, we are now call'd, nay, we 
call our feWes, and write our Name Crufee, and fo my 
! Companions always call'd me. 

B I 




CO 

I had two elder Brothers, one of which was Liet£ 
tenant Colonel to an Englijh Regiment of Foot in Flan-> 
ders, formerly commanded by the famous Col. LoMart t 
mid was killed at the Battle near Dunkirk againfl the 
Spaniards: What became or my Second Brother 1 ne- 
ver knew, any more than my Father or Mother did 
know what was become of me. 

Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred to 
any Trade, my Head began to be rtll'd very early with 
rambling Thoughts; My Father, who was very anci- 
ent, had given me a competent Share of Learning, as far 
asHoufe-Education, and a Country Free-School generally 
goes,. and defign'd me for the Law ; but I would be 
iatisfy'd with nothing but going to Sea ; and my Incli- 
nation to- this led me fo ftrongly againft the Will, nay 
the Commands of my Father, and againft all the En- 
treaties and Perfwafions of my Mother and dther 
Friends, that there feemed to be lbmething fatal in that 
Propenfion of Nature tending dire&ly to the Life* of 
Miiery which was to befal me. 

My Father* a wife and grave Man, gave me ferious 
And excellent Counfel againft what he ; forfc-faw was my 
Defign. He called me one Morning into his Chamber, 
where he was confined by the Gout, and expoft&lated 
very warmly with me upon this Subje& : He ask'd me 
what Reafons more than a meer wandring Inclination 
I had for leaving my Father's Houfe and my native 
Country, where 1 might be Well introduced, and had 
a Profpe& ofraifing my Fortune by Application and 
Induftry, with a Life of Eafe and Pleafure : He told me 
it was. for Men of defperate Fortunes on one Hand, or of 
afpiring, fuperiourFortunes on the other, and who went 
abroad upon Adventures, to rife by Enter prize, and 
make themfelves famous in Undertakings of a Nature 
jout of the common Road j that thefe things were all ei* 
ther too far above me, or too far below me ; that mine 
was the middle State, or what might be called the up- 
per Station of Zero Zife y which he had found by long 
JEsperience was the belt State in the World ; the moll 
fuited to human Ha,ppiriefs, not expofect to the Miferies 
*nd Hardfhips, the Labour and Sufferings of the me- 
cbanickFart of Mankind^ and not embarate'd with the 

Pride* 



(3) 

Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the upper Part 
of Mankind. He told me, I might judge of the Happi* 
nefs of this State, by this one thing, v/f That this 
was the State of Life which all other People envied ; 
that Rings have frequently lamented the miferable 
Confequences of being born to great Things, and wilh*d 
they had been placed in the middle of the two Extremes, 
between the Mean and the Great ; that the wife Maa 
gave his TefKmony to this as the juft Standard of true 
Felicity, when he prayed to have neither Poverty ot 
Riches. 

He bid me obferve it, and I fbould always find, that 
the Calamities of Life were fhar'd among the upper and 
lower Part of Mankind; but that. the middle Station 
had the feweft Difafters, and was not expos'd to fa 
many Viciffitudes as the higher or lower Part of Man- 
kind ; nay, they were not fubje&ed to fo many Diftem* 
pers and Uneaflneiles either oj Body or Mind, as tbofe 
were, who by vicious Living, Luxury and Extravagan- 
ces on one Hand, or by hard Labour, want of Necef- 
faries, and mean or inefficient Diet on the other Hand* 
bring Diftempers upon themfelves by the natural Confe- 
quences of their Way of Living ; That the middle Sta- 
tion of Life was calculated for all Kind of Virtues, and 
all Kind of Enjoyments 5 that Peace and Plenty were 
the Handmaids of a middle Fortune ; that Temperance, 
Moderation, Quietnefs, Health, Society, all agreeable 
Diverfions, and all deferable Pleafures, were the Blef*' 
iings attending the middle Station of life • that this way- 
Men went filently and fmoothly thro' the World, and \ 
comfortably outrtjf it ; notembarafs'd with the Labours 
of the Hands or of the Head, not fold to a Life" of Sla- 
very for daily Bread, or harrafs'd with perplexed Cir- 
eumftances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body of 
Reft ; nor enraged with the Paffion of Envy, or thefecret 
burning Lull: of Ambition for great things; but in ea- 
fy Circumftances Aiding gently thro* the World, and 
fenflbly tailing the Sweets of Living, without the Bitter, 
feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day*s 
Experience to know it more fenfibly. 

After this, he prefs'd me earneftly, and in the mod 
affeftionate manner, not to play the young Man, nortpw

precipitate my felf into Miieries which Nature and the 
Station of Lite i was born in, feem'd to have provided 
againit, $ that I was under no NeceiTity of feeking my 
Bread ; that he would do well for me, and endeavour 
to enter me fairly into the Station of Life which he had 
been juft: recommending to me; and thatif I was not ve- 
ry eaiy and happy in the World, it muft be my meer 
Irate, or Fault that muft hinder it, and that he fhould 
have nothing to aniwer for, having thus diicharged his 
Duty in warning me againft Mealures which he knew 
would be to my hurt : In a word, that as he would do 
very kind things for me if I would flay and fettle at 
Home, as he dire&ed •, fo he would not have fo much 
hand in my ivi isfortunes, as to give me any Encourage- 
ment to go away: And to cloi'e all, he told me, I had 
my elder Brother for an Example, to whom he had ufed 
the fame earned Perfwafions to keep him (rem going 
into the Low Country Wars, but could not prevail, 
his voung Defires prompting him to run into the Army, 
where he was killed ; and tho' he (aid he would not ceafe 
to pray for me, yet he would venture to fay to me,that if 
1 did take this foolifh Step, God would not blefs me, 
and I would have Leifure hereafter to refit & upon hav- 
ing negle£ed his Counfel, when there might be none 
to aflift in my Recovery. 

.' I obferved in this lafl part of his Difcourfe, which 
was truly Prophetick, tho* I iuppofe my Father did not 
know it to be {o himfeli ; I fay, I obfervM the Tears 
run down his Face very plentifully, efpecially when 
he fppke of my Brother who was killed ; and that when 
he (poke of my having Leifure to repent, and none to 
aMftrne, he was lo mov'd, that he broke off the Di£ 
courfe, and told me, his Heart was fo full, he could fay 
no more to me. 

I was iincerely affeAed with this Difcourfe, as in- 
deed who could be other wife? and I refolv'd not to 
think of going Abroad any more, but to fettle at Home 
according to my Father's Delire : But alas ! a few Days 
wore it all off $ and in fhort, to prevent any of my Fa*. 
ther's farther Importunities, in a few Weeks afterlrefolv-* 
ed to run quite away from him. However, I did not a£fc 
fo haftily neither as the firft heat ofmyRefolution promp- '*■

§&, but I took my Mother at a time when T thought 
her a little pleaianter than ordinary, and told her, that 
my Thoughts were ib entirely bent upon feeing the 
World, that i ihouid never fettle to any thing with Re- 
iblution enough to go through with it, and my Father 
had better give me his Content, than force me to go 
without it ; that 1 was now eighteen Years old, which 
was too late to go Apprentice to a Trade, or Clerk to 
an Attorney ; that 1 was lure, if I did, 1 fhould never 
ferve out my Time, but I ihouid certainly run away 
from my Mailer before my Time was out, and go to 
Sea ; and if fhe would fpeak to my Father to let me go 
one Voyage abroad, if 1 came home again and did not 
like it, I would go no more, and I would promife by a 
double Diligence to recover the Time that I had loll. 

This put my Mother into a great Paifion : She told 
me, Ihe knew it would be to no purpofe to fpeak to my 
Father upon any fiich Subject ; that he knew too well 
what was my lnterefl, to give his Confent to any 
thing fo much for my Hurt, and that ihe wondered how 
I could think of any fuch thing, after the Difcourlb 
1 had had with my Father, and fuch kind and ten- 
der Expreifions as ihe knew my Father had uled to me ; 
and that in inort, iff w r ould ruin my felf, there was no 
help for me ; but I might depend I fhould never have 
their Confent to it : That for her part fhe would not 
have fo much hand in my Deftru&ion ; and I fhould 
never have it to fay, that my Mother was willing when 
my Father was not. 

Tho' my Mother refufed to move it to my Father* 
yet, as I heard afterwards, that fhe reported ail the 
Difcourie to him ; and that my Father, after fhewyi^a 
great Concern at it, laid toiler with a Sigh, That Boy 
might be happy if he would flay at Home, but if he 
goes Abroad, he will be the mofl miferabled Wretch 
that ever was born ; I can give no Confent to it. 

It was not till almoft a Year after this that I broke 
loofe, tbo J in the mean time I continued obflinately 
de%f to ail Propofals of fettling to Bufmefs, and frequent- 
ly expollulating with my Father and Mother, about 
their being fo poiitively determin'd againfl what they 
knew my Inclinations prompted me t«j. But being one 
B 3 Day' 



Day at Hull, where I went cafually, and without any 
purpofe of making an Elopement that time $ but I fay, 
being there, and one of my Companions being going 
hySeato Linden in his Father's Ship, and prompting 
me to go with them, with the common Allurement of 
Seafaring Men, viz* That it fhould coil me nothing for 
thy Paflage, I confulted neither Father or Mother any 
aiore, nor lb much as lent them word of it; but leav- 
ing them to hear of it as they might, without asking 
God's Bleffing, or my Fathers, without any Confide- 
Vation of Circumftances or Corifequences, and in an ill 
Hour, God knows, on the frrft of September 1651, I 
went on Board a Ship bound for London : Never any 
young Adventurer's Misfortunes, I believe, began foon- 
«©r, or continued longer than mine : The Ship was no 
iboner gotten out of the Humber r but the Wind began to 
blow, and the Sea to rife in a moil frightful manner ; 
3nd as I had never been at Sea before, i was mofl inex- 
jpreffibly fick in Body, and terrify'd in Mind : I began 
now ierioufly to refle& upon what I had done, and how 
jiiiliy i was overtaken by thejudgtnent of Heaven for my 
wicked leaving my Father's Houfe, and abandoning my 
Duty j all the good Counfel of my Parents, my Father's 
Tears, and my Mother's Entreaties came now frefh into 
my Mind, and rny Confcience, which was not yet come 
to the Pitch of Hardriefs to which it has been fince, re- 
proach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the 
Breach of my Duty to God and my Father. 

All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea, which 
I had never been upon before, went very high, though 
nothing like what I have feen many times fince ; no, 
iM like what I faw a few Dajs after : But it was enough 
to ahfeclt me then, who was but a young Sailor, and had 
never known any thing pf the matter. I expected every 
Wave would have fwallowed us up, and that every time 
the Ship fell d®Wn as I thought it did, in the Trough or 
Hollow of the Sea, we fhould never rife more: In this 
Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Refolutions, 
that if it would pleafe God to fpare my Life in this 
one Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land 
again, 1 would go diredly home to my Father, and ne- 
*er ft tit into a Ship again while I lived ; that I would ' 

take 



( 7 ) 

take bis Advice, and never run my felf into fucli Mife* 
ries as thefe any more. Now I faw plainly the Good- 
nefs of his Qbfervations about the middle Station of Life, 
how eafy, bow comfortable he had lived all his Days, and 
never had been expofed to Tempefls at Sea, or Troubles 
on Shore; andin fhort I refolv'd that I would, like a true 
penting Prodigal, go home to my Father. 

» Thefe wile and fober Thoughts continued all the 
while the Storm continued, and indeed ibme time after ; 
but the next Day the Wind was abated and the Sea cal- 
mer, and! began to be a little inur'dto it : However, 
I was very grave for all that Day, being alio a little Sea- 
fick ftill -y but towards Night the Weather clear'd up, 
the Wind was quite over, and a charming fine Evening 
fbllow'd ; the Sun went down perfectly clear, and rofe 
fo the next Morning, and having little or no Wind, and 
a fmooth Sea, the Sun lhining upon it, the Sight was, 
as I thought, the moft delightful that ever I faw. 

I had flept well in the Night, and was now no more 
Sea-fick, but very chearful; looking with wonder upon 
the Sea 'that was fo rough and terrible the Day before^ 
and could be fo calm and fo pleafant in fo little time af- 
ter. And now left my good Refolutions fhould conti- 
nue, my Companion, who had indeed enticed me away, 
comes to me, Well Bob, fays he, clapping rr.e upon the 
Shoulder, H w do you do after it ? 1 warranty you veer 9

Bob : come let us make a Bcwl of Punchy and we'll f rget 
all that ; d'ye fee what charming Weather 'tis now? To 
moke ihort this fad Part of my Story, we went the way 
oFall Sailors, the Punch was made, and I was made half 
drunk with it, and in that one Night's Wickednefs I 
drown'd all my Repentance, all my Reflections upon my 
pad Conduct, all my Refolutions for the future. In a 
word, as the Sea was return'd to its fmpothnefs of Sur- 
face and fettled Calmnefs by the abatement of that 
$torm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over my 
B 4 Fears 



( 8) 

Fears and Apprehenfions oi being fvvallow'd up by Sea 
being forgotten, and the Current of my former Deiires 
returned, I entirely fbvgot the Vows and iromiies that 
1 made in my Diilreis. 1 found indeed ibme Intervals 
of Reflexion, and the ferious Thoughts did, as it were, 
endeavour to return again fome times ; but I fhook them 
off, and rouz'd my Ielf from them as it were from a 
Diltemper, and applying my ielf to Drinking and Com- 
pany, foon mafter'd the Return of thole Fits, (tor To 
I eall'd them) and I had in five or iix Days got as eom- 
pleat a Vi&ory over Continence, as any young Fellow 
that refolv'd not to be troubled with it, could deiire : 
But I was to have another Trial for it dill ; and Pro- 
vidence, as in fuch Caies generally it dees, reiblv'd to 
leave me entirely without excufe; For if I would not 
take this for a Deliverance, the next was to be fuch a 
one, as the word and muft hardened V\ retch among us 
"would contefs both the Danger and the Mercy. 

The fixth Day of our being at Sea, we came into 
Yarmouth Roads \ the Wind having been contrary, and 
the Weather calm, we had made but little Way fince 
the Storm. Here we were oblig'd to come to an Anchor, 
and here we lay, the Wind continuing contrary, vi$, 
at South-Weft, for feven or eight Days, during which 
time a great many Ships from Newcaftle came into the 
lame Roads, as the common Harbour where the Ships 
might wait for a W 7 ind for the River. 

We had not however rid here fo long, but we fhould 
have Tided it up the River, but that the Wind blew too 
freih ; and after we had lain four or five Days, blew 
very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as 
goocl as a Harbour, the A nehorage good, and our Ground- 
• Tackle very ftrong, our Men were unconcerned, and 
not in the leaft apprehenfive of Danger, but fpent the 
Time in Reft and Mirth, after the manner of the Sea ; 
but the eighth Day in the Morning, the Wind increafed, 
and we bad all Hands at work to ftrike our Top-Mails, 
and make every thing fnug and dole, that the Ship 
might ride as eafy as poffible. By Noon the Sea went 
very high indeed, and our Ship rid For ecaflie m^ Hup- 
ped feveral Seas, and we thought once or twice our An- 
chor had come Home \ upon which our Mailer order'd 

'■■■■"'" v "" " out 



(p) 



out the Sheet- Anchor; fo that we rode with two An- 
chors a-head, and the Cables vered out to the better End* 

By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed, and 
now I began to fee Terror and Amazement in the Faces 
even of the Seamen themlelves. The Mailer, tho' vi- 
gilant in the Bufinefs or' preferving the Ship, yet as he 
went in and out of his Cabin by me, I could hear him 
fbftly to himielf lay ieveral times, Lord be merciful to us,, 
wejhall be ail loft, rve jhall be all undone ; and the like: 
During thefe firit Hurries, I was ftupid, lying fliil in my 
Cabin, which was in the Steerage, and cannot defcribe 
my Temper : I could ill refume the firit Penitence which, 
I had io apparently trampled upon, and. harden'd my 
felf againfl : I thought the Bitternels of Death had been 
pad, and that this would be nothing too, like the firfl. 
But when the Mailer himfelf came by me, as I laid juft 
now, and faid we fhould be all loft, I was dreadfully 
frighted: I got up out of my Cabin, and look'd out* 
but fueh a difmai Sight I never faw; The Sea went 
Mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four 
Minutes: When I could look about, I could fee no- 
thing but Diftrefs round us: Two Ships that rid near- 
us, we found, had cut their Mails by the Board, being, 
deep loaden ; and our Men cry'd out, that a Ship which 
rid about a Mile a-head of us, was founder'd. Twq 
more Ships being driven from their Anchors, were rurt 
out of the Roads to Sea, at all Adventures, and that not 
with a Mail {landing. The light Ships fared the beft^ 
as not fo much labouring in the Sea •, but two or three; 
of them drove, and came clofe by us, running away with. 
only their Sprk-jail out, before the Wind. 

Towards Evening the Mate and Boatfwaih begg'd 
the Mailer of our Ship to let them cut a*? ay the Pore- 
Maft, which he was very unwilling^to : But the Boat* 
fwain proteiting to him, that if he did not, the Shir> 
would founder, he confented ; and when they bad cut 
away the Fore-mail, the Main-maft flood fo loofe, and 
ihook the Ship* fo much, they were obliged to cut her 
away alfo, and make a clear Deck. 

Any one may judge what a Condition I mart be im 
at all this, who was but a young Sailor v and who had 
b^en in fuch a Fright before at but a little. But if T 

B. 5 ' ca& 



( to ) 

can exprefs at this diftance tlie Thoughts I had about 
me at that time, I was in tenfold more Horror of Mind 
upon account of my former Convi&ions, and the hav- 
ing returned from them to the Refolutions I had wic- 
kedly taken at firft, than I was at Death itfelf 5 and 
thefe, added to the Terror of the Storm, put me in fuch 
a Condition, that I can by no Words defcribe it. But 
the worft was not come yet ; the Storm continued with 
fuch Fury, that the Seamen themfelves acknowledged 
they had never known a worfe. We had a good Ship, 
But fhe was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, that 
the Seamen every now and then cried out, fhe would 
founder. It was my Advantage in one refpe&, that I 
<iid not know what they meant by founder, till I en- 
<juir'd. However, the Storm was fo violent, that I faw 
what is not often feen, the Mafter, the Boatfwain, and 
fome others more fenfible than the reft, at their Pray- 
ers, and -expe&ing every moment when the Ship would 
3*0 to the Bottom. In the middle of the Night, and 
under all the reft of our Diftreffes, one of the Men that 
had been down on purpoie to fee, cried out we had 
fprung a Leak; another faid, there was four Foot Wa- 
ter in the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the 
Pump. At that very Word my Heart, as I thought, 
"-died within me, and I fell backwards upon the fide of 
iny Bed where I fat, into the Cabin. However, the 
Men rouz'd me, and told me, that I that was able to 
ido nothing before, was as well able to pump as another J 
at which i ftirr'd up, and went to the Pump, and 
*vork'd very heartily. While this was doing, the Ma« 
-fter teeing fome light Colliers, who, notable to ride out 
*h? Storm, were oblig'd to flip and run away to Sea, 
and would come near us, order'd to fire a Gun as a Sig- 
nal of Diftrefs. 1 who knew nothing what that meant, 
•Was {o furprized, that I thought the Ship had broke, or 
fome dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was fo 
furprized, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a 
time when every body had his own Life to think of, no 
body minded me, or what was become of me ; but an- 
other Man ftept up to the Pump, and thrufting me afide 
with his Foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead j 
and it was a great while before I came to my felf.

We worWi on j but the Water enereafing in itbe Holdi 
it was apparent that the Ship would founder ; and tho* 
the Storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not pof- 
fible fiie could fwimtill we might run into any Port, 16 
the Matter continued firing Guns for Help ; and a light 
Ship who had rid it out juft a-head of us, ventured a 
Boat out to help us. It was with the utmoft Hazard 
the Boat came near us, but it was impoffible for us ta 
get on Board, or for the Boat to lie near the Ship fide* 
till at laft the Men rowing very heartily, and ventur- 
ing their Lives to fave ours, our Men caft them a Rope 
over the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it ouc 
k great Length, which they after great Labour and Ha- 
zard took hold of, and we haul'd them clofe under our 
Stern, and got ail into their Boat. It was to no pur- 
pofe for them or us, after we were in the Boat, to think 
of reaching to their own Ship ; fo all agreed to let her 
drive, and only to pull her in towards Shore as much 
as we could, and our Mafter promifed them, That if the 
Boat Was ftav'd upon Shore, he would make it good 
to their Mafter: So partly rowing and partly driving" 
our Boat went away to the Northward, Hoping to* 
wards the Shore, almoft as far as Winter tm*Nejs. 

We were not much more than a Quarter of an Hour 
out of our Ship, but we faw her fink: And then I un- 
derilood for the firft time, what was meant by a Ship 
foundering in the Sea. 1 muft acknowledge I had hard* 
ly Eyes to look up, when the Sea-men told me fhe was 
finking; for from that Moment they rather put me 
into the Boat, than that I might be faid to go in, my 
Heart was as it were dead within me, partly with 
Fright, partly with Horror of Mind, and the Thoughts 
Of what was yet before me. 

' While we were in this Condition, the Men yet la- 
louring at the Oar to bring the Boat near the Shore, 
we could fee, (when our Boat m6iinttn| the Waves, 
Vre were able to. fee the Shore) a great many People 
running along the Strand to afTift-us wlieii we fhould 
fcome near : But we made but flow Way towards the

hroke off a little the Violence of the Wind; Here we 
got in, and tho' not without much Difficulty, got all 
Jafe on Shore, and walk'd alter wards on Foot to Tar* 
■mouth, where, as unfortunate Men, we were ufed with 
great Humanity, as well by the Magiftrates of the 
Town, who ailign'd us good Quarters, as by particu- 
lar Merchants- and Owners of Ships; and had Money 
given us f ufficient to carry us either to London, or back 
to Hull y as we thought iit. 

Had I now had the Senfe to have gone back to 
Hui! s and have gone Home, I had been happy, and my 
Father, an Emblem of our blefFed Saviour's Parable, 
had even kill'd the fatted Calf for me; for hearing the 
Ship I went away in, was call away in Yarmouth Road, 
it was a great while, before he had any AfTurance that 
I was not drown'd. 

. But my ill Fate pufh'd me on now, with an Obfti- 
nacy that nothing could refift ; And tho' I had feveral 
times loud Calls from my Keafon, and my more com- 
pofed Judgment to go home, )et I had no Power to 
do it: I know not what to call this, nor will I urge, 
that it is ajecret over- ruling Decree, that hurries us on 
to be the Inflruments of our own Deftru&ion, even 
tho' it be before us, and that we pufli upon it with our 
Eyes open. Certainly, nothing but fome fuch decreed 
unavoidable Mifery attending, and which it was im- 
poilible for me to efcape, c^uld have pufli'd me forward 
againil the calm Reafonings and Perfwafions of my moil 
retired Thoughts, and againft two fuch viiible Inftruc- 
tions as I had met with in my firft Attempt. 
, My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me be- 
fore, and who was the Matter's Son, was now lefs for- 
ward than I. The firft time he fpoke to me after we 
were at Tar mouthy which was not till two or three 
Days; for we were feparated in the Town to feveral 
Quarters : I fay, the fJrfl time he law me, it appear'd 
Iris Tone was alter'd ; and looking very melancholy, and 
fhaking his Head, ask'd me how I did; And telling his 
father who I was, and bow I had come this Voyage 
only for a Tryal, in order to go farther abroad ; his 
Father turning to me with a very grave and concerned 
Tope ; Tcung Man, lays hc^jou ought mver to go to Sea 



C*3) 

ony more yyou ought to take this fir a plain and vi ft Me 
'token, that you are not to he a Seafaring Man. Why r 
Sir, laid I, will you goto Sea no more P That is ano- 
ther Cafe, laid he, it it my Calling , and therefore my Da* 
ty\ but m you made th'ps Voyage j ''or a Try 'at , y.u fee vofoat\ 
a Tafle Heaven bw given you, of what you are to expect if 
you perfi/i j perhaps thU is all befallen us on your Account, 
like Jonah in the Ship of Tarihiili. Pray, continues he, 
what are you ? And on what Account did you go to Sea ? 
upon that I told him ibme of my Story ; at the End of 
which he burit out with a Change kind of Pailion ; What 
had I done ! lays he, that fueh an unhappy W retch 
ihould come into my Ship ! I would not let my Foot in 
the fame Ship with thee again for a 1 houfand Pounds .* 
This indeed was, as L faid, an Excuriion of his Spirits, 
which were yet agitated by the Senie of his Lofs, and 
was farther than he could have Authority to go : How- 
ever, he afterwards talk'd very gravely to me, exhor- 
me to go back to my Father, and not tempt Providence 
to my &uin ; told me I might lee a vifible Hand of 
Heaven againft me ; And young Alan, laid he, depend 
upon it> ij you do not go back, where ever you go, you will 
meet with nothing but Difajlers and Difappointments^ till 
your Father's Words are fulfilled uponfou, 

We parted loon after ; for I made him little Anfwer, 
and I law him uo mure; which way he went I know not : 
As for me, having iome Money in my Pocket,! travelled 
to London by Land ; and there, as well as on the Road, had 
many Struggles with my felf, what Courfe of Life I 
ihould take^and whether I ihould go Home, or go to Sea. 

As to going Home, Shame oppoied the beft Motions 
that offered to my Thoughts \ and it. immediately, qc- 
curr'd to me how I ihould be laugh' d at among the 
Neighbours, and ihould be aiham'd to fee, not my Father 
and Mother only, but even every Body elfe : From 
whence I have iince often obferv'd how incongruous and 
irrational the common Temper of Mankind is, efpeci- 
ally f of Youth, to that Reafon which ought to guide 
them in iuch Cafes, vi^. That they are not aiham'd to 
iin, and yet are aiham'd to repent \ not aiham'd of the 
Adion for which they ought juftiy to beefteem'd Fools, 
but are afhamed of the returning, wbkkotlly can make| 
them eiteem'd wife Men. In 



( 14) 



fn this State of Life however 1 remain'd fome tiriie? 
uncertain what Meafu res to take, and what Courfe of 
Life to lead. An irrefiflible Relu&ance continued to 
going Home ; and as I fiay'd a while, the Remembrance 
of the Diftrefs I had been in wore off ; and as that a-* 
bated, the little Motion I had in my Deflres to a Re- 
turn, wore off with it, till at laft I quite laid afide the 
Thoughts of it, and looked out for a Voyage. 

That evil Influence which carried me firft away 
from my Father's Houfe,which hurried me into the wild 
and indigefted Notion of raifing my Fortune ; and that 
imprefs'dthofe Conceits fo forcibly upon me, as to make 
me deaf to all good Advice, and to the Entreaties, and 
even the Commands of my Father ; I iky, the fame 
Influence, whatever it was, prefented the mod unfor- 
tunate of all Enterprizes to my View; and I went on 
board a VefTel bound to the Coaft of Africa, or, as our 
Sailors valgarly call it, a Voyage to Guinzy. 

It was my great Misfortune, that in all thefe Ad- 
ventures 1 did not fhip my kK as a Sailor ; whereby, 
tho* I might indeed have work'd a little harder than 
ordinary, yet at the lame time I had learn'd the Duty 
and Office of a Foremafl Man ; and in time might 
have qualified my felf for a Mate or Lieutenant, if not 
for a Mafter. But as it was always my Fate to chufe 
fortheworfe, fo I did here; for having Money in my 
Pocket, and good Cloaths upon my Back, I would al- 
ways go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman ; and fo t 
neither had anyBufinefsin the Shi^or learn'd* to do any. 
• It was my Lot firft of all to fall into pretty good 
Company in Loridon, which does not always happen to 
fiich loofe and unguided young Fellows as I then was ; 
the Devil generally cot omitting to lay fome Snare for 
them very early : But it was not fo with me ; I firft fell 
Acquainted with the Mafter of a Ship who had been on 
the Coaft of Gifitiey) and who having had very good 
Succete ther& was refolved to go again ; this Capt. tak • 
king a Fancy to my Converfattoh,? -which „was hot 
difagreeabte at that time, hearing me fey I had a 
Mnd to fee the "World, told me, if I would go the 
Voyage with him, I Should be it no Expence; I ihould 
Tbeim Mefs-Mate and his Companion j and if I could 



(15) 

ferry any thing with me, 1 fhould have all the Ad van- 
Age of it that the Trade would admit \ and perhaps t 
j&ii^ht meet with fome Encouragement. 

* 1 embraced the Offer, and entring into a ftri& Friend- 
jhip with this Captain, who was an honeft: and plain- 
pealing Man, I went the Voyage with him, and car- 
tied a fmall Adventure with me, which by the difinte- 
f efted Honefty of my Friend the Captain, I encreafed 
Very confiderably •, fori carried about 40/. in fuch 
5foys and Trifles as the Captain dire&ed me to buy# 
!This 40 /. I had mufter'd together by the Affiftarice of 
ibme of my Relations whom 1 correfponded with, and 
"who, I believe, got my Father, or at lead my Mother, 
to contribute fo much as that, to my firft Adventure. 

This was the only Voyage which I may fay was fuc- 
cefsful in all my Adventures, and which I owe to the 
Integrity and Honefty of my Friend the Captain ; un- 
der whom alfo I got a competent Knowledge of the 
i Mathematicks and the Rules of Navigation, learn'd how 
jto keep an account of the Ship's Courfe, take an Obfer- 
:vation, and, in ihort, to underftand iome things that 
; were needful to be underftood by a Sailor : For as he 
I took delight to introduce me, I took delight to learn ; 
! and, in a Word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor 
land a Merchant : Fori brought home $ Pound 9 Oun- 
|ces of Gold-Duftfor my Adventure, which yielded me 
|in London At my Return, almoft 300 1, and this filled 
I me with thofe afpiring Thoughts which have fince fa 
i com pleated my Ruin. 
! Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes too $ 

* particularly that I was continually iick, being thrown 
>into a violent Calenture by the exceflive Heat ©fthe 

* Climate ; our principal Trading being upon the Coaft, 
v; from the Lat. of 15 Degrees N. even to the Line it felf. 
I I was now fet up for a Guinty Trader ; and my Friend, 
I to my great Mbfor tune, dying foon after his Arrival, £ 
,j refolved to go the fame Voyage again, and I embark'd 
I in the lame Vefl'el with one who was his Mate in the 
1 former Voyage, and had now got the Command of the 
1 Ship. This was the unhappieft Voyage that ever Man 

I made ; for tho' I did not carry quitd 100 /. of my new 
gaih'dWealthjfg that I bad 200/.left,and which I lodg'd 

with 



( iO 



with- my Friend's Widow, who was very juft to me, 
yet I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage ; and 
the firil was this, vi\. Our Ship making her Courie to. 
wards the Canary Iflands, or rather between thole tilands 
and the African Shore, wasfurpriz'd in the Gray of the 
Morning by a Mocrijh Rover of Saliee, who gave cbace 
to us with all the Sail fhe could make. We crowded 
alio as much Canvafs as our Yards would fpread, or our 
Mails carry, to have got clear j but finding the Pirate 
gain'd upon us, and would certainly come up with us in 
a tew Hours, we prepared to fight ; our Ship having 
12 Guns, and the Rogue 18. About three in the Af- 
ternoon he came up with us, and bringing to, by miitake, 
juil athwart our Quarter, inliead of atftwart our Stem, 
as he intended, we brought 8 or our Guns to bear on that 
fide, and pour'd in a Broadiide upon him, which made 
him fheer off again, after returning our Fire, and pouring 
|n alio his imaii Shot from near 200 Men which he had 
on Board, However, we had not a Man touch'd, all 
pur Men keeping clofe : He prepaid to attack us again, 
and we to defend our felves •, but laying us on Board the 
pext time upon our other Quarter, he entered 90 Men 
upon our Decks, who immediately tell to cutting and 
packing the Decks and Rigging. We ply'd them with 
Small-ihot, Half- Pikes, Powder -Cheits, and fuch like, 
and cleared our Deck of them twice. However, to cut 
fhort this melancholy part of our Story, our Ship be- 
ing difabled, and three of our Men kill'd, and eight 
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carry'd 
all Priibners into Sallee, a Port belonging to the Moors. 
The Ufage I had there was not fo dreadful as at firft 
I apprehended ; nor was I carried up the Country to 
the Emperor's Court, as the reft of our Men were, but 
was kept by the Captain of the Rover, as his proper 
Prize, and made his Slave, being young and nimble, and 
fit for his Bufinefs. At this furprizing Change of my 
Circumftances, from a Merchant to a Miierable Slave, 
I was perfectly overwhelmed ; and now I look'd back 
upon my Father's prophetick Difcourfe to me, that [ 
fhould be miferable, and have none to relieve me, which 
I thought was now fo efFe&ually brought to pais, that [ 
could not be worfe j that now the Hand of Heaven had 

over* 



( -i.7 ") 

overtaken me, and I was undone without Redemption* 
But alas ! this was but a Tafte or the . Mifery I was 
to go thro 5 , as will appear in the Sequal of this Story. 

As my new Patron, or Mailer, had taken me home 
to this Houfe, fo I was in Hopes that he would take me 
with him when he went to Sea again, believing that it 
would fome time or other be his Fate to be taken by a 
Spanijh or Portugal M an of War ; and that then I fhould 
be let at Liberty. But this Hope of mine was foon ta.» 
keq away $ for when he went to Sea, he left me on Shore 
to look after his little Garden, and do the common 
Drudgery of Slaves about his Houfe; and when he came 
home again from his Cruiie, he ordered me to lie in the 
Cabin, to look after the Ship. 

Here I mediated nothing but my Efcape, and what 
Method I might take to efFedt it ; but found no way that 
hadtheleaft Probability in it: Nothing prefented to 
make the Suppofition of it rational ; for I had no Body 
to communicate it to, that would embark with me, no 
Fellow Slave, no Mnglijhman> IrijhnMn^ or Scctfman 
there but my felf ; io that for two Years, tho* I often 
plea fed my felf with the Imagination, yet I never had 
theleaft encouraging rproFpecfc of putting it in Practice, 
' After about two Years, an odd Circumilance preient- 
ed it felf, which put the old Thoughts of making fome 
attempt for my Liberty again in my Head : My Patron 
lying at home longer than ufual, without fitting out 
his Ship, which, as I heard was for want of Money, 
he ufed confta'ntly once or twice a Week, fometimes oft- 
ner, if the Weather was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, 
and go out into the Road a filhing ; and as he always 
took me and a young Marefco with him to row the Boat^ 
we made him very merry, and I prov'd verydexterousm 
catchingFilhj inibmch, that fometimes he would fend me 
with a Moor, one of his iUnfmen, and the Youth the Mar 
refco, as they called him, to catch a Diih o^ Fiih for him. 

It happened one time, that going afilhing with him in 
calm Morning, a Fog role to thick, that tho' we were 
not half a League from the Shore, we loft fight o^ it ; 
and rowing we knew hot whither or which way, we. 
labour'd all Day, and all the next Night ; and when the. 
Morning came 3 we found we had pulFd off to Sea, in- 

ftead 



PK£ 



(18) 

(lead of pulling in for the Shore; and that we were at 
feaft two Leagues from the Land : However, we got 
well in again, tho* with a great deal of Labour, and 
fome Danger ; for the Wind began to blow pretty frefh in 
the Motning ; but particularly we were all very hungry. 

But our Fatron warn'd by thisl>ifa{ler, refolved to 
take moreCare of himfelfforthe future; and having lying 
by him the Long-Boat of our lEnglijb Ship which he had 
taken, he refolved he would not go a fifliing anymore 
without a Compafs and ibrhe Provifion \ fo he order'd 
the Carpenter of his Ship, who alfo was an Englijh 
Slave, to build a little State*room or Cabin in the mid* 
die of the Long-Boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place 
to ftand behind it to fleer, and haul home the Main-fheet J 
and room before for a hand or two to ftarid and work 
the Sails. She faiPd with that we call a Shoulder of 
Mutton Sail ; and the Boom gibM over the Top of the 
Cabin, which lay very frrtig and low, and had in it s 
room for him to lie, with a Slave or two, and a Table 
to eat on, with {ome fmall Lockers to put in fome Bot* 
ties of fuch Liquor as he thought fit to drink j particu* 
larly his Bread, Rice and Coffee. 

We were frequently out with this Boat a fifhingj and 
and as 1 was moft dextrous to catch Fiih for him, he 
never went Without me. It happened one ; day, that he 
had appointed to go out in this Boat, either for Plea- 
sure or for Fifh, with two or three Moors of fome 
Diftin&ioh, and for whom he had provided extraordi- 
narily ; and had therefore fent on Board the Boat over 
Night, a larger Store of Provisions than ufual ; and 
had ordered me to get ready three Fuiees with Pow- 
der and Shot, which Were on Board his Ship ; for that 
they deflgn'd fome fpojt of Fowling as well as Fifliing. 

I got all things ready as he had dire&ed, and waited 
the next Morning with the Boat waihed clean, her An- 
tient and Pendants out, and every thing to accommo- 
date his Guefts ; when by and by my Patron came on 
Board alone, and told me his Guefts had put off going, 
Upon fome Bufinefs that fell out, and order'd me with 
tie Man and Boy, as ufual, to go out with the Boat and 
eatch them fortie Fifh, for that his Friends were to fup at 
JuliHofefejhe commanded too.that^s fooh as I had got fome 

Fifh, 



(19) 

¥ifh, I fhould bring it home to his Houfe : All whic& 
I prepared to do. 

This Moment my former Notions of Deliverance 
darted into my Thoughts ; for now I found I was like 
to have a little Ship at my Command; and my Ma- 
iler being gone, I prepared to furnifh my felf, not for 
fifhing Buflnefs, but for a Voyage ; tho' I knew not, 
neither did I fo much as confider whether I fhould fleer 5 
for any where to get out of that place was my Way* 

My firfl Contrivance was to make a Pretence to fpeak 
to this Moor r to get fomething for our Subfiflence on 
board ; for I told him we mud not prefume to eat of 
our Patron's Bread; he faid, that was true; {o he 
brought a large Basket of Rusk, or Bisket, of their kind f 
and three Jarrs with frefh Water into the Boat : I knew 
•where my Patron's Cale of Bottles flood, which it was 
etrident by the Make, were taken out of fome Eqgtijh 
'Prize ; and I convey'd them into the Boat while the 
Moor was on Shore, as if they had been there before, 
for our Matter : I conveyed alio a great Lump of Bees- 
Wax into the Boat, which weighed about half a Hun- 
dred Weight, with a parcel of Twine or Thread, a 
Hatchet, a Saw, and a Hammer, all which were of 
great ufe to us afterwards; efpecially the Wax to make 
Candles. Another Trick I try'd upon him, which he 
innocently came into alfo : His Name \v<i$*lfmael> whom 
they call Muly, or Moloy ; fo 1 callM to him, Moloy , faid 
I, our Patron's Guns are all on Board the Boat, can 
you not get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may 
kill fome Alcamtes (a Fowl like our Curlkus) for our 
felves, fori know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in the 
Ship? Yes, fays he, I'll bring fome ; accordingly he 
brought a great Leather Pouch, which held about a 
l^ound and a half of Powder, or rather more; and a- 
nother with Shot, that had five or fix Pound, with 
fome Bullets, and put all into the Boat : At the fame 
Time I had found fome Powder of my Matter's in the 
great Cabin, with which I filPd one of the large Bot- 
tles in the Cafe, which was almofl empty ; pouring what 
was in it into another : And thus furmfheA with every 
tiling needful, we faiPd out of the Port to fifli. The 



( *o ) 

Caftlc which is at the Entrance of the Port, knew 
^vho we were, and took no Notice of us \ and we 
were not above a . Mile out of the Port, before we 
haul'd in our Sail, and fet us down to fiih. The 
Wind blew from the N. N. E. which was contrary to 
my Defire ; for had it blown Southerly, I had been 
lure to have made the Coail: of Spain, and at leaft 
reach'd to the Bay of Cadi\ ; but my Reiolutions were, 
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that 
horrid Place where I was, and leave the reft: to Fate. 

After we had fifh'd fome time, and catch'd nothing, 
for when 1 had Fiih on my Hook I would not pull 
them up, that he might not fee them ; I {aid to the 
Moor, this will not do, our Mafter will not be thus 
ferv'd, we mufl Hand farther off: He thinking no 
liarm, agreed ; and being in the Head of the Boat, fet 
the Sails j and as I had the Helm, I run the Boat out 
near a League farther, and then brought her too, as if 
I would fiih ; when giving the Boy the Helm, I (lept 
forward to where the Mar was, and making as if I floop'd 
for fomething behind him, I took him by Surprize, 
with my Arm under his Twift, and tois'd him clear 
over-board into the Sea; he roie immediately, for lie 
fwam like a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd to be taken 
In, told me he would go all over the World with rue r 
He fwam fo ftrong after the Boat, that he would have 
reach'd me very quickly, there being but little Wind; 
upon which I ftep'd into the Cabin, and fetching one 
of the Fowling-Pieces, I prefented it at him, and told 
him, I had done him no Hurt, and if he would be qui- 
et, I would do him none : But faid I, you fwim well 
enough to reach the Shore, and the Sea is calm, make 
the c bell of your Way to Shore, and I will do you no 
Harm, but if you come near the Boat, Pll fhoot you 
thro' the Head ; for I am refolv'd to have my Liber- 
ty : So he turn'd himfelf about and fwam for the Shore, 
and I make no doubt but he reach'd it with Eafe, for 
he was an excellent Swimmer. 

I could have been content to have taken this Moor 
Vfith me, and have drown'd the Boy, but there was.no 
venturing td truft him : When he was gone, I turn'd 
to the Boy, who they call'd Kurj y and laid to him, Xu- 



ry, if you will be faithful to me, I'll make you a great 
Man \ but if you will not flroke your £ace to be 
true to me, that #, [wear by Mahomet and bU tether's 
Beard^l muft threw you into the Sea too \ the Boy 
fmil'd in my Face, and fpoke fo innocently, that I could 
not miftrufl him \ and fwure to be faithful to me, and 
go all over the W orld w ith me. 

While I was in View of the Moor that was fwiming > 
I flood out dire&ly to Sea, with the Boat, rather flret-' 
ching to Windward, that they might think me gone 
towards the Strait i-mouth. (as indeed any one that had 
been in their W 7 its mud ha' been fuppos'd to do ; ) for 
who would ha 5 iuppos'd we were iaiPd on to the South- 
ward to the truly Barbarian Coafl, where whole Na- 
tions of Negroes were fure to furround us with their 
Canoes, and deilroy us ; where we could never once go 
on Shore, but we ihould be devour' d by lavage Beafls, 
or more mercilefs Savagts of human Kind. 

But as ibon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I chang- 
ed my Courfe, and ileer'd dire&ly South and by Eail, 
bending my Courfe a little toward the Eail, that I 
might keep in with the Shore ; and having a fair frelh 
Gale of Wind, and a fmooth quiet Sea, i made fuch 
Sail, that I believe by the next Day at three a-Clock in 
the Afternoon, when I firft made the Land, I could 
not be lefs than 150 Miles South of Salle e> quite beyond 
the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions, or indeed of any 
other King thereabouts tor we law no People. 

Yet fuch was the Fright 1 had taken at the Moors, 
and the dreadful Apprehenilons I had of falling into 
their Hands, that I would not flop, or go on Shore, or 
come to an Anchor; the Wind continuing Fair, til] I 
had faiPd in that manner iive Days : And then theWind 
Aifting to the Southward, I concluded alio, that if a« 
ny of our VefTels were in Chafe of me, they alio would 
now give over ; fo I ventur'd to make to the Coail, and 
came to an Anchor in the Mouth of a little River, £ 
knew not what, or where', neither what Latitude, ' 
what Country, what Nation, or what River : ! neither 
faw, or defir'd to fee any People, the principal thing I 
wanted was freih Water. We came into this Creek in 
the Evening refolvingto fwitn on Shore as toon as it * 

was 



fyas dark, and difcover the Country 5 but as foon as it 
was quite dark, we heard fuch dreadful Noiles of the 
Barking, Roaring, and Howling of wild Creatures, of 
we knew not what Kinds, that the poor Boy was rea- 
dy to die with Fear, and begg'd of me not to go on Shore 
till Day. Well, Xury, faid I, then I won't; but it 
may be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as bad 
to us as thofe Cions ; then toe may give them the Jhoot 
Cun y fays Xury y laughing, make them run voey ; fuch 
Engtifl) Xury fpoke by converfing among us Slaves, 
However, I was glad to fee the Boy fo cheerful, and I 
gave him a Dram (out of our Patron's Cafe of Bot- 
tles) tochear him up: After all, Xurfs Advice was 
good, and I took it, we drop'd our little Anchor, and 
lay ftill all Night ; 1 fay ftill, for we flept none ; for 
in two or three Hours we faw vaft great Creatures 
we knew not what to call them) of many Sorts, came 
down to the Sea-fhore, and run into the Water, wal- 
lowing and wafhing themfelves for the Pleafure of 
cooling themfelves •, and they made fuch hideous How- 
lings and Yellings, that I never indeed heard the like* 

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fo was I 
too : But we were both worfe frighted when we heard 
*)ne mighty Creature come fwimming towards our Boat : 
we could not fee him, but. we might hear him by his 
blowing, to be a monftrous huge and furious Bead ; 
Xury faid it was a Lion, and it might be fo for ought 
I know : Poor Xury cried out to me to Weigh 
the Anchor and row away 5 no lays I, Xury, we can 
Hip our Cable with a Buoy to it, and go to Sea, they 
cannot- follow us far ; I had no fooner faid fo, but I 
perceiv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within two 
Oars length, which fomething furprized me; however, 
I immediately ftept to the Cabin-door, and taking up 
my Gun, iir'd at him, upon which he immediately 
turn'd about, and fwam towards the Shore again. 

But it was not poflible to defcribe the horrible Noifes, 
and hideous Cries and Howlings, that were raifed as 
well upon the Edge of the Shore, as higher within the 
Country, upon the Noife or Report of a Gun, a thing I 
have fome Reafon to believe thofe Creatures had never 
heard before. This convinced me, that there was no.

and how to venture on Shore in the Day, was another 1 
QuefHon too \ for to have fallen into the Hands of any 
of the Savages, had been as bad as to have fallen inta 
the hands of Lions and Tigers ; at lead we were equal- 
ly apprehenfi ve of the Danger of it. 

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on Shore 
fomewhere or other for Water, for we had not a Pint 
left in the Boat ; when or where to get to it, was the 
Point : Xury faid, If I would let him go on Shore with 
one of the Jarrs, he would find if there was any Water, 
and bring iome to me. I ask'd him, why he would go ? 
why I fliould not go, and he flay in the Boat ? The 
Boy anfwered with fo much AfFe&ion, that made me 
love him ever after. Says he, If wild Mans come y they 
eatme^ ycugowey. Well, Xury, laid I, we will both 
go, and if the wild Mans come, we will kill them, they 
fliall eat neither of us ; fo I gave Xury a Piece of Rusk- 
bread to eat, and a Dram out of our Patron's Cafe of 
Bottles, which I mentioned before, and we haul'd the 
Boat in as near the Shore, as we thought was proper, 
and waded on Shore ; carrying nothing but our Arms, 
and two Jarrs for Water. 

I did not care to go out of fight of the Boat, fear- 
ing the coming of Canoes with Savages down the River : 
But the Boy feeing a low Place, about a Mile up the 
Country, t ambled to it, and by-and-by I faw him come 
running towards me : I thought he was purfued by fome 
Savage, or frighted with fome Wild Beaft, and I run 
forward towards him, to help him ; but when I came 
nearer to him, I faw fomething hanging over his Shoul- 
ders, which was a Creature that he had fhot, like a Hare, 
but different in Colour, and longer Legs ; however, we* 
were very glad of it, and it was very good Meat *,but the 
great Joy that poor Xury came with, was to tell me he 
had found good Water, andfeen no wild Mans. 

But we found afterwards that we need not take fuch 
!Pains for Water, for a little higher up the Creek where 
we were, we found the Water frefh when the Tide was 
out, which flows but a little Way up \ fo we filled our 
Jarrs and feared on the Hare we had killed, and pre- 

pave4

pared to go on our Way, having feen no Foot-fteps of 
any human Creature in that part of the Country. 

As i had been one Voyage to this Coail before, I 
knew very Well that the 1 Hands or the Canaries^ and the 
Cape de Vsrd I (lands alio, lay not far off from the Coail. 
But as I had notlnftruments to take an Obiervation to 
know what Latitude we were in, and did not exa&ly 
know, or at leafl not remember, what Latitude they were 
in, 1 knew not where to look for them, or when to Hand 
off to Sea towards~them, otherwife I might now ealily 
have found fome of thefe I Hands. But my Hope was 
that if I flood along this Coail till I came to that Part 
where the Eng^ifh traded, I fhould find fome of their 
V effete upon their uiiial Defign of Trade, that would 
relieve and take us in. 

By the bell of my Calculation, that Place where I 
now was, muil bs that Country, which lying between 
the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the Negroes 3 
lies wafte and uninhabited, except by Wild Beads ; the 
Negroes having abandoned it, and gone farther South, 
for fear of the Moors ; and the ivsoors not thinking it 
worth inhabiting, by Reafon of its Barranneis; and 
indeed both foriaking it becaufe of the prodigious Num- 
bers of Tygers, Lyons, Leopards, and other furious 
Creatures which harbour there; Co that the Moors ufe 
it for their Hunting only, where they go like an Army, 
two or three thoufand Men at a time ; and indeed for 
near an hundred Miles together upon this Coall, we 
faw nothing but a wafte uninhabited Country by Day, 
and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of Wild 
Beads by Night. 

( Once or twice in the Day-time, I thought T faw the 
Ft co of Tenerijf'e, being the high Top of the Mountain 
Tener'tffe in the Canaries ; and had a great mind to ven- 
ture out in Hopes of reaching thither ; but having tri- 
ed twice, I was forced in again by contrary Winds, the 
Sea a Ifo going too high for my little VefTel ; fo I >e- 
folv'd to purfue my fird Defign, and keep along the 
Shore. 

Several times we were obliged to land for frelh Water, 
after we had left this Place; and once in particular, be- 
ing early in the Morning, we came to an Anchor under 



(*5 ) 

a little Point of Land, which was pretty high, and the 
Tide beginning to flow, we lay ilill to go farther in. 
Xurj/y whole Eyes were more about him than it feems 
I mine were, calls foftly to me, and tells me, that we had 
1 beft go farther off the Shore ; for, fays he, look yonder 
I lies a dreadful Monfler on the Side o£ that Hillock, fad 
I afleep. I look'd where he pointed, arid faw a dreadful 
I Monfler indeed *, for it was a terrible great Lion, that 
I lay on the fide of the Shore, under the Shade of a piece 
of the Hill, that hung as it were a little ovei* him. Xwy f 
fays I, you fhall go on Shore, and kill him : Xury look'd 
frighted, and laid, Me kill ! he eat me at one Mcuth ; 
one Mouthful he meant ; however, I faid no more to the 
Boy, but bad him be dill, and took our biggefl: Gun, 
which was almoft Musket-bore, and loaded it with a 
good Charge of Powder, and with two Slugs, and laid 
it down ; then I loaded another Gun with two Bullets, 
and the third ( for we had three Pieces) I loaded with 
five lmaller Bullets. I took the belt Aim I could with 
the iirft Piece to have fhot him into the Head ; but he 
lay fo with his Leg rais'd a little above his Nofe, that 
the Slugs hit his Leg about the Knee, and broke the 
Bone, He ftarted up growling at firft:, but, finding his 
Leg broke, fell down again, and then got up upon three 
Legs, and gave the moft hideous Roar that ever I heard. 
I was a little furprized, that I had not hit him on the 
Head ; however, I took up the fecond Piece immediate- 
ly ; and tho' he began to move off, nYd again, and fhot 
him into the Head, and had the Pleafure to fee him 
drop, and making but little Noife, he lay ftruggling 
for Life. Then Xury took Heart, and would have me 
let him go on Shore. Well, go, faid I. So the Bq^ 
jump'd into the Water, and taking the little Gun in one 
Hand, fwam to Shore with the other Hand ; and com- 
ing dofe to the Creature, put the Muizle of the Piece 
to his Ear, and fhot him into the Head again, which 
difpatched him quite. 

This was Game indeed to us, but this was no Food; 
and I was very forry, to lofe three Charges of Powder 
and Shot upon a Creature that was good for nothing to 
us. However, Xury laid, he would have fome of him ; 
fo he comes on board, and ask'd me to give him the 

C Hatchets 



( %6 ) 

hatchet. For what, Xury, faid I? Me cut off hh Hea^ 
faid he. However, Xury could not cut off his Head; 
but he cut off a Foot, and brought it with him, and it 
was a monftrous great one. 

I bethought my felt' however, that perhaps the Skin 
of him might one way or other be of fome Value to us; 
and I refolv'd to take off his Skin if I could. So Xury 
and I went to work with him ; but Xury was much the 
better Workman at it, for 1 knew very ill how to do it* 
Indeed it took us up (both) the wholeDay, but at lait we 
got off the Hide of him, and fpreading it on the top of 
our Cabin, the Sun effe&ually dried it in two Days 
time, and it afterwards ferv'd me to lie upon. 

After this Stop, we made on to the Southward con- 
tinually for ten or twelve Days*, living very fparingly on 
our ProvifionSj which began to abate very much, and 
|>oing no oftner in to the Shore than we were obliged 
€o for frefli Water. My Defign in this, was to make 
the River Gambia or Senegall, that is to fay, any where 
about the Cape ck Verd, where I was in hopes to meet 
with ^oixiq Eifrcpean Ship, and if I did not, 1 knew not 
what Courfe I had to take, but to feek for the Ijlands, or 
perifti there among the Negroes. I knew that all the 
Ships (rom-'Eurcpe, which fail'd either to the Coaft of 
43uiney> or to Brafil 9 or to the Eaji Indies, made this Cape, 
or thofe I/lands *, and in a word, I put the whole of my 
Fortune upon this fingle Point, either that I mufl meet 
with fome Ship, or mail perifh. 

When I had purfued this Refoluion about ten Days 
longer, as I have laid., I began to fee that the Land 
was inhabited, and in two or three Places as we failed 
bf tj we faw People ftand upon the Shore to look at us ; 
we could alfo perceive they were quite black and ftark 
naked. I was once inclined to have gone on Shore to 
to them ; but X<#y was my better Ccunfellor, and faid 
tome, No go, no go-: However, I haufd in nearer the 
Shore, that I might talk to them, and I found they run 
along the Shore by me a good way. Iobferv'd they 
bad no Weapons in their Hands, except one, who had 
a long (lender Stick, which Xary faid was a Lance, and 
that they would throw them a great way with good 
Aim-f Iq I kept at a diftance, but talk'd with them by 

Signs 



( »7 ) 

Signs as well as I could, and particularly made Signs for 
fomething to eat. They beckon'd to me to (lop my 
Boat, and they would fetch me fome Meat. Upon this 
I lower'd the Top of my Sail, and lay by ; and two of 
them run up into the Country, and in lets than half an 
Hour came back and brought with them two Pieces of 
dry Flefh, and fome Corn, fuch as is the Produce of 
their Country ; but we neither knew what the one or 
the other was : However, we were willing to accept it. 
But how to come at it, was our next Difpute ; for I wai 
not for venturing on Shore to them, and they were as 
much afraid of us ; but they took a fafe Way for us all, 
for they brought it to the Shore and laid it down 5 and 
went and flood a great way off, till we fetch'd it on 
Board, and then came dole to us again. 

We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had no- 
thing to make them amends : But an Opportunity of- 
fer'd that very Inftant, to oblige them wonderfully ; for 
while we were lying by the Shore, came two mighty 
Creatures, one purfuing the other ( as we took it ) with 
£reat Fury, from the Mountains towards the Sea ; whe- J 
ther it was the Male purfuing the Parnate, or whether 
they were in Sport, or in Rage, we could not tell any 
more than we could tell whether it was ufual or ftrange; 
but I believe it was the latter, becauie in the firft place 
thole ravenous Creatures feldom appear but in the 
Night ; and in the iecond place, we found the People 
terribly frighted, efpecially the Women. The Man that 
had the Lance or Dart, did not Ry from them, but the 
reft did; however, as the two Creatures ran dire<ftly 
into the W T ater, they did net feem to offL-r to fall upon 
the Negroes, bat plung'd themfelves into the Sea, «nd 
fwam about as if they had come for their Diver fion ; 
at laft one of them began to come nearer our Boat than 
at firft I expe&ed, but I lay ready for him ; for I bad 
loaded my Gun with all pof&ble Expedition, and bid 
Xury load both the other : As foon as he came fairly 
within my Reach, I fir'd, and fhotbim dire&ly into the 
Head : Immediately he funk down into the Water, but 
rofe initantly, andplung'd up and down as if he was 
ilruggling for Life; and {o indeed he was; He imme- 
diately made to the Shore, but between the Wound, 
C 2 whica 



( *8 ) A 

which was Ins mortal Hurt, and the Wrangling of th$ 
Water, he died juft before hereach'dthe Shore. ? 

It is impoilible to exprefs the Aftonifhment of thefe 
poor Creatures, at the Noile and the Fire of my Gun ; - 
i'ome of them were ready even to die for Fear, and 
tell down as dead with the very Terror. But when 
they law the Creature dead, and funk in the Wateif 
and that I made Signs to them to come to the Shore, 
they took Heart, and came to the Shore, and began to 
iearch for the Creature I found him by his Blood 
ftaining the Water, and by the help of a Rope,' which 
I flung round him, and gave the Negroes to haul, they 
dragg'd him on Shore, and found that it was a moil 
curious Leopard, fpotted and fine, to an admirable de- 
gree ; and the Negroes held up their Hands with Admi- 
ration, to think what it was 1 had kill'd him with. 

The other Creature, frighted with the Flafh of Fire 
and the Noife of the Gun, Twam to the Shore, and ran up 
dire&ly to the Mountains, from whence they came, 
nor could I at that diftance know what it was. I foun4 
quickly the Negroes were for eating the Fleih of this 
Creature, fo I was willing to have them take it as a 
Favour from me, which when I made Signs to them 
that they might take him, they were very thankful 
for. 1 mmediately they fell to work with him ; and 
tho' they had no Knife, yet with a fliarpened piece of 
Wood, they took off his Skin as readily, and much more 
readily thin we would have done with a Knife ; they 
oiFer'd me fome of the Flefa, which I declin'd, mak- 
ing as if I would give it them, but made Signs for the 
£kin, which they gave me very freely, and brought me 
a great deal more of their Pro vifion, which tho 5 I did 
not underftand, yet I accepted. Then I made Signs to 
them for fome Water, and held out one of my Jars to 
them, turning it Bottom upward, to fhew that it was 
empty, and that I wanted to have it filled : They calPd 
immediately to fome of their Friends, and there came 
two Women and brought a great VefTel made of IJarth, 
and burnt, as I fuppofe, in the Sun \ this they fet down 
for me, as before, and I fent Xury on Shore with my 
Jars, and filled them all three. The Women were as 
ftark naked as the Men. 

I 



( *9 7 

I was now furnifli'd with Roots and Corn, fueh as It 
was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Negroe$> I 
made forward for about eleven Days more, without of- 
fering to go near the Shore, till I law the Land run out 
a great length into the Sea, at about the didance of four 
or five Leagues before me, and the Sea being very cahn f 
I kept a large Offing to make this Point ; at length, 
doubling the Point at about two Leagues from the Land, 
I faw plainly Land on the other fide to Seaward ; then 
I concluded, as it was mod certain indeed, that this 
was the Cape de Verd, and thofe the [(lands, called from 
thence Cape de Verd lflands. However, they were at a 
great Didance, and I could not well tell what I had bed 
to do ; for if I fhould be taken with a Frefh of Wind, 
I might neither reach one or other. 

In this Dilemma, as I was verv penfive, I dept into 
the Cabin, and fat me down, Xury having the Helm, 
when on a fudden the Boy cry'd out, Mafter, Afafter, a 
Ship with a Sail ! and the foolifh Boy was frighted out: 
of his Wits, thinking it mud needs be fame of' his Ma- 
iler's Ships fent to purfue us , when I knew we were got- 
ten far enough out of their Reach. I jumped out of the 
Cabin, and immediately faw not only the Ship, but 
what fhe was, (viz) that it was a Portuguefe Ship, and as 
I* thought, was bound to the Coad ofGuiney for Negroes : 
But when I obferv'd the Courfe fhe deer'd, I was foon 
convine'd they were bound fome other Way, and did 
not defign to come any nearer the Shore ; upon which I 
ftretch'd out to Sea as much as I could, refolving to 
fpeak with them if poflible. 

With all the Sail I could make, I found I fhould not 
Be able to come in their Way, but that they would # Ije 
gone by y before I could make any Signal to them ; 
but after I had crowded to the utmod, and began 
to defpair, they it feems faw me by the help of their 
Perfpeftive GlafTes, and that it was fbme European Boat, 
which they fupposM mud belong to fome Ship that was 
lbd ; Co they fliortened Sail to let me come up. I was 
encouraged with this, and as I had my Patron's Anti- 
enton board, I made a Waft of it to them for a Signal 
of Didrefs, and fir'd a Gun, both which they faw, for 
they told me they faw* the Smoke, tho' they did not 
C 3 hear 



( 3o ) 

liear the Gun ; ttpon thefe Signals they very kindly 
brought to, and lay by for me, and in about three Hours 
time I came up with them. 

They ask'd me what I was, in Vortuguefe, and in Spa- 
nijh, and in French, but I underftood none of thern ; but 
at laii a Sects Sailor who was on board, ca-ll'd to me, and 
I aniwer'd him., and told him I was an Englijbman, that 
had made my Eleape out of Slavery from the Moors at 
Sallee j then they bad me come on board, and very 
kindly took me in, and all my Goods. 

It was an inexpreiFible Joy to me, that any one will be- 
lieve; that I was thus deliver'd 5 as I efteem'd it, from fuch 
amiierahle and alrnoil hopelels Condition as I was in i 
I immediately oifer'd all 1 had to the Captain of the 
Ship, as a Return for my Deliverance ; but he generouf- 
lj told me, he would take nothing from me, but that all I 
bad ihould be deliver 3 d fafe to me whenl came to theBra- 
fth ; for, fays he, / have fav dy 'cur Life on no other Terms \\,. 
than as I would be glad to he Javed my felf, and it may 
in? time or other be my Let to be taken up in the fame Con- 
dition \ befides, faid he, when 1 carry you to the Brafils, jo 
great a may \r cm your own Country, ijl Jhould take jromyu 
what little %ou have y y on will be flawed there? and then 1 only 
take away that Life I have given* No, no, Seignicr Ingiefe 
fays he, [Mr. Englrihman,] I will carry you thither in- 
Chaiiiy^ and thefe 1 tjings will help you to buy your Subfftence 
tbere,n nd your Pajfage h me again* 

As he was -charitable in this Propofal, fo he was juft 
in the Performance to a Tittle, for he ordered tile bea- 
men, that none ihould oifer to touch any thing I had ; 
then he took every thing into his own Pofielhon, and 
gave me back an exa£ Inventory of them, that I might 
have them again, eveafo much as my three Earthen Jars. 

As to my Boat, it was a very good one, and that he 
few, and told me he would buy it of me for the Ship's 
ttie, and ask'd me what I would have for it ? I told him 
he had been fo generous to me in every thing, that I 
could not offer to make any Price of the Boat, but left 
it entirely to him ; upon which he told me he would 
give me a Note of his Hand to pay me So Pieces of 
Eight for it at Brafil, and when it came there, if any 
one offer'd to Rive more, he would make it up j he of- 
fer'd 



(30 

fer'd me alfo 3o Pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xurfy 
which I was loth to take ; not that I was not willing to 
let the Captain have him, but I was very loth to fell 
the poor Boy's Liberty, who had affiiled me fo faithful- 
ly in procuring my own. However, when I let him 
know my Reaibn, he own'd it to be jiift, and offer' d me 
this Medium, that he would give the Boy an Obligation 
to fet him free in 10 Years, if heturn'd Chriftan: Upon 
this, and Xury faying he was willing to go to him, 1 let 
the Captain have him. 

We had a very good Voyage to the Brafils, and arriv'd 
in the Bay, de Tcdos lot Santo s> ox All- Saints- Bay >'m about 
22 Days after. And now I was once more deliver'd from 
the moil miierable of all Conditions of Life, and what 
to.do next with my fel£ I was to conilder. 

The generous Treatment the Captain gave me, I can 
never enough remember ; he would take nothing of ma 
for my Paflfage, gave me 20 Ducats for the Leopard's 
Skin, and 40 for the Lion's Skin which I had in the Boat, 
and caufed every Thing I had in the Ship to be puiw 
dually deliver'd me, and what I was willing to ihU y be 
bought ; fueh as the Cafe of Bottles 5 two of my Guns,and 
a Piece of the Lump of Bees- wax, for I had made Can- 
dles of the reft ; in a word, I made about 220 Pieces of' 
Eight of all my Cargo, and with this Stock I went on 
Shore in the Brafils* 

I had not been long here, but being recommended to 
the Houfe of a good honed Man like himfelf, who had 
an Ingenio, as they call it ; that is, a Plantation and & 
Sugar-Houfe, I liv'd with him fome time, and acquain- 
ted my felf by that Means with the Manner of thei* 
Planting and making of Sugar ; and feeing how well tha 
Planters liv'd, and how they grew rich fuddainry * I 
refolv'd, if I could get Licence to fettle there, I woulct 
turn Planter among them reiolvingin the mean time to 
iind out fome Way to get my Money which I had left 
ia London, remitted to me. To this purpofe, getting, 
a kind of a Letter of NaturaU^ation y I purchafed as much 
Land that was Uncur'd, as my Money would reach, 
«md form'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settlement^ 
and fuch a one as might be fuitable to the Stock which I 
proposed to my felf to -receive from Engla/id* 



( 30 

I had a Neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon^ hut born of 
jEngHjb Parents, whoieName was IVeUs; and in muchfuch 
Circumftances as I was: I call him Neighbour, becauft? 
his Plantation lay next to mine, and we went on very 
fbciably together- My Stock was but low as well as his ; 
and wi rather planted for Food, than any thing elfe, 
for about two Years. However, we began to increafe, 
and oiw Land began to come into Order ; fo that tht 
third Year we planted fome Tobacco, and made each of 
us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting Canes in 
the Year to come *, but we both wanted Help; and now 
I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting 
with my Boy Xury. 

But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, 
was no great Wonder: I had no Remedy but to go on : 
I was gotten into an Employment quite remote to my 
Genius, and dire&ly contrary to the Life I delighted in, 
and for which I foriook my Father's Houfe, and broke 
thro' all his good Advice; nay, I was coming intothe 
very middle Station, or upper Degree of low Life, 
which my Father advifed me to before, and which, if 
I reiolved to go on with, I might as well have (laid at 
home, and never have fatigued my (elfin the World as I 
had done ; and I ufed often to fay to my felf, I could 
have done this as well in England among my Friends, as 
have gone 5000 Miles off to do it among Strangers and 
Savages in a Wildernefs, and at fuch a Diftance, as ne- 
ver to hear from any-Part of the World that had the lead 
Knowledge of me. 

In this manner T ufed to look upon my Condition 
with the utmoft Regret. I had no Body to converts 
with, but now and then this Neighbour ; no Work to 
be OTtie, but by the Labour of my Hands ; and I ufed 
to fay, I liv'd juft like a Man cad away upon fome defo- 
late I Hand, that had no Body there but himfelf. But 
how juft has it been, and how ihould all Men refle&, 
that, when they compare their prefent Conditions with 
others that are worfe, Heaven may oblige them to make 
the Exchange, and be convinced of their former Felici- 
ty, by their Experience : I fay, how iurt: has it been, that 
the truly folitary Life I refle&ed on in an Ifland of rneer 
Defolation fhould be my Lot, who had fo often unjuftly 

com* 



(33 ) 

compared it with the Life which I then led, in which 
had I continued, I had in all probability been exceeding 
profperous and rich. 

I was in fome Degree fettled in my Meafures for carry- 
ing on the Plantation, before my kind Friend the Cap- 
tain of the Ship, that took me up at Sea, went back ; 
for the Ship remained there in providing her Loading, 
and preparing for her Voyage, near three Months ; when 
telling him what little Stock I had left behind me in 
London, he gave me this friendly and ilncere Advice .• 
Seignior Ingle fe, fays he, (for fo he always cal?d me,) if 
you will give me Letters, and a Procuration here in form 
to me with Orders to the Perfon who has your Mo- 
ney in London, to fend your EfFe&s to Lisbon, to fuch 
Perfons as I fftall dire&, and in fuch Goods as are pro- 
per for this Country, I will bring you the Produce of 
them, God willing, at my Return ; but fince human 
Affairs are all fubjeft to Changes and Difafters, I 
would have you give Orders but for ioo /. StcrL which 
you fay is half your Stock, and let the hazard be run for 
the firft ; fo that if it come fafe, you may order the reft 
the fame way ; and if it mifcatry, you may have the o» 
ther half to have Recourfe to for your Supply. 

This was io wholfome Advice, and look'd Co friendly, 
that I could not but be convinc'd it was the beft Courfe 
I could take ; fo I accordingly prepared Letters to the 
Gentlewomen with whom I had left my Money, and a 
Procuration to the Vortuguefe Captain, as he deilred. 

I wrote the EngUJh Captain's Widow a full Account 
of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Efcape, and how t 
had met with the Portugal Captain at Sea, the Huma- 
nity of his Behaviour, and in what Condition I t w,as 
now in, with all other neceftary Dire&ions for my Sup- 
ply; and when this honeft Capt. came to Lisbon, he found 
means by fome of the Englijh Merchants there, to fend o- 
ver not the Order only, but a full Account of my Story 
to a Merchant at London, whoprefented it effe&ually to 
her \ whereupon the not only delivered the Money, buc 
out of her own Pocket fent the Portugal Captains very 
handlbme Prefent for his Humanity and Charity to me. 

The Merchant in London vefted this ico /. in Englifb 
Goodsjfuch as the Captain had writen for ; fent them di- 

re&lv 



( 34 ) 

reftly to him at -Lisbon, and he brought them all fafe to 
ine to the Brafils ; among which, without my Dire&ion 
(for I was too young in my Buiineis to think of themj 
he had taken care to have all Sorts ot Tools, Iron-work,, 
and Uteniils nece/Iary for my Plantation, and which 
were of great Ufe to me. 

When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortune made, 
for I was furpriz'd with thejoy or it ; and my goodStew- 
ard the Captain had laid out the 5 /. which my Friend 
had fent him for a Prefent for himfeH, to purchafe, and 
bring me over a Servant under Bond for fix Years Ser- 
vice, and would nor accept of any Confideration, except 
a little Tobacco, which 1 would have him accept, being 
of my own Produce. 

Neither was this all ; but my Goods being all Englrjh 
Manufactures, fuch as Cloth, Stuff, Bays, and Things 
particularly valuable and defirable in the Country, I 
found means to fell them to a very great Advantage ; fo 
that I may fay, I had more than four times the Value 
of my iirft Cargo, and was now infinitely beyond my 
poor Neigbour, 1 mean in the Advancement of my Plan- 
tation •, for the £rft Thing I did, I bought me a Nt- 
groe Slave, and an European Servant alfo ; i mean ano- 
ther befides that which the Captain brought me from 
Lisbon* 

But as abufed Profperity is oftentimes made tie very 
Means of our greateft Adverilty, fo was it with me, t 
went on the next Year with great Succefs in my Planta- 
tion : I rai fed 50 great Rolls of Tobacco on my own 
Ground more than 1 had difpofed of for NecefTaries a- 
*»ong my Neighbours •, and thefe 50 Rolls being each 
of above a 100 lb. Wt^ were well cur ? d and laid by, a- 
gainft the Rettara of the Fleet Irom Lisbon* And now 
Increaflng in Bufinefs and Wealth, my Head began to be 
full of Proje&s and Undertakings beyond my Reach ; 
fuch as are in deed often the Ruin of the the beft Heads 
in Bufinels. 

Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I had 
.'room for all the happy Things to have yet befallen me, 
for which my Father fo earned y recommended a quiet 
retired Life, and which be had h feniibly defcribed 
ihe middle Station of- Life to W full of 5 but othei? 

Things 



r 3t y 

Things* attended me, and I was dill to be the wilful A> 
gent of all my own Mi(eries*,and particularly to encreafe 
my Faulty and double theReiledtions upon my, Ielf which 
in my tuture Sorrows I ibould have Leilure to make : 
All thefeMi {carriages were procured by my apparent ob- 
ftinate adhering to my foolifh Inclination or wandring 
abroad, and purfuing that Inclination, in Contradiction, 
to the cleared Views of doing my ielf good in a fair and 
plain Puriuit of thofe Proipe&s and thole Meafures of 
life, which Nature and Providence concurred to pre- 
fe'nt me with, and to make my Duty* 

As I had once done thus in breaking away from my 
Parents, h \ could not be content now, but I mud go 
and leave the happyViewf had,of being a rich and a thri- 
ving Man in my new Plantation, only to purfue a rails.., 
arid immoderate Defire of rifing fader than the Nature 
of the Things admitted; and thus I call my ielf down 
again into the deeped Gulph of human Mifery that ever 
Man M]into 3 or perhaps could be confident with Life 
and a State of Health in the World. 

To come then by juft Degrees to the Particulars of 
this Part of my Story ; You may lii^pofe, that having 
now lived almoft four Years in the Brafils y and begin- 
ning to thrive and profper very well upon my Planta- 
tion, I had not only learned the Language, but had con- 
tracted Acquaintance and Friendfhip among my Felr 
low- Planters, as well as among the Merchants at- St.- 
Salvadre, which was our Port; and that in my Di(~ 
cburfe among them, I had frequently given them an ac- 
count of my two Voyages to the Coaft of Gutney^ the 
manner of Trading with the Negroes there, andhoweafy 
it was to purchafe upon the Coaft, forTrMes (fuchas 
Btads r Tc)s 9 Knives, Saffars^ Hatcbsts, Bits of &lafs y 
and the like) not only Gold-Duft> Guimy-Grahis, Ek* 
phMts-Teetby $5c. but Negroes for the Service of the 
Brafihy in great Numbers. 

They liftened always very attentively to my Difcour- 
fes on thefe Heads, but efpecially to that part which re- 
lated to the buying Negroe s y which was a Trade at that: 
time not or\\y not far entered into, but as far as it was, 
had been carried on by the Affiento's, or Permiflion, of* 
tiie Rings of *%*m and" Portugal $ and engrofs'd in rfifc- 
* ' JPubi 



( 36 ) 

Publick Stock ; Co that few Negroes were brought, and 
thofe exceflive dear. 

It happen'd, being in Company one Day with fome 
Merchants and Planters of my Aquaintance,and talking of 
thofe things very earneftly,three of them came to me the 
next Morning, and told me they had been mufing very 
mu?h upon what I had diteourled of with them the lad 
Kight, and they came to make a fecret Propolal to me, 
and after enjoining me Secrecy, they told me that they 
had a mind to fit out a Ship to go to Guiney \ that they 
had all Plantations as well as I, and were ftraitned for 
nothing fo mu^h as Servants; that as it was a Trade 
that could not publickly fell the Negroes when they 
came home, fo they defired to make but one Voyage, 
to bring the Negroes on Shore piivately, and divide 
them among their own Plantations ; and in a Word, the 
Queftion was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in 
the Ship, to manage the Trading Part upon the Coaffc 
of Guiney? And they offer'd me that I ihould have my 
equal Share of the Negroes, without providing any Part 
of the Stock. 

This was a fair Propofal, it mud be confefs-d, had it 
been made to any one that had not had a Settlement and 
Plantation of his own to look after, which was in a fair 
way; of coming to be very conflderable, and with a good 
Sto k upon it. But for me that was thus eftabliih'd, 
and had nothing to do but go on as I had begun, for 
three or four Years more, and to have fent for the other 
100/. from England and who in that Time, and with 
that little Addition, eculd fcarce have faiFd of being 
worth 3 or 4000 /. Ster ling^ and that encreafing too; 
for me to think of fu:h a Voyage, was the mod prepof- 
teroiis* thing that ever Man in fuch Circumftances could 
be guilty of. 

But I that was born to be my own Deflroyer, could 
no more refill the Offer than I could reftrain my firft 
rambling Oefigns, when my Father's good Ccunfel was 
was loft upon me. In a Word, I told them I would 
go with all my Heart, if they would undertake to look 
after my Plantation in my Abfence, and would difpofe 
6\' it to ( u:h as . T fhould direct, if I mifcarried. This* 
they all engaged to do, and entered into Writings, or 
?. , % '*". " Cove-'" 



(37) 

Covenants, to do fo ; and I made a formal Will, difpo- 
fing of my Plantation and Effe&s, in cafe of my Death, 
making the Captain of the Ship that had fav'd my Life, 
as before, my univerfal Heir, but obliging him to dif- 
pofe of my EfFe&sas I had dire&ed in my Will, one 
half of the Produce being to himfelf, and the other to 
be ihipp'd to England. 

In fliort, I took all pofllble Caution to preferve my 
EiFe&s, and to keep up my Plantation ; had I ufed half 
as much Prudence to have look'd into my own intereft, 
and have made a Judgment of what I ought to have 
done, and not to have done, I had certainly never gone 
away from fo profperous an Undertaking, leaving all the 
the probable Views of a thriving Circumftance, and 
gone upon a Voyage to Sea, attended with all its com- 
mon Hazards ; to fay nothing of the Reafons I had to 
expe& particular Misfortunes to my felf. 

But I was hurried on, and obey'd blindly the Dic- 
tates of my Fancy rather than my Reafon : And accord- 
ingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Cargo furnifh'd, 
and all things done as by Agreement, by my Partners in 
the Voyage, I went on board in an evil Hour again, 
the i ft of Sept* 1659, being the fame Day eight Years 
that I went from my Father and Mother at HuU 9 in or- 
der to ad the Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to 
my own Intereft. 

Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried 6 
Guns and 14 Men, befides the Mafter, his Boy, and 
my felf 5 we had on board no large Cargo of Goods, 
except of lueh Toys as were fit for our Trade with the 
Negroes, fuch as Beads, Bits of Glafs, Shells, and odd 
Trifles, efpeciaily little Looking-GlafTes, Knives, Scif- 
fars, Hatchets, and the like. 

The fame Day I went on board, we fet Sail, {landing 
away to the Northward upon our own Coaft, with 
dedgn to ftretch over for the African Coaft, When 
they came into about io or 12 Degrees of Norther nJLiti- 
tube, which it Teems was the manner of their Courfe 
in 'thole Days : We had very good Weather, only excef- 
five hot, all the Way upon our own Coaft, till we came 
to the Height of Cape St. AugufUnc, from whence keep- 
ing farther off at Sea, we loft fight of Land, and fteer'd 

as 



( 38 ) 

as- if we were bound for the Ifle Fernandde Noronha, hold- 
ing our Ccurfe N.E. by N. and leaving thole lilts en 
the Eaft. In this Courfe we pad the Line in about 1 2 
Days time, and were by our tail Gbiervation in 7 De- 
grees 22 Ivdm. Northern Latitude, when a violent Trzir- 
nado r r Hurricane, took us quite out of our Knowledge ; 
it began from the South- Eaii, came abcut to the North- 
Weft, and then fettled into the North. Eaft, from 
whence it blew in fuch a terrible manner, that for 1 2 Days-. 
together we could do nothing but drive ; and fcudding a- 
way before it, let it carry us wherever Fate and the 
Irury of the Winds dire&ed ; and during theie 1 2 Days, I 
need not fay, thatlexpe&ed every Day to be (wallowed 
up, nor did any in the Ship expe<& to lave their Lives, j 

In this Diftrefs we had, beiides the Terror of the 
Storm, one of cur Men died of the Calenture, and one 
Man and the Boy waih'd over-board. About the 12th 
Day the Weather abating a little, the Mailer made an 
Obfervation as well as he could, and found that he was 
in about 1 1 Degrees North Latitude, but that he was 
22 Degrees of Longitude Difference Weft from Cape St. 
Augujttno, fo that he found he was- gotten upon the Coaft 
of Guiana, or the North Part of Brafil, beyond the 
River Amazwes, toward that of the River Qrooncque, 
commonly called the Great River 5 and now he began 
to confult with me what Ccurfe he ihould take, for the 
Ship was leaky, and very much difabled, and he was- 
for going dire&ly back to the Coaft of Braftl. 

I was pofltively agairiff that, and looking over the 
Charts of the Sea-Coaft of America with him, we con- 
cluded there was no inhabited Country for us to have 
recc&rfe to, till we came within the Circle of the Canb- 
bee Ijlands, and therefore refolved to ftand away forZter- 
badoes, which by keeping off at Sea, to avoid the In- 
draught of the Bay or Gulph of Mexico, we might eafily 
perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen Days Sail ; where- 
as, we could not pcffibly make our Voyage to the Coaft 
of Africa, without fame Affiftance both to our Ship an& 
to our felves. 

With this Defign we changed our Courfc, and fteer'ct 
away N. W. by vV» in order to reach fome of our En- 
/i/JIflaads, where Ihoped for Relief; but our Voyage* 

was 



( 39 ) 

was otherwife determined, for being in the Latitude of 
1 2 Deg. i8.Min. alecondStorm came upon us, which 
carry'dus away with the fame Impetuofity Wedward,. 
and drove us lb out of the very way of all human Com- 
rnerce, that had all our Lives been laved, as to the Sea 
we were rather in danger of being devoured by ravages, 
than ever returning to oitr own Country. 
. In this Didrets, the Wind dill blowing very hard, 
one of cur Men, early one Morning, cn'd out, land^ 
and we had no fooner run out of the Cabin to look out, 
in hopes of feeing whereabouts in the World we were^ 
but the Ship druck upon a Sand, and in a Moment, her 
Motion being lb ftopp'd, the Sea broke over her in fuch 
a manner, that we expe&ed we Ihould all have perifn'd 
immediately; and we were even driven into our 
dole Quarters,* to fhelter us from the very Foam and 
Sprye of the Sea, 

It is not eafy for any one, who has not been in the 
like Condition, to defcribe or conceive the Condensa- 
tion of Men in fuch Circumdances ; we knew nothings 
where we were, or upon what Land it was we were 
driven, whether an I Hand or the Mai% whether inha- 
bited or not inhabited ; and as the Rage of the Wind 
was dill great, tho 9 rather lefs than at fird, we could 
not fo much as hope to have the Ship hold many Mi-* 
nutes without breaking in Pieces, unlefs the Winds by 
a kind of Miracle fhould turn immediately about. In 
a Word, we fat looking one upon another, and expec- 
ting Death every Moment, and every ft|an a£Hng ac- 
cordingly, as preparing, for another World ; for there 
was little or nothing more for us to do in this : That 
which was our prefent Comfort, and all the Comfort 
we had, was, that contrary to our Expe&ation the Ship 
did not break yet, and that the Mader faid the Wind 
began to abate. 

Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little 
abate, yet the Ship having thus druck upoa the Sand, 
and flicking too fad for us to expe& her getting off, 
we were in a dreadful Condition indeed, and had no- 
thing to do but to think of faving our Lives as well as 
we could. We had a Boat at our Stern, jud before the 
Storm, hit fee was firft ftay'd by daihingagaind the 

Ship's 



C 40 ) 

Ship's Rudder, and in the next Place flie broke awayi 
and either funk or was driven off to Sea, fo there was 
no Hope from her : We had another Boat on board, 
but how to get her ofF into the Sea, was a doubtful 
thing ; however, there was no room to debate, for 
we tancied the Ship would break in pieces every 
Minute*, and fome told us, fee was adlually broken 
already. 

In this Diftrefs the Mate of our VefTel lays hold of 
the Boat, and with the help of the reft of the Men, they 
got her flung over the Ship's fide, and getting all into 
*^% r > * et &°3 au( * comm itted our felves, being Eleven in 
** " tfumber, to God's Mercy, and the wild Sea ; for tho' 
the Storm was abated confiderably, yet the Sea went 
dreadrul high upon the Shore, and might well be call'd 
Den wild Zee, as the Dutch call the Sea in a Storm. 

And now our Cafe was very difmal indeed; for we 
all faw plainly, that the Sea went fo high, that the 
Boat could not live, and that we feould be inevitably 
drowned. As to making Sail, we had none, nor, if we 
had, could we have done any thing with it ; fo we 
work'd at the Oar towards the Land, tho* with heavy 
Hearts, like Men going to Execution ; for we all knew, 
that whenthe Boat came nearer the Shore, fhe would 
be dafh'd in a thoufand Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. 
However, we committed our Souls to God in the mofl 
* earneft manner, and the Wind driving us towards the 
Shore, we haften'd our Deftru&ion with our own Hands, 
pulling as well as we could towards Land. 

What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand, whether 
Steep or Shoal, we knew not; the only Hope that could 
rationally give us t]ie leaft Shadow of Expe&ation, was, 
if We niight happen into fome Bay or Gulph, or the 
Mouth ofibme River, where by great Chance we might 
have run our Boat in, or got under the Lee of the Land, 
and perhaps made fmooth W T ater. But there was no- 
thing of this appeared ; but as we made nearer and 
nearer the Shore, the Land look'd more frightful than 
the Sea, 

After we had row'd, or rather driven about a 
League and a hal£ as we reckoned it, a raging Wave, 
Mountain-like, came rowling a-ftern of us, aad plainly 

bid 



( 4i ) 

bid us exped the Coup de Grace* In a word, it took us 
with fuch a Fury, that it overfet the Boat at once, and 
feparating us as well from the Boat, as from one an- 
other, gave us not time hardly to fay, O God ! for we 
were all fwallowed up in a Moment. 

Nothing can defcribe the Confufion of Thought 
which I felt when I funk into the Water ; for tho 1 I 
fwam very well, yet I could not deliver my felf from 
the Waves fo as to draw Breath, till that Wave hav- 
ing driven me, or rather carried me a vaft Way on to- 
wards the Shore, and having fpent it felf, went back, 
and left me upon the Land almoft dry, but half dead 
with the Water I took in : I had fo much Prefence of 
Mind, as well as Breath left, that feeing my felf nearer 
the main Land than I expe£ed, I got upon my Feet, 
and endeavoured to make on towards the Land as fail 
as I could, before another Wave fhould return, and take 
me up again. But I foon found it was impoflible to 
#void it; for I faw the Sea come after me as high as a 
great Hill, and as furious as an Enemy, which I had 
m Means or Strength to contend with ; my Bufinefs 
was to hold my Breath, and raife my felf upon the 
Water, if I could, and fo by fwimrning to preferve my 
Breathing, and pilot my felf towards the Shore, if pof- 
iible ; my greateft Concern now being, that the Sea, as 
it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore when 
it came on, might not carry me back again with it 
when it gave back towards the Sea. 

The Wave that came upon me again, buried me at 
once 20 or 30 Foot deep in its own Body; and I could 
feel my felf carried with a mighty Force and Swittneis 
towards the Shore a very great Way ; but 1 held my 
Breath, and aflifted my felf to fwim flill forward will? 
all my Might. I was ready to buril with holding my 
Breath, when, as I felt my felf rifing up, fo, to my 
immediate Relief, I found my Head and Hands fhoot 
out above the Surface of the Water; and tho 5 it was 
not two Seconds of Time that I could keep my felf fo, 
yet it reliev'd me greatly, gave me Breath and new 
Courage. I was covered again with Water a good 
while, but not fo long but I held it out ; and finding the 
Water had fpent it fel£ and began to return, I ftruck 

forward 



( 4* ) 

forward againd the Return of the Waves, and felt 
Ground again with my Feet. I flood dill a few Mo- 
ments to recover Breath, and till the Water went from 
me, and then took to my Heels, and run with what 
Strength I had farther towards the Shore* But neither 
would this deliver me from the Fury of the Sea, which 
came pouring in after me again, and twice more I was.* 
lifted up by the Waves* and carried forwards as before, 
the Shore being very flat. 

The lad time of thefe two had well near been fatal 
to me ; for the Sea having hurried me along as before,, 
landed me, or rather daih'd me againd a piece of a 
Rock, and that with fuch Force, as it left me fenfelefs* 
and indeed helplefs, as to my own Deliverance; for the 
Blow taking my Side and Bread, beat the Breath as* 
it were quite out of my Body; and had it returned a- 
gain immediately, I mud have been drangled in the 
Water ; but I recover^ a little before the Return of the 
Waves; and feeing I fhould be Gover'd again with the 
Water, I refolv'd to hold fad by a piece of the Rock, 
and fo to hold my Breath, if poflible, till the Wave 
went back. Now as the Waves were not fo high as at 
fird, being near Land, I held my Hold, till the Wave 
abated^ and then fetch'd another Rtw, which brought 
me fo near the Shore, that the next Wave> though it 
went over me, yet did not fo fwallow me up, as to car- 
*y me away; and t e next Run I took, I got to the 
main Land, where, to my great Comfort, 1 clamber *d 
up the Clifts cf the Shore, and fat me down upon the 
Grafs, free from Danger, and quite out of the Reach 
of the Water. 

I was now landed, and fafe on Shore, and began to 
ltfok up and thank God, that my Life was fav*d in a 
Cafe wherein there was fome Minutes before fcarce any 
room to hope, I believe it is impoffible to exprefs to< 
the Life, what the Extafies and Tranfports of the Soul 
are, when it is fo faved, as I may fay, out of the very 
Grave ; and I do not wonder now at that Cudom, vi<>* 
That when a Malefa&or, who has the Halter about his 
Neck, is tied up. and juft going to be turn'd oflf, and 
has a Reprieve brought to him ; I fay, I do not won-* 
4er, that, they brings a Surgeon with it, tp let him Blood 

that 



( 43 ) 

that very Moment they tell him of it, that the Sur- 
prize may not drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart* 
and overwhelm him: 

Fcrfudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at firjf , 

I walk'd about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands, 
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the> 
Contemplation o^ my Deliverance, making a thoufand 
Geftures and Motions, which I cannot deieribe, reflec- 
ting upon all my Comrades that were drown'd, and 
that there fhould not he one Soul fav'd but my felf; 
for as for them, I never faw them afterwards, or any 
Sign of them, except three of their Hats, one Cap, and 
two Shoes, that were not Fellows. 

I caft my Eyes to the ftranded VeiTel 3 when the 
Breach and Froth of the Sea being fo big, I could hard- 
ly lee it, it lay fo far off, and confidered, Lord ! how 
was it poffible I could get on Shore ! 

After I had folac'd my Mind with the comfortable 
part of my Condition, I began to look round me, to 
lee what kind of Place I was in, and what was next to 
be done; and I loon found my Comforts abate, and that, 
in a Word, I had a dreadful Deliverance^ fori was 
wet, had no Cloaths to fhift me, nor any thing either 
to eat or drink to comfort me ; neither did 1 fee anjr 
Profpea: before me, but that of perifliing with Hunger, 
or being devoured by wildBeafts * And that which was 
particularly afli&ing to rae 3 was, that I had no Weapon 
either to hunt and kill any Creature for my Suftenanee, 
or to defend my fell againft any other Creature that 
might defire to kill me for theirs : In a Word, I had 
nothing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-pipe, aniu. 
little Tobacco in a Box: This was all my Provision, and 
this threw me into terrible Agonies of Mind, that for a 
while I run about like a Mad-man. Night coming up- 
on me, I began with a heavy Heart to confid.er what 
would be my Lot, if there were any ravenous Beads in 
that Country, feeing at Night they always come abroad 
for their Prey. 

^ All the Remedy that offer' d to my Thoughts at that 
time, wasj to get up into a thick buihy Tree like a Fir, 

but 



(.44) 

but thorsy, which grew near me, and where! refolv'd 
to fit all Night, and confider the next Day what Death 
I fhould die, for as yet I faw no Profpe& of Life. I 
walk'd about a Furlong from the Shore, to fee if I could 
iind any frefh Water to drink, which I did, to my 
great Joy; and having drank, and put a little Tobacco 
in my Mouth to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, 
and getting up into it, endeavoured to place my felfio, 
as that if I Ihould deep, I might not fall ; and having 
cut me a fhort Stick, like a Truncheon, for my De- 
fence, I took up my Lodging, and having been excef- 
fively fatigu'd, 1 fell fafl aileep, and flept as comfor- 
tably, as 1 believe few could t ave done in my Condi- 
tion, and found my felf the mod refreshed with it, that 
I think 1 ever was on fuch an Occafion. 

When I wak'd, it was broad Day, the Weather clear, 
and the Storm abated, fo that the Sea did not rage 
and fwell as before: But that which furpriz'd me 
mod, was, that the Ship was lifted off in the Night 
from the Sand where Ihe lay, by the Swelling of the 
Tide, and was driven up almoit as far as the Rock, 
which I firfl mention'd, where I had been lb bruis'd by 
the dafhing me againffc it ; this being within about 
a Mile from the Shore where I was, and the ^htp feem- 
ing to ftand upright frill, I wifh'd my felf on board, 
that, at leaft, I might fave fome neceifary Things For 
my Ufe. 

When I came down from my Apartment in the 
Tree, I look'd about me again, and the firfl thing I 
found, was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and the 
Sea had tofs'd her up upon the '^and, about two Miles 
on my Right Hand: I walk'd as far as I could upon 
tlie c Shore to have got to her, but found a Neck or .Inlet 
of Water between me and the Boat, which was about 
half a Mile broad ; {o I came back for the prefent, be- 
ing more intent upon getting at the Ship, where I hop'd 
to find fomething for my prefent Subflfrence. 

A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm, and 
the Tide ebb'd fo far out, that I could come within 
a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship: And here I found a 
frefh renewing of my Grief; for I faw evidently, that 
ii* we had kept on board, we had been all fafe, that is 

to 



( 45 ) 

to fay, we had all got fafe on Shore, and I had not 
been fo miferable as to be left entirely deftitute of all 
Comfort and Company, as I now was : This forced 
Tears from my Eyes again, but as there was little Re- 
lief in that, I refolv'd, if poflible, to get to the Ship ; 
fo I puird off my Cloaths, for the Weather was hot 
to Extremity, and took the Water ; but when 1 came to 
the Ship, my Difficulty was (Hll greater to know how 
to get on board, for as flie lay a-ground, and high out of 
the Water, there was nothing within my Reach to lay 
hold of-, I fwam round her twice, and the fecond time 
I efpy'd a fmall piece of Rope, which I wonder 'd I did 
notlee atfirft, hang down by the Fore-Chains ib low, 
as with great Difficulty I got hold of it, and by the 
Help of that Rope, got up into the Fore-caftle of the 
Ship. Here I found that the Ship was bulg'd, and 
had a great deal of Water in her Hold, but that fhe lay 
fb on the Side ofaBankof hard Sand, or rather Earth, 
that her Stern lay lifted up upon the Bank, acid herHead 
low almoil to the Water >, by this means all her Quarter 
was free, and all that was in that Part was dry ; for 
you may be fure my Work was to fearch and to fee 
what was fpoil'd, and what was free ; and iirft I found, 
that all the Ship's Provitions were dry, and untouch'd 
by the Water, and being very well difpoled to eat, I 
i went to the Bread-room and fill'd my Pockets with 
; Bisket, and eat it as I went about other things, for I 
\ had no Time to lofe. I alio found lome Rum in the 
\ great Cabin, of which I took a large Dram, and which 
\ 1 had indeed need enough of, to fpirit me for what was 
\ before me. Now I wanted nothing but a Boat to fur- 
I nifh mjielfwith many things which I forefaw wojijd 
[ be very necerlary to me. 

It was in vain to fit ftill and wifh for what was not to 
be had, and this Extremity rcuzM my Application. 
We had feveral fpare Yards, and two or three large 
Spam of Wood, and a fpare Top-Maft or two in the 
Ship; I refolv'd to fall to work with thefe, and flung 
as many of them over-board as I could manage for their 
Weight, tying every one with a Rope that they might 
not drive away ; when this was done, I went down the 
Ship's Side, and pulling them to me, I ty'd four of 
i them

them Faft together at both Ends as well as I could, in 
the Form of a Rait, and laying two or three fhort Pie- 
ces of Flank upon them crofs-Vvays; I found I could 
walk upon k very well, hut that it was not able to btar 
any great Weight, the Pieces being too light ; £o 1 went 
to work, and with the Carpenter's Saw i cut a fpare 
Top mail into three Lengths, and added them to my 
Raft, with a great deal of Labour and Pains ; but the 
Hope of furnilhing my felf with Neceflaries, encou- 
raged me to go beyond what I ihould have been able 
to have done upon another Occafion. 

My Raft was now ftrong enough to bear any reafona- 
bte Weight ; ray next Care was what to load it with, 
and how to preferve what I laid upon it from the Surf 
of the Sea ) but i was not long conlidering this ; I firft 
laid all the Planks or Boards upon it that I could get 9 
and having confider'd well what I molt wantedj 1 
firft got three of the Seamens Chefts, which I had bro- 
ken open and empty'd, and lowerd them down upon 
my Raft ; the firft or thefe I £ ll'd with Provifions, vi%* 
Bread, Rice, three Dutch Cheefes, five Pieces of dry'd 
Goats-Flefn, which we liv'd much upon, and a little 
Remainder of European Corn, which had been laid by 
for fome Fowls which we brought to Sea with us, but 
the Fowls were kill'd ; there had been fome Barley and 
Wheat together, but, to my great Difappointment, I 
found afterwards that the Rats had eaten or fpoiPd it 
all. As for Liquors, I found feveral Cafes of Bottles 
belonging to cur Skipper, in which were fome Cordial 
Waters, and in all about five or fix Gallons of Rack ; 
thefe I ftow'd by themfelves, there being no need to put 
tji^m into the Cheft, nor any room for them. While 
I was doing this, I found the Tide began to flow, tho' 
very calm, and I had the Mortification to fee eny Coat, 
Shirt, and Waftecoat, which I had left on Shore upon 
the Sand, fwim away ; as for my Breeches, which were 
only Linnen and open-kneed, I fwam on board in 
them and my Stockings : However, this put me upon 
rummaging for Cloaths, of which I found enough, 
but took no more than I wanted for prefent life, 
for I had other Things which my Eye was more 
epon \ as firft, Tools to work with on. Shore, and it 

was 



( 47 ) 

Was after long fearching that T found out the Car pen* 

ter's Cheft, which was indeed a very ufeful Prize to 
me, and much more valuable than a Ship-loading of 
<jold w r ould have been at that time^, I got it down 
to my Rart, even whole as it was, without ioling Time 
to look into it, tor 1 knew in general what it contained. 

My next Care was tor fbme Ammunition and Arms ; 
there were two very good Fowling- i ieces in the great 
Cabin, and two Piiiols ; thefe I lecur'd firH, with ibme 
Powder-Horns, and a fmall Bag of Shot, and two old 
ruily Swords: i knew there were three Barrels of Pow- 
der in the Ship, but knew not where our Gunner had 
ftow'd them, but with much Search I found them, two 
of them dry and good, the third had taken Water; 
thofe two 1 got to my Raft, with the Arms.* And now 
I thought my fttt pretty well freighted, and began to 
thirk how I Jhould get to Shore with them, having neir 
ther Sail, Oar, or Rudder, and the leaifc Cap full of 
Wind would have overfet all my Navigation. 

I had three Encouragements. I. A imooth calm Sea. 
i. The Tide riling and letting into the Shore. 3. What 
little Wind there was, blew me towards ths Land ; and 
thus, having found two or three broken Oars belonging 
to the Boat, and befides the Tools which were in the 
Cheft, I found two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and 
with this Cargo I put to Sea : For a Mile or there- 
abouts, my Rait went very well, only that I found it 
drive a little diilant (rem- the Place where I had landed 
before, by which I perceiv'd that there was fome In- 
draught of the W 7 ater, and confequently I hop'd to find 
fome Creek or River there, which I might make uie of 
as a Port to get to Land with my Cargo. 

As I imagined, £0 it was ; there appear'd before me 
a little opening of the Land, and I found a ilrong Cur- 
rent of the Tide let into it j fo I guided my Raft as 
well as I could to keep in the Middle of the Stream : 
But here I had like to have fufFer'd a fecond Ship- 
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have broke 
my Heart -, for knowing nothing or the Coaft, my Raft 
run aground at one End of it upon a Shoal, and not be- 
ing a.ground at the other End, it vvaBted but a little 
*hat all my Cargo had ilipp'd. off towards that End that 

was 



( 48 ) 

Wis a.float, and fo fkllen into the Water : I did my uttf 
moft by fetting my Back againft the Chefts, to keep 
them in their Places, but could not thruft off the Ratt 
with ail my Strength ; neither durft I ftir From the Po- 
fture I was in, but holding up the Chefts with all my 
Might, flood in that manner near half an Hour, in 
which time the rifing of the Water brought me a little 
more upon a Level ; and a little after, the Water ftill 
riling, my Raft floated again, and 1 thruft her off with 
the Oar 1 had, into the Channel, and then driving up 
higher, I at length found my felf in the Mouth of a 
little River, with Land on both Sides, and a ftrong Cur- 
rent or Tide running up. I look'd on both Sides for a 
proper Place to get to Shore, for I was not willing to 
be driven too high up the River, hoping in time to 
fee fome Ship at Sea, and therefore refolv'd to place my 
felf as near the Coaft as 1 could. 

At length I fpy'd a little Cove on the right Shore ot 
the Creek, to which with great Pain and Difficulty I 
guided my Raft, and at latt got fo near, as that, reach- 
ing Ground with my Oar, I could thruft her dire&ly 
in ; but here I had like to have dipt all my Cargo in 
the Sea again ; for that Shore lying pretty fteep, that 
is to fay, doping, there was no Place to land, but 
where one End of the Float, if it run on Shore, would 
lie fo high, and the other fink lower as berore, that it 
would endanger my Cargo again : All that I could 
do, was to wait till the Tide was at the higheft, keep- 
ing the Raft with my Oar, like an Anchor to hold the 
Side of it faft to the Shore, near a flat Piece of Ground, 
which I expe&ed the Water would flow over ; and lo 
it did: As foon as I found Water enough, (for my 
■ r 'Raft drew about a Foot of Water) I thruft her upon 
that flat Piece of Ground, and there faften'd, or 
fuoor'd her, by (ticking my two broken Oars into the 
Ground ; one on one Side near one End, and one on the 
other Side near the other End ; and thus I lay till the 
Water ebb'd away, and left my Raft and all my Cargo 
fafe on Shore. 

My next Work was to view the Country, and feek 

* proper Place for my Habitation, and where to ftow 

my Goods, to fecure them from whatever might hap-

pen. Where I was, I yet knew not; whether on the 

Continent, or on an Ifland; whether inhabited, or not 

^habited; whether in Danger oC Wild Beafts or not: 

-here was a Hill not above a Mile from me, which 

role up very fteep and high, and which feem'd to over-

How 



( Jo ) 

However, as well as I could, I barrlcado'd my felf 
round with the Chefts and Boards that I had brought 
on Shore, and made a kind of a Hutt for that Night's 
Lodging*, as for Food, I yet few not which way to 
fupply my felf, except that I had feen two or three 
Creatures like Hares, run out of the Wood where I fliot 
the Fowl. 

I now began to confider, that f might yet get 
a great many things out of the Ship, which would be 
ufeiul to itie, and particularly fome of the Riggirfg 
and Sails, and fuch other things as might come to hand, 
and I refolv'd to make another Voyage on Board the 
VeiTel, if poflible >and as I knew that the firft Storm 
that blew mull necefFarily break her all in Pieces, I re- 
folv'd to fet all other things apart, till I got every thing 
out of the Ship that I could get ; then l call'd a Coun- 
cil, that is to fay, in my Thoughts, whether I fhould 
take back the Raft, but this appear'd impra&icable ; fd 
I refolv'd to go as before, when the Tide was down, and 
I didfo, only that I ftripp'd before I went from my 
Hutt, having nothing on but a checquer'd Shirt, a 
pair ofLinne'n Drawers, and a pair of #umps on niy 
Feet. 

I got on Board the Ship as before, and prepared a fe- 
cond Raft, and having had Experience of the firft, I 
neither made this fo unweildly, nor loaded it fo hard, 
but yet I brought away feveral things very ufeful to me j 
as firft, in the Carpenter's Stores I found two or three 
Bags full of Nails and Spikes, a great Skrew-Jack, a 
dozen or two of Hatchets, and above all, that mofl ufe- 
fjil thing call*d a Grindftone ; all thefe I fecur'd, toge- 
ther with feveral things belonging to the Gunner, par- 
ticularly two or three! ron Crowes, and two Barrels of 
Mulquet-Bullets, feven Mufquets, and another Fowling- 
Piece, with fome fmall Quantity of Powder more*, a 
large Bag full of fmall Shot, and a great Roll of Sheet 
Lead ; but this laft was lb heavy, I could not hoiffi it up 
to get it over the Ship** fide, 

Befides thefe things, I took all the Men's Cloafhs that 
Icduld find, ancbafpare Fore-tap- fail, Hammock, an4 
ibmc Bedding \ and with this I loaded my fcconi Raft, 

and 



( 5* ) 

and brought them alfo all fafe on Shore to my very 
great Comfort. 

I was under fome Apprehenfions during my Abfence 
from the Land, that at lead my Proviiions might he 
devour'd on Shore *, but when I came. back, i found no 
Sign of any Viator, only there fat a Creature like a 
wild Cat upon one of the Chefts, which when I came 
towards it, ran away to a little Pittance, and then flood 
Hill ; fhe fat very composed, and unconcern'd, and look'd 
full in my Face, as if ihe had a mind co be acquainted 
with me : I prefented my Gun at her, but as fhe did not 
underftand it, fhe was perfe&ly unconcerned at it, nor 
did ihe offer to Hir away ; upon which I toiVd her a bit 
of Bisket, tho ? by the way I was not very free of it, for 
my Store was not great. However, I fpar'd her a hit 
I lay, and fhe went to it, fmell'd of it, and eat it, and 
look'd ( as pleas'd ) for more ; but 1 thank'd her, and 
could fpare no more, fo fhe march'd off. 

Having got my fecond Cargo on Shore, ( tho' I was 
fain to open t he Barrels of Powder, and bring them by 
Parcels, for they were too heavy, being large Casks) I 
went to work to make me a little Tent with the Sail 
and fome Poles which I cut for that Purpofe ; and into 
this Tent L brought every Thing that I knew would 
fpoil, either with Rain, 01 Sun, and I piled all the 
empty Chefts and Casks up in a Circle round the Tent, 
to fortify it from any fudden Attempt, either from 
Man or Beaft. 

When I had done this, I block'd up the Door of the 
Tent with fome Boards within, and an empty Cheft fet 
up an End without, and fpreading one of the Beds up<|© 
the Ground, laying my two Piftols jiul at my Hea d* 
and my Gun at Length by me, I went to bed for the 
firft time, and flept very quietly all Night : I was 
very weary and heavy, for the Night before I had flept 
little, and had labour'd very hard all Day, as well to 
fetch thofe Things from the Ship, as to get them on 
Shore. 

I had the biggeft Magazine of all Kinds now that 

ever were laid up, I believe, for one Man ; but I was 

not fatisfied ftill ; for while the Ship fat upright in t at 

Pofture, I thought I ought to get every thing out of 

D 2 her 



( p ) 

her that I could ; fo every day at low Water I went* on 
board, and brought away fomething or other : But par- 
ticularly the third time I went, I brought away as 
•much of the Rigging as I could, as alio all the fmall 
Ropes and Rope-twine I could get, with a piece of fpare 
Canvas, which was to mend the Sails upon oecafion, 
and the Barrel of wet Gun-powder : In a Word, I 
brought away all the Sails firfl and laft, only that I 
was rain to cut them in Pieces, and bring as much at a 
time as I could ; for they were no more ufeful to me 
for Sails, but as meer Canvas only. 

But that which comforted me more ftill, was, that at 
laft of all, after I had- made five or fix iuch Voyages 
as thefe, and thought I had nothing more to expe& 
from the Ship, that was worth my medling with; I fay, 
after all this, I found, a great Hogfhead of Bread, 
three large Runlets of Rum or Spirits, a Box of fine Su- 
gar, and a Barrel of fine Flower ; this was furprixing 
to me, becaufe I had given over expe&ing any more 
Proviilons, except what was fpoil'd by the Water. I 
foon emptied the Hogfhead of that Bread, and wrapt 
it up, Parcel by Parcel, in Pieces of the Sails, which I 
,cu& put; and in a Word, I got all this fafe on Shore 
aliai tho* at feveral times.* 

The next Day I made another Voyage ; and now 
having plunder 'd the Ship of whafc was portable, and 
fit to hand out, I began with the Cables ; and cutting 
the great Cable into Pieces, fuch as I could move, 1 
got two Cables and a Haulfer on Shore, with all the 
Iron-work I could get; and having cut down the Sprit- 
.^il-yard, and the Mifen-yard, and every thing I could 
Jb make a large Raft, I loaded it \* ith all thole heavy 
Croods, and came away : But my good Luck began now 
to leave me; for this Raft was lb unweildy, and lb over- 
laden, that after \ was enter'd the little Cove, where 
I had lar.dedthe reft of my Goods; not being able to 
guide it (o handily as I did the other, it overlet, and 
threw me and all my Cargo into the Water: As for 
my (elf it was no great Harm, for I was near the Shore ; 
but as to my Cargo, it was great part of it loft, efpe* 
eiaUy the Iron, which I expe&ed would have been of 
great Ufa tomes However, when the Tide was out, i 



( 53 ) 

I got moft of the Pieces of Cable afhore, and fome ol 
the Iron, tho' with infinite Labour, for I was fain to 
dip for it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd me' 
very much ; after this, I went every Day on Board, 
and brought away what I could get. 

I had been now 13 Days on Shore, and had been t t 
times on Board the Ship ; in which time f had brought 
away all, that one pair of Hands could well be fuppos'd 
capable to bring, tho' I believe verily, had the calm 
"Weather held, 1 ihould have brought away the whole? 
Ship, Piece by Piece: But preparing the 12th time to 
go on Board, I found the Wind began to rife ; how- 
ever, at low Water I went on Board, and tho* I thought 
I had rummaged the Cabin fo effe&ually, as that nothing 
more could be found, yet I difcovered a Locker with 
Drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three 
Razors, and one pair of large Sciflars, with ten 
or a dozen good Knives and Forks ; in another I 
found about thirty iix pounds Value in Money, fome 
Eurvpsan Coin, fome Braftl, fome Pieces of Eight, fome 
Gold, fome Hlver. 

I fmil'dto my felfat the fight of this Money. O 
Drugl/a/V? I alcttJy what art thou good for? Thtu 
art net worth to me^ no not the taking offof the Ground; 
one of thofe Knives is worth all this Heap ; I have no 
manner of ufe for thee, e'en remain where thou art, 
and go to the Bottom as a Creature whofe Life is not 
worth faving: However, upon fecond Thoughts, t 
took it away, and wrapping all this in a Piece of Can- 
vas, I began to think of making another Raft; but 
while I was preparing this, I found the Sky over-caft> 
and the Wind began to rife, and in a quarter of an Hcpr 
it blew a frefli Gale from the Shore ; it presently oc* 
cur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a 
Raft, with the Wind off Shore, and that it was my Bu- 
finefs to be gone before the Tide of Flood began, other- 
wife I might not be able to reach the Shore at all : Ac. 
cordingly I let my felf down intothe Water, and fwam 
crofs the Channel, which lay bqtweefe the Ship and the 
Sands, and even that with Difficult^ enough, partly 
with the weight of the things I had about me, and 
parfly the Roughnef§ of the Water, for the Wind role 
D 3 ver/ 



( 54 ) 

Yery hafHly, and before it was quite high Water, ft 
blevy a Storm. 

But I was gotten home to my little Tent* where I 
lay with all my Wealth about me very feeure ; It blew 
very hardball that Night, and in the Morning when I 
kok'd out, behold no more Ship was to be teen. I was 
a little furpriz'd, butrecover'd my felf with this fatis- 
fa&ory Reflexion, vt\. That I had loft no Time, nor 
abated any Diligence to get every thing out of her that 
could be uieful to me, and that indeed there was little 
left in her that I was able to bring away, if I had had. 
jmorc^Time : 1 now gave over any more Thoughts of 
*he Ship, or of any thing out of her, except what might 
drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed divers Pieces 
of her afterwards did \ but thofe things were of fmall 
life to me. 

My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about fe- 
curing myieli- againft either Savages, if any fhould appear 
or wild Beads, if any were in the Ifland \ and I had 
many Thoughts of the Method how to do this, and what 
kind of Dwelling to make; whether J fhould make me 
a Cave in the Earth, or a Tent upon the Earth : And, 
in fhort, 1 refolv'd upon both ; the Manner and Def- 
er iption of which it may »ot be improper to give an 
Account of. ... • 

I ikon found the Place I was in was not for my Set- 
tlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low moot* 
iih Ground near the Sea, and I believed would not be 
wholfome, and more particularly becaufe there was no 
Water near it ; fo I refolv'd to find a more healthy and 
more convenient Spct of Ground. 
^I'.Confulted feveral things rn my Situation, which I 
$>und wculd l>e proper for me ; firft, Health, and frelh 
Water as 1 jud now mention'd ; leoondly, Shelter from 
the Heat oi the Sun ; thirdly, Security from ravenous 
C'reaturcs, whether Man or Beaft ; fourthly, a View 
to the Sea, that if God fent any Ship in Sight, I might 
not lofe any Advantage for my Deliverance, for which 
I was not willing to bantfh my Expe&ation yet. 

In fearch of a Place proper for this, I found a littte 
plain on the. fide of a rifingHill, whoie Form towards 
'this little plain, was as fteep as a Hpuie-iide, 

fo 



(55) 



ft that nothing could come down upon me from tb$ 
Top ; on the fide of this Rock there was a hollow Place 
worn a little way in, like the Entrance or Door of a 
Cave, but there was not really any Cave or Way into 
the Rock at all. 

On the Flat of the Green, jufl before this hollow 
Place, I refolved to pitch my Tent. This Plain was 
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about twice as 
long, and lay like a Green before the Door, and at the 
End of it defcended irregularly every way down into 
the low Grounds by the 5ea~ilde,. It was on the N. N. 
W. fide of the Hill, fo that it was fhelter'd from the 
Heat every Day, till it came to a W. and by 5. Sun, or 
thereabouts, which in thofe Countries is near the feu 
ting. ■ ■ % 

Before I fet up my Tent, I drew a half Circle before 
the hollow Place, which took in about ten Yards in it§ 
Semi-diameter, from the Rock, and twenty Yards in its 
Diameter, from its Beginning and Ending. 

In this half Circle I pitched two Rows of (fcrong 
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they flood 
very firm like Piles, the biggeft End being cut of the, 
Ground about five Foot and a hali^ and iharp'n'd on 
theTop; the two Rows did not ftand above fix Inches 
from one another. 

Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut in the 
Ship,and laid them in Rows upon one another,within the 
Circle between thefe two Rows of Stakes, uj> to theTop, 
placing other Stakes in the infide, leaning againfb theny 
about two Foot and a half high, like a Spur to a Poll,* 
and this Fence was fo flrong, that neither Man or Beaft 
could get into it or over it. This coil me a great deal 
of Time and Labour, especially to cut the Piles in tilts 
Woods, bring them to the Place, and drive them into 
the Earth. 

The Entrance into this Place I made to be, not by a 
Door, but by a fliort Ladder, to go over the Top, 
which Ladder, when I was in, I lilted over after me, 
and (§1 was compleatly fenced in, and fortified, as I 
thati^jtit, from all the World, and Qonfequently flepc 
ftcurejh the Night, which otherwife I could not have 
done^tho' asitappear'd afterward, there was no need of 
* D4 all 



all this Caution from the Enemies I apprehended Dan- 
ger from. 

Into this Fence, or Fortrefs, with infinite Labour, 
I carry*d all my Riches, all my Proviflons, Ammunition 
and Mores, ot which you have the Account above ; and 
1 made me a large Tent alio, to preferve me frotn- 
the Rains, that in one Part of the Year are very violent 
there, I made double, vi\. one fmailer Tent within, 
and one larger Tent above it, and cover'd the upper- 
moil part of it with a large Tarpaulin which I had 
iav'd among the Sails. 

And now i lay no more for a while in the Bed* which 
I had brought on Shore, but in a Hammock, which was 
indeed a very goud one, andbelong'd to the Mate of the 
Ship. - .. 

into this Tent I brought all my Provisions, and every 
Thing that would fpoil by the Wet 5 and having thus 
enclosed all my Goods, 1 made up the Entrance, which 
till now I had left open, and io pafs'd and repafs'd, as 
I faid, by a fhort Ladder. 

When I had done this, I began to work my Way in- 
to the Rock, and bringing all the Earth and Stones that 
I dug down, out thro' my Tent, I laid them up within 
my Fence in tire Nature of a Terrace, fb^that it rais'd 
the Ground within about a Foot and a Half; and thus 
I made a Cave juft behind my Tent> which ferv*d me 
like a Cellar to my Houfe. 

Itcofr me much Labour, and many Days, before all 
thefc Things were brought to Pcrfe&ion, and therefore 
I!muft go back to fome other Things which took up 
fome of my Thoughts. At the fame Time it happen'd 
afepr I had laid my Scheme for the letting up my Tent, 
and making the Cave, that a Storm of Rain falling from 
a thick dark Cloud, a fudden Flafti of Lightning hap- 
pened, and after that, a great Clap of Thunder, as is 
naturally the Ef&& of it : I was not Co much furprii'd 
with the Lightning, as I was with a Thought which 
darted into my Mir/d as fwift as the Lightning it felf : 
O my Powder ! my very Heart funk within me, when 
I" thought, that atone Blaft all my Powder might be 
diefilroy'd j on which, not my Defence only, but the 



t 57 5 



providing me Food, as I thought, entirely depended % 
I was nothing near fo anxious about my own Danger, 
tho' had the Powder took Fire, I had never known who 
had hurt me. 

Such Impreffion did this make upon me, that after 
the Storm was over, I laid afide all my Works, my 
Building and Fortifying, and apply'd my felf to make 
Bags and Boxes to ieparate the Powder, and to keep 
it a little and a little in a Parcel, in hope, that whate- 
ver might come, it might not all take Fire at once, and 
to keep it fo apart, that it fliould not be pollible to make 
one part fire another. I iinifhed this Work in about a 
Fortnight, and I think my Powder, which in all was 
about 140 Ib.Wt. was divided inno lefs than a hundred 
Parcels. As to the Barrel that had been wet, 1 did not 
apprehend any Danger from that, fo I plac'd it in my 
new Cave, which in my Fancy I calFd my Ritchin ; 
and the reft I hid up and down in Holes among the 
Rocks, fo that no Wet might come to it, marking very 
carefully where I laid it. 

In the interval of Time while this was doing, I went 
out at lead once every Day with my Gun, as well to di- 
vert my felf, as to fee if I could kill any thing fit for 
Food, and as near as I could, to acquaint my felf with 
what the Ifland produc'd. The firft Time I went out, 
I prefently difcover'd that there were Goats in the I- 
fland, which was a great Satisfa&ion tome ; but then it 
was attended with this Misfortune to me, vi%. That 
they were fo lhy, fo fubtle, and fo fwift of Foot, that 
it was the difficulteft Thing in the World to come at 
them : But I was not difcourag'd at this, not doubting, 
but I might now and then fhoot one, as it foon happen^ ; 
for after I had found their Haunts a little, I laid wait 
in this Manner for them; I obferved, if they law; 
me, in th£ Valleys, tho' they were upon the Rocks > 
they would run aw r ay as in a terrible Frfglit; but 
if they Mete feeding in the Valleys, and I was up- 
on the Rocks, they took no Notice of me ; from whence 
J concluded, that by the Pofttion of their Opticks, their 
Sighfi.wasfo dire&ed downward, that they did not rear 
dily fee Obje&s that were above them : So afterwards I 
D S took 



( ?o 

took tliis Method, 1 always climh'd the Rocks firfl, ti 
ge above them, and then had frequently a fair Mark. 
Uhe £r(k Shot I made among thefe Creatures, I kill'd 
a She-Goat which had a little Kid by her, which flie 
gave Suck to, which grieved me heartily ; but when the 
Old one fell, the Kid flood ftock ftill by her till I came 
and took her up; and not only lb, but when I carried 
the Old one with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid fol- 
lowed me quite to my EnclolJUre ; upon which I laid 
down the Dam^and took the Kid in my Arms, and car- 
ried it over my Pale, in Hopes to have bred it up tame, 
but it would not eat, fo I was fore'd to kill it and eat 
it myfelf; theie two mpply'd me with Fleih a great 
while, for I eat fparingly ; and fav'd my Provifions (my 
Bread efpecially) as much as poflibly I could. 

Having now fix'd my Habitation, I found it abfolute- 
ly necefTary to provide a Place to make a Fire in, and 
Fuel to burn ; and what I did for that, as alfo how I 
enkrg'd my Cave, and what Conveniencies I made, I 
fhall give a full Account of in its Place : But I mud firft 
give ibme little Account of my felf* and of my Thoughts 
about Living, which it may well be fuppos'd were not 
a few. 

I had a difmal Profpe& of my Condition ; for as I 
■vyas not cafl away upon that I (land without being dri- 
tcn, as is laid, by a violent Storm quite out of the Courfe 
efeur intended Voyage, and a great Way, vi%. ibme Hun- 
dreds of Leagues out of the ordinary Courfe of the Trade 
of Mankind, I had great Reafon to conflder it as a De- 
termination of Heaven, that in this deiblate Place, and 
in this defolate Manner Iihould end my Life : the Tears 
wftuld run plentifully down my Face when f made thefe 
Reflexions, and fometimes I would expoftulate with 
my felf, WhyProvidenee fhould thus compleatly ruin its 
Creatures, and render them fo abfolutely miferable, fo 
without Help, abandoned, and fo entirely deprefe'd that 
it could hardly be rational to be thankful for fuch a 
Life? 

But fomething always returned fwift upon me to cbeck 
thefe Thoughts, and to reprove me ; and particularly 
one Day walking with my Gun in my Hand by the Sea* 
*de, I was very pen/ive upon the Subjeft of my prefent 

Con- 



O'O 



Condition, when Reafon, as it were put in, expostulating 
with me to'ther Way, thus : Well, you are in a delblate 
Condition 'tis^true ; but pray rememher, where are the 
reft of you? Did not you come Eleven of you into the 
Boat, where are the Ten ? Why were not thty fav'd, and 
youloft ? . W hy are you fingled out ? Is it better to be here 
or there ? and then I pointed to the Sea. All Evils 
are be confider'd with the Good that is in them, and 
with what worfe attended them. 

Then it occured to me again, how well I was fur- 
nifh'd tor my Subfiftance, and what would have b^n 
my Cafe, if it had not happen'd, Wh'nb was an Hundred 
Tb ufa&d to One, that the Ship floated from the Place 
were firft fhe (truck, and was driven fo near to the 
Share that I had time to get ail thefe things out of her ? 
What would have been my Cafe, if I had been to have 
My'd in the Condition in which I at rirft: came on Shore, 
without ^ecefiaries of Life, or Neceffaries to fupply 
and procure them ? Particularly faid I aloud, (tho 5 to 
my lelf) .what would I ha' done without a Gun, with* 
out Ammunition, without any Tools to make any thing* 
or to work with ? Without Cloaths, Bedding,, a Tent, 
or any manner of Coverings ? And that now I bad all 
thefe to a fufficient Quantity, and was in a rair way to 
provide my felf in fuch a manner, as to live without my 
Gun when, my Ammunition was fpent, fo that I baa 
a tolerable View of fuhfifting without any Want as Iqng 
as I liv'd ; for I confider'd from the Beginning bow I 
>voul<Jprovi4e for the Accidents that might happen, and 
for tije Time that was %o come, even not only .after my 
Ammunition fhould be (pent, but ev^n after my HealtU 
or Strength fhould decay. 

I cqnfefs I had not then entertain'd any Notion ofmy 
Ammunition being deftroyM' at one Biail, I mean my 
powder being Iplown up by Lightning, and this made the 
Thoughts of it lb furprizing to me when it lighten'dand 
fbunder'd, as I obfery*d jitll now. 

And now, being to enter into a tmelancholy Relation 
of a Soene of filent Life, fuch perhaps as was never 
heard of in the World before, I fhall take it from its Be- 
ginning, and continue it in its Older. It was by my 
Account, the, 30th ..of September ^ when>in.the manper 

as 



as ahovefaid, I' firft'fet Foot upon tins horrid Ifland* 
when the- Sun being, to us, in its Autumnal Equinox, 
was almoft juft over my Head, for I reckon'd my felf; 
by Obfervation, to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees, 22 
Minutes North of the Line, 

After 1 had been there about Ten or Twelve Days, 
it came intdiny Thoughts, that I fhould lole my Rec- 
koning o^Time for want of Books, and Pen and Ink, 
and ihould even forget the Sabbath Days from the woH 
king Days : But to prevent this, I cut it with my Knife 
upon a large Pod, in Capital Letters, arid making i# 
into a great Crofs, I fet it up on the Shore where I hril: 
landed, vi{, I cams on Sb:re here the "$otk a/Sept* 1659. 
Upon the Sides of this fquare Poft, I cut every Day a 
Notch with my Knife, and every feventh Notch was 
as long again as the reft, and every firft Day of the 
>lonth as long again as that long one; and thus I kept 
my Kalendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly Reckon- 
ing of Time. 

in the next place we are to obferve, that among the 
many things which I brought off the Ship in the fede- 
ral Voyages, which, as abovemention'dj I made to it, £ 
got feveral things of leis value, but not at all lefs u(e~ 
tul to me, which I omitted letting down before ; as in 
particular, Pens, Ink, and Paper, leveral Parcels in the 
Captain's, Mate's, Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, 
three or four Companies, ibme Mathematical Inftru- 
ments, . Dials, Perfpe&ives, Charts, and Books of Na- 
vigation, all which I huddled together, whether I might 
-want them or no ; alfo I found three very good Bibles, 
which came to me in my Cargo from England^ and 
which I had pack'd up among my things ; fome fortw 
gue& Books alfo, and among them two or three Popifh 
Prayer-Books, and leveral other Books, all which I care- 
fully fecur'd. And I muft not forget that we had in 
the Ship a Dog and two Cats, of whofe eminent Hifto- 
ry I may have occafion to fay fomethtng in its Place; 
lor I carried both the Cats with me*, and as for the 
Dog, he jump'd out of the Ship of htmlel£ and fwam 
on Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore with my 
firft Cargo, and was a trufty Servant to me many 
Years: I wanted nothing that he could feich me, nor 

an/ 



'( 61 > 

any Company that he could make up to me; I only 
wanted to have him talk to me, hut that would nor 
do. As I ohlerv'd before, I found Pen, Ink and Paper, 
and I husbanded them to the utmofl * f and I ffiall fhew, 
that while my Ink lailed, I kept things very exa& ; but 
after that was gone, I, could not •, for 1 could not make 
any Ink, by any Means that I could devile. 

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, 
notwithstanding all that I had amafs'd together ; and of 
thele, this of Ink was one, as alfo a Spade, Pick-Axe and 
Shovel, to dig or remove the Earth •, Needles, Pins and 
Thread ; as for Linnen I foon learn'd to want that with* 
out much Difficulty. 

This Want of Tools made every Work I did goon 
heavily, and it was near a whole Year before I had en- 
tirely finifhed my little Pale, or furrounded Habita- 
tion : The Piles, or Stakes, which were as heavy as I 
could well lift, were a long time in cutting and pre- 
paring in the Wcods, and more by far in bringing 
home 5- fo that I fpent fometimes two Days in Cutting 
and bringing home one of- thole Polls, and a third Day 
in -driving it into the Ground ; for which purpofe f 
got a heavy Piece of Wood at firffc, but at lail bethought 
my felf of one of the Iron Crows, which however*, tho* 
I found it, yet it made driving thofe Polls or Piles very 
laborious and tedious Work. 

But what need 1 ha* been concerned at theTediouf- 
nefs of any thing I had to ^o y feeing I had time enough 
to do it in ; nor had I any other Employment if that 
had been over, at lead, that I could forelee, except the 
ranging the lflarid to feek for Food, which 1 did more 
orlefs every Day. % 

I now began to confider ferioufly my Cond ition, and 
the Circumllance I was reduc'd to ; and I drew up the 
State of my Affairs in Writing; not lb much to leave 
them to any that were to come after me, for I was like 
t© have but few Heirs, as to deliver my Thoughts from 
daily poring upon them, and afftidling my Mini ; and 
as my Reifon began now to matter my Difpondency, 
I began to comfort my felf as well a? I could, and ih 
fet the Good againft the Evil, that I might have fome- 
thing to diftinguifli my Cafe from worfe $ and. I fiated 



k very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, tt»e Com* 
forts I enjoy'd, againft the Miieries I fuffer'd, thus: 



EVIL. 

/ am cafl upon a horrible 
defohtte tfland, void of fill 
Hope of Recovery. 

1 am fmgled cut and fe* 
parated, as it were, frcm 
all the WM to be msfera-

I am divided from Man- 
kind, a Solitairy, me ha- 
wjlfdfrom human Society. 



GOOD. 
But I am alive , and no% 
dy&vo.rfd y as all my Ships 
Company was. 

But I am fmgled out tot 
from allibe Ship's Crew to 
be fpared from Death ; and 
he that miracukufly javed 
me from Death, can deliver 
me from this Condition. 

But I am not flarv*d and 
perljhing on a barren Vlace% 
affording no Sufienance. 



I have wClotithsto tover But 1 am in a hotCli* 
«tf* mate&here if 1 had deaths* 

1 could hardly wear them. 

I am without any De- But 1 am cafl on an JJland

Violence of Man or Beafl. to hurt me, as Ifaw on -t\he 

Caafiof Africa: J^d^wjbat 
if I had hem Shipwr&ttd 
there? 



I have no Swl to fpeakio^ 
0/ relieve me* 



But God wonderfully fent 
theSbip in near enough to lbs 
Shore, that I have gtiten cut 
fo many necejfary things as 
will either fupply mj Want x, 
or enable ,me to fuppHy wyr 
felf, even as long 4s Alive*: 

Upon the whole, here avas an undoubted Teftimo* 
my, that there was fcarce any Condition in the .World 
(6 miferabtej but there was fometbing negative or fonie* 
jtbing pcffihie ito, bethankful for in it.; and .let, this &md 

-y* J as 



.( «3 ) • 

as a Dire&ton from the Experience of the moftmiferable 
©fall Conditions in this World, that we may always 
find in it fomething to comfort ourielvcs from, and to 
fet in the Defcription of Good and Evil, on the Credit 
iide of the Account. 

Haying now brought my Mind a little to relifh my 
Condition, and given over looking out to Sea, to fee if 
I could fpy a Ship ; I fay, giving over thefe Things, I 
began to apply myfelf to accommodate my way of Liv- 
ing, and to make things as eafy to me as I could. 

I have already defcribed my Habitation, which was 
a Tent under the fide of a Rock, furrounded with a 
ftrong Pale of Pofis and Cables, but I might now ra- 
ther call it a Wall •, for I raifed a kind of Wall up againft 
it of Turfs, about two Foot thick on the Qutfide > and 
after fome time, (I think it was a Year and half) I 
raifed Rafters from it, leaning to the Rock, and -thatch'd 
or covered it with Boughs of Trees, and fuch things as 
I could get, to keep out the Rain, which I found at 
fome times of the Year very violent. 

I have already obferv'd how I brought all my 
Goods into this Pale, and into the Cave which I had 
made behind me : But I mull obferve too, that at firfl 
this was a confufed Heap of Goods, which as they lay 
in no Order, fo they took up all my Place, I had no 
room to turn myielf; fo I fet myfelf to enlarge niy Cave, 
and work'd farther into the Earth \ for it was a loofe 
fandy Rock, which yielded eaflly to the Labour I be* 
flowed on it : And fo when I found I was pretty fafe 
as to Beads of Prey, I work'd Tideways to the Right 
Hand into the Rock ; and then turning to the Right a- 
gain, work'd quite out, and made me Door to come 
out on the Outiide of my Pale or Fortification. 

This gay e -me not dnly Egrefs and Regrefs, as it were 
a Back-Way to my Tent, and to my Store-houfe, but 
gave me-room to flow my Goods. 

And now I began to apply myfelf to make fuch ne* 
Ceffary things as I found I mod wanted, particularly a 
Chair and a Table ; for without thefe I was not able to 
enjoy the few Comforts I had in the World ; I could 
not write or eat, or feveral things, with ib much Plea- 
fure wi$hvut*a Tabic. 

So 



( *4 ) 



1 So I went to work : and here I muft needs obferve^ 
that as Reafon is the Subftance and Original of the Ma- 
thematicks, fo by dating and iquaring every thing by 
Reafon, and by making the molt rational Judgment of 
things, every Man may be in time, Mailer of every Me* 
chanick Art. I had never handled a Tool in my Life, 
and yet in time, by Labour, Application and Contriv- 
ance, I found at laft that I wanted nothing but I cculd 
have made it, efpecially if I had had Tools ; however, 
I made abundance of things even without Tools, and 
fo me with no more Tools than an Adz and a Hatchet, 
which perhaps were never made that way before, and 
that with infinite Labour. For Example, If I wanted 
a Board, I had no other way but to cut down a Tree, 
fet it on an edge before me, and hew it flat on either 
Side with my Axe, till I had brought it to be as thin 
as a Plank, and then dubb it fmooth with my Adz : 
It is true, by this Method I could make but one Board 
out of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy for but 
Patience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal 
of Time and Labour which it took me up to make a 
Plank or Board : But my Time or Labour was little 
worth, and fo-it was as well employ'd one way as a. 
nother. 

< However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as I ob- 
jerv'd above, in the firft Place, and this I did out of 
the ihort Pieces of Boards that I brought on my Raft 
from the Ship : But when i had wrought out fome 
Boards, as above, I made large Shelves or' the breadth 
of a Foot and a half, one over another, ail along one 
fide of my Cave, to lay all my Tools, Nails and Iron- 
work, and in a Word, to feparate every thing at large 
in their Places, that 1 might eafiiy come at them ; alio 
i knock'd Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my 
Guns, and all things that would, hang up* 

So that had my Cave been to be feen, it look*d like a 
general Magazine of all neceffary things > and I had 
every thing lb ready at my Hand, that it was a great 
Flealureto me to fee all my Goods in'fuc-h- Order, and 
efpecially to find my Stock of all Neceflaries fo great. 

And now it was when I began to keep a Journal oC 
every Day's Employment, for indeed at fir.ft I was w 
c coo 



( 6y ) 

too much Hurry, and not only a Hurry as to Labour, 
but in too much Difcompofure of Mind, and my Jour- 
nal would ha J been full of many dull things. For Ex- 
ample, I muft have faid thus: Seft* the 30th. After I 
got to Shore, and had efcap'd drowning, inftead of be- 
ing thankful to God for my Deliverance, having firft 
vomited, with the great Quantity of fait Water which 
was gotten into my Stomach, and recovering myfelfa 
little, I ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands and 
beating my Head and Face, exclaiming at my Mifery, 
and crying cut, I was undone, undone, till tir'd and faint, 
J was forc'd to lye down on the Ground to Repofe, but 
dur ft not deep, for fear of being devoured. 

Some Days after this and after I had been on board 
the Ship, and had got all I could out of her, yet 1 could 
not forbear getting up to the Top of a little Mountain, 
and looking out to Sea, in hopes of feeing a Ship, then 
fancy at a vaft Diftance I fpy'd a Sail, pleafe my felf 
with the Hopes of it, and then after looking fteadily till 
I wasalmoft Hind, lole it quite, and fit down and weep 
like a Child, and thus encreafe my Mifery by my Folly. 

But having gotten over thefe thingt in fome mea* 
fure, and having fettled my Houfhold Stuff and Ha. 
bitatton, made me ^ Table and a Chair, and all as 
bandfome about me as I could, I began, ifay> to keep my 
Journal^ of which I ihall here give you the Copy, 
( tho* in it will be told all thefe Particulars over again) 
as long as it lifted ; for at laft having no more lnk f 
I was forced to leave it off. 

The Journal. 

Eptember 36, 16^9. I, poor miferable R0. 
binfcn Crujoe, being fhipwreck'd, during a 
dreadful Storm n in the Ojfing> came on Shore 
on this difmal unfortunate lfland, which I 
calPd the lfland of Dtfpair^ all the reft of 
the Ship's Company Iseing drown'd, and my felf al- 
moft dead. 

AU 




All the reft of the Day I fpent in aiflufting my felf at 
the difrnal Circumftances I was brought to, vi^ I had 
neither Food, Houfe, Cloaths, Weapon, or Place to 
fly to, and in Defpair of any Relief, law nothing but 
Death before me, either that I ihould be devour'd by 
wild Beafts, murder'd by Savages, or ftarv'd to Death 
for want of Food. At the Approach of Night, I flept 
in a Tree for fear of wild Creatures, but flept found- 
ly, tho' it rain'd all Night. 

Ottcber i. In the Morning I faw, to my great Sur- 
prize, the Ship had floated with the high Tide, and 
was driven on Shore again much nearer the Ifland, 
which, as it was fome Comfort on one hand (for fee- 
ing her fit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, 
if the Wind abated, I might get on board, and get fome. 
Food and NeceiTaries out of her for my Relief ) fo on 
the other hand, itrenew'd my Grief at the Lofs of my 
Comrades, who, I imagined, if we had all (laid on 
board, might have faved the Ship, or at lead that they 
would not have been all drowned, as they were ; and 
that had the Men been laved, we might perhaps have 
built us a Boat out of the Ruins of the Ship, to have 
carried us to fome other Part of the World. I fpe**t 
great Part of this Day in perplexing my felf on thefe 
things*, but at length feeing the , Ship almoft "dry, I 
went upon the Sand as near as I could, and then fwam 
on board : This Day alfo continued raining, tho' with 
no Wind at all. 

From the ift ofQdober to the 24th. All thefe Days 
entirely l'pent in many feveral Voyages to get all I could 
out of the Ship, which I brought on Shore every Tide 
of Flood upon Rafts. Much Rain alfo in thefe Days, 
tho' with Come Intervals of fair Weather : But, it feems, 
this was the rainy Seafon* 

Q&. 2C. I overfet my Raft, and all the Goods I had 
got upon it ; but being in fhoal Water, and the things 
being chiefly heavy, I recover'd many of them when 
the Tide was out. 

Ofo 2$. It rained all Night ,and all Day, with fome 
Gufts of Wind, during which Time the Ship broke in 
Pieces, the Wiud blowing a little harder than before,, 
and was no more to be feen, except the Wreck of her, 

and 



>w- 



C *7 ) 

and that only at lew Water. I {pent this Day in co* 
vering and fecuring the Goods which I had faved, thai; 
the Rain might not fpoil them. 

Oct. 26. I walk'd about the Shore almoft all Day tm 
find out a Place to fix my Habitation, greatly concern 9 d 
to fecure my felf from any AttacK in the Night, either 
from wild Beads or Men. Towards Night i fix'd upon 
a proper Place undef a Hock, and mark'd out a Semi- 
Circle for my Encampment, which I refolv'd to 
ftrengthen with a Work, Wall, or Fortification, made 
of double Piles, lined within with Cable, and without 
with Turf. -* *"■ 

From the 26th to the 30th, I work'd very hard in 
carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation, though 
ibn.ie Part of the Time it rain'd exceeding hard. 

The 31ft in the Morning I went out into the Ifland 
with my Gun to feeJVor fame Food, and diibover the 
Country, when^l ktfl'd a She-Goat, and her Kid fol- 
lowed me Home/ which I afterwards kilFd alfo, becaufe 
it would not feed. 

November i . I fet up my Tent under a Rock, and lay 
jthere for the firft Night, -making it as large as I could 
with Stakes driven in to fwing my Hammock upon. 

Nw, ,2. I fet up all my Chefts and Boards, aj>d the 
Pieces of Timber wind* made my Rafts, a^d with them 
form'd a Fence round me, a little within the Place I 
had mark'd out for my Fortification. 

Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun, and kilFd two 
Fowls like Ducks, which were very good Food. In the 
Afternoon went to work to make me a Table. 

Nov. 4. This Morning I began to order my Times 
of Work, of going but with my Gun, Time of Sleep, 
and Time of Diverfion, vi\. Every Morning I walk'd 
cut with my Gun for two or three Hours, if it did not 
rain, then employed my felf to work Hll about eleven 
a Clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from 
twelve to two I lay down to fleep, the Weather being 
exceflive hot, and then in the Evening to work .again : 
The working Part of this Day and the next were whol- 
ly employed in making my Table, for. J was yet but a 
very ibrry Workman, tho' Time and Neceifity made 

m 



OS r< 



me a compleat natural Mechanick Toon after, as I believe 
it would do any one elfe. 

Nov. <f. This Day I went abrqj4 with my Gun and 
my Dog, and kilPd a wild Cat, her Skin pretty foft, 
but her FleiL good for nothing: Every Creature, I kilPd, 
I took off the Skins and" preierv'd them. Coming 
bapk by the Sea Shore, I law many Sorts of Sea-Fowls 
which i did not underftand ; but was furprized, and al- 
moft frighted with two or three* Seals, which, while 

I was gazing at, no^yell knowingjvhat they were, got 
into the Sea, and efci|iii%ie forfpLt time. 

Njv. 6. After my Morning wfllP I went to Work 
with my Table again, and feniiheSfc^ ^ho' not to my 
Liking ; nor was it long before ^*^%y§to mend it. 

Nov. 7. Now it began to be^HJMalpir Weather, 
The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and P «M ffl#%ath (for the 

I I th was Sunday, according to nHfttiEigfcfog) I took 
wholly up to make me a Chair, ^fa^w^nuch ado 
brought it to a tolerable Shape, but never tofjheafe me ; 
and even in the Making I pull'd it to Pieces feveral 
times. Note 9 I foon negle&ed my keeping Sunday ; for 
omitting my Mark for them on my Poft 5 1 forgot which 
was which. 

NHv.13. This Day it rained, which refrefhed me 
exceedingly, and cooled the Earth, but it was accompa- 
ny*d with terrible Thunder and Lightning, which fright- 
ed me dreadfully, for fear of my Powder : As foon as 
it was over, I refolved to feparate my Stock of Powder 
into as many little Parcels as poffible, that it might not 
be in Danger. 

Nov. 14, i$, 16. Thefe three Days I fpentin making 
Jit tie ftjuare C hefts or Boxes, which might hold about 
A Pound, or two Pound, at moft, of Powder \ and fo 
putting the Powder in, I flowed it in Places as fecure 
and remote from one another as pofftble. On one of 
thefe three Days I kilVd a large Bird that was good to 
eat, but I knew not what to call it. 
^ Nov. 17. This Day I began to dig behind my Tent 
into the Rock, to make room for my farther Conveni- 
ency. AW, Three Things I wanted exceedingly for 
this Work, vt%. a Pick-axe, a Shovel, and a Wheel- 
barrow ox Basket, fo I defifted from my Work, and be- 
gan 



CO 



gati to confider how to fupply that Want, and make me 
ibme Tools. As for a Pick-axe, I made ule of the I- 
ron Crows, which were proper enough, tho' heavy; 
but the next Thing was a Shovel or Spade ; this was fa 
abiblutely neceflary, that indeed I could do nothing ef- 
fectually without it j but what kind of one to make I 
knew not. 

Ncv. 18. The next Day in fearching the Woods, I 
found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which in the Bra- 
(ih they call the Iron Tree> for its exceeding Hardneis > 
of this, with great Labour, and almoft fpoiling my A* y 
I cut a Piece, and brought it Home too with Difficul- 
ty enough, for it was exceeding heavy. 

The exceffive Hardnefs of the Wood, and having no 
other Way, made me a long while upon this Machine, 
for I work'd it effectually, by little and little, into the 
Form of a Shovel or Spade, the Handle exactly fhap'd 
like ours in England^ only that the broad Part having 
no Iron fhod upon it at Bottom, it would not laft me 
fo long ; however it ferv'd well enough for the UTes 
which i had Occafion to put it to ; but never was a 
Shovel,. I believe, made alter that Faihion, or fo long 
a making. 

I was Hill deficient, for T wanted a Basket or a Wheel-* 
barrow \ a Basket I could not make by any means, ha- 
ving no fuch Things as Twigs that would bend to make 
Wicker Ware, atleaft none yet found out ; and as to 
the Wheel-barrow, I fancy'd I could make all but the 
Wheel, but that I had no Notion of, neither did I 
know how to go about it ; befides, 1 had no po&ble 
Way to make Iron Gudgeons for, the Spindle or Axis of 
the Wheel to run in, fo I gave it over; and fo for carrying 
away the Earth which I dug out of the Cave, I made 
me a thing like a Hoad which the Labourers carry Mor- 
tar in when they ferve the Bricklayers. , 

This was not fo difficult to me as the making the 
Shovel ; and yet this, and the Shovel, and the Attempt, 
which I made in vain, to make a Wheel -barrow, took 
,me up no lefs than four Days \ I mean always, except* 
ing my Mornings Walk with my GunV which I feldom 
fatPd, and very feldom fail'd alio of bringing home 
fcmething fit to eat*

Ifrfyv. 23. My <^Her Work having flow flood ft ill, be- 
catife of my making thefe Tools 5 when they were finifh- 
ed, 1 went on ; and working every Day, as my Strength 
and Time allow'd, I fpent eighteen Days entirely in 
widening and deepening my Cave, that it might hold 
my Goods eoaimodioiifly. 

Ncte > During all this Time, I work'd to make this 
Room or Cave ipaciotts enough to accommodate me as a 
Ware-houfe or Magazine, a Kitchen, a Dining-room, 
a*nd a Cellar • as for a Lodging, I kept to the Tent, ex- 
cept that lbmetimes in the wet Seafbn of the Year, it 
rain'd fo hard that I could not keep my ielf dry, which 
caus'd me afterwards to cover all mf Place within my 
Pale with long Poles in the form of Rafters, leaning a- 
gainft the Rock, and load them with Blags, and large 
Leaves of Trees like a Thatch. 

December 10. I began nowto think my Cave or Vault 
finijhed, when on a iuddain (it ieems I had made it too 
large) a great Quantify of Earth fell down from the 
Top and one Side, {o much, that in fhort it frighted me, 
stnd not without Realbn too, for if! had been unde*r it, 
I had never wanted a Grave-digger : Upon this Dilafter 
I had a great deal of Work to do over again ; for I had 
the loofe Earth to carry out, and, which was of more 
Importance, I had the Cieling to prop up, fo that I 
might be fure no more would come down. 

Dec. 11. This Day I went to work with it accord- 
ingly, and got two Shoars, or Pofb pitch'd upright to 
the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-cro{s over each 
Poft : This I finifh'd the next Day ; and fetting more 
Ports up with Boards, in about a Week more I had the 
Rooffecured; and the Pcfh {landing in Rows, ferved 
ine for Partitions to part off my Houie. 

Dec 17. From this Day to the 20th,'I placed Shelves, 
and knock'd up Nails on the Pofts to hang every thing 
tip that could be hung up 3 and now I began to be in 
foine Order within Doors. 

Dec 20. Now I carried every thing into the Cave, 
and began toTurniih my Houfe, and fet up {om& Piteees 
of Boards like a DrefTer, to order my Visuals upon ; 
but Boards began to be very fcarce with me : Alfo I 
made me another Table. 

Dec. H* 



( 7i ) 



Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day ; no ftir* 
ring out. 

Dec. 2$. Rain all. Day. 

Dec, 26. No Rain, and the Earth much cooler than 
before, and pleafanter. 

Dec. 27. Kil?d a young Goat, and lam'd ariother, 
Co that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a String ; when 
I had it Home, I bound and fplinter'd up its Leg which 
was broke. 2V". B. I took fuch care of it that it lived, 
and the Leg grew well, and as ftrong as ever ; but by 
nurfing it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the little 
Green at my Door, and would not go away. This 
was the flrft time that I entertained a Thought of breed- 
ing up fome tame Creatures, that I might have Food 
when my Powder and Shot was all lpent. 

Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; Co that 
there was no ftirring abroad, except in the Evening for 
Food : This Time i fpent in putting all my Things in 
Order within Doors. 

January 1 . Very hot ftill , but I went abroad early 
and late with my Gun, and lay ftill in the middle of 
the Day : This" Evening going farther into the Valleys, 
which lay towards the Center of the Ifland, I found 
there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding fhie arid hard 
to come at \ however, I refolv'd to try if I could not 
bring my Dog to hunt them down. 

Jan. 2. Accordingly, the next Day I went out with 
my Dog, and fet him upon the Goats ; but I was mifta- 
ken, for they all faced about upon the Dog, and he 
knew his Danger t©o well, for he would riot come near 
them. 
*Jan* 3. I began my Fence or Wall, which, being ftill 
jealous of my being attack'd by foriie Body, I refolv'd to 
to make very thick and ftrong, 

N* B. This Wall being described before, 1 purpofety 
omit what was f did in the Journal : it is fit Jt dent 
to obfefve, that 1 was no lejs Time than from the 
%dof January to the x^thof April* wotting, finish- 
ing and perfecting this Wall, tho it was no % mere 
than about 24. Tards in length, being a half Circle 
from om Phce m the Rock to another Place about 

eight 



(7*) 



eight Jardsfrotn it $ the Doer of the Cave being in 
tM Center behind iU 

All this. time I worked very hard, the Rains hinder- 
ing me many Days, nay, fometimes Weeks together ; 
but I thought I ihould never be perfe&ly fecure till this 
"Wall was hnifh'd ; and it is fcarce credible what ineju 
prellible Labour every thing was done with, efpecially 
the bringing Piles out of the Woods, and driving them 
into the Ground \ for I made them much bigger than I 
needed to have done. 

When this Wall was £nifh'd, and the Outflde double 
fenced, with a Turf-Wall railed up clofe to it, I per* 
fwaded myielfi that if any People were come on fhore 
there, they would not perceive any thing like a Habi- 
tation : And it was very well I did (o f as may be ob- 
ferv'd hereafter, upon a very remarkable Occaflon. 

During this time, I made my Rounds in the Woods 
for Game every Day when the Rain admitted me, and 
made frequent Difcoveries in thefe Walks of fomething 
or other to rny Advantage ; particularly I found a kind i 
of wild Pidgeons, who built not as Wood-Pidgeons in 
k Tree, but rather as Houfe-Pidgeons, in the Holes of* 
the Rocks ; and. taking fome young ones, I endeavoured i 
to breed them up tame, and did fo \ but when they 
grew older, they flew all away 5 which perhaps was at 
iirft want of feeding them, for I had nothing to give 
them ; however I frequently found their Neils, and got 
their young ones, which were very good Meat. 

And now in the managing my Hdufhold Affairs, I 
found my felf wanting in many things, which I thought 
at £rft it was impoffible for me to make, as indeed as ' 
to fome of them it was : For in/lance y I could never 
make a Cask to be hoop'd •, I had a fmall Runlet or 
two, as I obferv'd before, but I could never arrive to the 
Capacity of making one by them, tho* I fpent many 
Weeks about it \ I could neither put in the Headfs, or 
join the Staves fo true to one another, as to make them 
hold Water ; fo I gave that alfo over. 

In th? next Place, I was at a great lofs for Candle ; 
fo that as foon as ever it was dark, which was generally 
by Seven o' Clocks I was ol?%ed to go to Bed. I re- 
member 



(73) 

memberM the Lump of Bees- Wax, with which I made 
Candles in my African Adventure } but I had none of 
that now : The only Remedy I had, was, that when I 
had kilPd a Goat, 1 faved the Tallow, and with a little 
Difh made of Clay, which I baked in the Sun, to 
which I added a Wick of fome Oakum, I made me a 
Lamp ; and this gaye me Light, tho' not a clear flea* 
dy Light like a Candle. In the middle of all my La- 
bours it happen*d, {hat rummaging my Things, I found 
a little Bag, whichj as I hinted before, had been fill'd 
with Cora for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Voy- 
age, but before, as I fuppofe, when the Ship came from 
Lisbon ; what little Remainder of Corn had been in the 
Bag, was all devoured with the Rats, and I law nothing 
in the Bag but Husks and Dud ; and being wil- 
ling to have the Bag for fome other Ufe, (I think it 
was to put Powder in, when I divided it for fear of 
the Lightening, or fome fuch UfeJ I fhook the Husks 
of Corn out of it on one fide of my Fortification unde r 
the Rock. 

It was a little before the great Rains, juft now men- 
tioned, that I threw this Stuff away, taking no Notice 
of any thing, and not fo much as remem bring that I 
had thrown any thing there ; when about a Month ail 
ter, or thereabouts, I faw fome few Stalks of fame thing 
• green fhooting out of the Ground, which I fancied 
might be fome Plant I had not feen ; but I was fur- 
prized and perfe&ly aflonifh'd, when after a little lon- 
ger time I faw about ten or twelve Ears come out, which 
were perfe& green Barley of the fame Kind as our Euro- 
pean, nay, as our EngUJb Barley. 

It is impofllble to exprefs the Aftonifhment and Con- 
fufion of my Thoughts on this Occafion ; I had hi- 
therto a&ed upon no religious Foundation at all ; in- 
deed I had very few Notions of Religion in my Head, 
nor had entertained any Senfe of any Thing that had 
befallen me, -other wife than as a Chance, or, as we 
lightly fay, what pleafes Go'i; without fo much as en- 
quiring into the End of Providence in thefe Things > 
or his Order in governing Events in. the World : But 
after I faw Barley grow there, in a Climate which t 
knew was not proper for Corn a and efpecially that I 

E knew 



(74) 

knew not how it came there* it Hartled me ftrarjgtjr, atit 
I began to fugged, that God had miraculouuy caus'd 
this Grain to grow without any Help of Seed fown, and 
•that it was fo dire&ed purely for my Suftenance in that 
avild miferahle Place. 

This toueh'd my Heart a little, and brought Tears 
*mt of my Eyes, and I began to blefs my felf, that fuch 
a Prodigy of Nature ihould happen upon my Account ; 
and this was the more ftrange to me, becaufe I faw near 
it (Mil, all along by the Side of the R.ock, fome other 
ilraggling Stalks, which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice, 
and which I knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa 
xtfhen I was ajfhore there, 

I not only thought thefe the pure Produ&ions of 
providence for my Support, but not doubting, but that 
there was more in the Place, I went all over that Part 
*>f thelfland, where I had been before, peering in eve- 
ry Corner, and'under every Rock, to fee for more of it, 
hut 1 could not find any; at laft it occur' d to my 
Thoughts, that I had iliouk the Bag of Chickens Meat 
cut, in that Place, and then the Wonder began to ceafe ; 
and I muft confefs, my religious Thankfulnefs to God's 
Providence began to abate too, upon the difcovering that 
all this was nothing but what was common * ? tho* I ought 
to have been as thankful lor fo ftrange and unfbrefeen 
Providence, as if it had been miraculous ; for it was 
" j-eally the Work of Providence as to me, that fhould or- 
<ler or appoint, that 10 or 12 Grains of Corn ihould re- 
anain unfpoil'd (when the Rats had deflroy'd all the 
xeft) as if it had been droptTro'm Heaven : As alio that 
I Ihould throw it out in that particular Place where, 
it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it fprang up im- 
mediately ; whereas, if I had thrown it any where elfe 
at that Time, it had been burnt up and deftroy'd. 

I carefully fav'd the Ears of this Corn, you may be 
fure in their Seafon, which was about the End of June, 
and laying up every Corn, I refolv'd to fow them all 
again, hoping in Time to have fome Quantity fufficient 
tofujpply me with Bread *, but it was hot till the 4th 
Year that I could allow my felf the lead Grain of this 
Corn >£o eat, and even then but Sparingly, asl fliafl (ay 
After wards k its Order ; for 1 loft all that I jfow'd the 

foft 



(75 ) 

$rd Seafon, not by not obferving the proper Time, for 
I fow'd it juft before the dry Seafon, lb that it never 
came up at all, at leaft, not as it would have done ; Of 
which in its Place. # 

Beiides this Barley, there was, as above, 30 -or 30 
Stalks of Rice, which 1 prefer v'd with the fame Care, and 
whole Ufe was of the fame Kind, or to the fame Pur- 
pole, {vi\.) to make me Bread, or rather Food ; for I 
ibund \\ ays to cook it up without baking, tho' I did 
that alfo alter {oniQ Time, But to return to my Jour- 
nal. 

I work'd exce&ve hard this three or four Months, t@ 
^get my, Wall done ; and the 14th of April T clo fed it up, 
contriving to go into it, not by a Door, but over a Wall 
by a Ladder, that there might be no Sign on the Outfide 
of my Habitation. 

April 16. I finifh'd the Ladder, ^o I went up with 
the Ladder to the Top, and then pulFd it up after me, 
and let it down on the Infide : This was a compleat; 
Enclofure to me ; for within I had room enough, and 
nothing could come at me from without, unlefs it could 
fir ft. mount my Wall, 

The very next Day after this W 7 all was finiih'd, I had 
almoft had all my Labour overthrown at once, and my 
felf kilPd ; the Cafe was thus : As I was bufy in the 
Infide of it, behind my Tent, jufl in the Entrance in- 
to my Cav£, I was terribly frighted with a mod dread- 
ful furprixing thing indeed ; for all on a fudderi I founi 
the Earth came tumbling down from the Roof a£ my 
Cave, and from the Edge of the Hill over my Head, 
and two of -the Pofts I had let up in the Cave, crack'd 
in a frightful manner : I was heartily feared, but thought 
nothing of what really was the Caufe ; only thinking 
that the Top of my Cave was falling in, as fome of it 
-had done before •, and for fear I ihould be buried in it, 
,1 ran./forw^rd.to my Ladder, and not thinking my felf 
fafe there neither., I got over my Wall for fear of the 
Pieces of the Hill which I expe&ed might roll down up- 
on me I was no fooner ftept down upon the £rm 
Ground, but i plainly faw it was a terrible Earthquake, 
for the Ground I ftood on fhook three Times, at about 
-eight Minutes Diltance^ with three fuch Shocks as 
... . E 2 would 



( 7* ) 

would bare overturned the ftrongeft Building that 
could be fuppofed to have ftood on the Earth ; and a 
great Piece or' the Top of a Rock, which {|ood about 
half a Mile from me text the Sea, fell down with fuch 
a terrible Noife, as I never heard in all my Life. I 
perceived alfo, the very Sea was put into a violent Mo- 
tion by it ; and I believe the Shocks were ftronger under 
the W ater than on the Ifland. 

I was jb amaz'd with the Thing it felf, having never 
felt the like, or diicours'd with any one that had, that 
I was like one dead or ftupified \ and the Motion of 
the Earth made my Stomack fick, like one that was 
tofs'd at Sea ; but the Noife oi" the falling of the Rock 
awaked me, as it were, and rouzing me from the ftu- 
pified Condition I was in, fiJPd me with Horror, and 
I thought of nothing then but the Hill falling upon my 
Tent, and all my Houihold-Goods, and burying all at 
once •, and this funk my very Soul within me a fecond 
time. 

After the third Shock was over, and I felt no more 
for fome Time, I began to take Courage, and yet I had 
not Heart enough to get over my Wall again, for fear 
of being buried alive, but fat ftill upon the Ground, 
greatly caft down and difconlblate, not knowing what 
to do ; All this while i had not the leaft lerious reli- 
gious Thought, nothing but the common, Lord hat 
Mercy upon mc \ and when it was over, that went away 
too. 

\§lhile I fat thus, I found the Air over-caft, and it grew 
cloudy, as if it would rain; and in lefs than half an Hour 
it blew a moil dreadful Hurricane of Wind ; The Sea 
ail on a iudden cover'd with Foam and Froth, the 
Shore was cover'd with the Breach of the Water, the 
Trees were torn up by the Roots, and a terrible Storm 
it was ; and this held about three Hours, and then be- 
gan to abate, and then in two Hours more it was calm, 
and began to rain very hard. 

All this while I fat upon the Ground very much ter- 

1 rifled anddeje&ed, when on a fudden it came into my 

thoughts, that theie Winds and Rain being the Con- 

fequenee of the Earthquake, the Earthquake it felf 

was fpent and over, and I might venture into my Cave 

again# 



(77) 

again : With this Thought my Spirits began to revive, 
and the Rain helping alio to perfwade me, I went in 
and fat down in my Tent; hut the Rain was lb vio- 
lent, that my Tent was ready to be beaten down, 
with it^ and I was forced to go into my Cave, tho' 
Very much afraid and uneafy, for fear it iliould fall on 
my Head, 

This violent Rain forced me to a new Work, vi%, to 
cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a Sink to let 
the Water go out, which would elfe have dro wn'd my 
Care. After I had been in my Cave fome time, and 
found flill no more Shocks of the Earthquake follow, I 
^egan to be more compoied *, and now, to fupport my 
Spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to 
my little Store, and took a fmall Sup of Rum, which 
however I did then and always very fparingly, know- 
ing I could have no more when that was gone. 

it continued raining all that Night, and great part 
of the next Day, lb that I could not flir abroad ; but 
my Mind being more compoied, I began to think of 
what I had bell do, concluding, that if the Ifland was 
iubjed to thefe Earthquakes, there would be no living 
for me in a Cave, but I muft confider of building me 
fome little Hut in an open Place, which I might fur- 
round with a Wall s as I had done here, and lb make 
my felf fecure from wild Beafls or Men ; but concluded, 
if i (laid where I was, I fliould certainly, one time or 
ether, be buried alive. 

. With thefe Thoughts I refolv'd to remove my Cent 
frOm^the Place where, it flood, which was juft under 
the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and w r hich, if it 
fhould be fhaken again, would certainly fall upon my 
Tent.* Arid T fpent the two next Days, being the 19th 
a.nd 20th ofjpnly in contriving where and how to re- 
move my Habitation. 

The Fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made me, that 
I never flept in quiet; arid yet th£ Apprehenflon of 
lying abroad without any Fqnce, was almoft equal to 
it : But dill, when I look'd about, and fav? how every 
thing was put in Order, how pleafantly conceal'd I 
was#and how fafe from Danger, it made me very loth. 
to remove. 

E 3 In 



( 78 ) 

In the mean time it occurr'd to me, that it would! 
squire a vaft deal ot Time for me to do this, and that 
I mult, he contented to run the Venture where I was, 
til) I had form'd a Camp for my felf, and had fecured 
it Co as to remove to it : So with this Refolufion I com- 
poied my felf for a Time, andrefolv'd that I would go 
to work with all fpeed to build me a Wall with Piles 
and Cables, $$c. in a Circle, as before, and let my Tent 
up in it when it was finiih'd, but that I would venture 
to flay where I was, till it was finifh'd and fit to re* 
move to. This was the 2 ill. 

April 22. The next Morning I began to consider of 
Means to put this Refolve in execution; but. I was aft 
a great Lofs about my Tools: I had three la^ge Axes, 
and abundance of Hatchets, ( for we carried the Hat- 
chets for Traffic with the Indians ) but with much chop- 
ping and cutting knotty hard Wood, they were all full 
©f Notches, and dull ; and tho' I had a Grindftone, t 
could not turn it and grind my Tools too ; This cofl 
me as much Thought as a Statefman would have be- 
'How'd i$pon a grand Point of Politicks, or a Judge 
Upon the Life and Death of a Man. At length I con* 
trived a W heel with a String, to turn it with my Foot, 
that I might have both nay Hands at 'Liberty* N&e£ 
I had not feen any fuch ThJig in England^ or it lead 
cot to take Notice how it w^s done, .tho* fince t have 
obferved, it is very common there $ befides that, my 
Grindftone was very large and heavy. This Machine 
cod we a full Week's Work, to bring it to Perfection. 

April. &, 29. Thefe two whole Days I took upii* 
grinding my Tools, my Machine lor turning my Gririd- 
ftone performing very well. 

April 30. Having perceived my Bread had been low 
a great while, I now took a Survey of it, and reduced 
my felf to one Bisket-cake a Day, which made my Hear* 
Very heavy. 

May 1. Tn the Morning looking towards the Sea-* 
fide, the Tide being low* I law ibmethtt-jg lie on the; 
Shore Mgger than ordinary, and it look'<aVlike a 'Cask 5 
when I came wit, I found a fmall Barrel, and two or 
three Pieced' of the Wreck of the -Ship, which <#ere 
driven on Shore by the late Hurricane, and looking to- 
"« , wards 



(79 } 

wards the Wreck it felf, I thought it feemed to He- 
higher out of the Water than it ufed to do > I examinee^ 
the Barrel which was driven on Shore, and Toon found 
it was a Barrel of Gun-powder, but it had taken Wal- 
ter, arid the Powder was caked as hard as a Stone ; 
However, I rolled it farther on Shore for the prefent, 
and went on upon the Sands, as near as I could to the 
Wreck of the 5hip, to look for more* 

When I came down to the Ship,. I found it ilrange- 
ly removed .• The Forecaftle, which lay before buried 
in Sand, was heav'd up at leaft fix Foot, and the Stern, 
which was broke to pieces, and parted from the reft by 
the Force of the Sea, foon after I had left rummaging, 
of her, was tofs'd as it were up, and call on one side, 
and the Sand was thrown fo high on that Side next the 
Stern, th<lt whereas there was a great Place of Water be- 
fore, fo that I could not come within a Quarter of a 
Mile of the Wreck without fwimming, I could now 
walk quite up to her when the Tide was oitt, ^ I was 
furprized with this at firfl:, but ioon concluded itmufc 
be done by the Earthquake; and. as by this Violence the 
Ship was more broken open than formerly, i'o many 
things came daily on Shore which the Sea had loofen'd, 
2nd which the Winds and Water rolled by degrees to 
the land, **-. 

This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the Defign 
of removing my Habitation; and I bulled my lelf 
mightily that Day efpecially, in fearching whether I 
could make any way into the Ship, but I found nothing 
was to be erpe&ed of that kind, for that all the infide 
of the Ship was choak'd up with Sand : However, as I 
had learnt not to defpair of any thing, I refolved to 
pull every thing to pieces that I could of the Ship, con- 
cluding that every thing I could get from her would be 
•f fome life or other to me. 

May 3. I began with my Saw, and cut a Piece of a 
Beam thro', which I thought held fome of the upper 
fart, or Quarter-Deck, together, and when I had cut 
it thro', I cleared away the Sand as welT as I could, 
from the Side which lay higheft ; but the Tide coming , 
in, I was obliged to give over for that time.

May 4. I went a-fifhing, but caught not one Fiih that 
I durfl eat of, till I was weary of my Sport, when 
juft going to leave off, I caught a young Dolphin. I 
had made me a long Line of fome Rope-Yarn, but I 
had no Hooks, yet I frequently caught Fiih enough, as 
much as I cared to eat 5 all which I dry ed in the Sun, 
and eat them dry. 

May 5, Work'd on the Wreck, cut another Beam 
afunder, and brought three great Fir Planks off from 
the Decks, which I tied together, and made fwim on 
Shore when the Tide of Flood came on. 

May 6. Work'd on the Wreck, got feveral Iron Bolts 
cut of her, and other Pieces of Iron Work, work'd very 
bard, and came home very much tir'd, and hadThoughts 
of giving it over. 

May 7. Went to the Wreck again, but with an Intent 
not to work, but found the Weight of the Wreck had 
broke it ielf down, the Beams being cut, that feveral 
Pieces of the Ship feem'd to lye looie, and the Infide of 
the Hold lay fo open, that I could fee into it, but al- 
mouY full of Water and Sand. 

May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carried an Iron 
"Craw to wrench up the Deck, which lay now quite 
clear of the Water or Sand ; I wrench'd open two 
Planks, and brought them on Shore alio with the 
Tide : I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for next Day. 

May 9. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow 
made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and felt feyeral 
,Casks> and loofenM them with the Crow,' but could 
not break them up; I felt alfo the Roll of Engl ?Jh Lead. 
&nd could ilir it, but it was too heavy to move. 

May 10, ii, 12, 13, 14. Went every Day to the 
Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Timber and 
Boards, or Plank, and 2 or 300 Weight of Iron. 

May 1 5. I carried two Hatchets to try if I could not 
cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by placing the Edge 
of one Hatchet, and di iving it with the other ; but as it 
Jay about a Foot and a half in the Water, I could not 
make any Blow to drive the Hatchet. 

May 16. It had blow'd hard in the Night, and the 
Wreck appeared more broken by the Force of the Wa- 
ter } but I ftay'd fo long in the Woods to get Pidgeons 

for 



( 8I .)■ 

for Food, that the Tide prevented me going to the 
Wreck that Day. 

May 17. I faw fqttte pieces of the Wreck blown on 
Shore, at a great Diftance, two Miles off me, but re- { 
iblv'd to fee what they were, and found it was a pieces 
of the Head, but too heavy for me to bring away. 

May 24. Every Day to this Day I work'd on the 
Wreck, and with hard Labour I loofen'd fome things ib 
much with the Crow, that fjae iirft blowing Tide fe- 
veral Casks floated out, and two of the Seamen's 
Chefls; but the Wind blowing from the Shore, no- 
thing came to Land that Day, but pieces of Timber, 
ati'4 a Hogfliead which had fome Brazil Pork in it, but 
the Salt-water and the Sand had fpoil'dit. 

I continue4 this Work every Day to the i<(th of 
Ju?ie, except the Time neceffary to get Food, which I 
always appointed, during this Part of my Employment, 
to be when the Tide was up, that I might be ready 
when it was ebb'd out, and by this Time J had gotten 
Timber, and Plank, and Iron-Work enough to have 
built a good Boat, if I had known how > and alio I got 
at feveral times, and in feveral Pieces, near 100 Weight* 
of the Sheet-Lead, 

June 16. Going down to the Sea-fide, T found a large 
Tortoiie* or Turtle ; this was the firft Iliad feen, which 
it ieerris was only my Misfortune, not any Defe& of 
the Place, or Scarcity \ for had I happsn'd to be on the 
other Side of the Ifland, I might have had Hundreds of 
them every Day, as I found afterwards \ but perhaps 
had paid dear enough for them. 

June 17. • I fpent in cooking the Turtle ; I found in 
her three-feore Bggs V and her Flefh was to me at that 
time the moft favouty and pleafant that ever I tailed in 
ray Life, having had ho- Fleih, but of Goats and Fpwls> 
iince f landed in this horrible Place. 

June 18. Rairi'd all- Day, and T ftay'd within. I 
thought at this tithe the Rain felt cold, and I was fome* 
thing chilly, which* I knew was not ufual in that La- 
titude. 

June 19. Very ill, and ihiverlng 3 as if the Weather; 
had been cold* 

; • ■ , ■- E «J JwK2&* 



June 20. No Reft all, Jlight, violent Pains in my. 
Head, and feveriih. 

June 21 • Very ill, frighted almoft to Death with 
the Apprehenfions of my fad Condition, to be fick, 
and no Help : Pray'd to God for the iirft Time fince 
the Storm o/f of Hull, but fcarce knew what I laid, or 
why; my Thoughts being all confuild. 

June 22. A little better, but under dreadful Appre- 
henfions of Sicknefs. 

June 23. Very bad again, cold and fjuvering> and 
then a violent Head-ach. 

June 24. Much better. 

June 25. An Ague^very violent; the Pit held me 
ftven Hours, cold Fit and hot, with faint Sweats af- 
ter it r ' # 

June 26. Better ; and having no Vi&uals to eat, took 
my Gun, but found my felf very weak; however I 
kill'd a She-Goat, and with much Difficulty got -fc* 
Home, and broird fome of it, and $zf 9 I would Tain, 
have ftewed it, and made fome Broath, but had no &ot. 

June 27. The Ague aga^nfo violent, that I lay a-bed 
all Day, and neither eat or drank.* I was r ready to pe- 
rifli lor Thirft, but ib weak, I had not Strength to 
ftand up, or to get my felf any Water to dr>ink: ^Pray'd 
to God again, but was light-headed,, and t ^qn I was 
not, Twas fo ignorant,. 2iat I knew aot what to fayf 
only I lay and _cry'd, '.iord kok upon me^ JLord pity me r 
Zordbave Mercy upon me : Tfuppofel did nothing ejfe 
for two or three Hours, till the Fit wearing off, L fej[ 
aflcep, and did not wake till far in the Night. Wherr 
I wak'd, I found my fell much refrefh'd, but weak, and 
exceeding thirfty : However, as I had no Water in my 
whole Habitation, I was forc'd to lye till Morning, and 
went to fleep again : Iji this feqond, Skejpj I had tbi* 
terrible Dream. .«... p| .;;-.. '

Outfide of my , Wall, where I iat when the §tprm Mew. 
after the Earthquake, and that I fawia^ Man defcend 
irom a great black Cloud, in a bright Flame of, Fire, 
and light upon the Ground : He was all over as bright 
as a Flame* Co that I could but juft bear to look towards 
Urn j his Countenance was moft inespreffibly dreadful, 

impofliWe 



( 83 ) 

impofTible for Words todefcrihe ; when lie ftepp'd up- 
on the Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth 
trembled, juftasit had done before In the Earthquake, 
and all the Air look'd, to my Apprehenfion, as if it 
had been fill'd with Flafhes of Fire. 

He was no fooner landed upon the Earth, hut he 
moved forward towards me, with a long Spear or Wea- 
pon in his Hand, to kill me ; and when he came to a 
riling Gxonpdy at fome Diftance, he f poke to me, or I 
heard a Voice fo terrible, that it is impoffible to exprefs 
the Terror of it ; all that I can fay, I underftood, was 
this, "Seeing all tbefc Things have not hr aught thee to Re* 
pentance, now thou Jhalt die : At which Words,- 1 thought 
he lifted up the Spear that was in his Hand to kill me, 

No one that Ihall ever read this Account, willexpedfc- 
that I fhould be able # defer ibe the Horrors of my Soul 
at this terrible Vifion ; I mean, that even while it was 
a Dream, I even dreamed of thofe Horrors \ nor is it 
any more poifible to defcribe the ImpreiEon that re- 
main'd' upon my Mind when I awaked and found i£~ 
was but a Dream. 

I had, alas! no divine Kngwledge ; what I had re- 
ceived by the good kiftru&ion of my Father, was then 
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of 
Seafearing Wicked'nefs, and a conftant Qonfervation with 
nothing .but fuch as were' like my felf, wicked and pro* 
fane to ,the laft Qegree ; I do not remember that I had" 
in all tliat Time one Thought that fo much as tended 
either to looking upwards towards God, or inwards'* - 
towards a Reflection * upon my own ways; But a cer- 
tain Stupidity of Soul, without, De/ire of Good,,or Con- 
ference of Evil, had entirely overwhelmed me, and I 
was, all that the mod: hardned, unthinking wicked 
Creature among our common Sailors can be fuppofed to 
be, not having the leaft Senfe, either, of the Fear of 
God in Dangers* or of Thankfulnefs to God in fDeli^ 
verances. 

In the relating what is already pad" of my Story j this 
will be the more eafily believed, when I ihall add, that, 
thro' all the Variety of Miferies that had to this Day 
befallen me, I never had fo much as one Thought, of. 
its ..-being' the Hand of God, or thatJt was a juft Punilh*. 

" merit : 



C»4 ) 

nient fbr my Sin, my rebellious Behaviour againft my 
Father, or my prefent Sins, which were great; or (b 
much as a Puniiliment for the general Courfe of my 
wicked Life. When I was on the defperate Expedi- 
tion on the defait- Shores of Africa, I never had fa 
much as one Thought of what would become of me, 
or one Wiih to God to dire& me whither I ihould go, 
or to keep me from the Danger which apparently fur- 
rounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as cruel 
Savages : But I was meerly thoughtlefs of God, or a 
Providence, a&ed like a meer Brute from the Princi- 
ples of Nature, and by the Di&ates of common Senfe 
only, and indeed hardly that. 

When Fwas deliver'd and taken up at Sea by the 
Tortugal Captain, well ufed, and dealt juftly and ho- 
nourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the 
lead Thankfulnefs in my Thoughts : When again I was 
Ihipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in Danger of drowning on this 
Ifland, [ was as far from Remorfe, or looking on it as 
a Judgment \ I only faid to my felf often, that I was 
an zmfrtunate Dng i and born to be always miferable. 

It is true, when I got on fhore firft here, and found, 
all my Ship's Crew drowned, and my felf fpared, I 
was lurpriz'd with a kind of Extafy, and fdme TranP 
ports of Soul, which, had the grace of God affifted, 
might have come up to true Thankfulnefs \ but it end- 
ed where it begun, in a meer common Flight of Joy, or, 
as I may fay, being glad 1 was alive, without the lead 
RefledHbn upon the diftinguifhing Goodnefs oftheHand. 
which had preierved me, and had fingled me out to be, 
preferv'd, when all the reft were deftroy'd ; or an En- 
quiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me ; 
even juft the fame common fort of Joy which Seamen. 

fenerally have after they have got iafe a fhore from a. 
hipwreck, which they drown all in the next Bowl of 
Punch, and forget ahnoft as ibon as it is QVer, and all 
the reft of my Life was like it. 

Even when I was afterwards, on due Confederation, 
made fenfible of my Condition, how I wascafton this 
dreadful Place, out of the Reach of human Kind, out 
of all Hope of Relief, or Profpe& of Redemption, a$ 
foonasl faw but a Profpeift of living, and that I 

ihould 



( «5 ) 

fliould not ftarve and perifh for Hunger, all the Senfe 
of my AfRi&ion wore off, and I begun to be very eafy, 
apply'd myfelftothe Works proper ibr my Prefervation 
and Supply, and was far enough from being affii&ed at 
my Condition, as a Judgment from Heaven, or as the 
Hand of God againft me : Thefewere Thoughts which 
very feldom enter'd into my Head. 

1 The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my Jour- 
nal, had at iirft ibme little Influence upon me, and 
began to affed me with Serioufnefs, as long as I thought 
it had fomething miraculous in it; butasfoonas ever 
that Part of the Thought was removed, all the Impref- 
iion which was raifed irom it wore off alfo, as I have 
noted already. 

Even the Earthquake, tho* nothing could be more 
terrible in its Nature, or more immediately directing 
to the vifible Power, which alone directs mch things, 
yet no fooner was the iirft Fright over, but the Im- 
preifion it had made went off alio. I had no more Senfe 
of God or his Judgments, much lefsof the prefent Affli- 
ction of my Circumftances, being from hisHancL than 
if I had been in the moil profperous Condition ot Life. 

But now when I began to be fick, and a leifurely 
ViewoftheMiferiesof Death came to place it felfbe. 
fore me *, when my Spirits began to fink under the Bur- 
den of a ftrong Diftemper, and Nature was exhaufted 
with the Violence of the Fever; Conference, that had 
flept fo long, began to awake, and I began to reproach 
my felf with my pad Life, in which I had fo evidently, 
by uncommon Wickednefs, provoked the Juftice of 
God to lay me under uncommon Strokes, and to deal 
with me in fo vindictive a manner. 

Thefe Reflections oppreis'd me for the feeond or third 
Day of my Diftemper, and in the Violence, as well of 
the Fever as of the dreadful Reproaches of my Con- 
fcience, extorted fome Words from me, like praying 
to God, tho* I cannot fay they wese either a Prayer at- 
tended with Deiires, or with JJdpes *, it was rather the 
Voice of meer Fright and Diftrefs ; my Thoughts were 
confufed, the Convictions great upon my Mind, and 
the Horror of dying in fuch a miferable Condition 
raifed Vapours into my Head with the meer Appre, 

henftons* 



(,8<J) 

henfions; and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I know nor 
what my Tongue might exprefs •: But it was rather 
Exclamation, iuch as, Lord ! what a miferable Crea- 
ture am I ! If I fhould he ficjc, I jfha.11 certainly die for 
want of Help, and what will "become of me ! Then the 
Tears buril out of my Eyes, and I could fay no more 
a good while. 

Xn this interval,, the good Advice of my Father came 
to my Mind, and presently his Prediction, which Tmen. 
tion'd in the beginning of this Story, viz. That if 'I did 
take tbisfoolijb Stefa Godmuhlnot blefs me y and 1 mould 
bave Leifurs hereafter to reflect upon, having negktted bis 
Cgunjely when there might be none to affifl . me in n® Rd- 
covery. Now, faid I aloud, my dear Father's Words- 
are come to pa/s : God's j uilice has overtaken me, and 
I have -none to help or hea,r me ; T reje&ed the Voice of 
Providence, which had mercifully put me in a Pofttre 
of Station of life, Wherein I might have been happy 
apd eafy ; ,but I would neither fee it my fel£ or learn 
to know the Bleflihg of it from my Parents ; I left them 
to mourn over, my folly,, and now I am left to mourn 
under the Conferences of it : I refufed their Help and 
Ajfliftance, who would have lifted me into the World, 
and would have made every thing qafy to me, and new 
I have Difficulties to ftruggle with, too great for even 
N^ure itfcl^to/uppoft, and r rio Affiilanoe, no Help, no 
Coifort, no JWyicV Then I cry'd out, JLofd be my

and broll'd it on the Coajs, But could eat very little ; 
I* walked about, but was very weak, and withal, very 
fad and heavy- hearted in the Sejnle ofniy miferahle Con- 
dition, dreading the Return of my Diitemper the next

every Thing that happened in the World. Immediate- 
ly it follovv'd. ' /.'.'< 

Why has God done thistdmet What have I done to be 
thus us*d ? 

My Confcience presently check'd me in that Enquiry, 
as if I had blafphem'd, and methought it fpoke to me like 
a Voice; WRElCH ! dofl thou ask what thou haft dme ! 
Look back upon a dreadful mif-fpent Life, and ask thy 
felf what thou baft not done ? Ask, Why is it that thou wen 
not long ago deftrofd ? Why wert thou not drown' d in Yar* 
riiouth Roads? Killed in the Fight when the Ship was 
taken by the Sallee Man of War ? Devout* d by the wild. 
Beafts en the C$aft of A frica ? Or, drowtfd H ERE, when 
all the Crew perffid but thyfelfl Dofl: thou ask, What 
have I done ? 

I was ftruck dumb with thefe Reflexions, as one a- s 
ftonifhed, and had not a Word to fey, no not to anfwer 
to my felf, but rofe up penfiye and fad, walk'd back to 
my Retreat, and went up over my Wall, as if I had 
been going to Bed, but my Thoughts were fadly di- 
fturb'd, and I had no inclination to deep •, fo I fat down 
in my Chair, and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be 
dark. Now, as the Apprehenfion of the return of my 
PSftemper terrify'd n%e \ery much, it, occur'd to my 
Thought, that the Brafilians take no Phyflck but their 
Tobacco, for almoft all Diftempers ; and I had a Piece 
6f a Roll of Tobacco, in one of the Chefts, which was 
quite cured, and ^brhe alfo that was green, and not 
quite cured. 

I went, dire&ed by Heaven no doubt, for in this, 
Cheft I found a Cure both for Soul and Body ; I open- 
ed the Cheft, and found what I rlook'd for, vi%. the 
Tobacco ; and as the few Books I had fav.'d lay there 
too, I took out one of the Bibles which I mentioned 
before, and which to this time I had not found Leifure, 
or fo much as Inclination to look into ; I fay, 1 took it 
out, and broughf both that and the Tobacco with me 
to the Table. 

What Ufe to make of the Tobacco, I knew not, as 
to my Diftemper, or whether it was good for it or no j' 
but I try'd feveral- Experiments with it, as if I was re- 

iblv'd 



( *9 ) 

folv'd it fhould, hit one Way or other : I firft took a 
Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it -in my Mouth, which 
indeed at firft almofi ftupify'd my Brain, the Tobacco 
being green and ftrong, and that I had not been much 
us'd to it ; then I took fome and fteeped it an Hour or 
two in Rum, and refolv'd to take a Dofe of it when I 
lay down ; and laflly, I burnt fome upon a Pan of Coals, 
and held my Nofe clofe over the Smoke of it as long 
as T could bear it, as well for the Heat as the Virtue 
of it, and I held it almoft to Suffocation. 

In the interval of this Operation, I took up tfffc Bi- 
ble and began to read, but my Head was too much du 
fturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading, at leaft at that 
time; only having open'd the Book cafually, thefirft 
Words that occur* d to me were thefe, Call on me in the 
Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou Jhalt glorify 
me* 

The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made 
fome Impreflion upon my Thoughts at the Time of read- 
ing them, tho' not fo much as they did afterwards \ for 
as for being deliver'd, the Word had no Sound, ds I 
ma y f a f> to me ; the Thing was fo remote, fo impoflt- 
He in my Apprehenfion of Things, that I began to fay 
as the Children of Jfratl did, when they were promis'd 
Flefh to eat, Can Godfpread a Table in the Wildernefs ? 
So I began to to fay, Can God himfelf deliver me from 
this Place ? And as it was not for many Years that any 
Hope appear'd, this prevail'd very often upon my 
Thoughts : But however, the Words made a great Im- 
preffion upon me, and I muled upon them very often. 
It grew now late, and the Tobacco had, as I faid, doz'd 
my Head {o much, that I inclin'd to deep -, fo I left 
*ny Lamp burning in the Cave, left I fhould want any 
thing in the Night, and went to Bed ; but before I lay 
down, I did what I never had done in all myLife, I kneel- 
ed down and pray'd to God to fulfil the FVomife to me, 
that if I call'd upon him in the Day of Trouble, he 
would deliver me ; after my broken and imperfect Pray- 
er was over, I drunk the Rum in which I had fteep'd 
the Tobacco, which was fo ftrong and rank of the To- 
tacco, that indeed I could fcarce get it down. Imme- 
diately upon this I went to Bed, and I found prefently it 



( 90 ) 

5ew:up into my Head violently ; but I fell into a found 
Sleep, and waked ao more till by the Sun it muft ne~ 
ceflarily be near Three o' Clock in the Afternoon the 
next Day; nay, to this Hour I am partly of the Opi- 
nion, that Iflept all the next Day and Night, and till 
almofl: . three the Day after ; for otherwile I knew not 
how I ftould lofe a Day out of my Reckoning in the 
Days of the Week, as it appeared fome Years after I 
had done; for if I had loft it by croffmg and re-crciUng, 
the Line, Imou*ld have lof: more -than a Day, but in my 
Account, it was loft, and I never knew v. inch way. 

Be that however one way or other, when I awak'd 
I found my Self exceedingly refrefh'd, and my Spirits 
lively and chearftfl $ when I got up> I was ftron^er than 
! was ;t)ie Day oefore, and my Stomach better, fori 
was hungry ; and in fliort, I had no Fit the next Day,, 
but continued much alter'd for the better : this was the 
29th. 

The 30th was my Well Day of Coi:rfe, and I went 
abroad with my Gun, but did not care to travel too 
6r : I kill'd a Sea- Fowl or two, lbmething like a 
Brand-Goofe, and brought them Home, but? was noft 
very forward to. eat them ; fo I eat fome more of the 
Turtle's EggSj, which were very good .• This Evening 
I renew'd the Medicine which I had fuppofed did me 
good the Day before, vi\* the Tobacco iceep'd in Rum, 
Qnly J[ 4id not take Jo much as before, nor did I chew 
any, of .the. Leaf^ or hold my Head over the Smoke ; 
however, J .wa? aot fo ; well the next Day, which was 
the ill qfjptyi as I £oped I mould have been ; for I 
h?a4 a little fpice of tlie cold Fit, but it was not 
mush. 

July 7.1 renew'd the Medicine all the three ways* 
and dozed m^ lelf with it as at firft, and doubled the 
Quantity which I drank. 

3. I mifs'd the Fit for good and all, tho* I did cot 
recover my full Strength for fome Weeks after : While 
I. was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts run ex- 
ceedingly upon this Scripture, 1 will deliver tbee ; and 
tlie Imp/)fl$>iUty of my Deliverance lay much upon 
my Mind, in bar of my ever expecting it: But as 
I was difcouraging my fclf with fuch Thoughts, it 

eccur'd 



( ft ) 

©ccur'd to my Mind, that I pored lb much upon mf 
Deliverance from the main A ffii&ion, that I disregarded 
the Deliverance; I - had received \ and I was, as it were, 
made to ask my felt fuch Queflions as thefe, vi%. Have 
I not been deliver'd, and wonderfully too, from Sick- 
nefs ? From the- moil diflreis'd Condition that could be* 
and that was fo : frightful to me ? And what notice had I 
taken of it ? Had 1 done my Part, God had delivered me 9 
hut I bad not glorified him: That is to, fay, I had not 
©wn'd and been thankful for that as a Deliverance, and 
how could I expe& greater Deliverance ? 

This touch'd.my.Heart very much, and immediately 
J kneel?d ,do*wn and- gave God Thanks aloud, for my 
Recovery from my -Sicknefe. 

JulfA* Ih ; the-4loxning I topk the Bible, and .begin- 
ning ^ the ifoyf Teftamcnt,. I began ferioufly to read 
it, and impofed upon my felf to read a while every 
Morning and every Night, not tying my ielf to the 
Number of Chapters, but as long as my Thoughts 
fhculd engage me : It was not long alter i let ferioufly 
to thi$ VVork, in*t & founol my Heart- more -deeply and 
fincerely aflfc'&ed with the VVickedneis of my pail Life: 
The\Ittap*eiTion of; my %eam .r.eyiv'd,. and the>Word%

(9* ) 

Now I began to conftrue the Words mentioned a- 
bove, Call on me> and 1 will deliver you, in a different 
Senfe from what I had ever done before ; for then I had 
no Notion of any thing being called Deliverance, but 
my being delivered from the Captivity I was in, for 
tho' I was indeed at large in the Place, yet the I (land 
was certainly a Prifon to me, and that in the word 
Senfe in the World ; but now Hearn'd to take it in an- 
other Senfe. Now I look'd back lipon my paft Life 
with fuch Horror, and my Sins appear'd fo dreadful, 
that my Soul fought nothing of God, but Deliverance 
From the Load of Guilt that bore down all my Com- 
fort. As for my folitary Life it was nothing; I did 
not £o much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of 
it ; it was all or no Confideration in Comparifon to this ; 
and I added this Part here, to hint to whoever fhall 
read it, that whenever they come to a true Senfe of 
things, they will find Deliverance from Sin a much 
greater Blefling, than Deliverance from Affli&ion. 

But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal. 

My Condition began now to be, tho' not lefs refer- 
able as to my Way of living, yet much eafier to my 
Mind; and my Thoughts being dire£ed, by a conftant 
reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to things of 
higher Nature ; I had a great deal of Comfort within, 
which till now I knew nothing of: Alfo, as my Health 
and Strength returned, I beftirr'd my felf to furniih my 
felf with every thing that I wanted, and make my way 
of living as regular as I could. 
* From the 4th of July to the Htb* I was chiefly em- 
ployed in walking about with my Gun in my Hand, 
a little and a little at a time, as a Man that was ga- 
thering up his Strength after a Fit of Sicknefs : For it 
is hardly to be imagin'd* how low I was, and to what 
Weaknefs I was redue d. The Application which I 
made ufe of, was perfectly new, and' perhaps what had 
never cur'd an Ague before ; neither can I recommend 
it to any «ne to pra&ice, by this Experiment ; and tho' 
it did carry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed to 

weaken , 



C n ) 

weaken me } for I had frequent Comrulfions in my 
Nerves and Limbs for feme time. 

I learnt from it alio this in particular, that being 
abroad in the rainy $eafon, was the moft pernicious 
thing to my Health that could be, efpecially in thofe 
Rains which came attended with Storms and Hurricanes 
of Wind ; for as the Rain which came in a dry Seafon 
was always moft accompanied with fuch Storms, fo t 
found that Rain was much more dangerous than the 
Rain which fell in September and Oftober. 

I had been now in this unhappy Ifland above 10 
Months ; all Pofftbility of Deliverance from this Condi- 
tion feenfd to be entirely taken from me 5 and Ilirml/ 
believed, that no human Shape had ever fet Foot up- 
on that Place. Having now fecur'd my Habitation, as 
I thought, fully to my Mind, I had a great Defire to 
make a more perfe<ft Difcovery of the Iuand, and to fee 
what other Produ&ions I might find, which yet I knew 
nothing of. 

It was the x$th of July that I began to take a more 
particular Survey of the Ifland it lelf: I went up the 
Creek firft, where, as I hinted, I brought my Hafts on 
Shore. I found, after I catne about two Miles up, that 
the Tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no 
more than a little Brook of running Water, and very 
frefh and good \ but this being the dry Seafon, there 
was hardly any Water in fome Parts of it, at leafl 
not enough to run in any Stream, fo as it could be 
perceiv'd. 

On the Ba.nk of this Brook I found many pleafant 
Savantfsy or Meadows, plain, fmooth, and cover'd with 
Grafs; and on the riling Parts of them next to the 
higher Grounds, where the Water, as it might be tup- 
poied, never overflowed, I found a great deal of To- 
bacco, green and growing to a great and very ftrong 
Stalk : There were divers other Plants which I had no 
Notion of, or Underftanding about, and might per- 
haps have Virtues of their own, which I could not 
And out. 

I iearched for the Cajava Root, which the Indians 
in all that Climate make their Bread of, but I could 

And 



(to) 



Ibid none« t few lafge Plants of Aloes, but did not 
then underftand them. I few feveral Sugar*. (Janes, but 
wi\d y and for Want of Cultivation, imperfed. I con- 
tented my felf with 'thefe' Difcoveries for this time, and 
came back muling with my felf what Courfe I might 
take to know the Virtue and Goodnefs of any of the 
Fruits or Plants which I fiiould difcoyer, but could 
bring it to no Conclufion ; for in fhort, I had made fo 
little Obferyation while I was in the Brafih, that I 
Jcnew little of the Plants in the Field, at lead very little 
that might ierve me to any Purpofe now in my 
Diftrefi,. 

The next Day, the 16th, I went up the fame Way a* 
gain, and after going fomething farther than 1 had 
gone the Day before, I found the Brook and the Sa 1 * 
vtwa's began to ceafe, and the Country became more 
woody than before. In this Part I found different 
Fruits, and particularly I found Melons upon the 
Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes upon the 
Trees ; the Vines had ipread indeed over th£ Trees, 
and the Clutters of Grapes were jdl How in their Prime, 
very ripe and rich. This was a furprrzing Difcovery, 
and I was exceeding glad of them ; but 1 was warn'd 
hy my Experience to eat fparingly of them, remembring, 
that when I was afhore in Barbary y the eating of 'Grapes 
fciird feveral of our EngUjk Men who were Slaves there, 
by throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers ; But I found 
an excellent iJfe for thele Grapes, and that was to cure 
cr dry them in the Sun, and keep, them as dry'd Grapes 
or Raifins are kept, which I thought would be, as in- 
deed they were, as wholefome, and as agreeable to eat, 
when no Grapes might be had. 

I fpent all that Evening there, and went not back to 
tny Habitation, which by the way was the £rfc Night, as 
1 might fay, I had lain from Home. In the Night I took 
my firft Contrivance, , and got up into a Tree, : \vherc 
I ilept well, and the next Morning proceeded upon 
my Difcovery, travelling near foUr Miles, as I might 
judge by the Length jof the Vally, keeping dill due 
Nx>rtb» with a Ridge of Hills on tHe South- arid North* 
J&deofoie. 



lis) 

At the End of this March I came to an Opening, 1 
where the Country feem'd to defcend to the Weft, and 
a little Spring of frefti Water, which iffued out of the 
Side of the Hill by me, run the other W T ay, that is, 
due Eaft ; and the Country appeared fo frefli, lb green, 
£o ilouriiiring, every thing being in a conftant Verdure 
or Flourish of Spring, that it look'd like a planted 
darden. 

I defcended a little on the Side of that delicious 
Vally, lurveying it with a fecret kind of Pleafure, 
( though rnixt with my other affti&ing Thoughts ) to 
think that this w^.s all my own, that 1 was King ar.d 
Lord of rUl this Country indeteafibly, and had a Right 
•of Poffeifijn; and ir amid convey it, 1 might have it 
in Inheritance, as compleatly as any Lord of a#M anor 
in England. I law here Abundance of Cocoa Trees, 
Orange, and Lemon, and Citron Trees ; but all wild, 
and few -bearing any Fruit, at lead, not then; How- 
ever, the green Limes that I gather'd, were not only 
pleaiant to tat, but very wholelbme ; and I mix'd their 
Juice afterwards with Water, which inade it very 
wholefome, and Very cool and refrefhing. 

1 found now I had Bufinefs enough to gather and 
carry Home ; and I refolved to lay up a Store, as well 
of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnilh my felf for 
the wet Se&fon, which I knew was approaching. 

In order to this, A gather'd a great Heap of Grapes m 
-one JPlace, an& a letter Heap in another Place, and a 
great -■ ar^el of Limes ard Lemons in another Place; 
and taking a few of each with me, I travelled home- 
ward, and rcf ;lved to come again, and bring a Bag or 
* Sack or what i could make, to carry the red Home. 
Accordingly, having fpent three Days in this jour* 
^ e y, F came Home ( io I niuft now call my Tent and 
my Cave J but before 1 got thither, the Grapes were 
fpoi IM, the Richn is of the Fruit and the Weight of the 
Juice having broken them, and bruifed them,. they were 
good for little or nothing ; as to the Limes, they, were 
.good, but ; could bnng but a few. T 

The ne*t nay h '.,■>.£ th*. 19th,. I; went back, hav- 
ing itiade m r.tw- f^ri'l Baggs to bring- Home my Har- 
well ; jBut 1 w*: : v ; prit'd, when coming to my" Heap 



( 96 ) 

ofGrapes, which were fo rich and fine when I gathered 
them, I found them all fpread abroad, trod to Pieces 
and dragg'd about, fome here, fome there, and Abun- 
dance eaten and devoured : »by this I concluded there 
were fome wild Creatures thereabouts, which had done 
this ; but what they were I knew not. 

However, as I found that there was no laying them 
up on Heaps, and no carrying them away in a Sack, but 
that one Way they would be deftroy'd, and the ojther 
Way they would be crufh'd with their own Weight, 
I took another Courfe ; for I gather'd a large Quantity 
of the Grapes, and hung them upon the Out-Branches 
of the Trees, that they might cure and dry in the Sun ; 
and as for the Limes and Lemons, I carry*d as many 
back as I could well ftand under. 

Wlfen I came Home from this Journey, I contem- 
plated with great Pleafure the Fruitfulnefs of that Val- 
ley, and the Pleafantnefs of the Situation, the Security 
from Storms on that Side the Water, and the Wood, 
and concluded that I had pitched upon a Place to fix my 
Abode, which was by far the worn: Part of the Coun- 
try. Upon the whole, I began to confider of removing 
my Habitation, and to look out for a Place equally fafe, 
as where I now was fituate, if poflible, in that pleafant 
fruitful Part of the Ifland. 

This Thought run long in my Head, and I was ex- 
ceeding fond of it for fome Time, the Pleafantnefs of the 
Place tempting me *, but when I came to a nearer View 
of it, and to confider that I was now by the Sea-fide, 
where it was at leaft poflible that fomething might hap- 
pen to my Advantage, and that the lame "ill Fate that 
Drought me hither, might bring fome other unhappj 
Wretches to the fame Place •, and tho* it was fcarce pro- 
bable that any fuch thing fhould ever happen, yet to en- 
clofe my felf among the Hills and Woods, in the Cen- 
ter of the Ifland, was to anticipate my Bondage, an<i 
to render fuch an Affair not only improvable, but im- 
poflible; and that therefore I ought not by any Means 
to remove. j 

However, I was To enamour'd of this Place, that 1 j 
fpent much of my Time there for the whole remaining 
Part of the Month ofjfofr; and tho" upon fecqw 

• ■ ' Thought* 



(97) 

Thoughts t refolv'd as above, not to remove,. yetlbuil£ 
me a little kind of a Bower, and furrounded it at a 
Diilance wtih a ftrong Fence, being a double Hedge, 
as high as I could reach, well flak'd and fill'd between 
with Brujhwocd ; and here I lay very fecure, fometimes 
two or three Nights together, always going over it with 
a Ladder, as berore ; ib that I tancy'd now 1 had my 
Country-Hcufe, and my Sea-Coail-Houle : And this 
Work took me up to the Beginning of Augutt* 

I had but newly finihYd my Fence, and began to en- 
joy my Labour, but the Rains came on, and made me 
iiick clofe to my firft Habitation ; for tho* I had made 
me aTenthke the other, with aPiece of aSail, and fpread 
it very well ; yet I bad not the Shelter of a Hill to keep 
me from Storms, nor a Cave behind me to retreat into, 
when the Rains were extraordinary. 

About the Beginning or' Augufi as I fa'td^ t had finifh'd 
my Bower, and began to enjoy my felf. The third of 
Augufi^ I found the Grapes I had hung up were perfectly 
dry'd, and indeed, were excellent good Raifins of the 
Sun ; fo I began to take them down from the Trees, 
and it was very happy that I did fo ; for the Rains 
which followed would have fpoiPd them, and I had loll 
the beil Part of . my Winter Food ; for I had above 
two hundred large Bunc les of them. No fooner had I 
taken them all down and carry'd moft of them Home 
to my Cave, but it began to rain; and from thence, 
which was the fourteenth o^ Augufl^ it rainM more or 
leis every Day, till the middle of Qftober^ and fome- 
times fo violently, that I could not ft ir out of my Cave 
for fever al Days. 

In this Sealbn I was much furpriz'd with the In- 
creafe of my Family : I had been concern'd for the Lois 
of one of my Cats, who run away from me, or as I 
thought had been dead, and I heard no more Tale or 
Tidings of her, till to my Aflonifliment Hie came home 
about the End of Aug 3 uft, with three Kittens. This 
was the more flrange to me, becaufe tho 5 I had kill'd 
a wild Cat, as I calFd it, with my Gun ; yet I thought 
it was a quite different Kind from our European C ats ; 
yet the young Cats were the fame kind of Houfe breed 
Hke t^ie old one j and both my Cats being Females, I 

F thought 



A 



"(9* ) 

thought it very ftrange : But from thefe three Cats, I 
^ iter wards came to be lb pefler'd with Cats, that I was 
♦forced to kill them like Vermin, or wild Beads, and to 
•drive them from my Houfe as much as poflibJe. 
* From the fourteenth of Augufl to the twenty fixtb, 
inceflant Rain, fo that I could not ftir, and was now ve- 
ry careful not to be much wet. In this Confinement 
1 began to be ftraitned for Food, but venturing out 
twice, I one Day kill'd a Goat; and the laft Day, which 
was the twenty-fixth found a very lai*ge Tortoife which 
Hvas a Treat to me, and my Food was regulated thus: 
Teat a Bunch of Raiiins for my Breakfaft, a Piece of 
the Goat's Fleih, or of the Turtle, for my Dinner 
broil'd •, ( for to my great Misfortune, I had no VefTel 
to boil or flew any thing) and two or three of the Tur- 
tle's Eggs for my Supper. 

During this Confinement in my Cover by the Rain, 
T work'd daily two or three Hours at enlarging my 
Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on towards one Side, 
till I came to the Outfide of the Hill, and made a Door 
or Way out, which came beyond my Fence or Wall, 
©nd fo I came in and out this Way : But I was not per- 
fectly eafy at lying fo open ; for as I had manag'd my~ 
felf before, I was in a perfeft Enclofure, whereas now 
1 thought I lay expos'd, and yet I could not perceive 
that there was any living thing to fear, the biggefl 
Creature that I had yet feen upon the Ifland being a 
Goat. 

September the thirtieth, I was now come to the un- 
happy Anniverfary of my Landing. I caft up the Not- 
ches on my Poft, and found I had been on Shore three 
hundred and fixty five Days. I kept this Day as a lo~ 
lemn faft, letting it apart to Religious Exercife, pro- 
ftrating my felf on the Ground with the mo(k ferious 
Humiliation, confeffing my Sins to God, acknowledg- 
ing his Righteous Judgments upon me, and praying to 
him to have Mercy on me, thro' Jefus Chrift ; and 
having not tailed the lead: Refrefliment for twelve 
Hours, even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat. 
a Bisket-Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went to Bed, 
iim/hing the Day as I began it. 

I had all this time obierv'd no Sabbath*Day ; for 

; .. ...... a$ 



( 99 ) 

■3s at firft I had no Senfe of Religion mpon myMind, and I 
had after ib me time omitted to diftinguiih the Weeks, 
by making a longer Notch than ordinary for the Sab- 
bath-Day, and ib did not really know what any cf the 
Days were } but now having call up the Days, as above, 
I found I had been there a \'ear *, ib I divided it into 
Weeks, and let apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath ; 
tho' I round at the End of my Account I had loft a Day 
or two in my Reckoning. 

A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and fo I 
contented my felf to ule it more fparingly, and to write 
down only the moft remarkable Events of my Life, with- 
out continuing a daily Memorandum of other Things. 

The rainy seaTon, and the dry Sea-Ton, be,gan now to 
appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide them fo t 
*is to provide for them accordingly. But I bought all 
iny Experience before I had it j and this I am going 
to relate, was one of the moft difcour aging Experi- 
ments that I made at all. I have mention'd that I had 
fav'd the few Ears of Barley and Rice which I had ib 
furprizingly found fpring up, as I thought, of them- 
felves., and believe there were about thirty Stalks of 
Rice and about twenty of Barly ; and now I thought it 
-a proper time to Tow it after the Rains, the Sun being in 
its Southern Polition going from me. 

Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground, as well as 
I could with my wooden Spade, and dividing it into 
two Parts, I fow'd my Grain ; but as I was lowing, 
it cafually occur'd to my Thoughts, that I would not 
Tow it all at firft, becaufe I did not know when was 
the proper time for it *, To I Tow'd about two thirds 
of the Seed, leaving about a Handful of each. 

It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that I did 
fo, for not one Grain of that I Tow'd this time came to 
any thing , for the dry Months following, the Earth ha- 
ving had no Rain after the Seed was lbwn, it had no 
Moifture to aifift its Growth, asd never came up at all, 
till the wet Seafon had come again, and then it grew as 
if it had been but newly Town. 

Binding my iirft Seed did not grow, which I easily 
imagin'd was by the Drought, I ibught for a moifter 
Piece of Ground to make another Trial in, and I dug 

V 2 Up 



( ioo ) 

up a Piece of Ground near my new Bower, and fow'd 
the reft: of my Seed in February, a little before the Ver- 
nal Equinox] and this having the- rainy Months of March 
and A$ril to water it, fprung up very pleafantly, and 
yielded a very good Crop • but having Part of the Seed 
left only, and not daring to fow all that I had yet, I 
had but a fmall Quantity at laft, my whole Crop not 
amounting to above hall a Peck of each kind. 

But by this Experiment I was made Mafler of my 
Bulinefs, and knew exaftly when the proper Seafon was 
to low ; and that I might exped two Seed-times, and 
two Harvefls every Year. 

While this Corn was growing, I made a little Difco- 
very, which was of Ufe to me afterwards: As foon as 
the Rains were over, and the Weather began to fettle, 
which was about the Month of November, I made a 
Vilit up the Country to my Bower, where tho' I had 
not been lome Months, yet I found all things juft as I 
left them. The Circle or double Hedge that I had 
made, was not only firm and entire, but the Stakes 
which I had cut off of fomeTrees that grew thereabouts, 
were all fliot out, and grown with long Branches, as 
much as a Willow.Tree ufually fhoots the £rft Year af- 
ter lopping its Head. I could not tell what Tree to 
call it, that thefe Stakes were cut from. I was fur- 
• priz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to fee the young 
Trees grow ; and I prun'd them, and led them up to 
grow as much alike as I could, and it is fcarce credible 
how beautiful a Figure they grew into in three Years ; 
to that tho* the Hedge made a Circle of about twenty 
Ave Yards in Diameter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might 
now call them, foon cover'd it ; and it was a compleat 
Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the dry Seafon. 

This made me refolve to cut fome more Stakes, and 
make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle round my 
Wall, I mean that of my iirft: Dwelling, which I did ; 
and placing the Trees or Stakes in a double Row, 
at about eight Yards diftance from my £rft Fence, they 

frew prefently, ar.d were at firft a fine Cover to my 
fabitation, and afterward ferv'd for a Defence alfq, as 
I fliall obierve in its Order. 



(IOI) 



I found now, that the Seafons of the Year might ge- 
nerally be divided, not into Summer and Winter, as in 
Europe ; but into the rainy Seafons, and the dry Seafons, 
which were generally thus:

Waif February J 

The rainy Seafon fometimes held longer or Ihorter, 
as the Winds happened to blow ; but this was the ge- 
neral Obfervation I made. After I had found, by Ex- 
perience, the ill Confequence of being abroad in the 
Rain, I took Care to furniili my felf with Provifions be- 
fore-hand, that I might not be oblig'd to go out •, and 
I fat within Doors as much as poifible during the wet 
Months. 

In this Time I found much Employment, (and very 
fuitable alfo to the Time,) for I found great Occafion 
of many things which I had no way to furnifh my 
felf with, but by hard Labour and conilant Applica- 
tion ; particularly, I tried many Ways to make my felt 
a Basket, but all the Twigs I could get for the Purpofe 
prov 4 d fo brittle, that they would do nothing. Tt 
prbv'd of excellent Advantage to me now, that when 
I was a Boy, I ufed to take great Delight in {landing at 
F 3 a 



( 102 ) 

* Basket- f»aier y s in the Town where my Father HvM r to 
lee them make their Wwher-ware \ and being, as Boys 
ufually are, very officious to help, and a great Ob- 
itrver of the Manner how they work'd thofe things, 
and ib me times lending a Hand, I had by this means 
full Knowledge of the Methods of it, that I wanted no- 
thing but the Materials*, when it came into my Mind, 
that the Twigs of that Tree from whence I cut my 
Stakes that grew, might poflibly be as tough as the 
Sallows, and Willows, and Qfiers in England, and I re- 
folv'd to try. 

Accordingly the next Day I went to my Country- 
Houfe, as 1 caird it, and cutting fome of the fmaller 
Twigs, I found them to my Purpofe as much as I could 
deiire; whereupon I came the next time prepar'd with 
a Hatchet to cut dcwn a Quantity, which I foon found, 
for there was great Plenty of them: Thefe I let up to 
dry within my Circle or Hedge, and when they were 
lit tor Ufe, I carried them to my Cave ; and here dur- 
ing the next Seafon, I employed my ielf in making, as 
well as I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry 
Ea¥th, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had occafion ; 
and tho' I did not firifh them very handfomely, yet I 
made them fufKciently ferviceable for my Purpofe ; and, 
thus afterwards I took Care never to be without them 5 
and as my Wicker-ware decayed, I made more, efpecially 
I made ftrong deep Baskets to place my Corn in, in- 
stead of Sacks, when I ihould come to have any Quan* 
tity of it. 

Having mafter'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a 
world of Time about it, I beftirrM my Ielf to fee, if pop 
fible, how to fupply two Wants. I had no VefTels to 
hold any thing that was Liquid, except two Runlets 
which were aimed; full of Rum, and fome Glafs Bottles, 
fome of the common Size, and others which were Cafe- 
Bottles fquare, for the holding of Waters, Spirits, £5V. 
I had not (o mu.?h as a Pot to boil any thing in, except a 
great Kettle which I fav'd out of the Ship, and which 
was too big for fuch Ufes as I deflr'd it for, i>^. to make 
Broth, and flew a Bit of Meat by it felf. The fecond 
Thing I woujd fain have had, was a Tobacco-Pipe 5 but 

it 



( io3 ) 

It was impoffiWe to me to make one \ however I found 
a Contrivance for that too at lail. 

I employed my felf in planting my fecond Rows of 
Stakes or Piles, and in this Wicker working all the Sum* 
mer, or dry Seafon, when another Butineis took me up 
more Time than it could be imagin'd I could fpare. 

I mentioned before, that I had a great Mind to fee 
the whole Ifland, and that I had travelled up the Brook, 
and fo on to where I built my Bower, and where I had 
an Opening quite to the Sea on the other Side of the 
Ifland. I now refblved to travel quite crofs to the Sea- 
fhore on Mia t Side: So taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and 
my Dog, and a large* Quantity of t J owder and Shot than 
ufual, with two Bisket- Cakes, and a great Bunch of 
Railins in my Pouch for my Store, I began my Jour- 
ney. When I had pafW the Vale where my Bower 
ftood, as above, I came within View of the Sea, to the 
Weft^ and it being a very clear Day, I fairly defcried 
Land, whether an Ifland or a Continent, 1 could nor 
tell ; but it lay very high, extending from the Weft to 
the W. S. W. at a very great Diftance \ by my Cutis it 
could not be lefs than filteen or twenty Leagues off. 

I could not tell what Part of the World this., might 
be, otherwife than that I knew it muft be Part of Ame- /■, 
rica\ and as I concluded by all my Obfervations, muil;^'~ 
be near the Spanij}) Dominions, and perhaps was all in- *'■ A 
habited by Savages, where if I fhould have landed, I f; 
had been in a worfe Condition than I was now ; and 
therefore I acquiefced in the Diipofltions of Providence, 
which I began now to- own, and to believe, order'd eve- 
ry thing for the beft •, I fay, I quieted my Mind with 
this, and left affli&ing my felt" with fruithlels Willies 
of being there, 

Befides, after Sortie Paufe upon this Affair, I confi- 
derM, that if this Land was the Spavijh Coaft, 1 fhould 
certainly, one Time or other, fee fome Vefiel pafs or 
re.pafs one W r ay or other; but if not, then it was the 
Savdge Coa(l between the Spanijh Country and Brafiis, 
which were indeed the word of Savages; for they are 
Cannibal, or Men-Eaters, and fail not to mui ther an 4 
«tevour all ths human Bodies that fall into their Hands.' 

4 H 4r With 



( T0 4 ) 

With thefe Confiderations I walk'd very leifurely 
forward. I found that Side of the Ifland where I now 
was, much pleafanter than mine, the open or Savanna 
Fields iweet, adorn'd with Flowers and Grafs, and full 
of very fine Woods. I iaw Abundance of Parrots, and 
fain I would have caught one, it poflible, to have kept 
it to be tame, and taught it to fpeak to me. I did, af- 
ttr fome Pains taking, catch a young Parrot, for I 
knock*d it down with a Stick, and having recover'd it, 
I brought it home ; but it was fome Years before I 
could make him fpeak : However, at laft I taught him 
to call me by my Name very familiarly: But 'the Ac- 
cident that tbllowU, tho' it be a Trifle, will be very 
diverting in its Place. 

I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey : I 
found in the low Grounds, Hares, as I thought them 
to be, and poxes, but they differed greatly from all the 
other Kinds I had met with; nor could 1 iatisfy my felf 
to eat them, tho' I kilfd feveral : But I had no need ta 
be venturous; for I had no Want of Food, and of that 
whkh was very good too; efpecially thefe three Sorts, 
viz* Goats, Pidgeons, and Turtle orTortoife; which, 
added to my Grapes, Leaden-Hall Market could not 
have furnifh'd a Table better than I, in Proportion ta 
the Company ; and tho* my Cafe was deplorable enough, 
yet I had great Caule for Thankfulnefs, that I was not 
driven to any Extremities for Food ; but rather Plenty, 
even to Dainties. ~* 

I never travelled in this Journey above two Miles 
outright in a Day, or thereabouts ; but I took {o many 
Turns and. Returns to fee what Difcoveries I could 
make, that I came weary enough to the Place where 
I refolv'd to fit down for all Night ; and then I either 
repcsM my felf in a Tree, or furfounded my felf with 
a Row of Stakes fet upright in the Ground, either from 
one Tree to another, or ib as no wild Creature could 
come at me, without waking me. 

As foon as I came to the Sea-Shore, I was furprixed 
to fee that I had taken up my Lot on the word Side of 
the Ifland ; for here indeed the Shore was cover'd with 
innumerable Turtles, whereas on the other Side 1 had 
found but three in a Year and half. Here wasalfo an 

infinite 



(xoy) 

infinite Number of Fowls of many Kinds, fonie of which 
I had not feen before, and many of them very good 
Meat ; but fuch as I knew not the Names o£ except 
thofe calVd Penguins. 

I could have fhot as many as I pleafed, but was very 
fparing of my Powder and Shot ; and therefore had 
more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I could, which I 
could better feed on : And tho 5 there were many Goats 
here more than on the other Side the Ifland, yet it was 
with much more Difficulty that I could come near 
them, the Country being flat and even, and they law 
me much fooner than when I was on the Hills. 

I confefs this Side of the Country was much plea- 
fanter than mine, but yet I had not the lead Inclination 
to remove ; for as I was fixed in my Habitation, it be- 
came natural to me, and I feem'd all the while I was 
here, to be as it were upon a Journey, and from Home; 
However, I traveled along the Shore of the Sea, to- 
wards the Eaft> I fuppofe about twelve Miles; and then 
letting up a great Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I 
concluded I would go Home again ; and that the next 
Journey I took, fhould be on the other Side of the Ifland, 
Eafl from my Dwelling, and (o round, till I came to my 
Pod again. Of which in its Place. 

I took another Way to come back than that I went^ 
thinking I could eafily keep all the Ifland Co much in 
my View, that I could not mils finding my firfl: Dwel- 
ling by viewing the Country ; but I found my felf mi'£ 
taken ; for being come about two or three Miles, I found 
my felf defcended into a very large Valley ; but fo fur- 
rounded with Hills, and thofe Hills covered with 
Woods, that I could not fee which was my Way by any 
Dire&ion but that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefs I 
knew very well the Pofltion of the Sun at that Time oi 
the Day. 

It happen'd, to my farther Misfortune, that the 
Weather prov'd haxey for three or four Days, while I 
was in this Valley; and not being able to fee the Sun, I 
wander'd about very uncomfortably, and at laft wa$ 
obliged to find out the Sea-Side, look for my Poll, anct 
comeback the fame Way I went; and then by eafy 
Journeys I turn*d homeward, the Wtathtr being ex* 
F 5 ceeding 



( io6 ) 

reeding hot, and my Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, mi. 
other Things very heavy, 

In this Journey my Dog furpriz'd a young Kid, and 
feiz'd upon it, and I running in to take hold of it, 
caught it, and Fav'd it alive from, the Dog.; I had a 
great Mind to bring it home ; if I could ->for I had often 
been mufing, whether it might not be pofEble to get 
a Kid or two, and Jo raife a Breed of tame Goats, which 
might iupply me when my Powder and Shot fhould be 
fpent. 

I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with a 
String which I made of fome Rope- Yarn which I al- 
ways carried about me, I led him along, tho' with fome 
Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, and there I enclos'd 
him, and left him \ for I was very impatient to be at 
Home, from whence I had been abfent above a Month. 

f cannot exprefs what a Satisfa&ion it was to me, to 
come into my old Hutch, and lie down in my Ham- 
mock-Bed : This little wandring Journey, without fet- 
tled Place of Abode, had been fo unpleafant to me, that 
my own Houfe, as I call'd it to my {elf, was a perfe& 
Settlement to me, compar'd to that ; and it render'd 
^very thing about me fo comfortable, that I refolv'd I 
would never go a great Way from it again, while it 
ftould be* my Lot to ft ay on the lfland. 

. I.repos'd my felf here a Week, to reft and regale my 
Ml after my long Journey ; during which, moft of the* 
Time was taken up in the weighty AlFair of making a 
Cage for my Polf, who began now to be a meer Do-* 
uiefHck, and to be mighty well acquainted with me* 
Then I began to think of the poor Kid, which I had 
pent in within my little Circle, and refolv'd to go and 
fetch it Home, or give it fome Food ; accordingly I 
•kent, and found it where I left it ; for indeed it could 
Bot get out, but was almoft ftarv'd for want of Food t 
J went and cut Boughs of Trees, and Branches ©f fuch 
Shrubs- as! could find, and threw it over, and having, 
^ed it, I ty'd it as I did before, to lead it away ; but it 
wasfo tame with, being, hungry, that I had no need to 
have ty'd it; for it follow'd me Eke a Dog;, and as I 
eontinually fed it, the Creature became fo loving, fo* 
lentil afid & fond, that it became from that time one 



( ">7 * 



ofiqy Do aicftieks alfo, and would neVer leave me af- 
terwards. 

The rainy Seafon of the Jkitumal Equinox was now, 
come, and I kept the ^oth of September in the lame fi- 
lemn manner as before, being the Anniverfary of my 
Landing on the Mland, having now been there two? 
Years, and no moreProfpeft of being deliver' d than the 
firft Day I came there. I fpent the whole Day in hum- 
ble and thankful Acknowledgments of the many won- 
derful Mercies which my folitary Condition was attend-- 
ed with, and without which it might have been infinite- 
ly more miferable. I gave humble and hearty Thanks 
that God had been pleaied to difcover to me, even that 
it was poffible I might be more happy in this folitary 
Condition, than I ihould have been in a Liberty of 
Society, and in all the Pleafures of the World. That- 
He could fully make up to me the Deficiences of my 
folitary State, and the wane of Human Society, by his 
Prefence, and the Communication of his Grace to my 
Soul, fupporting, comforting, and encouraging, me f ©< 
depend upon his Providence here, and hope for his 
Eternal Prefence hereafter. 

It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how much 
*nore happy the LiFe I now led was, with all its mifera- 
ble Circumftanees, than the wicked^ cur fed abominably 
Life I led all the pad Part of my Days > and now hav.r 
ing changed both my Sorrows and my Joys-; ,my very 
Deflres alter'd, my A rTe&iojns changed their Guifej and 
my Delights were perfe<Jfely new, from %vhat they 
were at iud coming, or indeed for tjie two Yeans 
part, 

Before, as I vvalk'd about, either on my Hunting, or 
for viewing the Country, the Angutthof my Soul at my 
Condition would break out upon me on a fudden, and' 
my very Heart would die withia me, to thitfKof th$ 
V> oods^ jtfeLe Mountains, the Df farts I was in; and ljovr 
1 was a Priioner lock'd up with the Eternal Barsatfi 
Bolts of the Qcean, |n an uninhabited Wild#rnef$v with- 
out Redemption. In the midft. of the .greateft. Conifer 
forqs-ot my Mind, tins would breakout upoir me like a 
<$torm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep Uke 
a Child, Sometimes it wculd take me in the Midijp- 



( io8 ), 

of my Work, and I would immediately fit down ani 
ilgb, and look upon the Ground for an Hour or two to- 
gether y and this w*s ftill worie to to me ; for if I could 
burU out into Tears, or vent my felr' by Words, it 
would go off; and the Grief having exhaufted it felf, 
would abate. 

But now I began to exercife my felf with new- 
Thoughts y I daily read the Word of God, and apply'd 
all the Comforts of it to my prefent State. One Morn- 
ing being very fad, I opened the Bible upon thefe Words, 
/ will never y never leave tbee> mr forfake thee ; immedi- 
ately it occur*d, that thefe Words were to me, why 
elfe ihould they be directed in fuch a^Manner, juft at 
the Moment when I was mourning over my Condition, 
as one for fa ken of God and Man ? Well then, faid I, 
if God does not forfake me, of what ill Confequence 
can it be, or what matters it, tho' the World fhould 
all forfake me ; feeing on the other Hand, if I had all 
the World, and fhould lofe the Favour and Blefling of 
God, there would be no Companion in the Lofs. 

From this Moment I began to conclude in my Mind, 
that it was poflible for me to be more happy in this for- 
faken, iblitary Condition, than it was probable I fhould 
have eVerbeen in any other particularState in theWorld; 
and with this Thought I was going to give Thanks 
io God for bringing me to this Place. 

I know not what it was, but fomething fliock*d my 
Mind at that Thought, and I durft notfpeak tke Words : 
£Iow canft thou be fuch an Hypocrite (faid I, even audi- 
bly,) to pretend to be thankful for a Condition, which 
however thou may'ft endeavour to - be contented with, 
thou wottldft rather pray heartily to be delivered from ; 
fo I ftopt there : But tho' I could not fay, I thank'd God 
for being there ; yet I fincerely gave Thanks to God 
for- opening my Eyes, by whatever affli&ing Providences^ 
to fee the former Condition of my Life, and to mourn 
for my Wicked nefs, and repent. I never open*d the 
•Bible or ihut it, by my very Soul within me blefs'd God 
iof dire&ing my Friend in England, without any Or- 
der of mine, to pack it up among my Goods; and for 
affiiling me afterwards to five it out of the Wireck of 
the Ship. 

Ttm% 



( I op ) 

Thus, and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began my 
third Year \ and tho' I have not given the Reader the 
Trouble of fo particular an Account of my Works this 
Year as the firtt ; yet in general it may be obferv'd, that 
I was very feldom idle \ but having regularly divided 
my Time according to the feveral daily Employments 
that were before me ; fuch as, Firfl, my Duty to God, 
and the reading Scriptures, which I conflantly kt aparc 
ibms time for, thrice every Day. Secondly, The going 
Abroad with my Gun for Food, which generally took 
me up three Hours in every Morning, when it did not 
Rain. Thirdly y The ordering, curing, preferving and 
cooking what I had kill'd or catch'd for my Supply ; 
thefe took up great Part of the Day : Alfo it is to be 
confidered, that the Middle of the Day when the Sun 
was in the Zenith, the Violence of the Heat was too 
great to ftir out •, fo that about four Hours in the Eve- 
ning was all the time I could be fuppofed to w r ork in ; 
with this Exception, that fometimes I changed myHours 
of Hunting and Working, and went to Work in the 
Morning, and Abroad with my Gun in the After- 
noon, 

To this fhort time allow'd for Labour, I defire may 
be added the exceeding Laborioufnefs of my Work, the 
many Hours which for want of Tools, want of Help, 
and want of Skill, every thing I did, took up out of my 
Time : Tor Example, I was full two and forty Days 
making me a Board for a long Shelfi which I wanted in 
my Cave ; whereas two Sawyers with their Tools, and 
Saw-Pit, would have cut fix of them out of the fame 
Tree in half a Day. 

My Cafe was this ; it was to be a large Tree which 
was to be cut down, becaufe rcy Board was to " be * 
broad one. This Tree I was three Days a cutting 
down, and two more cutting ofFthe Boughs, and reduc- 
ing it to a Log, or Piece of Timber. With inexpreifi- 
ble hacking and hewing I reduced both the Sides of it 
into Chips, till it begun to be light enough to move ; 
then I turn*d it, and made one Side of it fmooth, and 
fiat, as a Board from End to End ; then turning that 
iide downward, cut the other fide, till I brought the 
Flank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth on both 

Sides, 



(no ) 

Sides. Any one may judge the Labour of my Hands m 
fuch a Piece of Work ; but Labour and Patience carry'd 
me thro* that, and many other things : I only obferve 
this in particular, to fhew the Reaion why lb much of 
my Time went away with (o little Work, vi%* that 
what might be a little to be done with Help and Tools, 
was avail Labour, and recjuir'd a prodigious time to do 
alone, and by Hand. 

But notwithstanding this, with Patience and Labour 
I went thro 5 many things, and indeed every thing that 
my Circumfbmces mad« neceHary to me to do, as will 
appear by what follows. 

1 was now in the Months of November and December, 
expecting my Crop of Barley and Rice. The Ground 
I had manured or dug up for them was not great ; tor 
as I obferv'd, my Seed of each was not above the Quan- 
tity of half a Peck*, for I had loft one whole Crop by 
fowingin tlie dry Seafoa; but now my Crop promis'd 
very well, when ©n a fudden I found I was in Danger 
of lofmg it all again by Enemies of feveral Sorts, which 
it was fcarce poilible to keep from it *, as firft, the Goats, 
and wild Creatures which I call'd Hares, who tailing 
the Sweetnefs of the Blade, lay in it Night and Day, 
as ibon as it came- up, and eat it fo clofe, that it could 
get no time to fhoot up into Stalk. 

This I faw rao Remedy for, but by making an Enclo- 
{iire about it with a Hedge, which I did with a great 
deal of Toil • and the more, becaufe it requir'd a great 
deal of Speed ; the Creatures daily fpoiling my Corn, 
However, as my Arable Land was but final],, fuited to 
my Crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three 
Weeks time ; and fhooting fbmeof the Creatures in ths 
t>ay-time, I kt my Dog to guard it in the Night, ty- 
ing him up.to a Stake at the Gate, \vherehe would (land 
and bark all Night long ; fo in a little time the Enemies 
fprfook the ; Place, -and the Corn grew very fkong and 
$yelJ, and began to ripen apace. , . 

But a&'the Beads ruined me before, while my Corn 
wa| in the Blade, fo the Birds were as likely to ruin 
me now, when it w&sin the Ear ; for going along by 
the Place to fee how it throve, I faw my little Crop 
|urrounde<l,with; FowJ* *& I ifenow, not Jipw many 



( III ) 

Sorts, who flood as it were watching 'till rfhouH Be- 
gone. I immediately let fly among them (for I always 
had my Gun with me.) 1 had no (boner (hot, but there 
role up a little Cloud of Fowls, which I had not feen 
at all, from among the Corn it felf. 

This touch'd me fenfibly, for I forefaw, that in a. 
few Days they would devour all my Hopes, that I 
fhould beilarv'd, and never be able to raile a Crop 
at all, and what to do I could not tell : However, Ire- 
folv'd not to loie my Corn, if poffible, tho' I fhould 
watch it Night and Day, In the firft Place, I went a- 
niong it to lee what Damage was already done, and 
found they had fpoiPd a good deal of it ; but that as it 
was yet too green for them, the lofs was pot fo great, 
but that the remainder was like to be a good Crop if 
it could be fav'd. 

I (laid by it to load my Gun, and then coming away 
I could eafily fee the Thieves iltting upon all the Trees 
about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away, 
and the Event proved it to be fo ; for as I walk'd off as 
if I was gone, I was no (boner out of their Sight, but 
they dropt down one by one into the Corn again. I 
was fo provok'd, that I could not h a ve^ P atience today 
till more came on, knowing that j^pili^^ghat they 
eat now, was, as it wight be fag ' ' 
in the Confequence ; but comingL^^ 
fired again, and kilfd three of themt " : < 
wilh'd tor ; Co I took them up, and ferv'oTYhem is" 
fcrve notorious Thieves in England, ( vi\ ) Hanged 
them in Chains for a Terror to others. It is impoflihle 
to imagine almoft, that this (hould have fuch an EfFei5k 
as it had ; for the Fowls would nGt only not come at 
the Corn, but in fliort they foribok all that Part of the 
Ifland, and I could never fee a Bird near the Place as^ 
long as my Scare-Crows hung there. 

This I was very glad of, you, may be fure; and about 
the latter End of December > which was our feeond Ha»» 
veft of the Year, I reaped my Crop. 

I was fad ly put to it for a Scythe or. a Sickle to cut 
k down, and all I could do was no make one as well 
as I could out of ore of the broad Swords or Cutlafles* 
which Ifav'd among the Arras out of the .Ship. How«* 




( m ) 

ever, as my firft Crop was but fmall, I had no great 
Difficulty to cut itfdown: In fhort, I reap'd it my 
way, for I cut nothing off but the Ears, and carry'd it 
away in a great Basket which I had made, and (6 ruhb'd 
it out with my Hands : And at the End of all my Har- 
veiling, I found that out of my half Peck of Seed, I had 
near two Bufhels of Rice, and above two Bufhels and a 
half of Barley, that is to fay t by my Guefs, for I had no 
Meafure at that time." 

However, this was a great Encouragement to me ; 
and I forefaw that in time, it would pleafe God to flip- 
ply me with Bread : And yet here I was perplex'd a- 
gain, for I neither knew how to grind or make Meal of 
my Corn, or indeed how to clean it and part it ; nor 
if made into Meal, how to make Bread of it ) and if 
how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. Thefe 
things being added to my Defire of having a good 
Quantity for Store, and to fecure a conftant Supply, I 
reiolv'd not to tafteany of this Crop, but to preferve it 
all for Seed againft the next Seafon, and in the mean time 
to employ all my Study and Hours of working to ac- 
complifh this great Work of providing my felf with Corn 
and Bre~ ^ , | # || 

_ It ^l^ttlSKKB^M^f that now I work'd for my 

~ * derful, and what I believe few 

^ eh upon, (vi%.) the Itrange Mul- 

thingf necefTar* in the Providing,Prcduc- 

J7 CuringTbreffing, Making and Finilhing this one 
Article of Bread. 

I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature, found 
this to be my daily Difccuragement, and was made 
more and more fenflble of it every Hour, even after 
I got the £rft handful of Seed-Corn, which, as I 
havefaid, came up unexpe&edly, and indeed to a Sur- 
prize. 

Firft, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no Spade 
or Shovel to dig iu Well this I conquet'd, by making 
a wooden Spade, as I obferved before \ but this did my 
Work but in a wooden Manner ; and tbo* it coll me a 
great many Days to make it, yet for want of Iron it not 
only wore out the fooner, but made my Work the har- 
der, arid made it be perform' d much worie, 

How* 




( »3 ) 

Ho wever, this I bore with too, and wascontent to work 
it out with Patience, ajad bear with the Badnefs of the 
Performance. When the Corn was fow'd, I had no 
Harrow, but was forced to go over it my ielr^ and drag a 
great heavy Bough of ii Tree over it, to 1 cratch the Earth 
as it may be calf d, rather than Rake or Harrow it. 

W hen it was growing and grown, 1 have obferv'd al- 
ready how many things i wanted, to fence it, fecure it t 
mow or reap it, cure and xjarry it Home, thrafh, part 
it from the Chaff, and lave it. Then I wanted a Mill 
to grind it, Sieves to drefs it y Yeaft and Salt to make it 
into Bread, and an Oven to bake it j and all theie 
things I did without, as fhtril be ohferved ; and yet 
the Corn was an ineftimable Comfort and Advantage to 
me too. But all this as I laid, made every thing laborious 
and tedious to me, but that there was no Help for ; nei- 
ther was my time fo much Lofs to me, becaufei had 
divided it, a certain Part of it was every Day appoint* 
ed to theie Works; and as I refolrd to uie none of the 
Corn for Bread till i had a greater Quantity by me, I 
had the next fix Months to apply my felf wholly by La- 
bour and Invention to furniih my felf with U tenuis 
proper for the performing all the Operations neceffary 
for the making the Corn (when T jlfti^** ^ ^ my 
Ufe. . 

But fir ft, I was to prepare morl 
Scod enough to low above an Acr 
I did this, i had a Week's Work at leaft] 
Spade, which when it was done, was but a forry one 
indeed, and very heavy, and requir'd double Labour to 
work with it ; however I went thro* that, and fow'd 
niy Seed in two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near 
my Houfe as I could find them to my Mind, and fene'd 
them in with a good Hedge, the -Stakes of which were 
all cut of that Wood which I had fet before, which I 
knew would grow, fo that in one Year's time I knew I 
fhould have a Quick or Living Hedge, that would want 
but little Repair. This work was not fo little as to 
take me up lefs than three Months, becaufe great Part 
of that time was of the wet Seafon, when I could not 
go abroad.

not go out, I found Employment on th® following Oc- 
casions, always obferving, that all the while I was at 
Work, I diverted my felf with talking to my Parrot, 
and teaching him to Speak ; and I quickly learned him 
to know his own Name, and at lad to fpeak it out 
pretty loud, POL L, which was the firft Word I ever 
beard fpokeirin the Ifknd by any Mouth but my own. 
This therefore was not my Work, but an Aifiitant to 
my Work * f for now, as I faid, I had a great Employment 
upon my Hanfi% as follows, (vi%*) I had long ftudy*d, by 
fome Mieans or other, to make my felf fom* EarthenVei* 
&ls, which indeed I wanted forely, but knew not where 
to come at them : However, confidering the Heat of the 
Climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any 
fush Clay, I might botch up fome fueh Pot, as might, 
being dry'd in the Sun, be hard enough, and ftrong 
enough to bear handling, and to hold any Thing that 
was dry, and required to be kept fo ; and as this was 
neceflary in the preparing Corn, Meal, Gfr. which was 
the Thing I was upon, I refolved to make fome as large 
as I could, and fit only to (tend like Jars to hold what 
ihould be put into them, 

'* wnn1r * IFifcfi jk p & ea ^ er pity m ^9 or rather laugh 

atji^pBpPSwwyiy aukward Ways I took to raife 
$^ ; $i4iat„ cdWmiihaperj ugly Things I made, 
w --IffiBE^ th&m Ml in, and how many fell out, the 
*0g ftih? enough to bear its own Weight*, 
bow many crack' d by the over violent Heat of theSu% 
being let out too hafHly ; and how many fell in Pieces 
with only removing, >as well before as after they were 
dry'd; and in a Word, how after having, laboured hard 
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it 
home and work it, I could not make above two larg£ 
Earthen ugly thingSj I cannot call them Jars, in about 
two Months Labour. 

However, as the Sun baked tbefe two very dry and 
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fet them down 
again in two great Wicker-Baskets, which I had made 
en purpofe for them, that they might not break ; and 
as between the Pot and the Basket there was^a Jiltler 

roomy 



( III ) 

room to fpare, I ftufPd it full of the Rice and Barfej? 
Straw, and thefe two Pots being to (land always dry, £ 
thought would hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the 
Meal when the Corn was bruited. 

Tho' I mifcarried fo much in my Deflgn for large 
Pots, yet I made feveral fmaller things with better Sue* 
cefs j fuch as little round Pots, flat Difhes, Pitchers* 
and Pipkins, and any thing my Hand turn'd to, and 
the Heat of the Sun bak'd them ftranp/ly hard. 

But all this would not anfwer my End, which was 
to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Liquid, and 
bear the Fire, which none of thefe could do. It hap- 
pen'd after fome time, making a pretty large Fire for 
cooking my Meat, when I went to put it out after I 
had done with it, I found a broken Fiete of one of my 
Earthen- ware VefTels in the Fire, burnt as hard as a 
Stone, and red as a Tile. I was agreeably furpriz'd to 
fee it, and (aid to my {elf, that certainly they might 
be made to burn whole, if they would burn bro- 
ken. 

This fct me to ftudying how to order my Fire, fo as 
to make it burn me fome Pots. I had no Notion of a 
Kiln, fuch as the Potters burn in, or of glazing them 
with Lead, tho 5 1 had fome Lead to doit with ; but I 
plac'd three large Pipkins, and two or three Pots in a 
Pile one upon another, and plac'd my Fire-wood all 
round it with a great Heap of Embers under them ; 
I ply'd the Fire with freih Fuel round the Outfide, and 
upon the Top, till I faw the Pots in the Infide red hot 
quite thro', and obferved that they did not crack at all ; 
when I faw them clear red, I let them ftand in that 
Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one of them, tho* 
it did not crack, did melt or run, for the Sand which 
was mix'd with the Clay melted by the Violence of the* 
Heat, and would have run into Glafr if I had gone on ; 
ft) I flack'd my Fire gradually, till the Pots began to a- 
bate of the red Colour, and watching them all Night* 
that I might not let the Fire abate to faft, in the Morn- 
mg I had three very good, I will not fay handlbme Pip- 
kins, and two other Earthen Pots, % as hard burnt as 
could be deiir'd ; and one of them perfe&ly glax'cl 
with the Running of the Sand* 



( IIS) 

After this Experiment, I need not fay that I wanted 
no fort of Earthen Ware for my life; but I muft needs 
fay, as to the Shapes of them, they were very indiffe- 
rent, as any one may fuppofe, when I had no Way of 
making them, but as the Children make Dirt-Pies, or as 
a Woman would make Pies that never learnt to raife 
Pafte. 

No Joy at a Thing of fo mean a Nature was ever 
equal to mine, when I found I had made an Earthen 
Pot that would bear the Fire ; and I had hardly Pa- 
tience to ftay till they were cold, before I fet one upon 
the Fire again, with fome Water in it, to boil me {orris 
Meat, which I did admirably well; and with a < Piece 
of a Kid I made fome very good Broth, tho 5 I wanted 
Oatmeal, and feveral other ingredients requisite to make 
it fo good as I would have had it been. 

My next Concern was, to get me a Stone-Mortar 
to ftamp or beat fome Corn in ; for as to the Mill, there 
was no Thought at arriving to that Perfe&ion of Art, 
with one Pair of Hands. To fupply this Want I was 
at a great Lofs ; for of all Trades in the World I was as 
perfectly unqualified for a Stone- Cutter, as for any 
whatever; neither had I any Tools to go about it with. 
I fpent many a Day to find out a great Stone big enough 
to cut hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could 
find none at all, except what was in the folid Rock, and 
which I had no Way to dig or cut out; nor indeed 
were the Rocks in the Hland of Hardnefs lufficient, but 
were all oF a fandy crumbling Stone, which would nei- 
ther bear the Weight of a heavy Peflle, or would break 
the Corn without filling it with Sand : So after a great 
deal of Time loll: in fearching for a Stone, I gave it 
over, and refolv'd too look out a great Block of hard 
Wood, which \ found indeed much eafier ; and getting 
one as big as I had Strength to ftir, I rounded it, and 
form'd it on the Outlide with my Axe and Hatchet, and 
then with the Help of Fire and infinite Labour, made 
a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in Brafil make their 
Canws. After this, I made a great heavy Peftle or 
Beater, of the W r ood calFd the Iron- Wood, and this I 
prepared and laid by againft I had my next Crop of 

Com, 



("7) 

Corn, when I propos'd to my felf to grind, or rather 
pound my Corn into Meal to make my Bread. 

My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or Searfe, to 
drefs my Meal, and to part it from the Bran and the 
Husk, without w r hich I did not fee it poflible I could 
have any Bread. This was a mod difficult Thing, lb 
much as but to think on ; for to be fure I had nothing 
like the necejQTary Thing to make it with ; I mean fine 
thin Canvas, or Stuff to fearch the Meal through. And 
here I was at a full Stop for many Months ; nor did I 
really know what to do ; Linnen I had none left, but 
what was meer Rags *, I had Goats Hair, but neither 
knew I how to weave it or fpin it; and had I known 
how, here was no Tools to' work it with; all the Re- 
medy that I found for this, was, That at lad: I did re- 
member I had among the Seamens Cloaths which were 
fav'd out of the Ship, IbmeNeckcloaths of Callicoe or 
Muflin; and with fome Pieces of thefe I made three 
fmall Sieves, but proper enough for the Work; and thus 
I made lhift for fome Years ; how I did afterwards, I 
{hall fhew in its Place. 

The baking Part was the next thing to be confider'd, 
anof fisjiv I Ihould make Bread when I came to have 
Corn ; for firft I had no Yeafl : As to that Part, as 
there was no fupplying the Want, fo I did not concern 
nryfelf much about it: But for an Oven, I was indeed 
in great Pain. At length I found out an Experiment 
for that alio, which was this ; I made fome Earthen 
Veffels very broad, but not deep ; that is to fay, about 
two Foot Diameter, and not above nine Inches deep ; 
thefe I burnt in the Fire, as I had done the other, and 
laid them by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a 
great Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav'd with 
ibme fquare Tiles of my own making and burning alfo- 
but 1 fhould not call them fquare. 

When the Fire. wood was burnt pretty much into 
Embers, or live Coals, I drew them forward upon this 
Hearth, fb as to cover it all over, and there I let them 
tye, till the Hearth was very hot ; then fweeping away 
all the Embers, I fet down my Loaf, or Loaves, and 
whelming down the Earthen Pot upon them, drew the 
Embers all round the Outiide of the Pot, to keep in, 

and 



( I* ) 

£n<l add to the Heat ; and thus, as well as In the Left 
Oven in the World, I bak'd my Barley-Loaves, and be- 
came in little time a meer Paflry-Cook into the- Bar- 
gain ; for I made my felf feveral Cakes of the Rice, and 
buddings; indeed 1 made no Pies, neither had I any 
thing to put into them, fuppofmg I had, except the 
Flefh either of Fowls or Goats. 

It need not be wondered at, if all thefe things took 
me up rnoft Part of the third Year of my Aboad here ; 
for it is to be obferv'd, that in the Intervals of thefe 
Things, I had my new Harvefl: and Husbandry to ma- 
nage ; for I reap'd my Corn in its Seafon, and carried it 
Home as well as I could, and laid it up in the Ear, in 
my large Baskets, till I had Time to rao it out; for I 
had no Floor to thrafli it on, or Inftrument to thrafh it 
with. 

And now indeed my Stock of Corn encreafing, I 
really wanted to build my Barns bigger : I wanted a 
Place to lay it up in; for the Increafe of the Corn now 
yielded me fo much, that I had of the Barley about 
twenty Bufhels, and of the Rice as much, or more ; in- 
femtteh, that now I refolved to begin to ufe it^frgely, 
for my Bread had been quite gone a great whilaj^^' r 
refolved to fee what Quantity would be ^$JMfc 
«ne a whole Year, and to fow but once a Year. ^ El 

Opon the whole, I found that the forty Bufhels of 
BaHey and Rice was much more than I could con fume 
in a Year ; £o I refolved to fow jufl the fame Quantity 
■every Year that I fbw'd the lafl, in hopes that fuch a 
■Quantity would fully provide me with Bread, &c. 

All the while thefe things were doing, you may be 
Cure my Thoughts run many times upon the Profpe& of 
Land which 1 had feen from the other Side of the 
I (land, and I was not without fecret Wiihes that I was 
on Shore there, fancying that feeing the main Land, and 
an inhabited Country, I might find fome Way or other 
to convey my felf farther, and perhaps at lafl findfonae 
Means of Efcape. 

But all this while I made no Allowance for the Dan- ? 
gers of fuch a Condition , and how I mi^ht fall into the i 
Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch as I might have 
Reafon to think far worfe than the Lions and Tigers of 

jfrica. 



( **9 ) 

Africa. Tba*t if I once came into their Power, I fhoull 
run a Hazard more than a thoufand to one of being 
kiiJ'd, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard, 
that the People of the Carrifaan Goads were Cannibals, 
or Men-eaters *, and L knew by the Latitude, that I could 
not be far oh? from that Shore. That fuppofe they were 
not Cannibals, yet that they might kill me, as many 
Europeans who had fallen into their Hand had been fer- 
ved, even when they had been ten or twenty together ; 
much more I that- was but one, and could make little 
or no Defence. All theie things, I fay, which I ought 
to have confjder'd well of, and I did caft up in my 
Thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of my Appre- 
henlions at firft ; and my Head run mightily upon the 
Thoughts of getting over to that Shore. 

Now I wiih'd for my Boy Xury, and the Long-Boat 
with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail, with which 1 fail'd. 
above a Thouland Miles on the Coafl of Afrkk ; but 
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and look 
on our Ship's Boat, which, as I have laid, was blown 
up upon the Shore a great Way in the Storm, when we 
were firil cail away. She lay almolt where flie did at 
•fy^Jikut not quite ; and was turn'd by the forct- of the 
. : d^Bjj^^i^^irids^lmofl Bottom upwa: i, ^ ; nft 

If I had had Hands to have re*fitteci her, and to have 
launch'd her into the Water, the Boat would have dJne 
well enough, and I might have gone back into thoJPrj^ 
fih with her eaiily enough ; but L might have^eafily ?oN^? 
feen, that I could no more turn her, and fe,t her up*^ 
right upon her Bottom, than I could remove the Illand. 
However, I went to the W 7 ood and cut Levers and Roi- 
lers> and brought them to the Boat, reiblv'd to try 
what I could do ; fuggefting to my felf] that if I could 
hut turn her down, I might eailly repair the Damage 
ihe had received, and fhe would be a very good Boat, 
and I might go to Sea in her very eafily. 

I fpared no Pains indeed in this Pieee of fruitlels 
Toil, and fpent, I think, three or four Weeks about - 
it ; at lad finding it impofuble to heave it up with my 
Kttle Strength, I fell to*digging away the Sand to un- 
dermine 



( iao ) 

^ermine it, and fo to make it fall down, fetting Pieces 
of Wood to thruft and guide it right in the Fall. 

But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it up 
again, or to get under it, much lels to move it forwards 
towards the Water ; fo I was forc'd to give it over ; 
and yet, tho* I gave over the Hopes of the Boat, my 
Defire to venture over for the Main increafed, rather 
than decreafed, as the Means for it feem'd impoiTible. 

This at length put me upon thinking, whether it was 
not poffible to make my felfaCrf^e or Periagua y Siish as 
the Natives of thofe Climates make, even without Tools, 
or, as I might fay, without Hands, vi\. of the Trunk 
of a great Tree. This I not only thought poflible, but 
eafy, and pleas' d my felf extreamly with the Thoughts 
of making it, and with my having much more Conve- 
nience for it than any of the Negroes or Indians ; hut not 
at all confidering the particular Inconveniences which I 
lay under, more than the Indians did, vi%. Want of 
Hands to move it into the Water, when it was made ; 
a Difficulty much harder for me to furmount, than all 
the Confequences of Want of Tools could be to them : 
For what was it to me, that when I had chofen a jail 
Tree in the Woods, I might with great Trouble cut it 
down, if after I might be able with m^Took to hew 
attd dub the Outfide i nt0 ljfcltoj£ Shape &k a Boat, and 
burn or cut out the Infi^^^Pfflj&it hollow, fo to make 
a Boat of it, if after all this, I mufl leave it iuft there 
where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the 
Water. 

One would have thought, I could not have had the 
*%afl Reflexion upon my Mind of my Circumflance, 
while I was making this Boat, but I mould have im- 
mediately thought fiow I mould get it into the Sea ; 
but my Thoughts were fo intent upon my Voyage over 
the Sea in it, that I never once eonfider'd how 1 
ihould get it off of the Land ; and it was really in its 
own Nature more eafy for me to guide it over forty five 
Miles of Sea, than about Forty five Fathom of Land, 
where it lay, to fet it a -float in the Water. 

I went to work upon this Boat the moil like a Fool 
that ever Man did, who had any of his Senfes awake. 
I pleas'd my felf with the Defign, without determin- 
ing 



( »I ) 

ing whether t was ever able to undertake it J not hut 
that the Difficulty of launching my Boat came often 
into my Head \ but I put a flop to my own Enquiries 
into it, by this fooliih Anfwer which I gave my ielfi 
Zetme$r]l make it, TU warrant PUfindfome Way or other 
to get it along, when 'tis done* 

This was a mod prepofterous Method ; but the Ea- 
gernefs of my Fancy prevail'd, and to work I went, and 
fell'd a Cedar-Tree: 1 queftion much whether Solomon 
ever had fuch a one for the Building the Temple at 
Jerusalem \ It was Ave Foot ten Inches Diameter at 
the lower Part next the Stump, and four Foot eleven 
Inches Diameter at the End of twenty two Foot, after 
which it leiTen'd for a while, and then parted into 
Branches : It was not without infinite Labour that I 
felT'd this Tree : I was twenty Days hacking and hew- 
ing at it at the Bottom \ I was fourteen more getting 
the Branches and Limbs, and the vaft fpreading Head 
of it cut off, which I hack'd and hew'd through with 
Axe and Hatchet, and inexpreffible Labour : After this, 
it coft me a Month to fliape it, and dub it to a Pro- 
portion, and to fomething like the Bottom of a Boat, 
that it might fwim upright as it ought to do. It coft 
me near three Months more to clear the Infide, and 
Work itj>ut4b, as to make an exa& Boat of it: This! 
did indeed without Fift^x mere Mallet and Chiffel, 
and by the dint of hard Lanbir, till I had brought it 
to be a yery handfome Periagua, and big enough to 
have carried fix and twenty Men, and confequently big 
enough to have carried me and all my Cargo^ 

W hen I had gone through this Work, Fwas extreme- 
ly delighted with it .• The Boat was really much big- 
ger than I ever faw a Canoe, or Periagua, that was made 
of one Tree, in my Life 4 Many a weary Stroke it had 
coft, you may be fure, for there remained nothing but 
to get it into the Water ; and had I gotten it into the 
Water, I make no queftion, but I fhould have began 
the maddeft Voyage and the mo(k unlikely to be per- 
form'd, that ever was undertaken. 

But all my Devices to get it into the Water faiPd me, 

. though they coft me infinite Labour too ; It lay about 

one hundred Yards from the Water, and not more, bat 

G the 



{ 111 ) 

•flie firft Inconvenience was, it was up Hill towards the 
Creek : Well, to take away this Difcouragement, I re- 
folv'd to dig into the Surface of the Earth, and fo make 
a Declivity : This I begun, and it cq& me a prodigious 
deal of Pains •, But who grudges Pains, that have their 
Deliverance in View? But when this was worked 
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was ftill much 
at one ; far I could no more flblr the Canoe than I could 
the other Boat. 

Then Im&ifur'd theDiffiance ofGraund,andrefolv'd 
to cut a Dock, or Canal, to bring the Water up to the 
Canoe> Teeing I could not bring the Canoe down to the 
Water; Well, I began this Work, and when I began to 
enter into it, and calculated how deep it was to be dug, 
how broad, how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, 
that by the Number of Hands I had, feeing none but my 
«own, it muft have been ten or twelve Years before I 
ihould have gone through with it ; for the Shore lay 
high, fo that at the upper End it mud have been at lead: 
twenty Foot deep ; to at length, tho' with great Re- 
ludancy, I gave this Attempt over alio. 

This griev'd me heartily, and now I faw, fcho' too 
late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we*count the 
Coft, and before we judge rightly of our own Strength 



to go through with it- % 

Year in this Place, and kq)t my Anniverfary with the 



In the middle of this W<m y I finlfhM my fourth 



fame Devotion, and with as much Comfort as ever be- 
fore; for by a conftant Study, and ferious Application 
.of the Word of God, and by the Affiftance of his 
43race, I gain'd a different Knowledge from what I had 
before : i entertain'd different Notions of things ; 1 
look'd now upon the World as a thing remote, which I 
had nothing to do with, no Expe&ation from, and ifl* 
deed no Defires about ; In a Word, I had nothing in- 
deed to do with R, nor was ever like to have; fo I 
thought it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it here- 
after, vi%. as a Place I had lived in, but was come out 
of it ; and well might I fay, as Father Abraham to Dives 9 
Between me and thee is agreaK Gulpb fixed. 

In the firft Plaee, I was removed from all the Wic- 
kednefs of the World here; I had neither the Zufi of the 



i m ) . 

fflefi, the £jft oftlm Mye> or the Pride of Life* I Mi 
nothing to covet; for I had all that I was now capable 
of enjoying : I was Lord of the whole Manor, or if I 
pleas'd I might call my felf King, or Emperor over the 
Whole Country which I had PoSctfion oi : There were 
mo Rivals: I had no Competitor, n^ne to difpute So- 
vereignty or Command with me ; I might have rais'd 
Ship-Loadings of Corn, bat I had no UCe for it; £o I 
let as little grow as I thought enough for my Occafion; 
I had Tortoife or Turtles enough ; but now and then 
one was as much as I could put to any Uie ,• I had 
Timber enough to have built a Fleet of Ships: I had 
Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to have cur'd 
into Raifins, to have loaded that Fleet when they had 
been built. 

But all! could makeUfe of^ was AH that was va- 
luable : I had enough to eat, and to fupply my Wants, 
and what was all the reft to me ? If I kilPd more Fkfii 
than I could eat, the Dog rauft eat it, or the Vermin ; 
if I fow'd more Corn than I could eat, it mull bcfpoil'd? 
The Trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the 
Ground, I could make no more Uie of them than for 
Fewel, and that I had no Occafion for, but to drefs my 
Food. _/ 

In- a^ Word, the Nature and Experience of Things 
di&ated to me upon juft Reflexion, that all the good 
Things of this World, are no farther good to us, than 
they are for our Ufe ; and that whatever we may heap 
*ip indeed to give others, we enjoy as much as we can 
tife, and no more. The mok covetous griping 1 Miler 
in the World would have been cured of the Vice of Co- 
vetoufnefs, if he had been in my Cafe; for I poffefled 
infinitely more than I knew what to do with. I had no 
room for Defire, except it was of things which I had 
not, and they were but Trifles, tho' indeed of great Uie 
to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Parcel of Money, 
as well Gold as Silver, above thirty fix Pounds Sterling: 
Alas! there the nafty ferry afelefe Stuff lay ; I had no 
manner of Bufinefe for it ; and I often thought with my 
felf, that I would haye given a Handful of it for a Grofe 
of Tobacco-Pipes, or for a Hand-Mill to grind my Corn; 
*&y> I would have given it all for Sixpenny-worth of 
Q 2 Turw0 



( ™4 ) 

Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or for a Handful 
ofPeafe m& Beans, and a Bottle of Ink : .A *7 nw, I 
had not the lead Advantage by it, or Benefit from it $ 
but there it lay in a Drawer, and grew mouldy with 
the Damp of the Cave, in the wet Seafon; and if I had 
had the Drawer full of Diamonds, it had been the fame 
Cafe; and they had been of no manner of Value to me, 
becaufe of no Uk. 

I had now brought my State of Life to be much eafier 
in it lelf than it was at firft, and much eafier to my 
Mind, as well as to my Body : I frequently fat do\fn 
to my Meat with Thankfulnefs, and admired the Hand 
of God's Providence, which had thus fpread my Table 
in the Wildernefs : I learned to looks more upon the 
bright Side of my Condition, and lefs upon the dark 
Side ; and to confider what I enjoy'd, rather than what 
I wanted ; and this gave me fonietimes fuch fecret Com- 
forts, that I cannot exprefs them ; and which I take 
Notice of here, to put thole difcontented People in 
Mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God 
has given them, becaufe they fee and covet fomething 
that he has not given them .* All our Dilcontents about 
what we want, appeared to me to fpring from theWant 
of Thankfulnefs for what we have, l,_^ 

Another Reflexion was of great Ufe to me, amfc-doubt- 
lefs would he fo to any one that fhould fall into fuch 
Diftrefs as mine was •, and this was to compare my pre- 
fent Condition with what I at firft expe&ed it fhould 
be ; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if 
the good Providence of God had not wonderfully or- 
der 'd the Ship to be caft up nearer to the Shore, where 
I not only could come at her, but could bring what I 
got out of her to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort ; 
without which, I had wanted Tools to work, Wea- 
pons for Defence, ox Gun-powder and Shot for getting 
my Food. 

I fpent whole Hours, I may fay whole Days, in re- 
yrefenting to my felf in the moft lively Colours, how I 
amid have a&ed, if I had got nothing out of the Ship ; 
how I could not have fo much as got any Food, except 
Fifh and Turtles; and that as it was long before I found 
any of them, I mud have peri&'d firft : That I fhould 

have 



( 1»5 ) 

Save Kv'd, if I had not perifh'd, like a meer Savage % 
That if I had kill'd a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Con- 
trivance, I had no way to flea or open them, or part 
the Flelh from the Skin and the Bowels, or to cut it 
up \ but muft gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with 
my Claws like a Beaft. 

Thefe Reflexions made me very fenfible of the Good- 
nefs of Providence to me, and very thankful for my 
prefent Condition, with all its Hardihips and Misfor- 
tunes: And this Part alfo I cannot but recommend to 
the Reflection of thofe who are apt in their Mifery to 
fay, Js any jjffli&iontike mint ? Let them confider, how 
much worfe the Cafes of feme People are, and what their 
Cafe might have been, if Providence had thought fit. 

I had another Reflexion which aflifted me alfo to 
comfort my Mind with Hopes ; and this was compar- 
ing my prefent Condition with what I had deferv'd, and 
had therefore Reafon to expe& from the Hand of Pro- 
vidence : I had liv'd a dreadful Life, perfectly deftitute 
of the Knowledge and Fear of God ; I had been well 
inftru&ed by Father and Mother ; neither had they been 
wanting to me in their early Endeavours, to infufe a 
religious Awe of God into my Mind, a Senfe of my 
Duty, and of what the Nature and End of my Being 
reqmr'd of me $ but alas ! falling early into the Sea- 
faxing Life, which of all the Lives is the mod deftitute 
of the Fear of God, tho* his Terrors are always before 
them ; I fay, falling early into the Sea-faring Life, and 
into Sea-faring Company, all that litfle Senfe of Keli* 
gion which I had entertain'd, was laught out of me by 
my Mefs-Mates, by a harden'd defpifing of Dangers, 
and the Vieitfs of Death, which grew habitual tome, 
by my long Abfence from all manner of Opportunities 
to converfe with any thing but what was like my felf, 
or to hear any thing that was good, or tended to- 
wards it. 

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the 
leaft Senfe of what I was, or was to be, that in the 
greateft Deliverances I enjoy'd, fuch as my Efcape from 
Satize> my being taken up by the, Portuguese Mailer of 
the Ship, my being planted fo well in Brtftls, my re* 
ceiving the Cargo from England^ and the like, I nevec

or in my M outh ; nor in the greateft Diftrefs had I fo 
much as a Thought to pray to him ; or fo much as to 
day, Lord have mercy upon me I no not to mention the 
Name of God, unlets it was to fwear by, and blafpheme 
it. 

I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for many 
Months, as 1 have already obferv'd, on the Account of 
my wicked and harden'd Life pail •, and when I look'd 
about me, and confider'd what particular Providences, 
had attended me iince my coming into this Place, and 
how God had dealt bountifully with me \ had not only 
punifhed me lefs than my Iniquity had deferved, but 
had lb plentifully provided for me •, this gave me great 
Hopes that my Repentance was accepted, and that 
GOD had yetMercies in Store for me. 

With thefe Reflections I work'd my Mind up, not 
©nly to Refignation to the Will of God in the prefent 
Diijpofition or' my Circumftances, but even to a flncere 
Thankfulnefs for my Condition \ and that 1 who was

many Mercies which I had no Rcafon to have expected

for that daily Bread which nothing but a Cloud of

( **7 ) 

and after I made a )uft Improvement of thefe Things 
I went away and was no more fad, 

I had now been here ie long, that many Things which 
I brought on Shore for my Help, were either quite 
gone, or very much wafted and near fpent. 

My Ink, as I obferv'd* had been gone for fome Time* 
all but a very little, which I eek'd out with Water a lit- 
tle and a little, till it was fo pale it fcarce left any Ap. 
pearance of Black upon the Paper : As long, as it lafted 
I made itie of it to Minute down the Days of the 
Month on which any remarkable Thing happen'd to 
me 5 and firft by cafting. up Times paft, I remember 
that there was a fbange Concurrence of Days, in the va- 
rious- Providences which befel me, and which, if 1 had 
been fuperftitioufly inclin'd to obferve Days as Fatal or 
Fortunate, I might have had Reafon to have look'd up* 
©n with a great deal of Cudofity. 

Firft, I had obferv'd, that the fame Day that I broke 
away from my Father and my Friends, and run a- 
way to Hull in order to go to Sea, the fame Day after- 
wards I was taken by the SaUee Man of War, and made 
a Slave. 

The fame Day of the Year that I efcap'd out of the 
Wreck of that Ship in Yarmouth Roads, that fame Day 
cf the Year afterwards I made my Eicape from Sails tin 
the Boat. 

The fame Day of the Year I was born on, (v*tO the 
aoth of September, the fame Day I had my Life ib mi- 
raculouily faved 26 Years after, when 1 was caft on 
Shore in this Wand 5 fo that my wicked Life and foli- 
-tary Life began both on a Day. 

The next Thing to my Ink's being wafted, was that 
©f my Bread, I mean the Bisket which I brought out of 
the Ship; This I had husbanded to the laft Degree,allow- 
ing my felfbut one Cake of Bread a Day, for above a 
Year $ and yot I was quite without Bread for a Year be- 
fore I got any Corn of my own ' y and great Reafon I had 
to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it be- 
ing, as has been already oblerved, next to miraculous* 

My Clothes began to decay too mightily : As to Lin- 
nen, £ had none a good while, except fome checquer'd 
.Shirts which I found in the Chefts pi the other Sea- 

G 4. men r 



(128) 

men, and which I carefully preferv'd, becaufe many 
Times I could hear no other Clothes on but a Shirt; 
and it was a very great Help to me that I had among 
all the Mens Clothes of the Ship almoft three Dozen of 
Shim. There were alfo feveral thick Watch Coats of 
the Seamens, which were left indeed, but they were too 
hot to wear ; and tho' it is true, that the Weather 
was fo violent hot, that there was no need of Clothes, 
yet I could not go quite naked j no, tho* I had been 
inclined to it, which I was not, nor could I abide the 
Thoughts of it, tho' I was all alone. 

One Reafon why I could not go quite naked, was, 
I could not bear the Heat of the Sun fo well when 
quite naked, as with fome Clothes on 5 nay, the very 
Heat frequently blifter'd my Skin j whereas with a 
Shirt on, the Air it felf made fome Motion, and whift- 
ling under that Shirt, was twofold cooler than without 
4&: No mare could I ever bring myfelf to go out in the 
Heat of the Sun without a Cap or Hat; the Heat of 
the Sun beating with fuch Violence as it does in that 
tPlace, would give me the Head-Ach prefently,' by dart- 
ing fo directly on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on 5 
fo that i could not bear it ; whereas if I put on my Hat£ 
it would prefently go away. 

Upon thofe Views I began to confider about putting 
the few Rags I had, which I call'd Clothes, into fome 
Order : I had worn out all the Wafte-coats I had, and 
my Bufmefs was now to try if I could not make Jackets 
out of the great Watch- Coats which I had by me, and 
with fuch other Materials as I had ; fo I fet to work a 
Tayloring, or rather indeed a Botching*, for .»I made 
moft piteous Work of it. However, I made fhift to make 
two or three new Waftecoats, which I hoped would ferve 
me a great while ; as for Breeches or Drawers, 1 made 
but very forry fhift indeed, till afterward. 

I have mentioned, that I faved the Skins of all the 
Creatures that I kill'd, I mean four-footed ones, and I 
had hung them up ftretch'd out with Sticks in the Sun, 
by which means fome of them were fo dry and hard 
that they were fit for little, but others it feems were 
very ufeful. The firfl thing I made of thefe was a 
great Cap for my Head, with the Hair on the Outfide 

to 



( Vap ) 

to fhoot off the Rain $ and this I perform'd fo well, that 
after this I made a Suit of Clothes wholly of thofe 
Skins ; that is to fay, a Wafteeoat, and Breeches open at 
Knees, atod both loofe, for they were rather wanting 
to keep me cool, than to keep me warrru I mud; not 
omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly made ; 
for if I was a bad Carpenter, I was a worfe Taylor : 
However, they were fuch as I made very good Ihift 
with 5 and when I was abroad, if it happen'd to Rai», 
the Hair of of the Waftecoat and Cap- being outermoft, 
I was kept very dry. 

After this- I fpent a great deal of Time and Pains to* 
make me an Umbrella. I was indeed in great Want of 
one, and had a great Mind to make one ; I had feen> 
them made in the Brafils, where they are very ufeful 
in the great Heats which are there: And I fete the 
Heats every Jot as great here, and greater too, being 
nearer the Equinox; befides, as I was obliged to be: 
much abroad, it was a mod ufeiul thing to me, as^wett 
tor the Rains as the Heats. I took a world of Pains- 
at it, and- was a great while before i could make any 
thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit 
the Way, 1 fpoilt 2 or 3 before I made one to my Mi*id £ 
but at Uui I made one that anfwer'd indifferently well f 
the main Difficulty I found was to make it to letdown* 
I could make it to fpread, but if it did not let down too^ 
and draw in-; it would not be portable for. me any Way 
but juft over mjfeHead, whkh would not do : However* 
atlaflfe, as I faid, I made one to anfwer, I cover'd is 
with Skins, the Hair, upwards, fo that it caft off the? 
Rain like a Pent- houfe, and kept off the. Sun fo effec- 
tually, that Icauldwalk out in the hotted- of the Weas- 
ther, with, greater Advantage than i could before in the* 
cooleft,and when I had no Need of it> I could clofeitr 
and, carry it under my Arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind being 
entirely compofed by refigiiing to the Will of God, and 
throwing my felf wholly upon theDifpofal of his Provi- 
dence : This made my Life better then fociable; for: 
when I began to regret the want ot ConverfatioBj S 
would ask my felf, whether thus cotwerfing, mutually 
with my own Thoughts, and as 1 hope I may fay,- wuftt

&ren my Maker by Ejaculations and Petitions, was not 
better than the utunort Enjpymentof human Society ia 
the World ? 

; I cannot fay, that after this, for five Years, any ex- 
traordinary Thing happen'd tome, but I liv'd on in the 
fame Courfc, in the fame Pofture and Place, juft as be* 
fore: T lie chid Thing I was employ'd in, befidesmy 
yearly Labour of planting my Barley and Rice, and 
curing my Raifin% of both which I always kept up juil 
enough to have ntiiicient Stock of. one Year's ProvifH 
oris beforehand ; I fay, be/ides this yearly Labour, and 
my daily Labour or goingout with my Gun, I had one 
Labour to make me a Canoe, which at lad I finiflied : 
So that bydiginga Ganaltoit of fix, Foot wide, and 
four Foot deep, 1 brought it into the Creek, almoft half 
a Mile. As for the firft, which was fa ,vaftly big, as 
I made it without eonfidering before-hand, as 1 ought 
to;do, hmi I ihouU fee able to launch it; forever being 
3ble to bring it to the Water, or bring the Water to 
it, ; I vvas obliged to let it lie where it was, as a Me* 
m rmd&m to teach me to be wifer next Time. Indeed 
the next Time, tho' I could not get a Tree proper for 
it, and was in a Place where I could not get the Water 
to it 9 at any leis DMbnee than as I have faid, of near half 
a Mile ; yet as I faw it was pra&ible at lad, I never 
gave it dver ; and though I was near two Years about 
it, yet I never grudged my Labour, in Hopes of hav- 
ing a Boat to go off to Sea in at lift, m 

However* tho' my little Periugu* was. fini&'d, yet 
the Size of it was not at all anfwerable to the Delign 
which I had in View, when I made the £ril ; I mean 
•f venturing, over to the Term Fir ma, where it was 
above forty Miles broad; accordingly, the fmallnefs of 
my BoatraiTtfted to put an End to that Delign, and now 
I thought no more of it : But as I had a Boat, my next 
Belign 'was £<P*&ake k Tour round the Iftand j for as 
I had been on the ather Side, in one Place, eroding* 
as-I have already defcribed it} over the band ; fo the 
Difcoveries I made in that Journey, made me very 
eager to fee the other Parts of the Coaft ; and now I 
had a Boat, I thought, of nothing but- failing round 
f&elfland. , 

lor 



For this Purpofe, and that I might do every thing, with 
Difcretion and Confideration, 1 fitted up a little Mad 
to my Boat, and made a Sail to it out of fbme of 
the Pieces of the Ship's Sails, which lay in Store # arid of 
which I had a great Stock by me. 

Having fitted my Maft and Sail, and tried the Boat, 
I found ilie would fail very well : Then I made little 
Lockers or Boxes, at either End of my Boat, to put 
Provifions, Neceifaries, and Ammunition, CSV. into, to 
be kept dry, either from Rain, or the Sprye of the Sea ; 
and a little long hollow Place I cut in the Infide of the 
Boat, where I could lay my Gun, making a Flap to 
hang down over it to keep it dry. 

I iix'd my Umbrella alto in a Step at the Stern, like 
a Maft, to ftand over my Head, and keep the Heat of 
the Sun off of me like an Auning; and thus I every 
now and then took a little Voyage upon the Sea, but 
never went far out, nor far from the little Creek ^ but 
at lall being eager to view ^ the Circumference of my 
little Kingdom, I refolv'd upon my Tour, and accor- 
dingly 1 vi&uall'd my Ship for the Voyage ; putting in 
two Dozen of my Loaves, ( Cakes I ihould rather call 
them) of Barley-Bread ; an Earthern Pot full of parch'd- 
Rice, a Food I eat a great deal of; a little Bottle of 
Rum, half a Goat,and Powder with Shot for killing,, 
more, and two large Watch -coats, of thofe winch, asl 
menrion'd before, I had fav'd out of the Seamens Chefts ,; 
thefe I took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover 
me in the Night* 

It was the fixth of November, in the fixth Year of my 
Ueign, or my Captivity, which you pleafe, that I fct 
out on this- voyage, and I found it much longer than I 
expefted^for tho' the Ifland itfelf was not very large, 
Vet when 1 came to the Eafl Side of it, I found a great 
Ledge of Rocks lie out about two Leagues into the Sea* 
fome above Water, lome under it ; and beyond that, a 
Shoal of Sand, lying dry half a League more ; fo that I 
wasoblig'd to go a greatWay out to Sea to double that 
P&int. * 

When firftJ difcover'd them? 1 was. going to give over 
my Enter prize, and come back again, not knowing. 
bow far it might oblige me to go out to Sea y and above 

allj 



( *i'3* ) 

all, doubting how I fhould get back again} fo I came 
to an Anchor, for I had made me a kj|d of an Anchor 
with a Piece of a broken GrapTirii* which I got out of 
the Ship, / ' 

Having fecur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, ani went 
on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which feem'd to 
overlook that Point, where I faw the full Extent of it^ 
and refolv'd to venture. Jv 

In my viewing, the Sea frorft tnat Hill where Iftood, 
I perceiv'd a ftrong, and indeed," a moil furious Cur- 
rent, which run to the Eaft^ and even came clofe to the 
Point ; and I took the more Notice of it, becaufe I faw 
there might be fome Danger, that when I came into it, 
1 might be carried out to Sea by the Strength of it, 
and not be able to make the Wand again ; And indeed, 
had I not gotten Brdt up upon this Hill, I believe it 
would have been fo ; for there was the fame Current on 
the other Side the I (land, only that it fet off at a far- 
ther Diftance •, and I faw there was a ftrong Eddy unr 
der the Shore ; fo I had nothing to do but to get in 
©Ut of the firft Current and 1 ihould prefently be in 
an Eddy. 

I lay here, however, two Days; becaufe the Wind 
blowing pretty frefli at E*S.E. (and that being juft con- 
trary to the faid Current) made a great Breach of the 
Sea upon the Point} fo that it was not fafe for me to 
keep too clofe to the Shore for the Breach, nor to go 
too far off becaufe of the Stream. 

The third Day in. the Morning the Wind having 
abated over Night, the Sea was calm, and I ventur'd\$ 
but I am a Warning-Piece again to all rafh and igno- 
rant Pilots ; for no ibdner was I come to the Point, when 
jfcven I was not my Boat's Length from the Shore, but. I 
'found my felf in a great Depth of Water, and a Current 
like the Sluice of a Mill : It carried my Boat along with 
it w|th fuch Violence, that all I could do s could not 
keep her fo much as on the Edge of it; but I found 
it hurried me farther and farther out from the Eddy, 
which was on my Left Hand. There was no Wind 
ftirring to help me, and all I could do with my Pad- 
dles Hgnified nothing ; and now I began to give my 
felf over for loft ; for as the Current was on both Sides 

the 



(133) 

tEe Maud, I knew in a few Leagues Diftance they 
muft join again, and then I was irrecoverably gone j 
nor did I Fee any Poflibility of avoiding if, fo that I 
had no Profpeft before me but of perifhing *, not by the 
Sea, for that was calm enough, but of ftarving for Hun- 

fer. I had indeed found a Tortoife on the Shore, as 
ig almoft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the 
Boat ; and I had a great Jar of freili Water, that is 
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots ; but what was all this 
to being driven into the vaft Ocean, where, to be fure, 
there was no Shore, no main Land, or I (land, for a 
thoufand Leagues at lead ? 

Andnow I law how eafy it was for the Providence of 
God to make the mod mferableCondition that Mankind 
could be in, vaorfe. Now I look'd back upon my de- 
folate folitary lfland, as the mod pleafont Place in the 
World, and all the Happinefs my Heart could wifti for, 
was to be but there again : I ftretch'd out my Hands 
to it with eager Wifhes ; O happy Defart, laid I, I 
fliall never fee thee more ^ O miierable Creature, faid 
I, whether am I eoing! Then I reproach'd my felf 
with my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at 
my folitary Condition ; and now what would I give to 
be on Shore there again ? Thus we never fee the true 
State of our Condition, till it is illuftrated to us by its 
Contraries ; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but 
by the Want of it : It is fear ce poffible to imagine the 
Confternation I was now in, being driven from my be- 
loved lfland ( for fo it appeared to me now to be ) into 
the wide Ocean, almoft two Leagues, and in the ut- 
rnoft Defpair of ever recovering it again .* However I 
wbrk'd hard till indeed my Strength was almoft ex- 
haufted, and kept my Boat as much to the Notthward 9 
that is, towards the Side of the Current which the Ed- 
dy lay on, as poffibly I could ; when about Noon, as 
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a little 
Breeze otWind in my Face, fpringihg up from the 
& S. E. This chear'd my Heart a little, and efpecially 
when in about half an Hour more it blew a pretty 
fmall gentle Gale : By this Time I was gotten at a 
frightful Diftance from the lfland, and had the leaft 
pfiud or hazy Weather interven*d, I had been undone, 

another

another- Way too; for I had no Compafson Baardj andt 
fhould never have known how to have fteer'd towards 
the Ifland, If I had but once loft Sight of it ; but the 
Weather continuing clear, 1 applied my felf to get up 
my Maft again, fpread my Sail, {tending away to the 
North as much aspoflible, to get out of the Current. 

Juft as I had fet my Maft and Sail, and the Boat be- 
gan to ftretch away,- 1 faw even by the Clearnefs of the 
Water, fo.me Alteration of the Current was near*, for 
where the Current was fo ftrong, the Water was foul ; 
but perceiving the Water clear, I found the Current 
abate, and prefently I found to the Ea/I 9 at about half 
a Mile, a Breach of the Sea upon fome Rocks ; thefe 
Rocks I found caus'd the Current to part again ; and as 
the main Strefsofit ran away more Southerly y leaving 
the Rocks to the Nortb-Eaft, (6 the other return'd by the 
ttepuife of the Rocks, and made a ftrong Eddy, which 
ran back again to the North-Weft with a very fliarp 
Stream* 

They who know what it is to have a Reprieve 
brought to them upon the Ladder, or to be refcued 
from Thieves juft going to murder them, or who have 
been in iiich like Extremities, may guefs what my pre- 
sent Surprize of Joy was, and how gladly I put my 
Boat into the Stream. of this Eddy, and the Wind alfo 
freshening, how gladly I fpread mjf Sail to it, running 
chearfully before the Wind, and with a ftrong. Tide or 
JBddy under Foot^ 

This Eddy carried me about a League in my Way 
Back again dire<ftly towards the Ifland, but about two 
Leagues more to the Northward than the Current lay, 
which carry'd me away at iirftjfo that when I came near 
the Ifland, I found my felf open to the Northern Shore 
fcfit, that is to fay, the other End of the Ifland, op* 
pofite to that which I went out from. 
v . When I had made fomething more than a League of 
Way by the Help of this Current or Eddy, I found it 
1»as fpent and ferv'd me no farther. However, I found 
that being between the two great Currents, ( vi%. ) that 
on the South Side, which had hurried me away, and 
that on the North, which lay about a League on the 
©tijer. Side:- J fry, between thefe two, in the. Wake of 

tife 



thelfland* I foiind the Water at leaft ftitt", and running; 
no Way; an4 having ftill a Breeze of Wind fair for? 
me, I kept on fteeringdire&ly for the Ifland, tho' not 
niaking^iiichJrefh Way as I did before. 

About four a-Clock in the Evening, being then with- 
in about & League of the Ifland, I found the Point of 
the Rocks which occasioned thisDi&fter, ftretching out, 
as is defcribed before, to the Southward, and callings 
off the Current more Southwardly, had df courfe made 
another Eddy ty the North, and this I found very 
ftrong, but not dire&ly fetting the Way my Courfe Iay> 
which was due Weft,, but almoft full North. How- 
ever, haying a frefh Gale, I ftretch'd a-crofs this Eddy 
flan ting.North.W eft, and in about an Hour came with- 
in about a Mile of the Shore, where it being, fraooth 
Water,, I foon got to Land. 

When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees* and gave 
God Thanks for my Deliverance, refolving to lay aflde 
all Thoughts of my, Deliverance by my Boat; and re* 
frejhihg my felf with fuch Things as I had, I brought 
^ny Bo^tclofe to t^lie Shore in a little Cove that I had 
fpy'd under; fome Trees, and laid me down to fleep, be- 
ing quite fpent with the Labour ana Fatigue of the 
Voyage- 

I was npw at a great Lofs which Way to get Home 
with my Boat : I Sad run fo much ftaxard, and knew 
too much the Cafe to think of attempting it by the 
Way I went put 5 and what might be at the other Side, 
(I mean the Weft-Side) I knew iiot, nor had I any 
Mind to run anymore Ventures,, fo I only refolved in 
the Morning to make my Way Weftward along, the 
Shore, and to fee if there was no Creek where I mighfc 
lay up my Fregate in Safety, io as to have her again if 
I wanted her. In about three Miles, or thereabout* 
coafting the Shore, I came to a very good Inlet, or 
Bay^ about a Mile over, which; narrow'd till it came 
to a very little Rivulet or Brook* where I found a 
convenient Harbour for my Boat, and where (he lay as 
if fhe had been in a little Dock made on purpofe for 
her ; Here I put in, and having ftowtt my Boat verj* 
fefe, I went on Shore to look about me, and fee wiae*e 
iwas* ■ . > 



I foon found I had; but a Kttle pafs'd by the Place 
where I had been before, when I travell'd on Foot to 
that Shore; fo taking nothing out of my Boat, but my 
Gun and my , Umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I 
began my March : The Way was comfortable enough 
after fuch a Voyage as I had been upon, and I reach'd 
my old Bower in the Evening, where I found every 
thing {landing as I left it ; for I always kept it in good 
Order, being, as I faid before 1 , my Gountry-houfe. 

I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the Shade 
to reft my Limbs/ for I was very weary,' and fell afleep : 
But judge you, if yon can,, that read my 'Story what a 
Surpriie I muft be in, when I was wak 'd Gut of my 
Sleep by a Voice calling me by my Name feyeral 
times, Robin, Robin , s Robin> Crufoe, poor Robin Crufoe ! 
where are you Robin Crujoe? Where are you? Where 
have you been ? 

I was fo dead afleep at firft^ being fatigu'd with Row- 
ing, or Paddling, as it is call'd, the firft Part of the Day, 
and Walking the latter Part,; that I did not Wdke 
thoroughly ; but^do2ing between' Seeping and wakifcg, 
thought I dreanfd that fome Body fpoke to me : But 
as the Voice continued to repeat Rabin Crufoe, Robin 
Crufce y at laft I began to awake more perfe&ly, and was 
at ftfft dreadfully frighted, and fhrted up in the utmoft 
Canfterriatfori : Bin; lap fcprief were my Eyes open, but 
I faw my Pol! fitting on the Top of the Hedge, arid im- 
mediately kiiew that it was he that fpbke so rue; for 
juft in fuch bemoaning Language t had ufed to talk to 
him, and teach him; arid he had learned it ft) per fe^ly, 
that he would fit upon my Finger, and lay his Bill 
clofe to my Face, and cry, Poor Robin Crufoe, Where 
areiou ? Where have you been ? How come you here ? and 
fuch Things as I had taught him. 

However, even though I knew it was the Parrot, and 
that indeed it could be no body elfe, it was a good 
"while before I could compofe my felf. Firft, I was a* 
maz'd how the Creature got thither, and then how he 
Ihouldjuft keep about the Place, and nowhere elfe: 
But as f was well fatisfied it could be no Body but ho- 
neft PoBy I got k over ; and holding-out my Hand, and 
jcalling him by his Name ?q% the fociable Creattise

tame to ale, and 'fat upon my Thumb, as he_ufed to 
do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, 
and bow did I come here ? And where had I been ? Jufl 
as if he had been overjoy'd to fee me again ; and ib I 
carried him Home along with me. 

I had now had enough of rambling to? Sea forfome 
time, and had enough to do for many Days to fit ftil! > r 
and refle&upon the Danger I had been in: I would 
have been very glad to have had my Boat again on 
my Side of die Ifland; but I knew not how it was 
pra<5Hcable to get it about : As to the Eaft Side of the 
Ifland, which 1 had gone round, I knew well enough 
there was no venturing that Way ; my very Heart 
would ihrink, and my very Blood run chill but to 
think of it : And as to the other Side of the Ifland, I 
did not know how it might be there ; but fuppofing 
the Cur? ant ran with the fame Force againft the Shore 
at the Eaft, as it pafe'd by it on the other, I might 
run the fame Risk of being driven down the Stream, 
and carry'd by the Ifland, as I had been before, of be- 
ing carry'd away from it; fo with thefe Thoughts I 
contended my felf to be without any Boat, tho' it had 
hcen the Produ& of fo many Months Labour to make 
it, and of fo many more to get it unto tne Sea. 

In this Government of my Temper I remain'd near a 
Year, liv'd a very fedate retired Life, as you may well 
fuppofe; and my Thoughts being very much compos'd 
as to my Condition, and fully comforted in refigning my 
felf to the Difpofitions of Providence, I thought I liV'd 
really very happily in all things, except that of So- 
ciety. 

I improv'd my felf in this Time in all the mechanick 
Exercifes which my Neceflities put me upon applying 
my felf to, and I believe could, upon Occafion, have 
made a very good Carpenter, efpecially confidering how 
few Tools I had. 

Befldes this, I arriv'd at an unexpected Perfe<£Hon in 
thy Earthen Ware, and contrived well enough to make 
them with a Wheel, which I found infinitely eafierand 
better ; becaufe I made Things round and fliapeabley 
which before were filthy Things indeed to look on £ 
But I think I was never more vain of my own Perfor- 
mance, 



( n« ) 

mince, or more joyful for any Thing I found out, that* 
for my being able to make a Tobacco-Pipe ; and tho 5 
it was a very ugly clumfy Thing, when it was done, 
and only burnt red like other Earthen Ware, yet as it 
was hard and firm, and would draw- the Smoak, I was 
exceedingly comforted with it ; for I had been always 
ufed to Smoak, and there were Pipes in the Ship, but 
I forgot them at firft, not knowing that there was 
Tobacco in the I (land ; and afterward when I iearch'd 
the Ship again, I could not come at any Pipes at all. 

In my Wicker-ware alfo I improved much, and made 
Abundance of neceffary Baskets, as well as my Invention 
fliew'd me, thoughout very handfom, yet convenient for 
my laying. Things up in, or fetching Things home in. 
For Example, if I kill'd a Goat abroad, I could hang 
it up in a Tree, ilea it, and drefs it, and cut it in Pie- 
ces, and bring it home in a Basket j and the like by a 
Turtle, I could cut it up, take out the Eggs, and a 
Piece or two of the Fleflij which was enough for me, 
and bring, them home in a Basket, and leave the reft 
behind me z AWo large deep Baskets were my Recei- 
vers for my Com, which I always rubb'd out as fooa 
sis it was dry. and cured, and kept it in great Bas- 
kets inftead or a Granary. 

I began now to perceive my Powder abated confi* 
©erably, and this was a Want which it was impoflible 
for me to fupply, and I began ferioufly to confider what 
1 muft do when I fhould have no more Powder ; that 
i$ to fay, how I ihould do to kill any Goats* I had, 
as is obferVd in the third Year of my being here, kept 
a young Kid, and bred her up tame, I was in hopes of 
getting a He-Goat, but I could not by any means bring 
it to pafs> till my Kid grew an old Goat ; and I could 
iever fcnd in my Heart to kill her, till Ibe dy'd at lafi 
fif meer Age. 

But being now in the eleventh Year of my Residence* 
and, as I have faid, my Ammunition growing low, 1 
fet my felf to ftudy fome Art to trap and fnare the 
Goats, to fee whether I could not catch fome of them 
alive, and particulariy I wanjted a She.Goat great with 
Xoun& 

To 



To this Purpofe I made Snares to hamper tfiem, att& 
I do believe they were more than once taken in them ; 
But my Tackle was not good, for I had no Wire, and 
I always found them broken, and my Bait devour- 
ed. 

At length I re&lv'd to try a Pit-fall, Co I dug fevera! 
large Pits in the Earth, in Places where I had obferv'd 
the Goats ufedtafeed, and over thefe Pits I placed 
Hurdles of my own making too, with a great Weight 
upon them ; and feveral times I put Ears of Barley and 
dry Rice, without fetting the Trap, and I could eafily 
perceive that the Goats had gone in and eaten up the 
Corn, for I could fee the Mark of their Feet : At 
length I fet three Traps in one Night,, and going the, 
next Morning I found them all (landing, and yet the 
Bait eaten and gone; this was very difcouraging* 
However, I altered my Traps, and not to trouble you 
with Particulars, going one Morning, to fee my Traps, 
1 found in one. of them a large old He-Goat, and in 
one of the other three Kids, a Male and two Fe- 
Snales* 

As to the did orie r I knew not what to do with him,, 
Ifeiftafe'Jb fierce I dur& not go into the Pit to him; that 
is to fay, to go about to Wing him away alive, whichr 
was what I wanted : I could have ktll'd him, but that 
was not my Bufinefs, nor would it anfwer my End^ 
So I e'en letfhim out, and he ran away as if he had been 
frighted out or his Wits; But I had forgot then what 
I had learned afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Li- 
«n .• If I had let him (lay there three or four Day* 
Without Food, and then have carry'd him fome "Water 
to drink* and tfoen a little Corn* he would have been a* 
tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty fagaciou* 
tra&abte Creatures where they are well ufed. 

Howe^ep, for the preient I let him go, knowing no* 
better at that time ; then I went to three the Kids, and 
taking them one by one, I ty*d them With Strings to- 
gether, and With fome Difficulty brought them all 
home. 

It was a- good while before they would feed, but 
throwing them fome fweet Corn, it tempted them, and 
the^y began to be tame : And-now I found that if I ex- 

pe&ed 



( 'i4o ) 

pe&ed to fupply my felf with Goat Flefh, when I had 
no Powder or Shot left, breeding fome up tame was ni) 
only Way, when perhaps I might have them about my 
Houfe like a Flock of Sheep. 

But then it presently occur'd to me, that I mud keep 
the Tame from; the Wild, or elfe they would always 
run wild wl|ien they grew up 5 and the only Way iot 
this was to have fome encloied Piece of Ground, well 
fenc'd either with Hedge or Pale, to keep them up 
fo e/Fe£ually, that thofe within might not break out, 
or thofe without break in. 

This was a great U ndertaking for. one Pair of Hands \ 
yet as I faw there was an . abfolute Neceffity of doing it, 
my iirft Piece of Work was to find out a proper Piece of 
Ground, vi%* where there was likely to be Herbage for 
them to eat, Water for them to drink, and Cover to 
keep them from the Sun. 

Thofe who underfhnd fuch Enclofures will think I 
had very little Contrivance, when I pitched upon a 
Place very proper for all thefe, being a plain open Piec? 
of Meadow-Land or Savanna, (as our People call it ia 
the Wellerrn Colonies,) which had two or three little 
t>rHls of ;f reft Water in it, and at one end was very 
woody ; I fay they will finale at my Forecaft, when .( 
flialltell them I began my ^nclo/ing of this Piece of 
Ground in fuch a Manner, that my Hedge or Pale mull: 
have been at leaft two Mile about 5 Nor was the Mad* 
nefsof it fo great as to the, Cwipafs, for if it was ten 
Mile about I was like to have time enough to do it in : 
But I did not confider that my Goats would be as wild 
in fo much Compafs, as if they had had the whole h 
fland, and I fhould have fo much Room to chafe them 
in t that I fhould never catch them. 

My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe about 
&fty Yards, when this Thought occur'd to me ; fo 1 
prefently ftopt fhort, and for the firft Beginning I re- 
iblv'd to inclofe a Piece pf about 1 50 Yards in Length, 
and 100 Yards in Breadth, which as it would maintain 
as many as I ihould have in any reafonable Time, fo as 
my Flock encreafed, I could add more Ground to my 
Enclpfure. * 

Thfi 



(MO 

This was a&ing with feme Prudence, and I went tS 
work with Courage 5 I was about three Months hedg* 
ing in the firft Piece, and till I had done it I tether'd 
the three Rids in the beft Part of it, and ufed them to 
feed as near me as poflible to make them familiar ; and 
very often I would go and carry them fome Ears of Bar- 
ley, or a Handful of Rice, and feed them out of my 
Hand ; fo that after my Inclofure was iinilh'd, and I 
let them loofe, they would follow me up and down, 
bleating after me for a Handful of Corn. 

This anfwer'd my End, and in about a Year and half 
I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Kids, and all ; 
and in two Years more I had three and fortj', befides 
feveral that I took and kill'd for my Food ; And after 
that I inclofed five feveral Pieces of Ground to feed 
them in, with little Penns to drive them into, to take 
them as I wanted them, and Gates out of one Piece of 
Ground into another. 

But this was not all 5 for now I not only had Goats- 
Fleih to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk too, a thing 
which indeed in my Beginning I did not fo much as 
think of> and which, when it came into my Thoughts, 
was really an agreeable Surprize ; For now I fet up my 
Dairy, and had fometunes a Gallon or two of Milk in 
a Day. And as Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to 
every Creature, di&ates even naturally how to make 
ufe of it ; fo I that had never milk'd a Cow, much Ids 
a Goat, or feen Butter or Cheefe made, very readily 
and handily, tho' after a great many EfTays and Mis- 
carriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe at laid, and 
never wanted it afterwards. 

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his Crea- 
tures, even in thofe Conditions in which they feem'd to 
he over-whelm'd in Deftru&ion ! How can he fweeten 
the bittereft Providences, and give us Caufe to praife 
him for Dungeons and Prifons ! What a Table was here 
ftreadforme in a Wildernefs, where I faw nothing at 
nrft but to periih for Hunger ! 

It would have made a Stoick Smile to have feen me 
and my little Family fit down to Dinner ; there was 
*tty Majefty, the Prince and Lord of the whole Ifland: 
I had the Lives of all my Subje&s at my abfolute 

Com- 



( i'4» ) 

fComtn&tid* I could hajog, draw, give Life and Liberty 
and take it away, and no Rebels among all my Subjects, 

Then to fee how like a Ring I din'd too, all alone, 
attended by my Servants ; PoB> as if he had been my 
Favourite, was the only Perfon permitted to talk to 
me; my Dog, who was now grown very old and 
crazy, and found no Species to multiply his Kind up* 
on, fat always at my Right Hand ; and two Cats, one 
on one Side the Table, and one on the other, expe<&« 
ing now and then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of 
fpeeiai Favour. 

But thefe were not the tmo Cats which I brought 013 
Shore at firft, for they were both of them dead, and 
iiad been interr'd near my Habitation by my own 
Hands ; but one of them having multiply'd hy I know 
not what Kind of Creature, thefe were two which I 
liad preferv'd tame, whereas the reft run wild in the 
Woods, and became indeed troublefome to meat laft,; 
for they would often come into my Houfe, and plunder 
me too, till at laft I was obliged to fhoot them, and did 
.kill a great many ; at length they left me with this At* 
tendance ; and in this plentiful Manner I liv'd ; neither 
could I be faid to want any Thing but Society, and of 
that in fome time after this I was like to have too much* 

I was fomething impatient, as I have obferv'd, te 
have the Ufe of my Boat, tho 5 very loath to run any 
•more Hazards ; and therefore fometimes I fat contriv- 
ing Ways to get her about the Ifland,, and at other times 
I fat my felf down contented enough without her. But I 
had a ftrange Uneafinefs in my Mind to go down to 
ithe Point of the Ifland, where, as I have laid, in my 
laft Ramble, I went up the Hill to fee how the Shore 
lay, and how the Current ftt y that I might fee what ! 
had to do ± This Inclination increafed upon me every 
Day, and at length I refolved to travel thither by 
Land; and following the Edge of the Shore I didfo:Bufi 
had any one in England been to meet fuch a Man as 1 
was, it muft either have frighted them, or. raifed a great 
deal of Laughter; and as I frequently ^ood flill to 
look at my felf, I could not but fmile at the Notion of 
my travelling thro' Torkjhire with fuch an Equipage^ and 

m 



< Mi ) 

In fuch a Drefe. Be pleafed to take a Sketch of ikj* 
Figure as follows. * 

1 had a great high fhapelefs Cap, made of a Goat's 
Skin, with a Flap hanging down behind, as well to 
Jceep the Sun from me, as to fhoot the Rain oil from 
running into my Neck ; nothing being fo hurtful in 
thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the Fleih under the 
Clothes. 

I had a fhort Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts coming 
down to about the Middle of my Thighs; and a Pair 
of open-kneed Breeches of the fame ; the Breeches were 
made of the Skin of an old He-goat, whofe Hair hung 
down fuch a Length on either Side, that like Pantaloons 
it reach'd to the Middle of my Legs. Stockings and 
Shoes I had none, but I had made me a Pair ot fome- 
thing, I fcarce know what to call them, like Buskins, 
to flap over my Legs, and lace on either Side like Spat- 
terdafhers; but of a mod barbarous Shape, as indeed 
were all the reft of my Cloaths. 

I had on, a broad Belt of Goat's Skin dry'd, which 
I drew together with two Thongl of the fame, inftead 
of Buckles, and in a kind of ^ Frog on either Side of 
this, inftead of a S weird and a Dagger, hung a little Saw 
and a Hatchet, one on one Side, one on the other : I 
had another Belt not fo broad, and faften'd in the fame 
manner, which hung over my Shoulder ; and at the 
End of it, under my left Arm hung two Pouches, both 
made of Goat's Skin too ; in one of which hung my 
Powder, in the other my Shot : At my Back I carried 
my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over my 
Head a great clumfy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrelfo, but 
which, alter all, was the nioft neceflfary thing I had 
about me, next to my Gun; As for my Face, the Co- 
lour of it was really not lb MoJetta like, as one might ex- 
pe& from a Man not at all careful of it, and living with- 
in 9 or 10 Degrees of the Equinox. My Beard I had 
once fiifferM to grow till it was about a Quarter of*,a 
Yard long; but as I Jiad both ScifTars and Razors fuffi- 
cient, I had cut it pretty fhort, except what grew oa 
my upper Lip, which I had trimm'd into a large Pair of 
Mahometan Whiskers, fuch as I had feen worn by fome 
%urks> whom I faw at Sallet, for the Moors did not wear 

fuch 



( x 44 ) 

Juch, tho'the Turks did; of thefe Muftachioes, or WHs* 
kers, I will not fay they were long enough to hang my 
Hat upon them, but they were of a Length and Shape 
monftrous enough, and fuch as in England would have 
paffed for frightful. 

But all this is by the by ; for as to my Figure, I had 
fo few to obierve me, that is was of no manner of Con* 
fequence; fo I fay no more to that Part : In this kind 
of Figure I went my new Journey, and was out five or 
fix Days. I travell'd firft along the Sea-Shore, dire£« 
Jy to the Place where I firft brought my Boat to an An- 
chor, to get up upon the Rocks ; and having no Boat 
now to take care of> I went over the Land a nearer 
Way, to the fame Height that I was upon before ; when 
looking forward to the Point of the Rocks which lay 
out, and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, 
as I faid above, I was furpriz'd to fee the Sea all fniooth 
and quiet, no Rippling, no Motion, no Current, any 
more there than in other Places. 

I was at a ftrange Lofs to underftand this, and refblv'd 
to fpend fome Time in the obferving it, to fee if nothing 
from the Sets of the Tide had occafion'd it j but I was 
prefently convinced how it was, xwj. That the Tide of ; 
Ebb fetting from the Weft, and joyning with the Cur- 
rent of Waters from fome great River on the Shore, muft 
be the Occafion of this Current; and that according as 
the Wind blew more forcible from the We[i> ox from 
the North, this Current came near, or went farther 
from the Shore ; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, 
I went up to the Rock again, and then the Tide of Ebb 
being made, I plainly faw the Current again as before, 
only, that it ran farther off, being near half a League 
from the Shore ; whereas in my Cafe, it fet clofe upon 
the Shore, and hurried me and my Canoe along with it, 
which at another Time it would not have done. 

This Obfervation convinc'd me, That I had nothing 
to do buttoobferve the Ebbing and the Flowing of the 
j. ide, and I might very eafily bring my Boat about the 
Ifland again ; but when I begap to think of putting it 
in Practice, I had fuch a Terror upon my Spirits at 
the Remembrance of the Danger I had been in, that 1 
could not think of it again with any Patience ; but on 

the 



( 106 ) ./£ 

tlie contrary, I took Up another Refolution, which was 
more fate, though more laborious ; and this was, That 
I would build, or rather make me another Periagua, or 
Canoe ; and fo have one for one Side of the Ifland, and 
btoe for" the other. 

Yoti are to underftand, that now! had, as I may cafl 
it, two Plantations in the Illand •, one my little Forti- 
fication or Tent, with the Wall about it under the 
Rock, with the Cave behind me, which by this Time 
I had enlarg'd into feveral Apartments or Caves, one 
, within another. One of theie, which was the dryeft, 
and largeft, and had a Door out beyond my Wall or 
Fortification ; that is to fay, beyond where my Wall 
j)in y d to the Rock, was all fill' d up with the large Ear. 
then Pots, oi: which I have given an Account, and with 
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five 
or fix Bufhels each, where I laid up my Stores of Pro- 
vifion, efpecially my Corn, fome in the Ear cut of? 
fhort from the Straw, and the other rubbM out with" 
ifty Hand. 

^s for my, Wall made, as before, with long State's 
or Piles, thofe Piles grew all like Trees, and were by 
this Time grown io big, and fpread fo very much. 
that there was not the lead Appearance to any one's 
View of any Habitation behind them. 

Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther With- 
in the Land, and upon lower Ground, lav riiy two Pie- 
ces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly cultivated 
and fow'd, and which duly. yielded me their Harveft in 
its Seafon ; and whenever I had Occafion for more Cdrn > 
I had more Land adjoining as fit as that. 

Befides'this, I had my Country Scat, and I had now 
a tolerable Plantation there alto ; for -fir ft, I had ii^v 
little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept in Repair; 
thzt is to fiy, I kept the Hedge which circled it in, 
conftantly fitted up to its ufual Height, the Ladder 
ftanding always in theinfide ; I kept the Trees which 
at fir ft were too inore than iny Stakes, but were now 
grown very firm and tall \ I kept them always Co ctft^ 
*hat they might fpread and grow thick and wild, and 
make the more agreeable Shade, which they did effec- 
tually to my Mind, In the middle of this I had my 



Tent always {landing, being apiece of a Sail fpread over 
Poles let up for that Purpole, and which never wanted 
any repair or renewing •, and under this I had made me 
a Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures I had 
kilFd, and with.other foft Things, and a Blanket laid 
on them, fuch as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I 
had faved, and a great Watcb-Coat to cover me ; and 
here, whenever 1 had occafion to be abfent from my 
chief Seat, I took up my Country Habitation. 

Adjoyning to this I had my Enclofures for my Cattle, 
that is to fay, my Goats: And as I had taken an incon- 
ceivable deal of pains to fence and enclofe this Ground, 
fo I was fo uneafy to fee it kept entire, left the Goats 
fliould break thro 5 , that I never left oiF, till with infi- 
nite Labour I had ftuck treQutfide of the Hedge fo full 
of fmall Stakes, and fo near to one an another, that it was 
rather a Pale than aHedge, and there was fcarce room to 
put a Hand thro' between them, which afterwards when 
thofe Stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy 
Sea Ton, made the Enclosure ftrong, like a Wall, indeed 
ftronger than any Wall. 

This will teftify for me that I was not idle, "and 
that I fpared no Pains to bring to pals whatever ap- 
pear' d neceflary for my comfortable Support ; for I con- 
iider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame Creatures thus 
at my Hand, would be a living Magazine of Flefh, 
Milk, Butter and Cheefe, for me, as long as I liv'd in the 
Place, if it were to be forty Years ; and that keeping 
them in my Reach, depended entirely upon my perfec- 
ting my finclofures to fuch a degree, that I might be 
fure of keeping them together ; which by this Method 
indeed I fo effectually i'ecured, that when thefe little 
Stakes began to grow, I had planted them fo very thick, 
I was forced to pull fonie of them up again. 

In this Place alio I had my Grapes growing, which I 
principally depended on for my Winter Store of Raifins, 
and which I never faiPd to preferve very carnally, as the 
heft and moft agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet ; and 
indeed they were not agreeable only, but phyiical, whole- 
Ibme, nourifhing and refrelhing to the laft degree. 

As 



( H7 ) 

As this was alfo about half way between my other 
Habitation and the Place where I had laid up my Boat, 
I generally ftay'd and lay here in my Way thither ; 
for I ufed frequently to vilit my Boat, and I kept all 
things about or belonging to her in very good Order ; 
fometimes I went out in her to divert my ielf, but na 
more hazardous Voyages would I go, nor fcarce ever 
above a Stone's Caft or two from the Shore, I was fo ap- 
prehenfive of being hurried out of my Knowledge a- 
gain by the Currents, or Winds, or any other Accident : 
But now I come to a new Scene of my Life. 

It happened one Day about Noon, going towards my 
Boat, I was exceedingly furpiz'd with the Print of a 
Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain 
to be feen in the Sand : I flood like one Thunder-ittuck, 
or as if I had feen an Apparition*, I litlen'd, I look'd round 
me, I could hear nothing, nor fee any thing •, I went 
up to a riling Ground to look farther : I went up the 
Shore, and down the Shore, but it was all one, I could 
fee no other Impreffion but that one, 1 went to it again 
to lee if there were any more, and to obferveif it might 
not be my Fancy ; but there was no Room for that, for 
there was exa&ly the very Print of a Foot, Toes, 
Heel, and every Part of a Foot ; how it came thither 
I knew not, nor could irr the leaft imagine. But after 
innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man perfe&ly 
confufed and out of my felf, i came home to my Forti- 
fication, not feeling, as we fay, the Ground I went on, 
but terrify'd to the lafl * degree, looking behind me at 
every two or three Steps, mifcaking every Buih and 
Tree, and fancying every Stump at a diflance to be a 
Man ; nor is it poflible to defcribe how many var ous 
Shapes afrighted Imagination reprefented things to me 
in ; how many wild Ideas were fqrm'd every Moment 
in my Fancy, and what ftrange unaccountable Whimfies 
came into my Thoughts by the Way. 

When I came to my Caftle, for fo I think I call'd it 
ever after this, I fled into it like one perfued ; whe- 
ther I went over by the Ladder, as flrft contriv'd, or 
went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I call'd a Door, 
I cannot remember*, for never frighted Hare fled to 
H 2 Cover, 



( H* ) 

Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more Terror cf Mind 
vthan I to this Retreat. 

I flept none that Night ; the farther I was from th? 

Occa/ion of my Fright, the greater my Apprehenilons 

were y which is fomething contrary to the nature of 

fiich things, and efpecially to the ulual Pra&ice of all 

Creatures in Fear : But I was io embarrafs'd with my 

own frightful Ideas of the Thing, that I form'd nothing 

butdifmal Imaginations to my fel£ even tho' I was now 

«& great way off it. Sometimes Tfancy'd it mud be the 

Devil •, and Realbnjoin'd in with me upon this Su.ppo* 

iition .* For how ihould any other thing in human Shape 

eome into the Place? Where was the Veilel that brought 

.them ? What Marks was there of any other Footfteps P 

And how was it poflible a Man ihould come there ? 

But then to think that Satan fhould take human Shape 

mpon hini in fuch a Place where there could be no man- 

Ber of Occafion for it, but to leave the Print of his 

Foot behind him, and that even for no Purpofe too 

( fohe could not be fure I ihould fee it ) this was an 

Amufement the other Way : I confider'd that the Devil 

.might have found out Abundance of other Ways to have 

Serrify'd me, than this of the fingle Print of a Foot. 

That as I lived quite on the otherilde of the Ifland, 

; he would never have been fo fimple to leave a Mark in 

; a Place where ft was ten Thouiand to One whether 

I fhould ever fee it or not, and in the Sand too, which 

ft-he fir ft Surge of the Sea upon a high Wind would have 

..defac'd entirely : All this feem'd inconfiftent with the 

Thing it (elf, and with ail Notions we ufuallv entertain 

<of the Subtiky of the Devil. 

Abundance of fuch Things as thefe afHfted to argue 
Mie o&t of all Apprehenilons of its b ing the Devil: 
And I prefently concluded then, that it muft be fome 
more dangerous Creature, vi\< That it muft be fome 
.of the Savages of the main Land over-againft me, who 
had wandered cut -to Sea in their Canoes, and either 
driven by the Currents, or by contrary Winds, had 
made the Ifland ; f and had been on Shore, but were gone 
away, again to Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have ftaid 
<in this defolate iftand, as I would -have' been to have 
;had &hem. 

While 



( w } 

While thefe Reileclions were rolling upon my Mirier 
f was very thank iul in my Thoughts, that I was io hap- 
py as not to be thereabouts at that Time, or that they 
did not lee my Boat, by which they would have con- 
cluded that Tome Inhabitants had been in the Place, and 
perhaps have fearcrfd farther for me .* Then, terrible- 
Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their having, 
found my Boat, and that Mere were People here ; and 
that it ib, I ihould certainly have them come again in 
greater Numbers, and devour me ; that if it fhould hap* 
pen fo tint they ihould not find m?, yet they would 
tind my Enelofure, deilroy all my Com, carry away all 
my Flock or' tame Goats, and I ihould periih. at lail fern 
meer Want. 

Thus my Fear ban iflvd all my Religious Hope, all 
that former Confidence in God, which was founded up- 
on fu?h wonderful Experience as I had had of his Good- 
nefs, now vanlih'd ; «.s-if he that hsd fed me by Mira- 
cle hitherto,- could not preurve by his Power the Pro- 
viiion which he had made for me by his Good nefs. I 
reproaeffd my fell with my Eallncis, that would not 
fow any more Corn one Year than. .would jud I'erve me 
till the next Seafon, as if no Accident could intervene 
to prevent my enjoying the Crop that was upon the 
Ground ; and this I thought fo ju(t a Reproof, that I 
reiblv'd for the future to have two -or three Years Corn* 
before-hand, fo that whatever might come, i might - 
not Perifh for Want of Bread. 

How Change a Chequer- Work of Providence is the 
Life of Man ! and by what fecret differing Springs are 
the A ffe£ions hurried about, as differing Qircumilances 
prefent 1 To Day we love what to Morrow we hate ; to 
Day we feek what to Morrow we fhun ; to Day we de- 
fire what to Morrow we fear ; 4iay, even tremble at the-' 
Apprehqiions o£ This was exemplified in me at this 
Time in the mod lively Manner imaginable ; for I, 
whole only Affli&ion was, that I feem'd banlih'd 1 rom 
human Society, that I was alone, circumlirib'd by the 
houndlefs Ocean, cut off from Mankind, asd condemn'd 
to what I call iilent Life ; that I was as one whom Hea- 
ven thought not worthy to be number'd among the Liv- 
ing, or to appear among the reft of his Creatures y that*

to have feen one of my own Species, would have feemM 
to me a Railing me from Death to Life, and the greateft 
BleiUng that Heaven itfelf, next to the fupreme blefling 
of Salvation, could beftow ; I fay, that I fhould now 
tremble at the very Apprehensions of feeing a Man, and 
was ready to fink into the Ground at but the Shadow, 01* 
iilent Appearance of a Man's having fet his Foot on 
the Wand. 

Such is the uneven State of Human Life ; and it af- 
forded me a great many curious Speculations afterwards, 
-when 1 had a little recovered my fi rfl Surprize ; I 
confidered that this was the Station of Life, the infi- 
nitely wife and good Providence of God had determin'd 
for me ; that as I could not forefee what the Ends of 
Divine Wifdom might be in all this, fo I was not to 
difpute his Sovereignty, who, as I was his Creature, had 
an undoubted Right by Creation, to govern and dif- 
pofe of me abfolutely as he thought fit ; and who, as I 
was a Creature who had offended him, had likewife 
a judicial Right to condemn me to what Funifli- 
ment he thought fit ; and that it was my Part to fubmit 
to bear his Indignation, becaufe I had flnn'd againfl 
him. 

I then reHe&ed, that God, who was not only Righ- 
teous but Omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to 
punifli and affliA me, fo he was able to deliver me ; 
that if he did not think fit to do it, 'twas my unquefU- 
on'd Duty to refign myfelf abfolute and entirely to his 
Will: And on the other hand, it was my Dutyalfoto 
hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the 
Di&ates and Directions of his daily Providence. 

Thefe Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days, 
nay, I may fay, Weeks and Months ; and one particu- 
lar Effc& of my Cogitations on this Oecaflon, I cannot 
omit, vl\. One Morning early, lying in my Bed, and 
iiil'd with Thoughts about my Danger from the Ap- 
pearance of Savages, I found it difcompos'd me very 
much ; upon which thofe Words of the Scripture came 
info my Thoughts, Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, 
and 1 mU delivery and thou jhalt ghrify me, 

Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my Bed, my 
Heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and 

encourag- 



(i5i) 

encouraged to pray earneftly to God for Deliverance,* 
When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and 
opening it to read, the fird Wortls that preferred to 
me, were, Watt on the Lor d> and be of geod Cheer •, and 
he Jhall ftrenqtben thy Heart, voatt y I fay, en the Lord, 
It is impoffible to exprefs the Comfort this gave me. 
and in return, I thankfully laid down the Book, and was 
no more fad, at lead, not on that Occafion* 

In the Middle of thefe Cogitations, Apprehenfions, 
and Reflexions, it came into my Thoughts one Day. 
that all this might be a meer Chimerea of my own, 
and that this Foot, might be the Print of my own 
Foot, whe$i I came on Shore from my Boat : This 
chear'd me up a little too, and I began to perfwade my 
felf it was all a Delufion ; that it was nothing elfe but 
my own Foot ; and why might not I come that Way 
from the Boat, as well as I was going that Way to 
the Boat ? Again, I confider'd alfo that I could by no> 
Means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I 
had not ; and that if at lad this was only the Print of 
my own Foot, I had piay'd the Part of thofe Fools, 
who ftrive to make Stories of Spe&res and Appari- 
tions, and then are themfelves frighted at them more 
than any Body elfe. 

Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad 
again; fori had not ftirr'd out of my Caftle for three 
Days and Nights ; fo that I began to ftarve for Provi- 
sion ; for I had little or nothing within Doors, but fome 
Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew that my Goats 
wanted to be milk'd too, which ufually was my Even- 
ing Diverfion ; and the poor Creatures were in great 
Pain and Inconvenience for want of it ; and indeed it 
almoft fpoil'd fome of them, and almoft dry'd up their 
Milk. . 

Heartning my felf therefore with the Belief that this 
was nothing but the Print of one of my own Feet, 
(and fo I might be truly laid to ftart at my own Sha- 
dow) I began to go abroad again, and went to my Coun- 
try-Houfe to milk my Flock ; but to fee with what Fear 
I went forward, how often I look'd behind me, how I 
was ready every now and then, to lay down my Baf- 
ket, and rur* for my Life, it would have ma<ie any on$ 
H. 4- h&ve 



( J 52 ), 



lave thought I was haunted with an evil Confcience, or. 
t^hat I Iiad been lately moft terribly frighted j- and Jo 
indeed 1 had. m 

However, as I went down thus two or,- three Days, 
and having feen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, 
and to think there was really nothing in it but my own 
Imagination ; but I could not perfwade my felf fully of 
this, till I jhould go down to the Shore again, and fee. 
this Print of a Foot, and meafure it by my own, and 
fee if there was any Mmilitude or Fitnefs, that I might, 
he a (lured it was my own Foot: But, when I came to, 
the Place fir ft, it appeared evidently to me, that when 
I laid up my Boat, I could not poflibly be on Shore any 
where thereabout : Secondly, when 1 came to meafure 
the Mark with my own Foot, I found my. Foot not. ib, 
large by a great deal ; both thefe. things fill'd my Head 
U'itb ntw Imaginations, and gave me the Vapours a- 
gain to the higheft degree ; io that I ihook with Cold,, 
like one in an Ague, and! went Home again, fill'd with 
the belief that fomv Man or Men had been on Shore. 
there; or,, in fliort, that the Ifland was inhabited, and. 
} might be furpriz'd before I was aware; and what 
Courie to take for my Security, I knew not? 

O what ridiculous Refoluttons Men take, when ppf- 
fefs'd -with Fear ! it deprives. them of the Ufe of thofe 
Means which Reafon offers for their Relief. The firft, 
thing I propofed to my ielf was, to throw down my 
Enclo fares, and turn all my tame Cattel wild into the 
Woods, that the Enemy might not find them, and then 
frequent the Ifland in Profpe& of, the fame, or the like 
Booty ; then to the flmple thing of digging up my two 
Ccrn~Fields, that they might not find iuch a Grain 
there, and kill be prompted to frequent the Ifland ; 
then todemolifh my Bower and Tent, that they might, 
not fee any Veftiges of Habitation, and be prompted to 
look further, in order to find out the Perfons inha- 
biting. 

Thefe were the Subject of the firft Night's Cogitation^ 
after I was come home again, while the Apprehcnfi- 
ons which had fo over run my Mind were frefh upon 
me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as above. 
Thus Fear of Danger is ten thoufand times more terrify: • 



( 153 ) 

ing.than Danger it felf, when apparent to the Eyes ; and 
we 'find the Burden of Anxiety greater by niu:h, tfcan 
the Evil which w r e are anxious about ; but, which was 
worfe than all this, I had not that Relief: in this Trouble 
from the Refignation I ufed to pra&iie, that I hoped to 
h'lve. I look'd, I thought, like Saul, who complained 
not only that the Vhilijimcs were upon him, but that 
God had forfaken him ; for I did not now take due ways 
to compofe my Mind, by crying to God in my Diftrefs* 
and refling upon his Providence, as I had done before* 
for my Defence and Deliverance; which it I had done f 
Iliad, at leafl, been more cheer ully fupported under 
this new Surprize, and perhaps carried through it with 
more Reiblution. 

This Confufion of my -Thoughts kept me waking all 
Night; but in the Morning I fell afleep, and having, 
by the Amufement of my Mind, been as it were tired * 
and my Spirits exhiufted, I flept very foundly, and 
wak'd much better compos'd than I had ever been be- 
fore : Andmow I began to think fedatdv ; and uporv 
the utmoft Debate with my felt, I concluded ,■ That this 
Ifland, which was fo exceeding plealant, fmkiul, and 
no farther from the main Land than as I had feen, was 
not fo entirely abandon'd as I might imagine : That al. 
tho' there were no flated Inhabitants who livM on the 
Spot ; yet that there might fometimes come Boaty obT 
front the Shore, who either with Dcfign, or perhaps 
never, but when they were driven by crofs Winds, might 
come to this Place. 

That I had Hv'd here 1 $ Years now, and had not met 
with the leaft Shadow or Figure of any People before; 
and that if at any Time they fhould be driven here, it 
was probable they went away again as foon as ever they 
could, feeing they had never thought fit to fix there 
upon any Occaflon, to this Time. 

That ths mod I could fuggeft any Danger from, wa% 
from any fuch cafual accidental Landing of* ilvaggjing, 
People from the Main, who^ as it was likely if they 
were driven hither, were here again ft their W'ilJs ; lb 
they made no ftay here,, but went off again with all 
poffible Speed, feldom (laying one Night on Shore, left 
they fhould not have the Help of the- Tides*, and Day. 



( 154 ) 

tight hack again ; and that therefore I had nothing (& 
do but to confider of fonie fafe Retreat, in Caie I fliould 
iee any Savages land upon the Spot. 

Now I began forely to repent, that I had dug my 
Cave fo large, as to bring a Door through again, which 
Door, as I laid, came out bsyond where my Fortifica- 
tion joyn'd to the Rock: Upon maturely confidering 
this therefore, I refolvM to draw me a fecond Fortifica- 
tion, in the fame Manner of a Semicircle, at a Diftance 
from my Wall, juil where I had planted a double Row 
©f Trees about twelve Years before, of which I made 
mention : Thefe Trees having been planted ib thick be- 
fore, there wanted but a few Files to be driven between 
them, that they fhould be thicker, and ftronger, and 
my Wall would be foon finifh'd. 

So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer Wall 
ivas thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Cables, and 
every thing I could think of to make it ftrong ; having 
in it feven little Holes, about as big as I might put my 
Arm out at. In the Infide of this I thickned my Wall 
to abeut tdn Foot thick, with continually bringing 
Earth out of my Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the 
Wall, and walking upon it; ana through the feven 
Holes, I contriv'd to plant the Mufquets, of which I 
took Notice, that I got feven on Shore out of the Ship 5 
thefe, I fay^ I planted like my Cannon, and fitted them 
into Frames that held them like a Carriage, that fo I 
fcould fire all the feven Guns in two Minutes time: 
This Wall I was many a Weary Month a finifhing, and 
yet never thought my felf fafe till it was dofte. 

When this was done, I {tuck all the Ground without 
my Wall, for a great way every way, as full with Stakes 
or Sticks of the Ojler- like Wood, 'which I found fo apt 
to grow, as they coUld well ftand; infomucb* that I be* 
lieve I might fet in near twenty thoufand of them, leav- 
ing a pretty large Space between them and my Wall, 
that I might have Room to fee an Enemy, and they 
might have no Shelter from the young Trees, if they at* 
tempted to approach my outer Wall. 

ThUs in two Years time I had a thick Grove ; and in 
five or fk Years time I had a Wood before my Dwel- 
ling, grown fo monftrous thick afcd ftrong, that it was 

indeed 



( ^55 ) 

Indeed perfe&ly impaflable ; and no Man, of what kind 
foever, would ever imagine that there was any thing, 
beyond it, much lefs a Habitation: As for the Way 
which I propofed to my felf to go in and out, (for I left 
no Avenue) it was by fetting two Ladders; one to a ParC 
of the Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left 
room t© place another Ladder upon that ; fo when the 
two Ladders were taken down, no Man living couldl 
come down to me without mifchieving Mmfelf ; and if 
they had come down, they were ftiil on the Otitfide of 
my outer Wall. 

Thus I took all the Meafures human Prudence coulct 
fugged: for my own Prefervation ; and it will bee feen at 
length, that they were not altogether without juft Rea- 
fon ; though I foreiaw nothing at that time, more than?' 
my meer Fear fuggefted to me. 

While this was doing, I was not altogether carele& 
of my other Affairs ; for I had a great Concern upon 
ma for my little Herd of Goats ; they were not only & 
prefent Supply to me upon every Occafion, and began, 
to be fufficient to me, without the Expence of Powder 
and Shot, but alfo abated the Fatigue of my Hunting af- 
ter the wild ones $ and I was loth to lofe the Advan- 
tage of them, and to have them all to nurfe up over 
again. 

To this Purpofe, after long Confederation, I could 
think ©f but two Ways to preferve them; one was to* 
find another convenient Place to dig a Cave under 
Ground, and to drive them into it every Night; and 
the othsr was to enclofe two or three little Bits of 
Land, remote from one another, and as much conceal'd 
as I could, where I might keep about half a doien young 
Goats in each Place ; Co that if any Di&fter happen'd 
to the Flock in general, I might be able to raife then* 
again with little Trouble and Time: And this, tho' it 
would require a great deal of Time and Labour, I 
thought was the mod rational De&gn. 

Accordingly, I fpent fome Time to find out the mofl 
retired Parts of the I (land ; and I pitched upon one which 
was as private indeed as my Heart could wifh *, for it 
was a little damp Piece oi Ground in the middle of the 
feoUow m& thick Woods, where, as i& obierv'd, I ap 



( is« ); 

mod loft my felf once before, endeavouring to coma 
back that vyay from the Eaflern Fart of the Ifland :. 
Here I found a clear Hece of Land near three Acres* 
io furrounded with Woods, that it was almoft an En- 
closure by Nature, at lead it did not want, near fo much 
Labour to make it ib, as the other Pieces of Ground I 
had work'd Co hard at. 

I immediately went to work, with this Piece of 
Ground, and in leis than a Month's time, I had Co 
fenced it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it which 
you pleafe, who were not fo wild now as at firft they 
might be fuppofed to be, were well enough fecured in 
if. So without any farther Delay, I removed ten She- 
Croats and two He Goats to this Piece ; and when they 
were there, I continued to per fe A. the Fence till I haa* 
made it as fecure as the other, which, however, I did 
at more Leifure, and it took me up more Time by a 
great deal* 

All this. Labour I was at the Expsnce of^ purely from. 
my Apprehenfr ns on the Account of the iPrint of a 
Man's Foot which I had feen; for as yet I never faw; 
any human Creature come near the Ifland,. and I had 
now liv'd two Years under thefe Uneafineiles, which, 
indeed made my Life much le Is comfortable than it was 
Before; as may well be imagined by any who know 
"svhat it is to live in the conftant Snare of the Fear cf 
Man ; and tliis I mud obferve^ with Grief too, that the 
Difeompofure -of/my Mind had too greatlmprtiHons 
alio upon the religious Part of my Thoughts; for the 
Dread and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages 
and Cnnibals lay Co upon my Spirits, that I feldom found 
my felf in a due Temper for Application to my Maker, 
at lead not -with the fedate Calmnefs and. Refignation. 
of Soul which I was,, wont , to do : I father pray'd to 
God as under great AfEi£Uon and Prefiure of Mind, fur: 
rounded with Danger, and in Expectation every Night 
of being murtherM and devoured before Morning ; andl 
I muft teftUy from my Experience, that a. Temper of 
Peace, Thank ftilnefs, L^ove arid AfFedlion, is much the 
more proper Frame for Prayer than that of Terror and 
IMfcompofure ; and that under the Dre^ad of Mifchief 
impending, a Mm is no more fi| for a comforting Per^ 



(i57> 

fbrmance of the. Duty of praying to God, tlian he is for 
Repentance on a Sick-Bedt : For thefe Difcompofures 
affe& the Mind as. the others do the Body; and theDif- 
co.mpofure of the Mind mull neceflarily be as great, a 
Difability as that of the Body, and much greater, pray- 
ing to God being properly an A& of the Mind, not of 
the Body. 

But to go on ; After I had thus fecur'd one Part of 
my little living Stock, I went about the whole 111 and, 
iearching for another private Place, to make fuch an- 
other Depofit ; when wandring more to the Weft Point 
of the Ifland than I had ever done yet, and looking out* 
to Sea, I thought I faw.a Boat upon the Sea, at a great 
Diftance,.! had found a Perfpe&ive-Glafs, or two, in 
one of the Seamen's Cheft% which I fav'd out of our 
Ship ; but I had it. not about me, and this was (b re- 
mote, that I could not tell what to make of it, though 
1 look'd at it till my Eyes were notable to hold to look 
any longer; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not 
know ; but as I defcended from the Hill, I could fee po 
more of it, lb I gave it over ; only I reiblv'd to go no 
more out without a Perfpeftive-Glafs in my Pocket. 

When I was come down the Hill, to the End of the 
Ifland, where indeed, I had neyer been before, I was 
prefently convinc'd, that the feeing the Print, of a Man's 
Foot, was not fuch ,a ftrange thing in the liland, as I 
irnagin'd ; and but that? it was a fpecial Providence, 
that I was caft upon the Side of the Ifland, where the 
Savages never came, I fhpuld eafily haf e known, that 
nothing was more frequent than for the Canoes from the. 
Main, when they happen'd to be a little too far out at 
Sea, to fhoot over to that Side of the Ifland for Har- 
bour; likewife as they often met, and fought in their 
Canoes, the Vi&ors having taken any Prifoners, would 
bring them over to this Shore, where, according to their 
dreadful Cuftoms, being all CanibaJs y they would kilt 
and eat them : Of which hereafter. 

VVhen I was come down the Hill to the Shore, as t 
fold above, being the S. W. Point, of the Ifland, I was 
perfe&ly confounded and amaz'd ; nor is it poftible for, 
rne to exprefs the Horror of my Mind, at feeing the 
Shore Spread with Skulls, Hands, Feet, and other Bones 

of 



( 158 ) 

*>f human Bodies ; and particularly I obferv*d a Place 
where there had been a Fire made, and a Circle dug in 
the Earth, like a Cock-pit, where it is fuppofed the 
Savage Wretches had fat down to their inhuman Feaft- 
ings upon the Bodies of their Fellow- Creatures . 

I was lb aftonifh'd with the Sight of thefe Things^ 
that I entertain'd no Notions of any Danger to my lelf 
from it, for a longe while; all my Apprehenfions were 
buried in the Thoughts of fuch a Pitch of inhuman, 
hellifh Brutality, and the Hontor of the Degeneracy of 
human Nature ; which tho* I had heard of often, yet I 
never had fo near a View of before ; in ihort, I turned 
away my Face from the horrid Spe£acle; my Stomach 
grew fiek, and I was juft at the Point of Fainting, when 
Nature difcharg'd the Diforder from my Stomach ; 
and having vomited with an uncommon Violence, I 
was a little relieved ; but could not bear to flay in the 
Place a Moment *, fo I got me up the Hill again, with 
all the Speed I could, and walk'd on towards my own 
Habitation. * 

When I came a little out of that Part of the Ifland, 
I flood fKll a while as amax'd ; and then recovering 
my fel£ I look'd up with the utmofl AfFe&ion of my 
Soul, and with a Flood of Tears in my Eyes, gave 
God Thanks that had cad my firfl Lot in a Part of the 
World, where I was diftinguilhed from fuch dreadful 
Creatures as thefe ) and that tho' I had efteem'd my 
prefent Condition very miferable, had yet given me fo 
many Comforts in it, that I had ftill more to give 
Thanks for, than to complain of 5 and this above all, 
that I had, even in this miferable Condition, been 
comforted with the Knowledge of himfelf, and the 
Hope of his BlefHng, which was a Felicity more than 
fufficiently equivalent to all the Mifery which I had 
fuf&r d, or could fuflfer. 

In this Frame of Thank fulnefs, I went Home to my 
Gaftle, and began to be much eafier now, as to the Safe* 
ty of my Circumftances, than ever I was before ; for 
I obferv'd that thefe Wretches never came to this 
Wand in fearch of what they could get; perhaps not 
feeking, not wanting, or not expe&ing any thing here ; 
«ad having often, no doubt^ been up in the cover'd 

woody 



( 159) 



Woody Part of it, without finding anything to their 
Purpofe : I knew 1 had been here now almoft eighteen 
Years, and never faw the lead Footfteps of human 
Creature there before ; and I might be here eighteen 
more as entirely conceaPd as I was now, if I did not 
difcover my felf to them, which I had no manner of 
Oecafion to do, it being my only Bufinefs to keep my 
felf entirely conceaPd where I was, unlefs I found a 
better fort of Creatures than Cam bah to make my felf 
known to. 

Yet I entertain'd fuch an Abhorrence of the fa vage 
Wretches that I have been fpeaking of, and of the 
wretched inhuman Cuftom of their devouring and eat- 
ing one another up, that 1 continued penfive and fad f 
and kept clofe within my own Circle for al mod two 
Years after this : When I fay my own Circle, I mean 
by it, my three Plantations, vi%. my Caflle, my Coun- 
try-Seat, which I call'd my Bower, and my Enclofure 
in the Woods $ nor did I look after this for any other 
Ufe than as an Inclofure for my Goats ; for the Aver- 
fion which Nature gave me to thefe hellifh Wretches, 
was fuch, that I was fearful of feeing them, as of feeing 
the Devil himfelf ; nor did I fo much as go to look af- 
ter my Boat in all this Time; but began rather to think 
of making me another 5 tor I could not think of ever 
making any more Attempts to bring the other Boat 
round the lfland to me, left I fhould meet with fome 
of thefe Creatures at Sea, in which, if I had happen*d 
to have fallen into their Hands, I knew what would 
have been my Lot. 

Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that I 
was in no Danger of being difcover'd by thefe People* 
began to wear off my Uneaftnefs about them; and I be* 
gan to live juft in the fame compos'd Manner as be* 
fore •, onty with this Difference, that I us'd more Cau- 
tion, and kept my Eyes more about me than I did be* 
fore, left I fhould happen to be feen by any* of them ; 
and particularly I was more cautious of firing my Gun* 
left any of them on the lfland, fhould happen to hear 
it ; and it was therefore a very good Providence to 
me, that I had furnlfh'd my felf with a tame Breed 
of Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the 
^ Woods, 



Woods, or moot at s em ; and if I did catch afty of 'em 
after this, it was by Traps and Snares, as I had done 
before ; fo that for two Years after this, I believe I m* 
ver fir'd my Gun once off; tho' I never went out with- 
out it ; and which was more, as I had fav'd three Piftols 
out of the Ship, I always carried 'em out with me, or 
at leaft two of them, clicking them in my Goat- Skin 
Belt ; I aifo furbifh'd up one of the great Cutlafhes, that 
I had'out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on 
alfo ; fo that I was now a mod formidable Fellow to 
look at, when I went abroad if you add to the former 
Defcription of my felf, the Particular of two Piftols, 
and a great broad Sword hanging at my Side in a Belt, 
But without a Scabbard, 

Things going on thus, as I have faid, for fome Time, 
I feem'd, excepting thefe Cautions* to be reduc'd to my 
former calm fedate way of Living, all thefe Things 
tended to fhewingme more and more how far my Con- 
dition was from being miferable, ccmpared to fume o- 
thers; nay, to many other Particulars of Life, which it 
might have pleafed God to have made my Lot. It pat 
me upon refle<5Hng, how little repining there would be 
among Mankind, at any Condition of Life, if People 
would rather compare their Condition with thofe that 
are worle, in order to be thankful, than be always com- 
paring them with thofe which are better to ailiit their 
Murmuriogs and Complainings. 

As in my prefent Condition there were not really 
many Things which I wanted ; fo indeed I thought that 
the Frights I had been in about thefe Savage Wretches 
and the Concern I had been in for my own Prefervati- 
o!?, had taken off the Edge of my Invention for my 
own Conveniences^ and I had dropt a good Defign, 
which I had once bent. my Thoughts upon ; and that 
was to try if F could not make fome of my Barley 
into Malt, and then try to brew my . felf Tome Beer : 
This was really a whimfieal Thought, and 1 reproved 
my felf often for the Simplicity of it; for t prefeutly 
law there would bs the Want of feveral Things necefla/ 
ry to the making my Beer, that it would be impoffible 
for me to fupply : As Firfl, Casks to p refer ve it in, 
which was a Thing that, as I have obier v'd already. 



I could never compafs : no, tho' I fpentlnottnany Day% 
but. Weeks, nay Months, in attempting it, but to no 
pur pole,. In the next place, I had no Hops to make- it 
keep, no Yeaft to make it work, no Copper or Kettle 
to make- it boil; and yet all thefe Things interven'd, . 
I mean the Frights and Terrors I was in about the Sa- 
vages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to 
pals too ; for I feldom gave any Thing over without 
accomplifhing it, when I once had it in my Head enough 
to begin it. 

But my Invention now run quite another Way ; for. 
Night and Day I could think of* nothing but how I 
might deftroy ibme of thefe Monfters in their cruel 
bloody Entertainment, and if poffible, lave the Vi&im 
they Ihouid bring hither to deftroy. It would take up 
a larger Volume than this whole Work is intended to 
be, to fet down all the Contrivances I hatched, "or ra* 
ther brooded upon in my Thoughts, for the deflroying 
thefe Creatures, or at lealt frighting 'em, fo as to pre- 
vent their coming hither, any more ; but all was abor- 
tive, nothing could be poflible to take Effect, unlefs I? 
was to be there to do it my felf ;, and what could one 
Man, do. among, them, when perhaps there might be 
twenty or= thirty of them together, .with their Darts, 
or their Bows aad Arrows, with. which they, could ilioot 
as true to a Mark, as I could with. my. Gun ? 

Sometimes I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the Place 
where they made their Fire, and put in five or fix Pounds 
of Gun-powder, which when they kindled their Fire-,, 
would consequently take Fire, and blow up all that 
was near it ; but as in the firft place I fliould be very 
loth to wafte fo much Powder upon 'em, my Store be- 
ing now within the Quantity of a Barrel,.; fo neither* 
could I be lure of its going off, at any certain time,, 
when it might furprize them, and at heft, that it would 
do little more than juft blow the Fire about their Ears* 
and fright them, but not fufficient to make them for? 
fyke the Place ; fo I laid it afide, and then propos'd, 
that I would place my felf in Ambufh, in fome conveni-, 
fnt Place, with my three Guns, all double loaded ; and 
*o the middle of their bloody Ceremony let fly at 'em, 
When I fhould before to kill or wound perhaps two or 

three 



( xrfa ) 

thret at every flioot ; and then falling in upon them 
•with my three Pillols, and my Sword, I made no doubt 
tut that if there were twenty I Hfould kill them all : 
This Fancy pleas'd my Thoughts for fome Weeks, 
and I was fo full of it, that I often dreamt of it ; 
aad fometimes, that I was juft going to let fly at them 
in my Sleep. 

I went fo far with it in my Imagination, that I em- 
ploy'd my felf feveral Days to find out proper Places to 
put my felf in Ambufcade, as I (aid, to watch for them ; 
and I went frequently to the Place itfel£ which was 
now grown more familiar to me ; and efpecially while 
my Mind was thus fill'd with Thoughts of Revenge, 
and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to 
the Sword, as I may calHt ; but the Horror I had at the 
Place, and at the Signals of the barbarous Wretches 
devouring one another, abated my Malice. 

Weil, at length I found a Place in the Side of the 
Hill, where I was fatisfy'd I might feeurely wait, till 
I faw any o( their Boats coming, and might then, 
even before they would be ready to come on Shore, 
convey my felf unfeen into Thickets of Trees, in one 
of which there was a Hollow large enough to conceal 
me entirely ; and where I might lit, and obferve all 
their bloody Doings, and take my full Aim at their 
Heads, \vhen they were fo clofe together, as that it 
would be next to impoflible that I fhould mifs my 
Shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of 
them at the firft Shoot. 

In this Place then I refolv'd to fix my Defign, and 
accordingly I prepar'd two Muskets, and my ordinary 
Fowling-Piece. The two Muskets I loaded with a 
Brace of Slugs each, and four or five fmafler Bullets, 
about the Size of Piftol-Bullets ; and the Fowling-Piece 
I loaded with near a Handful of Swan-Shot, of the 
iargeft She ; I alfo loaded my Piftols with about four 
Bullets each, and in this Pofture, well provided with 
Ammunition for a fecond and third Charge, I prepaid 
my felf for my Expedition. 

• After I had thus laid the Scheme for my Defign, and 
in my Imagination put it in Practice, I continually 
made my Tour ertry Morning up to the Top of the 

Hill, 



(1*3 ) 

, Hill, which was from my Caille, as I call'd it, about 
three Miles, or more, to fee if I could obferve any 
Boats upon the Sea, coming near the Iiiand, or {landing 
over towards it ; but I began to tire o{ this hard Du- 
ty, after I had for two or three Months constantly 
kept my Watch; but came always back without any 
Diicovery, there having not in all that Time been the 
leail Appearance, not only on, or near the Shore, 
but not on the whole Ocean, fo far as my Eyes or Glaf- 

, fes could reach every Way. 

As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill t© 
look out, fo long alio I kept up the Vigour of my Dc- 
fign, and my Spirits feenfd to be all the while in a fui- 
tabls Frame, for fo outrageous an Execution as the kiU 
ling twenty or thirty naked Savages for an Offence 
which I had not at all enter'd into a Difcufion of in my 
Thoughts, any further than my Paflions were at firft 
fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd at the unnatural Cuf- 
tont of the People of that Country, who it feems had 
been fuflfer'd by Providence, in his wife Difpofition of 
the World, to have no other Guide than that of their 
own abominable and vitiated Pafftons ; and confeciuent- 
ly were left, and perhaps had been fo for lome Ages, to 
a&fuch horrid Things, and receive fuch dreadful Cus- 
toms, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd of Hea- 
ven, and a&ed by fome hellijh Degeneracy, could have 
run them into : But now when, as 1 have faid, I began 
to be weary of the fruitlefs Excurfion which I had made 
fo long, and fo far, every Morning in vain ; {o my Opi- 
nion of the A&ionit felf began to altpr, and I began 
with cooler and calmer Thoughts to consider what it 
was I was going to engage in ; what Authority or Call I 
had, to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon 
thefe Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit 
for fo many Ages to fuffer, unpunifh'd, to go on, and 
to be as it were, the Executioners of his judgments^ 
upon another : Alfo how far thefe People were Offen- 
ders againftme, and what Right had I to engage in the 
Quarrel of that Blood, which they llied promifcuouily 
one upon another : I debated this very often with my 
felf thus, How do I know what God himfelf Judges in 

this 



<■ J 72 > 

this particular Cafe ? It is certain thefe People do not 
commit this as a Crime, it is not againft their own 
Confciences reproving, or their Light reproaching them. 
They do not know it to be an Offence, and then com- 
mit it in defiance of divine Juilice, as we do in almoll 
all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a Crime 
to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do to kill an 
Ox; nor to eat. human Fleih, than we do to eat Mut* 
ton. 

When I had corjfider'd this a little, it followed necefla- 
rily, that I wascertainly in the Wrong in it ; that thele 
People were not Murderers in the Senie that I had be- 
fore condemn' d them in my Thoughts; anymore than 
thofe Chriilians were Murderers, who often put to 
Death the Prifoners taken in Battle, or more frequently, 
upon, many Occailonsy put whole Troops of Men to ths 
Sword, without giving Quarter, tho' they threw down 
their Arms and fubmitted. 

In the next place it occur'd to me, that albeit the 
XJi age they gave one another was thus bruitifh and in* 
human ; yet it was really nothing to me : Thefe People: 
had done me no Injury : That if they attempted me, or 
I faw it neceilary tor my immediate Prefervation to fall 
upon them, fomething might be laid for it ; but that 
I was yet out of their Power, and they had really no 
Knowledg of me, and confequently no Defign upon me ; 
and therefore it could not be juil for me to fall upon 
them. That this would jufKfy the Condu& of the Spa- 
niards in all their Barbarities pra&is'd in America^ where 
they deflroy'd Millions of thefe People, who, however 
they were Idolaters and Barbarians, and had feveral 
Woody and barbarous Rites in their Cuiioms, fuch as 
facrificing human Bodies to their Idols, were yet, as to 
the Spaniards^ very innocent People ; and that the 
rooting 'em out of the Country, is fpoken of with the 
utmoft Abhoranceand Deteftation, by even the Spani- 
ards themlelves c at this- Time, and by all other ChriiH- 
an Nations of Europe, as a mere Butchery, a bloody 
and unnatural piece of Cruelty, unjufHfiaDle either to 
God or Man; and fuch, as for which the very Name 
of a Spaniard h reckoned to he frightful and terrible to. 
ail People* of Humanity, or of Chriftian Companion : 

As 



( 173 ) 



As if the Kingdom of Spam were particularly eminent 
for the Prod uft of a Race of Men, who were without 
Principles of Tendernefs, or the common Bowels of 
Pity to the Miferable, which is reckoned to be a Mark 
of a -generous Temper in the Mind. 

Thefe Conilderations really put me to a Paufe, and 
to a kind of a full Stop ; and I began by little and little 
to be off of my Defign, and to conclude*, I had taken 
wrong Meafures in my Refolutions to -attack the Sava- 
ges ; that it was not my Bufinefs to meddle with 'em, 
unlefs they {{HI attack'd me, and this it was my Bufi- 
■a-fs, if poflible, to prevent; but that if I were diico 
ver'd, and attack'd, then I knew mv Duty. 

On the other hand, I argu'd with my felf, That this 
really was the Way not to deliver my felf, but entirely 
to ruin and deftroy my felf; for unlefs I was fure to 
kill every one that not only fliould be on Shore at that 
Time, but that iliould ever come on Shore afterwards, 
if but one of them efcap'd, to tell their Country-Peo- 
ple what had happen'd, they would come over again by 
Thoufands to revenge the Death of their Fellows and 
I fliould only bring upon my felf a certain Deilruc- 
tion, which at preient I had no manner of Occaflon 
lor. 

Upon the Whole I concluded, that neither in Princi* 
pies nor in Policy I ought one Way or other to concern 
my lelf in this Aff.dr. That my Bufineis was by all 
poflible means to conceal my felf from them, and not 
to leave the lead Signal to them to gueis by, that there 
were any living Creatures upon the Ifland ; I mean of 
human Shape. 

• Religion join'd in with this Prudential, and I was 
convine'd now many Ways, that I was perfectly out of 
my Duty, when I was laying all my bloody Schemes 
for the DeftruAion of innocent Creatures, I mean inno- 
cent as,me: As to the Crimes they were guilty of to- 
wards one another, I bad nothing to with themf ; they 
were National Punifhments to make a juft Retribution • 
for National Offences ; and to bring publick Judgments 
-*ipon thole who offend in a publick Manner, by fuch 
Ways as beft pleafe him. 

This 



This appear'd Co clear to me now, that nothing was 
a greater Satisfaction to me, than that I had not been 
fuifer'd to do a Thing which I now faw Co much Reafon 
to believe would have been no lets a Sin, than that of 
wilful Murther, if I had committed it \ and I gave mo(k 
humble Thanks on my Knees to God, that had thus 
delivered me from Blood-guiltinefs ; befeeching him to 
grant me the Prote&ion of his Providence, that I 
might not fall into the Hands otBarbarians ; or that I 
might not lay my Hands upon them, unlefs I had a 
more clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of 
my own Life. 

In this Difpofltion I continu'd for near a Year after 
this ; and Co tar was I from defiring an Occalion for 
falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all that Time I ne- 
ver once went up the Hill to fee whether there were 
any of them in Sight, or to know whether any of them 
had been on Shore there, or not, that I might not be 
tempted to renew any of my Contrivances againft them, 
or be provoked by any Advantage which might prelent 
it felf to fall upon them ; only this I did, I went and 
removed my Boat, which I had on the other Side the 
Ifland, and carried it down to the Eafl End of the 
whole Ifland, where I ran it into a little Cove, which 
I found under fome high Rocks, and where I knew, by 
reafon of the Currents, the Savages durft not, at leait » 
would not come with their Boats, upon any Account 
whatfoever. 

With my Boat I carried away every Thing that I 
had left there belonging to her, tho 5 not neceffary for 
Che bare going thither, vi\* A Mad and Sail, which I 
had made for her, and a Thing like an Anchor, but in- 
deed which could not be calFd either Anchor or Grap- 
ling ; however, it was the bed I could make of its kind ; 
All thefe I remov'd, that there might not t>e the leaft 
Shadow of any Difcovery, or any Appearance of any 
Boat, or of any human Habitation upon the Ifland. 

Befides this, I kept my felf^ as I faid, more retired 
than ever, and feldom went from my Cell, other than 
upon my conftant Employment, vi%. to mik my She- 
Goats, and manage my little Flock in the Wood ; which, 
as it was quite on the other Part of the Ifland, was 

quite 



(i*7 ) 

quite out of Danger :* For certain it is, that thefe fa- 
rage People, who fometimes haunted this I (land, never 
came with any Thoughts of finding any thing here* 
and confequently never wandred off from the Coaft; 
and I doubt not, but - they might have been feveral 
times on Shore, after my Apprehenfions of them had 
made me cautious,, as well as before ; and, indeed, I 
look'd back with fome Horror upon the Thoughts of 
what my Condition would have been, il I had chop'd 
upon them, and been difcovet'd before that, when naked 
and unarm'd, except with one Gun, and that loaded 
often only with frnall Shot. I walked every where 
peeping, and peiring about the I (land, to fee what I 
could get ; what a Surprize Ihould I have been in, if, 
when 1 difcover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I had in- 
ftead of that feen fifteen or twenty Savages, and found 
them purfuing me, and by the Swiftnefs of their Run- 
ning, no PofTibility of my efcaping them ? 

The Thoughts of this fometimes funk my very Soul 
within me, and diftrefs'd my Mind fo much, that I 
could not foon recover it ; to think what I fhould have 
done, and how I not only ihould not have been able to 
refift them, but even ihould not have had Prefence of 
Mind enough to do what I might have done ; much 
leis, what now after Co much Confideration and Prepa- 
ration I might be able to do: Indeed, after ferious 
thinking of thefe Things, I would be very melancholy, 
and fometimes it would laft a great while ; but I :,*e- 
folv'd it at laft all into Thankfulnefs to that Providence 
w.ich had deliver'd me from fo many unfeen Dangers, 
and had kept me from thofe Mifchiefs which I could 
no way have been the Agent in delivering my felf from ; 
becaule I had not the leaft Notion of any fuch Thing 
depending, or the leaft Suppofition of its being poi : 
fable. 

This renewed a Contemplation, which often had 
come to my Thoughts in former Time, when firft I 
began to fee the merciful Difpofkions of Heaven, in the 
Dangers we run thro* in this Life: How wonderfully 
we are deliver'd, when we know nothing of it. How 
when we are in ( a Quandary , as we call it) a Doubt or 
Hefitation, whether to go this Way, or that Way, a 

fecret 



{ 16% ) / 

Secret Hint fhall dire& us this Way, when we intended 
to go that Way ; nay, when Senie, our own inclina- 
tion, and perhaps Bulinefs has call'd to go the other 
Way, yet a ftrange Impreilion upon the Mind, from we 
know not what Springs, and by we know not what" 
Power, fhall over-rule us to go this Way; and it fhall 
afterwards appear, that had we gone that Way which 
we fhould have gone, and even to our Imagination 
ought to have gone, we ihould have been ruin'd and 
loll : Upon thefe, and ma*ny like Re$e<5Hons, I after- 
wards made it a certain Rule with me, That whenever 
I found thole fecret Hints, or Preffings of my Mind, to 
doing, or not doing any thing that prefented, or to 
going this Way, or that Way, I never faiFd to obsy 
the fecret Dilate ; tho' I knew no other Reafon for it, 
than that fuch a Preffure, or fuch a Hint hung upon my 
Mind : I could give many Examples of the Miccefs of 
this Condu£ in the Courfe of my Life ; but more efpe. 
cially in the latter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy 
Ifland ; befldes many Occafions which it is very likely 
1 might have taken notice of, if I had feen with the 
feme £yes then, that I faw with now : But 'tis never 
too late to be wife; and i cannot but advife all confi- 
dering Men, whofe Lives are attended with fuch extra- 
ordinary Incidents as mine, or even tho 3 not fo extra# 
-ordinary, not to flight fuch fecret Intimations of Pro- 
vidence, let them come from what invifible-InteHigence 
they will, that /I ihall not difcufs, and perhaps cannot 
account tor ; but certainly they are a Proof of the Con* 
verfe of Spirits, and the fecret Communication between 
thofe embody 'd, and thofe 'unembody'd ; and fuch a 
Proof as can never be w it h flood : Of which I ihalrbave • 
Occafion to give fome very remarkable Instances in the 
Hemainder of my folitary Reiidence in this difiiial 
Place. 

I believe the Reader <of this will not think ilrange, 
if I con fefs that thefe Anxieties, thefe conflant Dangers 
I Jiv'd in, and the Concern that was now upon me, 
put an End to all Invention, and to all the Contriv- 
ances' that I had laid for my future Accommodations 
and Conveniences. I had the Care of my 1 Safety more 
mow upon my Hands, tkan that of my Food* I car'd 

not 



( x:*9)v 

not to drive a Nail, or chop a Stick of Wood now, for 
fear the Noife I fhould make ihould be heard 5 much 
lels would I fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon ; and above 
all, I was intolerably uneafy at making any Fire, left 
the Smoak, which is vifible at a great Diftance in the 
Day, fhould betray me ; and For this Reafon I remov'd 
that Part of my Bulinefs which requir'd Fire, fuch as 
burning of Pots and Pipes, Cfr. into my new Apart- 
ment in the Woods ; where, after I had been feme 
Time, I found, to my unfpeakable Coniblation, a mere 
natural Cave in the Earth, which went in a vail way, 
and where, I dare fay, no Savage, had he been at the 
Mouth of it, would be fo hardy as to venture in, nor 
indeed would any Man elfe, but one who, like me, want* 
ed nothing (o much as a fare Retreat. 

The Mouth of this Hollow was at the Bottom of a 
great Rock, where, by mere Accident ( I would fay, 
if I did not fee abundant Reafon to afcribe all fuch things 
now to Providence ) I was cutting down ibme thick 
Branches of Trees, to make Charcoal ; And before I go 
op, I mufl obferve the Reafon of my making this Char- 
coal, which was thus : 

I was afraid of making a Smoak about my Habita- 
tion, as I faid before ; and yet I could not live there 
without baking my Bread, cooking my Meat, $$c. fo I 
, contrived to burn fome Wood here, as I had feen done 
in England under Turf, till it became Chark, or dry 
Coal ; and then putting the Fire out, I preferv'd the 
Coal to carry home, and* perform the other Services, 
which Fire was wanting for, at home, without Danger 
of Smoak. 

But this by the by : White I was cutting down Come 
Wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick 
branch of low Brufh-wood, or Under-wood, there was 
a kind of hollow Place : I was curious to look into it, 
a nd getting with Difficulty into the Mouth of it, I 
found it was pretty large, that is to fay, fufficient for 
me to fland upright in it, and perhaps another with 
me ; ,but I mull confefs to you, 1 made more hafb out 
than I did in, when looking further into the Pkce, 
which was perfe&ly dark, I law two broad ihining Eyes 
°f Ibme Creature, whether Devil or Man, I knew not, 
I wliicii 



( *7° ) 

iWh'icli twinkled like two Stars, the dim Light from the 
Cave's Mouth ihining dire&ly in, and making the Re- 
ik&ion. 

However, after fome Paufe, I recovered my felf, and 
t>egan to call my felf a thoufand Fools, and tell my 
felt, that he that was afraid to fee the Devil, was not 
£t to live twenty Years in an Ifland all alone; and 
that I duril to believe there was nothing in this Cave 
that was more 1 rightful than my ielf ; Upon this, pluc- 
king up my Courage, I took up a great Firebrand, and 
in I rufh'd again, with the Stick ilaming in my 
Hand : I had not gone three Steps in, but I was almoft 
as much frighted as I was before ; for I heard a very 
loud Sigh, like that of a Man inibme Pain, and it was 
follow'd by a broken Noife, as if of Words half ex* 
preis'd, and then a deep Sigh again: I ftep'd back, and 
was indeed ftruck with fuch a Surprize, that it put me 
into a cold Sweat ; and if I had had a Hat on my Head, 
I will not anfwer for it, that my Hair might not have 
lifted it off. But flill plucking up my Spirits as well 
.as I cculd, and encouraging my felf a little, with con* 
ildering that the Power and Prefence of God was e- 
very where, and was able to prote& me ; upon this 1 
ilep'd forward again, and by the Light of the Fire- 
brand, holding it up a little over my Head, I law ly- f 
ing on the Ground a moil: monftrous frightful old He* 
Goat, juft making his Will, as we lay, gafping for Life, 
,and dying indeed of meer old Age. 

I ftir'd him a little, to fee* if I could get him out, 
and he ettay'd to get up, but was not able to raife him* 
felf ; and I thought with my ielf, he might e'en He 
there ; for if he had frighted me- To, he would certainly 
fright any of the Savages, if any of them mould be 
fj hardy as to come in there, while he had any Life 
in him. 

I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and began 
.to look round me, when I found the Cave was out 
very fmall, that is to fay, it might be about twelve 
Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, either round or 
iquare, no Hands having ever been employed in mak- 
ing it, but thofe of meer Nature.: I obferv'd alfo, that 
there was a Place at the further Side of it that went in 

further,

farther, but was fo low, that it required me to creep 
upon my Hands and Knees to go into if, and whether 
it went I knew not \ fo having no Candle, I gave it 
over for ibme time, but refolved to come again the- 
next Day, provided with Candles, and a Tinder-Box^ 
which I had made of the Lock ok one. of the Muskets, 
with fome Wild-fire in the Pan. 

Accordingly, the next Day I came provided with 
fix large Candles of my own making, for I made very 
good Candles now of Goat's Tallow ; and going into 
this low Place, I was obliged to creep upon all Fours, 
as I have laid, almod ten Yards j which, by the way, 
I thought was a Venture bold enough, confidertng 
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was be- 
yond it : When I was get thro 5 the Strait, I found the 
Roof rofe higher up, I believe near twenty Foot; but 
never was fuch a glorious Sight feen in the Ifland, I 
dare fay, as it was, to look round the Sides and Roof 
of this Vault or Cave : The Walls reile&ed a hundred 
thoufand Lights to me from my two Candles ; what it 
was in the Rock, whether Diamonds, or any other pre- 
cious Stones, or Gold, which I rather fuppofed it to 
be, I knew not. 

The Place I was in, was a mod delightful Cavity, or 
Grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, tho' perfe&- 
ly dark ; the Floor was dry and level, and had a fort 
•of imall loofe Gravel upon it ; fo that there was no 
naufeous or venomons Creature to be fcen t neither was 
there any Damp or W T et on the Sides or Roof: The 
only Difficulty in it was the Entrance, which, however, 
as it was a Place of Security, and fuch a Retreat as I 
wanted, I thought that was a Convenience ; fo that I 
was really rejoiced at the Difco very, ' and refolved, 
without any Delay, to bring fome of tho fe> things which 
I was moft anxious about, to this Place; /particularly, 
J refolv'd to bring hitlier my Magazine of Powder, and 
all my fpa/e Arms, vl^* Two Fowling-Pieces, (fori 
had three in all ) and three M«sket», (for of them I had 
«ight in all ) fo I kept at my Caftle only five, which 
ftood ready mounted, like Pieces oi Cannon, on my 
outmoft Fence ; and were ready alfo to take out upon 
" a ny Expedition.

( i7» ) 

Upon this Occafion of removing my Ammunition^ 
I was oblig'd to open the Barrel of Powder which I 
took up out of the Sea, and which had been wet ; and 
I found that the Water had penetrated about three or 
lour Inches into the Powder on every fide, which ca- 
king and growing hard, had preferved the Infide like a 
Kernel in a Shell ; To that I had near fixty Pounds of 
very good Powder in the Centre of the Cask ; and this 
was an agreeable Difcovery to me at that time ; fo I 
carried all away thither, never keeping above two or 
three Pounds of Powder with me in my Caflle, for 
fear of a Surprize of any kind : I alfo carried thither all 
the Lead I had left for Bullets. 

I fancied my felf now like one of the ancient Giants, 
"which were laid to live in Caves and Holes in the 
Rocks, where none could come at them ; for I per- 
iwaded my felf, while I was here, if five hundred 
Savages w r ere to hunt me, they could never find me 
out ; or if they did, they would not venture to attack 
me here. 

The old Goat, who I found expiring, died in the 
Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after I made this 
Difcovery # , and I found it much eafler to dig a great 
Hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with 
Earth, than to drag him out : So I interr'd him there, 
to prevent Offence to my Nofe. 

I was now in my twenty-third Year of Refidence in 
this I Hand, and was fo naturalized to the Place, and 
to the Manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed 
the Certainty, that no Savages would come to the 
Place to difturb me, I could have been content to 
have capitulated for fpending the reft of myTime there, 
even to the laft Moment, till I had laid me down and 
died, like the old Goat in the Cave : I had alfo ar- 
rived to ibme little Diverfions and A mufements, which 
made the Time pafs more pleafantly with me a great 
deal than it did before ; at firft, I had taught my Pott, 
as I noted before, to fpeak ; and he did it fo familia r- 
ly, and talk'd fo articulately and plain, that it was 
very pleafant to me \ and he lived with me no leis 
than fix and twenty Years: How long he might live 
afterwards, I know not \ tho' I know they have a No-

tion in the Brafils> that they live a hundred Years; 
perhaps feme of my Polls may be alive there flill, calling 
after Poor Robin Oufoe to this Day ; I with no EngUJb- 
tnan the ill Lu:k to come there and hear them, but if he 
did, he would certainly believe it was the Devil. My 
Dog was a very pleafant and loving Companion to me 
for no lels than fixteen Years of my Time, and then 
died of meer old Age •, as for my Cats, they multiply- 
ed, as I have obferved, to that degree, that I was obliged 
to fhoot feveral of them at firit, to keep them from de- 
vouring me and all I had ; but at length, when the 
tvvo old ones I brought with me were gone, and after 
lome time continually driving them from me, and let- 
ting them have no Provillon with me, they all ran 
wild into the Woods, except two or three Favourites, 
which I kept tame, and whole Young, when they had 
any, I always drown'd, and thefe were part of my 
Family : Befides thefe, I always kept two or three 
Houfhold Rids about me, which I taught to feed out 
of my Hand ; and I had alio more Parrots, which 
talk'd pretty well, and would all call Robin Crufoe y but 
none like my firft ; nor indeed, did I take the Pains 
with any o^them that I had done with him : I had alio 
feveral tame Sea-Fowls, whofe Names I know not, 
which I caught upon the Shore, and cut their 'Wings; 
and the little Stakes which I had planted before my Ca- 
ftle-Wall, being now grown up to a good thick Grove, 
thefe Fowls all lived among thefe low Trees, and bred 
there, which was very agreeable to me; lb that, as I 
faid above, I began to be very well contented with the 
Life I led, if it might but have been fecured from the 
Dread of the Savages. 

But it was otherwife dire&ed ; and it may not be a- 
mifsfor all People who fhall meet with my Story, to 
make this juft Obfervation from it, vi\. How frequently, 
in the Courfe of our Lives, the Evil which in it felf 
we feek mod to fhun, and which, when we are fallen 
into, is the moft dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very 
means or door of our Deliverance, by which alone we 
can be rais'd again from the AfflidKon we are fallen into; 
I could give many Examples of this in the Courfe of my . 
Unaccountable Life \ but in nothing was it more parti-. 

I 3 cularly 



( 174 ) 



Ctflarly remarkable than in the Circumflances of my 
lail Years of folitary Refidence in this I (land. 

It was now the Month of December, as I faid above,, 
in ray twenty-third Year ; and this being, the Ibuthern 
Solilice, for Winter I cannot call it, was the particular 
Time of my Harveft, and required my being pretty 
much abroad in the Fields ; when going out pretty 
early in the Morning, even before it was thorow Day- 
light, I was furpriz'd with feeing a Light of fome Fire 
upon the Shore, at a diftance from me, of about two 
Miles, towards the end of' the I Hand, where I had ol> 
lerved fome Savages had been, as before ; but not on the 
ether Side, but to my great Affli&ion, it was on my 
Side of the Ifland. 

I was indeed terribly furpriz'd at the Sight, and ftopt 
jQiort within my Grove, not daring to go out left: I 
might be furprii'd ; and yet I had no more Peace with- 
in, trom my Apprehenfions I had, that if theie Savages, 
in rambling over the ifland, fhould find my Corn 
Handing, or cut, or any of my Works and Improve- 
ments, they would immediately conclude, that there 
were People in the Place, and would then never give 
©ver till they found me out : In this Extremity I went 
back direclly to my Cattle, pulfd up the Ladder after 
me, having made all things without look as wild and- 
natural as I could. 

Then I prepared my felf within, putting my felf in 
a Poflure of Defence ; I loaded all my Cannon, as I 
calPd them ; that is to fay, my Muskets, which were 
mounted upon my new Fortification, and all my Piftols 
and refolv'd to defend my felf to the la ft Gafp ; not 
forgetting ferioufly to commend my felf to the divine 
Prote&ion, and earneftly to pray to God to deliver me 
out of the Hands of the Barbarians ; and" in this Pof- 
ture I continued about two Hours, but began to be migh- 
ty impatient for Intelligence abroad, for I had no Spies 
to fend out. 

After fitting a while longer, and mufing what t 
ihould do in this Cafe, I was not able to bear fitting in 
Ignorance any longer ; fb letting up my Ladder to the 
fide of the Hill, where there was a flat Place, as I ob- 
ferved before, and then pulling the Ladder up afte* 

me> 



( 175 ) 

JWe, I let {tup again, and mounted to theTop'of the I\IIII; : 
and pulling out my Perfpe&ive-Ghfs, which i had ta- 
ken, on purpofe, I laid me down flat on mv Belly on- 
the Ground, and began to look for the Place: I pre- 
fently found there were no lefs than nine naked Savages 
fitting round a (mail Fire, they had made ; not to wajrm 
them, for they had no need of that, the Weather being 
extreamhot; but, as I fuppos'd, to drefs ibme of tjieir 
barbarous Diet of human Flefh, which they had 
brought with them, whether alive or dead, I could not 
know. 

They had two Canoes with them, which they ha<L 
haled up upon the Shore ; and as it was then Tide of 
Hbb, they feem'd to me to wait for the Return of the 
Flood, to go away again ; it is not eafy to imagine 
what Confufion this Sight put me into, efpecially fee- 
ing them come on my fide the Ifland, and fo near me 
too ; but when I obferv'd their coming mud be al- 
ways with the Current of the Ebb, I began afterwards 
to be more fedate in my Mind, being fatisfy'd that I 
might go abroad with fafety all the Time of the Tide 
of Flood, if they were not on Shore before ; And ha- 
ving made this Obfervation, I went abroad about my 
Harveft-Work with the more Compofure. 

As I expe&§d, fo it proved^ for as foon as the Tide 
made to the Weft ward, I law them all take Boat, and 
row Cor paddle, as we call it J all away .* I fhould have 
obferv'd, that for an Hour and more before they went 
off 7 , they went to dancing, and I could eafily difcern 
their Poftures and Geftures by my GlafTes : I could not 
perceive, by my niceft Obfervation, but that they were 
ftark naked, and had- not the leaft Covering upon them} 
But whether they were Men or Women, that I could 
not diftinguifh. 

As foon as I faw them fhip'd and gone, I took two 
Guns upon my Shoulders, and two Piftols at my Gir- 
dle, and my great Sword by my fide, without a Seab- 
oard, and with all the Speed I was able to make, I 
went away to the Hill, where I had difcover'd the iirft 
Appearance of all; As foon as I got thither, which 
was not lefs than two Hours, (for I could not go apace 
being.. fo loaden with Arms as I was) I perceiv'd there 

I 4 had 



( 17* ) 

had been three Canoes more of Savages on that Place J 
and looking out further, I faw they were all at Seato- 
gcther, making over for the Main. 

This was a dreadful Sight to me, efpecially when 
going down to the Shore, I could fee the Marks of 
Horror which the difmal Work they had been about had 
left behind it, vi\* the Blood, the Bones, and Part of 
the Fleili of human Bodies, eaten and devoured by 
thofe Wretches, with Merriment and Sport ; I was fo 
iiird with Indignation at the Sight, that I began now 
to premeditate the DeftriuStion of the next that I law 
there, let them be who or how many ibever. 

it feem'd evident to me, that the Vifits which they 
thus made to this liland, were not very frequent \ for it 
was above fifteen Months before any more of them 
came on Shore there again ; that is tofay y I never law 
them, or any Footiteps, or Signals of them, in all that 
Time ; for as to the rainy Seafons, then they are lure 
not to come abroad, at lead not fo far ; yet all this 
while I lived uncomfortably, by reafon of the conftant 
A pprehenfions I was in of their coming upon me by 
fur prize j from whence I bbferve, that the Expectation 
of Evil is more bitter than tke Suffering, efpecially 
if there i§ no room to ihake off that Expectation, or 
thofe Apprehenflons. 

During all this time, I was in the murthering Hu- 
mour ; and took up mofl of my Hours, which fhould 
have been better enfployed,in contriving how to circum- 
vent and fall upon them the very next time I fhould fee 
them \ efpecially if they fliould be divided, as they 
were the lafl time, into two Parties; nor did I confi- 
der at all, that if I kill'd one Party, fuppofe ten or a 
dozen, I was ftill the next Day, or Week, or Month, 
to kill another, and ib y another, even ad infinitum^ till 
I fhould be at length no lefs a Murtherer than they 
were in being Man-eaters, and perhaps much more 
fo. 

I fpent my Days now in great Perplexity and An* 
xiety of Mind, expe&ing that I fhould one Day or o- 
ther fall into the Hands of thefe merciiefs Creatures; 
if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not 
without looking round me with the greateft Care and 

Caution 



( 177 ) * 

Caution imaginable ; and now I found to my great 
Comfort, bow happy it was that I had provided tor a 
tame Flock or Herd of Goars ; for I durft not upon any 
account fire my Gun, efpecially near that fide of the 
I Hand where they uiually came, left I fhould alarm the 
Savages ; and if they had fled from me now, I was fure 
to have them come back again, with perhaps two or 
three hundred Canoes with them in a few Days, and 
then I knew what to expedt. 

However, I w r ore out a Year and three Months more, 
before I ever law any more of the S avages, and then 
I found them again, as I fhall foon obferve : It is true, 
they might have been there once or twice ; but either 
they made no Stay, or at leaft, I did not bear them ; 
but in the Month of May, as near as I could calculate, 
and in my four and twentieth Year, I had a very ftrange 
Encounter with them, of which in its Place. 

The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fifteen or 
iixteen Months Interval, was very great ; I flept un- 
quiet, dreamt always frightful Dreams, and often Part- 
ed out of my Sleep in^the Night: In the Day great 
Troubles overwhelmed my Mind, in the Night I dreamt 
often of killing the Savages, and the Reafons why I 
might juftify the doing of it : But to wave all this for a 
while; it was in the middle of May, on the fixteenth 
Day I think, as well as my poor wooden Calendar 
would reckon ; for I mark'd all upon the Pofl ftill ; I 
fay, it was on the fixteenth of May, that it blew a very 
great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great deal of 
Lightning and Thunder, and a very foul Night it was 
after it : 1 know not what was the particular occafioit 
of it ; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up 
with ferious Thoughts about my prefent Condition, I 
was furprix'd with the Noife of a Gun, as I thought, 
iir'd at Sea. 

This was to be fure a Surprize of a quite different 
Nature from any I had met with before ; for the No- 
tions this put into my Thoughts were quite of another 
kind ; I ftarted up in the greateft Hafle imaginable, 
and in a trice clapt my Ladder to the middle Place of 
the Rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the 
ftcond Time, got to the Top of the Hill -, that very Mo. 

I $ mens 



( *78 ) 

merit a Flaili of Fire bid me liften for a fecond Gur% 
which accordingly, in about halt* a Minute, I heard, 
and. by the Sound knew that it was from that Part of 
the Sea where I was driven out with the Current in 
Boat. 

I immediately confider'd that this mu ft be fome Ship- 
in Diflrefs, and that they had fome Comrade, or fome 
other Ship in Company, and fir'd thefe Guns for Sig- 
nals of Diftrefs, and to obtain Help : I had this Pre- 
sence of Mind at that Minute, as to think, that tho 5 
I could not help them, it may be they might help me; 
fo I brought together all the dry Wood 1 could get at 
hand, and making a good handfome Pile, I let it on 
Fire upon the Hill ; the Wood was dry, and blaz'd free- 
ly, and tho 5 the Wind blew very hard, yet it burnt 
iairly out, fo that I was certain, if there was any fuch 
Thing as a Ship, they muft needs fee it, and no doubt 
they did, for as-, loon as ever my Fire blaz'd up, I heard ' 
another Gun, and after that feveral others, all from the 
lame Quarter : I ply'd my Fire all Night long, till 
Day broke •, and when it was broad Day, and the Air 
elear'd up, I faw fomething at a great Diftance at Sea, 
full Eaft of the I Hand, whether a Sail, or a Hull, I 
could not difKnguifh, no not with my GlafTes, the 
Diftance was fo great, and the Weather dull fomething 
hazy alfo ; at lead it was fo out at Sea. 

I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and foon per- 
ceived that it di<J not move ; fo I prefently concluded 
that it was a Ship at an Anchor ; and being eager, you 
may be fure, to be fatisfy'd, I took my Gun in my 
Hand, and ran toward the South. Eaft Side of the Ifland, 
to the Rocks where I had formerly been ca ry'd away 
•with the Current, and getting up there, the 'Weather 
by this Time being perfe&ly clear, I could plainly fee, 
to my great Sorrow, the Wreck of a Ship eaft: away 
in the Night upon thofe concealed Rocks which I found 
ivhen I was out in my Boat ; and which Rocks, as they 
check'd the Violence of the Stream, and made a kind 
of Counter-Stream or Eddy, were the Occafion of my 
recovering then from the moil defperate hopelefi Condi- 
tion that ever I had been in in all spy Life. 

Thus| 



Thus, what is one Man's Safety, is another ManY 
Deftru&ion ; for it feems thefe Men, whoever they 
were, being out of their Knowledge, and the Rocks be- 
ing wholly under Water, had been driven upon them 
in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E. 
Had they feen the I (land, as I mufl necelTarily fuppofe 
they did not, they mull, as I thought, have endea- 
voured to have fav'd themfelves on Shore by the Help 
of their Boat ; but their firing oiFGuns for Hdp, efpe- 
cially when they law, as I imagin'd, my Fire, filled 
me with many Thoughts : Firll I imagin'd, that upon 
feeing my Light, they might have put themfelves into 
their- Boat, and have endeavour'd to make the Shore, 
but that the Sea going very high, they might have 
been call away ; other times I imagin'd, that they 
might have loll their Boat before, as might be the 
Cafe many ways ; as particularly, by the breaking of 
the Sea upon their Ship, which many times obliges 
Men to Have, or take in pieces their Boat •> and fome- 
times to throw it over Board with their own. Hands : 
Other times I imagin'd, they had fome other Ship of 
Ships in Gqmpany, who, upon the Signals of Dillrefs 
they had made, had taken them up and carried them 
©ft : Other whiles I fancied, they were all gone off to 
Sea in their Boat, and being hurried away by the 
Current that I had been formerly in, were carry'd out 
into the great Ocean where there was nothing but Mir 
fery and Perjfhing ; and that perhaps, they might by 
this Time think of flarving, and of being in a Condi- 
tion to eat one another. 

As all thefe were but Conjectures at belt, fo in the 
Condition I was in, I could do no more than look on 
upon the Miiery oi the poor Men, and pity them ; 
which had dill this good EfFeft on my Side, that it 
gaye me more and more Caufe to give Thanks to 
God, who had fo happily and comfortably provided 
for me in my defolate Condition ^and that of two Ships 
Cqmpanies who were now call away upon this Part 
of the World, not one Life fhould be fpar'd but mine,: 
I learnt here again to oblferve, that it is very rare that 
the Providence of God calls us into any Condition of 
Lite fo low, or any Mifery fo grea r , but we may lee 
: ;■ " ~ ibme- 



(i8o)< . 

fomething or other to be thankful for ; and may fee o- 
thers in worfe Circumitances than our own. 

Such certainly was the Cafe of thefe Men, of whom 
I could not fo much as fee Room to fuppofe any of 
them were fav'd ; nothing could make it rational, fo 
much as to wifh or expe& that they did not all periili 
there, except the PoiTibility only of their being taken 
up by another Ship in Company: And this was but 
mere Poffibility indeed ; for I faw not the lead Signal 
or Appearance of any fuch Thing. 

I cannot explain, by any pomble Energy of Words, 
-what a ftrange Longing or Hankering of Defires I felt 
in my Soul upon this Sight ; breaking out fometimes 
thus ; O that there had been but one or two, nay, or 
"but one Soul fav'd out of the Ship, to have efcap'd to 
Bie, that I might but have had one Companion, one 
Fellow-Creature to have fpoken to me, and to have 
conversed with! In all the Time of my folitary Life, 
I never felt fo ear neft, fo ftrong a Deiire after the So- 
ciety of my Fellow-Creatures, or fo deep a Regret at 
the Want of it. 

There are fome fecret moving Springs in the Affec- 
tions, which, when they are let a-going by fome Ob- 
je& in View, or be it fome Object, though not in View, 
yet render'd prefent to tbe Mind by the Power of Ima- 
gination, that Motion carries out the Soul by its Im- 
pjtuofity to fuch violent, eager Embracings of the Ob- 
ject, that the Ablence of it is infupportable. 

Such were thefe earned Wifliings, That but one Man 
bad been fav'd ! that it had been but One ! I believe 
I repeated the Words, that it had been but One ! a 
thoufand times \ and the Defires were fo mov'd by it, 
that when I fpoke the Words, my Hands would clinch 
together, and my Fingers prefs the Palms of my Hands, 
that if I had had any foft Thing in my Hand, it would 
have crufhM it involuntary ; and my Teeth in my Head 
would ft rike together, and fet againft one another fo 
iirong, that for fome time T could not pattthem 
again. 

Let the Naturalifts explain thefe Things, and the 
Reafon and Manner of them ; all I can fay of them, is, 
to defcribe the Fa&> which was eves furprizing to me 

when 



when I found it, tho' I knew not from what it fhould 
proceed ; it was doubtlefs the EfFed of ardent Wifhes, 
and of ftrong Ideas form'd in my Mind, realizing the 
Comfort which the Converfation of one of my Fellow- 
Chriftians would have been to me. 

But it was not to be ; either their Fate, or mine, or 
both, forbid it ; for till the laft Year of my being on 
this I Hand, I never knew, whether any were fav'd out 
of that Ship or no ; and had only the Affii&ion fome 
Days after, to fee the Corps of a drown'd Boy come 
on Shore, at the End of the Ifland, which was next 
the Shipwreck : He had on no Cloaths, but a Seaman's 
Waftcoat, a Pair of open knee'd Linnen Drawers,, and 
a blue Linnen Shirt ; but nothing to direct me fo much 
as to guefs what Nation he was of : He had nothing in 
his Pocket but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobacco- 
Pipe ; the laft was to me of ten times more Value than 
the firft. 

It was now calm, and I had a great Mind to venture 
out in my Boat to this Wreck ; not doubting but I 
might find fomething on Board, that might be uferul 
to me ; but that did not altogether prefs me fo much, 
as the Poffibility that there might be yet fome living 
Creature on Board, whole Life i might not only fave, 
but might, by faving that Life, comfort my own' to 
the laft Degree j and this Thought clung fo to mp 
Heart, that I could not be quiet, Night or Day, but 
I mufl venture out in my Boat on Board this Wreck ; 
and committing the reft to God's Providence, I thought 
the Impreffion was fe flrong upon my Mind, that it 
could not be refitted, that it.muft come from fome ^vi- 
fible Dire&ion, and that I fhould be wanting to my 
felf, if I did not go. 

Under the Power of this Impreffion, I haften'd back 
to my Gaflle, prepar'd every Thing for my Voyage, 
took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot for frefli Wa* 
ter, a Compafs to (leer by, a Bottle of Rum^ ( for I had 
ftiil a great deal of that left j a Basket full of Raifins : 
And thus loading my felf with every thing neceffary, I 
went down to my Boat, got the' Water out of her, and 
got her afloat, loaded all my Cargo in her, and then 
went Home again for more i My Jeeond Cargo was a 

great 



(i8 2 > 

great Bag full of Rice, the Umbrella to fct up over my. 
Head for Shade, another large Pot full of freih Water, 
and about two Dozen of my {mall Loaves, or Barley 
Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of Goat's Milk, 
and a Cheefe ; all which, with great Labour ^and Sweat, 
I brought to my Boat, and praying to God to diretf: 
*ny Voyage,. I put out, and rowing or paddling the- 
Canoe along the Shore, I came at laft to the utmoft 
Point of the Ifland, on that-Side, ( vi\. ) N. E. And 
now 1 was to launch out into the Ocean, and either 
to venture, or not to venture ; I look'd on the rapid. 
Currents which ran conftantly on both Sides of the* 
Ifland, at a Diftance, and which were very terrible to 
me, from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been 
in beforehand my Heart began to fail me; fori fore- 
faw that if I was driven into either of thofe Currents, 
I ihould be carried a vaft Way out to Sea, and perhaps 
out of my Reach, or Sight of the Ifland again ; and that 
then, as my Boat was but fmall, if any little Gale of 
Wind fhould rife, I Ihould be inevitably loft. 

Thefe Thoughts fo opprefs'd my Mind, that I be- 
gan to give over my Enterprise, and having haled my 
Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I ftept out, and 
fat me down upon a little rifing bit of Ground, very 
penfive and anxious, between Fear and Defire about 
my Voyage ; when, as I was muflng, I could perceive 
that the Tide was turn'd and the Flood came on, upon 
which my going was for fo many Hours inappli- 
cable: Upon this prefently it occur'd to me, that I 
ihould go up to the higheft Piece of Ground I coul4 
iind, and obferve, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide 
or Currents lay, when the Flood came in, that I might 
judge whether, if I was driven one Way out, I might 
not expe& to be driven another W T ay home,, with the 
fame Rapidnefs of the Currents: This Thought; was no 
fooner iii my Head, but 1 cafl: my Eye upon a little 
Hill, which fufficiently overlooked the Sea both way s> 
and from whence I had a clear View of the .Currents, 
or Sets of the Tide, and which Way I was to guide

rent of the Ebb fet cut clofe by the South Point of the

Shore 



'(i8 3 ) 

lure of the North Side, and that I had nothing, to i® 
hut to keep to the North of the Ifland in my Return, 
and I ihould do well enough. 

Encourag'd with this Obiervation, I refolv'd the next 
Morning to fet out with the firfl of the Tide ; and re- 
peeing my felf for that Night in the Canoc> under the 
great Watch-Coat I mention'd, I launch' d out : I made 
Ml a little out to Sea full North, till I began to feel 
the Benefit of the Current, which fet Eaftward, and 
which carried me at a great Rate, and yet did not fo 
hurry me as the Southern Side Current had done before, 
and fo as to take from me all Government of the Boat; 
but having a ftrong Steerage with my Paddle, I went, 
Ifay, at a great Rate, dire&ly for the Wreck, and in lefs 
than two Hours I came up to it. 

It was a difmal Sight to look at: The Ship, which 
by its Building was Spawjh, (luck fad, jaum'd in be- 
tween two Rocks ; all the Stern and Quarter of her was 
beaten to Pieces with the Sea •, and as her Forecaftle, 
which fluck in the Rocks, had run on with great Vio- 
lence, her Mainmafl: and Foremafl were brought by the 
Board, that is to fay, broken fhort off} but her Bolt- 
fprit was found, and the Head and Bow appear'd firm: 
When I came clofe to her, a Dog appear'd upon her, 
who feeing me coming, yelp'd and cry'd, and as foon 
as I call'd him, jump'd into the Sea, to come to me, 
and 1 took him into the Boat, but found him almoft 
dead for Hunger and Thirft: I gave him a Cake of 
my Bread, and he eat it like a ravenous Wolf^ that had 
been ftarving a Fortnight in the Snow: I then gave the 
poor Creature fome freih Water, with which, ifl would 
fiave let him, he would have burft himfelf. 

After this I went on Board; The £r(l Sight I 
met with, was two Men drown'd y& the Cook-Room, 
or Forecaftle of the Ship, with their Arms fad about 
one another : I concluded, as is indeed probable, that 
when the Ship ftruck, it being in a Storm, the Sea 
broke fo high, and h continually over her, that the 
Men were not able to bear it, and were ftrangled with 
the conftant rufliing in of the Water, as much as if they 
had been under Water : Befides the Dog, there was 
nothing left in the Ship that had Life, nor any Goods 

thfit 



' ' ■ ( «4 ) 

that I could fee, but what were fpoiFd by the Water : 
There were fome Casks of Liquor, whether Wine or 
Brandy, I knew not, which lay lower in the Hold, and 
which, the Water being ebb'd out, I could fee, but 
they were too big to meddle with : I faw feveral Chefts, 
which I believ'd belong' d to fome of the Seamen, and 
I got two of them into the Boat, without examining 
what was in them. 

Had the Stern oi the Ship been fix'd, and the Fore- 
part broken off, I am perfwaded I might have made a 
good Voyage*, for by what I found in thefe two Chefts, 
1 had room to fuppofe the Ship had a great deal oi 
Wealth on Board ; and if I may guefs by the Courfe 
fhe fteer'd, fhe mull have been bound from the Buenos 
AkeSy or the Rio de la Plata, in the South-Part of Ame- 
rica, beyond the Brafils, to the Havana, in the Gulph 
of Mexico, and fo perhaps to Spain : She had, no doubt, 
a great Treafure in her, but of no Ufe at that time to 
any Body ; and what became of the reft of her People, 
I then knew not. 

I found, befides thefc Chefts, a little Cask full of 
Liquor, of about twenty Gallons, which I got into my 
Boat, with much Difficulty: There were feveral Mus- 
kets in a Cabbin, and a great Powder-Horn, with a- 
bout four Pounds of Powder in it; as for the Muskets, I 
had no occafion for them, fo I left them, but took the 
Powder-Horn : I took a Fire-fhovel and Tongs, which 
I wanted extremely *, as alfo two little Brafs- Kettles, a 
Copper-Pot to make Chocolate, and a Gridiron ; and 
with this Cargo, and the Do& I came away, the Tide 
beginning to make home again ; and the fame Eve. 
ning, about an Hour within Night, I reached the Ifland 
again, weary and fatigu'd to the laft Degree. 

I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morn- 
ing I refolv'd to harbour what I had gotten in my new 
Cave, not to carry it home to my Caitle : After re- 
freihing my felfj I got all my Cargo on Shore, and be- 
gan to examine the Particulars : The Cask of Liquor I 
found to be a kind of Rum, but not fuch as we had at 
the Brafils ; and in a Word, not at all good ; but when 
I came to open the Chefts, I found feveral things of 
great Uie to me; For Example, I found in one a fine 

Cafe 



( x8 5 ) - 

Cafe of Bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and fillet 
with. Cordial Waters, fine, and very good ; the Bot- 
ties held about three Pints each, and were tip'd with 
Silver: I found two Pots of very good Succades, or 
Sweetmeats, fo fafteu'd alio on Top, that the fait Wa- 
ter had not hurt them ; and two more of the fame* 
which the Water had fpoil'd: I found fome very good 
Shirts, which were very welcome to me, and about a 
doien and a half or Linnen white Handkerchiefs, and 
coloured Neckcloths ; the former were alfo very wel- 
come, being exceeding refrefhing to wipe my Face in a 
hot Day ; befides this, when I came to the Till in the 
Cherts, I found there three great Bags of Pieces of Eight, 
which held about eleven hundred Pieces in all ; and in 
one of them, wrapt up in a Paper, fix Doubloons of 
Gold, and fome fmall Bars or Wedges of Gold \ I fup- 
pofe they might all weigh near a Pound. 

The other Chert; I found had fome Cl oaths in it, but 
of little Value ; but by the Circumftances it muft have 
belong'd to the Gunner's Mate, tho' there was no Pow- 
der in it 3 but about two Pounds of fine glax*d Powder, 
in the three fmall Flasks, kept, I. fuppofe, for charg- 
ing their Fowling-pieces on occafion : Upon the whole, 
I got very little by this Voyage, that was of any ufe 
to me ; f or as to the Money, I had no manner of occa- 
fion for it \ 'twas to me as the Dirt under my Feet \ and 
I would have given it all for three or four Pair of 
EngUJh Shoes and Stockings, which were things I great- 
ly wanted, but had not had on my Feet now for many 
Years : I had, indeed, gotten two Pair of Shoes now, 
which I took off of the Feet of the two drown'd Men, 
who I faw in the Wreck ; and I found two Pair more 
in one of the Cherts, which were very welcome to me \ 
but they were not like our Englijh Shoes, either for 
Eafe or Service, being rather what we call Pumps than 
Shoes : I found in this Seaman's Chert: about fifty 
Pieces of Eight in Royals, but no Gold ; I fuppofe this 
belong'd to a poorer Man than the other, which feem'd 
to belong to fome Officer. 

Well, however, I lugged this Money home to my 
Cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before, which 
I brought from our own Ship j but it j was great Pity, 

'. • » 



( i8<? ) 

4fsl faid, thatth? other Part of this Ship had not come* 
to my Share, for I am fatisfied I might have loaded my 
Canoe feveral times over with Money, which, if I had 
ever efcap'd to England, would have lain here fafe 
enough till I might have come again and fetch'dit. 

Having now brought all my Things on Shore, and 
fecurM.them, I went back to my Boat, and row'd or 
paddled her along the Shore to her old Harbour, where 
I laid her up, and made the beftofmy Way to my 
old Habitation, where I found every Thing Fafe and 
quiet ; £o I began to repofe myielf, live after my old 
Fafliion, and take care of my Family Affairs; and for 
z while I lived eafy enough ; only that I .was more vi- 
gilant than I usM to be^ look'dout oftner, and did not 
go abroad Co much ; and if at any time I did ftir with 
any Freedom, it was always to the Eaft Part of the 
Iiland, where I was pretty well iatisfy'4 the Savages 
Kever came, and where I could go without fo many 
Precautions, and fuch a Load of Arms and Ammunition, 
as I always carry'd with me, if I went the other Way. 

I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more ; but 
itiy unlucky Head, that was always to let me know it 
was born to make my Body miferable, was all thofe two 
Years fill'd with Proje&s and Deiigns how, if it were 
poflible, I might get away from this Ifland ; forfome- 
tirnes I was for making another Voyage to the Wreck, 
tho' my Reafoi: told me that there was nothing left there 
worth the Hazard of my Voyage : Sometimes for a 
Ramble one way, Sometimes another; and I believe ve- 
rily, if I had had the Boat that I went from Salle e in> 
I fhould have ventur'd to Sea, bound any where, I 
knew not whether. 

I have been, in all my Circumftances, a- Memenft 
to thofe who are touch'd with that general Plague of 
Mankind, whence, for ought I know, one half of their 
Miferies flow ; i mean, that of not being fatisfy'd with 
the Station wherein God and Nature hath plac'd them ; 
for not to look back upon my primitive Condition, and 
the excellent Advice of my Father, the Oppofition to 
which was, as 1 may call if, my Original Sin, my fubfe- 
quent Miftakes of the fame kind had been the means of 
*ny coming.into this niUerable Condition j for had that 

Pro* 



( 1*7 ) y 

Providence, which to happily had feated me at the Bra* 
[ils, as a Planter, blefs'd me with confin'd Deflres, and I 
could have been contented to have gone on gradually^ 
I might have been by this Time, / mean in the Time 
of my behg in this I/land, one of the mod conflderable 
Planters in the Braflls^ nay, I am perfuaded, that by 
the Improvements I had made in that little time I liv'd 
there, and the Encreafe I fhould probably have made, 
if I had ftay'd, I might have been worth an hundred 
thoufand Moydores ; and what Bufinefs had I to leave 
a fettled Fortune, a well-flocked Plantation, improv- * 
ing and increafing, to turn Supra Cargo to Guinea, to 
fetch Negroes, when Patience and Time would have 
fo encreas'd our Stock at Home, that we could have 
bought them at our own Door, from thofe whofe Bu- 
fineisit was to fetch them? And though it hadcoftus 
fo me thing more, yet the Difference of that Price was 
by no Means worth faving at £o great a Hazard. 

But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads, 
fo Reflexion upon the Folly of it, is as ordinarily the 
Exercife of more Years, or of the dear-be light Expe- 
rience of Time ; and fo it was with me now ; and yet 
fo deep had the Miftake taken Root in my Temper, 
that! could not fatisfy my felf in my Station, but was 
continually poring upon the Means and PoflibiUty of 
my Efcape from this Place ; and that 1 may with the 
greater Pleafure to the Reader bring on the remaining. 
Part of my Story, it may not be improper to give Tome 
Account of my fir ft Conceptions on the Subje& of this 
fooliih Scheme for my Efcape 5 and how, and upon what 
Foundation I a&ed. 

I am now to be fuppos'd retir'd into my Caftle, 
after my late Voyage to the Wreck, my Frigate laid 
tip, and fecur'd under Water as ufua], and my Conditi- 
on reftor'd to what it was before : I had more Wealth, 
indeed, than I had before, but was not at all the richer, 
for I had no more Ufe for it, than the Indians of Peru 
had before the Spaniards came there. 

It was* one of the Nights, in the rainy Seafon in 
March, the four and twentieth Year of my iirft fetting. 
Foot in this I (land of Solitarinefs, I was lying in my 
Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in Health, had 

no 



.( i88) 

ho Pain, noDiftemper, no Uneaflnefs of Body, no, nor a- 
nyUneafinefs of Mind,more than ordinary; but could by 
no means dole my Eyes ; that is, fo as to deep ' y no, 
not a Wink all Night long, otherwife than as follows) 

It-is as impoflibie as needleis, to let down the innu- 
merable Cro»vd of Thoughts that whirPd through that 
great Thorowfair of the Brain, the Memory, in this 
Night's Time : I run over the whole Hiftory of my 
Lite in Miniature, or by Abridgment, as I may call it, 
to my coming to this Ifland ; and alio of that Part of 
my Life fince I came to this Ifland ) in my Reflexions 
upon the State of my Cafe, fince I came on Shore on 
this Ifland, I was comparing the happy Pofture of my 
Affairs, in the firft Years of my Habitation here, com- 
par'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear, and Care, which I 
had liv'd in ever fince I bad feen the Print of a Foot 
in the Sand ; not that I did not believe the Savages 
had frequented the Ifland even all the while, and might 
have beenfeveral Hundreds of them at Times on Shore 
there; but as I had never known it, and was incapable 
of any Apprehenfions about it ; my Satisfaction was per* 
fe&, tho' my Danger was the fame ; and i was as happ/ 
in not knowing my Danger, as if I had never really been 
ejcpos'd to it ; this furnifh'd my Thoughts with many 
very profitable Reflections, and particularly this one, 
how infinitely good that Providence is, which has pro- 
vided in its Government of Mankind fiich narrow 
Bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things ; and tho' 
he walks in the midfl of fo many thoufand Dangers, 
the Sight of which, if difcover'd to him, would di- 
flra& his Mind, and fink his Spirits, he is kept ferene 
and calm, by having the Events of Things hid from 
his Eyes, and knowing nothing o( the Dangers, which 
furround him. 

After thefe Thoughts had for fome Time entertained 
me, I came to refle& ferioufly upon the real Danger I 
had been in for fo many Years in this very Ifland j and 
how I had walk'd about in the greateft Security, and 
with all poflible Tranquillity, even when perhaps no- 
thing but a Brow of a Hill, a great Tree, or the cafual 
Approach of Night, had been between me and the word 
kind of Deftru&ion, v/f. That of falling into the Hands 

of 



( i8p) 

of Canifyals and Savages, who would have feiz'd on tti$ 
with the fame View, as I did of a Goat or a Turtle, 
and have thought it no more a Crime to kill and de- 
vour me, than I did of a Pidgeori or a Curlieu ; I 
fhould unjuitly Harder my felt, W I fhould fay I was 
not flncerely thankful to my great Preferver, to whofe 
fingular Prote&ion I acknowledged, with great Humi- 
lity, that all thefe unknown Deliverances were due ; 
and without which I ihould inevitably have fallen into 
their mercilels Hands. 

When thefe Thoughts were over, my Head was for 
fonie time taken up in confidering the Nature of thefe 
wretched Creatures, I mean, the Savages ; and how it 
came to pafs in the World, that the wife Governour of 
all Things fhould give up any of his Creatures to fuch 
Inhumanity, nay, to fomething fo much below even 
Brutality it felfj as to devour its own Kind: But as 
this ended in foment that Time fruitleis) Specula* 
lions, it occur'd to me to enquire, what Part of the 
World thefe W T retches liv'd in*, how far off the Ooafl 
was from whence they came ; what they ventur'd over 
fo far from Home for ; what kind of Boats they had ; 
and why I might not order my felf, and my Bufinefs 
fo, that I might be as able to go over thither, as they 
were to come to me. 

I never fo much as troubled my felf to conflder what 
I Ihould do with my felt when I came thither ; what 
ihould become of me, if I fell into the Hauds of the 
Savages; or howl fhould efcape from them, if they 
attempted me ; no, nor fo much, as how it was pbfli- 
ble for me to reach the Coaft, and not be attempted by 
fome or other of them, without any Pofltbility of 
delivering my felf; and if I fhould not fall into their 
Hands, what I fhould do for Provifion, or whither 
I fhould bend my Courfe; none of thefe Thoughts, 
I fay 9 'fo much as came in my Way; but my Mind 
was wholly bent upon the Notion of my pafllng 
over in my Boat to the main Land : I look'd back 
upon my prefent Condition, as the moft miferable that 
could poflibly be ; that I was not able to throw myfelf 
into any thing but Death that could be call'd worfe ; 

that 



( ipo ) 

that if I reach'd the Shore of the Main, I mighfj 
perhaps, meet with Relief or I' might coaft along, as 
I did on the Shore of Ajtkk> 'till I came to fome inha- 
bited Country, and where I might find .fome Relief; 
and after all, perhaps I might fall in with fomeChri- 
ilian Ship that might take me in ; and if the word 
came to the worft, I could but die, which would put 
an End to all thtfe Miferiesat once : Pray Note, All 
this was the Fruit of a diflurb'd Mind, an impatient 
Temper, made as it were deiperate by the long Conti- 
nuance of my Troubles, and the Difappointments I had 
met in the Wreck I had been on board of, and where 
I had been fo near the obtaining what I fo earndtly 
long'd for, vt\. fome Body to fpeak to y and to learn 
fome Knowledg from, of the Place where I was, and 
of the probable Means of my Deliverance; I fay, I 
was agitated wholly by thefe Thoughts: All my Calm 
of Mind in my Refignation to Providence, and wait- 
ing the IfTue of the Difpofitions of Heaven, feem'dto 
be fufpended, and I had, as it were, no Power to 
turn my Thoughts to any Thing, but the Proje& of a 
Voyage to the Main, which came upon me with fucli 
Force, and fuch an Impetuofity of Deiire, that it was 
not to be refilled. 

When this had agitated my Thoughts for two Hours, 
<?r more, with fuch Violence, that it fet my very Blood 
into a Ferment, and my Pulfe beat as high as if J had 
been in a Fever, merely with the extraordinary Fer- 
vour of my Mind about it f Nature, as if I had been 
fatigu'd and exhaufted with the very Thought of it, 
threw me into a found Sleep: One would have thought 
I ihould have dreamt of it ; but I did not, nor of any 
thing relating to it ; but I dreamt, that as I was going 
Out in the Morning, z.s ufual, from my Caftle, I few 
upon the Shore two Canoes^ and eleven Savages coming 
to Land, and that they brought with them another Sa- 
vage, who they were going to kill, in order to eat him ; 
i^hen, on a fudden, the Savage, that they were going 
to kill, jump'd away, and ran for his Life; then I 
thought in my Sleep, that he came running into my 
little thick Grove, before my Fortification, to hide 
Mmielf and -that X feeing him alone, and Dot perceiv- 
ing 



.fag that. the other fought him that way, fliewM my felf 
to him, and fmiling upon him, encourag'd him : That; 
he kneePd down to me, Teeming to pray me to aflift 
him; upon which I fhew'd my Ladder, made him go 
•up, and carried him into my Cave, and he became 
my Servant * y and that as foon as I had gotten this Man, 
I laid to my felf, Now I may certainly venture to the 
Main Land; for this Fellow will ferve me as a Pilot, 
and will tell me what to do, and whither to go for 
ProvijGons ; and whether not to go for fear of being 
devoured, what Places to venture into, and what to 
efcape. I wak'd with this Thought, and was under 
fuch inexpreffible Impreffions of Joy at the Profpe& of 
my Elcape in my Dream, that the Difappointments 
which I felt upon coming to my felf, and finding it 
was no more than a Dream, were etjually extravagant 
the other way, and threw me into a very great Dejec- 
tion of Spirit. 

Upon this, however, I made this Conclufion, That 
my only way to go about an Attempt for an Efcape, 
was, if poflible, to get a Savage into my PofTelTion ; 
and, if pofTible, it ihould be one of their Prifoners,, 
whom they had condemn' d to be eaten, and ihould 
bring thither to kill ; but thefe Thoughts ftill were 
attended with this Difficulty, that it was impofTible 
.to eifed this, without attacking a whole Caravan of 
them, and killing them all ; and this was not only a 
very defperate Attempt, and might mifcarry ; but, on 
the other hand, I had jgreatly fcrupl'd the Lawt'ulneis of 
it to me, and my Heart trembled at the Thoughts of 
ihedding fo much Blood, tho s it was for my Delive- 
rance i I .need not repeat the Arguments which oceur'd 
to me againft this, they being the fame mention'd be- 
fore : But tho* I had other Reafons to offer now 3 vt^ m 
That thofe Men were Enemies to my Life, and would 
devour me, if they could, that it was Self-prefervati- 
^on in the higheft Degree, to deliver my felf from this 
Death of a Life, and wasa&ing in my own Defence, as 
much as if they were a&ually afTaulting me, and the 
like; I fay, tho' thefe things argued for it, yet the 
Thoughts of fhedding human Blood for my Delive- 
rance, were very terrible to me, and fuch as! could by 
*io Means reconcile my felf to a great while. How- 



C ip* ) 

' However, at laft, after many fecret Difputes witfi 
tnyfelf, ana after great Perplexities about it, (for all 
thefe Arguments, one way and another, ftruggled in 
my Head a long time) the eager prevailing Delire 
of Deliverance at length mafter'd all the reft, and I re- 
folv'd, if poilible, to get one of thefe Savages into my 
Hands, coft what it would : My next thing then was 
to contrive how to do it ; and this indeed was very 
difficult to refolve on 5 But as I could pitch upon no 
probable Means for it, fo I refolv'd to put my fell' upon 
the Watch, to fee them when they came on Shore, and 
leave the reft to the Event, taking fuch Meafures as the 
Opportunity mould prefent, let be what would be. 

With theie Refolutions in my Thoughts, I fet myfelf 
upon the Scout, as often as poilible, and indeed fo often 
till I was heartily tired of it ; for it was above a Year 
and a half that I waited, and for great part of that Time 
went out fo the Weft-End, and to the South-Weft Cor- 
ner of the Ifland almoft every Day, to fee for Canoes, 
"but none appear'd : This was very difcouraging, and 
began to trouble me much ; tho' I can't fay that it did 
in this Cafe as it had done fometime before that, vi%, 
wear off the Edge of my Defire to the thing, . but the 
longer it feem'd to be delay 'd, the more eager I was for 
it : In a Word, I was not at firft more careful to fhun the 
Sight of thefe Savages, and avoid being feen by them, 
than I was now eager to be upon them. , 

Befides, I fancied myfelf able to manage one, nay, 
two or three Savages, if I had them, Co as to make them 
entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever I ihould dire& 
them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do 
me any Hurt : It was a great while that I pleased jooy- 
ielf with this Affair ; but nothing ftill prefented ; all 
my Fancies and Schemes came to nothing, for no Sava- 
ges came near me for a great while. , 

About a Year and half after I had entertain'd thefe 
Notions, and, by long muling, had as it were refolv'd 
them all into nothing, for want of an Occaiion to put 
them in Execution, 1 was furpriz'd one Morning early, 
with feeing no lefs than five Canoes all on Shore toge- 
ther on my Side the Ifland, and the People who be- 
long'd to them all landed, and out of my Sight ; The 

Num- 



( ^3 V 

Number of them broke all my Meafures \ for feeing To 
many, and knowing that they always came four, or iix, 
or Tome times --more, in a Bqat, I could not tell what to 
think of it, or how to take my Meafures, to attack 
twenty or thirty Men flngle-handed ; lb I lay (till in 
my Cattle, perplex'd and difcomforted ; however I put 
my felf into all the fame Poftures for an Attack, that 
I had formerly provided, and was juft ready for A&ion, 
if any thing had prefented : Having waited a gdod. 
while, listening to hear if they made any Noile, at length 
being very impatient, I fet my Guns at the Foot of my 
Ladder, and clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill by 
my two Stages, as ufual •, {landing lb however, that 
my Head did not appear above the Hill ; fo that they 
could not perceive me by any Means : Here I abferv'd, 
by the help of my Perfpe&ive-Glafs, that they were 
no lefs than thirty in Number, that they had a Fire had 
kindled, and that they had had Meat drefs'd ; how they 
cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was, but they 
were all dancing, in I know not how many barbarous 
Gedures a-nd Figures, their own Way, round the Fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceiv'd by my 
Perfpe&ive two miferaUe Wretches drag'd from the 
Boats, where, it feems, they were laid by, und were 
now brought out for the Slaughter ,• I perceived one of 
them immediately fell, bdngknock'd down, I fuppofe 
with a Club or wooden Sword, for that was their Way, 
and two or three others wer£ at work immediately, cut- 
ting him open for their Cookery, while the other Vi- 
ctim was left ftanding by hintfeUj till they ihould be 
ready for him : Tn that veryMoment this poor Wretch fee- 
ing him felf a little at Liberty, Nature infpir'd him with 
Hopes of Life, and he darted away from them, and 
ran with incredible Swiftneis along the Sands dire&ly 
towards me, I mean, towards that Part o[ the C©a(t 
where my Habitation was. 

I was dreadfully frighted (that I mud acknowledge) 
when I perceiv'd him to run my Way ; and efpecially* 
ivhbn, as I thought, I faw him purfued by the whole 
Body ; and now 1 expe&ed that Part of my Dream was 
coming to pafs, and that he would certainly take ilielter 
in my Grove j but I could not depend by any means 
K . upon 



( IP4 ) ■ 



tfpon my Dream for the reft: of it, vl^. that the other 
Savages would not pur Cue him thither, and find him 
there ; However, 1 kept my Station, and my Spirits be-» 
gan to recover, when 1 found that there was not above 
three Men that follow'd him ; and ftill more was I en- 
couraged, when I found that he outftript them exceed- 
ing!:)' in running, and gain'd Ground of them, fo that if 
he could but hold it for half an Hour, I law eaiily he 
would fairly get away from them all. 

There was between them and my Caftle the Creek 
which I mentioned often at the firft Part of my Story, 
when I landed my Cargoes out of the Ship \ and this I 
knew, he mufl: neceflarily fwim over, or the poor 
Wretch would be taken there \ But when the Savage ef- 
caping came thither, he made .nothing oi" it, tho' the 
Tide was then up ; but plunging in, {'warn thro' in a- 
bout thirty Strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on 
with exceeding Strength and Swif tnefs ; when the three 
Farmers came to the Creek, I found that two of them 
could fwim, but the third could not, and that he (landing 
on the other Side, looked at the other, but went no 
further •, and fbon after went foftly back again, which, 
as it happen' d, was very well for him in the Main. 

I oblerv'd, that the two who fvvam, were yet more 
than twice as long fwimming over the Creek, than the 
-fellow was that Hed from them : It came nolv very 
warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed irrefiftibly, 
that now was my Time to get me a Servant, and per- 
haps a Companion, or Affiftant, and that I was call'd 
plainly by Providence to fave this poor Creature's 
"Life ; I immediately gat down the Ladders with all pop 
fible Expedition* fetch'd my two Guns, for they were 
both at the Foot of the Ladders, as I obferv'd above i; 
and getting up again with the fame hafte, to the Top 
of the Hill, I crols'd toward the Sea ; and having a ve- 
ry fhort cut, and all down Hill, clap'd my felf in the 
Way between the Purfuers and the purfued, hallowing 
aloud to him that fled, who looking back, was at iirit 
perhaps as irtuch frighted at me, as at them ; but I bee 
kon'd with my Hand to* him to come back, and in the 
mean time, I flowly advanced towards the two that fol- 
.iow'd 5 then rufliing at once upon the foremoft, I knoek'd 

him 



(' T 47.) 

StodWn with the Stock -oi my Piece; I was loth t&

Riilance it would not have been eafily heard > arid be- 
ing out of" Mght; of the Smoak too, they would not have 
ealily known what to .make of it ; Having knocked this 
Fellow down, the other who purfu'd him ttopt, as if he 
had been frighted, and I advanced a pace towards him ; 
but as I came nearer, , I perceived presently, he .had a Bow 
and Arrow, andwas fitting it to fhoot at me; lb, I was 
then rieeeflitated to ftoot at him firft ; which I did, and 
kill'd him at the fcrft Shot; The poor Savage who iled* 
but had llop'd, tho 5 he law both his. Enemies fallen, 
and kill'd, (as he thought, ) yet was fo frighted with the 
Fire, and None of my Piece, that he Hood flock flill, 
and neither came forward or went, backward, tho* he 
feem'd rather inclined to fly {till, than to come on ; I 
hollqwd again to him, .and. made Signs* to come for? 
ward,, which he eafily underftood, and came a little way* 
then ftop'd again, and then : a little farther, andsftop-d a* 
gain j and I could then perceive that he flood tremblings 
as i fie had been, taken Prifoner, and had ju£fc been to be 
kill'd, as his two Enemies were ; I beckon'd him again 
to come to me, and gave him all the Signs of Encou- 
ragement that! could think of ; and he came nearer and 
nearer, kneeling down every t?n or twelve Steps,, in to- 
ken ol Acknowledgment for faying his Life ; I fniil'd 
3t him, .arid look'd pleafantly, and beckon'd to him to 
come fttll nearer •, at length he came dole to me, and 
then he kneel'd down again, kifs'd the Ground, , and. laid 
his Head upon the Ground, and taking me by the Foot, 
fetm> Foot upon his Head ; This, it feerrts, was in to<- 
ken of fwearing to be my Slave for ever : \ took him 
*ip,,and made much of him, and encouraged him all I 
CtiuUL:,-But there was more Work to do yet, for I perr 
^eiv'd the Savage whom I knock'd down, was not kill'd^ 
tout ftun'd with the Blow, and began to come to himfelf; 
Xo I pointed to him, and fb owing him the. Savage, that 
he was not dead^ upon this he fpoke.fome Words to 
me, and tho v I could not underfland them* yet I thought 
they were pleafant to hear, for <hey were the firft Sound

fitch Refle&ions How ; the Savage, who was knock**! 
down, recover'd hiinfelf fo far, as to fit up upon the 
Ground, and I perceived that my Savage began to be 
afraid 5 but when I law that, Iprefented my other Piece 
at the Man, as if I would ihoot hint •, upon this my Sa- 
vage, fi r fo I call him ncr» y made a Motion to me to 
lend him my Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by 
my Side ; fo I did : He no fooner had it, but he runs to 
his Enemy, and at one Blow cut off his Head as cleverly, 
no Executioner in Germany could have done it fooner 
or better ; which I thought very ftrange, for one, who 
I had reafon to believe, never faw a Sword in his Life 
before, except their own wooden Swords ; however, it 
feems, as I leanfd afterwards, they make their wooden 
Swords fo fharp, fo heavy, and the Wood is fo hard, 
that they will cutoff Heads even with them, ay and 
Arms, and that at one Blow too: When he had done 
this, he? comes laughing to me in Sign of Triumph, and 
brought me the Sword again, and with abundance of 
fGeftures, which I did not underftand, laid It down 
with the Head of the Savage that he had kill'd, juft be- 
fore me. 

But that which aftonifii'd him raoft was, to know how 
I had kiird the other Indian fo far off; fo y pointing to 
him, he made Signs to me to let him go to him ; So I 
bad him go, as well as I could ; when he came to him, 
he flood like one amai'd, looking at him,turn*d him iirft 
on one fide ; then on t'other, look'd at the Wound the 
Bullet had made, which it feems was juft in his Breaft, 
where it had made a Hole, and no great Quantity of 
Blood had follow'd r but he had bled inwardly, for he was 
quite dead : Then he took up his Bow and Arrows , and 
cr,me back ; fo I turn'd to go away, and beckon'd to 
him to follow me, making Signs to him that more might 
come after them. 

Upon this he fign'd to me, that he fhould bury them 
with Sand, that they might not be feen by the reft iF 
they followed ; and fb I made Signs again to him to do 
fo ; he fell to work, and in an Inftant he had fcrap'd a 
Hole in the Sand with his Hands, big enough to bury 
the firft in, and then drag'd him into it, and covered 
i)im, and did fo alio by the other j I believe he had 
' ' bury'd 



" ('. *97 ) • 

bury\l them both in a Quarter of an Hour; then car 
ling him away, I carry'd him not to my Caftle, hut 
quite away to my Cave, on the further Part of the i- 
fland > f© I did not let my Dream come to pais in th^t 
Part, vi^. That he came into my Grove for Shelter* 

Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raifins to 
fat, and a Draught of Water, which I found he was in- 
deed in great Diilrefs for, -by his running; and Laving 
rerreftfd him, I made Signs-tor him to go lie down and 
fleep, pointing to a Place where I had laid a great Par* 
eel of Rice Straw > and a Blanket upon it, which I uled 
to ileep upon -my (elf fo me times \ fo the poor Creature 
laid down and went to ileep. 

He was a comely handfome Fellow, perfe&ly well 
made, with ftrait long Limbs, not too large, tail, and 
well ihap'd ; and, as I reckon, about twenty -fix Years 
©i Age. He had a very goiod Countenance, not a fierce 
and furly Afpc&, but i'eem'd to have fomething very 
manly in his Face, and ytt he had all the Sweetnefsand 
Softneis of an Eurcpean in iiis Countenance too, efpe* 
cialjy when he fmiPd : His Hair was long and black, 
not curi'd like Wool j his Forehead very high, and large, 
and a great Vivacity and fparkling Sharpnefs in his Byes. 
The Colour of his Skin was not quite black, but very 
tawny, and yet not of an ugly yellow naufeous Tawny, 
as the Brafilians, and Virginians^ and other Natives of 
.America are, but of a bright kind of a dun Olive Co- 
lour, that had in it fomething very agreeable, tho' not 
very eafy to defcribe. His Face was round and plump, 
his Noie fmall, not flat like the Negroes, a. very good 
Mouth, thin Lips, and his Teeth fine* well iet 5 and 
white as Ivory : After he' had (lumber 7 d* rather than 
flept, about half an Hour, he wak'd again, and comes 
out of the Cave to me, for I had been milking my Goats, 
which I had in the Enclofure juil by; When he efpy'd 
me, he came running to me, laying himfelf down again 
upon the Ground, with all the poifible Signs of an hum- 
ble thankful Difpofition, making a many antick Geftures 
to (how it: At lall he lays his-Head flat upon theGround, 
clofe to my Foot, and lets my other Foot upon his Head* 
as he had done before j and after this, made ail th« 



(198) 

Signs to me of Subje&ion, Servitude, and Submiflloi* 
imaginable, to let me know how he would ferve me as 
long as he- Hv'd : I underitood him in many things, and 
let uim know I was very well pleas' d with him j in a 
little time I began to fpeak to him, and teach him to 
ipeak to me ; and firft, I made him know his Name 
Ihould bef Friday, which was the Day I fav'd his Life ; 
and I calFd him io for the Memory or the time - y 1 like* 
w iie- taught him to lay Mafter, and then let him know 
that was to be my Name \ I like wile taught him to fay 
Tts and iSfr, and to know the Meaning ot' them*, I gave 
him lb roe Milk in an earthen Pot, ana let him fee me 
drink it before him, and fop my Bread in it ; and £ 
gave him a Cake of Bread to do the like, which he 
quickly -domply'd with, and made Signs that it was ve. 
xy good for him. : 

1 kept there with him all that Night, but as fcoh as 
it was Day, I beckon'd to him to come with me, and 
let him know I would give him fome Cloaths, at which 
he (eem'd very glad, tor he was ilark-naked : As we 
went by the Place where he had bury'd the two Men^ 
he pointed exactly to the Spot, and fhew'd me the 
Marks that he bad made to find them again 5 making 
Signs to me that? we ihould dig them up again, and eat 
them ; at this I appear^ very angty, exprefs'd my Ab* 
horrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the Thought* 
of it, and beckon*d with my Hand to him to come a- 
way, which he did immediately^ with great Submufion : 
I then led him tip to the Top of the Hill, to fee if hi* 
Enemies were gone ) and pulling out my* Glafs, I 
look'd, and faw plainly the Place whfcrd they had been* 
bat no Appearance of them, or of their Canoes ; fo that It 
was plain that they were gone, and had left theirtwo 
-.Comrades behind them,' without any Search after them. 
But I was not content with this- Difcovery, but ha- 
ving now more Courage, and confequently more Curio* 
fity, I took my Man Friday with me, giving liim the 
Sword in his Hand* with thd Bow and Arrow* af his 
Back 5 which -I found he could Ufe very dexfrouflyj 
making hiuvcanrry one Gun for me, and P twa- tik my- 
Mi; and away wa-march'd to the Plade whete 'ttiefo 
Creatures had been \ for I had a mind now to get fome 

fuller 



{ 199 ) *■" 

fuller Intelligence of them: When I came to the Place", 
my very Blood ran ehill in my Veins, and my Heart 
funk within me at the Horror of the Spe&aele : Indeed 
it *was a dreadful Sight, at leaft it was fo to me, -tha* 
Friday mads nothing or it : The Place was covered with 
human Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood, 
great Pieces of Fle/h left here and there, half eaten, 
mangled and fcoreh'd ; and, in fhort, all the Tokens of 
the triumphant Feaft they had been making there, af- 
ter a Vi&ory over their Enemies: I faw three Skulls, 
five Hands, and the Bones of three or four Legs and 
Feet, and abundance of other Parts of the Bodies ; and 
Friday, by his Signs, made me underftand, that they 
brought over four Priioners to feail upon ; that three of 
them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himfelf, 
was the fourth : That there had been a great Battel be- 
tween them and. their next King, whole Subjeft it 
feems he had been one of ; and that they had taken a 
great Number of Prifoners, all which were carried to 
ieveral Places by thofe that had taken them in the 
Fight, in order to feaft upon them, as was done here by 
thefe Wretches upon thole they brought hither. 

I caus'd Friday to gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flefh, 
and whatever remain'd, and lay them together on a 
Heap, and make a great Fire upon it, and burn them 
all to Afhes : I found Friday had ftill a hankering Sto- 
mach after fome of the Flefh, and was ftill a Cannibal in 
lus Nature \ but I difcover'd fo much Abhorrence at 
the very Thoughts of it, and at the leaft Appearance c£ 
it, that he durft not difcover it ; for I had, by fame 
means, let him know that I would kill him if he of* 
fer'd it. 

When we had done this, we came back to our Caftle,' 
and there I fell to work for my Man Friday ; and iirft 
of all I gave him a Pair of Linen Drawers, which T hc.d 
out of the poor Gunner's Cheft I mention'd, and which 
I found in the Wreck*, and which, with a little Alte- 
ration, fitted him very well ; then I made him a* Jer- 
kin of GoatVSkin, as well as my Skill would allow , 
and I was now grown a tolerable good Taylor ; and f 
gave htm a Cap, which I had made of a Hare-Skin, 
very convenient and faflrionable enough \ and thus he 
K 4 was 



( 2 CO ) 

was drefs'd, for the prefent, tolerably wel^and mighty 
well was he pleas'd to ice himielf almoft as well cloath'd 
as his Mailer: It's true, he went aukwardly in thefe 
things at firft; wearing the Drawers was very aukward 
to .him, and the Sleeves of the Waiftcoat gall'd his 
Shoulders, and the Infide of his Arms; hut a little 
,caiing them, where he complain 5 d they hurt him, and 
uiing himielf to them, at length he took to them very 
well. 

The next Day after I came Home to my Hutch with 
him, I began to con fider where I fhould lodge him ; and 
that I might do well for him, and yet be perfe&ly eaiy 
my felt : J made a little Tent for him in the vacant 
Place between my two Fortifications, in the Infide of 
the lad, and in the Outfideofthe firft: And as there 
was a Door or Entrance there into my Cave, I made 
a formal frarrfd Door- Cafe, and a Door to it of Boards, 
and let it up in the Paflage, a little within the Entrance; 
and caufing the Door to open on the Infide, 1 barr'd it 
up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too; fo that 
Triday could no way come at me in the Infide of my 
innermoft Wall, without making fo much Noife in get- 
ting over, that it muil needs awaken me ; for my firft 
Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long Poles, 
covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the Side of 
the Hill, which was again laid crois with fmall Sticks 
inftead of Laths, and then thatch'd over a great Thick- 
nefs with the Rice»Straw, which was ftrong like Reeds; 
and at the Hole or Place which was left to go in or out 
Iby the Ladder, I had plac'd a kind of Trap-Door, which 
if it had been attempted on the Out-fide, would not 
have open'd at all, but would have fallen down, and 
made a great Noife ; and as to Weapons, I took them 
all into my Side every Night, 

But I needed none of all this Precaution ; for never 
Man had a more faith fid, loving, fincere Servant than 
Friday was to me; without PafTions, Sullenefs, or De- 
ilgns ; perfe&ly oblig'd and engag'd ; his very AfTe£ions 
were ty'd to me, like thofe of a Child to a Father ; and 
I dare lay, he would have facrihVd his Life for the fav- 
ing mine, upon any Occa/ion whatfoever : The -many 
Teftimonies he gave me of this, put it outx>f doubc, 

and 



( 2QI } . 

and foon convinced me, that I needed to ufe no Precau* 
tions as to my Safety on his account. 

This frequently gave me occafion to obferve, and that 
with wonder, that however it had pleas'd God in his 
Providence, and in the Government of the Works of 
his Hands, to take from fo great a Part of the World of 
his Creatures, the beft Ufes to which their Faculties, 
and the Powers of their Souls are adapted ; yet that he 
has beftow'd upon them the fame Powers, the fame 
Reafon, the fame AiFe&ions, the fame Sentiments of 
Xindnefs and Obligation, the fame Pallions and Refent- 
ments of Wrongs, the fame Sen fe of Gratitude, Since- 
rity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good t 
and receiving Good, that he has given to us ; and that 
when he pieafes to oflrer them Occifrons of exerting 
thefe, they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them 
to the right Ufes for which they were beftow'd, than 
we are ; And tmVmade me very melancholy ibmetmtes, 
in reile&ing, as the feveral Occaflons prelented, ; bow 
mean a Ufe we make of all thefe, even though' we -have 
thefe Powers enlightened by the great Lamp of Infrac- 
tion, the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge 1 of his 
Word, added to our Understanding v ^nd why it has 
pleafed God to hide the like faving Knowledge from for 
many Millions of Souls, who (if 1 might judge by this 
porir Savage) would make a much better U(q of it thatu 
we did. -.' :[l J : '

conMy p That ftill as we are all the Clay in the Hand of 
the Potter, no Veffel could (ay to him, Why haft thou 
ibrm'd me thus,? : 

But to return to my new Companion: I was greatly 
delighted with him, and made it my Bufinefs to teach 
him every thing that was proper to make him ufehil, 
handy and helpiul ; but efpecially to make him, fpeak* 
and underftand me when I fpake; and he was the apteil: 
Scholar that ever was, and particularly was fo merry;, 
fo conftantly diligent, and fa pleas'd when he could bui 
underftand me, or make me underftand him, that' it 
was very pleafant to trie to,, talk to him \ and now my 
Life began to be.,fo eafy, that I began to fay to, my fell?, 
that could I but have been fafe from more Savages, I 
cared not if I was never to remove from the Place while 
Iliv'd. .... 

After I had been two or three, bays return'd to my 
Caftle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday off from 
his horrid way of feeding, and from the Rejifhi of a 
Cannibals Stomachy I ought to Jet him tafte other J?kfii; 
Jo .1 took him .out with me one Morning to the Woods: 
I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of -my own 
Flock, and bring it home and idrefs it: But.asi was 
going, I law;a StysrGoat lyingidown in the Shade, and 
two young jiids fitting by her : % catch'd hold, of Fri- 
day, hold, iaysJj^nd^ilL-, an4 mad©/ Signs to hvm

and kiir<d one of } the iiids. ^ %e r pdprj Creature, who 
tad at a Diftance s indeed, fe$i me kill the, Savage, Iris 
Ensmy, but cJifl ',#<% ; few, <& ceuld imagine how it 
was done, was ienfib^ iUrptiz-'d, trembled and fhooJ^ 
and look'd fo amax'd, that I thought he would have 
Funk down 1 He did not fee the Kiid : I had ftot at, or 
perceive I had kill'd it, but rip'd up . his ' Waifldoat to 
feel if he was not wounded, \ ^«d as I found, profentljr 
thought I was rejblv'd to kill him*,; for he/ came: and 
kneerd dowrito *me» and embra^g, niy Knees, iaid a

caflly fee that the Meaning was to p**y rtie not to kill

at him, and pointing to . the Kid which I had kitt'd* 
beckon'd to him, to run and fetch it, which he did ; 
and while he was wondering and looking to fee how 
the Creature was kill'd, I loaded my Gun again, and 
by-and-by I law a great Fowl, like a Hawk, fit upon' 
a Tree within lhot ; fo, to let Friday underiland a little 
what I would do, I call'd him to me again, pointing at 
the Fowl, which was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it 
had been a Hawk \ I fay, pointing to .the Parrot, and 
to my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let 
him fee I would make it fall, I made him underftand 
that I would Ihoot and kill that Bird ; accordingly I 
fir'd, and bad him look, and immediately he faw the 
Parrot fall : He ftood like one frighted again, notwith- 
(landing all I had laid to him \ and I found he was the 
, more amaz'd, becauie he did not * fee me put any thing, 
into the Guji \ but thought that there mull be fome 
. wonderful Fund of Death' and Deftni&ion in that 
Thing, able to kill Man, Beaft, Bird, or any thing near 
or far off \ for the Ailonifhment this created in him^ 
was fuch, as could not wear off for a long time 5 and I 
believe, if I would have let him, he wculd have wor- - 
fhip'd me and my Gun ; As for the Gun it fel£ be 
would not fo much as touch it for feveral Days after ; 
but would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had anr 
fwer'd him, when he was by himlelf; ■> which as I a£« 
terwardU learned oi him, was to deiire it not to kill hdmv 
Well ; After his Aftonifliment was a little over at 
this, I pointed to him to mn and fetch the Bird I had 
ihot, which he did, but flay'd fome Time; for the Par- 
rot not being quite dead, was flutter^ a good way dF 
from the Place where fhefel); however, he found her, 
took her up, and brought her .f.o me \\ and, as I had 
perceiv'd his Ignorance about- the Gwi before, I took 
this Advantage to charge the Gun again, and, not let 
faim fee me do it, that I aiigbt be ready for any other 
Mark that might prelent 5 but nothing more offer' d~ at 
that Time; fo I brought home the JUd ; and the fame* 
Evening 1 took the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I 
could, and having a Pot for that Purpofe, I boil'd or 
-ftew'd fome of the Fleih, and made fome very go©&

to my Man, who feeru'd very glad of it, and fik'd" it 
very well ; but that which was ftrangeft to him, was 
to lee me ?at Salt with it : He made a Sign to me, that 
the Salt was net good to eat, and putting a little into 
his own Mouth, he feemM to nauleate it, and would 
ipitand fputter at it, wafhing his Mouth with frefh. 
Water after it ; on the other hand, I took Tome Meat 
in my Mouth without Salt, and I pretended to fpit and 
i putter for want of Salt, as' fail as he had done at f he- 
Sal r ; but it would not do, he would never care for 
Salt with Meat, or in his Broth ; at leaft, not a great 
while, and then but a very little. 

Having thus fed him with boiFd Meat and Broth, I 
was refolv'd to feaft him the next Day with roaftin& a 
Piece of the Kid ; this I did by hanging it before the 
Fire in a String, its f had feen many People do in Eng- 
land) fetting two Poles up, one on each fide the Fire, 
and one crois on the top, and tying the String to the 
crofs Stick, letting the Meat turn continually : This 
Friday adrmVd very much ; but when he came to tafle 
the Fleih, he took fo many ways to tell me how well he 
lik'd it, that I could not but underiland him; and at 
laft he told me he would never eat Man's Flefh any 
more, which I was very glad to hear. 

The next Day I fee him to work to beating, fome Corn 
©ut, and lifting it in the manner I ufed to do, as I ob- 
ferv'd before ; and he foon underftoad how to do it as, 
well as I, efpecially, after he had feen what the Mean- 
ing of it was, and that it was to make Bread of; for 
after that I let him fee me make my Bread, and bake it 
too; and in a little Time Friday was able to do ail the 
Work for me, as well as I could do it my felf. 

I began How to confider, that having two Mouths to 
feed initead of one, I muft provide more Ground for 
my Harveft, and plant a larger Quantity of Corn than 
I Ufed to do ; fo 1 mark'd out a larger Piece of Land, 
and began the Fence in the fame manner as before, in 
which Friday not only worked very willingly and very 
hard, but did it very chearfully ; and I, told him what 
it was for, that it was for Corn to make more Bread, 
becaufe he was now with me, and that I might have 
coough. for him aiid my felf too ; He appear'd very fen- 

fible 



( 205 ) 

fible of that Part, and let me know, that he thought f 
had much more Labour upon me on his Account, than 
I had tor my felf ; and that he would work the harder 
for me, if 1 would tell him what to do. 

This was the pleafanteft Year of all the Life I led ia 
this Place : Friday began to talk pretty well, and un- 
derftand the Names of almoft every Thing I had Occa- 
iion to call for, and o? every Place I had to fend him to, 
and talk a great deal to me; io that, in fhort, 1 began 
now to have fome ufe for my Tongue again, which in- 
deed I had very little Occafion for before ; that is to 
fay, about Speech : Befides the Pleafure of talking to 
him, I had a lingular Satisfaction in the Fellow himfelf ; 
his fimple unfeign'd Honefty appear'd to me more and 
more every Day, and I began really to love the Crea- 
ture ; and on his Side, I believe he lor'd me more 
than it was poffible for him ever to love any thing be- 
fore. 

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering In- 
clination to his own Country again ; and having lea rn'd 
him Fnglijh fo well, that he could anfwer me almoft a- 
ny Queftions, I ask'd him whether the Nation that he 
belong'd to never conquer' d in Battle ? At which he 
fmiPd and faid, Yes, yes, we always fight the better ; 
that is, he meant always get the better in Fight, and fo vtb 
began the following Difcourfe. You always fight die bet- 
ter, faid I, How came you to be taken Prifoner then 
Friday ? 

Friday* My Nation beat much, for all that, 

Mafter. How beat ; if your Nation beat them, how 
came you to be taken ? 

Friday. They more than my Nation in the Place 
where me was *, they take one, two, three, and me : My 
Nation over-beat them in the yonder Place, where me 
no was j there myNation take one, two, great Th jufancL 

Mafler. But why did not your Side recover ybii fr$m 
the Hands of your Enemies then ? .' 

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and mak6 
go in the Canoe \ my Nation have no Canoe that Time. 

Mafler. Wei!, Friday, and what does your Nation' dd 
with the Men they take ? Do they carry them awajir, 
and^eat themy as thefedid ? • : ' l vmI ^ 



( 205 ) 

Jrtday, Yes, my Nation eat Man's too, eat all up* 

Mafler. Where do they carry them ? 

Friday. Go to other Place where they think. 

Mafter. Do they come hither ? 

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither ; come other elfe 
Place, 

Majier. Haye you been here with them ? 

Friday. Yes, I been here : ^Points h tbs N. W. Side 
of the lflandy -wtikh> it feem$ y was their Side.j 

By this I underftood, that my Man Friday had former- 
ly been among the Savages, who uled to cornc on Shore 
on the farther Part of, the Ifland, on. the laid Man-eat- 
ing Occafions that he was now brought for \ and Come 
time after, when I took the Courage to carry him to 
that Side, being the fame I formerly mention' d> he pre- 
fently knew the Place, and told me, he was there once 
when they eat up Twenty Men, two Women, and one 
Child; He could not tell twenty in Erig lijh, but he 
luitnber'd them hy laying (o many Stones in a Row, and 
pointing tome to tell them over. 

I have told this Paf&ge, becaufe it introduces what 
follows ; that after j had had this Difcourfe with him,. 
I ask'd him how far it was from our Ifland to the Shore, 
and whether tl;e Canoes were not often loft ; He told me 
there was no Danger, no Canoes ever loft ; but that af- 
ter a little way out Xo Sea, there was a Current, and a 
Wind always pne \>Vay in die Morning, the other in 
the Afternoon. 

This I underftood to be no more than, the Sets of the 
*£Me>. as going out, or coming in. '■> hut I afterwards un- 
clerftood it was occaiionM by the great Draft and Re- 
flux of the mighty River Oroonaque \ in the Mouth, of 
which .River, as $ thought afterwards, our Ifland lay; 
knd that this Land\ whidli I perceived, to jthe'W. and 
K.^y. was the great JtiJand, Trimdad r on, the North 
ybmj of the Mouth of^ River: I as^'a Friday a thou- 
land Queftions about t^Coiftntry, the Inhabitants,, the 
Sea, the Coaft, and wnat Nations were near ; he told 
pie all he knew, wi|h ths greateft Opennefe imaginable : 
Xask'd him the Names .of the, fev«ral Nations of his 
for,t ofPeople, feut coujd g$t co other Name than Carihs \

CartlkeSi which our Maps place on that Part of Ami* 
ma, which readies from the Mouth of the River Oroo- 
ncque to Guiam> arid onwards to St. Martha j He told 
me that up a great way beyond the Mpon, that was, 
beyond the letting of the Moon, which mud be W» 
from their Country, there dwelt white- bearded Menv 
like me ; and pointed to my great Whiskers, which I 
mention'd beibre ; and that they had kill'd much Mans* 
that was his Word : By all which I underftood he 
meant ^he Spaniards, whofe Cruelties^ iri America had 
been fpread over the whole Countries, and were re- 
membered by all the Nations from Father to Son. 

I enquired if he could tell me how I might come from 
this Ifland, and get among thofe white Men;, he told 
me, Yes, yes, I might go in two Cawe ; I could not 
underftand what he meant by two Canoe, till at laft, with 

freat Difficulty, I found he mea?n$* : tllat it muft be in a 
arge great Boat, as big as two Canoes* > 

t'rhis; Part o^ Friday Difcourfe, began to relifb witk 
me very well*, and from this time I entertain -d fame 
Hopes, that one time or oj/he# I- might find an Oppor- 
tunity to make my Bfcape from this Place, and that 
this poor Savage might, be, a means- to help me to 
doit. * ' ■ -., .-. ■• 

During the longtime that Fr.i*% had mw: been with 
me, and, that be began to {peak to -'iifce, &fi& underftatid

MemmucUe : Then I askM him, whether thefe they 
cat up went thither too ? Hefaid, Yes. 

From theie Things I began to inuVucY him in the 
Knowledge of the true God. I told him, that the great 
Maker oi all Things lived up there, pointing up to- 
wards Heayen : That he governs the World by the 
fame Power and Providence by which he had made it : 
That he was Omnipotent, could do every thing for us, 
give every thing to us, take every thing from us ; and 
thus, by Degrees, I open'd his Eyes : He liften'd with 
■great Attention, and received with Pleafure the Noti- 
on of Jefus Cbrifi being lent to redeem us, and of the 
manner of making our Prayers to God, and his being 
able to hear us, even into Heaven : He told me one 
Day, that if our God could hear tis up beyond the Sun, 
he rnuft needs be a greater God than their Benanwckee, 
who liv'd but a little way off, and yet could not hear, 
till they went up to the great Mountains where he 
dwelt, to fpeak to him : I ask'd him, if ever he went 
thither to fpeak to him : He &id, No, they ne^er went 
that were young Meft ; none went thither but the old 
Men, who he call'd their Ocvookakze, that is, as I made 
him explain it- to me, their Religious, or Clergy ; and 
that they went to fay 0, (Co he caird faying Prayers) 
and then eame back, and told them what Berxtfauctee 
faid : By this I obierv'd, that" there is Pfitficrajt even 
amongd the moil blinded ignorant Pagans in the World;, 
and the Policy o£ making a fecrst Religion, in order to 
■preferve the Veneration pt the" People to the Glergv, 
is not only to bd found in the Roman y l>ut perhaps' a- 
mongall Religions in the World, even* among the moil 
brutiih and barbarous Savages. ■ ■ 

I endeavour'd to clear up thisFnaud to my Man frh 
dqi r and told biitt, that the Pretence "--of their bid- Men 
going up to the Mountains 1 to fay to their God Bend* 
muckge$ was a Cheat, and- their-fopinging 1 Wor-d ftom 
thence t* hiatUie 4a*d, was naUdfep mere* f© ; that itttiey 
met with any 'Antwer, or^fpoke- withlamy ohe thdrti** it

©f the World to be worfhip'd inftead of God, and as Godf 
and the many Stratagems he made ufe of^ to delude 
Mankind to their Ruin ;•• how he had a fecret Acceis to 
our Pailions, and to our AiFe&ions, to adapt his Snares 
io to cur Inclinations, as to caufe us even to be our own 
Tempters, and to run upon our own Deftru&ion by our 
own Choice. 

I found it was not Co eafy to imprint right Notions in 
his Mind about the Devil, as it was about the Being of 
a God : Nature aflifted all my Arguments to evidence 
to him even the Neceffity of a great firft Caufe, and 
over-ruling governing Power, a iecret v dire&ing Pro- 
vidence, and of the Equity and JuiUce of paying Ho- 
mage to him that made us, and the like : But there ap» 
pear'd nothing of all this in the Notion of an evil Spi- 
rit, of his Original, his Being, his Nature, and above 
all, of his Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us into 
do fo too : And the poor Creature puxxled me once in 
iuch a manner, by a Queftion merely natural and inno- 
cent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to him? : I had 
been talking a great deal to him of the Power of God, 
his Omnipotence, his dreadful Averiion to Sin, his be^ 
ing a confuming Fire to the Workers of Iniquity ; how, 
as he had made us all, he could deftroy us and all the 
World in a Moment; and he liften'd with great Seri- 
oufnefs to me all the while. 

After this, I had been telling him bow the Devil 
was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and us'd all 
his Malice and Skill to defeat the good Deiigns of Pro- 
vidence, and to ruin the Kingdom of Chrifl: in the 
World, and the like : Well, fays Friday, but you fay, 
God is fo ftrong, ^o great, is he not much ftrong, much 
might as the Devil ? Yes, yes, fays I, Friday, God is. 
ftronger than the Devil,God is above theDevil,and there 
fore we pray to God to tread him under our Feet, and 
enable us to refift his Temptations, and quench his fie- 
ry Darts. But, fays he again, if God much fir ong, much 
mr^ht as the Devil, why Gcd no kill the Devil y fo make 
him no more wicked ? 

I was ftrangely furpriz'd at his Queftion, and after at?, 
tho* I was now an old Man, yet 1 was but a young 
I>o&or, and ill enough qualified for a Cafuift, or a Sol-, 

Yer

vor of Difficulties: And, at firft, I could not tell whatf 
to lay ; Co I pretended not to hear him, and ask'd him 
what he laid i But he was too earneft for an Anfwer to 
forget his Queftion ; fo that he repeated it in the very 
lame broken Words, as above. By this time I had re- 
Cover'd my Celt a little, arid I faid, God will at lafl prmijb 
him feverelfy he is referv*d for the 'Judgment, and is to 
be cafl into the bottomless Pit, to dwell with everlafling 
Fire : This did not fatisfy Friday, but he returns upon 
me, repeating my Words, Referve at Lafl, me no un- 
derjiand \ But vobf mt kill the Devil now, not kill great a» 
go ? You may as well ask me, [aid J, why God does not 
kill you and I, when we do wicked things here that of- 
fend him : We are preferred to repent and be pardon'd. 
He mutes a while at this \ Well, well, lays he, mighty 
affectionately, that well \ foyou, 1, Devil, all wicked, all 
preferve, repent, God pardon all : Here I was run down 
again by him to the lad degree, and it was a Teftimo- 
ny to me, how the mere Notions of Nature, tho' they 
will guide reafonable Creatures to the Knowledge of a 
God> and of a Worflrip or Homage due to the Supreme 
Being of God, as the Confequence of our Nature ; yet 
nothing but Divine Revelation can form the Knowledge 
of yefm Chrijf 9 and of a Redemption purchas'd for us ; 
of a Mediator of a new Covenant, and of 1 an Intercef- 
for, at the Footifcool of God's Throne ; I fay, nothing 
but a Revelation from Heaven can form thefe in the 
Soul«, and that therefore the Gofpel of our Lord and 
Saviour Jefas Chrift, I mean* the Word of God, and 
the Spirit of God, promifed for the Guide and Sanftifi- 
er of his People, are the abfolutely neceftary Inftru&ors 
of the Souls of Men in the faving Knowledge of dod, 
and the means of Salvation. 

I therefore diverted the prefent Difcourfe between me 
and my Man, rifing up haftily, as upon fome fudden 
Occafion of going out ; then lending him for fomething 
a good way- off, I ferioufly pray'd to God, that he 
would enable me to inftru& favingly this poor Savage, 
affifting by his Spirit the Heart, of the poor ignorant 
Creature, to receive the 5 Light of the Knowledge of God 
ih Chrift, Reconciling him to himfelf, and would guide 
me to fpeak Co to him from the Word of God, as his 

Con- 



( «• ) 

Confcience might be corivinc'd, his Eyes open*d, and 
his Soul fav*d : When he came again to me, I enter'd 
into a long Difeoude with him upon the Subje& of 
the Redemption of Man by the Saviour of the World, 
and of the Uoftrine of the Gofpel. preachM from Hea- 
ven, vi%, of Repentance towards God, arid Faith in our 
blefled Lord -Jeju$ : I then explained to him, as well as 
I could, why our bleiFed Redeemer took not on him, 
the Nature^ of Angels, but the Seed of Abraham, and 
bow for that Reaion the fallen Angels had no Share in 
the Redemption 5 that he came only to the loll Sheep 
of the Houie of Jfrael, and the like. 

I had, God knows, more- Sincerity than Knowledge, 
in all the Methods I took for this poor Creatures ln- 
ftru<5Hon, and mud acknowledge what I believe all 
that 'aft upon the fame Principle will find, that in 
laying Things open to him, I really inform'd and 
inftru&ed my felf in many Things that either I did not 
know, or had not fully conilder'd before ; but which 
t>ccurr'd naturaly to my mind, upon my fearching into 
them, for the Information of this poor Savage ; and I 
had more AfFe&ion in' my Enquiry after Things upon 
this Occasion, then ever I felt before •, lb that whether 
this poor wild Wretch was the better for me or no, I 
had great ; Reafon to be thankful that ever be came to 
me : My Grief fet lighter upon me, my Habitation 
grew comfortable to me beyond meafure, and when I 
refleded that in this fplitary Life which I had been con- 
fin ? d too, I } had not only been movM my felf to look uf> 
to Heaven j and i& feek* to the Hand that brought m& 
there, but was- now to be made an Inftrument, undet 
Providence^ to fa ve the Life, and, for ought J knew, the 
Soul of a- poor Savage, and bring him to the true Know- 
ledge of Religion, and of the Chriftian Do&rine, that 
he might know Chriftjefus, tpknow vohmt is Life eternal* 
I fay, when I refle&ed upon ail thefe things, a fecret 
Jo^ run thro' every Fart of my Soul, a>nd I frequently 
rejoiced thit ever I was brought to this Place, which 
I hadfo often thought the moll dreadful of all Affliftt* 
©as, that could poflt bly bav^ befallen me% 



( *i* ) 

In this thankful Frame I continued all the Remained 
of my Time, and the Converfation which employ'd the 
Hours between Friday and I, was fuch, as made the 
three Years which we liv'd there together, perfe&l) 
and compleatly happy, if any fucb Tbing as cwphai 
Happinefs can be fervid in a fublunary State : T he Sa 
vage was now a good Chriflian, a much better than I j 
tho' I have Reaion to hope, and blefs God for it, that 
we were equally penitent, and comforted reftored Pe 
rutents: We had here the Word of God to read, and nc 
farther off from his Spirit to inftruft, than if we had 
been in England. 

I always apply'd me felf to reading the Scripture, and 
to let him know, as well as I could, the Meaning of what 
I read; and he again, by his ferious Enquiries and 
Qiieftions, made me, as I jaid before^ a much better 
Scholar in the Scripture-Knowledge, than I fhould ever 
have been by my own private meer reading : Another 
thing I cannot refrain from obferving here alfo from Ex- 
perience, in this retired part of my Life, vi\. How in- 
finite and inexpreflible a Bleflingit is, that the Know- 
ledge of God, and of the Doitrine of Salvation byCbrift 
3e}us> is io plainly laid down in the Word of God, io 
eafy to be rcceiv'd and underflood, that as the bare 
reading the Scripture made me capable of undemand- 
ing enough of my Duty to carry me directly on to the 
great.VVork of fincere Repentance for my Sins, and lay- 
ing hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a ftated 
^Reformation in Pra&ice, and Obedience to all God's 
.Commands, and this without any Teacher or Inftru&ori 
( I mean, human ) lb the fame plain Inflru4Hon iuffici- 
ently ferv'd to the eniightning this lavage Creature, 
and bringing him to be fuch a Chriftian, as I have 
known few equal to him in my Life. 

As to the Difputes, Wranglings, Strife, and Conten- 
tion, which has happen'd in the World about Religion, 
whether Niceties in Do&rines, or Schemes of Church- 
CJovernment, they were all pjerfe6Uy ufelefs to us, as Cot 
ought I can yet fee, they have been to all the reft in 
the World : We had the fur e Guide to Heaven, vifc. the 
W 7 ord of God ; and we had, bfeffed be Gcd> comfortable 
.Views of the Spirit of Godj teaching and inftru&ing us 



( «3 ) 

by his Word, hading us into all Truth, and making us 
both willing and obedient to the Inftru&ion ot his 
Word ; and I cannot fee the leaft Ui'e that the greateft 
Knowledge of the difputed Points in Religion, which 
have made fuch Confufions in the World, would have 
been to us, if we could have obtained it: But I mud 
go on with the'Hiftorial Part of Things, and take every 
Part in its Order. 

After Friday and I became more intimately acquaint- 
ed, and that he cculd, underftand almoft all I laid to 
him, and fpeak fluently, tho' in broken English*, to me ; 
I acquainted him with my own Story, or at leaft fa 
much of it as related to my coming into the Place, how 
I had liv'd there, and how long ; I let him into the 
Myflery ( for fuch it was to him ) of Gunpowder and 
Bullet, and taught him how toihoot: I gave him a 
Knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and 
I made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, ftich as 
in England lyre wear Hangers in; and in the Frog, in- 
ftead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which was 
not! only as good a Weapon in fome Cafes, hut much 
more ufeful upon many Occaflons. 

I defcrib'd to him the Countrys of Europe, and parti- 
cularly England, which I came from * y how we liv'd, 
taw we worfhip'd God, how we behav'd to one ano- 
ther ; and how we traded in Ships to all the Parts of 
the World : I gave him an Account of the Wreck which 
1 had been on board of, and fhew'd him as near as I 
could the Place where fhe lay ; but flie was all beaten 
in Pieces long before, and quite gone. 

I fhew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we kft 
when we><fcap'd, and which I could not ftir with my 
whole Strength then, but was now fallen almoft all to 
Pieces : Upon feeing this Boat, Friday ftood mufing a 
great while, and faid nothing ; I ask'd him what it 
was he ftudied upon; at laii, lays he, me fe-e fuch Beat 
like come t$ Place at my Nation* 

I did not underftand him a good while; but at laft, 
when I had examin'd further into it, I underftood by 
him, that a Boat, fuch as that had been, came on fhore 
&Pon the Country where he liv'd, that is, as he ex. 
plain'd it, was driven thither by Strcfs of Weather: I 

prefent- 



C 21 4 ) 

jprefendy imagtrfd, that fome Eurofem Shjyl fflttft have 
l>een caft away upon .their Cpaft, aad the Boat xingk 
get loofe, and drive. a?(hore, but was £o dull, .that I ne- 
ver; once, thought of Men making efcape from a Wreck 
thither 5 much left whence they might come ; fo l only 
enquired after a Defcription of the Boat. 

Friday defcrib*d the Boat to me well enough ; but 
brought me better to underftand him, when he added, 
with fome Warmth, Wefave the white Mans from drown : 
Then I prefently ask'd him, if there were any while 
Mans, as he call'd them, in the Boat? Tex, he laid, 
the Beat full- cf white ,AJans : .- I askM him how many? 
He told upon his Fingers Teventeen. I ask'd him then 
what became of 'em ? He told me, They live, ikzy dwd 
at my Nation* 

This put new Thoughts, into my Head again ; for I 
prefently imagin'd, that thefe might, be the JVi=en belong- 
ing to the Ship that was call: away in fight of any ifland, 
as I now call it ;" and who, after the, 2>hip..-was ftruck 
0^1 the Rock, and they law her inevitably; fou^ had fav ! d 
themfelyes in their, Boa*;, fand were landed upon that 
wild Shore, among the Savages* 

Upon this, I enquired of him more critically, what 
was become of them ; he aSiir'd me they Jiv'd ftill there; 
that they had been there about four Years; that the Sa- 
vages let them alone, and gave them Vi&uals to live: 
I ask'd him, how it came to pafs they did not kill them 
and eat them ? He faid, No, they make Brother wilb 
them\ that is, as I underftood him, a Truce: And then 
he added, They no eat Mans but when make the War 
fght: That is to fay, they never eat any Men, but fiich 
as come to fight with them, and are taken In Battel. 

It was after this, fome coniiderable Time, that being 
op the Top of the Hill, at the Eaft fide of the Ifland, 
from whence, as I have faid, I had in a clear Day dif* 
cover'4 the Main or Continent of America^ Friday, the 
Weather being very ferene 9 looks very caruelliy to- 
wards the main Land, and in a kind of Surprize falls 
a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me, for I was 
at fome Diftance from him: I ask'd him what w;as the 
Matter; OJy! fays he, Glad J There fee nq G>m\

'('"5 V 

I ©b&rv'd an extraordinary Senie of Pleafure appear*^ 
in his Face, and his Eyes fpark led, and his Countenance 
difcover'd a flrange Eager nefs, as if he had a Mind to 
be in his own Country again j and this Observation of 
mine put a great many Thoughts into me, which made 
me at firil not fo eafy about my new Man Friday y as I 
was before ; and I made no doubt, but that if Friday 
could get back to his own Nation again, he would not 
only forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to 
me ; and would be forward enough to give his Coun- 
trymen an Account of me, and come back perhaps, 
with a Hundred or two of them, and make a Feafl: upon 
me, at which he might be as merry as he ufed to be 
with thole of his Enemies, when they were taken in 
War. 

But T wrong'd the poor honed Creature very much, 
for which 1 was very forry afterwards : However as 
my Jealoufy increas'd, and held me fbrne Weeks, 1 was 
a little more circumfpe&, and not fo familiar and kind 
to him as before *, in which I was certainly in tfee wrong 
too, the honeft: grateful Creature having no Thought 
about it, but what conflfled with the belt Principles, 
both as a religious Chriilian, and as a grateful Friend, 
asappear'd aiterwards to my full Satisfaction. 

While my Jealoufy of him lafted, you may. be fure I 
was every Day pumping him to fee if he would diico- 
yer any of the new Thoughts, which I fufpe&ed were 
in him \ but \ found every thing he faid was fo honeft, 
and fo innocent, that I could find nothing to nquriih 
niy Sufpiciofc; and, in fpite of all my Oneafinefs, he 
made me at laft entirely his own again \ nor did he 
in the leafl perceive* that I was uneafy, and therefore 
I could not fulped him of Deceit. 

One Day, walking, up the fame Hill, but the Wea- 
ther being hazy at bea, ib, that we could not fee the 
Continent, I calPd to him, and faid, Friday^ do not 
you wiih your felf in yqur own Country, your own 
Nation ? Tes> he faid, : I be much glad to be at my own 
Nation: What would you do there, faid I, would you 
turn wild again, eat Mens Flefh again, and be a Sa- 
vage as ybu were before? He look'd full of Concern, 
and iuaking his Head, faid, No 9 w>, Friday tell tb&n to 

live 



( «*) .. 

the good, tell them to pray God, tell them to eat Corn* 
bread, Cattle-fiejb, Milk i> no eat Man again : Why then, 
faid I to him, They will kill you : He look'd grave at 
that, and then faid, No y they no kill me, they willing 
Jove learn : He meant by this, they would be willing to 
learn ; He added, they learnM much of the bearded 
Mans that came in the Boat: Then I ask'd him, if he 
would go back to them ? He fmil'd at that, and told 
me he could not fwim fo far •, I told him I would 
make a Canoe for him ; He told me, he would go, if I 
would go with him. I go ! fays I, why, they will eat 
me if I come there ; No, no, fays he, me make they no 
eat ycu, me make they much love you: He meant, he 
would tell them how I had killed his Enemies, and fav'd 
his Life, and fo he would make them love me : Then 
lie told me, as well as he could, how kind they were to 
fcventeen white Men, or bearded Men, as be oall'd 
them, who came on Shore there in Diftrefs. 

From this Time, I confefs, I had a mind to venture 
over, and fee if I could poffibly join with thefe beard- 
ed Men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards or Per 
tuguefe ; not doubting but, if I could, we might find 
Come Method to efeape from thence, being upon the 
Continent, and a good Company together, better than 
I could from an Illand forty Miles off the Shore, and a- 
lone without help : So, after fome Days, I took Frida) 
to work again, by way of Difcourfe ; and told him, 1 
would give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation; 
and accordingly I carry'd him to my Frigate, which 
lay on the other Side of the Ifland, and having clear'd 
it of Water ( for I always kept it funk in the Water) I j 
■brought it out, fhew'd it him; and we both went into it. 
I found he was a mbft dextrous Fellow at managing 
it, would make it go almofl: as fwift and fafl; again as I 
'Could ; fb when he was in, I- laid to him, Well, now, | 
Friday, fhall w r e go to your Nation ? He look'd very ! 
'dull at my faying (c, which, it feems, was becaufe he 
thought the Boat too fmall to go ib far : I told him then 
I had a bigger ; fo the next Day \ went to the Place 
where the firft Boat lay which I had made, but which 
I could not get into the Water ", he faid that was big 
enough j but then, as I had taken no Care. of it, and it 

had 



( "7 ) 



tiad lain two or three and twenty Years there 5 the Suit 
had fplit and dry'd it, that it was in a manner rotten. 
Friday told me, luch a Boat would do very well, and 
would carry much enough VHiU^ JDrink^ Bread, that 
was his way of Talking. 

Upon the Whole, I was by this Time Co fixMupon 
my Defign of going over with him to the Continent, 
that I told him we would go and make one as big as 
that, and he fhould ,go home in it. He aniwer'd not 
one Word, but look'd very grave and fad,? I ask'd him 
what was -the Matter with him - r he ask'd me again 
thus, Why you angry mad with Friday, what me d tie ? 
I ask'd him what he meant; I told him I was not an- 
gry with him at all : No angry! N? angry! fays he, re- 
peating the Words feveral times, Why fend Friday home 
away to m % y Nation ? W hy, fays I, Friday,, did you not 
fay you wifh'd you were there ? Tes, yes, fays he, 
wifk be both there ; no with Friday there, no Aloft er there. 
In a word, he would -not think of going there without 
me: I go there, Friday, fays I, what fhall I do there? 
He turn'd very cjutck upon me at this: Tcu do great 
deal much Good, fays he, ycu teach wild Mans be good 
jober tame Mans \ you tell them know God, pray Gcd, and 
live new Life : Alas, Friday, fays I, thou knoweft not 
what thou fay'ft, I am but an ignorant Man my felf. 
Tes, yes, lays he, you teach le me Goody you teachee them 
Good* No, no, Friday, fays I, you fhall go without 
ms, leave me fe to live by my fejf, as 1 did before; 
He look'd confus'd again at that Word, *nd running to 
<>ne of the Hatchets, which he us'd to wear, he takes 
it up haftily, and gives it me ; what muft I do with 
this^ fays I to him; Tcu take £/X Friday, fays he : 
What muft I kill you for ? faid I again \ He returns 
very quick, What you fend Friday away for ? take kill 
Friday, no fend Friday away ; This he fpoke io ear- 
nellly, that I favv Tears (land in his Eyes: In a word, 
I ib plainly difcover'd the utmoft AfFeaion in him to 
me, and a firm Refolution in him, that I told him 
then, and often after, that I would never fend him away 
from me, if he was willing to (lay with me. 

Upon the whole, as I found by all his Difcourfe a 
fettled Affe&ion to me, and that nothing ftould part 

k him 



( «8<) 

'Mm from me, fo'I found all the Foundation of his De- 
ilre to go to his own Country, was laid in his ardent 
AfFe&ion to the People, and his Hopes of my doing 
them good; a Thing, which as I had no Notion of 
my felt, fo i had not the leail Thought, or Intention, or 
Defire of undertaking it : But rtill I found, a ftrong 
Inclination to my attempting an Efcape, as above, 
founded on the Supposition gather'd from the fbrmerDif- 
courfe, vi%. That there were feventeen bearded Men 

^ there, and therefore, without any Delay, I went to work 
with Friday, to find out a great Tree proper to fell, 

' and make a large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the 

• Voyage : There were i rees enough in the Ifland to 
have built a little Fleet, not of Periagua' s and Canoes 
only, hut even of good large Veflels: But the mainThing 
1 look'd at, was to get one fo near the Water that we 
might launch it when it was made, to avoid the Miftake 
I committed at firft. 

At laft, Friday pitch'd upon a Tree ; for I found he 
knew much better than I, what kind or* Wood was fit- 
ted for it ; nor can I tell, to this Day, what Wood to 
call the Tree we cut down, except that it was very like 
the Tree we call Fuflic, or between that and the Nfea* 
raguaWood, for it was much of the fame Colour &nd 
Smell : Friday was for burning the Hollow or Cavity 
of this Tree out, to make it into a Boat: But I fhew'd 
Mm how rather to cut it out with Tools, which after I 
ihewM .him how to ufe, he did very handily, and in 
about a Month's hard Labour we finiih/d it, and made 
it very handfdme, efpecially when with our Axes, 
■which I fhew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd 
the Out-fide into the true Shape of a Boat ; after this, 
however, it coft us near a Fortnights Time to get 
her along, as it were, Inch-by Inch upon great Rowl- 
crs into the Water ; But when fhe was in, file would 

. have carried twenty Men with great Eafe. 

When {he was in the Water, and tho* Hie was. fo big, 
it amal'd me to fee with what Dexterity and how fwift 
my Man Friday would manage her, turn her, and pad- 
dle her along; foi ask'd him if he would, arid' if we 
might venture over in her ; Tes, he faid>fo venter over in 

- frer mry-wtil % thwgb great b\m Wind \ However, 1 had j 



( 219 ) 

a farther Deflgn that "he knew nothing of, and that 
was to make a Maft and Sail, and to tic her with an 
Anchor and Cable : As to a Mail, that was eafy enough 
to get y ib I pitch'd upon a ftrait young Cedar-Tree, 
which I found near the Place, and which there was 
great Plenty of in the [(land *, and I fet Friday to work 
to cut it down, and gave him Dire&ions how to fliap e 
^nd order it : But as to the Sail, that was my particu- 
lar Care ; I knew I had old Sails, or rather 1 ieces of 
old Sails enough ; but as I had them now 26 Years by 
me, and had not been very careful to preferve them, 
not imagining that I fhould ever have this kind of ufe 
for them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten \ and 
indeed moft of them were fb \ however, J found two 
Pieces which appear'd pretty good, and with thefe I 
went to work, and with a great deal of Pains, and auk- 
ward tedious ftitching ( you may be fure ) for Want of 
Needles, I at length made a thre^-cornerM ugly Thing, 
like what we call in England, a Shoulder, of -Mutton- 
Sail, to go with a Boom at Bottom, and a little ihort 
Sprit at the Top, (Uch as ufually our Ships Long-Boa ts 
ia|l with, and fuch as I bed knew how to manage ; be- 
caule it was fuch a one as I had to the Boat in which I 
made my Efcape from Barbary, as related in the firft 
Part of my Story. 

I was near two Months performing this laft Work, 
vi^ rigging and fitting my Maft and Sails ; for I fi- 
nilh'd them very com pleat, making a (mall Stay, and a 
Sail, or Forefail to it, to ailill, if we fhould turn to 
Windward', and which was more than all, I fix'd a 
Rudder to the Stern of her, to fteer with ; and tho* 
I was but a bungling Shipwright, yet as 1 knew the 
Uiefulnefs, and even Neceifity of fuch a Thing, l applied 
my ielf with lo much Pains to do it, that at laft [ 
brought it to pafs, tho' confldering the many dull Con- 
trivances I had for it that faifd, I think it coft me al- 
moil as much Labour as making the Boat. 

After all this was done, I had my Man. Friday to 
teach as to what belonged to the Navigation of my Boat; 
for tho' he knew very well how to paddle the Canoe, 
he knew nothing what belonged to a Sail and a Rudder, 
4nd was the moft amaz'd when he faw me work the 
L 2 Boat 



( 220 ) 

Boat too and .again in the Sea by the Rudde:*, and how 
the Sail gyb'd, and fill'd this Way or that Way, as the 
Courfe, we fail'd, chang'd *, I fay, when he law this, 
he ilood like one aftoniih'd and amax'd : However, 
with a little Ufe, I made all thefe Things fan>iliar to 
him, and he became an expert Sailor, except that as to 
the Com pais, I could make him underhand very lit- 
tle of that : On the other Hand, as there was very 
little cloudy Weather, and feldom or never any Fogs in 
thole Parts, there was the lefs Occalion tor a Corn- 
eals, ieeing the Stars were always to be feen by Night, 
and the Shore by Day, except in the rainy Seaions, 
and then no Body cared to ftir abroad, either by Land 
or Sea. 

I was now enter'd on the feven and twentieth Year 
of my Captivity in this Place ; though the three laft 
Years that I had this Creature with me, ought rather 
to be left out of the Account, my Habitation being 
quite of another kind than in all the reil of the Time. 
1 kept the Anniverfary of my landing here with the 
fame Thankfulnefs to God for his Mercies, as at firft ; 
and if I had fuch Cauie of Acknowledgment at firft, 
I had much more fo now, having fuch additional Te- 
stimonies of the Care of Providence over me, and the 
great Hopes I had of being e/fe&ually and fpeedily de- 
iiver'd ; for I had an invincible Impreflion upon my 
Thoughts, that my Deliverance was at hand, and that 
I iho&ld "not be another Year in this Place : However, 
I went on with my Husbandry, digging, planting, 
fencing, as ufkal ; I gather'd and cur'd my Grapes, and 
did every neceflary Thing, as before. 

The rainy Seafon was in the mean time upon me, 
when I kept more within Doors than at other Times ; 
ib I had ftow'd our new Veffel as fecure as we could, 
bringing her up into the Creek, where, as I faid in 
% he Beginning, I landed my Rafts from the Ship, and 
Jialing her up to the Shore, at high Water Mark, I 
made my Man Friday dig a little Dock, juft big enough 
to hold her, and juft deep enough to give her Water 
enough to float in ; and then, when the Tide was out, 
we made a ftrong Dam crofs the End of it, to keep 
the Water out; and ib Ihe lay dry, as to the Tide, 

from 



( »I ) ,-■ 

from theSea;and to keep theRain off, we laid a great ma- 
ny Boughs of Trees fo thick, that {he was as weii thatch- 
ed as a Houfe ; and thus- we waited for the Month of 
November and December \, in which I defign'd to make 
my Adventure. 

When the fettled Seafon began to come in, as the 
Thought of my Ddign return'd with the fair Weather, 
$ was preparing daily for the Voyage ; and the firft 
Thing L did, was to lay by a certain Quantity of Pro- 
visions, being the Stores for our Voyage ; and intended, 
in a Week or a Fortnight's Time, to open the Dock, 
and launch out our Boat : I was buly one Morning up- 
on fomething of this kind, when I calPd to Friday , and 
bid him go to the Sea-fhore, and fee if he could iind a 
Turtle, or Tortoife, a Thing which we generally got 
once a Week, for the fake of the Eggs, as well as the 
Ffeih; Friday had not been long gone, when he came 
running back, and flew over my outer Wall, or Fence, 
like one that felt not the Ground, or the Steps he fet his 
Feet on ; and before I had Time to fpeak to him, he cries 
out to me, Mafier! Mafier! OS mwl Obad! What's 
the Matter, Friday? fays I \ yonder there , lays he, one y 
two, three Canoe ! one, two, three I By this- way of fpeak- 
ingl concluded there were fix \ but on Enquiry I found 
it was but three : Well, Friday' fays I, do not be fright- 
ed ; fo I heartned him up as well as I could : However, 
I faw the poor Fellow was moil terribly feared ; tor no- 
thing ran in his Head but that they were come to look 
for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat him ; 
and the poor Fellow trembled (o, that I fcarce knew 
what to do with him : I comforted him as- well as I 
could, and told him t was in as much Danger as- he, 
and that they would eat me as well as him ^ but, fays 
I, Friday roe mufl tefolve to fight them\ Can you fight , 
Friday ? Mejhoct, fays he, but there come many qreat 
Number* No matter for that, faid I again, our Guns 
will fright them that we do not kill ; fo 1 ask'd him, 
Whether if I refolv'd to defend him 3 he would defend 
me, and (land by me, and do juft as I bid him ? He faid, 
Me die, when you bid die, Mafier ; fo I went and fetch'd 
a, good Dram of Rum, and gave him; for I had teen lot 
good a Husband ofony Rum, that I had a great-deal left ; 

L 3 When, 



( 222 ) 



When he had drank it, I made him take the two Fow 
ling-Keces which we always carry'd, and load them 
with large Swan-Shot, as big as fmall Piftol Bullets ; 
then 1 took four Muskets, and loaded them with two 
Slugs, and five fmall Bullets each; and my two Piftols 
1 loaded with a brace of Bullets each : I hung my great 
Sword as ufual, naked by my fide, and gave 'Friday his 
Hatchet. 

V< hen I had thus prepar'd my felf, I took my Per- 
fpe&ive Glafs, and went up to the fide of the Hill, to 
fee what I could d Hoover *, and I found quickly, by my 
Glafs, that there were one and twenty Savages, three 
Prisoners, and t\\xttCanocs ;and that their whole Bufinefs 
feemed to be the triumphant Banquet upon thefe three 
human Bodies, (a barbarous Feaft indeed) but nothing 
iRore than as 1 had obierv'd was ufual with them. 

I ohierved alio, that they were landed not where they 
l|ad done when Friday made his Efcape, but nearer to 
my Creek, where the Shore was low, and where a thick 
"Wood came clofe almoft down to the Sea : This, with 
the Abhorrence of the inhuman Errand thefe Wretches * 
c#me about, fill'd me with iuch Indignation, that I came i 
clown again to Friday and told him, I .was refolved.to v 
$jp dowe to them, and kill them all ; and ask'd him |f • 
f*e would ftand by me ? He was now gotten over his f 
fright, and- his Spirits being a little rais'd with the 
Dram I had given him, he was very chearful, and told 
me, as before, be would die f when I bid die* 

In this Fit of Fury, I took firft and divided the 
Arms which I had charged, as before, between us : I 
gave Friday one Piftol to ftick in bis Girdle, and three 
Guns upon his Shoulder ; and I took one Piftol, and 
the other three my feif ; and in this Pofture we march'd 
out : t took a fmall Bottle of Rum in my Pocket, and 
gave Friday a large Bag with more Powder and Bullet ; 
and as to Orders, I charg'd him to keep clofe behind me, 
and not to ftir,or fhoot,or do any thing,tilllbidhim;and 
in the mean time, not to fpeak a Word : In this Pofture 
I fetched a Compafsto my Right Hand of near a Mile, 
as well to get over the Creek, as to get into the Wood ; 
fo that I might come within fhot of them before I ihould 
be difcover'd, which I had feen by my Glafs it was eafy 
to do. White 



( "3 )- 

While I was making this March, my former Thoughts 
returning, I began to abate my Reiblution ; I do not 
mean, that I entertained any Fear of their Number ; for 
as they were naked, unarm'd Wretches, 'tis certain I 
was fuperior to them ; nay, though I had been alone ; 
but it oecurM to my Thoughts, What Call? What Oc- 
calion ? much lets, What Neceflity, I was in to go and 
dip my Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had 
neither done or intended me any Wrong ? Who, as to 
me were innonent, and whole barbarous Cufloms were 
their own Difafter, being in them a Token indeed of 
God's having left them, with the other Nations of that 
part of the World, to fuch Stupidity, and to iuch inhu- 
man Couries ; but did not call me to take upon me to 
be a Judge of their Anions, much lefs an Executioner 
of his Juitice ; that whenever he thought fit, he would 
take the Caufe into his own Hands, and by National 
Vengeance puntili them for National Crimes; hut; 
that, in the mean Time, it was none of my Bufinefs; 
that it was true, Friday might juftify it, beeauie he was 
a declared Enemy, and in a ilate of War with thofe ve^ 
ry particular People, and it was lawful for him to at* 
tack them ; but I could not fay the fame with refpecfc 
to me : Thefe Things were lb warmly preis'd upon 
my Thoughts all the Way as I went, that I refolv'd I 
would only go place my felf near them, that I might 
obferve their barbarous Feaft, and that I would a£| 
then as God fliould dire& ; but that unlefs fortieth ing 
crTer'd that was more a Call to me than yet I knew or> 
I would not meddle with them. 

. With this Refolution I entered, the Wood, and 
k with all. poffible Warynefs and Silence (Friday following 
dole at my Heels) I march'd till I came to the Jikirt 
of the Wood, on the Side which was next to them; only 
that one Corner of the W 7 ood lay between me and them : 
Here I caird foftly to Friday , and fhewing him a great? 
Tree, which was juft at the Corner of the Wood, 1 bad 
him go to the Tree, and bring me word if he could fe<| 
there plainly what they were doing; he did fo, and 
came immediately back to me, and told me they might; 
be plainly view'd there j that they were all about the 

h 4 Fire 4 



( 22 4 ) 

Fire, eating the Fleih of one of their Prisoners ^ and 
that another lay bound upon the Sand, a little from 
them, which he laid they would kill next, and which 
fir'd all the very Soul within me : He told me it was 
not one of their Nation, but one of the bearded Men, 
who he had told me ot] that came to their Country in 
the' Boat : I was fiird with Horror at the very naming 
the white. bearded Man, and, going to the Tree, I faw 
plainly, by my Glafs, a white Man, who lay upon the 
Beach of the 3ea, with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with 
Flags, or Things like Rufhes, and that he was an Euro- 
pean , and had Cloaths on. 

There was another Tree, and a little Thicket beyond 
it, about fifty Yards nearer to them than the Place 
where I was, which, by going a little way about, I faw 
I might come at undifcover'd, and that then I fhould be 
within half Shot of them ; lb I with-held my Paflton, 
though I was indeed enrag'd to the higheft Degree, and 
going back about twenty Faces, I got behind fome Bufhes, 
which held all the way, till I came to the other Tree, and 
then I came to a little rifmg Ground, which gave me a 
full View of them, at the Ditlance of about eighty Yards. 

I had now not a Moment to lofe ; for nineteen of 
the dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground all clofe 
liuddled together, and had juft lent the other two to 
butcher the poor Chrtftian, and bring him perhaps Limb 
by Limb to their Fire ; and they were ftoop'd down to 
untie the Bands at his Feet; I tttrn'd to Friday, now, 
Friday \ fold (, do as I Ml thee ; Friday faid he would ; 
then, F*day y fays f, do exa&ly as you fee me do, fail 
in nothing ; fd i fet down one of the Muskets and the 
Fowling. Piece upen the Ground, and Friday did the 
like by his ; and with the other Musket \ took my Aim, 
at the Savages, bidding him do the like ; then asking 
him, if he was ready? he faid, Yes ; then fire at them, 
laid I j and the fame Moment I fir'd al fo. 

Friday took his Aim fo much better than I, that on 
the fide that he fhot, he kill'd two of them, and wound- 
ed three more ; and on my fide, I kill'd one, and wound- 
ed two : They were, you may be fure, in a dreadful Con- 
fternation ; atid all of 'em who were not hurt, jump'durj 
Upon their Feet immediately, but did not know which 

Way 



C 22J ) '"' 

Way to run, or which Way to look ; for they knew not 
from whence their Deftru&ioa came : Friday kept his 
Eyes cloie upon me, that as I had bid him, Be might 
obferve what I did \ io, as foon as the firll Shot was 
made, I threw down the Piece, and took up the Fowl- 
ing-Piece, and Friday did the like ; he fee me cock, and 
preient, he did the fame again ; Are you ready ? Friday^ 
hid I ; yes, fays he ; let Ay then, fays I, in the Name 
of God, and with that I fired again among the amaz,*d 
Wretches, and fo did Friday ; and as our Pieces were now 
loaden with what I call'd Swan-Shot, or fmall Piflol 
Bullets, we found only two drop j but fo many were 
wounded, that they ran about yelling and skreaming 
like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miierably wounded, 
mod of them ; whereof three more fell quickly after, , 
though not, quite dead. 

Now, Friday, fays I, laying down the dilcharg^ Pie-' 
ces, and taking up the Musket, which was yet loaden,' 
follow me, fays I ; which he did, with a deal of Cou* s 
rage ; upon which I rufh'd out of the Wood, and fhew*ct « : 
my felf, and Friday clofe at my Foot: As foon as I per- 
ceiv'd they faw me, I fhouted as loud as I could, and 
bad Friday do fo too ; and runnirig.as fail as I could, 
which by the way was not veryfaji, being loaden with Arms - 
as I was, I made dire&ly towards the poor Vi&im 9 
who, was, as I faid, lying upon the Beach, or Shore, 
between the Place where they fat and the Sea ; the two 
Butchers, who were juft going to work with" him, had 
left him, at the Surprize of our firfl: Fire, and fled in 
a terrible Fright to the Sea-fide, and had jgmp'd into a- 
Canoe, and three more of the reft" made the fame Way ;: 
I turn'd t® Friday, and bid him ftep forwards, and fire 
at them ; he underload me immediately, and running 
about forty Yards to be near them, he fhot at them, 
and I thought he had kilfd them, all : for I faw them all 
fall of a Heap into the Boat ; though I faw two oftheih 
up again quickly : However, he kill'd two of them, and 
wounded the third, fo that he lay down in the Bottom 
of the Boat, as if he had been dead. 

While my Man Friday fir'd at them, I pulM out my 

Rnife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor Victim ^ 

and loofing his Hands and Feet, I lifted him upj and 

- L5 adc'a 



( **<$ ) 

ask'd him in the Pcrtuguefe Tongue, What he was ? He 
aniwev* d MZat in 9 Cbrijtianus ; but was ib weak and 
faint, that he could fcarce (land, or (peak j I took my 
Buttle out of my Pocket, and gave it him, making figns 
that he fhould drink, which he did \ and I gave him a 
JPiece of Bread, which he eat; then I ask'd him, What 
Countryman he was ? And he laid, Ejpagnole \ and be- 
ing a little recover'd, let me know bv all the figns he 
could poilibly make, how much he was in my Debt for 
his Deliverance : Seignhr y laid I, with as much Spanijh 
as I could makeup, we will talk afterwards, but we 
irmft fight now ; if you have any Strength left, take 
this Piltol and Sword, and lay about you : He took 
them very thankfully, and no fooner had he the Arms 
in his Hands, but as if they had put new Vigour into 
him, he flew upon his Murderers like a Fury, and had 
cut two of them in Pieces in an Inftant \ for the Truth 
is, as the whole was a Surprize to them, fo the poor 
Creatures were ibmuch frighted with the Noi e of our 
Pieces, that they fell down for meer Amazement and 
Fear, and had no more Power to attempt their own Ef. 
cape, than their Flefh had to refill our Shot ; and that 
Was the Cafe of thofe five that Friday fhot in the Boat ; 
for as three of them fell with the Hurt they receiv'd, 
jb the other two fell with the Fright. 

I kept my Piece in my Hand ftillj, without firing, be- 
ing willing to keep my Charge ready, becaufe I had given 
the Spaniard my Piltol and Sword ; fo I call*d to Friday, 
and bad him run up to the Tree from; whence we firft 
fir'd, and fetch the Arms which lay there, that had 
been difcharg'd, which he did with great Swiftnefs ; 
and then giving him my Musket, I fat down my felf 
to load all the reft again, and bad them come to me 
when they wanted: While I was loading thefe Pieces, 
there happened a fierce Engagement between the Spam- 
ard and of one the Savages, who made at him with one of 
their great wooden Swords, the fame Weapon that was 
Fo have kill'd him before, if I had not prevented it : 
The Spaniard^ who was as bold and as brave as could 
be imagin'd* tho s weak, had fought this Indian a good 
while, and had cut him two great Wounds on his 
Head { but the Savage being a ftout lufty Fellow, clo- 

fing 



( «7) ''-' 

flrig in with him, had thrown him down (being faint) 
and was wringing my Sword out of his Hand, when 
the Spaniard, tho' undermoft, wifely quitting his Sword, ' 
drew the Pittol from his Girdle, fhot the Savage through 
the Body, andkilFd him upon the Spot, before I, who 
was running to help, him, could come near him. 

Friday being now left at his Liberty, purfu'd the fly- 
ing Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand, but his 
Hatchet •, and with that he difpatch'd thofe three, who 
as I faid before, were wounded at firft and fallen, and 
all the reft he could come lip With ; and the Spaniard 
coming to me for a Gun, I gave him one of the Fowl- 
ing-Pieces, with which he purfu'd two of the Savages, 
and wounded them both ; but as he was not able to run, 
they both got from him into the W 7 ood, where Friday 
purfu'd them, and kill'd one of them ; but the other was 
too nimble lor him ; and tho' he was wounded, yet had 
plung'd into the Sea, and fw am With all his Might off 
to thofe two who were left in the Cance, which three 
in the Cance, with one wounded, who we know not 
whether he dy'd or no, were all that efcap'd our Hands 
of one and twenty. The Account of the reft is as 
follows ; 

3 Kill'd at our firft Shot from the Tree# 
2 Kill'd at the next Shot. 
' 2 Kill'd by Friday in the Boat. 

2 KiilM by t>tttp 9 of thofe at firft wounded* 
1 KiiTd by Ditto; in the. Wood. 

3 Killed by the Spaniard* 

4 Kill'd, being found dropt here and there of their 
Wounds, or kill'd by Friday in his Chace of themv 

4 Efcap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded, if 
not dead.. 

2i In-alK 



Thofe that were in the Canoe, worked hard to get out 
of Gun-fhot ; and tho' Friday made two or three fhofc 
at them, I did not find that he hit any of them ; Fri~ 
dag would fain have had me taken one of their Canoes* 

and 



( 228 ) v 

and purfued them ; and indeed I was very anxious about 
their Efcape, left, carrying the News Home to their 
People^ they iliould come back, perhaps, with two or 
tlfree hundred of their Canoe s> and devour us by meer 
Multitude ; fo I confented to p.urfue them by Sea ; and 
running to one or' their Cances> I jump'd in, and bad 
Friday rollow me ; but when I was in the Canoe, I was 
furprii'd to find another poor Creature lie there alive, 
bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard was, for the 
Slaughter, and almoft dead with Fear, not knowing, 
what the matter was ; for he had not been able to look 
up over the Side of the Boat, he was tied fo hard, 
Neck and Heels, and had been tied fo long, that he 
had really little Life in him. p , 

I immediately cut the twitted Flags, or Rufhes^ 
which they had bound him with, and would have help'd 
him up; but he could not (land, or (peak, but groan'd 
mod piteouily, believing, it feems, (till that he was only 
unbound in order to be kilfd. 

When Friday came to him, I bad him fpeak to him, 
and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling out my 
Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch a Dram, 
which, with the News of his being deliver'd, revived 
him, and he fat up in the Boat ; but when Friday came 
to heat him fpeak, and look'd in his Face, it would 
have moved any one to Tears, to have feen how Friday 
kifs'd him, embraced him, bugg'd him, cry'd, laugh'd, 
hollow'd, jump'd about, danced, fung, then ciy'4 4* 
gain, wrung his Hands, beat his own Face and Head, 
and then fung, and jump'd about again, like a diftra&ed 
Creature: It was a good while, before I could make 
him fpeak to 'me, or tell me what was the matter ; but 
when he came a little to himfelf, he told me that it was 
his Father. 

It is not eafy for me to exprefs how it moved me 
to fee what Extafy and filial Afredion had work'd in 
this poor Savage, at the Sight of his Father, and of bis 
being deliver'd from Death ; nor indeed can I defcribe 
half the Extravagances of his A flexion after this; for 
he went into the Boat and out of the Boat a great many 
times ; When he went in tohinh he would fit down by 
Lim, open his Breaft, and hold his Father's Head clofe 



( 2 29 ) 

to bjsBofom, half an Hour together, to nouriih It $ 
then he took his Arms and Ankles, which were numb'd 
and iliiFwith the binding, and chafed and rubbed them 
with his Hands ^ and 1 perceiving what the Cafe was, 
gave him Tome Rum out of my Bottle, to rub them 
with, which did them a great deal of good. 

This A£ion put an End to our Furfuit of the Canoe, 
with the other Savages, who were now gotten almoll 
out of Sight ', and it was happy for us that we did not ; 
for it blew fo hard wkhin two Hours after, and before, 
they could be gotten a Quarter of their Way, and con- 
tinued blowing fo hard all Night, and that from the 
North-Weft, which was againft them, that I could not 
fuppofe their Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd 
to their own Coaft. 

But to return to Friday, he was fo bufy about his Fa- 
ther, that I could not find in m% Heart to take him off 
for ibrne time ; But after I thought he could 4eave him 
a little, J calFd him to me, and he came jumping and 
laughing, and pleas'd to the higheft Extream : Then I 
ask'd him, If he had given his Father any Bread ? He 
fhook his Head, and faid, None: Ugly Dog eat all up 
felf'\ fa I gave him a Cake of Bread out of a little 
Pouch I carried on purpofe ; I alfo gave him a Dram 
for himfeif, but he would not tafte it, but carried it to 
his Father: I had in my Pocket alfo two or three 
Bunches of my Raifms, lb I gave him a Handful of 
them for his Father : He had no fooner given his Fa- 
ther thefe Raifins, but I faw him come out of the Boat^ 
and run away as if he had been bewitch'd \ he run at 
fuch a rate ; for he was the fwifteft Fellow of his Foot 
that ever I law ; I fay, he run at fuch a rate, that he 
was out of fight, as it were, in an inftant ; and tho' I 
call'd and hollow'd too after him, it was all one, away 
he went, and in a Quarter of an Hour I law him come 
back again, tho' not fa faft as he went \ and as he came 
nearer, I found his Pace was (lacker, becaufe he had , 

fomething in his Hand. -,. / 

When he came up to me, I found he had been quite \^ 
Home for an Earthen Tugg, or Pot, to bring his Fathe* 
fome frefh Water, and that he had got two more Cakes 
or Loaves of Bread; The Bread he gave me, but the 

Water 



C' 2 3° ). 

Water he 'carried to his Father : However, as. I was s 
very thirily too, I took a little Sup of it : This Water 
revived his Father more than all the Rum or Spirits I 
had given him ; for he was juft fainting" with Thirft. 

'When his Father had drank, I'call'd to him to know 
if there was any Water left; he faid, Yes; and I bad 
him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much 
Want of it as his Father; and I fent one of the Cakes, 
that Friday Drought, to the Spaniard too, who was in- 
deed very weak, and was repofing himfelf upon a green 
Place, under the Shade or a Tree, andwhofe Limbs 
were alio very ftiff, and very much fwelfd with the 
rude Bandage he had been tied with : When I faw that 
upon Fridays coming to him with the W 7 ater, he fat 
up and drank, and took the Bread, and began to eat, I 
went to him, and gave him a Handful of Raifins ; he 
look'd up in mv Face with ail the Tokens of Gratitude 
and Thanklulnefs that could appear in any Counten- 
ance; but was Co weak,' not withftanding he had lb ex- 
erted himfelf in the Fight,' that he could not ftaqd up 
upon his Feet;, he tried to do it two or three times, 
but was really notable; his Ankles were fo fwell'dand 
fo painful to him ; fo I bad him fit dill, and caufed 
Friday to rub his Ankles, and bathe them with Rum, as 
he had done his Father's. 

I obferv'd the pporaffe&ionate Creature every twp 
Minutes, or perhaps, lefs^ all the while he was here* 
tiirn'd his Head aboiiti to, fee if his Father was in the 
f^rrie Placq and Pofture as he left him fitting; and at 
lift he fQuhd he, was not to he ieen ; at which he Part- 
ed up, and without fpeaking a Word, flew with that 
Swiftnefs to him, that one could fcarce perceive his 
f ee ; t to touch the Ground as he went : But when he 
^arrie, he only found he had laid himfelf down to eafe 
his Limbs ; Co Friday came back to rrie prefently, and 
I then fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up if 
lie could, and lead him to the Boat, and then he fhoujd 
carry him te our Dwelling, where I would ta}se care of 
Jim: But Friday y a lufty ftrong Fellow, took' the Spa- 
niard quite up upon his Back, and carried him away t^ 
the Boat, ana fet him down foftly upon the Side or 
jpunflri of the Canoe, with his Feet in the Infide of it, 

and 



( *3* ) ■ 

arid then lifted him quite in, and fet him clofe to his 
Father, and prefently ftepping out again, launched the 
Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore f after than £ 
could walk, tho' the Wind blew pretty hard too; fa 
he brought them both fafe into our Creek; and leaving 
them in the Boat, runs away to fetch the other Canoe ; 
As he pals'd me, 1 fpoke to him, and ask'd him, 
whither he went? He told me, Go fetch mete Boat \ Co 
away he went, like the W ind ; for lure never Man or 
Horie run like him, and he had the other Canoe in 
the Creek, almoft as foon as I got to it by Land ; fo he 
wafted me over, and then went to help our new Guefls 
out of the Boat, which he did ; but they were neither 
of them able to walk; fo that poor Friday knew not 
what to do. 

To remedy this, I went to .work in my Thought,, 
and calling to Friday to bid them fit down on the Bank 
while he came to me, I foon made a kind of Hand-Bar- 
row to lay them on, and Friday and 1 carried them up 
both together upon it between us: But when we got 
them to the Out fide of our Wall, or Fortification, we . 
were at a worfe Lois than before ; for it was impoffible 
to get them over \ and I was relblv'd not to break it* 
down : So I let to Work again; and Friday and I, in 
about two Hours Time, made a very handfome Tent, 
cover'd with old Sails, and above that with Boughs of 
Trees, being in the Space without our outward Fence* 
and between that and the Grove of young Wood which, 
I had plantejj : And here we made them' two Beds of 
fuch Things' as I had, vi\. of good Rice-Straw, with . 
Blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover 
them on each Bed. 

My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought my felf 
very rich in Subje&s ; and it was a merry 'Refleftiou. 
which I frequently made, How like a Ring I look'd^ 
Firft of all, the whole Country was my own meer, 
Property ; Co that I had an undoubted Right of Domi? 
nion. 2dly> My People were perfeftly fubjefted: t 
was abfolute Lord and Lawgiver ; they all ow'd theu; 
Lives to me, and were ready to lay down their Lives,* 
if there had been Occafion of it y for me : It was remar- 
kable too, I had but three Subje&s, and they were of 

three 



(. n* > 

three different Religions* My Man Friday was a Pro- 
teflant ; his Father was a Pagan and a Cannibal ; and 
thz-Spamatd was- a Papift: However, I allow'd Liber- 
ty of Confidence throughout my Dominions: But this 
is by the way. 

As foon as I bad fecur'd my two weak refcued Prifo- 
ners, and given them Shelter, and a Place to reft them 
upon, I began to think of making lbme Provifion for 
them: And the firft Thing I did, I order'd Friday to 
take a yearling Goat, betwixt a Kid and a Goat, out of 
my particular Flock, to be kill'd : Then I cut off the 
hinder Quarter j and chopping it into fmair Pieces, I 
fet Friday to Work, to boiling and ftewing, and made 
them a. very good Difh, I allure you, of Flefh and 
Broth, having put fome Barley, and Rice alfo, into the 
Broth ; and asi cook'd it without Doors, ( for I made 
no Fire within my inner Wall, fo I carried it all into 
the new Tent; and having fet a Table there for them, 
I fat down and eat my own Dinner alfo with them,, and, 
as well as I could, chear'd them and encourag'd them : 
Friday being my Interpreter, efpecially to his Father, 
and, indeed, to the Spaniard too ; for the Spaniard fpoke 
the Language of the Savages pretty well. 

After we had dined r or rather flipped, I order'd' 
Friday to take one of the Canoes, and go and fetch our 
Muskets and ether Fire- Arms, which for want of Time 
we had left upon the Place of Battle; and the next 
Day I order'd him to go and bury the dead Bodies of 
the Savages, which lay open to the Sun, and would 
prefently be oflenflve ; and I alfo order'd him to bury 
the horrid Remains of their barbarous Feaft, which £ 
knew were pretty much, * and which I could not think 
of doing my felf ; nay, I could not bear to fee them, if 
I went that Way : All which he punctually performed, 
and defac*d the very Appearance of the Savages being 
there ; fd that when I went again, I could fcarce know 
where it was, otherwife than by the Corner of the 
yfood pointing td the Place. 

I then began to enter into a little Converfation with 
my two new Subje&s; and firft I fet Friday to enquire 
of his Father, What he thought of the Efcape of the 
Savtges in that Canoe, and whether we might expe£ a 

Return 



C 233 ) 

Return of them with a Pewer too greater 11s to reiHr* ?' 
His firft Opinion was, that the Savages in the Boat ne- 
ver could live out the Storm which blew that Night 
they went off, hut muil of Neceffity he drown'd or 
driven South to thofe other Shores, where they were as 
fure to be devour'd as they were to be drowned if they 
were caft away; hut as to what they would do if they 
came fafe on Shore, he laid he knew not ; but it was 
his Opinion that they were (b dreadfully frighted with 
the manner of their being attack'd, the Noife and the 
Fire, that he believ'd they would tell their People, they 
were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not by the 
Hand of Man, and that the two which appear'd, (yi^.y 
Friday and me, were two Heavenly Spirits or Furies 
come down to deftroy them, and not Men with Wea- 
pons: This he faid he knew, becaufe he heard them all 
cry cut lb in their Language to one another ; for it was 
impoffible to them to conceive that a Man could dart 
Fire, and fpeak Thunder, and kill at a Diflance, with- 
out lilting up the Hand, as was done now : And this old 
Savage was in the right; for, as I underftood iince by 
other hands, the Savages of that Part never attempted to 
go over to the Ifland afterwards ; they were fo terrified" 
with theAccounts given by thole fourMen, (for it feems 
they did efcape the Sea ; that they believed whoever 
went to that enchanted Ifland, would be deftroy*d with 
Fire from the Gods. 

This however I knew not, and therefore was under 
continual Apprehenfions for a good while, and kept 
always upon my Guard, me and all my Army ; foras 
we were now four of us, I would have ventur'd upon a 
hundred of them fairly in the open Field at any time. 

In a little time, however, no more Canoes appear- 
ing, the Fear of their coming wore off, and I began to 
take my former Thoughts of a Voyage to the Main into 
Confederation, being llkewife aflur'd by Fridays Fa- 
ther, that I might depend upon good Ufage fromutbetr 
Nation on his Account, if I would go. 

But my Thoughts were a little fufpended, when I 
had a ferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and when I 
Underftood that there were fixteen more of his Coun- 
trymen and Portugefe > who having been caft away, and 

made 



( *34 ) 

itiade their Efcape to that fide, liv'd there at Peace in* 
deed with the Savages, bui were very lore put to it for 
NecefTaries, and indeed for, Life : 1 ask'd him all the 
Particulars, of their Voyage,* and found they were a 
Spanijh Ship, ^ound from the Rig de la Pl4ta y to the Ha- 
vana, being directed to leave their Loading there, which 
was chiefly Hides and Silver, and to bring back what 
European Goods they could meet with there; that they 
had five Portugutfe Seamen on Board, whom they took 
out of another Wreck \ that five of their ovvn Men were 
drown'd when fir 11 the Ship was loft, and that thefe ef- 
cap'd thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards, and arriv'd al^ 
mod ftarv'd on the Cannibal Qoaft, where they expe&ed 
to have been devoured every Moment. 

He told me, they^Jiad fome Arms with them, but they 
wereperfe&ly ufelefs, for that they had neither Pow* 
der or Ball, the Wafhing of the Sea having fpoiPd all 
their Powder, but a little, which they uied at their firft 
Landing to provide themfelves fome Food. 

I ask'd him what he thought would become of them 
there, and if they had form 5 d no Defign of making any 
Efcape : He laid, They had many Confutations about 
it," but that having neither VefTel, nor Tools to build 
one, or Provisions of any Kind, their Cop&fek always 
ended in Tears and Defpair. 

Iask'd him how he thought they would receive a 
Fropofal from me, which might tend towards an Efcape : 
And whether, if they -were all here, it might not be 
done ? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd moftly their 
Treachery and ill Ulage of me, if I put my Life in their 
Hands ; for that Gratitude was no inherent Virtue in 
the Nature of Man ; nor did Men always fquare their 
Dealings by the Obligations they had received, fo much 
as they did by the Advantages they expe&ed : I told* 
him, it would be very hard, that I fhould be the In. 
flrument of their Deliverance, and that they ihould af- 
terwards make me their Priibner in New-Spain, where 
an EngUjbtncin was certain to be made a Sacrifice, what 
NecefHty, or what Accident foever, brought him thi- 
ther : And that I had rather be deliver'dup to the Sa~ 
va$ es i ant ^' oe devour'd alive, than fall into- the merci* 
left Claws,of*the Priefts, and be carry'd into ; the /##**- 

fitkn* 



( *3T ) 



[ition. I added, That otherwife I was perfwaded, if 
they were all here, we might, with Co many Hands, 
build a Bark large enough to carry us all away, either to 
the Brafih Southward, or to the lllands or Spawjh Coaft 
Northward : But that if in Requital they ihould, when 
I had put Weapons into their Hands, carry me by Force 
among their own People, I might be ill ufedi for my 
Kindnefs to them, and make my Cafe worfe than it was 
before. 

He anfvver'd with a great deal of Candor and Inge- 
nuity, That their Condition was io miferable, and they 
were (o fenfible of it, that he believed they would abhor 
the Thought of uiing any Man unkindly that ihould 
contribute to their Deliverance; and that, if I pleafed f 
he would go to them with the old Man, and difcourfc 
with them about it, and return again, and bring me 
their Aniwer : That he would make Conditions withr * 
them upon their folemn Oath, That they would be ab- 
solutely under my Leading, as their Commander and 
Captain j and that they ihould fwear upon the Holy 
Sacraments and Gofpel^ to be true to me, and to go to 
fucli Chriftian Country as I Ihould agree to, and'" 
no other ; and ta bedire&ed -wholly and abfolutely by 
my Orders, till they were handed fafely in fuch Country 
as I intended ; and that he would bring a Contract from 
them under their Hands for that Purpofe. 

Then he told me, he would ftrft fwear to me himfelf, 
That he would never ftir from me as long as he liv'd, 
till I gave him Orders ; and that he would take my 
Side to the laft Drop of his Blood, if there ihould hap- 
pen the leaft Breach of Faith among his Countrymen. 

He told me, they were all of them very civil honed 
Men, and they were under the greateft Diftrefs imagina- 
ble, having neither Weapons or Cloths, nor any Food, 
hut at the Mercy and Discretion of the Savages ; out of 
all Hopes of ever returning to their own Country ; and 
that he was fure, if I would undertake their Relief, they 
wou'd live and die by me. 

Upon thefe AiTurances, I refolv*d to venture to re- 
lieve them, it poflible, and to fend the old Savage and 
this Spaniard over to them to treat : But when he rfad 
gotten all Things in a Readinefe to go, the Spaniard him- 

felf 



C »3* ) 

fttfftlir€ed an Objection, whurh had h much Prudence 
in- it on one Hand, and lb much Sincerity on the other 
Hand,, that I could not but be very well fatisfy 'd in it ; 
and, by his Advice, put off the Deliverance of his Com- 
rades for at leaffc half a Year. The Cafe was thus. 

He had been with us now about a Month *, during 
which. Time I had let him lee in what Manner I had 
pEovided, with the Ailiftance of Providence, for my 
Support ; and he faw evidently what flock of Corn and 
Rice I had laid up ; which, as it was more than fuffi- 
cient for. myfelti lb it was not fufficient, at leaft with- 
out good Husbandry, for my Family, now it was en- 
creas'd to Number lour : But much lefs would it be fuf- 
ficient, if his Countryman, who were, as he laid, four- 
teen dill alive, fliould come over ; and leaftr of all would 
it be fufficient to visual our Veflel, if we fliould build 
one, ior a Voyage to any of the Chriftian Colonies oi 
America, So he told me, he thought it would be more 
advllable, to let him and the two other dig and culti- 
vate ibme more Land, as much as I could (pare Seed to 
fow ; and that we mould wait another Harveft, that 
we might have a Supply of Corn for his Country-men 
when they ihould come ; ror Want might be a Tempta- 
tion to them to difagree, or not to think themfelves de- 
liver'd, otherwife than out of one Difficulty into ano- 
ther : You know, fays he, the Children of Ijrael, though 
they rejpie'd at firft at their being delivered out of Egypt, 
yet rebeU'd even againft God himfelf that deliver'd 
them, when they came to want Bread in the Wildernefs. 

His Caution was (b feafonable, and his Advice fo good, 
that I coueld not but be very well pleas'd with this Pro- 
pafal, as well as I was fatisfy'd with his. Fidelity ; So 
W£ tell to digging all four of us, as well as the wooden 
Tools* we were, furnifhi'd with permitted ; and in about 
a Month's Time 5 by the End ofwbich it was Seed-time, 
we had gotten as much* Land cur'd and trimm'd up, as 
we faw'd 22 Bufhels of Barley on, and 16 JarrsofRice, 
which was, in ftiort, all the Seed we had to fpare ; nor 
indeed did weleasre our felves Barley fufficient for our 
own Food, for the fix Months that we had to expe& our 
Crop, thafci&to jay, reckoning from' the Time we let 

our 



( 237 ) * 

cur Seed aflde for fowing ; for it is not to be fuppos'd II 

is fix Months in the Ground in the Country. 

Having now Society enough, and our Number being 
fufficient to put us out of F ear of the Savages^ if they 
had come, unlefs their Number had been very great, 
we went freely all over the I Hand, where-ever we found 
Occafion •, and as here we had our Efcape or Delive- 
-ranee upon our Thoughts, it was impoffible, atleaft for 
me, to have the Means of it out of mine ; to this Pur- 
poie 9 1 markfd out ieveral Trees, which I thought fit 
tor our Work, and I let Friday and his Father to cutting 
them down ; and then I caus'd the Spaniard, to whom I 
imparted my Thought on that Affair, to overfee and di- 
redt their VVork : 1 ihew'd them with what indefatiga- 
ble Pains I had hew'd a large Tree into fingle Planks, 
and I caus'd them to do the like, till they had mad-e a- 
bout a Dozen large Planks of good Oak, near two Foot 
broad, 35 Foot long, and from two Inches to four In- 
ches thick : what prodigious Labour it took up, any 
one may imagine. 

At the fame Time I contriv'd to encreafe my little 
Flock of tame Goats as much as I could ; and to this Pur- 
pole I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one Day, 
and my felf, with Friday, the next Day, for we took 
cur turns : And by tbis Means we got about 20 young 
Kids to breed up with the reft ; for whenever wefhot 
the Dam, we fav'd the Kids, and added them to our 
Flock : But above all, the Seafon for curing the Grapes 
Coming on, I caus'd luch a prodigious Quantity to be 
hung up in the Sun, that I believe, had we been at A* 
licant, where the Raifins of the Sun are cured, we could 
have fill' d 60 or 80 Barrels ; and thefe, with our Bread, 
was a great Part of our Food, and very good Living too, 
I allure you ; for it is an exceeding nourifbing Food* 
It was now Harveft, and our Crop in good Order ; 
it was not the mod plentiful Encreafe I had ieen in the 
Ifland, but however it was enough to anfwer our End ; 
for from our 22 Bufhels of Barley, we brought in and 
threfhed out above 220 Bulbels, and the like in Propor- 
tion of the Rice, which was Store enough for our Food 
to the next Harveft, tho 5 all the 16 Spaniards had been 
on Sbore with me j or if we had been ready for a Voy-

mgt f It would «vcry plentifully have vi&uall'd our Ship, 
to have carry'd us to any Part of the World, that is U 
j*Jf> of A&mca. When we had thus hcus'd and fecur'd 
"our Magazine of Corn, we fell to Work to make more 
"Wicker- Work, v%. Great Baskets in which we kept 
it* and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at 
this Part, and often blam'd me that I did not make 
fome Things for Defence,of this Kind of Work; butl 
fawnoNeed of it: Arid now having a full Supply of 
Food for. all the Guefts f expe&ed, 1 gave the the Spa- 
niard Leave to go over to the.Main,to fee what he could 
do with thofe he had left behind him there : I gave 
him a itri& Charge in Writing, not to bring any Man 
with him, who would notfiritfwear in the Pretence of 
himfelf and of the old Savage,That he would no Way in- 
jure, fight with, or attack the Perfon he fhould find in 
the Ifland, who was ib kind to fend for them in Order 
to their Deliverance \ but that they would {land by-and 
defend him againft ali fuch Atteraps, and where-ever 
they* went, would be entirely under, and fubje&ed t<5 his 
Command •, and that this fhould be put in Vv riting, and 
fign'd with their Hands : How we were to have this 
done, when 1 knew they had neither Pen or Ink, that, 
indeed, was a Queftion which we never ask'd. 

Under thefe Inllru&ions, the Spaniard, and the old 
Savage (the Father of Friday) went away in one of tfo 
Canoes, which they might be laid to eeme in, or rather 
were brought in, when they came as Prifoners to be de- 
vour'd by the Savages. 

I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock on it 
and about eight Charges of Powder and Ball, charg- 
ing them to be very good Husbands of both, and not to 
uie either of them but upon urgent Occafion. 

This was a chearful Work, being the flril Meafures 

ufed by me in View of my Deliverance for now 27 

Years and fome Days : I gave them Provifions of. Bread, 

and of dry'd Grapes, furHcient for themfelves for many 

. Days, andfufflcient for all their Country- men for about 

„. ^ight Days time ; and wifhing them a good Voyage, 1 
lee them go,* agreeing with them about a Signal they 
feould hang out ^t. their Return by which 1 fhould know 
them again, when they came back, at a Diftance, .before 

t Chey came on Shore. The/

They went away with a fair Gale on the* Day. that 
the Moon was at Full , by my Account in the Month 
of October ; but as for an exadl Reckoning of Days, af- 
ter I had once loft it, I could never recover it again ; 
nor had I kept even the Number of Years ib punctual- 
ly ; as to be fure that I was right, tho', as it prov'd, 
when I afterwards examin'd my Account, I found I had 
kept a true Reckoning of Years. 

It was no lefs than eight Days I had waited for them, 
when a ftrsnge and uniorefeen Accident interven'd, of 
which the like has not, perhaps, been : heard of in Hi- 
ftory. I' was 'fail afleep in my Hutch one Morning, 
when my Man Friday came running in to me, and calPd 
aloud, Mafler^Mafler^ they are come^ they are come* 

I jumped up, and, regardlefs of Danger, I went out 
as loon as I could get my Clothes on, thro' my little 
Grove, which ( by the Way ) was by this Time grown 
to be a very thick Wood : I fay, regardlefs of Danger, 
I went without my Arms, which was not my Cuflom 
to do ; but I was furpriz'd, when turning my Eyes to 
the Sea, I preiently law a 'Boat at about a League and 
Half s Diftance, itanding in for the Shore, with a 
Shoulder* of -Mutton- Sail> as they call it, and the W ind 
blowing pretty fair to bring them in: Alfo I obferv'd 
preiently, that they did not come from that Side which 
the Shore lay on, but from the Southermofl End of the 
I (land J- Upon this I call'd Friday in, and bid hifn lye 
cloie, for thele were not the People we look'd for, and 
that we might not know yet whether they were Friends 
or Enemies. 

In - the nexrPlace, I went in to fetch myPerfpe&ive- 
Glafs, to fee what I could make of them ; and having 
tal^en the Ladder out, I climb' d up to the Top of the 
Hill, as I ufed to do when I was apprehenilve of any 
Thing, and to take my View the plainer without be- 
ing dilcover\d. * ' '.","• 
- I'had icarce-fetmy Foot on the Hill, when ni^fSye 
plainly, dilcbver'tr a; Ship lying 1 at an Anchor, at, about 
two;L^gues*ahd .an Half's Diftahce from me ft $, l E. 
but'not above a 1 League and an half from the Shcrfe." JSy 
my Obfervation it appeared plainly to be an Ejigtijh 
Ship, ^nd the Boat appeared to b&ln-Engiijb Long-Boat. 



( Ho ) 

I cannot cxprefs the Confufion I was i», tho' the. Joy 
«f feeing a Ship, and one whom I had Reafon to believe 
was Mann'd by my own Country-men, and confequent- 
ly Friends, was fuck as I cannot dcfcribe ; but yet I 
had fome Secret Doubts hung about me, I cannot tell 
from whence they came, bidding me keep upon my 
Guard : In the firft Place, it occur'd to me, to con- 
sider what Bufinefs an Eng ijh Ship could have in that 
Part of the World, fince it was not the Way to, or 
from any Part of the World, where the EngUJb had any 
Traffick \ and I knew there had been no Storms to drive 
them in there, as in Diflrefs ; and that if they were 
Englijh really, k was mofl probable that they were here 
upon no good Defign j and that I had better continue 
as I was, than fall into the Hands of Thieves and Mur- 
therers. 

Let no iVTan defpife the fecret Hints and Notices of 
Danger, which fometimes are given him when he may 
think there is no Poflibility of its being real : That 
fuch Hints and Notices are given us, I believe few that 
have made any Oblervations of Things can deny ; that 
they are certain Diicoverks of an invifible World, and 
a Converfe of Spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the 
Tendency of them feems to be to warn us of Danger, 
why fhould we not fuppofe they are from forne friend- 
ly Agent, C whether iupreme, or inferior and fubordi- 
nate, is not the Qtieftion) and that they are given for 
our Good P 

The prefent Queftion abundantly confirms me in the 
JufHce of this Reafoning ; for had I not been made 
cautious by this fecret Admonition, come it from whence 
it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far 
worfe Condition than before, as you will fee prefently. 

I had not kept my felflong in this Pofture, but I 
faw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they look'd for 
a Creek to thruft in at for the Convenience of Land- 
ing \ however, as they did not come quite far enough, 
they did not fee the little Inlet where I formerly landed 
my Rafts ; but run their Boat on Shore upon the Beach, 
at about half a Mile from me, which was very happy 
for me ; fur otherwife they would have landed juft, as 
I may fay, at my Door, and would foon have beaten 

me 



( 2 4 T ) 

mz out t>f my Caflle, and, perhaps, have plunder'd me 
of all "I had. 

When they were on Shore; I was fully fatisfied they 
were Englijh Men, at leair. mod of them; one or two £ 
thought were Dutch y but it did not prove lo : There 
were in all eleven Men, whereof three oi them 1 found 
were unarm'd, and (as I thought.) bound, and when 
the firit four or five ot them were jump'd on Shore, they 
took tlioie three out of the Boat as Priibners: One of 
the three I, could perceive uiing the moltpailionateGefi. 
tures of Entreaty, AfBi&ion, and Dei pair, even to a 
kind of Extravagance ; the other two, 1 could perceive, 
lifted up their Hands ibmetimes, and appeared concern'd 
indeed, but not to fuch a Degree as the firil. 

I was perfe&ly confounded at the Sight, and knew 

not what the Meaning of it fhould be : Friday caiFd out 

fy me in ErigUfi, as well as he could, Majtsr I Tvuftc 

^\glifu Mans eat Prifoncr as vsiU Savage frlans : Why>

fjl you may be fure they will not eat them. 
^ms while 1 had ^o Thought of wliat the Matter 
' W was, but flood trebling with the Horror of the 
jft, expe&ing every Moment when the three Frifo- 
Ifhouldbekiu'd; nay, once I faw one of the Vil- 
L .lift up his Arm with a great Cutlafli, (as the Sea-

|tve come undifcover'd within Shot of them, that I 

/ ^ have refcu'd the three Men ; for I faw no Fire- 

-y had among them, but it fell out to my Mind 

Way.

aft three upon the ground very penfiye, and looked like 
.Men in Dei pair. 

This put me in Mind of the firft Time when I came 
on Shore, and began to look about me ; how I gave my 
Jelf over for loft, now wildly I ;look'd round me, what 
dreadful Apprehenfions 1 had, and how I lodged in the 
Tree all Night for fear of being devoured by wild Beafts. 
As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I was to 
receive by the providential Driving of the Ship nearer 
the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by which I have 
jGnce been fo long nouriftVd and fupported; fo thefe 
three poor defolate Men knew nothing how certain of 
Deliverance and Supply they were, how near it was to 
&hem, and how effe&ually and really they were nra Con- 
dition of Safety, at the fame Time that they thought 
/themfelves loft, and their Cafe defperate. 

So little do we fee before us in the World, and fo 
much Reafon have we to depend chearfully upon the 
great Maker of the Wjorld, that he does not leave his 
< Creatures fo abfolutely deilitute, but that in the worft 
Circumftartces they have always fomething to be thank- 
ful for, and fometimes are nearer their Deliverance than 
:they imagine ; nay, are even brought to their Deliver- 
ance by the Means by which they feeni to be brought t© 
their Deftru&ion. 

It was juft at the Top of High- water when thefe Peo- 
ple came on Shore, and while partly they flood partying 
Avith the Prifoners they brought, and partly while they 
rambled about to fee what kind of Place they were in^ 
they had carlefsly ftaid till the Tide was fpent, and the 
Water was ebb'd confiderably away, leaving their Boat 
.a-ground. 

They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I found 

afterwards, having drank a little too much Brandy, fell 

a fleep ^however, one of them waking fooner than the 

ether, andifinding: the Boat too fall a-ground for him to 

Mr it, hallo w'd for the reft who were draggling about, 

mpan which they all foon came to the Boat \ but it was 

-J5aft all their Strength to launch her, the Boat being ve- 

ay heavy, and the Shore on that fide being a foft oozy 

:fiand, ahnoii like a Qirick-SancU 

In 



( 243 ) • . 

In this Condition, like true Seamen, who are, per- 
haps, the leaft of all Mankind given to Fore-thought, 
they gave it over, and away they ilroll'd about the 
Country again ; and I heard one of them fty aloud to 
another; (calling them off from the Boat) Why let her 
GUne^ Jack, can't ye, jhe^U float next Tide ; by which I 
was fully confirm' d in the main Enquiry, of what 
•Countrymen they were ? 

All this while 1 kept my.felf very clofe, not once darl- 
ing to llir out of my Caftle, any farther than to my 
Place of Obfervation, near the Top of the Hill ; and 
very glad I was, to think how well k was fortifyM ^ 
I knew it was no lefs than ten Hours before the Boat 
could be on float again, and by that Time it would be 
dark, and I might be at more Liberty to fee their Mo- 
tions, and to hear their Difcourfe, if they had any. 

In the mean Time I fitted my ielf up for a Battle, as 
before; tho' with more Caution, knowing I had to d© 
with another kind of Enemy than I had at firft : I or- 
der'd Friday alio, whom I had made an excellent Markf- 
man with his Gun, to load himfelfwith Arms: I took 
my (elf two Fowling-Pieces, and I gave him three Mul» 
kets : My Figure, indeed, was very fierce ; I had my 
formidable Goat- skin Coat on, with the great Cap I 
mentioned, a naked Sword, two Piflols in my Belt, and 
a Gun upon each Shoulder. 

It was my Defign, as Ifaidabove, not to have made 
any Attempt 'till it was dark*. But about two aClock, be- 
ing the Heat of the Day, I found that in fhort they were 
all gone ftragglingintotheWoods, and, as I thought were 
all laid down to fleep : The three potJr diftreffed Men, 
too anxious for their Condition to get any Sleep, were, 
however, fet down under the Shelter of a great Tree, at 
about a quarter oi" a Mile from me, and, as I thought, 
x>ut of Sight of any of the reft. 

Upon this I refolv'd to difcover my fclfto them, and 
'learn fomething of their Condition : Immedately I 
march'd in the Figure above, my Man Friday at a good 
Pittance behind me, as formidable for his Arms, as I, 
but not making quite to ftaring a Sj>e&ft*like Figure as 
I did* 



( 244 ) 

•f came as near them undifcoverd as I could, and then 
before any ot them faw me, I calPd aloud to them in 
Spanijh) What are ye Gentlemen? 

They ftarted up at the Nolle, but were ten times 
jmore confounded when they law me, and the uncouth 
figure that I made : They made no Aniwer at all, 
but J! thought I perceiv'd them juft going to ily from 
me, when 1 ipoke to them in Bnglijh : Gentlemen, laid 
I, do not be furprix'd at me ; perhaps you may have 
«a Friend near you, when you did not exped it : He 
inufl be fentdire&ly from Heaven then, (aid one cfthem 
very gravely to me? and pulling (ff bis Hat at t be fame 
Time, ftr our Ccnditicn is paft the Help of Alan. All 
Help is from Heaven, Sir, faid I ; But can you put 
a Stranger in the Way how to help you, for you ieem 
to me, to be in lome great Diurefs ? I faw you when 
you landed, and when you leem'd to make Application 
to the Brutes that came with you, I law one of them 
Hit up his Sword to kill you. 

The poor Man, with Tears running down his Face, 
and trembling, looking like one ailoniih'd, return'd, 
Jim I talking to God y cr Man / h it a real Man> or an 
Angel I Be in no fear about that, Sir, faid /, if God 
had fent an Angel to relieve yea, he would have come 
-better cloth'd, and arm'd after another Manner than 
you fee me in; pray lay afide your Fears, I am a Man, 
an Engl ijh man 9 and difpos'd to aflift you, you fee; I 
have one Servant only ; we have Arms and Ammuni- 
tion; tell us freely, Can we ferve you? — -—What is 
your Cafe? 

Our Cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while 
our Murtherers are ib near; but, in fhort, Sir, I was 
Commander of that Ship, my Men have mutiny'd ,a- 
gainft me, they have been hardly prevail'd on not to 
murther me, and at laffc have fet me on Shore in this 
,defolate Place, with thefe two Men with me, one my 
Mate, the other a PafFenger, where we expe&ed to 
periih, believing the Place to be uninhabited, and know 
not yet what to think of it. 

Where are .thofe Brutes, your Enemies, faid I, Ao 
you know. where they are gone? Tbtre they (pvSir, 
faid he, pointing to a Thicket. of Trees, tnj Kwrt trem» 



( 245 ) ; 

Bks for fear they havefeenus y and beard 'ycufyeab, if ' ihtf 
bave> they will certainly murder us all. 

Have they any Fire. Arms, laid I? He anfwer'd, 
they had only two Pieces, and one which they left in 
the Boat. Well then, laid 1, leave the reft to me ; I 
fee they are all afleep, it' is an eafy thing to kill them 
all j but ihal] we rather take them Prifoners ? He told- 
me there were two defperate Villains among them, that 
it was fcarce late to fliew any Mercy to; but if they 
were fecur'd, he believ'd all the refb would return to ; 
their Duty : I asked him, which they were ? He told, 
me, he could not at that Balance defcribe them r, but 
he would obey my Orders in any thing I would direct: 
Well, fays I, let us retreat out of their View or Hear- 
ing, left they awake, and we will refolve farther \ fo 
they willingly went back with me, till the Woods co- 
ver'd us from them. 

Look you, Sir, laid I, if I venture upon your De- 
liverance, are you willing to make two Conditions with- 
me f he anticipated my Propofals, by telling me, that 
both he and the Ship, it* recover'd, flxould be wholly 
dire&ed and commanded by me in every thing*, and if 
the Ship was not recover'd, he wGuld live and die with, 
me in what Part or* the World fosver I would fend 
him ; and the two other Men faid the fame. 

Welly fays I, my Condzikns are but two* I. That 
while you ftay on this Ifland with me, you will not pre- 
tend to any Authority here; and if I put Arms into* 
your Hands, you will upon all Gceafions give them up 
to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine, upon this 
Ifland, and in the mean time be governed by my 
Orders. 

2. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd, you will 
carry me and my Man to England Paffage-free. 

He gave me all the Ajfurances that the Invention 
and Faith of Man could devife, that he would comply 
with thefe moft realbnable Demands,* and beiides would 
owe his Life to me, and acknowledge it upon all Occa- 
fions as long as he liv'd. 

Well then, faid I, here are three Muskets for you* 

with Powder and Ball; tell me next what you think is 

proper to be done; He ihew'd all the Teftixnony of h# 

M 3 Grati- 



( 2 4 6 > - 

Crratitude that he was able ; bat ofFer'd to be wholly 
guided by me : I told him, 1 thought it was hard ven- 
turing any Thing, but the belt Method I could think 
of, was to lire upon them at once, as they lay ; and if 
any was not kilfd at the firft Volley, and offered to 
iubmit, we might lave them,, and fo put it wholly upon, 
God's Providence to direft the Shot. 

He fiiid very modeftly, That he was loth to kill 
them, if he could help it ; but that thofe two were in- 
corrigible Villains, and had been the Authors of ail the 
"Mutiny in the bhip, and if they efcaped, we fhould be 
undone flill ; for they would go on Board, and bring, 
the whole Ship's Company, and deftroy us all : Well 
then, laid I, NeceJJity legitimates n$ Advice \ for itisth? 
€nlj Way to favs our Lives : However, feeing him ftill 
cautious of {bedding Blood, 1 told hjni they fhould go 
thernfelves, and manage as they found convenient. 

In the Middle of this Difcourfe we heard fome of them 
«wake, and foon after we law two of them on their 
Peet : I ask'd him, if either of them were the Men 
whom he had faid were the Heads of the Mutiny ? He 
i'tiidy Nj : Well then, faid % you may kt them efcape, 
and Providence feems to have waken'd them on Pur- 
pole to fave themfelves: Now, fays l 3 if the reft efcape 
you, it is your Fault* * 

Animated with this, he took tie Musket I had given 
him in his Hand, and a Piftol in his Belt, and his 'two 
Comrades with him, with each Man a Piece in his- 
Hand : The two Men, who were with him going £rft, 
j^iade fome Noife, at which one of the Seamen, who 
was awake, turn'd about, and feeing them coming, 
cry'd out to the reft, but it was too late then, for the 
Moment he cry'd out, they fir'd, / mean the two Men y 
the Captain wifely referving his own Piece : They had 
ib well aim'd their Shot at the Men they knew, that; 
one of them was kilfd on the Spot, and the other very 
much wounded \ but not being dead, he ftarted up 
upon his Feet, and calfd eagerly for Help to the other j- 
but the Captain ftepping to him, told him, 'twas too 
late to cry for Help, he ihould call upon God to forgive 
his Villainy, and with that Word knock'd him down 
mith the Stock of his Musket \ fo that he never fpoke, 

more 



( 2 47 ) 

more : There were three more in the Company, and 
one of them was alio {lightly wounded : By this time I 
was come ; and when they law their Danger* and that 
k was in vain to refill, they begg'd for Mercy: 1 he 
Captain told them, he would fpare their Lives, if they 
would give him any A durance of their Abhorrence of 
the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would fwear 
to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship, and after- 
wards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence 
they came : They gave him all the Protections o* their' 
Sincerity that could be deiir'd, and he was willing to 
believe them, and fpare their Lives, which I was not 
againil ; only I oblig'd him to keep them bound Hand 
and Foot while they were upon the I (land. 
, While this was doing, I lent Friday with the Cap- 
tain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to fecure her, and 
bring, away the Oars and Sail, which, they did. ^ and"* 
by-and-by, three ilraglin^ Men that were ( happily for 
them ) parted from the reft, came back upon hearing 
the Guns nVd, and feeing tht-ir Captain, who before 
was their Prifoner, now their Conqueror, they fub* 
mitted to be bound alfo, andfo our Yi<$ory was com- 
pleat. 

It now remained, that the Captain and I fhould en* 
quire into one another's Cireumftances : I began firft, 
and told him my whole Hiftory, which he heard with 
3n Attention even to Amazement, and particularly at 
the wonderful Manner of my being furnifb/d with Pro* 
vifions and Ammunition; and indeed, as my Story is 
? whole ColJe&ion of Wonders, it afFe&ed him deeply ; 
but when he refie&ed from thence upon himfelf, and 
how I feem'd to have been preferv'd there on purpofe 
to fave his Life, the Tears ran down his Face, and -lis- 
could not fpeak a Word more. 

After this Communication was at an End, T carry'd 
him and his two Men into my Apartment, leading them 
in jufl: where I came out, vi\ . at the Top of the Houfe^ 
where I refrefh'd them with fuch Provifions as I had, 
and fhew'd them all the Contrivances I had made, dur- 
ing ray long, long, inhabiting that Place. 

All I fhew'd them, all I faid to them,, was perfe&l)» 

amazing j but above all, the Captain admir'd my For- 

M 4 tifica- 



(243) - 

tifkation, and how perfe&ly I had conceafd my Re- 
treat with a Grove of Trees, which having been now 
planted near twenty Years, and the Trees growing 
much f after than in England, was become a little Wood, 
and lb thick, that it was unpayable in any Part of it ; 
but at that one Side, where I had reierv'd my little 
•winding PafFage into it: This, I told him, was my Caftle 
2nd my Reiidence ; but that I had a Seat in the Coun- 
try, as moil Princes have, whither I could retreat upon 
Occailon, and I would fhew him that too another Time ; 
bat at preieiifr our Bulinefs was- to confider, how to re- 
cover the Ship : He agreed with me as to that ; but 
told me, he was perfe<5lly at a Lofs what Meafures to 
take > for that there were ftill fix and twenty Hands or* 
Board, who having enter'd into a curfed Confpiracy, 
by which they had all forfeited their Lives to the Law, 
would be hardened in it now by Defperation *, and would 
carry it on, knowing that if "they were reduc'd, they 
ihculd be brought to the Gallows as foon as they came 
to England, or to any of the English Colonies \ and that 
therefore there would be no attacking them with fo 
fin a 11 a Number as we were. 

I mufed for fome time upon what he had faid, and 
found it was a very rational Conclufioa 3 and that 
therefore fomething was to be refolved on very frjeedily, 
as well to draw the Men on Board into fome Snare for 
their Surprize, as to prevent their Landing upon us, 
and deflroving us: Upon this it prefently oecur'd to 
me, that in a little while, the Ship's Crew wondering 
what was become of their Comrades, and of the Boat, 
would certainly come on Shore in their other Boat, to 
iee for them, and that then perhaps they might come 
arm'd, and be too ftrong for us: This he allow'd was 
rational. 

Upon this I told him, the firft Thing we had to do, 
was to ftave the Boat, which lay upon the Beach, fo 
that they might not carry her off ; and taking every 
thing out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs as not to be fit 
to fvvim ; accordingly we went on Board, took the Arms 
which .were left on Board, out of her, and whatever, 
elfe we found there, which was a Bottle of Brandy, and 
another of Rum, a few Bisket Cakes, a Horrj of Pow* 

der a

feys Rcbinfon ; fo he asked the Captain, and the Cap- 
tain himfelf then calls out, You Smithy you know my 
Voice, if you lay down your Arms immediately, and 
fubmit, you fhall have your Lives, all but Will* At~ 
kins. 

Upon this, Will,. Atkins cry'd out, For God's fake, 
Captain, give me Quartet*, What have 1 dene ? They have 
been all as bad as I, which by the Way was not true 
neither ; for it feems this Will. Atkins was the iirft Man 
that laid hold of the Captain, when they firfl mutiny'd, 
and uied him barbaroufly, in tying his Hands, and giv- 
ing him injurious Language : However, the Captain 
toid him he mufl lay down his Arms at Difcretion, 
an^ruft to the Governors Mercy, by which he meant 
me ; for they all call'd me Governour. 

In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and beg? 
ged their Lives j and I lent the Man that had parley'd 
with them, and two more, who bound them all ; and 
then my great Army of 50 Men, which particularly 
with thole three, were all but eight, came up and feiz'd 
upon them all, and upon their Boat, only that I kept 
my (elf and one more out of Sight, for Reafons of State. 

Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and to think 
of fdzing the Ship ; and as^ior the Captain, now he had 
Leifure to parley with them, he ex populated- with them 
upon the Villany of their Practices with him, and at 
length, upon the farther Wickednefs of their Defign ; 
and how certainly it mud bring them to Miiery and 
Diftrefs in the End, and perhaps to the Gallows, 

They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard 
for their Lives : As for that, he told them they were 
none of his Prifoners, but the Commander's of the 
J (land •, that they thought they had fet him on Shore it* 
a barren uninhabited Ifland, but it had pleas'd God fo 
to direft them, that the Iftand was inhabited, and that 
the Governour was an Englijh Man; that he might 
hang them all there, if he pleas'd ; but as he had given 
them all Quarter, he fuppos'd he would fend them to 
England, to be dealt with there, as Juftice required,, ex- 
cept Atkins, who he was commanded by the Governour 
to advife to prepare for Death J for that he would be 
faang'd ia the Morning,. 
; . * Though- 



( *58 ) 

Though this was all a Fi&ion of his own, yeficfctd 
its deiired Eife&; Atkins fell upon his Knees to beg the 
Captain to. intercede with the Governour for his Life, 
and all the reft hegg'd of him for God's fake r that they 
might not be fent to England. 

It now occurr'd to rae^ that the Time of oi*r Deli- 
verance was come, and that it would be a moil: eafy 
Thing to bring tbete Fellow? in, to be hearty in getting 
PofTeffion of the Ship; fo f retired in the Dark from 
them, that they might not fee what Kind of a Gover- 
nour they had, and call'd the Captain to me ; when I 
eall'd, as at a good Diltanee, one of the Men was or- 
4%v' d to fpe^k again, and fay to the Captain, Captain, 
the Commander calls for feu ; and prefently the Cajtein 
reply'd, Tell bis Excellency^ I am ]ufl a coming : x his 
more perfe&ly amus'd them ;. and they all belie v'd, that 
the Commander %vas juft by with his fifty Men. 

Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him my 
Proj^& for Hzing^ the Ship, which he lik'd of wonder- 
fully well, and relblvM to put it in Execution the next 
Morning. 

. But in Order to execute it with more Art, and to be 
fecure of Succefs, I told him we mull: divide the Pri- 
soners, and that he fhould go and tiks Atkias and two 
josore of the worft of them, and fend them pbion'd t& 
the Cave where die others lay : This, was committed to- 
Friday and the two Men who came on Shore with the 
Captain. 

They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Prifon^ 
and it was, indeed, a diimal Place, especially to Men 
m their Condition. 

The other I ordered to my Bower, as I call'd it, of 
which I have given a full Description ; and as it was 
fene'd in, and they pinion' d, the Place was fecure enough,, 
confidering they were upon their Behaviour. 

To theie in the Morning I lent the Captain, who 
was to enter into a Parley with them ; in a Word, to try 
them, and tell me, whether he thought they might 
fee trufted or no, to go on Board and furprixe the §Sp; 
He talk'd to them of the Injury done him, of the Con* 
dirion they were brought to^ and that tho' the Gover- 
nour had given them Quarter for their Lives, as to the 

prefenl 



( *59 ) 

freefent A&ion, yet that if they were fent to England 
they would all be hang'd in Chains, to be fare.;-- bu$ 
that if they would jpin. in fuch an Attempt, as to re* 
cover the Ship, he would have the Governour's En- 
gagement for their Pardon. 

Anyone may guefs how readily fitch a Propofal would 
be accepted by Men in their Condition ; they fell down 
on their Knees to the Captain, and promised with the 
deeped Imprecations, that they would be faithful to 
him to the lafl Drop, and that they fliould owe their 
Lives to him, and would go with, him all over the 
World ; that they would own him- for a Father to them* 
as long as they HVd. 

Well fays the Captain Imuflgo and tell the Gov 
vernour what you fay, and fee what I can do to bring, 
bim to confent to it : So he brought me an Account of 
the Temper he found them in - r and that he verily be- 
lieved they would be faithful. 

However, that we might be very fecure, I told him? 
he ihould go back again, and chuie out five of them, and 
tell them, they fhould fee that he did not want Men ^ 
but he would take out thofe five to be his Affiilants, 
and that the Governour would keep the other two, and 
the three that were fent Prifonert to the CafUe (myCmje^j 
asHoftages, for the Fidelity of thofe five $ and that i£ 
they prov'd unfaithful in the Execution, the five H©£ 
tages fhould be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore., 

Ibis look'd fevere, and eonvinc'd them that the. Go* 
irernour was in Earned however, they had no Way 
kft them but to accept it; and it was now the Bufinefs, 
of the Prifoners > as much as of the Captain, to per- 
fwade the other five to do their Duty. 

Our Strength was now thus order'd for the Expedi^ 
tion. i. The Captain, his Mate> and PafTenger. 2* 
Then the two Prisoner*, of the firfl Gang, to whom* 
having their Char a^ers from the Captain^ I had given. 
their Liberty, and traded them with Arms. 3. The 
©ther two, whom I had kept till now in my Bower 
pinionM, but^ upon the Captain's Motion, bad nov« 
released. 4. Thefe five releas'd at laftj fd that they

Caxe for Hoftages*

with thefe Hands on board the Ship ? For, as for me 
and my Man Friday, I did not think it was proper for 
m to flu*, having feven Men left behind ; and it was 
employment enough for us to keep them afunder, and 
iupply them with Vi&uals. 

r a S l° the £ve in the Cave ^ l re ^v 5 d to keep them 
taife ; but Friday went twice- a Day to them, to fup* 
fly them with Nece/Taries; and I made the other twa 
carry Provisions to a certain Diftance, where Friday 
was to take it. J 

When I fhew'd my felf to the two Hoftages, it was 
with the Captain, who told them, I was the Perfon 
the Governoar had urder'd to look after them, and that 
it was the Governor's Pleafure they fhould not ftir any 
where but by my Dire&ion ; that if they did, they 
fliould be fetch'd into the Caftle, and be laid in Irons ; 
io that as we never luffer'd them to fee me is Gover- 
nour^ fo I now appear'd as another Perfon, and fpoke of 
the Governour, the Garrifon, the Caftle, and the like % 
upon all Occafions. 

The Captain now had no Difficulty before him, but 
tofurmih his two Boats, ftop the Breach of one, and 
Man them; He made his PafTenger Captain of one, 
with four other Men ; and himfelr, and his Mate, and 
fcve more, went in the other: And they contrived their 
^uimefs very well ; for they came up to the Ship about 
Midnight ; As foon as they came within Call of the 
Ship, he made Rvbinfin hale them, and tell them he had 
brought off* the Men and the Boat, but that it was a 
Jong lime before they had round them, and the like: 
holding them in a Chat, till they came to the "Ship's 
Side ; when the Captain and the Mate, entering firft 
W1 j ™ r Arms> immediat ely knock'd down the Se- 
cond Mate a4id Carpenter with the But-end of their 
Muskets, being very faithfully feconded by their Men ; 
they fecur'd all the reft that were upon the Main and 
Quarter-Decks, and began to faften the Hatches. to keep 
them down who were below, when the other Boat and 
their Men entering at the Fore Quins, fecur'd the

^own into -the Cook-Room, making three Men they: 
found there Prifoners. 

When this was done, and all fafe upon Deck, the 
Captain order' d the Mate with three Men to break into 
the Round- Houfe, where the new Rebel Captain lay, 
and, having taken the Alarm, was gotten up, and with 
two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire- Arms in their 
Hands ; and when the Mate with a Crow fplit open 
the Door, the new Captain and his Men iir'd boldly 
among them, and wounded the Mate with a Musket- 
Ball, which broke his Arm, and wounded two more of 
the Men, but kill'd no body. 

The Mate calling for Help, rufh'd however into the 
Round-Houfe, wounded as he was, and with his Fiftol 
ihot the new Captain though the Head, the Bullet en- 
tering at his Mouth, and came out again behind one of 
his Ears; fo that he never fpoke a Word; upon which 
the reft yielded, and the Ship was taken effectually, 
without any more Lives loft. 

As foon as the Ship was thus fecur'd, the Captain or- 
der'd feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the Signal agreed 
upon with me, to give me Notice of his Succefs, which 
you may be fure 1 was very glad to hear, having fat 
watching .upon the Shore for it 5 till near two of the 
Clock in the Morning. 

Having thus heard the Signal plainly, I laid me down; 
and it having been a Day of great Fatigue to me, I llept 
yeiy found, till I was fomething furprfz'd with the 
NoifeofaGun; and prefently ftarting up,^ I heard a 
Man call me by the Name of Governour, Governour, 
and prefently I knew the Captain's Voice, when climb- 
ing up to the Top of the Hill, there he ftood, and point- 
ing to the "Ship, he embrac'd me in his Arms, A4y dear 
Friend and Pelieverer, fays he, there's your Sbty, jorjkc 
isaliy$ur$, and fo are we and all that belong to. her : I 
caft my Eyes to the Ship, and there fhe rode within 
little more than half a Mile of the Shore ; for they had 
weighed her Anchor as foon as they were Mafters of her ; 
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an An- 
chor juft againft the Mouth of the little Creek; and. 
the Tide being up v the Captain had brought the Pin- 
nace 



( l62 ) 

tiace in fiear the Place where I firft landed my Rafts, mi 
£o landed juft at my Door. 

I was at Jirft ready to link dawn with the Surprize : 
IF or I faw my Deliverance indeed vifibly put into my 
Hands, all Things eafy, and a large Ship jufl: ready to 
carry me away whither I pJeafed to go,- At £rft, for 
fome Time, 1 was not able to anfwer him one Word ; 
but as he had taken me in his Arms, I held faft by him, 
or I fliould have fallen to the Ground. 

He perceived the Surprize, and immediately pulls a 
Bottle out of his Pocket, and gave me a Dram of Cor- 
dial, which he had brought on purpofe for me ; alter I 
^drank it, I fat down upon the Ground, and though it 
Brought me to my fell-, jet it was a good while before 
I could fpeak a W ord to him. 

All this while the poor Man was in as great an Extafy 
as I, only not under any Surprize, as 1 was; and he 
faid a thoufand kind tender Things to me, to com pole 
and bring me to my felf ; but fuch was the Flood oi]oy 
in my Breaft, that it put all my Spirirs into Confufionj 
at laft it broke out into Tears, and in a little while after 
1 recovered my Speech. 

Then I took my Turn, and embrac'4 him as my De- 
liverer ; and we rejoycM together : I told him, I looked 
>upon him as a Man fent from Heaven to deliver me, 
and that the whole Tranfa6fcion feem'd to be a Chain of 
Wonders ; that fuch Things as thefe were the Tefli- 
monies we had of a fecret Hand of Providence govern, 
ing the World, and an Evidence, that the Eyes of an 
infinite Power could fearch into the remotefl Corner of 
the World, and iend Help to the Miferable whenever 
iie pleafed. 

I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankfulnefs to 
Heaven ; and what Heart could forbear to blefs him, 
who had not only in a miraculous Manner provided for 
one in fuch a Wildernefe, and in fuch a defolate Condi- 
tion, but from whom every Deliverance mud always be 
acknowledged to proceed ! 

When we had taik'd a while, the Captain told me, 
lie had brought me fome little Refrelhments, fuch as the 
Ship afforded, and fuch as the Wretches who had been fo 
long his Matters had not plunder'dhim of: Upon this 

he 



( **3 ) 

iecall'd aloud to the Boat, and bid his Men bring the 
Things a ihore that were for the Governour ; and in*. 
deed it was a Prefent, as if I had been one, not that was 
to be carry' d along with them, but as if I had beem 
lo dwell upon the I (land ftili, and they were to go with- 
out me." 

Firft he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles full of ex- 
cellent Cordial Waters, fix large Bottles of Madeta Wine ; 
the Bottles held two Quarts a-piece ; two Pound o£ 
excellent good Tobacco, twelve good Pieces of the Ship's 
Beef^ and iix Pieces of Pork, with aBagofPeafe, and 
about a hundred Weight of Bisket. 

He brought me alio a Box of Sugar, a Box of Flow- 
er, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of Lime-juice, 
and abundanceof other Things; But befldes thefe, and 
what was a thouiand times more ufefulto me, he brought 
me fix clean new Shirts, fix very good Neckcloths, 
two Pair of Gloves, one Pair of Shoes,, a Hat, and one 
Pair of Stockings, and a very good Suit of Cloaths of 
his own, which had been worn but very little : In a 
W T ord, he cloathed me from Head to Foot. 

It was a very kind and agreeable P relent, as any one 
^nay imagine, to one in my Circurwftances : But never 
.was any thing in the World of that Kind fo unpleaiant, 
.awkard, and uneafy as it was to me to wear fuch Cloaths 
.at their fir ft putting on. 

A fter theie Ceremonies paft, and after all his good 
Things were brought into my little Apartment, we be- 
gan to confult what was to be done with the Prifoners 
we had ; for it was worth considering, whether we 
anight venture to take them away with us or no, efpe- 
rially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible 
and refa&ory to the lad Degree; and the Captain faid, he 
.knew they were fuch Rogues, that there was no oblig- 
ing them, and if he did carry them away, it mail be in 
Irons, as Malefa&ors, to be deMver'd over to Jufticeat 
£he firft EngUjh Colony he could come at ; and L found 
that the Captain hlmielf was very anxious arjout it. 

Upon this, I told him, that if he defied it, I durft 
^undertake to bring the two Men he fpoke of, to make 
it their own Requeft that he fhould leave them upon th* 
Ifland : 1 jhould be very glad of that 7 fays the Captain, 
wtball my Heart* Well, 



( 2*4 ) 



Well, fays /, I will fend for them up, and talk with 
*hem for you: Sol caus'd Friday and the two Hoilages, 
for they were now difcharg'd, their Comrades having 
.perform'd their Promile •. I lay, i causM them to go to 
-the Cave, and bring up the five Men, pinion'd as they! 
were, to the Bower, and keep them there till I came. 

After fome Time, I came thither drefs'd in my new ; 
Habit, and now I was call'd Go vernour again ; being 1 
all met, and the Captain with me, I caus'd the Men to 
be brought before me, and I told them, I had had a full 
Account of their villainous Behaviour to the Captain^ 
and how they had run away with the Ship, and were 
-preparing to commit farther Robberies, but that Pro. 
vidence had enfnar'd them in their own Ways, and that 
they were fallen into the Pit which they bad digged 
for others. 

I let them know, tbat by my Dire<£Hon the Ship had 
-been feizM, that fhe lay now in the Road, and they might 
fee by-and-by, that their new Captain had received the 
Reward of his Villainy ; for that they might fee him 
hanging at the Yard- Arm. 

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to 
fay, why I fhould not execute them as Pirates taken in 
the Fa&, as by my GommiiHon they could not doubt f 
bad Authority to do* \ 

One of them anfwer'd in the Name ofthereft, Thatl 
fthey had nothing to fay but this, That when they werel 
taken, the Captain promised them their Lives, and they 
humbly implor'd my Mercy : But I told them I knew 
not what Mercy to fhew them ; for, as for my rdf y 1 
hadrefolv'd to quit the Ifland with all my Men, and 
had taken PafTage with the Captain to go for England : 
And as for the Captain, he could not carry them to 
England^ other than as Prifoners in Irons to be try'd for 
Mutiny and running away with the Ship ; the Confe- 
rence of which, they mud needs know, would be the 
Gallows; fo that I could not tell which was beffc for 
them, unlefs they had a Mind to take their Fate in thfe 
Ifland ; if they deiir'd that, I did not care, as I had 
Liberty to leave it, I had fome Inclination to give them 
stheir Lives, if they thought they could fhift on Shore. 

. f ^ : They 



( *6j ) 

They feem'd very thankful for it, -faid they would 
much rather venture to (lay there, than to be carry'd to 
England to be hang'd ; ib 1 left it on that I flue. 

However, the Captain feem'd to make lbme Difficul- 
ty of it, as if he durfe not leave them there : Upon this 
I feerrf d a little angry with the Captain, and told him, 
That they were my A'rifoners not his ; and that feeing 
I had offer'd them ib much Favour, I would be as good 
as my Word ; and that if he did not think fit to content 
to it, I would fet them at Liberty as I found them \ 
and if he did not like that, 4ie might take them again if 
he could catch them. 

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accord- 
]y fet them at Liberty, and bad them retire into the 
Woods, to the Place whence they came, and I would 
leave them feme Fire Arms, -lbme Ammunition, and 
fome Dire&ions how they fhould live very well, if they 
thought iit. 

Upon this, I prepar'd to go on Board the Ship, but 
told the Captain, that I would ftay that Night to pre- 
pare my Things, and deflr'd him to go on Board in the # 
mean Time, and keep all right in the Shi]3, and fend 
the Boat on Shore the next Day for me ; ordering him, 
in the mean time, tocaufe-the new Captain who was 
kilfd, to be hang'd at the Yard- Arm, that thefe Men 
might fee him. 

When the Captain was gone, I fent for the Men up 
to me to my Apartment, and enter'-d ferioufly into Dii^ 
courfe with them of their Circumftances : I told them, 
I thought they had m-ade a right Choice; that if the 
Captain carry'd them away they would certainly be 
hang'd : I fliewed them the new Captain hanging at the 
Yard- Arm of the Ship, and told them they had nothing 
lefs to expe&. 

When they had all deckr'd their willingnefs to ftay, 
I then told them, I would let them into the Story of 
my living there, and put them into the Way of making 
it eafy to them : Accordingly I gave them the whole 
Hiftory of the Place, and of my coming to it ; fliew'd 
-them my Fortifications, the way 1 made my Bread, plant- 
ed my Corn, cured my Grapes ; and in a Word, all that 
was neceffary to make them eafy : I told them the Sto- 

N ry 



( 266 ) 

?ry alfo of the fixteen Spaniards that -were to be expe&ed ; 
for whom I left a Letter, and made them promife to 
.treat them in common with themfeves. 

I kit them my Fire-Arms, vi%. Five Muskets, three 
Fowling-Pieces, and three Swords: I had about a 
Barrel of Powder left ; for after the firft Year or 
two, I ufed but little, and wafted none : I gave them a 
Defcription of the Way I managed the Goats, and Di- 
rections to milk and fatten them, and to make both Bat- 
ter and Cheefe. 

In a Word, I gave them every Part of my own Story ; 
and I told them, I would prevail with the Captain to 
leave them two Barrels of Gun-Powder more, and fome 
Garden- Seeds, which I told them t would have been, 
very glad of; alfb I gave them the Bag of Peafe which 
the Captain had brought me to eat, and bad them be 
lure to low and encreaie them. 

Having done all this, I left them the next Day, and 
iwent on Board the Ship; We prepar'd immediately to 
fail, but did not weigh that Night ; The next Morn- 
ing early, two of the five Men came fwimming to the 
Ship's Side, and making a moil lamentable Complaint of 
the other three, begg'd to be taken into the Ship, for 
God's Sake, for they Ihould be murder'd and begg'd the 
-Captain to take them on Board, tho' he hang'd them 
immediately. 

Upon this, the Captain pretended to rnve no Power 
^without me ; but. after fbme Difficulty, and after their 
iblemn Promifes of Amendment, they were taken on 
Board, and were fame time after foundly whipp'd and 
pickled ; after which they prov'd very honed and quiet 
Fellows. 

Some time after this, I went with the Boat on Shore, 
the Tide being up, with the Things promifed to the 
Men, to which the Captain, at my Interceflion, caus'd 
their Cheifo and Cloaths to be added, which they took, 
and were very thankful for : I alio encourag'd them, 
by telling them, that if it lay in my W 7 ay to fend any 
Veflel to take them in, I would not forget them. 

When I took Leave of this Ifland, I carry'dpn Boari 
for Relkpiesthe great Goat's Skin Cap I had made, my 
Umbrella, and one of my Parrots j alio I forgot no£ 

to 



( **7 ) 



to take the Money I formerly rnenti )n'd, which had Iain 
by me fo long ufelefs, that it was grown rufty, or tar- 
niflVd, and could hardly pals for Silver , till it had been 
a little rubb'd and handl'd ; as alio the Money I found 
in the Wreck of the Spanijh Ship. 

And thus I left the lfland the Nineteenth of Dec?m~ 
Ber> as I found by the Ship's Account, in the Year i6S6, 
after I had been upon it eight and twenty Years, two 
Months, and nineteen Days *, being deliver'd from the 
fecond Captivity the fame Day of the Month that I firfl: 
made my Efcape in the Barco-Longo, from among the 
Mocrs of Salke. 

In this Veilel, after a long Voyage, I arriv'd in Eng- 
land, the Eleventh of June, in the Year 1687, having 
been thirty and five Years abfent. 

When 1 came to England, I was a perfeA Stranger to 
all the World, as if I had never been known there ; 
My Benefa&or and faithful Steward, whom I had left 
in Truft with my Money, was alive, but had had great 
Misfortunes in the W 7 odd, was become a W T idow the 
fecpnd Time, and very low in the World : I made her 
eafy as to what fne ow'd me, alluring her, I would give 
her no Trouble ; but on the contrary, in gratitude t© 
her former Care and Faith fill nefs to me, I reliev'd her 
as my little Stock would afford, which at that Time 
would indeed allow me to do but little for her * 7 but I 
afTur'd her, I would never forget her former Kindnefs to 
me », nor did I forget her, when I had fuflicieat to help 
her ; as fhall be obferv'd in its Place. 

I went down afterwards into Tcrkfihe ; but my Fa- 
ther was dead, and my Mother, and all the Family ex- 
•tinft *, except that I found two Sifters, and two of the 
Children of one of my Brothers *, and as I had been long 
ago given over for dead, there fiad been no Provision 
made for me, io that, in a Word, I found nothing to 
relieve oraflift me ; and that little Money I had, would 
not do fo much for me, as to fettling in the World, 

I met with one Piece of Gratitude indeed, which I 
did not expe& ; and this was, That the Mafter of the 
Ship, whom I had fo happily deliver'd, and by the fame 
Means fav'd the Ship and Cargo, having given a very, 
iandfome Account to the Owners, of the Manner how [ 
- N 2 had 



( 268 ) 

had fiiy'd the Lives of the Men, and the Ship, they in- 
vited me to meet them, and fame other Merchants con- 
cern'd, and all together made me a very handfome 
Complement upon the Subje&, and a Prefent of'almoU 
two hundred Pounds Sterling. 

But after making feveral Refle&ions upon the Cir- 
cumltancts of my Life, and how little V\ ay this wculd 
go towards fettling me in the World, I refolv'd to go to 
JLishcri} and fee it i might not come by fome Informa- 
tion of the State of my plantation in the JBrafils 9 and 
ot what was become of my Partner, who I had Reaion 
to fuppofe had Tome Years now, given me over for dead. 

With this View I took Shipping for Lisbon, where I 
arriv'd in April following ; my Man Friday accompa- 
nying me very honeilly in ail thefeRamblings, and prov- 
ing a moil faithful Servant upon all Occafions. 

When I came to Lisbon^ I ibund out, by Enquiry, and 
to my particular Satisfaction, my old Friend the Cap- 
tain of the Ship, who firft took me up at Sea, offof the 
5hore o\ Jlfricl : He was now grown old, and had left 
cff the Sea, having put his Son, who was far from a 
young Man, into his Ship •, and who (lift ufed the Bfa- 
fil Trade. The old Man did not know me, and, in- 
deed, I hardly knew him ; but I foon brought my felf 
to his Remembrance, when I told him who i was. 

After ibme paflionate Expreifions of our old Acquaint- 
ance, I enquir'-d, you may be fure, after my Plantation 
smd my Partner: The old Man told me, he had not 
been in the BrafiJs for about nine Years; but that he 
could allure me, that when he came away, my Partner 
was living, but the Truftees who I had join'd with him 
to take Cognizance of my Part, were both dead; that 
however, he believ'd that I would have a very good 
Account of the Improvement of the Plantation*, for 
that upon the general Belief of my being cad away and 
drown'd, my Truftees had given in the Account of the 
Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the Procurator 
Fifcal r, who had appropriated it, in Cafe I never came 
to claim it, one Third to the King, and two Thirds to 
the Monaflery of St. Auguftm^ to be expended for the 
Benefit of the Poor, and for the Converfion of the/«* 
Hans to the Catholick Faith ; but that if I appeared, 

or 



( 269 ) 

or any one for me, to claim the Inheritance, it fhould 
be reftor'd ; only that the Improvement, or annual Pro- 
du&ion, being diftrihu ted to charitable U its, could not 
be reftor'd ; but he allured me, that the Steward of 
the King's Revenue (from Lands ) and the Provedore, 
or Steward of the Monaftery, had taken great Care all 
along, that the Incumbent, that is to fay, my Partner, 
gave every Year a faithful Account ot the Produce, of 
which they receiv'd duly my Moiety. 

I ask'd him, If he knew to what Height of Improve- 
ment he had brought the Plantation ? And, whether 
he thought it might be worth looking after ? or whe- 
ther, on my going thither, I fhould meet with no Gb- 
(tru&ion to my pofleffing my juft Right in the Moiety ? 

He told me, he could not tell exa&ly to what De- 
gree the Plantation was improved; but this he knew, 
that my Partner was grown exceeding rich upon the 
enjoying but one Half of it •, and that, to the beft of 
his Remembrance, he had heard, that the Ring's Third 
of my Part, which was, it Items, granted away ta 
fome other Monaftery, or Religious Houfe, amounted 
to above two hundred Moidores a Year ; that as to my 
being reftor'd to a quiet Poffeflion of it, there was no 
Queition to be made of that, my Partner being alive to 
witnefs my Title, and my Name being alio enrolFd in 
the Regifter of the Country : Alio he told me, that the 
Survivors of my two Truftees, were very fair honeft 
People, and very Wealthy"; and he believed I would not 
only have their Afliftance for putting me in PolTeiTion, 
but would find a very confiderable Sum of Money in 
their Hands, for my Account ; being the Produce of 
the Farm, while their Fathers held the Truft, and be- 
fore it was given up, as above, which, as he remerrr- 
ber'd, was for about twelve Years. 

I ihew'd my felf a little concern'd, and uneafy at this 
Account, and enquir'd of the old Captain, how it came 
to pafs, that the Truftees fhould thus difpofe of my 
Effe&s* when he knew that \ bad made my Will, and 
had made him, the Pcrtuguefe Captain, my univerfal 
Heir, CSVi 

He told me, that was true ; but that as there was not 

Proof of my being dead, he cpuld not ad as Executor, 

N 3 until 



( 27° ) 

until ibme certain Account Ihould come of my Death* j 
and that befides, he was not willing to intermeddle 
with a Thing fo remote : That it was true, he had Re- 
giiler'd my Will, and put in his Claim; and could he 
hare given any Account of my being dead or alive, he 
would have a&ed by Procuration, and taken* PofTef- 
iion of the ingenio ( fo they call'd the Sugar-HoufeJ and 
had given his Son, who was now at the Brafils^ Or- 
der to do it. 

But, fays the old Man, I have one piece of News to 
tell you, which, perhaps, may not be fo acceptable to 
you as the reft, and that is, That believing you were 
loilj and all the World believing fo alfo, your Partner 
and Truftees did oifer to accompt to me in your Name, 
for fix or eight of the firft Years of Profits, which I 
receiv'd j but there being at that Time, fays he, great 
Disburfements for increafing the Works, building an 
higeniO) and buying Slaves, it did not amount to near 
ib much as afterwards it produc'd ; However, fays the 
old Man, I fhall give you a true Account of what I 
have receiv'd in all, and how I have difpos'd of it. 

After a few Days farther Conference with this an- 
cient Friend, he brought me an Account of the fix firft; 
Years Income of my Plantation, fign'd by my Partner, 
and the Merchant's Truffees, being always deliver'd in. 
Goods, vi%* Tobacco in Roll, and Sugar in Chefts, he- 
fides Rum, MoloiTes, &'c, which is the Confequence of 
a Sugar- Work; and I found, by this Account, that e- 
very Year the Income confiderably increased : But, as 
above, the Disburfement being large, the Sum at firft 
was frrall : However, the -old.. Man let me fee, that he 
was Debtor to me 470 Moidores of Gold, befides 60 
Cherts of Sugar, and 1 5 double Rolls of Tobacco, which 
were loft in his Ship ; he having been ihip- wrecked 
coming Home to Lisbon^ about 1 1 Years alter my leav- 
ing the Place. 

The good Man then begun to complain of his Mis- 
fortunes, and how he had been oblig'd to make Ufe of 
my Money to recover his LofTes, and buy him a Share 
in a new "Ship: However, my old Friend, fays he, you 
fhall not want a Supply in your Neceflity ; and as Iqoh 
as my Son returns, you fhall be fully fatisfy'd. 

Upon 



( 2 7i ) 

TJpon this. Be pulls out an old Touch, and gives me 
160 Portugal Moidores in Gold; and giving me the 
Writings of his Title to the Ship, which his Son wa$v 
gone to the Braftis in, of which he was a Quarter-Part- 
Owner, and his Son another, he puts them both into 
iuy Hands for Security of the reft. 

I was too much mo'v'd with the Honefty and Rindnefs 
of the* poor Man, to he able to bear this; and remem- 
bring what he had done for me, how he had taken me 
up at Sea, and how generoufly he had uied me on all 
Occaflons ; and, particularly, how fincere a Friend hs 
was now to me, I could hardly refrain weeping, at what 
he faid to rr|e : Therefore, firfl: I ask'd him,, if his Cir- 
eumftances. admitted him to fpare ib much Money at 
•that Time, and if it would not ilraiten him ? He told 
me, he could not fay but it might ilraiten him a lit- 
tle ^ but however, it was my Mony, and I might 
want it more than he. 

Every thing the good Man fa id, was full of AfFec* 
tion, and I could hardly refrain from Tears wiile lie 
fpoke : In fhort, I took icn of the Moidores,and calPci 
for a Pen and Ink to give him a Receipt for them; then 
I return'd h|m the reft, and told him, if ever 1 had 
iPolTeffiort of the Plantation, I would return the other 
to 3iim alio, as indeed ,1 afterwards did ; and that as to 
the Bill of Sale of his Fart in his Son's Ship, I would 
not take it by any Means ; but that it I wanted the Mo- 
rey, I found he was honell enough to pay me ; and if I 
did not, but came to receive what he gave me Real on 
to expe&, I would never have a Fenny more from him. 

When this was pafs'd, the old Man began to ask me, 
if he ffiould put me in a Method to make niy Claim to 
my Plantation ? I told him, I thought to go over to it 
my felf: He faid, I might do fo if I pleased; but that 
if I did not, there were Ways enough to fecure my 
Right, and immediately to appropriate the Profits tp 
my Ufe 5 and as there were Ships in the River of Li$- 
bon, juft ready to go away to Brafil^ he made me enter 
my Name in a publick Regifter, with his Affidavit, af- 
firming upon Oath that I was alive, and that I was the 
fame Per ion who took, up the Land for the Planting the 
feid Plantation at firll. 

N 4 This 



( 2 72 ) 



This being regularly attefled by a Notary, and a Vro-* 
curation affix'd,, he dire&ed me to fend it with a Letter 
of" his Writing, to a Merchant of his Acquaintance at 
the Place, and then propos'd my ilaying with him 'till 
an Account came ot the Return. 

Never any thing was more honourable than the Pro- 
ceedings upon this Procuration ; for in lefs than feven 
Months I received a large Packet from the Survivors of 
my Truflees, the Merchants, for whole Account I went 
to Sea, in which were the following particular Letters 
and Papers enclofed. 

rirft, 1 here was the Account Current of the Produce 
of my Farm, or Plantation, from the Year when their 
Fathers had balanced with my old Portugal Captain, be- 
ing for fix Years ; the Balance appear*d to be 1174 
Moidores in my Favour. 

Secondly, There was the Account of four Years more, 
while they kept the Eftefts in their Hands, before the 
Government claim' d the Adminiftration, as being the 
Efft&s'of a Perfon not to be found, which they call 
■ Civil Death \ and the "Ballar.ce of this, the Value of the 
Plantation encreafing, amounted to Cruiiadoes, 
which made 5241 Moidores. 

Thirdly, There was the Prior of the Augufthih Ac- 
count, who had receiv'd the Profits for above fourteen 
Years j but not being to account/ for what was difpos'd 
to the Hofpital, very honeftly declar'd he had 872 
Moidores not diflributed, which he acknowledged to 
my Account: As ' to the King's Parf a that refunded 
nothing. 

There wasalfb a Letter of my Partner'SjCongratulating 
me very affe&ionately upon my being alive ; giving me 
stn Account how the Eflate was improv'd, and what ic 
produc'd a Year, with a Particular of the Number of 
Squares or Acres that it contained ; how planted, how 
many Slaves there were upon it ; and making two and 
twenty Croites for Blcffings, told me, he had faid fa 
\ many * Ave Maria's to thank the BlefFed Virgin that I 
•was alive \ inviting me very paffionately to come over 
and take Pofleflion of my own, and in the mean time to 
give him Orders to whom he Ihould deliver my Ef- 
feds, if 1 did iiot come myielfj concluding with a 

hearty

( 273 ) 

hearty Tender of his Friendfhip, and that of his Fa** 
mily, and fent me, as a Prefenf, feven fine Leopards 
Skins, which he had, it feems, received from Ajrha, by 
fbiue other Ship which he had fent thither, and who, 
it feems, had made a better Voyage than I : He fent 
me alfo five C hefts of excellent Sweetmeats, and arc- 
Hundred Pieces of Gold uncoin'd, not quite lb large as 
Moidores. 

By the fame Fleet, my two Merchant -Truftees fhipp'd' 
me 1200 C hefts of Sugar, 8co Rolls of Tobacco, and 
the reft of the whole Accompt in Gold. 

I mi'ght.well lay now, indeed, That the latter End of 
Job was better than the Beginning : It is impofliblc to- 
exprefs the Flutterings of my very Heart, when I 
looked over thefe Letters, and efpecially when I found 
all my Wealth about me 5 for as the Brafil Ships come- 
all in- Fleets, the fame Ships which brought my Let- 
ters^ brought my Goods ; and the Effects were fafe ih 
the Tagm before the Letter came to my 'Hand : In a 
Word, I turn'd pale, and grew Tick *, and had not the 
old Man run and fetch y d me a Cordial, I believe the 
fudden Surprize of' Joy had overfet Nature, and t had 
dy'd upon the Spot. 

Nay, after that I continued very ill, and was, fome 
Hours, 'till a Phyfician being fent for, and fome thing, 
of the real Caufe of my Illnefs being known, he order'dL 
me toilet Blood ; After which I had Relief, and grew; 
well;" but I verily believe, if ft had not been tas'd by 
the Vent given in that Manner to the Spirits, Lihoufck 
have dy'd. 

I was now M after, all on a fudden, of above 5 coo/.. 
Sterling in Money, and had an Eftate, as I might well 
call it, tn the Brafils, of above a thoufand Pounds a* 
Year, as lure as an Eftate of Lands in England \ and, in* 
a Word, I was in a Condition which I fcarce knew how- 
to underftand, or how to compofe my felf for the En- 
joyment of. 

The firft Thing I did, was to recompence my original 
Benefactor, my good old Captain, who had been firft 
Charitable to me in my Diftrefs, Kind to me in the Be- 
ginning, and Honeft to me at the End : I fhew'd him. 
all that was fent me } I told him, that next' $0 the: 



( 274 ) 

Providence of Heaven, which difpofes all Things, it 
was owing to him; and that it now lay ,on me to re- 
ward him, which I would do a hundred told: So I 
iiril returned to him the hundred Moidores I had re- 
ceived of him, then I i'ent for a Notary, and cauled 
him to draw up a General Releafe or Difcharge for the 
470 Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd he ow'd me, 
in the fulleft and iirmeft manner poffible ; after which, 
I caus'd a Procuration to be drawn, impowering him to 
"be my Receiver of the Annual Profits of my Plantation, 
and appointing my Partner to Accompt to him, and 
make the Returns by the usual Fleets to him in my 
Name: And a Claufe in the End, being a Grant of 100 
Moidores a Year to him, during his Lire, out of the Ef- 
fects, and 50 Moidores a Year to his Son after hini, fog 
his Life : And thus I requited my old Man. 

I was now to confider which Way to (leer my Ccurfe 
next, and what to do with the Eftate that Providence 
Had thus put into my Hands ; and, indeed, I had more 
Care upon my Head now, than I had in my filent State 
of Life in the Ifland, where I wanted nothing but what 
I had, and had nothing but what t waifted ; whereas I 
had now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs 
was how to iecure it: i had ne'er "a Cave now to hide 
my Money in, or a Place where it might lye without 
Lock or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and tarniih'd before 
any Body would meddle with it: On the contrary t 
knew not where to put it, or who to triift with it ; my 
old Patron, the Captain, indeed was honeft, and that 
was the only Refuge I had. 

In the next Place, my Intered: in the BrafiJs feem'd 
to fummon me thither; but now. I could not tell how 
to t\imk <>f going thither, 'till "I "had fettled my Affairs, 
and left my Effe&s in fome fafe Hands behind me : At 
£rft I thought of my old Friend the Widow, who I 
knew was honed, and would be jufl to me; but then 
Ihe was in Years, and but poor, and, for ought I knew, 
might be in Debt ; fo. that,. in a Word, I had no Way 
but to go back to England my felf, and take my Effe&s 
with me. - 1 

It was fome Months however before I refolv'd upon 
this; and therefore, as l" had rewarded the old Captain 

fall/,

folly, and to'Satisfa&ion, who had been my former Be- 
nera&or, fo I began to think of my poor Widow, whole 
Husband had been my firfl; Beneia&or, and ihe, whie 
it was in her Power, my faithful Steward and Inftru:-. 
tor : So the firft Thing I did, 1 got a Merchant in 
Lisbon to write to his Correfpondent in London^ not only 
to pay a Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in 
Money an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with 
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her, fiie 
fhould, if I liv'd, have a further Supply: At the fame 
time i .fent my two Sifters in the Country, each of them 
an hundred Pounds, they being, tho' not in Want, yet 
not in very good Circumftances ; one having been mar- 
ried, and left a Widow, and the other having a Hu$* 
tand not fo kind to her as he fhould be. 

But among all my Relations or Acquaintances I could 
not yet pitch upon one, to whom I durft commit the 
Grofs of my Stock, that 1 might go away to the- Bra* 
Jils> and leave Thmgs fafe behind me ; and this greatly 
perplexed me, 

I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brafils, and 
have fettled my felf there; for I was, as it were, na- 
turaliz'd to the Place ; but I had iome little Scruple in 
my Mind about Religion, which infenfibly drew me 
back, of which I (hall fay more preiently. However^ 
it was not Religion that kept me from going there for 
the prefent; and as I had made no Scruple of being 
openly of the Religion of the Country, all the while i 
was among them, ib -neither did I yet; only that now 
and then having of late thought more of it, ( than for- 
merly ) when I began to think of living and dying a- 
mong them, I began to regret my having profeis'd my 
felf a Papiit, and thought it might not be the beft Re- 
ligion to die with. 

. But, as I have faid, this was not the main Thing that * 
kept me from going -to the Brafils ; but that really I did 
not know with whom to leave my EfFeits behind me; 
io I refolv'd a&laft to go to England with it, where, if 
I arriv'd, I concluded i fhould make fome Acquaint- 
ance, or find fome Relations that would be faithful to 
me ; and accordingly I prepard to go, for England with 
all my Wealth. 

I* 



( 2 7* ) 

In order to prepare Things for my going Home, f 
firft ( the Bra/il Fleet being jud going away J refolv'd 
to give Anfwers iuitable to the juft and faithful Ac- 
count of Things I had from thence; and £rft to the 
Prior of St. Augufiine I wrote a Letter lull of Thanks 
for their juft Dealings, and the Offer of the 872 Moi- 
dores, which was. undifpofed off, which I defir'd might 
be given, 500 to the Monafterv, and 372 to the Poor,. 
as the Prior lhould direA, dlefiring the good Padres 
Prayers for me, and the like. 

I wrote next a Letter of thanks to my two Truftees, 
with all the Acknowledgment that fomuch Juftice and 
Honefty calpd for ; as tor fending them any Prefent, 
they were far above having any Occafion of it. 

jLaflljiy I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging his Irr- 
duilry in the Improving the Plantation, and his Integri- 
ty in encreafing the Stock of the Works, giving him in- 
uru&ions lor his future Government of my Part, ac- 
cording to the Powers I had left with my old Patron, to- 
whom I defired him to fend whatever became due to 
me* 'till he fhould hear from me more particularly ; al- 
luring him, that it was my Intension, not only to come 
to him, but to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of 
jmy Life : To this I added a, very handfome Pre fen t of 
feme Italian Silks for his Wife and two Daughters- for 
fuch the Captain's Son informed me he had ; with two 
Pieces ©f fine EngUjb Broad-Cloath, the beft I could get 
in Lisbon, five Pieces of black Bays,, and fome Flanders 
I^aeeofagood Value. 

Having thus fettled my AfHirs, fold my Cargo, and 
turn'dall my Effeds into good Bills of Exchange, my 
Tiext Difficulty wa% which. Way to go to England; t 
had been accuftom'd enough to the Sea, and yet I had a 
ftfange Averfion to go to England by Sea at that Time ;, 
and though I could give no Reafcn for it, yet the Dif- 
ficulty encreas'd itpon me io much, that though I had 
©isce fhippM my Baggage in order to go, yet 1 altered 
my Mind, and that not once, but two #r three times. 

It is true, I had' been very un lor tuna te by Sea, and 
this might be fome of the Reafons : But let no Man 
flight the . (Iro ng Impulfesof hU own Thoughts in Ca*

gled out to go in, I mean, more particularly fingled out 
than any other, that is to lay, Co as in one of them to 
'put my Things on Board, and in the other to have a- 
greed with the Captain yl fay, two of thefe Ships mif- 
carry'd, vl\. one was taken by the Algerines, and the 
other was caft away on the Start near Tor bay, and all 
the People drown'd except three ; fo that in either of 
thole VefTels i had been made miferable, and in which 
moil, it was hard to fay. 

Having been thus harrafVd in my Thoughts, my old 
Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing, prefs'd 
itie earneftly not to go by Sea ; hut either to go by 
Land to the Gr&ym, and crofs over the Bay of Bafcay to 
Roc/jell, from whence it was but an eafy and fafe Jour- 
ney by Land to Vans, and fo to Calais and .Dover ; or 
to go up to Madrid) and Co all the Way by Land through 
France, 

In a Word, I was Co prepofTeis'd againfl my going by 
Sea at all, except from Calais to D^ver, that I refolv'd 
to travel all the Way by Land ; which, as I was not in 
Halle, and did not value the Charge, was by much the 
pleafanterWay ;and to make it more fo, my old Captain 
brought an Engliib Gentleman, the Son of' a Merchant 
in Lisbon^ who was willing to Travel with me ; After 
which, we pick'd up two who were Englijh and Mer- 
chants alfo, and two young Portuguefe Gentleman, the lafl 
going to Paris only ; fo that we were in all fix oTus, and 
£ve Servants ; the two Merchants^ and the two Porta- 
guefe contenting themfelves with one Servant between 
two, to lave the Charge ; and as for me, I got an Eng- 
lish Sailor to travel with me as a Servant, befides my 
Man Friday, who was too much a Stranger, to be capa- 
ble of fupplyingthe Place of a Servant upon the Road. 

In this Manner I fet out from Lisbon : And our Com- 
pany being all very well mounted and arrn'd, we made a 
little Troop, whereof they did me the Honour to call 
me Captain, as well becaufe I was the oldeft Man, as> 
becaufe I had two Servants, and, indeed, was the Ori- 
ginal of the whole Journey,

Journal: But fo»!,e Adventures that happened to ^s in. 
this tedious and difficult Journey, I mult not omit. 

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us Strangers 
to Spuiriy were willing, to ftay fome Tims to fee the 
Court of Spam, and to fee what was worth obferving; 
but it being the latter Part of the Summer, we haften'd 
away, and let out from Madrid about the Middle of 
October: But when we came to the Edge of Navarre ^ we 
Were alarm' d at feveral Towns on the Wa^, with an 
Account, that fo much Snow was fallen on the Frenc h 
Side of the Mountains, that feveral Travellers were o* 
blig'd to tome back to Pampekna y after having attempt 
ted at an extreme Hazard, to pafs on. 

When we came to P amp el una it fel£ we found it fo 
indeed; and to me that had been always ufed to a hot 
Climate, and indeed to Countries where we could icarce 
bear any Cloaths on, the Cold was unfufferable ; nor, 
indeed, was it more painful than it was fur prizing, to 
come but ten Days before out of the Old Cujiile, where 
the Weather was not only warm, but very hot ; and 
immediately to feel a Wind from -the. Vyrenman Moun- 
tains, ib very keen, fo feverely cold, as to be intolerable, 
and to endanger benumming and perifhing of our din- 
gers and Toes was very ilrange. 

YooxYriday was really frighted when he faw the Moun- 
tains all cover'd with Snow, and felt coldWeather, which 
he had never feen or felt before in his Life. 

To mend the Matter, after we came to Tawpeluna, 
it continued Snowing with fo much Violence, and fo 
long, that the People iaid, Winter was come before its 
Time, and the Roads, which were difficult before, were 
now quite impafTable ; in a Word, the Snow lay in 
Tome Places too thick for us to Travel ; and being not 
bard frozen as is the Cale in Northern Countries, there 
was no going -without being in Danger of being bury'd 
£live every Step : W T e (laid no leis than twenty Days 
ktTampelum\ when (feeing- the Winter coming on, and 
ho likelyhood of its being better, for it was the fevereft 
Winter all over Europe that had been known in many 
Years) I propofed that we ihould all go away to FeUc 
%ahia, and there take Shipping for Bourdeaux, which 
tyas a very little Voyage. 

But 



(a 79 ) 

Bat while we were confidering this, there came in 
four French Gentlemen, who having been flopped on the 
French iide of th3 Paifes, as we were on the Spamjh, .had 
found out a Guide, who traverfing the Country near the 
Head ot Languedtc, had brought them over the Moun- 
tains by fuch Ways, that they were not much incom- 
moded with the Snow ; and where they met with Snow 
in any Quantity, they faid it was frozen hard enough 
to bear them and theirHorles. 

We lent for this Guide, who told us, he would under- 
take to carry us the fame Way, with no Hazard from 
the Snow, provided we were artrfd fufficiently to pro- 
ted us from wild Beads } for, he laid, upon thefe great 
Snows, it was frequent for lome Wolves to fhow them- 
felves at the Foot of the Mountains, being made raven- 
ous for want of Food, the Ground being cjver'd with 
Snow : We told him we were well enough prepared for 
fuch Creatures as they were, if* he would erfure us 
from a Kind of two legged Wolves, which we were told 
we were in moft Danger from, efpecially on the French 
Side of the Mountains. 

He fatisfy'd us there was no Danger of that Kind in 
the W T ay that we were to go : So we readily agreed to 
follow him, as did alfo twelve other Gentlemen, with 
their Servants, fome French, fome Spamfo, who, as I 
faid, had attempted to go, and were oblig'd to come 
biick again. 

1 Accordingly we all {Qt out for Patnpejuna, with our 
Giiide, on the fifteenth of November ; and indeed, I 
wa£ fur prized, when inftead of going forward, he came 
directly bask with us, on the fame Road that we came 
from Madrid, ab*6ve twenty Miles ; when being pafs'd 
two Rivers, and come into the plain Country, weiound 
©urfelves in a warm Climate again, where the Country 
was pleafant, and no Snow to be feen ; but on a fudden, 
turning to the Left, he approach'd the Mountains ano- 
ther Way ; and tho 5 it is true, the Hills and Precipices 
look'd dreadful, yet he made fo many Tours, fuch Mean- 
ders, and led us by fuch winding Ways, we wereinfen* 
fibly pafs'd the Height of the Mountains, without being 
much incutnber'd with the Snow ; and all on a fudden 
he fliew'd us the gkafant fruitful Provinces of L<wgw~

they were at a great Diftance, and we had Tome rough 
W ay to pafs yet. 

We were a little uneafy however, when we found it 
fnow'd one whole Day, and at Night, fo fail, that we 
could not travel ; hut he bids us be eaiy, we fhould loon 
be paft it all : We found, indeed, that we began to de- 
fcend every Day, and to come more North than before^ 
and {o depending upon our Guide, we went on. 

It was about two Hours before Night, when our 
Guide being fomething before us, and not jufl in Sight, 
out rulh*d three monilrous Wolves, and after them a 
Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoining to a thick Wood"; 
two of the Wolves ilew upon the Guide, and had he 
been half a Mile before us, he had been devour'd indeed, 
before we could have help'd him : One of them faflen'ft 
upon his Horfe, and the other attacked, the Man with 
that Violence, that he had not Time, or not Pre fence of 
Mind enough to draw his Piftol, but hollowed and cry'd 
out to us moil luftily *, my Man Friday being next to me, 
I bid him ride up, and fee what was the Matter: As 
foon as Friday came in Sight of the Man, he hollow'd as 
loud as t'other, Mafter I O Mafler I But like a bold 
Fellow, rode direftly up to the poor Man, and with his 
Piftol ihot the Wolf that attacked him into the Head. 

It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my Man 
Friday ; for he having been uied to that kind of Creature 
in his Country, had no Fear upon him ; but went clofe 
up to him, and Ihot him, as above ; whereas any of us 
would have hYd at a farther Diftance, and have per- 
haps either mifs'd the Wolf* or endangered ihooting the 
Man. 

But it was enough to have terrify'd a bolder Man than 
I, and indeed it alarm'd all our Company, when with, 
theNoife of JFW^'sPiitol, we heard en both Sides the 
"diimalleft howling of Wolves, and the Noife redoubled 
by the Eccho of the Mountains, that it was to us as if 
there had been a prodigious Multitude of them ; and 
•perhaps indeed, there was not fuch a few, as that we had 
no Caufe of Apprehenfions. 

However, as Friday had killed this Wol£ the other, 
that had faflen'd upon the Horfe left him immediately 

and 



( *8r ). 

£nd fled, having happily fatten' d upon his Head, where 
the Boffes of the Bridle had ftuck in his Teeth, fo that 
he had not done him much Hurt: The Man, indeed^ 
was motl hurt ; for the raging Creature had bit him 
twice, once on the Arm, and the other Time a little a- 
bove his Knee *, and he was jull as it were tumbling 
down by the Diforder oftheHorfe, when Friday came 
up and ihot the Wolf. 

It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the Noifc of Fridaf$¥i£- 
tol, we all mended our Pace, and rid up as fair, as the 
Way (which was very difficult) would give us Leave} 
to fee what was the Matter \ as foon as we came cleat 
of the Trees, which blinded us before, we fiw plainly 
what had been the Caie, and how Friday had difengaged 
the poor Guide ; though we did. not presently difeern 
what Kind of Creature it was he had killed. 

But never was a Fight manag'd fo hardily, and in fuch 
a furprizing Manner, as that which fbllow'd between 
Friday and the Bear, which gave us all (though at £ril 
we were fur priz ? d and afraid for hinfKthe greateft Di- 
veriion imaginable : As the Bear is a heavy, clumfey 
Creature, and does not gallop as the Wolf does, who is 
fwift and light ;fo he has two particular Qualities, which 
generally are the Rule of his A&ions ; FtrJ}> As to Men, 
who are not his proper Prey, I fay, not his proper Prey, 
becaufe, tho' I can't fay what excefftve hunger might do, 
which was now their Cafe, the Ground being all co- 
ver'd with Snow ; yet as to Men, he does not ufually 
attempt them upleis they firfl: attack him : On the con- 
trary ,if you meet him in theWoods,tho 5 if you don't med- 
dle with him, he won't meddle with you ; yet then you 
muft take care to be very civil to him, and give him the 
Road, for he is a very nice Gentleman, he won't go a 
ftep out of the Way for a Prince \ nay, if you are really 
afraid, your beft way is to look another Way, and keep 
going on ; for fometimes, if you ftop, and ftand flilt 
and look fledfaftly at him, he takes it for an Affront; 
but if you throw or to is any thing at him, and it hits 
him, though it were but a Bit ot Stick as big as your 
linger, he takes it for an Affront, and fetsall his other 
Bufi.nefs afide to purfue his Revenge, for he will have 
Satisfaction ia Point of Honour, that is his firft Qua- 
lity; 



( 282 ) 

The next is. That if he be once affronted, he will never 
leave you, Night or Day, till he has his Revenge, hut 
follow, at a good round Rate, till he overtakes you. 

My Man Friday had deliver'd our Guide, and when 
we came up to him, he was helping him off from his 
Hone, for the Man was both hurt and frighted, and in* 
deed the lad more than thefirft; when 'on the fudden, 
we fpy'd the Bear come out of the Wood, and a vail 
monftrous one it was, the biggeft by farjthat ever I faw : 
We were all a little furprized when we faw him, but 
when Friday faw him, it was eafyjto fee Joy and Courage 
in the Fellow's Countenance : 6 ! O! ) fays Friday, 
three Times pointing to him, Mafler ! %u give me 
te Leave, me Jhakee tt Hand with him, me make? yea 
good Laugh* 

I was iurprix'd to fee the Fellow fa pleas' d ; l ! ou Fool 
you, fays I, he will eat you up: Eatee me up! Eatee me 
up ! fays Friday, twice over again *, Me eatee him up : 
Me make you good Laugh : 7bu all ft ay here, me jkowycu 
good Laugh : So down he fits* and gets his Boots off in 
a Moment, and put on a Pair of Pumps, (as we call the 
flat Shoes they wear J and which he had in his Pocket, 
gives my other Servant his'Horfe, and, with his Gup, 
away he flew, fwift like the Wind. 

The Bear was walking foftly on, and ofFer'd to meet- 
die with no Body, till hriday coming pretty near, calls- 
to him, as if the Bear could underftand him, Harlye, 
hark ye, fays Friday, me jpeakee wit you : We follow' d at 
a pittance ; for now being come down on the Gaf coign 
Side of the Mountains*, we were enter'd a vatt great 
Forett, where the Country was plain, and pretty open, 
tho 5 many Trees in it fcatter'd here and there. 

Friday, who had, as we fay, the Heels of the Bear, 
came up wifh Mm quickly, and takes up a great Stone 
and throws at him, and hit him juft on the Head ; but 
did him no more Harm, than if ke had thrown it againtt 
a Wall \ but it anfwer'd Friday's End \ for the Rogu£ 
was fb void of Fear, that he did it purely to make 
the Bear follow him, and ihow us fome Laugh, as he 
fcalPd it. 

* As foon as the Bear felt the Stone, and faw him; he 
turns about, and comes after him, taking, deviiiih long 

Strides, 



Stride?, and ihuffiing along at a flrange Rate, fo as would 
put a Horfe to a middling Gallop ; away runs Friday, 
and takes his Courfe, as ir he run towards us for Help ; 
fo we all refolv'd to fire at once upon the Bear, and de- 
liver my Man ^ tho' I was angry at him heartily for 
bringing the Bear hack upon us, when he was going a- 
bout his own Buflneis another Wayv and efpecially I 
was angry that he had turned the Bear upon us, and 
then run away ; and I calFd out Tou D g, faid I, is this 
ycur moling us laugh ? Come avoay^ and take pur Horfe^ 
that we may jhcct the Creature \ he hears me, and cries 
out, Nojhoct, nojhootyftandflill,jcuget much Laugh: 
And as. the nimble Creature run two Foot for the Beaft's 
one, he turn'd on a Ridden, on one Side of us, and fee- 
ing a great Oak- Tree, fit for his Purpofe, he beckon'd 
us to follow, and doubling his Pace, he gets nimbly up 
the Tree, laying his Gun down upon the Ground, at 
about five or fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.' 

The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we follow'd at 
a Diiiance ; the fir ft Thing he did, -he ftopp'd at the 
Gun, fmelt to it, but let it lie, and up he fcrambles irf-, 
to the Tree, climbing like a Cat, thV fo monfbroufl^ 
Heavy : I was amax'd at the Folly, as I thought it, of 
my Man, and could .not for my Life fee any Thing to 
kugh at yct 9 tilHeeiiig the Bear get up the Tree, we all 
rode nearer to him. 

When wc came to the Tree, there was Friday got but 
to the fmall of a large Limb of the Tree, and the Bear 
got about half Way to him ; as foon as the Bear got out 
to that Part where the Limb of the Tree was weaker, 
Ha, fa j 5 he to us, new you fee me teachee the Bear dance } 
fo he falls a jumping and fhaking the Bough, at which 
the Bear began to totter, but ftood ftill, and began to 
look behind him, to fee how he fhould get back ; then 
indeed we did laugh heartily : But Friday had not done 
with him by a great deal; when he fees him ftand ftill, 
he calls out to him again, as if he had fuppos'd the Bear " 
could fpeak Englijb ; WlMt y you no come farther ? Pray 
youccme farther) fo he left jumping ana fhaking the 
Bough ; and the Bear, ju(t as if he had underftood what 
he faid, did come a little farther, then he fell a- jumping 
again, and the Bear iiopp'd again. 

We 



( *8 4 ) 

We thought now was a good Time to knock him on 
the Head, and called to Friday to (land dill, and we 
would Ihoot the Bear \ but he cry'd out earneftly, O 
fray I Q pray! no jboct, me fooot by and then\ he would 
have faid, by-and-by. However, to ihorten the Story, 
Friday danc'd fo much, and the Bear flood lb tickliih, 
that we had laughing enough indeed, but flill could not 
imagine what the Fellow would do ; for firft we thought 
he depended upon fhaking the Bear off; and we found 
the Bear was too cunning for that too \ for he would 
not go out far enough to be thrown down, but clings 
faft with his great broad Claws and Feet, fo that we 
could not imagine what would be the End of it, and 
where the Jeft would be at laft. 

But Friday put us out of Doubt quickly ; for feeing 
the Bear cling fad to the Bough, and that he would not 
be perfwaded to come any farther; Well, well, faid Fri- 
day, ycu no come farther, me go, me go ; you no come t$ 
me, me come toy>u ; and upon this, he goes out to the 
fmallefl End of the Bough, where it would bend with 
his Weight, and gently lets himfelf down by it, Aiding 
down the Bough, till he came near enough to jump 
diown on his Feet, and away he run to his Gun, takes it 
up, and {lands (kill. 

Well, faid I to him, Friday, What will you do now? 
Why don't you fhoot him ? Nojboot, fays Friday, noyet, 
me fioot new, me no kill$ me flay, give you one m:re 
Laugh : And indeed fo he did, as you will fee prefent- 
ly; for when the Bear fee his Enemy gone, he comes 
back from the Bough where he flood ; but did it mighty 
leifurely, looking behind him every Step, and coming 
backward till he got into the Body of theTree : Then 
,with the fame hinder-End foremofl, he came down the 
Tree, grafping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot 
at a Time, very leifurely; at this Juncture, and juft 
before he could fet his hind- Feet upon the Ground, 
Friday ftepp'd clofe to him* clapp'd the Muriel of his 
Piece into his Ear, and fhot him dead as a Stone. 

Then the Rogue turn'd about, to fee if we did not 

laugh, and when he faw we were pleas' d by our Looks, 

.he falls a-laughing himfelf very loud ; So we kill Bea* 

"to my Country 9 fays Friday j fo you kill them, fays f, 

% why 



■ups^l 



( 2 8 5 ) 

why you have no Guns : No y fays he, m Gun^ but jboot 
great much long Arrow* 

This was, indeed, a good Diverfion to us; but we 
were ftill in a wild Place, and our Guide very much 
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew ; the Howling 
of Wolves run much in my Head *, and indeed, except 
theNoife I once heard on the Shore of Africa^ of which 
I have faid fomething already, I never heard any thing 
that fill'd me with fo much Horror. 

Thefe things, and the Approach of Night, called us 
off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us, we Ihould 
certainly have taken the Skin of this monftrous Crea- 
ture off, which was worth faving \ but we had three 
Leagues to go, and our Guide haften'd us, fo we left 
him and went forward on our Journey. 

The Ground was ftill cover'd with Snow, tho* not 
fo deep and dangerous as on the Mountains, and the 
ravenous Creatures, as we heard afterwards, were come 
down into the Foreft and plain Country, prefs'd by 
Hunger to feek for Food ; and had done a great deal of 
Miichief in the Villages, where they furpm*d the Coun- - 
try-People, kili'd a great many of their Sheep and 
Horfes, and fome People too. 

We had one dangerous Place to pals, which our 
Guide told us, if there were any more Wolves in the 
Country, we Ihould find them there \ and this was a 
fmall Plain, furrounded with Woods on every Side, 
and a long narrow Defile or feane, which we were to 
pal's to get through the Wood, and then we ihould come 
to the Village where we were to lodge. 

It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we en- 
ter'd the firft Wood ; and a little after Sun-fet, when 
we came into the Plain, we met with nothing in the 
firft Wood, except that in a little Plain within the 
Wood, which was not above two Furlongs over, we 
faw five great Wolves crols the Road, full Speed on£ 
after another, as if they had been in Chafe of fome 
Prey, and had it in View, they took no Notice of us, 
and were gone, and out of our Sight in a few Moments. 
Upon -chis our Guide, who by the Way was a 
wretched faint-hearted Fellow* bid 'as keep in a ready 

Pofturej 



( a86.) 

N Ipofture } for he believ'd there were more Wolves a 
coming. 

We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us, 
but we law rio more Wolves, 'till we came thro' that 
Wood, which was near half a League, and enter'd the 
Plain ; as Toon as we came into the Plain, we had Oc- 
cafion enough to look about us ; the firft Objed we met 
with, was a dead Horfe ; that is to fay, a poor Horfe, 
which the Wolves had kilfd, and at leaf! a Dozen of 
them at Work ; we could not fay eating of him, but 
picking of his Bones rather ; for they had eaten up all 
the Fleih before. 

We did not think fit to difturb them at their Feaft, 
neither did they take much Notice or us : Friday would 
have let fly at them, but I would not fufFer him by 
any Means; for I found we were like to have more Bu- 
ilnefs upon our Hands than we were aware of. We 
were not gone half over the Plain, but we began to 
hear the Wolves houl in the Wood on our Left, in a 
frightful Manner ; and prefently after we law about a 
hundred coming on dire&ly towards us, all in a Body, 
and moft of them in a Line, as regularly as an Army 
drawn up by experienc'd Officers : I fcarce knew m 
what Manner to receive them ; but found to draw our- 
selves in a clofe Line, was the only way : So we formed 
in a Moment : But that we might not have too much 
Interval, I order'd, that only every other Man fhould 
Jjre, and that the others who had not fir'd, would (land 
ready to give them a fecond Volley immediately, if 
they continued to advance upon us, and that then thofe 
*who had fir'd at firft, ihould not pretend to load their 
Fuzees again, but ftand ready with every one a Piftol, 
for we were all arm'd with a Fuzee, and a Pair of Pi- 
flols each Man ; fo we were by this Method able to fire 
fix .Volleys, half of us at a time; however, at prefent 
•we had no Neceflity, for upon firing the firft: Volley, 
the Enemy made a full Stop, being terrified as well 
with theNoife, as with the Fire ; four of them being 
4hot into the Head, dropp'd ; federal others were wound- 
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by the Snow: 
I found they ftopp'd, but did not immediately retreat ; 
♦whereupon -reuiemhring -that I had been told, that the 

fierceft 



( *8 7 ) 

fierceft Creatures were terrify'd at the Voice of a Manv 
I caus'd atl our Company to hollow as loud as we could ^ 
and I found the Notion not altogether miftaken, for 
upon our Shout, they began to retire, and turn about ; 
then I order'd a fecond Volley to be iir'a, in their Rear, 
which put them to the Gallop, and away they went to* 
'the Woods. 

This gave us leifure to charge our Pieces again, and 
that we might loie no Time, we kept going 5 but we 
had but little more than loaded our Fuzees, and put 
our ferves into a Readinefs, when we heard a terrible 
Nolle in the fame Wood, on our Left, only that it was 
farther onward the fame Way we were to go. 

The Night was coming on, and the Light began to 
be dusky, which made it the worfe on cur Side •, but the 
Noife encreafing, we could eafily perceive that it was 
the howling and yelling of thofe hellifh Creatures 5 and 
on a fudden, we perceiv'd two or three Troops of 
Wolves, one on our left, orie behind us, and one on cur 
Front \ fo that we feem'd to be furrounded with them ; 
however, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our 
W T ay forward, as fail: as we could make our Horfes go, 
which the Way being very rough, was only a good 
large Trot j and in this manner we came in View of 
the Entrance of a Wood, thro' which we were to pais, 
at the Farther Side of the Plain \ but we were greatly 
furpriz'd, when coming near the Lane, or Pals, we law 
a oonfus'd Number of Wolves Handing juft at the En- 
trance. 

On a fiidden, at another opening of the Wood, vre 
heard the Noife of a Gun ; and looking that Way, out- 
rufrfd a Horfe, with a Saddle, and a Bridle on him, 
jflying like the Wind, and fixteen or feventeen W T olves 
after him, full Speed \ indeed, the Horfe had the Heels 
of them ; but as we fuppos'd that he could not hold it 
at that rate, we doubted not but they would get up 
with him at laft, and no queftion but they did. 

Here we had a moll horrible Sight ; for riding, up 
to the Entrance where the Horfe came out, we found 
the Carcafs of another Horfe, and of two Men,; de- 
vour'd by the ravenous Creatures, and one of the Men 
was uo doubt th§ fiuwe.who we heard .fire, the; Guru for. 

there 



( 288 ) 

there lay a Gun jufl: by him fir'd ofF; but as to the Man, 
his Head, and the upper Part of his Body, was eaten up. 

This fill'd us with Horror, and we knew not what 
Courie to take, but the Creatures refolv'd us foon; 
for they gather'd aboutus prefently, in hopes of Prey; 
and I verily believe there were three hundred of them: 
It happened very much to our Advantage, that at the 
Entrance into the Wood, but a little Way from it, 
there lay fome large Timber Trees, which had been 
cut down the Summer before, and 1 fuppofe, lay there 
for Carriage : I drew my little Troop in among thofe 
Tcees, and placing our felves in a Line, behind one long 
Tree, I advis'd them all to Light, and keeping that 
Tree before us, for a Bread-Work, to ftand in a Tri- 
angle, or three Fronts, encloflng our Horfes in the 
Center. 

We did fo, and it was well we did ; for never was a 
more furious Charge than the Creatures made upon us 
in this Place ; they came on us with a growling kind of 
aNoifeand mounted the Piece of Timber, (which as I 
faid, was our Break-Work, as if they were only ruihing 
upon their Prey ; and this Fury of theirs, it feems, was 
principally occafion'd by their feeing our Horfes behind 
us, which was the Prey they aimed at : I ordered our 
Men to fire as before, every other Man; and they took 
their Aim fo fure, that indeed they kill'd feveral of the 
Wolves at the firft Volley; but there was a Neceifity to 
keep a continual Firing \ for they came on like Devils, 
thofe behind, pufhtng on thofe before. 

When we had fir'd our fecond Volley of our Fuzees, 
we thought they flopped a little, and I hop'd they 
would have gone off, but it was but a Moment, * for 
others came forward again ; fo we fir'd two Volleys of 
our Piftols, and I believe in thefe four Firings, we kil- 
led feventeen or eighteen of them, and lam'd twice as 
many ; yet they came on again. 

I was loath to fpend our laft Shot too haflily ; fo I cal- 
led my Servant, not my Man Friday, for he was better 
einpioy'd; for with the greateft Dexterity imaginable, 
he had charg'd my Fuxee/ and his own, while we were 
engaged, liut as I faid, I (fallM my other Man, and giv- 
ing him a Horn of Powder, I bad him lay a Train, all 

along 



( *8P ) 

along $he piece of Timber, and let it be a large Train ; 
he did fo 9 and had but jtift Time to get away, when the 
Wolves came up to it, and fome were got up upon it; 
when I fnapping an uncbarg'd Pidol, clofe to the Pow- 
der, let it on tire ; thole that were upon the Timber 
were fcorch'd with it, and fix or feven of them fell, or 
rather jump'd in among us, with the Force and Fright 
of the Fire, we difpatch'd thefe in an Inftant, and the 
reft were fo frighted with the Light, which the Night, 
for it was now very near dark, made more terrible, that' 
they drew back a little. 

. Upon which I order'd our laft Piftols to be £r'd off 
in one Volley, and after that we gave a Shout ; upon 
this, the Wolves turn'd Tail, and we fally'd immediate- 
ly upon near twenty lame Ones, who we found drug- 
ling on the Ground, and fell a cutting them with our 1 
Swords, which anfwer'd our Expe&ation ; for the Cry- 
ing and Howling they made was better underdood by 
their Fellows, fo that they all fled and left us, 

Wehadj firft and laft, kill'd about threefcore of them ; 
and had it been Day-light, we had kill'd many more : 
The Field of Battle being thus cleared, we made for- 
ward again ; for we had dill near a League to go ; We 
heard the ravenous Creatures howl and yell in the Woods 
as' we went, feveral times ) and fometimes we fancy'd- 
we &w t Come of them, but the Snow dazling our Eyes, 
we were not certain * fo in about an Hour more, we 
came; to,the Town, where we were to lodge, which we 
found in a terrible Fright ; and all in Arms ; for it feems, 
that the Night before, the Wolves and fome Bears had 
broke jnco that Village, and put them in a terrible 
*?»£*£ \ * n A thejwete obliged to keep Guard Night and 
Day, but especially in the Night, to preierve their Cat- 
tle*, a,nd indeed their People. •■ . 
^The ne*t Morning our Guide was fo ill, and his 
Limbs fo fweil'4 wijth the rankling of his two Wounds 
that he could go no farther J fo we were oblig'd to take a 
new Guide these, and go to Tfoioufe, where we found a 
warm Climate, a fruitful plea&nt Country and no Snow, 
no Wolves, or any Thing like them ; but when we told 
our Story at Tbolotifc they told us it was nothing but

the Mountains, efpecially when the Snow lay on ithe , 
Ground : But they enquir'd much what kind of'-a tiuide ; 
we had gotten, that would venture to bring us that 
Way in liich a fevere Seafon, and told us, it was very " 
much we were not all devour'd : When we told them 
how we plac'd our lelves, and the Hories in the middle, 
they blam'd us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to 
one but we had been all deftroy'd ; for it was the Sight 
of the Hories. which made the Wolves fo furious, feeing 
their Prey.; and that at other Times they are really a- 
fraid of a Gun: but they being exceflive Hungry, and 
raging on that Account, the Eagernefs to come at 'the 
Hories had made them fenfeleis of danger ', and that 
if we had not by the continued Fire, and at laft by the 
Stratagem cf the Train of Powder, mafter'd- them, it 
had been great Odds but that we had been torn to Pie- 
ces ; whereas had we been content to have fat {till on 
Her fe- back, and fired as Horiemen, they would not have 
taken the Hories ib much for their own whenMen where 
o-n their Backs, as otherwife ; and withal they told'fas, 
that at lair, if we had ftood altogether, and left our Hor- 
fts, they would have been fo* eager to have devour'd* 
them, that we might have come off fafe, efpecially 
having our Fire Arms ia our Hands, and being fo many 
In Number, 

For my Part, I was never fo fenfible of Danger in my 
Life v for feeing above three hundred Devils come roar-

: Security of my EfE&s ; and indeed, I was very happy 
from my Beginning, and now to the End, in the unipot- 

. ted Integrity of this good Gentlewoman. 

And now I began to think of leaving my EfTecfs with 
this Woman, and letting out for Lisbon, and ib to . the 
Brafils ; But now another Scruple came in my Way, and 
that was Religion} for as I had entertain'd ibme Doubts 
about the Roman- Religion, even while I was abroad, 
efpecially in my State of Solitude \ ib [ knew there was 
no going to the Brafils for me, much lefs going to fettle 

"there, unlefs 1 refolv'd to embrace the Roman Catho- 
lic^ Religion, without anyReferve; except on the othsr 
hand, I refolv'd to be a Sacrifice to my Principles, be 
a Martyr for Religion, and die in the Inquifition ; jo 
I refolv'd to (lay at Home, and if I could find Means 

Tor it, to difpofe of my Plantation. 

... To this Purpofe I wrote to my old Friend at Lisbon^ 

ivvho in Return gave me Notice, that he could eafiiy 

, difpofe of it there : But that, if I thought fit to give 
him Leave to offer it in my Name to the two Merchants, 
the Survivors of my Truftees who liv'd in. the Brafih> 

"who miift fully underftand the Value of it, who liv'd 
jufl: upon the Spot, and who I knew were very rich, 
ib that he believ'd they would be fond of buying it \ he 
did not doubt, but I fhould make 4 or 50QO Pieces of 

' Eight the more of it. 

Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer it to 
them, and he did fo j and in about eight Months more, 
the Ship being then return'd, he fent me an Account* 
that they had accepted the Oifer, and had remitted 
33000 Pieces of Eight, to a Correfpondent of theirs at 
Lisbon, to pay for it. 

In Return, I figned the Inftrument of Sale in the 

Form, which they fent from Lisbon* and fent it to my 

old Man, who fent me Bills of Exchange for 32800 

O 2 Pieces 



( W ) 

Pieces of Eight for the Eftate ; refer viilg tfie Pay- 
ment of ico Moidores a Year to him, the old Man, 
during his Life, and 50 Moidores afterwards to his 
Son for his Life, which I had promis'd them •, and which 
the Plantation was to make good as a Rent-Charge. 
And thus I have given the iirfl Part of a Life of 
Fortune and Adventure, a Life of Providence's Chec- 
cjuer-Work, and of a Variety which the World will 
ieldom be able to (hew the like of: Beginning fooliih- 
ly, but clofing much more happily than any Part or it 
ever gave me Leave fo much as to hope For. 

Any one would think, that in this State of compli- 
cated good Fortune, I was pad: running any more Ha- 
zards \ and fo indeed I had been, if other Circumftances 
had concurred, but l was innured to a wandering Life, 
had no Family, nor many Relations, nor, however rfcli 
had I conrra&ed much Acquaintance ; and though I had 
fold my Eftate in the Brafits, yet I could not keep that 
Country out of my Head, and had a great Mind to be 
upon the W ing again, efpqeiafly I could not ; rejfift the 
Strong Inclination I had to fee my Ifland, and to know 
if the poor Spaniards were in Being there, and how tHe 
Rogues I left there, had ufed them.' 

My true Friend the Widow, eafneftly difwaded me 
from it, and fo far prevaiPd with me, that for ahttoft 
feven Years fhe prevented my running abroad ydurinjg 
which Time, I todkmy two Nephews, the Children of 
one of my Brothers, into my Care* The el deft having 
fomethingof his own I bred up as a Gentleman, and 
gave him a Settlement of fome Addition to his Eftate, 
after my Deceafe ; the other I put out to a Captain o£V 
: a Ship; and after five* Years, finding him a fenfible, 
bold, enter prizing young Fellow, I put hitri into a good 
Ship, and lent him to Sea :. And this young Fellow af- 
terwards drew me in^ as old as I was, to farther. Adven- 
tures my fclf. 

In the mean time, I in part fettled my felf here ; for 
firft of all I marry'd, and that not either to my Difad- 
vantage ox Diifatisla&ion, and had three Children, two 
Sons and one Daughter: But my Wife dying, and my 
Nephew coming Home with good Succefe from a Voy- 
age toSpahy my Inclination to go abroad, and his Im- 
portunity, 



< m ) 



portunity, prevailed and ehgag'd me to go in his Snips 
as a private Trader to the Eafi-Indies : This was in the 
Year 1694. 

In this Voyage I vifited my new Colony in the Ifland, 
Taw my Succeflbrs the Spaniards, had the whole Story 
of their Lives, and of the Villains I left there, how at 
,£rft they infulted the poor Spaniards, how they after- 
wards agreed, difagreed, united, feparated, and how at 
lad the Spaniards were oblig'd to ufe Violence with 
them ; how they were fubjecled to the Spaniards ; how 
honefily the Spaniards us*d them ; a Hiftory, if it were 
enter'd into, as full of Variety and wonderful Acci- 
dents, as my own Part, particularly alfo as to their Bat- 
tles with the Carribeans, who landed feveral times upon 
the Ifland, and as to the Improvement they made upon 
the Ifland itfelf, and how fire df them made an Attempt 
upon the main La^d, and biiought away eleven Men and 
five Women Prifoners, by which, at my coming, I found 
about twenty young Children on the Ifland. 

Here I ftay 'd about 20 Days, left them Supplies of all 
jnejceflary Things, and particularly of Arms, Powder, 
Shot, Cloaths, Tools, and two Workmen, which I 
brought from England with me> vi\. a Carpenter and a 
Smith* 

Befides this, I fhar'd the Ifland into Parts with 'em, 
referv'd to myfelf the Property of the whole, but gave 
them fuch Parts, refpe&ively as they agreed on ; and 
having fettled all Things with them, and engaged them 
not to leave the Place, I left them there. 
' From thence I touch'd at the Brafih, from whence I 
fent a Bark, -which I bought there, with more People, 
to the Iflatid, and in it, befides other Supplies, I ient 
feren Women, being fuch as I found proper for Ser- 
vice, or for Wives to fuch as would take them : As to 
the Englijb Men, I promii'd them to (end them fome 
Women from EngUnd, with a good Cargo of NecefTa- 
ries,if they would apply themfelves to Planting, which I 
afterwards could not perform : The Fellows prov'd very 
honeft and diligent, after they were mafter'd, and had 
their Properties fet apart for them, i fent them alfo 
from the Brrfils five Cows, three of them being big 

with 



xvith Calf, f<?nie Sheep> and fome . Hogs,, which*, when 
I Came again, were confieler ably epcreas'cj. 

* But all thefe Things, with an Account how 300 Ci- 
r'tbbes came and invaded them, and ruin'd their Planta- 
tions, and how. they fought with that whole Number 
twice, and were, at firil. defeated, and one of them 

'kill'd ; but at laft a Storm deftroying their Enemies Oa- 

'noes, they faml(h*d or deftroy'd altnoft all the reft, aad 
renew'd and recover'd the Poifefllon of their Plantation, 

. and dill Kv'd upon the Iftarid. * > 

AH thefe Things, with fome very fur prizing Inci- 
dents in fome new Adventures of my own, for ten Years 
more, I may perhaps give a farther Account of here- 
after.
