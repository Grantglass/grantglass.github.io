My dear little Friend: :

l have here added to my already long lie: of
" Tenua'e Tun." a new edition of the wonderful adventure. of Roa-
meou Crunch--one of the roost popular fictiona ever blished. In
writing the story over again, IO as to get it into a book of in size, I have
been careful to give you as much of the original as possible. I hope
this new edition will be as popular with you as the larger onea hove ever
been with older readers than you are.

And here let me remind you, that though thin celebrawd etory it not
strictly true, yet it is founded on fact. Alexander Selkirk, a Sootehman,
was put ashore on the uninhabited Island of Juan Fernandez. by hia angry
captain, with only a gun and some powder and shot, to mietbim in gain-
ing a livelihood. This island is situated in the Pacific Ocean, about 330
miles from Chili. Here Selkirk remained nearly five yearn, living on fish,
fowl, and goat's rnillt. At length, in the year 1709, a ahip passing by took
him on board and carried him home. His adventurea were the foundation

of the story of Robinson Crusoe. the original of which won written by all
English gentleman. named De Foe. .

I trust you will all find much in these pogea to instruct. as well an to
amuse and interest you. You can hardly fail to Smpathtae deeply with

this lonely individual. cut oll'l'or many year: from oompamonahrp and in-
teroourae with his fellow-men. and subjected to almost every privation and
hardshi . Nor eon you help admiring the fortitude and resignation with
which e aubrnitted to his og--eonstantly acknowledging the goodness
and mercy of GOD in his protection and preservation, and lino; in the
deil practice of every virtue. . _ '

ay you all become, like him. induatnoue, patient. ready to relieve the
dietreeeed. humble, submissive, obedient to your parents. and above all,to
your Heavenly Father; then, whatever may be your lot on earth, you will
assuredly be happy, both in this world and m that which II to come.

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

ROBINSON CRUSOE.

 

There lived in the town of Essex, in England, a man by
the name of Crusoe, who had three sons, the two oldest of
whom died young; in the youngest, therefore, whose name
was Robinson, Mr. and Mrs. Crusoe placed all their hopes
and expectations. They loved him with a blind and injudi-
cious love, and the consequence was, he grew up self~willed
and disobedient. '

Robinson was already a stout lad, before his parents had
determined what profession he should follow. His father
was anxious he should learn a trade, but the son had no such
inclination. He wished to travel and see the ,world, and be-
come acquainted with the various manners and customs of
foreign countries

One day when, according to custom, he was strolling idly
about the streets, he met one of his old playfellows, whose
father was captain of a ship trading to Amsterdam. He told
Robinson that he was to sail with his father, in a day or two.
{3; Amsterdam, and asked if he should not like to go with
"Indeed I should, very mu ," replied Robinson, :but
my ts will not consent to it." " r

are. We shall be back againin amonth orsixweeh; I 0'4 Lin: AND anvenruaas

as to your father and mother. you have only to let them
know where you are gone. Come, my father's vessel is at
Plymouth, and we will start for there in the first coach."

Robinson hesitated a moment, as if considering what res-
olution to take; at last, slapping his companion's hand, he
cried. "Agreed, my boy! I will go along with you; let us
set oil" at once for Plymouth." At the same time he asked
a friend to tell his father, the next day, that he was only one
to Amsterdam, and would be home again in a few wee .

Immediately on their arrival at Plymouth they went on
board the ship, and in a few hours the anchor was weighed
and they set sail. Robinson was on the deck with his friend,
and almost out of his wits with joy that he had at last com-
menced his travels. The evening was fine, and they soon
lost sight of the town and harbor of Plymouth. They were
now u Mm the open sea, and Robinson stared with wonder
and 'admirznion when he saw nothing around him but tl e
sky and the water.

For several days the weather was as fine as possible.
But all of a sudden a violent hurricane arose from the south-
east, and continuing for nearly a week, carried the shi so
far out of the way, that no person on board knew w ere
they were. One morning, just at day-break, the cry of
" Land !" from a sailor at the masthead, threw the whole
crew into a sudden fit of joy. They hastened' on deck to
see what this land was; but at that very moment the shi
struck upon a sand bank, and stuck as fast as if suddenly and
securely nailed to the spot! The foaming waves then dashed
over her deck with such violence that all hands rushed be-
low, for fear of being washed overboard. '

Suddenly some one cried out that the ship had lit!
These dreadful tidings caused them to rush hastily on eck
again; the boat was lowered as fast as possible, ends]!

jumped into it in the greatest alarm and despair. But then.1 . n

were so many in the boat, that its sides were scarcely four
inches above the water, and it seemed impossible ever to
reach the libero. N eVerthelertu, they rowed with all their
might. All at once a huge wave. mouutnin high, struck the
boat. and all were instantly swallowed u in the doc !

Bu! the same droudlhl wave dashed l ohinson wit -such
violence upon the shore, that he was aroused from insensi-
hility, and seeing himself upon dry ground, he exerted his
strength to gain a hunk which was out of reach ofthe waves.
This he reached, but fainted nwuy immediately, and lay for
some time without sense or motion. When he recovered,
he looked around; but, alas! there was nothing to be seen
but a few broken planks, which the waves drove towards
the shore. He alone was saved, out of the whole ship's
company!

Trembling with fear and joy, he fell upon his knees, and
with a flood of tears returned thanks to the Maker of heaven
and earth for his preservation. When his joy had a little
subsided, he looked about him, but could not perceive any
signs that the country was inhabited. Fear kept him mo.
tionless; he did not dare stir, till a burning thirst forced him
from this state of inaction, and sent him wandering about
in search of a spring or brook of water. Luckily, he found
a brook, where he quenched his thirst to his utmost wish.

Robinson returned thanks to God for this, hoping that he
would also vouchsafe him food. " He who feeds the fowls of
the air," said he, " will not suffer me to perish with hunger!"

But the question was, where to pass the night! On the
ground, in the open air. where he would be exposed to sav-
ages, or wild beasts? House, or cabin, or cave, he saw no
signs of. What should he do? At last be determined to
imitate the birds, and seek a retreat in some tree. Select-

 

ing one whose houghs were thick and closely interwoven. .

'so that he could sit among them securely, he climbed up"

offered an on most prayer to God for pardon and protection,
and then settling himself, fell fast asleep in a moment, and
lay quietly until sun-rise. '

He then hogan earnestly to consider what he should do
for thod. All the trees that. he had seen were such as never
hear any fruit, and what. should he do? He rambled about
for several hours, hut found nothing. At. length he per-
ceived a number of shells on the shore, and searching among
them, he found a few oysters which had been thrown ashore
by the waves. These he ate greedily ; and though they did
not satisfy his hunger, they enabled him to forget it for a
short time.

He now climhed to the top of a hill, from whence he
could see a great distance. To his infinite grief he perceived
that he was on an island, within sight of which there was no
land, except a few smaller islands which rose out of the sea
near his own.

" Poor, unhappy wretch that l am l" said he; " I am in-
deed cut off from all men, and have no hopes of ever being
delivered from this desolate and savage place! Oh, my
poor parents, I shall never see you more; but I am justly
punished {hr my fitlly and disobedience, for thou, Lord. art
igust in all thy ways." Then throwing himself on his knees,

o. lifted up his heart to Heaven. promising to be patient in
all his distresses, and praying for strength to support them.

Finding himself much strengthened, he began to travel
around the hill, hoping to find some place where he might
sleep in safety. At length he came to a little hill, which in
front was as steep as a. wall. Examining this attentively,
he found one spot which was considerably hollowed out an-
der the hill, with a pretty narrow entrance to it. If he had
a pickaxe, crowhar, and other tools, it would be an easy
matter to hollow out a complete dwelling-place under this
rock, which was already partly done by nature. But he
had none of these tools, and the question was, how he should
supply the want of them.

After puzzling his head a while, he said to himself, " some
of the trees here, are like the willows of my own country,
which are easily transplanted. I will plant quite a number
of the young ones before this cave, close together, and when
they grow up retty high, I shall be able to sleep here as
securely as if was in a house; for behind I shall have the
wall of this steep rock, to secure me, and in front, as well as
on both sides, the close row of trees will keep off all danger."

This happy thought pleased him so much that he set
about putting the plan m execution. His joy was still
greater when he discovered near by, a beautiful spring of
pure water, of which he hastened to drink, as he was ex~
tremely thirsty. .9 4'

Robinson now set about pulling up the young trees,"
planting them in their destined places, which he effected
with at difficulty, for having no tools, he was obliged to
aerate holes in the ground with his hands. Of course his
work went on very slowly, and as the day closed he had
fixed but five or six of them. Hunger now obliged him to
go to the shore and search for a few oysters; but the tide
being up, he could find none, and was obliged, therefore, to
go to his bed in the trees supperless.

Early in the morning he set out again to look for eye.
ters. Happening to go another way, he found a cocoa-nut
tree loaded with fruit. This was an agreeable treat for his
empty stomach, and he looked up to Heaven with sensations'
of the warmest itude. Though his hunger was now
satisfied, yet he did not omit going to the shore, where he
found a few oysters, which he carried home for his dings;
and then set about planting his trees again. Having found
on the beach a large shell, he was able to advance his 1"

Having, in the course of several days, planted tree close
by tree until he had completely enclosed tlte spot intended
for his dwelling with twu rows, be filled up tlte s ace be-
tween thcm with earth, thus making a solid wal , which
would require considerable force to push it down. Every
morning be. watered his little plantation with water from
the spring, which he brought in his cocoa-nut shells, and
soon had the satisfaction: of" seeing them sprout and flourish
so as. to afford a charming view to the eye.

Having discovered a plant, the stalk of which was full of
threark, like flax, or hemp, he had gathered a quantity of
it. hoping to be able to use it in making cords, or ropes,
when he should need them. Accordingly, as soon as he had
finished his hedge, he turned his attention to rope-making.
In this he succoeded so well, that he soon formed a rope~
ladder, which he titstened to a large tree on the top of the
rock, over his habitation, and let it hang quite down to the
ground. He then tried to climb up by it, and found it to
answer his purpose to admiration.

All being new finished. his next thought was, how to en-
large the little hollow under the rock; but this he could not do
without tools of some kind. He remembered having seen
a great number of hard green stones at a certain place, and
immediately going to search among them, he found one which
made him jump for joy ; it had the ver form of a hatchet,
and even a hole to fit the handle in! Vidith a world of labor
and ains, he managed to enlarge this hole, and then fitting a
hat: e, he took some of his cord and fastened it in quite firm.

Searching again among the stones, he found two more,
equally fit for use, one of which answered very well for a
mallet, and the other for- a chisel. With these tools he
managed to clear out the hollow so that it seemed large -
enough for him to sleep in, like a human creature, instead
of being obliged to perch in a tree like a bind.

That he might not forget the order of the days, but know
when it was Sunday, so as to keep the day holy. he selected

four trees near his cave, and on the first he made, every.

evening, a notch. When he had made seven notches, the
week was ended. Then he made on the next tree, another
notch, to express a week. As often as he had completed
four notches on the second tree, he made one on the third,
for a month; and when he had made thirteen notches on
the third tree, he made one on the fourth; to show that a
whole year had passed. Thus he made out to keep the or-
der of time, as well as if he had an Almanac.

Finding only one cocoa-nut tree near his habitation, and
but very few oysters on the shore, Robinson felt quite un~
easy about his so )ply of food. Fearful and cautious, he
had not hitherto dared to go any great distance from his
dwelling. Bot necessity now com lled him to venture, in
order to seek for provisions. Wit 1 this intent, he resolved

to traverse the whole island, trusting in God to protect hint: '
from savages and wild beasts, should he meet with any'itt.

But in order to protect himself from the great heat of the
son, he spent a whole evening in making an umbrella.
With some small willow sticks, and the broad leaves of the
cocoa-nut tree, he managed to make one so close that not a
single ray of the sun could penetrate it.

He arose early in the morning, and grepared for his jour-
ney. With a bag, which he had made rem some of his cord,

Just at. this moment a noise in the distance threw him into
an awful fright. "e. looked around in great, terror, and
was surprised to see a troop of wild animals, called Lamas,
which are somewhat like our deer in shape and size. Im-
mediately on seeing them approach, Robinson felt. a longing
desire to eat. some roast. meat, which he had not tasted in u.
long time. So standing,r close. beside. the tree, he waited pa-
tiently for one of the troop to approach him. In a few
moments one of them passed very near where he stood,
when Robinson gave it a stroke on the neck, with his stone
hatchet, which laid it dead in a moment.

He never thought of askin},r himself how he was to cook
the meat which he had thus secured, but taking the lama on
his shoulders. he hastened honlewards. ()n the way he made
another discovery, which gave him intinitejoy ; this was sev-
eral lemon trees. laden with ripe fruit, in few ofwhicb he se-
cured, and carefully min-king the spot where the trees grow,
continued his route home.

There his first business was to skin the animal. which he
ell'ected with a sha ) flint, and prudently preserving the skin
for clothing. whichrite saw he should stmn need, he carefully
dressed the arena, cutting off a hind quarter to toast. For
this he made. a spit, which he fixed in two notched sticks
driven upright in the ground. All he. wanted now was tire,
and reenlleeting that he had read of savages iroducing it by
rubbing two dry sticks together, be resolved to procure it
in the same way. He rubbed so briskly that the sweat ran
down his face, but without success; for when the wood be-
came heated by his exertions, until it smoked, he was so
tired that he could rub no longer, and the wood cooled a 'a.

What was now to he done? With plenty of f 5 he
was still in danger of starvation: ! At: last: he recollected to
have heard that the Tartars at the meat which they mean-
to eat, under their horses' saddles, and so bake it, as it won,
 

by riding at full gallop. This, said he, can be done as well '
another way; and be resolved to try. Accordingly he went
to search for two stones, broad and smooth, which having
(hand, he placed a piece of meat between them, and then
striking With his stone mallet upon the uppermost one, for
five or six minutes, the stones began to grow warm, which
made him continue his blows for some time longer. In less
than half an hour, from the heat of the stones and the pres.
sure and weight of the blows, the meat became quite tender
and fit to eat, especially when he had squeezed a. little lemon
juice upon it.

After he had made an end of eating, he debated in his
own mind what work would be most necessary to set about.
The dread of winter made him think of killing a great num'
her of l'amas, in order to use their skins as a protection
against the cold weather. As these animals appeared to be
pretty tame, he ho wed to be able to accomplish this without
much trouble. ith this hope, he went to bed and slept
soundly.

Rising early in the morning, he was going at once to put
his plans in execution, but found the weather would not per<<
mit, for it rained incessantly, accompanied also by lightning
so bright, that his cave, which was usually pretty dark,
seemed all in a blaze; and then the flashes were accompa- -
nied by such claps of thunder as he had never heard before 1;,

the rock which had fallen down was surrounded on every
side by soil earth, and was likely to fall down at any time.
Had it not fallen while he was out of the cave, he would
have been in constant danger whenever he was beneath it.
Thanking God, therefm-e, for his great escape, he cheerfully
set nlmut clearing away the ruins.

It was a slight task to remove the earth; but the eat
stone, though broken in twu, seemed more than enoug for
the strength of one lusrson. Finally, recollecting that he
had in his youth seen Workman make use of a lever, when
they wanted to move heavy articles, he hastened to make
trial of one, and succeeded so well that he soon rolled the
tWo stories out of his cave. He now had the satisfaction of
finding his habitation twice as lar re as before, and qitite so-
cure too; for both the walls aml t to ceiling appeared to be
one solid rock.

And now he not about )erfin'ming the duty of cook. He
fixed a "eve of meat on his spit once more, and kindling a
tire ntn or it, marked it to his entire satisfaction. The joy
with which he tasted of the first slice, canbe hotter imagined
than described.

After this, the main object was how to keep his fire, and
this <<xzcasioned him some study and pe laxity. At last,

make bricks. he now determined to attempt it. So taking
his shell spade and stone hatchet, he repaired at once to the
spot. Here he found that the heavy ram had made the clay
quite soft. and there was no difliculty in ehepin it into
bricks, ofwhich he prepared a good aamhc. hese he)8 Lin: um Anvnm'unn

it to his houi-t's mntont, he sat down to reflect on what piece
of work he should commence next. As his bricks needed
time to hut-den in the sun, he could not yet begin his chim-

ut the sumo time provide food. to much a couple of lamas

preparations.

This was indeed a prize. for though he had in some meas-

suited in this way would keep but a very short time.

removed a part of the alisading, or wall, in front of his cave,
which allowed them t e range of both enclosures.

The lamas soon grew fond of his society, and as often as
he came home would jump and (risk about him, gratefully
licking his hand whenever he brought them fresh grass and
young branches to eat.

He soon weaned the young ones, and then began milking
the dam every morning and evening, using his cocoa-nut
shells for pails and milk pans. This milk, which he used
partly sweet, and partly cnrdled, contributed not a little to
render his solitary life still more toferable.

Both the old and the young lamas soon grew as tame as
dogs, and Robinson by degrees learned them to carry small
hnrthens for him, especially whenever he went out for an
thing that he could not bring home conveniently. For this
purpose he managed to make bags, which he could fasten
across the backs of the animals.

His bricks having become hardened in the sun, he made
the old lama bring them home for him, and alter much labor
and perseverance he succeeded in his masonry v well, and
had the satisfaction to find that his lire-place a chimney
were all that he could hope for. He now turned his thoughts
towards la ing in a stock of provisions for the winter. ,ith
this intent e caught eight more lamas, which he killed and
dressed. The greatest part of the flesh of these he hung up
in his chimney to dry and smoke; but first'he let it lie some
days in salt. as he well remembered having seen his mother
do. when she made bacon. '

He also collected a large quantity of grass, which he
dried in the sun and then stacked in is enclosure, for he
learns to feed on. After this. he proceeded to gather wood
{or his winter's fuel. But before he had eted his
work, the rainy season set in. and confined him a most en-
tirely to his cave. Althoughait was now nearly November.24 use mo novnsrunns

the cold weather which he had so much dreaded. was not
felt in the least; but it rained ineossaatl for several weeks,
and poor Robinson was all this time. a r use prisoner.

How heavily the hours crept on! Nothing to do, and all
alone! At length he doternnned to iind something to em-
rloy his time. and having on hand a good supply of hemp,
he set about making a fishing net. In this he succeeded be-
yond his expmttations. and was thereby encouraged to at-
tempt other things. \Vith a great deal of labor he managed
to make a how and arrows. pointing the latter with some
sharp iish bones which 'Il' found on the beaeh. After this
be. determined to make a lam-o. or spear. which would serve
to defend him from savages or wild beasts, should be en-
eotllm't' any. For this purpose he cut a long. straight stall;
of the proper size. and having seleeted a sharp flint. he made
out. to fasten it on very securely. for a head to his spear.

'l'hese weapons being linislwd, liobiusou looked n ma
them with a great deal oi'grntilioation ntanride. True I my
were not very smooth. for he wanted iron tools to make
them so; but still he found them to promise tolerable good
service. With his bow and arrows he did not doubt being
able. to shoot. birds and other small animals; and his lance.
or spear. with its shar ) that. head, was truly a lbrmidahlo
looking weapon. Wit 1 this in his hand, he lelt a degree of
safety which he had not known belbro.

lint the rainy Season had not yet. abated, and Robinson
began to ask lnmsell'whut piovo of work he should under-
take. next. After meditating a long time, he resolved to at-
tempt making some earthen pots and dishes. Accordingly
he at once ran out, notwithstanding the rain, to seek some of
the proper kind of clay for this mrlmso. This he soon
found. and immediately commenced operations. He found
no difficulty in making his wares ot'tlm proper shape; but
it was only idler repeated trials and disammintments thator aostssos cnvsos. 25

 

 

 

he succeeded in baking them hard enough to be of any use
to him. Determined, however, to do nothing by halves, he
tried experiment after ex riment, till be accomplished his
wishes; and. considering is want of tools, he finally turned
out several articles which would have done credit to a regular
mttet'y.

I At last the weather began to clear up, and Robinson felt.
sure the winter was now about to set in. But, behold! the
winter was already past! He could scarcely believe his

eyes, when he saw every appearance of spring! The grass .

was springing up. the trees budding out, and the flowers
blossoming all around him. He had never before been in a
climnto like this, and could not understand it; but it was
("'("I H".

He had now no occasion for warm clothing to protect him
from the ('nlti weather,--u matter which had hitherto aused
him no little unmlsiuoml. lint still he had much occ on for
something to protect him from the bite of insects, particularly
mnsketoes, with which his island abounded. 'he bite of

annoyed him greatly. ii is clothes being by this time nearly
Worn out, he determined to supply their places by making
new ones from the skins of the lamas which he had killed.

This was an undertaking which caused him much labor
and porploxity. But at last, by dint of ingenuity, industry,
patience. and perseverance, he finished a jacket, trowsers,
and cap. It is true they were roughly made, for he had
neither scissors, needle, or thread to work with; and they
were too stiti' and harsh to be very comfortable at first; but
he soon got used to them, and they served to rotect his
body from _the attacks of the musketoes, much tter than
his old tattered clothin .

A little farther on, he discovered a tree with fruit as large
as that of the cocoa-nut tree, but without either shell or husk ;
the whole was eatahlo, and of an ex uisite flavor. He learned
afterwards that this was the bra ofruit tree; so called be-
cause the fruit serves for bread, sometimes just as it grows,
but more commonly pounded and made into dough. Hav-
ing observed that the trunk of this tree, which was straight
nnd very large, was a little hollowed on one side, from its
grout ago, he immediately thought it would answer for the
caniie ho had in contemplation. But then, how was he to
cut it down, and hollow it out sufficiently? Again, should
he cut down so useful a tree. while it was quite uncertain if
he should ever be able to make a canoe of it 1 This thou ht
startled him. and unable to make u his mind, he carefufily
marked the spot where it grow, an continued his journey
without having determined the question.

in his walk he found a arrot's nest, which gave him a
grout deal of iloasuro. {e climbed up to it without the
least noise, an: securing the only parrot in the nest, which
was a young one, hastened home more gratified than if he
had found a treasure. He had long wished to find a arrot,
hopin to be able to learn it to speak, that he mig tonee
more car a voice that imitated that of man.

When he arrived home. he made a cage as Well sshe
could, in which he placed his new guest, and placing it on
one side of his bed. went to rest With a mind as happy as
that of a man who had found a new friend.

Robinson passed the night in reflecting whether he should
cut down the bread-fruit tree. It was a question of .too

 

 

much importance to decide hastily. He remembered theta- .

hle of the dog and the shadow, and thought if he should cut
down the tree and not succeed in maltin a canoe of it, he

should be something like the d . On e other hand, he
remembered that the farmer ris his grain when he sows

it. with the hope of being repaid by a. plentiful harvest.
" Yes," said he, " the dog snatt'ltt'd at a shadow, wltirh it
was impossible for him to possess. But aml not in the
situation of the farmer. ant may 1 not. reasonably hope to
make. a canoe of this old treel If I succeed. I shall have
the. means of escaping from this solitary island, to some place
inhabited by men !"

This thought made a lively impress'on on him, and he
started up at. that moment, took his lltllhlcl, ran to the tree
and cut into it.

If he ever undertook a long and troublesome task, it. was
this. A thousand other men would have been discouraged.
But Robinson did not. sulli'r himself to be diverted from a
)urpose which he had well considered. on account. of the la-
mr required. Still the undertaking seemed almost. extrava-
gant. From sunrise tmtil mmn, he never ceased working,
and then one of his hands would have tilled up the hole he
had cut.

Being convinced that this would be a work of some years.
be determined to divide his time and occn iations. so that
each part of the day might have its own work allotted to it-
self. Experience taught. him. that nothing hel )3 industry so
much as a pro wr distribution of work to the (lltfliwrent hours
of the day. l e therefore allotted his time and occupations
as follows :

Rising every morning at break of day, he went directly
to the a firing, where be washed his head. hands, breast, and
feet. I aving no cloth to wipe himself with, he let the air
dry his body, by running straight home to the top of the
hill over his cave, where he had a. view of his whole island.
Here he performed his morning devotions, praying to his
Heavenly F other to have mercy on him, and on his )00!' pa-
rents whom he had forsaken but never forgotten. e then
descended to his cave, milked his little flock of lama, and
I .__,.____.,._~...mvmm.~ .. 5"me

breakfasted on some of the new milk, putting the remain-
der away for his dinner and supper. After this he went
down to the shore. if it was low water, and gathered what
oysters he could find, and then repaired to the tree of which
he intended to make his canoe. His lamas usually fol-
lowed him, and grazed about while he was at work.

About ten o'clock, the heat was generally so excessive,
that he was obli ed to quit his work. He then went to the
sea-side to look or oysters, if he had not found any in the
morning, aml at the same time to bathe, which he did regu-
larly twice every day. Before noon he returned home, with
his flock. He now milked his la mas a second time, pre~
pared a sort of cheese of the milk which had curdled, and
then sat down to dinner, which being tolerable frugal, was
soon despatchcd. At dinner time he amused himself with
his nrrot; he spoke to it, and often repeated certain words,
wit I the hope of hearing it pronounce them some day.

After dinner he commonly reprised himself awhile, either
in his cave, or in the shade of a tree, surrounded by his lamas,
and with his parrot at his side. Sometimes he would fix his
eyes upon his flock, and speak to them as if he expected them
to answer him. When his parrot re rented a word, he would
almost imagine he heard the voice 0 a man, and then, in the
height of his joy fancy himself among human creatures. But
soon recovering from this pleasing illusion, he would sigh
heavily, and repeat aloud, " Poor Robinson !"

About two o'clock he returned again to his tree, and con-
tinued two hours each time at this laborious task; then he
went to the beach to bathe again, and gather more oysters.
The remainder of the day he usually spent about his habita-
tion. Sometimes he planted a hedge to enclose his garden;
at other times be cropped the willows which surrounded the
space before his cave, or bent and fixed their branches in

such a way as to form a kind of bower. At sunset, if he had32 urn AND ADvnN'ruans

no important business on hand, he usually ractised shooting
with his bow, and throwing his spear. y degrees he ac-
quired great skill with these weapons, and seldom missed a
mark of the size of a dollar, even at a pretty good distance.
When night came on, he milked his lamas the third time. and
then ate a moderate supper. Lastly, he crowned his labors
by meditating on his conduct during the day. if this had
satisfactory, he sung a hymn to the raise of that Being who
had thus assisted him one step on t e road to virtue.

Three years thus passed away, and Robinson's manner of
living was just the same. In all this time, though he had
constantly labored, except in the rainy season, he had
scarcely cut through half the trunk of the tree. But he did
not slacken his work, although his progress was indeed very
discouraging. One day the thought struck him, that as he
had seen but a very small part of the island, he would leave
his labor for a day or two, and traverse over the whole of
it. He was angry with himself when he reflected that fear
had hitherto prevented him from knowing whether the other
by" of the island did not produce something which might

of great use to him. Accordingly, he set out the very
next morning, fully armed and equipped, and accompanied
by one of his lamas loaded with provisions for four days.
But first he prayed for Divine protection from savages and
wild beasts, and every other kind of danger.

The first part of his journey was not remarkable for any
extraordinary circumstance; but he plainly perceived that
his side of the island was the most barren part of it. At the
southern extremity, however, he found the soil quite sandy.
Here he had a mind to walk out on a neck of land which
extended pretty far into the sea. But suddenly starting
back, he turned ale and was struck motionless! His eyes
discovered what he never expected to find there,---tlte track
quen': nakedfeet imprinted in the sand!
 

 

His consternation was dreadful! Ima 'ning that he was
in the midst of savages, ready to fall upon im, out his throat,
and then devour him, he at last took to flight, not daring to
look behind him. But suddenly he stops; his fear is changed
to horror! He sees a hole, and in the middle of it a space
where a fire had been kindled; all around were hands and
feet, and skulls, and other human bones,--the remains of an
unnatural feast, where a human body had been devoured!

Robinson turned away his face from this hideous and sick-
ening spectacle, nearly fainting. As soon as he had a little
recovered, he fled away again, with so much precipitation
that his faithful lama could scarcely keep up with him.

Quite worn out with fatigue, and his mind agitated with
fear and apprehension, he reached his cave just at dark, and
threw himself upon his bed com letely exhausted. Being
now in a place of comparative s ety, he soon recovered his
spirits, and then acknowledged that his fears had carried him
to an extravagant pitch. " I have been here," said he, " a
long time, and no savage has ever yet come near my habita-
tion, which is proof enough that they are not settled on this
island. It is most likel they belong to some other island,
and come here now an then, to celebrate their victories by
a horrible feast, and robably always land at the southern
point of the island. t is therefore rovidential that I was
thrown upon this most barren part 0 it. Why, then, should
I not continue to trust the same good Providence who has
thus graciously ordered all things for my good i"

Having recovered his strength by a night's rest, Robinson
resolved, the next morning, to take immediate measures for
the greater security of his habitation. With this design, he
planted a great number of trees at a little distance from his
enclosure, in such a way as to give the whole the appear.
anee of a natural growth, and by this means hide the rows
of trees whichhe had formerly planted. Next he determin-

ed to dig a subterranean passage from the bottom of his cave
to the other side of the hill, in order that he might escape that
way, if necessary. This was atcdious task,but by industry
and erseverance he finally accomplished it. and then flat-
tere himself he was tolerably secure from a sudden attack,
in case his habitation should be discovered.

For some years there happened nothing worth relating,
and Robinson continued laboring at his canoe, without sufi'er-
ing fear and anxiety to distress him so much as formerly.

One fine morning, while thus engaged, be perceived a thick
smoke rising at a. distance! liastening to the top of his rock
to discover the cause of the smoke, he was struck with dis-
may at the sight of six canoes drawn up on the beach. and a
score of savages dancing around a great tire, with the most
fantastic motions and horrid yells imaginable.

This time, although Robinson was in the greatest terror,
he soon recovered his spirits by placing confidence in his
Maker. He ran down to his cave to arm himself, and implo-
ring the assistance of Heaven, determined to defend his life
to the last extremity. Then he again ascended to the top
of the rock to watch the motions of the enemy. Presently
his indignation and horror were roused to the highest pitch,
as he saw the savages drag two untin'tunate wretches from
the canoes, one of whom they immediately despatehcd, and
commenced cutting in pieces, no doubt to prepare for their
dreadful feast. While this was going on, t to other prisoner
sat on the ground, a melancholy spectator of what was to be
his own fate. All at once, while the barbarians were busy
with their first victim, he started up and tied with astonishing
swiftness directly towards Robinson's dwelling- lace.

Joy, ho e, fear, and horror, alternately seize upon Rob-
inson. e felt a joy, mingled with he e, when he saw that
the prisoner gained considerably upon his pursuers; but he.
was filled with dread when he observed them all coming
a~w

 

directly towards his habitation. There was a small creek
between him and the savages, into which the prisoner threw
himself without hesitation, as'soon as he reached it. Two
of his nearest pursuers threw themselves in after him, while
the rest returned to their abominable feast. But the pursu-
crs were not near as expert swimmers as the fugitive; he
had landed before they were half across the creek.

At this moment Robinson was animated with a' zeal and
courage unknown to him before, and he determined to go to
the assistance of the weaker party. Running down from the
rock, with his spear in his hand, he passed through his grove,
and finding himself just between the ursueis and the pur-
sued. he called to the latter to "stop!' But be, terrified at
the sight of Robinson, in his dress of skins, hesitated whether
to run away, or full at the feet of one whom be supposed to
ho a superior being. Robinson, by signs, gave him to under-
stand that he was his friend; then turning towards the nearest
of the pursners. threw his spear and struck him dead. The
other savage, who was but a few yards behind, stopped quite
surprised, fixed an arrow and let it fly at Robinson, hitting
him on the breast, but, luckily. with no great force, and the
skins protected him as well as a breastplate could have done.
Robinson gave him no time to fix another arrow; be rushed
upon him and struck him lifeless in the dust.

()ur hero now taming towards the fugitive, who was still
motionless upon the same s 10!, wondering whether he too
was to fall beneath the mighty arm of this unknown being,
made many signs offriendship, and invited him to come close
to him. The savage at last obeyed, but with fear and trem-
bling, rostrating himself at his deliverer's feet, kissing the
groun , and making every sign of humility and submission.
Our hero held out his hand in a friendly manner, and made
him understand that he would protect him, and use him well.

But the savages would probably come that way to search
 

 

for their comrades and risoner; therefore Robinson made
the Indian understand t int he must gather up the bows and
arrows of the two savages and follow him. The Indian, in
return, signified by signs that it would be proper to bury the
two dead bodies in the sand, so that their companions should
not find them. Robinson approving of this precaution, the
Indian fell to work, and with only his hands soon dug a hole
and buried them. They then set out for Robinson's abode,
and ascended to the top of the rock, where, sheltered by a
large tree. they could see the savages still continuing their
horrid and unnatural revels. Presuming they would soon
commence a search for their companions and prisoner, Rob-
inson was irresolnte whether to fly or shut himself up in his
cave and defend it to the last extremity. At last, relying
upon his Divine Protector, he chose the latter alternative,
and making a sign to the Indian to follow him and do as he
did, they both descended to the cave. Here the Indian was
seized with the greatest surprise. He had never seen any
thing so well arranged and laid out, and his admiration and
astonishment were strongly expressed in his countenance.
Robinson endeavored to make him understand what they
had to fear, and that he was resolved to defend himself to the
last extremity. The Indian understood him perfectly, and
taking the hatchet, he brandished it several times over his
head, looking with a threatening air towards the enemy, as
if challenging them to combat; thus endeavoring to assure
his deliverer of his readiness to act his part courageously.
In about an hour, they heard strange and dreadful cries
from many savages together; presently the cries ceased, and
then began again, louder and nearer, till finally they seemed
close at hand. But our two heroes were not much alarmed;
the stood their ground manfully,--one armed with a spear,
an the other with a bow and arrows. The first savage who
showed himself would have received a mortal wound. But34.5"

the sound of voices soon died away, and after watching till
nearly dark, Robinson ventured to the top of his rock once
more, and was gratified to find the canoes had all departed.
Having thus happily escaped from immediate danger, he
set about preparing supper for himself and his guest, whom
he had scarcely, till now, found time to examine attentively.
He was a well made young man, about twenty years of age,
of a swarthy complexion, with hair long and black, nose small
and not very flat,---lips thin, and teeth as white as ivory.
As this day, so remarkable in the adventures of our hero,
happened to be Friday, he resolved to perpetuate the re-
membrance both of the day and the events which distin-
guished it, by giving his companion the name of Friday,---a
name to which the Indian soon became accustomed.
Robinson had now lighted up a fire, and putting a quarter
of a young lama before it, he instructed Friday how to turn
the spit. Then utting another piece of meat in one of his
earthen pots, an adding salt, Indian corn broken fine, and
some water, he set the pot over the fire. These preparations
seemed a mystery to Friday. He knew all about roasting
meat, but the rest of his master's cookery was beyond his
comprehension. He did not even know the efiect which fire
would produce on a vessel of water. The pot beginning to
boil just as Robinson went into the cave for something, he
was much surprised to see the water in motion, and imagin-
ing, in the simplicity of his heart, that there must be some
living creature at the bottom, he thrust his hand in to seize
it, lest it should make the water all boil over! But, instead
of a living creature, he felt something which made him roar
loud enough to startle his master into a paroxysm of fear
and anxiety. Robinson at once imagined that the savages
had surprised them, and taken Friday prisoner. The natural
instinct of self- reservation, urged him to escape by the secret
passage which e had dug; but he quickly rejected the idea,
 

 

 

and seizing his spear, rushed out with the determination to
rescue Friday or perish in the attempt.

What was his astonishment to find Friday all alone, crying,
twisting himself about, and making all manner of wry faces!
Robinson stood motionless, not knowing what to think. At
length be ascertained that all this outcry was occasioned by
the poor fellow's scalding his hand. He soon succeeded in
comforting him, and the broth and roast meat being ready,
they sat down to supper. But nothing could induce Friday
to touch the broth, which he had not the least doubt was an
enchanted liquor. He however made ample amends by a
plentiful supply of the roast meat, while it made him shudder
to see his master, whom he took for a supernatural being,
swallow the broth with much apparent satisfaction.

Robinson had never been so happily situated, since his
arrival on the island, as he was now. The more he saw of
his companion, the better he liked him. The young man was
frank, artless, and good natured, and ever evinced the great-
est afi'ection for his master, who at once set about teaching
him a few words of English every day. By this means they
were soon able to converse together quite intelligibly.

When the rainy season set in, they were obliged to find
employment in-doors, it being impossible to work in the open
air while the rain poured incessantly. What a happiness to
Robinson, at such a time, to have a friend to share his labors,
and with whom he could converse familiarly. He learned
from Friday, all the arts by which the savages supplied
themselves with any convenience, and in return instructed
him in many things of which savages never dream. Of the
bark of trees, Friday could make matting of a texture suffi-
ciently fine for clothing, and much more pleasant to wear than
the dried skins of lamas. He could also make cordage of the
stringy husks of the cocoa-nut, much stronger and better than
any that Robinson could make ; and he taught Robinson a
 

particular method of making nets,--an occupation which
employed a good part of their time during the wet season.

W'hen the rainy season was over, Robinson took Friday to
see the canoe which he had begun some years before. Fri-
day laughed heartily to see the work so little advanced, and
said that a great deal of time had been thrown away, for a
tree like that could be hollowed much better in a few days,
with fire. Hearing this, Robinson was transported with joy.
He fancied the work already done, and himself and Friday,
after a ha y voya e, landed on the continent! What a
delightful id)ea ! e resolved to begin the work at once.

Friday, as head carpenter, hollowed out the trunk of the
tree with fire. This method was so expeditious, that the
canoe was completed in two months, and now nothing was
wanting but sails and oars. The sails were furnished by
Friday, who constructed matting for the urpose, while
Robinson undertook to provide the oars. l:l'hese finished,
their next care was to get the canoe to the sea-side, about
half a mile distant. With the help of rollers, they were
able to launch it in two days, and to their great delight
found it 'to sail with great steadiness.

It now remained to lay in a stock of provisions for their
voyage, and this they accomplished at once. Then leaving
the canoe moored on the beach, they returned home, intend-
ing to start the next morning. About midnight they were
awakened by a violent storm, in which the wind roared and
the earth shook with repeated claps of thunder. "Do you
hear this i" asked Robinson. "I do," replied Friday, "and
am thinking what would become of us, if we were out at sea
in such weather." Just then they heard the report of a gun
at a great distance.

Starting suddenly from his bed, Robinson seized a brand
of fire, nd bade Friday follow him. Mounting the ladder,
he ma e haste to kindle a large fire on the top of the rock,42 LIFE AND Ansz'runss

 

to let the pea le on board of the ship know that they would
find a safe re uge on the island -, for he did not in the least
doubt there being a shi near at hand, and that the report of
the gun which he hear was a signal of their danger. But
the rain fell in torrents, and put out the fire as often as it was
kindled. Finally they were both obliged to descend to the
cave. All that now remained in Robinson's power to do for
the unfortunate people at sea, was to pray for them. This
he did with the greatest devotion

At day-break the storm subsided, when Robinson, ac-
companied by Friday, went to the sea-side full of hope and
fear, to see whether his conjectures were well or ill-founded.
But the first discovery they made filled them with despair.
The wind had driven their canoe out to sea! That canoe,
which had caused them so much toil and anxiety, and which
they had finally completed by the most incredible exertions,
was nowhere to be seen ! Poor Friday was overwhelmed
with grief at this disaster; but Robinson, having learned to
moderate his transports, was soon able to comfort his com-
panion. In the meantime he did not cease to cast his eyes
round to every part of the ocean, to see if there was not a
ship in sight; but there was not the smallest appearance of
one. Still his fancy ran upon a ship near the island, and he
again ascended to the top of his rock, from whence there was
a full view of the western shore. What was his joy when
he saw a ship! and so distinctly that he is sure of its being
quite a large one! He flies in the greatest haste to his cave,
snatches up his arms, and calling to Friday, "There they
are! quick! quick !" sets 03' with the utmost rapidity.

' From his master's agitation and haste, Friday supposed
the savages were at hand; taking n his arms, therefore,
he followed Robinson with all s eedi They had several
miles to go before they reache that part of the island,
where the vessel seemed to lie at anchor ; nor did Friday.Maughneflzurmm 6.. , _

learn the cause of his master's hurry until they arrived at
the spot. Robinson showed him the ship, apparently at an-
chor some distance from the shore. Friday could not con-
ceal his astonishment at seeing a vessel a hundred times
bigger than any thing of the kind he had ever seen.

Robinson tried to make the people on board hear him; but
to no purpose. Finally he begged Friday to make a fire
which might be seen on board the ship. This was soon done,
and the blaze rose as high as the trees, but without efi'ect.

At last Friday offered to swim to the ship, notwithstand-
ing the distance, and invite the people on shore. To this
Robinson consented joyfully, knowing Friday to be an ex-
cellent swimmer, as he had often witnessed his dexterity
and skill in this accomplishment. Accordingly Friday cuts
off a small branch, which he takes in his teeth, as a sign of
peace, and springing boldly into the waves, makes directly
for the ship, while Robinson accompanies him with his
eyes and best wishes. He arrived safely at the vessel, and
after calling out several times, without receiving an answer,
he ascended its sides by means of the rope ladder.

When he had mounted high enough to look all over the
deck, he was astonished at the sight of an animal such as he
had never seen in his life; it was covered with black wooly

 

 

hair, and as soon as it saw Friday it uttered such noises asi

perfectly surprised him. However, it soon ceased crying
out, and appeared so delighted at the appearance of Friday,
that he was no longer afraid of it, and finally ventured to
pat its head. He then walked over the deck. calling to the.
people, but no one answered him. While he was lost in
admiration at all he saw, he suddenly received a Violent
blow behind, which knocked him flat on the face. Getting
up in a great fright, he was perfectly petrified with conster-
nation on beholdlng a creature with crooked horns and lpng
bushy heard, rearing itself on its hind legs, and prepanng,

with a threatening air, for a second attack. Friday roared
out, as loud as he was able, and jumped into the sea.

The first of these animals,----a water spaniel,--jumped also
into the water, and swam after him. Friday, hearing the fall
of something behind him, made no doubt that he was pursued
by the horned monster, and terrified at the idea, was very
near drowning. Recovering, in a measure, though he did
not dare look behind him, he swam so fast that the spaniel
could scarcely keep up with him. When he got to the shore,
he fell down at Robinson's feet quite unable to speak, and
completely exhausted. It was some time before he could
relate to his master his terrible adventure.

Robinson listened to this story with some little surprise.
The horned monster. which Friday called the master of the
floating mountain of wood, he supposed to be a goat. As
to the ship, he concluded it was fast upon a rock, and that the
crew, fearing to be wrecked, had taken to their boats. He
now recollected the wind having changed during the night,
so that the boats must have been driven from the shore, and
perhaps had landed on one of the islands to the eastward.

But what were they to do? Whether the crew had per-
ished, or were still at sea, tossed about by the wind and the
waves, nothing better could be devised than to unload the
ship of whatever effects could be saved. But how were
they to attempt this, now that their canoe was lost? Finally
Robinson resolved to make a raft, and sending Friday to
the cave to bring provisions, and all the cordage and tools
he could find, he proceeded to cut down trees pro r for a
raft. The two then labored incessantly the remain er of the
day, and completely finished the raft before they slept.

Fortunately, the tide was on the ebb early the next morn-
ing, and they did not delay a moment in launching the raft,
in order to take advantage of the tide to carry them towank a:
the ship, which they safely reached just after day-break; , 9".

What were Robinson's feelings when he approached this
vessel! He would have kissed every part of it, if ible!
That it came from Europe, was built, manned, an guided
thithcabfluropeans, were all circumstances which render-
ed it dear to him. But, alas! these Europeans themselves
had, perhaps, been swallowed up in the waves. Robinson's
first care was to sail around the ship, and examine the depth
of water; but he had the mortification to find that she could
never be floated. Disappointed in his hopes of its preserva-
tion, he hastened on board to examine the cargo, and see if
that was damaged. Friday followed, trembling with fear, for
the first object he saw was that terrible horned monster! It
was no longer fierce as before, but exceedingly weak from
hunger. Robinson made it his first care to find something
for the goat to eat, and then proceeded to examine the cargo
of the ship, which he found in good order. He was now ex-
ceedin ly puzzled to decide what he should take on shore
first. here were a thousand things which in Europe were
of no great value, but which to him were of the utmost im-
portance, and it took him a long time to make up his mind.
At length his choice was fixed on the following : One bar-
rel of gunpowder, one of shot, two muskets, two pair of
pistols, two cutlasses, and two suits of clothes; two dozen
shirts, two hatchets, two axes, two saws, two planes, two
iron bars, some hammers, and several other iron tools; some
books, paper, pens and ink; a hogshead of buiscuit, some
sails, a tinder box, matches and flint; and lastly, the goat.
These were placed on the raft, and the tide now beginning to
flow, they were carried to the island in safety.

Friday was exceedingly curious to know the meaning of
all these things, and their uses. To satisfy his curiosity,
Robinson goes behind a bush, and dressing in a suit of the
clothes, shows himself suddenly to Friday, who starts hack
astonished, not knowing whether it was really his master,
 

or something above the human species. Robinson then gave
Friday a suit of clothes, which he had selected for him, and
showed him how to put them on, and the uses of the various
parts. It was a long time before Friday could manage to
get the clothes on properly. But after putting his legs
through the sleeves of the shirt, and his arms into the legs of
the trowsers, and making a dozen other ridiculous mistakes,
he at length dressed him self correctly. When he saw how well
he was clothed, and how easy and convenient the garments
were, he fairly jum ed about for joy. Robinson also showed
him the use of the 'fi'erent tools, and made him understand
how much more expeditiously they could now accomplish
their work, than before. He then sent him to the cave to
milk the lamas, which had been neglected for two days.

While Friday was gone, Robinson determined to surprise
him with the effects of gunpowder. Accordingly be loaded
one of the muskets, and when Friday returned, he pointed to
a bird in the air, and said, "See that sea-gull ! he shall fall
this moment!" So saying, he leveled his musket and fired.

Friday's terror and surprise were excessive. He fell
down as if he himself had been shot, and it required all Rob-
inson's friendly skill to convince him that there was nothing
in all this but what was perfectly natural and simple. Fri-
day was now inspired with such profound veneration for
Europeans in general, and for his master in particular, that
it was some time before he could recover that familiarity
which had always existed between them.

Robinson had never been happier since his arrival on the
island than he was now; and never was a. man more filled
with gratitude to his Maker. Nor was he content with feel-
ing these sentiments himself; he endeavored to communi-
cate them to Friday,- and therefore taught him a rayer of
thanksgiving, which they both repeated with than ul been
before they went to rest.5%

Risng early the next morning, they first covered all their
goods with boughs of trees. to secure them from rain, and
then, with the first ebb, visited the wreck. This time Rob-
inson selected several pieces of cannon, which he designed
to plant before his habitation, and another barrel of gunpow-
der, with balls and shot. Also, several wheelbarrowsfcssks
of nails and screws, a sail and a grindstone,----all of which
were landed in good order.

For six days they made two or three trips 3 day, and
brought ashore every thing they could Possibly remove.
After they had made sixteen trips, all With good success,
they were visited with a violent storm, which continued
through the whole night. In the morning they saw with
grief, planks and timbers scattered all along the shore--suf-
ficient tokens that the ship had been dashed in pieces.

Gathering all the remains of the wreck together, they now
had more articles than they could put under shelter, and so
resolved to build a store-house or shed, to protect them from
the weather. Being well provided with tools of all kinds,
and with plenty of planks and timbers, it was soon finished.

During these transactions, the goat yeaned two young
ones, so that these animals might now be multiplied on the
island. Friday had by this time so far overcome his fear
of the " horned monster," tlfat he often amused himself by
playing with the old goat. The spaniel served them as a
guard by night, and the parrot amused them by day. In
order to be rfectly hap y, Robinson now wanted filing
but to have his father an mother with him. p '1'

Not many months after this, Friday came running to the
cave one day, in the greatest terror, crying, "Ob, master!
master! one, two, three,--six canoes!" Running hastily to
the top of his rock, Robinson saw at once that his compsne
ion had counted right. There were, indeed, six canoes, full

of savages, just ready to land upon the southern point of the
3.62 LIFE AND auras-roars

 

island. Coming immediately down, he asked Friday, who
had somewhat got over his fright, if he would stand by him
in every danger?

"Yes," answered Friday, " to the last drop of my blood!"
"Then," said Robinson, "we will endeavor to prevent these
monstbrs from executing their horrible designsL" With
these words, he wheeled out one of the large guns, and each
of them putting a brace of pistols in his belt, a cutlass by
his side, and three muskets on his shoulder, they harnessed
themselves to the n carriage, and took the field with stout
hearts, under all t is warlike a paratus.

Arriving, after incredible la r, near the spot where the
savages were, they gained a thicket, from whence they had
a full view of the savages, who were sitting round the fire,
picking the bones of one victim. while another was 1 ing
on the ground, tied hand and foot; probably desi ned or a
similar fate. To Robinson's great surprise and orror, he
discovered this prisoner to be a white man! He could hard]
contain himself; his heart throbbed and his blood boile .
He at once determined to rescue him or perish. Thinking
to frighten the savages, and make them take to flight, he
aimed the cannon so that the ball would ass over their
heads, and applying the match, fired it o . Instantly the
savages all fell down as suddenly as if they had been shot;
but in less than a minute sprung up, and looking about
without discovering any thing, they gathered courage and
began dancing around the fire, at the same time shaking
their weapons in a threatening manner.

Robinson was now undecided what to do ; but observin
the savages soon seat themselves again, after sending two -
their number to despatch the prisoner, he motioned F ' 3
to do as he did. Accordingly they each seized a musket .2
fired, killing three and wounding five. The consternation
of the savages was dreadful. Some ran one way, and some-- ~-- ---~ ~- ---- 'r wvwfiW-rvwwv'

or aoamson causes. 53

WW
anotherfsll yelling in the most frightful manner, while our
heroes each took another musket and fired again, killin
two and wounding several more ; then seizing the two load
musksss, and drawing their cutlasses, they rushed out before
the enemy. Robinson flew to liberate the prisoner, but on
approaching him perceived that some of the savages, having
now discovered their enemy, had rallied and were preparing
for combat. Friday, however, fired at the foremost savage
and killed him on the s t. In the meantime, Robinson cut
the rushes with which t e risoner's hands were tied, asking
him at the 'same time who 0 was. The man answered that
he was aChristian and a Spaniard. Robinson furnished him
with a pistol and a cutlass, that he might assist them against
the savages, while Friday gathered the musketa and loaded
them afresh. The S aniard, the moment he was armed, fell
upon the savages with his cutlass, and d atched two in an
instant. But he was soon hard put to it, or engaging with
a stout savage, he was seized by the middle an thrown on
the ground; just as the savage was in the act of strikin
him dead with a huge war club, Robinson drew a- istol a
shot him through the heart. Mean while Friday ad made
such good use of the loaded muskets and his cutlass, that
the few savages who were not killed tool: to their canoes
with all possible haste, and the battle was ended.

0n examining one of the two canoes left by the savages,
Robinson discovered to his great aux-511i" anothefjs'uoner,
---an Indium--tied hand and foot, as e Spaniard had'been.
Cutting the cords. and lifting him up, he called Friday, who'
was burying the dead bodies, to speak to him in his native
language. Scarcely had Frida cast 6 es on the risoner,
'hsnhe flewto him,embraeed im,loc edhimin ' ' , --
cried, laughed, danced, and acted altogether like a man out
ofh'u senses. It was sometime before his astonished mates
could draw from him this short answer, " It is my father!"
It would be difficult to describe all the marks ofifilial love
which this excellent young man showed upon this occasion.
Twenty times he jumped out of the canoe upon land, and
from the land into the canoe again. Sometimes he Qened
his jacket and pressed his father's head to his bosom, to warm
it; at other times he rubbed the joints of his arms and legs,
where they had been so tightly bound; and now he embraced
him again and again, and covered him with kisses.

Robinson having helped the Spaniard, who was nearly ex-
hausted, into the same canoe with Friday's father, now put
all his arms, together with those of the conquered Indians,
into the other, making it fast to the first, which he entered.
With Friday's assistance, he soon paddled round to the beach
opposite their cave, to which they immediately conveyed the
two disabled men, laying them on their own beds, that they
miO'ht get some repose while their hosts prepared supper.

fn the course of the conversation which ensued during this
meal, it appeared that the Spaniard belonged to the ship
which was lost, and that he and the rest of the crew had, by
means of the boats, gained one of the neighboring islands,
where they were kindly treated.

" Some days ago," said he, " the island where we landed
was invaded by a tribe of hostile savages. Every one took
up arms, and we should have thought ourselves wanting in
gratitude, if we had not readily assisted a people who had
been so kind to us. I fought by the side of this brave old
man, who, like an enraged lion, threw himself into the hottest
of the combat. I saw him surrounded by his enemies, and
would have rescued him, but was myself taken risouer with
him. In this dreadful captivity we passed two days and two
nights, hound hand and foot, and were this morning brought
here to he devoured! Providence sent you, generous men,
to our assistance; you rescued us, and we owe you a debt
of gratitude which we can only repay with our lives."
 

Robinson then took the Spaniard to his cellar and store-
house, and showed him the efi'ects which had been saved
from the shi . Night approachin , all parties retired to
bed earlier an usual, to seek re reshment in sleep after
the great excitements and labors of this eventful day.

The next morning Robinson spoke of getting the Spanish
crew over from the neighboring island, in order that they
might share the comforts which he had collected round him.
The Spaniard ofl'ered to go for them, in one of the canoes
which they had taken from the savages; and Friday's father,
whom Robinson now called " Thursday," volunteered to go
with him. Accordingly, it was at once settled that they
should set sail as soon as all four had planted a field at least
ten times larger than Robihson had cultivated before; be-
cause the increase of the colony would necessarily require
an increased supply of food. With this view, they all set to
work, and at the end of a fortnight had finished their farm-
ing, so that the two envoys could depart on their mission.
This they did the first fair wind, after taking an afl'ectionate
leave of Robinson and Friday. The latter was so affected
at the separation from his father, that he shed tears contin-
ually for several days after their departure.

A week had now elapsed, and their return was daily ex-
pected, when Friday, who was constantly on the look-out,
rushed into the cave, singing, and bawling like a madman,
"they're coming! they're coming!"

At these agreeable tidings, Robinson hastened to the top
of the rock, from whence he erceived at a distance, a boat
making towards the island. lint the joy in his countenance
soon disappeared, and he said to Friday, " Theseus not the
people we ex ted. It is an English boat, with'English
sailors in it. ollow me," continued he, taking the path to
a distant eminence, from which they could see the northern
coast. Scarcely had they reached it, when they were struck
 

 

motionless with astonishment. At the distance of about two
miles there was an English ship lying at anchor.

Surprise, fear, and joy, seized Robinson by turns; joy at
the sight of a ship which might carry him to his own coun-
try, and fear because he apprehended these men might be
pirates. He resolved to act with great caution. To have
an eye upon whatever passed, he and Friday posted them-
selves u on a rising ground, covered with trees and under-
wood. rom this place they saw the boat, with eleven men
in it, land at a short distance from them. Eight of the men
were armed, and the other three tied hand and foot; these
were unbound as soon as landed. By .the countenance and
actions of one of them, in particular, he appeared to be soli-
citing the compassion of those who were armed. The other
two now and then lifted up their hands towards Heaven, as
if to implore succor and deliverance.

It was not without shuddering, that Robinson saw some of
the armed wretches lift up their hangers over the head of him
who was on his knees before them. He determined at once,
to risk every thing for the preservation of the three men, if
they should prove deserving. With this resolution, he sent
Friday to the cave to bring a load of arms and ammunition,
while heremained to observe what passed. The prisoners
were soon left alone, and sat down with sorrowful and des-
ponding countenances, while the sailors dispersed themselves
about the woods. By the time Friday returned, they were
most of them laid down in the shade, here and there, to sleep
during the violent heat of the noon-day. Waiting for them
to get sound asleep, and then approaching the prisoners, who
were sitting with their backs towards him, Robinson called
out suddenly, "Who are you '2" They were thunderstruck,
and started up to run away; but he bade them fear nothing
for he had come to assist them. " You are then sent fi'om
Heaven," said one of them, surveying him with the greatest
 

astonishment. " All assistance comes from Heaven," re-
plied Robinson; " but not to lose time, tell me in what con-
sists our distress, and how I can relieve you."

" am captain of that ship," said one of them. " and this,"
pointing to his companions, " was my mate, and that gentle-
man a passenger. My sailors mutinicd and seized the ship;
their intention at first was to kill us; at last, however, they
agreed to spare our lives; but having determined to leave
us on this island, we are sure to erish miserab y."

" On two conditions," replied globinson, "I will risk my
life to relieve you from this extremity."

" Generous man! let us know what they are '1" said he.

" They are these: you shall, in all things, conform to my
will, and if I recover for you possession of the ship, you shall
give me and my com anion a free passage to England."

" We, the ship, an all that it contains, shall be wholly at
your dispose ," answered the captain.

" Very well," said Robinson, "I will now 've you arms.
Your enemies are asleep, and dispersed one tom the other.
Come, let us master them without spilling their blood."

They set forward, Friday carrying the cords which had
been taken 05' the prisoners. The first sailor they came to
slept so soundly that they seized him and crammed a hand-
kerchief into his mouth before he was well awake. Tying
his hands and feet, they commanded him to make no noise,
on pain of instant death. The second met the same fate.
Providence appeared on this occasion the protector of the
innocent--six of the villains bein bound without dificulty.
The two last started up and seize their arms. "Villains!"
cried Robinson, "see where your comrades lie! surrender
this instant; the least delay may cost you your lives!"

>> They threw down their arms, and falling on their knees,
entreated the captain's pardon. Being instantly bound, like
the test, all of them were removed to a cavern and confined.

"M"... w .---

They were then informed that the guard having charge of
them would shoot the first man who attempted to escape.

Robinson, with his new friends, now drew the boat up on
beach and bored holes in its bottom, foreseeing that if it did
not return, the people on board would send another; and
they chose to prevent their taking back the first. This hap-
pened just as they expected. About four o'clock, three guns
were fired from the ship, and the signal not being obeyed,
another boat put off towards the island. Having landed, the
crew, ten in number and well armed, jumped out and ran to
the first boat, which they were much surprised to see drawn
up on land, and holes bored in its bottom. They looked around,
calling their comrades by name; but no one answered.

Robinson was now informed, that among the prisoners in
the cave were three who from fear alone had joined in the
mutiny, and he. sent Friday and the mate for them imme-
diately. Dn their appearance, the captain, after reproach-
ing them for their behavior, asked them whether, if he
should pardon them, they would be faithful for the future?
" To the last moment of our lives," was their reply. "Be-
fore this mutiny," continued the captain, " I took you to be
honest men, and am still willing to believe you were forced
to take a part in it. I hope you will make amends for the
past, by being faithful and steady in future." The three
sailors, heartily repenting their crime, shed tears of joy on
being forgiven, and the captain, giving them arms, ordered
them to be obedient to their common chief.

Friday and one of the sailors were now directed to go
into the thickets, and when a good distance from the boat,
answer the call of the last comers; then they were to go
farther, by degrees, answering occasionally, so as to draw
the mutineers as far from the beach as possible. This strat-
agem suc'ceeded completely. The mutineers hearing a voice
in answer to their calls, ran eagerly towards the quarter from
 

whence it roceeded, leaving two of their number to guard
the boat. riday and his companion, after leading them a
long chase, returned by a circuitous route to join Robinson.
By this time ni ht was a preaching, and it grew by de-
grees darker and arker. flobinson and his party now ad-
vanced silentl towards the boat, till within a few yards of it,
when they su denly showed themselves, and threatened the
two men with instant death if they dared to stir. Stupified
with astonishment, they begged for quarter, and were im-
mediately bound and led away. Robinson and his party
then drew the boat some ways from the beach, and con-
concealing themselves behind a clump of bushes, awaited the
return of the eight mutineers. Five of them soon appeared,
apparently much fatigued, and were extremely astonished
at not finding the boat. \Vhile they were consulting about
it, Robinson sent one of the pardoned sailors to order them
to lay down their arms in a moment; he was to inform them
that the governor of the island had seized their boats and
made their companions prisoners, so ther ewas no choice left
them but to surrender. At the same time, Robinson's patty
made a great clattering of arms, in order to intimidate them.
" Can we hope for pardon 'l" asked one. The ca tain
answered, " Thomas Smith, you know my voice ; lay own
.your arms and you shall all beaspared except Atkin." This
Atkin was the princigal tingle er of the mutiny. Th all
immediately threw own their arms, and were boun , as
their companions had been. Atkin entreated the captain's
mercy, urging that he was not more guilty than the others.
The captain answered that he could only intercede for him
with the governor of the island. The other three mutineers
new returning, were informed of what had sssed, and seeing
the folly of resistance, submitted to be ti with;the rest.
Robinson then informed them, that their crime'being mu-
tiny, they weak: as pardoned only on condition of their as-
 

 

sisting the captain to recover possession of his ship. They
protested they would do this with cheerfulness an fidelity.

The ship's carpenter now sto ped the holes in the first
boat, and both were immediately liiunched; the captain took
command of one, the mate of the other, and the repentant
sailors were equally divided between them. Havin been
provided with arms, they pulled for the ship, leaving obin-
son and Friday to guard the mutineers in the cavern.

The expedition was quite successful. After a few hours
absence, the captain returned and informed Robinson how
he became master of the ship without striking a blow. The
night being quite dark he was not seen, and had no difficulty
in getting on board with the others. The few men in the
ship, finding how matters stood, gave up at once, and were
glad to be permitted to return to their duty.

When the captain had finished this recital, he added, with
tears in his eyes, " It is you, generous man, who have saved
me, and restored my ship. It is now yours; you shall dis.
pose of that and me as you please."

Robinson then related his strange adventures, which ex-
cited the captain's highest curiosity and admiration. He
entreated Robinson to tell him what to do for him. " Be-
sides what I stipulated yesterday," he replied, "I wish you
to wait the return of the Spaniards, and land them, if they,
wish, in Cadiz. And I beg you will punish the mutineers
in no other way than by leaving them on this island."'

To this the captain consented. Sending for the prison-
ers, he picked out the most guilty, and told them their sen-
tence, which they heard with great satisfaction, knowing
that by law they were liable to be put to death. Robinson
at the same time entreated them to repent of their wickalyfi
ness, to agree together, and to be industrious; assuring that.
that the practice of virtue could alone render their situatioi
agreeable. He was still speaking, when Friday brought\ y ' -7--:~ "w" "7""

news of the arrival of his father and the Spaniards, who
were at that moment landing.

Robinson saw with surprize, among those who came
in the canoe, two females. He soon learned they were
natives whom two of the Spaniards had married, and who
understandin that some sailors were to he left on the isl-
and, at once etermined to remain there with their wives.

Robinson was glad to hear this. He hoped that these two
men, whose characters were excellent, would influence the
mutineers to lead regular and virtuous lives. He therefore
gave them possession of his little fortress, and of the arms,
ammunition, and tools; these the were to lend the others
when they needed them, provid they were peaceable and
friendly. Then exhorting them all, once more, to cultivate
unanimity, industrious habits, and above all, dependence on
God, he bade them an affectionate farewell.

Sending on board of the ship his dress of skins, umbrella,
stone hatchet, spear, bow and arrows, the parrot and spaniel,
and lastl , his lump of old, Robinson embarked, accompa-
nied by hursday and riday. Having a fair wind and fine
weather, they in four weeks arrived safely at Cadiz, where
they landed the Spaniards. Setting sail from Cadiz, they
soon reached Portsmouth without accident. Here Robinson
found asmall vessel going to Plymouth immediately. He
therefore took an affectionate leave of his kind captain, and
with his two companions, embarked at once. Arrivin safely
at Plymouth, he took a coach for his native city, xeter.
He had already heard at Portsmouth of his mother's death,
and he bitterly lamented his loss.

Stopping at the Easter inn, Robinson sent a messenger to
were his father, h degrees, for his unexpected return.

man was char to tell the old gentleman, at first, that
a stranger had arrived in the city, with news about his, lost
son. Then how to add,that this strangerupectedh'n
 

 

son would soon return home. And finally, he was to inform
him that the stranger who brought these glad tidings was
Robinson himself. Without this preparation the sudden joy
might have endangered the old gentleman's life.

After this recaution, Robinson flew to the house, and in
a transport 0 inexpressible ecstacy, threw himself into the
arms 0 his father, who trembled all over. " Oh! my fath-
er!" " My dear son !" was all they could say. Trembling
and speechless, they remained for some time locked in each
other's arms; at length a flood of tears relieved their breasts,
which were almost suffocated with joy.

Friday and Thursday, whom the ten thousand new objects
which they saw filled with astonishment, stared about them
in silence, for many days. They were so dazzled and con-
founded that it waslong before they could take a rational
view of the advantages of civilized over sava e life.

Robinson Crusoe's return, and the story 0 his s rising
adventures, soon spread through the city. He was t e sole
subject of conversation, and every body crowded to see
him. His father's house was daily filled with people; and
he was constantly employed in relatin his sto ; in the
course of which he always exhorted the athers an mothers
.who heard him, to teach their children, in their early years,
to be obedient, godly, temperate, and industrious. And to
the oung he often gave this wholesome advice:

" y dear children, always obey your parents and your
teachers; study diligently to store your minds with useful
knowledge; cherish virtuous thoughts and habits; love and
fear God; and be careful,--oh! he very careful to avoid
