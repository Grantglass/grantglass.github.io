HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURES.

ROBINSON CRUSOE was the
third son of a rich merchant who
, lived in the city of York. His father
' wished him to be a lawyer when he grew
; up, but the boy had a great longing to go
to sea, and could think of nothing but
sailing to strange countries, and seeing
wonderful things. This wish of his made
his parents very sad; and one day his
father, who was kept in his room by the gout, sent for Crusoe, and told
him how much he grieved his parents by this wish, and reproved him
for his desire to go wandering idly over the world. " Crusoe ought," the
old gentleman said, "to stay at home and work honestly, and try to be a.
comfort to his mother and father; if he disobeyed them God would not
bless him, and he would have great sorrow." The poor man shed tears as
he spoke, and Crusoe felt very sorry, and said that he would stay at home
and obey his father. But this good resolution did not last; for being a
year afterwards at the town of Hull, where there were ships, he met one
of his idle companions, who invited him to go on board his father's vessel
with him, and then persuaded Crusoe to sail with them to London, telling
him that it should be no expense to him, and that it would be a very
pleasant trip. Crusoe, thus tempted, forgot his promise, and without
asking his father's leave, or even letting him know where he was gone, he
sailed away with his bad companion.
But the ship had no sooner got out of the Plumber--the river on
which l-lull stands,---than the wind began to blow very hard, and the
waves to rise in a frightful manner. Crusoe had never seen the sea
before, so he was dreadfully frightened, and very sea-sick. He felt then
how wrong and wicked he had been, and was very sorry. He thought
every moment that the great waves would swallow up the ship tossed on
them; but the next day the wind went down; Crusoe was quite well, and
he thought the smooth blue sea with the sun shining on it was the finest
sight he had ever seen. On the sixth day they reached Yarmouth
Roads, having been detained on their way there by a calm, and a wind
that blew against them. Here they anchored, and remained for eight
days, the wind being still contrary.

And then arose another dreadful storm. Though the ship was at
anchor, the master thought that nothing could save her from driving and
being lost. They cut away the masts; but in the middle of the night
one of the men who had been sent down to see, came up and told the
master that the vessel had sprung a leak, and that there were four feet of
water in the hold. Crusoe was lying on his bed, but they called him to
help pump out the sea, and he had to obey them, and work very hard.
Then finding that the ship must sink, the master fired 03' a gun every
minute to call for help. Another vessel, just ahead, sent a boat to them,
though it was very dangerous to do so, and the brave men in her had
great trouble to get alongside the ship. But they managed to pull her
under the stem, and the master, the crew, and Crusoe got into her. The
sailors could not, however, row back to their own ship, and had to try and
reach the shore. Before they did so----indeed, when Crusoe had been
only a quarter of an hour out of the ship--she went down.

At last, with great difliculty, the boat was brought to the shore, where
a number of ready hands were waiting to pull her up on the beach.
From the place they landed at the shipwrecked men had to walk back
to Yarmouth. Here the people were very kind to them, and gave them
food, clothes, and money to take them home or to London. If Crusoe
had gone back to his father then he would have been forgiven, and might
have lived happily; but he did not. He went to London. \Vhile there
he became friends with the captain of a merchant vessel who was
going soon to sail to the coast of
Africa, or Guinea, and who asked
Crusoe to go with him. His first
shipwreck had not cured the lad of
his love of the sea. He consented to
make this voyage; but it is pleasant
to learn that hc let his parents knew
that he was alive, and that his
father and other friends gave him
some money to buy toys and beads,
with which he might trade with the
negroes of Guinea. This voyage
was a very successful one. \\-'ith
forty pounds worth of toys, &<:.,

Crusoe gained three hundred
pounds worth of gold dust, and brought it home quite safely; Soon

after they landed his good friend the captain died. However, he
had taught Crusoe a great deal about the way to manage a ship,
and the lad thought that he would like to make another voyage to
Guinea. Now the mate who had sailed with the captain the last time
had succeeded him in the command of the ship, and Crusoe offered to
go with him. But he left two hundred pounds of his money with the
captain's widow, begging her to take care of it for him; and only spent
one hundred of it in toys and trifles to trade with the ncgrues. This
proved a very unhappy voyage; for as they 'were sailing between the
 

 

 

Canary Islands and the African Coast they saw, in the grey of the
morning, a vessel which they knew was a Turkish rover from Sallee. A
rover was a set -rol)ber,~ or pirate, from the coast of Barbary, and merchant.
ships were very much afraid of these vessels, for they fought very fiercely,
and if they took the ship, they not only robbed the captain and crew of all
their property, but carried them ashore and sold them for slaves. Crusoc's-
ship crowded on all the sails she had, but she could not sail as fast as the
pirate, and at last she had to fire her guns. But the pirates got on board
her, and though the crew fought bravely, the ship was taken, and Crusoe,
the captain, and the crew were all made prisoners and carried to Sallee,
a. town belonging to the Moors. Here they were all sold as slaves and
sent up the country, except Crusoe; the captain had taken a liking to
him, and kept him as his own share of the prize. And now Crusoe
began to feel the truth of what his father had said to him that God would
punish a disobedient son. He was only a poor slave, with a chain round
his ankle, and compelled to toil in the sun for his master. Every day,
looking over the sea, he longed to be free, and was always thinking how
he could escape.
But for two years there was no chance of his doing- so. At last the
- pirate, not being able to get money enough to fit out his ship, used once
or twice a week to go out fishing in the pinnace (a large boat), and always
took with him a little Moorish boy and Crusoe to help him row. Crusoe
caught fish so well that sometimes his master would send him out in the
boat with one of hisown relations and the boy to get fish for dinner.
One day while they were out a fog came on; they lost sight of the shore,
and alter rowing about all night, they found themselves in the morning a
long way out at sea. It was very late the next day belbre they reached
the land, and as they had nothing to eat, they were very hungry. Crusoe's
master was quite frightened at this accident, and in case it should happen
to himself, he had the long- boat of the English ship that he had takenPIRATE

fitted with a little cabin, with a table, and places to hold wine and provisions,
and he also put a compass on board.

In this boat Crusoe managed to make his escape, first putting on
board her, secretly, some food and water, some powder and shot. Then
the next time he went out with only the Moor and the boy Xury he
took the man by surprise, seized him suddenly, and threw him overboard.
Crusoe knew that he could swim, and would not be drowned, so he
would not let him come on board again; he threatened to shoot him if
he did. And then the Moor swam towards the land. Crusoe turned to
the boy and asked him if he would be faithful to him; if not, he said he
must throw him overboard also. But XuIy smiled, and promised that
he would be true, and they sailed on together. They steered along the
north-west coast of Africa very close to the shore, but they Were afraid to
land as the country seemed full of \xild beasts; the howling of these
animals at night being dr.eadful At last their Jars of w ater w eIe empty,
and they were obliged to land to get them filled. Xury oFfered to go
alone. Crusoe said, " But why should you do, and I stay in the boat. -' '

The boy said, affectionately, "If uilcl mans come they eat me; you
go way." "Well, Xury,' ans" ered Crusoe "wcwill both go, and if the
wild mans come we will kill them; they shall not eat either of us."

So they hauled the boat into the shore, and waded to the beach.
But they did not see any wild men
or beasts. XuIy shot a hare, and
they made a fire and roasted it; and
as there was plenty of fresh water
close by they filled their jars, and
when they had eaten their dinner they
went back to the boat. They had to lanl often to get water, and one
morning, as they were sailing In to go on shore, Xury came to Crusoe
and said,I : ROSINSON CR (/8055.

" There is a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep."

Crusoe looked where he pointed, and saw that it "as a great and
terrible lion that lay on the side of the shore.

" Xur) r " he said, "you shall go on shore and kill him."

Xury 01%de frightened, and said, " Me kill! He eat me at one

1 mouth!" One mouthful he meant.
' Crusoe said no more to the boy, but
- took two guns and loaded them; then he
fired at- the lion and wounded him in the
leg. The creature rose on three legs and
gave a dreadful roar; but Crusoe fired again
- and hit him in the head, and killed him.

Not long after this adventure they were

, seen and picked up by a Portuguese ship,

and the captain of it took them to the
' Brazils. Here Crusoe was tempted to buy
a plantation, to pay for which he wrote to
, his friend the widow for his two hundred
pounds. Thus he became a sugar planter,
and was making money; but his old rest-
lessness soon returned, and when the other
planters asked him to go to Guinea for them, to bring back slaves to work
in their plantations, he at once agreed to go.

But again Crusoe was to find how dangerous the sea is. A dreadful
hurricane came on, and the ship was blown quite out of her right course,
and no one on board her knew where she had drifted. When the
storm ceased they found that she was leaky, and the captain then thought
that they had better go back to Brazil. But Crusoe was against it, and
looking over the charts with him, persuaded him to steer to some of the
English \V est India Islands. However, a second storm overtook them;
they Were carried away by it still further westward, quiteout of the way
of ships, and towards the lands of savages. In this distress, the wind
blowing very hard, one of the men early in the morning cried out,
" Land," and the Captain and Crusoe no
sooner ran on deck than the ship struck on
a sandbank. The great waves dashed over
her, and as the sailors expected every minute
that she would break to pieces, the male and
the rest of the men got out the only boat
they had left and slung it over the side.
They all got into it, and pushed off from >>
the ship. But a great wave came rolling aStcm, and at once oversct
it. Crusoe was caught by the wave and carried by it to the land. Here,
however, before he could escape it, another wave came over him, dashing
him against a rock, but still carrying him onwards. H e seized a point of

-- rack, to which he clung
desperately, and held it
till the wave abated;
then, running as fast as
possible, he gained the
shore, and sitting down
to rest, thanked God for
sparing his life. Not
one soul had been saved
but himself, and he
thought sorrowfully of
his lost shipmates as he
sat alone looking out at
the stranded vessel, that he could still see on the sand where it had
struck. Night had come on, and as he thought of how entirely alone he
 

was, dripping wet, and with nothing about him but a knife, a tobacco
pipe, and a little tobacco in a box, he began to dread that he had only
escaped from the sea to die on the land. He was now very thirsty, so
he walked nearlv a mile inland to see if he could find any fresh water.
. Happily he discovered a rill, and having
.2 drunk, and put a little tobacco in his mouth
' to prevent hunger, he sought for a tree in
which he could pass the night, for he
V feared that there might be ravenous beasts
in that country, who in the darkness would
be seeking for their prey, and might devour
him.

He found a thick high tree, and, first
cutting himself a short stick like a truncheon
to defend himself with, he climbed up into
- it, seated himself between the branches,
and was soon fast asleep, for he was wom
out by fatigue and sorrow.

\V hen Crusoe awoke it was broad
day, the sky clear, and the wind nearly
gone; and he was much surprised to see that the ship had been
lifted off the sand where she lay by the rising tide, and had been driven
almost as: near shore as the rock against which he had been cast. This-
was about a mile from the land. The ship was standing quite upright.
He wished that he were on board that he might get some things necessary
for his use. When he came down from the tree the first thing he saw
was the boat, which the wind and the sea had tossed up upon the land
about two miles on the right hand, but separated from Crusoe byan inlet
of the sea, so that he could not reach her. His chief wish, however, now
was to get on board the ship to obtain food and clothes. A little after"NRECK.

noon the tide ehhed, and he found that he could walk to \1 1th1n a quarler

swam to the ship, but it
was difficult to get on heard,

found that the ship had a great deal of water
in her hold, but that as she lay on the side of
a sandbank all her quarter was free of the sea,
and everything there was dry. The provisions-
were not touched by the water, and he began
to think how he could get them on shore. In
order to do so. he flung some spare yards and
spares of wood overboard. tying each by a rope
that it might not get away. Then going down
the ship's side, he made of them (with the
addition of a spare topmast) :1 raft, which he
loaded by degrees with all the articles that
he thought would he most useful to him ;.

powder and shot. These stores he carried down to his raft, which was
at last fully laden. lle guided it with an ear, and at last managed to
get it to the shore ; there he fastened it by sticking two broken oars into
the earth and tying it to them.

His next work was to examine the country, and find a place to live
in, and to store his goods. There was a hill about a mile away that
was very steep and high. Crusoe took a gun and a pistol (he had
found two), and thus armed, travelled to it and he climbed it .
with great labour and difficult}!. When he reached
the top he could see fora great distance, and he
found that the country he was in had water all round
it, so you know it was an island. He could not see
any houses or huts, therefore he thought he must be
on a desert land with nothing but wild beasts on it ;
but in this last belief he was mistaken; there were
none. Afar off across the sea he saw two other small
islands. As he returned he shot :t great bird,
sitting on a tree at the side of a Wood. The
moment he fired a great number of birds of all
kinds, making a great noise of screaming, rose up
into theair, but Crusoe (lid not know the name of
any one of them. He went back to the raft and
spent all the rest of the (lay in getting his stores on shore.

Afraid that another storm might come on and break the ship to
pieces, Crusoe swam out to her again the next day. Once more on
board the wreck, he made a second but rather smaller raft; on it he
brought on shore many useful things: two or three bags full of nails and
spikes, a great SCI'C\\'~j::l(:l(, a dozen or two of hatchets, and that
most useful thing, a grindstone, to sharpen them on, Then he
found seven mnskets, a bag of small shot, several fiiwling pieces,
 

 

 

and two barrels of musket bullets. Besides these he took all the men's-
elothes he could find, a spare foretopsuil, a hammock, and some bedding.

As soon as he had brought the second raft to the shore, Crusoe set
to work to make a little tent with the sail and some poles which he cut
for that purpose, and into this tent he brought everything that would
spoil with rain or sun. Then he piled all the empty chests and casks up
in a circle round the tent, to protect it from any attack by wild beasts.
Vt'hen he had done this he blocked up the door with some boards
within, and an empty chest set up on end without, and spreading
one of the beds on the ground, laying his
two pistols just at his head, and his gun
at his side, he went to bed for the first
time on the island, and slept very quietly
all night, for he was very tired.

Crusoe thought it best to go every day
to the wreck, to bring away with him
whatever he could, such as small ropes,
twine, spare .cunvas, and barrels of gun-
powder. After six voyages he still found
another barrel of biscuits--a great hogs- _
head of them--a box of sugar, :1 barrel of flour, and three runlCtS
of rum. He brought on shore also some pieces of the great cable.
which he had broken up. He had been eleven times to the ship,
when one day he found a locker with drawers in it, in one of which
he saw two or three razors, a dozen knives and forks, and in another
about thirty-six pounds in coins of (liFlerent countries. He smiled at
the sight of this money.

"Oh! drug," said he, "thou art not worth taking. One of these
knives is worth all this heap. Remain where thou art."
But on second thoughts he took it, and, wrapping it in a piece of
 

canvas, began to think of making another raft, but suddenly the sky
beemne overcast, and the wind began to rise. Crusoe thought that he
had better get back to the shore at once, therefore he swam across the
.- $35 t . : channel, though with difiiculty,' on
gm. , _ account of the weight of the things
" ' ' - ' he carried. and the roughness of the
sea, but he reached his little tent
safely. It blew very hard that night,
and when Crusoe looked out in the
morning the ship was no longer to
be seen. He was glad then that he
had been able to bring away so much before the wreck was washed away.
Crusoe now began to think of making a dwelling for himself, and a
place to keep his property in. He found a little plain on the side of a
rising hill, which was very steep, so that nothing could come down
upon him from the top. On the surface of this rock was a hollow place,
worn at little way in, but not quite a cave. Just before this hollow place
he pitched his tent. He made, however, half a circle first before it, and
put round it strong stakes or pillars of wood, as high as a tall man, with
their points sharpened. Then he put in another row of stakes, and
between the two he laid the pieces of the ship's cable; a third row of
posts followed, and made so strong a wall that neither man nor beast
could get over it. It had no door. Crusoe made a ladder, by
which he could go over the top and draw the ladder up when he
was inside.

Into this strong place Crusoe took all his provisions, his gunpowder and
shot. Then he. put up one small tent and another larger one over it
close. by the fortress, covering the large tent with an oiled cloth called
tarpaulin that he had brought from the wreck, to keep out the rain, which
falls very heavily in hot countries. A storm of thunder and lightning3L. 4

happened just then, and he was so afraid of the lightning touching his
gunpowder and blowing it up, that he divided it about in boxes and
bags, and put it in different places. W'hilst he was making his tree wall,
he went out once every day with his gun to see if he could kill anything
fit for food. He soon found that there were wild goats in the island, but
they were so shy that he could never shoot them on the plain. How-
ever, he observed that when he was on the hills they took no notice of
him ; therefore he climbed the rock, and then firing down on them, killed
one that had a kid by her side. Crusoe was sorry for that, and as the
kid followed its dead mother, he took it in his arms and lifted it over his '
enclosure. But it would not eat, and he was obliged to kill it. W'e
must not forget to mention that Crusoe took two cats from the ship
with him; a dog, also on board, jumped
out of the ship himself and swam
on shore to Crusoe. He proved a
very faithful servant and friend to the ,
shipwrecked man, and was as good as a '
companion, though a dumb one. Crusoe
also brought from the wreck, paper, pens,
ink, mathematical instruments, dials, and
telescopes. In his own cargo he had also
found three very good Bibles, which he
brought on shore.

It was, by Crusoe's account, the 30th of
September when he first set foot in this
island. 'When he had been there ten or

and nailed it on a long- post as a cross. He set it up on the shore where
he landed. Upon the sides of this square post he cut every day a notch
with a knife. Every seventh notch he cut as long again as the week-
day ones, and every first day of the month as long again as that long
seventh one- , and thus he kept his reckoning of time

steady light like a candle. 1n the midst of my-labours.it happened
that, rummaging my things, 1 found a little bag, which had been
filled with corn for the feeding of poultry. The little remainder
of seeds that had been in the bag was all devoured by the rats,
and I saw nothing in it but husks and dust, and being willing to have
the bag for some other use (I think it was to put- powder in when I
divided it for fear of the lightning) I shook the husks of corn out of it on
one side of my fortifications under the rock. It was a little before the
great rains that I threw this stuff away; when about a month after I saw
some few stalks of something green shooting
' out of the ground, which I fancied might
be some plant I had not seen; but I was
perfectly astonished when, after a little
longer time, I saw about ten or twelve cars
come out, which were perfectly green barley,
of the same kind as our English barley.

" It is impossible to describe the as-
tonishment and confusion of my thoughts
on this occasion. I had very few notions of .
religion in my head, but after 1 saw barley
grow there, in a climate which I knew was
not proper for corn, and as I knew not how
it came there, I began to think that God
had miraculously caused His grain to grow
for my food in this wild, miserable place.
This touched my' heart, and brought tears to my eyes. It really was
the work of Providence to me which had ordered that ten or twelve
grains of com should remain unspoiled, and that I should throw it
on that particular place, where, being in the shade of a high rock, it
sprang up at once. I carefully saved the ears of this com, you may:6 ROBINS 013' CR (/5013.

be sure, in their season, and laying,r up every corn, resolved to sow them
all again."

Crusoe was surprised in April by a shock of earthquake, which very
much frightened him, and made him resolve to move his tent from under
the overhanging rock for fear it should fall and crush him. He thought
that he would build a wall in a circle as before, and set his tent in it.
The next morning he began to think of the means to be used to make
this new fence. Ilis tools had grown very blunt,
and were full of notches, and though he had a grind-
. stone, as'you may recollect, he could not turn it and
_ grind his tools also. At length he contrived a wheel
_ with a string, to turn it with his foot, so that he
could use both hands, and thus he managed to
grind all his tools.

Meantime Crusoe had hollowed out the place in
the rock with an iron pick, and had made it his
store-house. The earthquake threw pieces of the
wreck on shore, and Crusoe worked at getting planks from it. One
day he was so happy as to find a turtle or tortoise on the beach. He
cooked it the next day, and Found it very nice food; he had grown tired
of eating nothing but goats and birds. In June he was taken very ill
with a disease called ague. On June 27th he wrote in his journal :--
" The aguc again so violent that I lay a-bed all day, and neither ate
nor drank. I was ready to perish for thirst, but so weak I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink. Frayed to
God, but was light-headed, and when 1 was not I was so ignorant that I
knew not what to say; only I lay, and cried ' Lord, look on me! Lord,
pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me !' I suppose I did nothing else
for two or three hours, till the lit wearing off, I l'ell asleep, and did not
wake till far in the night."
 

 

"June 28th.--Having been refreshed by the sleep I had l1PS1(.l,m'|d

would return the next day, and now was my time to get something to
refresh and support me when I should be ill ; and the first thing I did 1
filled a large, square case-bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in
reach of my bed; and to take off the chill of the water I put about
a quarter of a pint of rum into it and mixed them together. Then I got

Crusoe felt then how near God is to all of us, and how good lle
is; and that night, before he lay down to sleep, he did what he had
never done before--he kneeled clown and prayed to God to keep l-Iis
promise and hear him in his trouble. After his prayer he drank the
rum, in which he had put some tobacco. It was very nasty, but it made
him sleep till three o'clock the next day, and then

By the 3rd of July the ague was gone; but he
was very weak still. He thanked God for making
him well again, and then he began reading the
Bible every morning and every night, and he soon
found that it made him very happy, and he was
no longer so lonely, for now he knew that God
was ever near him, and ready to hear his prayer.

As soon as Crusoe was well enough, he made
up his mind to walk as far as he could over the
island. He found that there were many pleasant
meadows in it, that tobacco grew there, and many
other plants whose names he did not know. By-
and-bye, as he went further on, he came to woods
and fruit trees. He found also melons growing
on the ground in great quantities, and amongst the

great trees fine grape-vines had grown and twined round their branches;
he saw the sweet purple and green grapes hanging from them. He found
also orange trees, lemons, and citrons.

He managed to dry the grapes in the

hot sun, then theybccame raisins, which
he laid by to use in the rainy season;
lemons and limes would keep also, to
be eaten when the rains kept him in
his tent. In this lovely place Crusoe
built himself a bower, making a
double hedge round it to keep it safe,
. and he called it his country house. He
was much surprised, about this time,
by an increase to his family. One of
his cats had run away and been lost,
but about the end of August she came
back and brought three kittenswith her.

In the rainy season Crusoe em~
ploycd himself at home making useful
things. I: or example, he wanted a
bask-ct, and as he. found some nice
twigs near his country house, he cut
them down, and with them made some ex-
cellent baskets, while the dog and pussy
looked on.

It was very lucky that when he was a
boy he had taken great delight in standing
at a basket-
maker's shop,
and watching
him make

articles; and
being, as boys generally are, glad to help, he
had thus learned -a most useful art. He
next resolved to make some clay pots. He
took some clay, moistened it, and Worked
it into shape with his hands. Then he made
-a fire of wood and put all round them. He
kept adding sticks to the fire till he saw that
the pots were red-hot all through. He had
to watch them carefully for fear the sand that3deg . fiOB/zVS'Orv CR (130112

he had mixed with the clay should run into glass, and he succeeded very
well ; he had at last made three pipkins and two
jars that would stand fire, and one was glazed,
or shiny, from the sand running. He was so
pleased when he could hang his great pot over
the fire he made, and boil his goat's meat
instead of roasting it. Crusoe had caught a
parrot when he was on one of his journeys,
and this bird gave him a great pleasure.

W'hen Crusoe had been nearly seven years
on the island, his clothes, and all those that he
had brought on shore, were quite worn to rags.
So now he had to make a suit for himself.
He had saved the skins of all the animals he
had killed, and had dried them in the sun. _
Of these he now made himself a suit of i
clothes. He made first a great cap to l
keep his head from the sun; next a
jacket and trousers. He had before man-
aged to make for himself a large umbrella.

But his most difficult task was the
building of a boat. He did build a
large one, but had then no power of moving
her, and she was of no use. Aften'ards he
cut down a tree much nearer the shore,
and succeeded, by his patience and hard
work, in building a nice little boat there.
He put up a mast in it, and a sail made of
some of the ship's sail that he had in store ;
he added little lockers, or cupboards, andL CRLSCF SA'lS ROUND TriE |.;L;'<<NE)ROB/NSOJ\-' (RI/50E. ' 33

in the stern, and putting in two dozen loaves of barley bread, a pot full of

it must be done, he looked about to find a proper place, where there was
nice fresh grass and water to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.
He found a pretty piece of
meadow land with two or three
rills of water in it, and at one
end of it a very thick little wood.
He began enclosing this
ground for the space of quite two
miles, for he thought he had time
enough to do anything; but when
about fifty yards were done, he
~ remembered that the goats, in
such a space, would be nearly
wild, and he would have great
' trouble in chasing them to catch
them, so he resolved instead to
enclose a piece of about I 90 yards
in length and I00 yards in width.
He was three months hedging in
this ground. "When it was done he tethered the three goats in the best
part of it; and very often he took them ears of barley or a handful of rice
for a treat, and fed them out of his hand, so that when he let them loose
they followed him up and down hleating' fora handful of corn. In about
a year and a half he had I\ who goats, and in two years more three-and-
forty, besides several that he had killed for his food. After that he
enclosed five pieces more land with gates opening from one to the other,
and little pens to drive the goats into when he wanted to take one.
And now he. had not only goat's flesh to eat, but milk--a food he had
never hoped for, and which was an agreeable surprise. He set up a
dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of milk a day. He resolved,
therefore, to make cheese and butter, and after many vain attempts he
succeeded, and was never without it afterwards.

And Crusoe now, indeed, thanked God for all His mercies, for a
table had been spread for him in the wilderness, where he had at first
expected to die of hunger. lle wrote in his journal :--

" It would have made a stoic-smile " (a stoic was a severe person who
despised laughter and jests) "to have seen me and my little family sit

' down to dinner. There was my majesty the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command. I
could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and had no rebels
among all my subjects. Then to see how like a king I dined, too, all
alone, attended by my servants; Poll, as if she had been my fzwourite.
was the only person permitted to talk to me. My dog, who was now
grown old and crazy " (that is, not mad, but a little inferior) "sat always
at my right hand, and two cats, one on one side of the table and one on
the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand as a mark of
especial favour. ' _

" But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first,
for they were both of them dead, and had been buried near my habita-
tion by my own hands; but these were two that I had preserved tame ;
whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, and became, indeed, troublesome
to me at last, for they would often come into my house and plunder me,
too, till at last I was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many;
at length they left me. \Vith this attendance, and in this plentiful manner,
I lived ; neither could I be said to want anything but society, and of that
some time after this, I was like to have too much."

Crusoe had a strange uneasiness in his mind, inducing him to go
down to the point of the island where, in his last ramble, he went up the
hill to see how the shore lay, and how the current set, that he might see
how to get his boat back from where he had left it; this feeling increased
 

day by day, and at last he resolved to walk there, following the edge of
the shore.

He made the journey in live or six days. He travelled first along
the sea-shore directly to this place, where he had first brought his boat to
an anchor to get upon the rocks, and having
no boat now to take care of, he went over the
= land--a nearervay to the same height that he
was upon before ; when looking forward to
the points of the rocks, which ran out into the
sea, and which he had been obliged to sail
round, he was surprised now to see the sea all
smooth and quiet, no rippling, no motion, no
current, any more than in other places. He
' spent some time in watching it, and soon
.. understood that it must have been the ebb tide

7 setting from the west and joining the water of
M some great river falling into the ocean on the
shore that had caused the current. He found
that if he noticed and acted on the ebbing
and flowing of the tide, he could easily bring his boat round to the place
where he lived ; but when he remembered how dangerous his last voyage
had been, he was quite afraid to attempt another. He resolved instead
to build another boat, so that he would have one at his house and one at
this side of the island, which was near his. country dwelling, as he called
it. For you must understand that he had two places to live in on the
island. One was thetent under the rock, with the great wall of trees
round it and the cave behind, which Crusoe had now made much larger;
1n fact, several caves opened from it. One of these --the largest
and driest--had a door to it out beyond his wall, or, at least, close to
where the wall joined thc'rock ; this cave was all filled with earthen pots

l--__-_ -- '--ROBIA'SOAI' Cid/SOL". 41
that Crusoe had made, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, each
holclino five or six bushels; in these Crusoe laid up his piovisions, espe
cially his em 11 some in the car, some 1ubbecl out by the hand.

By this time the piles had taken root, 21nd were large trees, spreading
so much that it was not possible to see any dwelling behind them. Near
this abode were his two pieces of corn land, which he kept well sown, and
which bestowed on him good hartests. \Vhenever he should require
men: he could sow berond these fields, for he had plenty of land to
cultivate.

Besides this house he had his country seat, as he called it; the place
he found \\ hen he went on his first Journey and saw the grape Vines and
melons, the cocoa nuts and limes, ' ' '
and the shad)- trees and falling
water.

The trees he had planted round
the tent he had put up had besides
grown very tall, and, as he had cut
them to make them sprout and grow
thick, they made a most agreeable
shade; the woods also were near,
and made it a lovely spot. In the
centre of the great circle of trees _
he had put up a tent, which was
ahxa)s standing; it was made of :1 31C/ - - _
piece of a sail, spread over poles set for the purpose. Under this he had
made a bed of the skins of animals which he had killed, and other soft
things; a blanket, which he had saved from the wreck, lay over them, and
he had one of the great watch coats that he had brought on shore to
cover him. Near this tent he had enclosed places for goats, made very
strong with hedges and pales. You see Crusoe was never idle. One
pair of hands had made all these things. In this place, also, he had his
grapes growing, on which he depended for his winter raisins, the greatest
treat he had when the rains set in. They were very wholesome,
nourishing, and refreshing when he could not get much other fruit.

As this bower or country house was about half way between his home
and the place where he had fastened his boat, after he had landed from
his dangerous voyage, driven hither partly by the current, he generally
stayed here when he came to gather grapes or look after his boat, which
he frequently visited and kept in good repair. Sometimes he went out in
her for a little trip, but never very far; indeed, scarcely a stone's throw
from the shore--he was so much afraid of being carried away by currents
or winds, or any other accident.

You see how Crusoe, by patience and trying over and over again,
succeeded in making almost everything he wanted--a table, a chair,
shelves, earthenware, and baskets. We have omitted how he managed
to grind his corn for bread. \Ve will tell you now.

He spent many days in looking for a large stone that he could hollow
out like a mortar, but he could not lind one large enough, and, even if he
could have cut a piece out of the rock, it would ht ve been too soft to
hear the beating of a pestle--it would have gone to powder or sand.
which would have mixed with and spoiled the flour. So at last he
thought of making a wooden moltar. '

Ahtree grew in the. woods called the iron--tree, because it is as hard as
iron. Crusoe had seen the Indians in the Brazils make canoes out of it
by burning a hollow place in the middle of a trunk; he thought he
might do the same to make his mortar. He looked out, therefore, for a
great block of wood, and, getting one as big as he had strength to move,
he rounded it and formed it on the outside with his axe and hatchet, and
then burnt a hole in the middle as he had seen clone, and thus had a very
large, heavy wooden mortar. He made a great pestle or heater of the
 

same wood, and with this he pounded his corn to powder. But then
he wanted a sieve to part the husks from the corn. This was a very
difficult thing to manage.

But at length he found among his stores some neck-cloths of muslin,
and with some pieces of these he made three small sieves. How to bake
his bread was the next question ; he paved the hearth with some earthen-
ware tiles, made a great fire, and when the wood was burned to embers
he drew them forward upon these tiles so as to cover them; and he let them
he till the hearth was very hot; then he set his leaf or loaves on the hot
tiles, covered a large earthen pot over them, and drew the embers all
round it to keep in the heat: thus he baked his barley bread. in the
same way he made himself cakes and puddings of rice.

He had made himself a spade of the iron wood very long before this
time, and was careful to dig the ground and sow his grain at the right
season.

Crusoe had noticed a rather remarkable fact, viz: that it was on
the very same day that he ran away
from his father and mother and went
to sea at Hull, that ', he was taken by
the Sallee pirate and made a slave.
The same day of 1 the year that he was

saved from the ll ' wreck in Yarmouth
Roads he escaped from Sallee. The
same day he was born, 216., the '30th
of September, that same day twenty-
sixyears afterwards he \\ as c 3st ashore
on the island; so (as he says) his wicked life and his lonely life beam
on the same day.

It was really fortunate for him that he had to work so hard that very
little time was left for him to feel lonely. His days were days of very
 

hard toil, much harder than any he had run away from would have been,
and he was always glad to go to bed in his hammock, his faithful dog
beside him, after he had prayed to God to keep him in safety. But
Cruso'c's life was not to be lonely or safe much longer.

" It happened," he wrote, "one day about noon, going towards my
boat, I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like
one thunderstruck; I listened; I looked round me; I could hear nothing
nor see anything. I went up to a rising ground to see farther; I went
up the shore and down the shore, but it was all one. I could see no
other impression " (mark) " than that one. I went again to see if there
were any more, and to observe if it- might not be my fancy; but there
was no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot--toes,
heel, and every part of a foot ; how it came there I knew not, nor could
I in the least imagine."

Crusoe was very much frightened; he went back at once to his
fortification, looking behind him at every two or three steps, fancying
every tree stump was a man. He was too much alarmed to remember
afterwards how he got into his house (his castle, he now called it);
whether he went over by the ladder or by the hole in the rock that he
called a door.

He could not sleep at all that night; terrible thoughts kept him
awake. Suppose cannibals--that is, savages who eat men--were on the
island and had found his boat ? They would soon seek for him and find
him, and then they would eat him up. For you see, he knew it was the
mark of a savagc's foot, because the man had no shoes or stockings on.
And even if the savages did not cat him, they would take all his com
and his goats, and all the things he had made or saved from the wreck,
and would leave him to starve.

He was now, therefore, very anxious and unhappy; but one morning,CRUSCE SEES ik FOOTDRIN. ON' .iE SAND
lying in his bed, filled with thoughts about his danger from the appearance
of the savages, the words of the Bible that had first comforted him came
'into his mind: " Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee;" and then, rising cheerfully from his bed, he prayed ; he took his
Bible, and opening it to read, the first words he saw were these: " \~\>'ait
on the Lord and be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen thy heart;
wait, I say, on the Lord." It is impossible to tell you how much these
words comforted him. He laid down the book and was no more sad.
After all, he thought, it might have been the mark of his own foot that
he had seen; he might have made it when he went down to his boat.
Taking courage from this thought, he went out to milk his goats; but on
his way to his country house to do so, he kept looking behind him, and
every now and then running from a sound--he was so much afraid of
meeting the savages. However, he saw no one, and after three or {our
journeys to the bower he grew bolder, and went down to the shore to
look at the print of the foot again and measure it by his own. But he
was sorry to find that it was much larger than his. This caused him
to be as much afraid as at first.

And now he made a second strong wall of stakes and trees beyond
his first one, so as to shut in the door in the rock, which was outside the
first wall. He had planted trees there about twelve years before, and
these had grown so thick that they wanted only a few stakes to be driven
between them. He thickened this wall with timber. old cables, and every
thing he could think of to make it strong, leaving in it seven little holes
about as big as a man's arm. Then he thickened the old wall also by
continually bringing earth from his cave and laying it at the foot of it, and
then treading it down hard, till he had quite a mud wall outside the trees.
Through the seven holes in the new wall he put the seven muskets he
_ had brought from the wreck, fitting them into flames that held them like
cannon, so that he could fire all seven in two minutes of time. Then he
stuck all the ground near with stakes and osiers, which soon grew to a
grove, but he left room to see anyone who approached through them.

lle also moved his goats to separate and different places so that
they might not be found all together and all stolen at once.

He found a hollow place in the wood for part of them, and then he
went about the island looking for another hiding place, and came more
to the west point than he ever had been before; and here he thought
he saw a ship or boat out at sea, but too far off for him to be sure.
When he came down the hill, however, on the sands he. was very much
shocked at finding; the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of men, close by a place where a fire had been made in the earth
for the cruel savages to roast their prisoners. Crusoe could not help
shedding tears at this dreadful sight. From that time he. never walked
anywhere but to his country heuse and the place in the wood
where he. had left part of his flock of, goats. He did not even

7 go- to his boat. He
looked about, however,
near his bower for a
secure place -- a cave
would be best, he
thought--to hide his
flocks in, and while
searching he found a
place in the siclc of the
hill, where he saw that
he might safely wait to
watch if any of the
sa rages' boats came, and
-- even watch them when
they were on shore by hiding in some of the thickets of trees.
He therefore loaded two muskets and his usual gun, also his four
pistols with four bullets each, meaning to take them to this spot
when the savages next came ; and every morning he went to the top of
the hill near his castle, as he called it, to see if any boats came to the
island- though it was really three miles wrap--meaning to shoot the
savages. But when he thought it over, Crusoe knew that he had no
right to kill these men because they eat human beings, for they did not
know that it was wrong; he might only kill them to defend himself or
some living person. So he gave up the idea of shooting them. But he
grew very careful; he was afraid to make a tire beeeusc these wicked
people might see the smoke ; so he made some charcoal to cook his food
on. Charcoal is wood burnt under turf till it becomes dry, and it will
burn well enough to cook on, but it makes no smoke. So Crusoe burnt
some in the wood, and kept it for use.

\N'hile he was cutting down some wood for this purpose he saw,
behind a very thick branch of uncleru-'ood, a hollow place. He was so
curious as to look into it, and creeping under the branches, he found that
it was a cave large enough for him to stand upright in; but he made
great haste to get out again, for he saw two broad shining eyes looking
at him which twinkled like stars. However, on second thoughts, he
knew that it could only be an animal there. So he took :1 lighted piece
of wood and went in again. Holding the fire-brand over his head, he
saw that the eyes belonged to a very large fierce-looking lie-goat that
was dying. Crusoe touched it, but it was too ill to stand, and soon
died.

The cave was very small, not above twelve feet wide. but he saw a
small opening at the other end of it, very low, so that he would have to
crawl in at it on his hands and knees. However, as he was determined
to see where it led to, he came there again the next day, bringing with
him six candles and a tinder-box. lle had made the box and burnt
some rags in it, and for a steel to strike light he had the lock of one of the
muslcets. W'ith these lights he ventured to enter the inner cave, creeping,r
on his hands and knees. But when he was inside he thought he had
never seen anything so beautiful. The roof was twenty feet high, and it
was hung with points that looked like diamonds. These lovely hanging
jewels were really water turned to stone as it chipped. The grotto

then, nnxious to know where the savages were, he set his ladder by the
side of the hill, to a flat place in the rock, then drew it up after him. and
mounted by it to the top. 'l'aking out his telescope. he looked out and
saw no less than nine s: 'ztges, with very little clothes on, sitting round :1
fire. They had two Czilntnts with them, which they had drawn up on the
shore, and as it was then the tide of ebb ~>>--th:1t is, the water was going

that us they came with the Current caused by an chlrtide, they would not
come: when the tide rolled in, and that he would generally be safe all the
time of high-miter. As soon as the tide rolled in, the. savages got into
their canoes and rowed away, but before the): left they danced on the sand.

From that time Crusoe lived in great fear of these cruel savages
finding him. He dared not fire off his gun for fear of their hearing it;
and he was very thankful that he
had tame gmts ' I I ' to give. him food
and milk. On the. 16th
olthe next May there was a
great storm ; it blew very hard
and there was a great deal of
thunder and lightning. As
Crusoe sat reading his
Bible, he heard :1 sound like that of a gun at sea. Ile started up in great
haste, went up to the top of the hill, and came just in time to see a flash
of light and to hear the. sound of another gun. Then he knew that

to the top of the hill and set fire to it; it was all he could do; he l11.1(l

Crusoe hastened back to his castle, and prepared everything for a voyage.
He took a quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a compass to
steer by,a bottle of rum, and a.
b a s k etful of raisins. 'l'hus
loaded he went down to his
boat, baled the water out of
her, and got her afloat with
thiscargo; then he went home
a g a i n a n (1 brought back
a large bagful of rice, another
large pot of water, two dozen loaves, a bottle of goats milk, and
some cheese. He took all this food for fear he might be driven out to
sea, for he had to sail by the dangerous rocks and currents where he had
been nearly lost before. He was, indeed. rather uneasy about going, and
before he set out he went to the top of the hill and noticed the currents
carefiilly, He found that the. current of the ebb-tide set out close by the
shore of the north side, so he. had nothing to do but to keep to the north
side of the island on his return and he would do well enough.

T he next morning he embarked with the first of the tide, and by the
help of the strong current he reached the wreck in two hours. It was
sad to see the good ship, which was a Spanish one, jammed in between
two rocks, all the stern and quarter of her beaten in by the sea. \thn
Crusoe came close to her a dog appeared, who, seeing him, yelped and
cried, and as soon as Crusoe called to him, jumped into the sea and
swam on shore. Crusoe took him into the boat. The poor animal was
nearly dead with hunger and thirst. Crusoe gave him a cake of his
barley bread, and he ate it like a ravenous wolf ; he then give the poor
creature some fresh water. After this he went on hoard the wreck.

He found in the cook--room two dead men with their arms round each
other, and he thought that before the ship struck, the vaves must have50 [COB/N503" CRUSO/f.

dashed over her, so continually that the men were not able to hear it,
and were strangled with the constant rushing in of the water. Besides
the dog there was nothing left- in the ship that had life, and all the goods
in her were spoiled by the sea. He got two chests, however, into his
boat, and a powder horn, and tire-shovel and tongs, also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a'gridiron-all of them
things that he had greatly wanted.
With this cargo and the dog he
returned with the tide to the
shore.

He slept that night in his
boat, and the next day he carried
his new property to the cave he
had found, meaning to leave
it there. He found in the
chests a line case of bottles of
cordial waters (we call them now
liqueurs)---the bottles held three
pints,---ahout a dozen and a half
of white handkerchiefs, some
shirts, and coloured neck-cloths,
also three great bags of money,
and some small bags of gold.

About two years after this
adventure Crusoe had a strange
dream of some savages landing
and being about to eat a man, when he ran away, came into Crusoc's
grove, stayed with him, and became his servant. This dream came
true, as you will see.

He was surprised one morning byseeing five canoes all on shorelt'O/IIrVS 0.1V CRUSOE. 57

running down the hill, cr1'1sae1l to the sea by a short cut, and came
between the man who was running away and his enemies. Crusoe
beckoned to him to come back, but the poor savage was at first as much
afraid of the strange-looking man as of the savages. Meantime Crusoe,
rushing at the foremost savage, knocked him down with his gun. He
did not want to fire it For fear of bringing all the other savages on him.53 l?0[2[1\-"SO.=\" CK USOE.

Having knocked this fellow down, the man with him stopped as if
frightened, and Crusoe was going to spare him. but as he came near he.
saw the savage was fixing an arrow to a bow to shoot him, so Crusoe
was obliged to lire first; he did
so, and killed the man at the first
shot. The poor
savage who had lied stopped
when he saw his enemies fall, but
w s50 frightened by the fire and
noise of the gun that he stood
stock still. Crusoe made signs to him to come nearer, which he
understood. He came forward a few paces, then stopped, and again
moved on and stopped: kneeling down eveiy ten or twelve steps as if
to thank Crusoe for saving his life.

Crusoe smiled at him and looked kind, and beckoned to him. The
poor sax-age had never seen a white man, or a man dressed in skins,
before, and the gun seemed to him a dreadful thing; but at length he
came quite up to Crusoe, and kneeling down again kissed the ground and
laid his head on it, and taking hold of Crusoe's foot. lifted it on his head.

This, it seems, meant that he would be his white friend's slave for
ever. Crusoe took him up, and made much of him. But now he saw
that the savage whom he had knocked down and stunned, but not killed,
was beginning to come to himself, and was so much better that he could
sit up on the ground, and Crusoc's savage began to look afraid.
Robinson, however, presented his gun at the. man as if to shoot him, and
then the savage he had saved made signs that Crusoe should give him
his sword which hung naked in a belt by his side. Crusoe gave it to
him, and he at once ran to his enemy and cut off his head with one
blow. When he had done this he went laughing to his deliverer, and
laid the sword and the savages head at his feet)IRIDA" KNEELS IO ROB|\SON CRL/SOE.
 

Then he made signs at the dead one who was shot, and went up to
him and saw that he was quite (lead, and yet had only a little hole in his
breast, and there was, very little blood, for he. had bled inwardly. The
wonder of Crusoe's savage was very great; but he took up the. dead
man's bow and arrows and came back with them. Crusoe turned and
beckoned to him to follow him ; but the savage. made signs that he had
better bury the dead ones, for fear the others should find them. Crusoe
nodded "Yes," and directly the young man began to dig a hole in the
sand with his hands, and did it so well and so fast, that he had buried
hoth bodies out of sight in a quarter of an hour. Then, calling him,
Crusoe led him away, not to his castle, but to the cave at the. other part
of the island, so he did not let his dream come to pass fully, for in that
the savage came into Crusoe's grove for shelter. But it would not have
been safe to trust the unknown savage with the secret of Robinson's
castle, you know, and the cave was a great way from it'.

In this cave, you may remember. Cmsoe-had stored his powder and
several other stores. He had also in it a quantity of rice-straw, a blanket,
and provisions, all ready in case the Savages should come to the island
and force him to hide there. The poor savage he had saved was quite
trustworthy, but Crusoe could not know that at first, so it was only
prudent not to let him see too much, for he might have got away at some
future time and brought the other savages to rob and kill his new
friend.

l-Iowever, Crusoe meant to be very kind to the man ; indeed, he was
most thzmkf'ul to hear a human being's voice again and look in a man's
tau; and the savage had a pleasant countenance and a sweet voice, and
proved in the end a faithful friend and servant. He was very much
exhausted now by his swift flight from the cannibals, and his great
previous fear. Perhaps, too, he was uneasy at being in the poWer of the
man who could kill people at a distance, as he had just seen ; but Crusoe62

kindly gave. him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught
of water, which he wanted very much, for he was thirsty after his hard
running. Having thus fed him, Crusoe pointed to a place where he. had

Crusoe left him asleep, and went to milk his goats; but soon the
savage came rtmningg,r out to him and made all the former signs of
thanking him and being ready to obey him. In a little while. Crusoe
took some milk in an earthen pot and let him see him drink it. and sup
bread in it. The savage did the. same directly, and then made signs
that he thought it very nice.

Crusoe next taught him a few words. He made him understand
that he meant to call him Friday, because that was the day on which he
was saved ; and he taught him to say " Master," and "Yes" and " No,"
and to know the meaning" of these words.

The next day Crusoe went with him to the place where they had buried
the men, and Friday made signs that they could dig them up and eat
them ! but Crusoe by signs also showed him what a horrid thing it wasROS/JVSON C R (5'05 . 63

 

to eat human flesh. They then went up the hill and saw from it that the
savages had gone away, leaving the beach covered with bones of the men
they had eaten. Crusoe went to the spot and made. Friday bury all these
bones. Then he took him to his castle and set about dressing him. He
had found some linen drawers in the poor gunner's chest that he saved
from the wreck. 'l'hese he gave to Friday and they fitted him. Then
Crusoe made him a jerkin of goat's skin and a cup of hare's skin. Friday
was very proud of his clothes.

Crusoe made a little tent for the savage between his walls; and to
ensure his own safety he made a door that he could bolt or bar before
sleeping; taking in also his ladders, so that Friday could not get at him
in the night. He took also all his guns with him to bed. In order to
cure Friday of his love of men's flesh as food,
Crusoe took him with him and shot a kid for
his dinner. Friday was dreadfully frightened
at the gun, and opened his own waistcoat to
see if he was shot! Crusoe also shot a parrot;
and as he did not let Friday see how. he loaded
the. gun, the poor savage thought there must
be something wonderful in it, and used to talk
to it and ask it not to kill him. 'Crusoe gave
him boiled kid and broth ; and next time,
when he roasted some kid, and Friday had
tasted it, he said that he would never again eat
man's flesh.

He soon taught Friday to make bread
also, and to help him to fence in more ground
for sowing, since now that there were two to eat bread, he must plant
more com.

It was so very delightful to have a man to talk to, that Crusoe took64 ROS/AiS'Oi-V C R U501? .

 

great pains to teach Friday to speak English, and the savage learned it
very soon.

One day, Crusoe asked him if his nation ever conquered in battle.
Friday said, " Oh, yes; we fight better."

" How were you taken, then i" asked Crusoe.

Friday answerec, "' They more many than my nation. They take one,
two, three, and me, and make go in canoe.
My nation have no canoe--that true."

" Do your nation eat the men they take
as these clic ?" asked Crusoe.

"Oh, yes," said Friday; "my nation
eat mans, too--<<rat all up."

"VV'hcxc do they carry them?" asked
Crusoe. " GO to other
place, where they 1% think," said Friday.

"Do t'hu come here?"

" Yes, yes, they come here; come other else place."

" l lave you been here with them .9" asked Crusoe.

"' Y es, 1 been here," pointing to the northwest side of the island.

'l'hen Crusoe understood that his man Friday had been among the
sa rages on the further part of the island. He took him there, and learned
from him that they had eaten twenty men, two women, and one child
there!

Crusoe heard also from him that no canoe was ever lost ; that a little
way out at sea there was a current and wind always one way in the
morniwr and another in the afternoon. He told Crusoe also that his
people \\ ere called Caribs, and that :i great way bcvond the moon---that
is, to the u- est~---there was a country with bearded white men, like him,
and that they had killed "much mans." Crusoe thought these must be

Crusoe began to teach him about God. At first he asked Friday who
made him; but the poor sa rage thought he mezmt who was his father.
Then Crusoe asked him who made the sun, the earth, and the hills.
 

Friday said, " It was old Benanmchcc, that lived beyond all." He
'said that this great person was very old, " much older than the sea, the
moon. and the stars." Crusoe asked him then, if this old person had
made everything, why all things did not worship him? Ht: looked
very grave, then, with a perfect look of innocence, said, "All things
say ' O ' to him." Crusoe asked him if people who dicd in his country

went anywhere? He said, " Yes, they all went to Bcnamuchee." He

asked him if those

and gracious Father in heaven. I told him how Adam and Eve sinned,
and how the Lord Jesus Christ came on earth to save us."

Friday often asked Crusoe very puzzling questions, and then CrusoePUG

would send him away for a time, and pray to God to make him able to
teach this poor man all that was right and true.

Crusoe used to read the Bible to him, and always tried to let him
know, as well as he could, the meaningr of what he read. Friday asked
many questions, and Crusoe had to think and to study God's "ford a
great deal in order to answer them. Thus he himself leamed much more
of God's word than he had ever known before by teaching Friday.

W'hen Crusoe found that Friday could quite understand him, he told
the kind savage the story of his own shipwreck, and showed him the
place where his vessel went on shore. There was no sign of her now.
He also showed Friday the boat, which he had never been able to more.
and which was now falling to pieces. Friday stood looking at it for
some time, and Crusoe asked him of what he was thinking. Friday
answered, " Me see such boat like come to place at my nation."

Crusoe did not understand him at first, but by--and-bye he learned
that such a boat had come on shore on the savages coast. 1' riday
described it, and added, with some eagerness, " We save the white mans
from drown."

He asked him if white mans were in boat.

" Yes," he said, " the boat full of white mans."

He counted on his fingers seventeen. I asked him what had become
of them. He said that they lived still. that they had been in his country
four years, and the people fed them.

" How was it," said Crusoe, "that they did not kill and eat them ? "

The answer was, " They makes brothers with them; they no eat
white mans but when make the war fight."

Some time after, being upon the top of the hill at the east side of the
island, Friday (the weather being very clear) looked to the mainland and
began jumping, and dancing, and calling to Crusoe, who asked him what
was the matter.
 

 

"0 joy!" said he; "0 glad! there see my countryH--there my
nations."

He looked so happy that Crusoe began to feel uneasy. If 1" riday
went back to his savage people, Crusoe thought he would most likely
tbrget all he had been taught, and would perhaps return with a hundred
of his countrymen and make a feast of his master.

One day soon after, therefore, he said, " Friday, do you wish to go'
back to your own nation ? "

"Yes," he said, " I be much glad to be at my own nation."

"\Vhat would you do there," said Crusoe; "would you eat men's
flesh again and be a savage? "

He looked hurt, shook his head, and said, " No, no; Friday tell them
to be good ; tell them to pray to God ; tell them to eat corn bread, cattle
flesh, milk; no out mam again,"

Crusoe asked him if he Would go back to them ; he. said he could not
swim so Err. Crusoe told him that he would make a canoe For him.
Then he said he would go if Crusoe did, and he would make his people
love his master, and not eat him. " W'ish we both there," he. said another

' time; "no wish 1" riday there no
master there."

" W' hat should I do there?"
said Crusoe.

1'~ riday said quickly, "You
leachee men be good, pray to God."

" No, Friday," said his master,
"you must go without me." Then Friday ran and got a hatchet, gave
it to his master, and said, " You kill Friday."

" Why ? " asked Crusoe.

" Take--kill Friday," said the poor affectionate fellow, " but no send
Friday away. "
 

This showed Crusoe that he might trust his man. and he. at once set
ab0ut building a canoe. Friday knew what wood would be best to make
it of, found the tree and cut it down, and the two went to work and built
a very large canoe or boat, large enough to hold twenty men. Then
Crusoe set to work to put :1 mast in it: and finding some. old canvas still
left from the sails of the lost ship, he made a shoulder of mutton sail, as
it is called, for the canoe. He was two months making it. You see,
Crusoe had great patience, and never gave up trying to do a thing.
Then he sailed out . , V '_ in his boat and
taught Friday how ' " to manage a sail and

never drank it except as a medicine. He would not have been alive and
so comfortable if he had drunk spirits.
Then Crusoe gave Friday half the pistols and a gun, and they went

 

out to look after the savages.
Friday peeped from behind a tree,
and said that they were sitting
round the fire eating one prisoner,
and that another was lying bound
to he killed and eaten next, and
that the hound man was one of
the white men who had landed in

Friday's country. Crusoe at once resolved to save this man's life if
possible. So they crept on from lrcc' to tree till they came to a thicket,

then they both fired into the savages. Friday killed two of them
and wounded three more, and Crusoe killed one and wounded two.
 

The savages were dreadfully frightened. They jumped up, but did not
know what to do or where to run.

Crusoe and his mun fired a second time and wounded so many that:
the savages did nothing but yell and fall down. Then Fridayr fiillowed
Crusoe as he rushed forward out of the wood, and while Friday fired
again on the savages, who were now all running to their canoes, Crusoe
went to the white prisoner and set him free, lifting him up and asking
him in the Portuguese language, who he was. Thepoor man answered,
"A Christian," but was so weak he could scarcely stand or speak.
Crusoe 81'. re him soxncin-'ater from his bottle and :1 piece of bread, and
then the prisoner told him that he was a Spaniard. Crusoe said, " Sir,
we can talk by-ameyc ; now we must light." And he gave him a pistol
and sword. The Spaniard took them and used them very bravely.
Crusoe had left more guns near'the tree they were under first, and the
three men soon drove the savages to their canoes ; but they left a great

A canoe was also " ' left ; in it Crusoe
found a poor savage, also bound {or eating.
I-Ie cut the rushes that held him, but the
poor man thought directly that Crusoe
was going to cut him, and growled. Then
Crusoe culled Friday to speak to him and
tell him that he was sale; and who do you
think the prisoner was? Friday's old
father! 1' riday was so delighted to see him; he kissed him and
hugged him, and then he jumped and danced for joy. Crusoe asked
him if he had given his father lu'ezttl. He. shook his head and sztid,
" None; ugly dog eat up all self." So Crusoe gave the old man :1 cake
and some raisins, and a little rum for Friday himself, but the good son
made his {other drink it.
And now Crusoe had three human beings with him, and one a white
man and a Christian. A dreadful storm came on that night, and many
of the savages' canoes were swallowed in the sea; only a few men got
home. and they told such a terfihle story of being killed by thunder and
lightning, and the loss was so Great of the people, that the savaocs
thouxrht that the. island must he enchanted, and never came there again
while Crusoe was on it.

Crusoe and the Spaniard became great friends. The Spaniard told
him that he and sixteen men had escaped from the wreck of the Spanish
ship and been saved on Friday's island, where the people were kind to
them, but that they had little food and would be glad to escape. So
when Crusoe had planted more com in order to have enough for
them to eat, the Spaniard and Fridays father went to the island in
Crusoe's new canoe, intending to bring-the shipwrecked men over in it,
Crusoe first making the Spaniard promise that they should all obey him
while they were on his island.

The Spaniard and Friday's father had been gone about eight days
when, as Crusoe was asleep in his room one morning, his man 1" riday
came running in calling out, "Master, master, they come!" Crusoe
hastened out, but saw at once that it \ as not his canoe but a ship's boat
that was cominw to the land, though as yet a "rent way oil Then he
told Friday to l<eep close till they Lnew who the b'people in the boat "ere.
And by-and-hye he climbed the hill and plainly saw a ship lying at
anchor about four or five miles From the shore.

You may imagine how glad Crusoe was to see a ship at last, and yet
he had some fears about it. He did not know if she brought friends or
enemies, so he lt'S(.)lV('(.l to keep on his guard. The ship might belong
to a pirate or salt-water thief, and Crusoe might run the risk of being
murdered and robbed. He watched the boat come on shore, therefore,
lying down, so that the sailors in her should not see him, and he noticedP_.||

with joy that they did not find the little creek where Crusoe used to land
his rafts, but ran the boat ashore along the beach about half a mile off.
""hen the men landed, Crusoe could see through his telescope that they
looked like Englishmen, with one or two Dutchmen among them, and
they were very ill-looking people. There were in all eleven men, but
three or them had their hands tied, and when the first four or five jumped
out of the boat, they took out these three as prisoners, one of them making
signs as if he were begging for mercy. 1'~ riday called out when he saw this,
" 0 master! you see Englishmans eat prisoner as well as savage mans."

"Vt"hy," said Crusoe, "do
you think, Friday, that they
are going to eat them ? "

"Yes," said Friday, "they
will eat them."

" N0," said Crusoe, "I am
afraid they will murder them;
but you may he sure they will not eat them," but he wished very much
now that he had had the Spank-1rd and Friday's father there to help him.

He stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every
moment that the three prisoners would be killed. Once he saw one of
the villains lift up his arm with a great Cutlass or sword to strike one of
the poor men, and he expected to see him {all every moment, and all the
blood in Crusoe's body seemed to turn chill in his veins. He wished
that there. were. any way of getting within gun range of them, that he
might have saved these three men: for he saw that the crew had no lire-
arms amongst them. After he had observed the cruel usage of the
prisoners by these insolent seamen, he saw the fellows run scattering about
the island, as if they wanted to see the country. The three captiv 's were
left on the shore, where they sat on the ground very pensive, and looking like
men in despair. The evil--looking seamen had landed at high water ; when78 R01}! NS 0N CR (/5011

 

they returned the tide had ebbed and left the boat aground. They tried
together olT, but could not; and then Crusoe heard one of them call
out, "Why, lct _ _ her alone, Jack,
can't ye; she will ' float next tide."
And they all went off, lea ring
the three prison- era--who were
not bound now, however--onthe
beach. Now Crusoe
knew that the: boat would not
float for the next __ _ _ ten hours, when
it would be dark. And he armed
himself at once, and Friday also: for he (Friday) was now u very good
shot. Crusoe put on his goat-skin cap, a naked sword at his side, two
pistols in his belt, and a gun on each shoulder, and looked very fierce.
About two o'clock he saw that the three poor men had moved under the
shade of a tree about a quarter of a mile off, and, as Crusoe thought,
out of sight of the sailors.

lle resolved to go to them and find out all about them. He set OFT.
therefore, with his man Friday, to whom he had given three loaded
muskets to carry ; and as he came near them he said in Spanish, " Who
are you, gentlemen ? "

T hey started up and stared at this strange figure.

"Gentlemen," said Crusoe, in English, "do not be surprised. Per-
haps you have a friend near you that you did not erpect "

" He must be from Heaven then, for we are past the help of man,
said one of them

"All help is from Heaven," Crusoe answered. "I saw you land,
and one of the sailors lifted his sword to kill you. W' hat is the matter ? "

Then the Englishman told Crusoe that he was the captain of the
ship, that his men had mutinied: that is, they had refused to obey himROSIAKS'0A7 CR USO/'1'. 79

 

and had threatened to kill him, but at last had consented to set him, his
mate. and a passenger ashore on this desolate island. '

" \Vhere are these wretched sailors ? asked Crusoe.

" There they are, sir, " he answered, pointing to a thicket of trees.

" Have the\-.r an)- firearms? ' asked Crusoe.

The captain said only two guns, one of which they had left in the
boat. Crusoe asked him then if he should kill them or take them
prisoners while they were asleep. The captain said that there were two
very wicked men amongst them, to whom it was not safe to show mercy,
but if they 'were secured he thought the others would be sorry and would
return to their duty. Crusoe gave the captain and his companions a gun
each, and the captain, taking it and a pistol in his hand, accompanied by
his two companions, went towards the sleeping seamen. A slight noise
they made awoke one of the men, who called to the others; but it was too
late then. The two men fired, and taking aim at the worst of thc
mutineers, killed one and wounded the other, who called For help; but
the captain told him his villainy had been too great for pardon, and
knocked him down with the butt end of his musket. There were only
three left now, and one of these was wounded. They saw Crusoe and
Friday approaching, and begged For mercy, promising to return to their
duty. The captain was willing.)r to fiwgive them, z-md Crusoe consented
on condition that they were kept bound all the time they were on the
island. The three men who had gone away returned now, and seeing
that their captain was conqueror, begged for mercy, and were easily made
prisoners. Crusoe: then ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go
to the boat and hrinq away the oars and sail, and by the captain's advice
she was then drawged up high on the land and a hole made in her bottom,
so that if the sailors left In the ship, n ho \\ etc all mulineers, came on shore
they could not take her away. And now the ship began to make signals
to the sailors on shore; waited her flag and fired a gun to call them on80 ROB/J (VOA? C/(USO/f.

board; but finding that they did not come, she hoisted out another boat
and sent ten men with guns in her to find their shipmates. Crusoe
meantime had sent most of the prisoners to his cave ; lmt two of them
begged for pardon and promised to
serve Crusoe faithfiilly. So they
were set free, and arms given them.
Meantime the men from the ship
landed and drew their boat up on
the beach. Then they ran to their
other boat, and it was easy to see that
they were very much surprised to find nothing in her, and a great hole
in her bottom. They set up great shouts then to call their comrades,
and fired otT their guns, but the men in the cave could not hear them.
\Vomlering what the disappearance of their comrades meant the seamen
went back to the ship; but soon returned, and leaving,r three men in
their boat to take care of her, they anchored her a good way from the
shore; and then the other seven men started altogether to go in search
of their missing comrades.

We have not room in this little book to tell you all the clever plans
Crusoe and his friends carried out:
but they managed at last to take all
the mutineers prisoners, after the
captain had shot the wicked boatswain
who had persuaded the men to
mutiny. The captain frightened the
prisoners by talkingr of Crusoe as the
governor of the. island, and saying that he would hang them ; and they
at last begged for mercy. They were pardoned; but W" ill Atkins, one
. of the worst, and two others were pinioned and sent bound to the cave
where the first men had been sent.

found in the two wrecks. He had been twengr-eight years on the island,
and no doubt :15 he and Friday sailed away from it they both felt a little
regret at parting from their old home.

Crusoe, on arriv- r"'--" --- > - -- ing in Englandfound
all his friends dead, except the captain's
widow, who took care of his money.
Sohe went to Lisbon to learn from the
agent of his Brazil plantation how it had
got on. He found that it had prospered
so well that he was quite a rich man now.
W hen this business was settled he felt a
great dislike to go to linglund again by a
long sea voyage, so he resolved to travel
through Spain and France to Calais,
and cross to Dover. In those days this
was a long,r and even a dangerous
journey, generally made in company
with others.
He found a traveller to join him, and took several servants also. As
they were journeying through some forests in Spain, they were one (lziy
much alarmed by the appearance of a great hear coming out of the wood.
\Vhen Friday saw him, hog-u
ever, he was quite pleased.

" Oh, oh, 0 h ! " 5:1 i (l
Friday, point-- ing to him;
" Oh, master, you give me

" Oh -! " said Crusoe, "he will eat you up."

" Eatce me up, catcc me up l" said Friday, twice over; " me catce
him 1.11) Me make you good laugh; you all stay here; me show you
good laugh."

So down hes ;:1t took all his boots, and put on 21 pair of flat shoes
that he had in his pocket, ga1e another scn'ant his ""4""th
horse, and with his gun away he flew. The bear 1
was walking softly on, not 111edd|i11g with anyone ,.
till Friday came very near him
and made him :1 how.

"Hark ye, hark ye," says
Friday, "me Spenkee wit you,"
and he took up a great stone
and threw it at the hear. The
bear feeling it turned and came

And he turned on one side and beckoning to them to follow, climbed upa
grunt oak tree, first laying his gun down near the: bottom of the trunk. The
bear soon came: to the tree, stopped L'll' the gun and smelt it, then followed
Friday up the trunk, climbing like a grant uwk\ and cat. \thn Crusoe
came to the tree, thcrc was Friday got
out to the small end of a large branch.
and the hear about halfway after him.
AS soon as
the bear got
out to the
pzut of the
branch that
waswcakcst,
" Ha !" cried
Friday, to
the travel--
lers, " now
you_scc me
tcachcc boar
dance," so
he jumped up and down, and shook the bough till the bear began
to tolter and stood still and looked behind him, as if to see how
he should get down. "Will you come further?" cried Friday, and
the bear went on again; but Friday shook the branch once more,
and again it stood still.

Crusoe was going to shoot the animal then, but Friday cried,
"Oh pray, oh pray, no shoot; me shoot by and than," and he once
more began to give the bear a dancing lesson, shaking the animal
up and down.

When at last the bear would not move, he said, "\Vcll, you
 

no come further, me come to you," and he went out to the very end
of the bough and gently. letting himself fall from it to his feet, ran
away to his gun, and stood still. W' hen the bear saw his enemy gone,
he turned and began to climb down the trunk of the oak very slowly.
Then Friday went up close to him, put his gun near his head, and shot
him, Crusoe and his fellow-travellers were very much amused by this
dance of the bear.

There were also great numbers of wolves in these woods. Once,
about two hours before night, the guide being a little in advance of the
party, three great wolves and a bear rushed out of the forest, and two of
the wolves attacked the guide who cried out for help. Crusoe sent on
Friday to see what was the matter, and the brave savage, crying "0
master! 0 master l" rode
directly up to the poor man,
put his pistol to the wolf's
head and shot h i m dead.
This h a p - pened just be'
fore he made. g"; thelieardance.
Theynow saw many wolves
but managed to Scare them
away by all shouting together. But at another (awning of the wood they
were startled by seeing a horse with a saddle and bridle on him rush out,
with sixteen or seventeen wolves after him. That night the travellers
Were attacked by them and had to shelter themselves behind some felled
trees, and fight for their lives. They had to lay trains of gunpowder and
blow these cruel animals up with it, for there were three hundred hungry
wolves attacking them. They were very glad when they had entered
France, through which they passed in perfect safety, crossed the Channel,
and landed again in England.

Robinson Crusoe married soon after this journey, and made a home
for himself. Can you not imagine how pleased Friday must have been
at all the wonderful things he saw in England?

But Crusoe was always thinking of his island, and by--and-bye he
visited it again. It was on this last voyage
that his ship was attacked by savages, and
' that an arrow struck his poor man Friday,
and killed him.

Crusoe was very grieved and very angry;
he had the guns on board fired at the
savages' canoes, and drove them off; but
Friday only lived a few moments afterwards,
and died in his dear master's arms.

Robinson Crusoe arrived safely in
England at last, after many other adven-
tures, and did not again tempt the seas.

He lived to be a very old man, but he
never forgot the island nor his dear man
Friday, who had loved him so well, and
been so good and faithful. For all time
the name of poor Friday will be remembered with that of
