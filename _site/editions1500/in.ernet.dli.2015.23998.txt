INTRODUCTION 


“ The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson 
Crusoe, of York, Mariner: who lived eight-and-twenty 
years all alone in an uninhabited island on the coast of 
America, near the mouth of the great River Oroonoque ; 
having been cast on shore by shipwreck, wherein all the 
men perished but himself. With an account how he was 
at last strangely delivered by Pirates. Written by himself." 

Such was the ample title under which Daniel Defoe 
issued the first part of his romance in 1719. That first 
part is the inspired work of art ; complete and sufficient. 
Founded upon the actual adventures of Alexander Selkirk, 
it commences with the restless longings of the boy for travel 
and adventure by sea ; it reaches its supreme climax of 
shipwreck and the ultimate triumph of man's resource 
over the merciless forces of nature ; and it closes with the 
happy return home of the wanderer, his marriage and 
comfortable settlement upon his farm in Bedfordshire. 
But success drove Defoe to upset this perfect rounding off 
of a complete episode. Within six months he had taken 
up the tale again and sent the wanderer off afresh, in 
spite of the irresistible finality of family life and middle 
age which the close of the first part implied. Of course 
Cnisoe goes back to his island ; but how different is the 
atmosphere thenl The island is no longer a place of 
mystery and enchantment : it is a mere tropical setdement.

INTRODUCTION 


Instead of one man alone with Nature we find all the petti* 
nesses of a community. 

To the average boy the magic of Robinson Crusoe lies 
entirely within the bounds of Part I., and this is the apology, 
if one is needed, for the present volume, the title of which 
does but give in eight words the essence of the ample one 
quoted above.

THE ADVENTURES OF 
ROBINSON CRUSOE 

ON HIS ISLAND 

I was bom in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good 
family* My father got a good estate by merchandise, 
and leaving off his trade, married my mother, whose 
relations were named Robinson, a very good family, from 
whom I was called Robinson Kreutsnaer ; but by the 
usual corruption of words in England we are now called, 
nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe, and 
so my companions always called me* 

My head began to be filled very early with rambling 
thoughts* My father had given me a competent share 
of learning, and designed me for the law ; but I would 
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my inclina- 
tion to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the 
commands, of my father, and against all the entreaties and 
persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there 
seemed to be something fatal in that propension of nature 
tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me* 
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and 
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design* 
He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was 
confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with 
me upon this subject* He pressed me earnestly, and in 
the most affectionate manner, not to precipitate myself 
into miseries which Nature and the station of life I was 
bom in seemed to have provided against, saying that I 
was under no necessity of seeking my bread ; that he 
would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into 
the middle station of life which he had been recommending

to me. I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as 
indeed who could be otherwise i and I resolved not to 
think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home 
according to my father's desire. But alas ! a few days 
wore it all off ; and in a few weeks after I resolved to 
run away. 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, 
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to 
all proposals of settling to business. But being one day 
at Hull, and one of my companions being going by sea to 
London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to go with 
them, with the common allurement of seafaring men, viz*, 
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted 
neither father or mother any more, nor so much as sent 
them word of it ; but, in an ill hour, God knows, on the 
first of September, 1651, I went on board a ship bound for 
London. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the 
Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the waves to 
rise in a most frightful manner ; and as I had never been 
at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body, and 
terrified in my mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon 
how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of heaven for 
my wicked leaving my father's house, and abandoning my 
duty. All this while the storm increased. I expected 
every wave would have swallowed us up, and in this agony 
of mind I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would 
please God here to spare my life this one voyage ; if ever I 
got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly 
home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while 
I lived. 

The next day the wind was abated and the sea calmer, 
and I began to be a little inured to it. However, I was very 
grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still ; but; 
towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite 
over, and a charming fine evening followed ; the sun went 
down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning ; and 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE n 

having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the $un shining 
upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful 
that ever I saw. I had slept well in the night, and was now 
no more sea-sick but very cheerful. And now my com- 
panion, who had enticed me away, comes to me : “ Well, 
Bob,” says he, clapping me on the shoulder, “ how do you 
do after iti I warrant you were frighted, wa’n't you, 
last night, when it blew but a capful of wind < ” “A 
capful, d'you call it < " said I ; “ ’twas a terrible storm." 
" A storm, you fool you,” replies he ; “ do you call that a 
storm i Why, it was nothing at all ; give us but a good ship 
and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a sq uall of 
wind as that ; but you're but a fresh-water sailor. Bob. 
Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we'll forget all 
that ; d'ye see what charming weather 'tis now i ” To 
make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way 
of all sailors ; the punch was made, and I was made drunk 
with it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all 
my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, 
and all my resolutions for my future. 

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth 
roads ; the wind having been contrary and the weather 
calm, we had made but little way since the storm. Here 
we were obliged to come to an anchor, the wind continuing 
contrary, viz., at south-west. After we had lain four or five 
days, the wind blew very hard. However, the roads being 
reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and 
our ground-tackle very strong, our men where unconcerned, 
and not in the least apprehensive of danger; but the 
eighth day in the morning the wind increased, and we had 
all hands at work .to strike our topmasts, and make every- 
thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as 
possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our 
ship shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice 
our anchor had come home ; upon which our master 
ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two 



xa ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

anchors ahead. By this time it blew 1 a terrible storm 
indeed, and now I began to see terror and amazement in 
the faces even of the seamen themselves. The master, 
though vigilant to the business of preserving the ship, yet 
as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear 
him sofdy to himself say several times, “ Lord be merciful 
to us, we shall be all lost, we shall be all undone ; " and 
the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still 
in my cabin, which was in the steerage ; I could ill reassume 
the first penitence ; I thought the bitterness of death 
had been past, and that this would be nothing too, like 
the first. But when the master himself came by me, as 
I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dread- 
fully frighted ; I got up out of my cabin, and looked out. 
But such a dismal sight I never saw ; the sea went moun- 
tains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes. 

Towards evening they had cut away the foremast, but 
the mainmast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, 
they were obliged to cut her away also, and make a clear 
deck. But the worst was not come yet ; the storm con- 
tinued with such fury, that the seamen themselves acknow- 
ledged they had never known a worse. We had a good ship, 
but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that 
the seamen every now and then cried out she would 
founder. It was my advantage in one respect, that I did 
not know what they meant by founder till I inquired. 
In the middle of the night, one of the men that had been 
down on purpose to see cried out we had sprung a leak ; 
another said there was four foot water in the hold. Then 
all hands were called to the pump. At that very word my 
heart died within me, and I fell backwards upon the side of 
my bed where I sat. However, the men roused me, and 
told me, that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as 
well able to pump as another ; at which I stirred up and 
went to the pump and worked very heartily. 

The master continually fired guns for help ; and a light 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 13 

ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat 
out to help us ; but it was impossible for us to get on 
board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at last 
the men rowing very heartily, our men cast them a rope 
over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a 
great length, which they after great labour and hazard took 
hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and got 
all into their boat. We made but slow way towards the 
shore, nor were we able to reach it till being past the light- 
house at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward 
towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the vio- 
lence of the wind. Here we got all safe on shore, and 
walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where we were 
used with great humanity, and had money given us suffi- 
cient to carry us either to London or back to Hull as we 
thought fit. 

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and 
have gone home, I had been happy, but my ill fate pushed 
me on with an obstinacy that nothing could resist ; and 
though I had several times loud calls from my reason and 
my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no 
power to do it. 

It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good company 
in London. I first fell acquainted with the master of a ship 
who had been on the coast of Guinea, and was resolved to 
go again. He told me if I would go the voyage with him 
I should be at no expense ; I should be his messmate and 
his companion ; and if I could carry anything with me, 
I should have all the advantage of it that the trade would 
admit. I embraced the offer, went the voyage with him, 
and carried a small adventure with me, which, by the dis- 
interested honesty of my friend the captain, I increased very 
considerably, for I carried about £40 in such toys and trifles 
as the captain directed me to buy. This £40 I had mus- 
tered together by the assistance of some of my relations 
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my 



14 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

father, or at least my mother, to contribute so much as 
that. This voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant ; 
for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold dust 
for my adventure, which yielded me in London at my return 
almost £300, and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts 
which have since so completed my ruin. 

I was now set up for a Guinea trader ; and my friend 
dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go the same 
voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel. This was 
the unhappiest voyage that ever man made ; for though I 
did not carry quite £100 of my new-gained wealth, so that 
I had £200 left, and which I lodged with my friend’s 
widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible mis- 
fortunes in this voyage ; and the first was this, viz., our 
ship making her course towards the Canary Islands was 
surprised in the grey of the morning by a Turkish rover of 
Sallee, who gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. 
We crowded also as much canvas as our yards would spread, 
or our masts carry, but the pirate came up with us in a few 
hours. To cut short this melancholy part of our story, our 
ship being disabled, and three of our men killed and eight 
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were carried all 
prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors. 

The captain of the rover made me his slave, being young 
and nimble, and fit for his business, and as he had taken me 
home to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take 
me with him when he went to sea again, believing that it 
would some time or other be his fate to be taken by a 
Spanish or Portugal man-of-war ; and that then I should be 
set at liberty. But when he went to sea, he left me on shore 
to look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery 
of slaves about his house ; and when he came home again 
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look 
after the ship. Here I meditated nothing but my escape, 
and what method I might take to effect it, yet I never had 
the least encouraging prospect of putting it in practice 





ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 15 

until after about two years* My patron lying at home 
longer than usual without fitting out his ship, he used 
constantly to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the 
road a-fishing ; and he always took me and a young Maresco 
with him to row the boat* Sometimes he would send me 
with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth the 
Maresco, to catch a dish of fish for him* 

It happened that he had appointed to go out with two 
or three Moors of some distinction in that place, for whom 
he had provided extraordinarily ; and had therefore 
sent on board overnight a larger store of provisions than 
ordinary* I got all things ready as he had directed, and 
waited the next morning with the boat ; when by and by 
my patron came on board alone, and told me his guests 
had put off going, and ordered me with the man and boy, 
as usual, to go out with the boat and catch them some fish, 
for that his friends were to sup at his house. This moment 
my former notions of deliverance darted into my thoughts, 
and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself, 
not for a fishing business, but for a voyage* 

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to 
this Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board ; 
for I told him we must not presume to eat of our patron's 
bread. He said that was true ; so he brought a large 
basket of rusk or biscuit of their kind, and three jars with 
fresh water, into the boat* I conveyed also a great lump 
of beeswax into the boat, which weighed above half a 
hundredweight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, 
a saw, and a hammer, all which were great use to us after* 
wards, especially the wax to make candles* The castle, 
which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, 
and took no notice of us ; and we were not above a mile 
out of the port before we hauled in our sail, and set us down 
to fish* After we had fished some time and catched 
nothing, for when I had fish on my hook I would not pull 
them up, that he might not see them, I said to the Moor, 



16 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


M This will not do ; our master will not be thus served ; we 
must stand farther off.” He, thinking no harm, agreed. 
Giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to where the 
Moor was, and making as if I stooped for something behind 
him, I took him by surprise with my arm under his twist, 
and tossed him clear overboard into the sea. He rose 
immediately, for he swam like a cork, and called to me, 
begged to be taken in, told me he would go all the world 
over with me. He swam so strong after the boat, that he 
would have reached me very quickly; upon which I stepped 
into the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces, 
I presented it at him, and told him I had done him no hurt, 
and if he would be quiet I would do him none. 44 But,” 
said 1, 44 you swim well enough to reach to the shore, and 
the sea is calm ; make the best of your way to shore, and 
I will do you no harm ; but if you come near the boat I'll 
shoot you through the head, for I am resolved to have my 
liberty.” So he turned himself about, and swam for 
the shore, and I make no doubt but he reached it with ease, 
for he was an excellent swimmer. I could have been 
content to have taken this Moor with me, and have drowned 
the boy, but there was no venturing to trust him. When 
he was gone I turned to the boy, whom they called Xury, 
and said to him, 44 Xury, if you will be faithful to me I'll 
make you a great man ; but if you will not stroke your face 
to be true to me/' that is, swear by Mahomet and his 
father's beard, 44 I must throw you into the sea too.” The 
boy smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I 
could not mistrust him, and swore to be faithful to me, 
and go all over the world with me. 

As soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my 
course, and steered directly south and by east, that I might 
keep in with the shore ; and having a fair, fresh gale of wind, 
and a smooth, quiet sea, I made such sail that I believe by 
the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I first 
made the land, I could not be less than 150 miles south of 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 17 

Sallee ; quite beyond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, 
or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw no 
people* 

I would not go on shore, or come to an anchor, till I had 
sailed five days ; and then the wind shifting to the south- 
ward, I concluded also that if any of our vessels were in 
chase of me, they also would now give over ; so I came to 
an anchor in the mouth of a little river* I neither saw, or 
desired to see, any people ; the principal thing I wanted 
was fresh water* We came into this creek in the evening, 
resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and dis- 
cover the country ; but as soon as it was quite dark we 
heard such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and 
howling of wild creatures, of we knew not what kinds, 
that the poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of 
me not to go on shore till day* 

We were obliged to go on shore somewhere or other 
for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat* Xury said 
if I would let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would 
find if there was any water* I asked him why he would go ( 
why I should not go and he stay in the boat i The boy 
answered with so much affection, that made me love him 
ever after* Says he, 44 If wild mans come, they eat me, 
you go way*" 44 Well, Xury," said I, 44 we will both go ; 
and if the wild mans come, we will kill them, they shall 
eat neither of us*" So I gave Xury a piece of rusk bread 
to eat and a dram out of our patron's case of bottles ; and 
we hauled in the boat as near the shore as we thought was 
proper, and so waded on shore, carrying nothing but our 
arms and two jars for water. The boy seeing a low place 
about a mile up the country, rambled to rt ; and by and by 
I saw him come running towards me* I thought he was 
pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild beast, 
and I ran forward towards him to help him ; but when I 
came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his 
shoulders, which was a creature that he had shot, like a 



18 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

hare, but different in colour, and longer legs. However, 
we were very glad of it, and it was very good meat ; but 
the great joy that poor Xury came with was to tell me he had 
found good water, and seen no wild mans. 

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water; 
and once in particular, being early in the morning, we came 
to an anchor under a little point of land which was pretty 
high ; and the tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go 
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were more about him than 
it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that 
we had best go farther off the shore ; “ For,” says he, " look, 
yonder lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hilloch 
fast asleep.” I looked and saw a great lion that lay on the 
side of the shore, under the shade of a piece of the hill that 
hung as it were a little over him. “ Xury,” says Ij, “ you 
shall go on shore and kill him.” Xury looked frighted, 
and said, ** Me kill 1 he eat me at one mouth.” I said nc 
more but took the best aim I could, but he lay so with his 
leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg 
about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up growling 
at first, but finding his leg broke, fell down again, and then goi 
up upon three legs and gave the most hideous roar that evei 
I heard. I fired again, and shot him into the head, and hac 
the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little noise, bu' 
lay struggling for life. Then Xury took heart, and woulc 
have me let him go on shore. “ Well, go,” said I ; so th< 
boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in on< 
hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and comini 
dose to the creature, put the muzzle of the piece t< 
his ear, and shot him into the head again, which despatchec 
him quite. This was game indeed, but no food ; and I wa 
very sorry to loose three charges of powder and shot upoi 
a creature that was good for nothing. 

I bethought myself that perhaps the skin of him migh 
be of some value to us. So Xury and I went to work witl 
him. It took us both the whole day, but at last we got of 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 19 

the hide of him, and spreading it on the top of our cabin, 
the sun effectually dried it in two days' time, and it after- 
wards served me to lie upon. 

After this stop we made on to the southward for ten or 
twelve days. I began to see that the land was inhabited ; 
and in two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people 
quite black and stark naked stand upon die shore to look 
at us. I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs 
as well as I could, and particularly made signs for some- 
thing to eat. They beckoned to me to stop my boat, and 
that they would fetch me some meat. Upon this two of 
them ran up into the country, and in less than half an hour 
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dried 
flesh and some corn. I was not for venturing on shore to 
them, and they were as much afraid of us ; but they took 
a safe way for us all, for they brought it to the shore and 
laid it down, and went and stood a great way off till we 
fetched it on board. 

I made forward for about eleven days more. On a sudden, 
Xury cried out, “ Master, master, a ship with a sail ! ” 
I jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw that it was 
a Portuguese ship, upon which I stretched out to sea 
as much as I could, resolving to speak with them. I found 
I should not be able to come in their way, but that 
they would be gone by before I could make any signal to 
them ; but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began 
to despair, they, it seems, saw me by the help of their per- 
spective glasses, and shortened sail to let me come up; and 
in about three hours’ time I came up with them. 

It was an inexpressible joy to me that I was thus delivered, 
and I offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return 
for my deliverance. But he generously told me he would 
take nothing from me, but that all I had should be delivered 
safe to me when I came to the Brazils. " For,” says he, 
“ I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be 
glad to be saved myself ; and it may, one time or other, be 



ao ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

my lot to be taken up in the same condition. No, no. 
Seignior Inglese,” says he , 44 Mr. Englishman, I will carry 
you thither in charity, and those things will help you 
to buy your subsistence there, and your passage home 
again.” 

He told me he would buy my boat of me for the ship's 
use, and asked me what I would have for it i I told him 
that I could not offer to make any price of the boat, but 
left it entirely to him ; upon which he told me he would 
give me eighty pieces of eight for it at Brazil. He offered 
me also sixty pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which 
I was loth to take ; not that I was not willing to let the 
captain have him, but I was very loth to sell the poor boy's 
liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my 
own. However, he offered me this medium, that he would 
give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten years if 
he turned Christian. Upon this, and Xury saying he was 
willing to go to him, I let the captain have him. 

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and arrived 
in All Saints' Bay in about twenty-two days. The gener- 
ous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough 
remember. He would take nothing of me for my passage, 
gave me twenty ducats for a leopard’s skin, and forty for 
the lion's skin, and caused everything I had in the ship to 
be punctually delivered me ; and what I was willing to sell 
he bought. I made about 220 pieces of eight of all my 
cargo, and with this stock I went on shore in the Brazils. 
I had not been long here, but being recommended to the 
house of a good honest man like himself, who had an 
ingeino as they call it, that is, a plantation and a sugar- 
house, I lived with him some time, and acquainted myself 
by that means with the manner of their planting and 
making of sugar ; and seeing how well the planters lived, 
and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved I would turn 
planter among them, resolving in the meantime to find out 
some way to get my money, which I had left in London, 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE ai 


remitted to me* To this purpose, I purchased as much 
land that was uncured as my money would reach* 

I had a neighbour in much such circumstances as I was* 
My stock was but low, as well as his ; and we rather planted 
for food than anything else for about two years* How- 
ever, we began to increase, and our land began to come into 
order; so that the third year we planted some tobacco, 
and made each of us a large piece of ground ready for 
planting canes in the year to come* But we both wanted 
help; and now I found, more than before, I had done 
wrong in parting with my boy Xury. 

Before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took 
me up at sea, went back he gave me this friendly advice : 
“ Seignior Inglese,” says he, “ if you will give me letters, 
with orders to the person who has your money in London 
to send your effects to Lisbon, I will bring you the produce 
of them at my return* So I accordingly prepared letters 
to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and 
a procuration to the Portuguese captain as he desired* 
I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all 
my adventures ; and when this honest captain came to 
Lisbon, he found means to send over not the order only, 
but a full account of my story to a merchant at London, who 
represented it effectually to her ; whereupon, she not only 
delivered the money, but out of her own pocket sent the 
Portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity 
and charity to me* The merchant in London vesting this 
hundred pourids in English goods, sent them directly to 
him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to the 
Brazils* My goods being all English manufactures, such 
as cloth, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and 
desirable in the country, I found means to sell them to 
a very great advantage ; so that I may say I had more than 
four times the value of my first cargo, and was now infin- 
itely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advance- 
ment of my plantation ; for the first thing I did, I bought 



22 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


me a negro slave, and an European servant also; I 
mean another besides that which the captain brought 
me from Lisbon. And now, increasing in business 
and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects and 
undertakings. 

You may suppose, that having now lived almost four 
years in the Brazils, I had not only learned the language, 
but had contracted acquaintance and friendship among 
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants at 
St. Salvador, and I had frequently given them an account 
of my two yovages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of 
trading with the negroes there, and how easy it was to 
purchase upon the coast for trifles — such as beads, toys, 
knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like — not 
only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth, etc., but 
negroes, for the service of the Brazils, in great numbers. 
They listened always very attentively, especially to that part 
which related to the buying negroes. It happened three 
of them came to me and told me they had been musing 
very much upon what I had discoursed with them of, and 
they came to make a secret proposal to me. They told me 
that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea ; that 
they had all plantations as well as I, and were straitened 
for nothing so much as servants ; that as it was a trade that 
could not be carried on because they could not publicly 
sell the negroes when they came home, so they desired to 
make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore 
privately, and divide them among their own plantations ; 
and, in a word, the question was, whether I would go their 
supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon the 
coast of Guinea ; and they offered me that I should have my 
equal share of the negroes without providing any part of 
the stock. 

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed. I could no 
more resist the offer than I could restrain my first rambling 
designs, when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 33 

In a word, I told them I would go, if they would undertake 
to look after my plantation in my absence, and would dis- 
pose of it to such as I should direct if I miscarried. This 
they entered into covenants to do. 

The same day I went on board we set sail, and passed 
the line in about twelve days' time, and were in seven 
degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude when a 
violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our 
knowledge. It blew in such a terrible manner that for 
twelve days together we could do nothing but drive 
wherever fate and the fury of the winds directed. 

In this distress, and looking over the charts of the sea- 
coast of America, we concluded there was no inhabited 
country for us to have recourse to till we came within the 
circle of the Carribbee Islands. 

We therefore changed our course, and steered away 
N.W. by W. in order to reach some of our English islands, 
where I hoped for relief ; but our voyage was otherwise 
determined; for a second storm came upon us, which 
carried us away with the same impetuosity westward, and 
drove us so out of the very way of all human commerce, that 
had all our lives been saved, as to the sea, we were rather 
in danger of being devoured by savages than ever returning 
to our own country. 

The wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early in 
the morning cried out, “ Land 1 ” and we had no sooner 
ran out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing where- 
abouts in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a 
sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea 
broke over her in such a manner that we expected we 
should all have perished immediately ; and we were 
immediately driven into our close quarters, to shelter us 
from the very foam and spray of the sea. We knew nothing 
where we were, or upon what land it was we were driven ; 
and as the rage of the wind was still great, we could not so 
much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without 



THEY GOT HER SLUNG OVER THE SHIP'S SIDB 


breaking in pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle, 
should turn immediately about* Contrary to our expecta- 
tion, the ship did not break yet, and though we thought 
that the wind abated a little, yet the ship, having struck upon 
the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting 
off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had 
nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we 
could* We had a boat at our stem just before the storm, 
but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's rudder, 
and in the next place, she broke away, and either sunk or 
was driven off to sea, so there was no hope from her* We 
had another boat on board, which the mate lays hold of 
and, with the help of the rest of the men, got slung over the 
ship's side* Getting all into her we committed ourselves, 
being eleven in number, to God's mercy and the wild sea* 
And now our case was very dismal indeed, for we all saw 
plainly that the boat could not live* The wind driving us 




ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 25 

towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our 
own hands, pulling as well as we could towards land* 
What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or 
shoal, we knew not ; the only hope that could rationally 
give us the least shadow of expectation was, if we might 
happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some river, 
where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or 
got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth 
water* After we had driven about a league and a half, 
a raging wave, mountairi-like, came rolling astern of us, 
and took us with such a fury that it overset the boat at 
once ; and separating us, as well from the boat as from 
one another, gave us not time hardly to say, 44 O God ! ” 
for we were all swallowed up in a moment* 

Though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself 
from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having 
carried me a vast way on towards the shore, and having 
spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost 
dry, but half dead with the water I took in* I had so much 
presence of mind, as well as breath left, that seeing myself 
nearer the mainland than I expected, I got upon my feet 
and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as 
I could, before another wave should return and take me 
up again* But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it ; 
for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and 
as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or strength 
to contend with* My business was to hold my breath, 
and raise myself upon the water, if I could ; and so, by 
swimming, to preserve my breathing, and pilot myself 
towards the shore, if possible ; my greatest concern now 
being, that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards 
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again 
with it when it gave back towards the sea* 

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 
20 or 30 feet deep in its own body, and I could feel myself 
carried with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore 



26 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

a very great way; but I held my breath, and assisted 
myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was 
ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt 
myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I found my 
head and hands shoot out above the surface of the water ; 
and though it was not two seconds of time that I could 
keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath 
and new courage. I was covered again with water a good 
while, but not so long but I held it out ; and finding the 
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck 
forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground 
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover 
breath, and till the water went from me, and then took to my 
heels and ran with what strength I had farther towards the 
shore. But neither would this deliver me from the fury 
of the sea, which came pouring in after me again, and 
twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried for- 
wards as before, the shore being very flat. The last time 
of these two had well near been fatal to me ; for the sea, 
having hurried me along as before, dashed me against a 
piece of a rock, and that with such force as it left me sense- 
less. The blow taking my side and breast beat the breath 
as it were quite out of my body ; and had it returned again 
immediately, I must have been strangled in the water. 
But I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and 
seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved 
to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, 
if possible, till the wave went back. Now as the waves were 
not so high as at first, being near land, I held my hold till 
the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which 
brought me so near the shore that the next wave, though it 
went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me 
away, and the next run I took I got to the mainland, where, 
to my great comfort, I clambered up the cliffs and sat me 
down free from danger. 

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands ; my 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 27 

whole being wrapt up in the contemplation of my deliver- 
ance ; reflecting upon all my comrades that were drowned, 
that there should not be one soul saved but myself ; for 
I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of them, except 
three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not 
fellows* 

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part 
of my condition, I began to look round me to see what kind 
of place I was in, and what was next to be done, and I soon 
found my comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a 
dreadful deliverance ; for I was wet, had no clothes to 
shift me, nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me, 
neither did I see any prospect before me but that of perish- 
ing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts* I had 
nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little 
tobacco in a box* This was all my provision ; and this 
threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I ran 
about like a madman. Night coming upon me, I began 
to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous 
beasts in^that country, seeing at night they always come 
abroad for their prey* All the remedy that offered to my 
thoughts at that time was, to get up into a thick bushy tree 
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and where I 
resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what 
death I should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. 
I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if I could 
find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great 
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my 
mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting 
up into it, endeavoured to place myself so, as that if I should 
sleep I might not fall ; and having cut me a short stick, 
like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging, 
and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done 
in my condition* 

When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and 
the storm abated* But that which surprised me most was, 



38 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where 
she lay, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which 
I first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the 
dashing me against it. This being within about a mile 
from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand 
upright still, I wished myself on board, that, at least, I might 
have some necessary things for my use. 

When I came down from the tree I looked about me 
again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay 
as the wind and the sea had tossed her up upon the land, 
about two miles on my right hand. I walked as far as I 
could upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck 
or inlet of water between me and the boat, which was about 
half a mile broad ; so I came back for the present, being 
more intent upon getting at the ship, where I hoped to 
find something for my present subsistence. A little after 
noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far 
out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the 
ship ; and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief, for 
I saw evidendy, that if we had kept on board we had all 
got safe on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to 
be left entirely destitute of all comfort and company. I 
pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, 
and took the water. But when I came to the ship, my 
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board ; 
for as she lay aground, and high out of the water, there was 
nothing within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round 
her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of a 
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hang down 
by the fore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty I 
got hold of it, and by its help got up into the forecastle. 
Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal 
of water in her hold, but that she lay so on the side of a 
bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that her stern lay lifted 
up upon the bank, and her head low almost to the water. 
By this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 29 

that part was dry* First I found that all the ship's pro- 
visions were untouched by the water ; and being very well 
disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room and filled my 
pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things* 
I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I 
took a large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of 
to spirit me for what was before me* Now I wanted 
nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many things 
which I foresaw would be very necessary to me* And this 
extremity roused my application* We had several spare 
yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare 
top-mast or two in the ship. I flung as many of them 
overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every- 
one with a rope, that they might not drive away* When 
this was done I went down the ship's side, and, pulling 
them to me, I tied four of them fast together at both ends 
in the form of a raft ; and laying two or three short pieces 
of plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon 
it very well, but that it was not able to bear any great 
weight, the pieces being too light* So, with the carpenter's 
saw, I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and added 
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and pains ; 
but hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged 
me to go beyond what I should have been able to do upon 
another occasion* 

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable 
weight* My next care was what to load it with, and how 
to preserve what I laid upon it from the surf of the sea ; 
but I was not long considering this* I first laid all the 
planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having con- 
sidered well what I most wanted, I first got three of the 
seamen's chests, which I had broken open, and emptied, 
and lowered them down upon my raft* The first of these 
I filled with provisions, vis*, bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, 
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, and a little remainder of 
European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls 



3 o ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

which wc brought to sea with us* There had been some 
barley and wheat together, but, to my great disappoint- 
ment, I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled 
it all* As for liquors, I found several cases of bottles 
belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial 
waters, and, in all, about five or six gallons of rack* These 
I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them 
into the chest, nor no room for them* While doing this, 
I found the tide began to flow, though very calm, and I had 
the mortification to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which 
I had left on shore upon the sand, swim away; as for 
my breeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I 
swam on board in them and my stockings* This put me 
upon rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but 
took no more than I wanted for present use ; for I had 
other things which my eye was more upon, as tools to work 
with on shore ; and it was after long searching that I found 
out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful 
prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship-loading 
of gold would have been at that time* I got it down to my 
v raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into 
it, for I knew in general what it contained* 

My next care was for some ammunition and arms; 
there were two very good fowling-pieces in the great 
cabin, and two pistols ; these I secured first, with some 
powder-horns, and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty 
swords* I knew there were three barrels of powder in the 
ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them ; 
but with much search I found them, two of them dry and 
good, the third had taken water ; those two I got to my 
raft with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well 
freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore 
with them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder ; and the 
least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation* 
Having found two or three broken oars belonging to the 
boat, I put to sea* For a mile or thereabouts my raft went 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 31 

very well, only that I found it drive a little distance from 
the place where I had landed before, by which I perceived 
that there was some indraft of the water, and consequently I 
hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might 
make use of as a port. 

As I imagined, so it was ; there appeared before me a 
little opening of the land, and I found a strong current 
of the tide set into it, so I guided my raft as well as I could 
to keep in the middle of the stream. But here I had like 
to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had, I 
think verily would have broke my heart ; for knowing 
nothing of the coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it 
upon a shoal, and not being aground at the other end, it 
wanted but a little that all my cargo had slipped off towards 
that end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water. I 
did my utmost by setting my back against the chests to 
keep them in their places, but could not thrust off the raft 
with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the posture 
I was in, but holding up the chests with all my might, stood 
in that manner near half-an-hour, in which time the rising 
of the water brought me a little more upon a level ; and 
a little after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, 
and I thrust her off with the oar I had into the channel, and 
then driving up higher, I at length found myself in the 
mouth of a little river, with land on both sides, and a 
strong current or tide running up. I looked on both sides 
for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be 
driven too high up the river, hoping in time to see some 
ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near 
the coast as I could. 

At length I spied a litde cove on the right shore of the 
creek, to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my 
raft, and at last got so near that, reaching ground with my 
oar, I could thrust her directly in ; but here I had like to 
have dipped all my cargo in the sea again ; for that shore 
sloping, there was no place to land but where one end of my 



33 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

float, if it run on shore, would lie so high and the other 
sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo 
again. All that I could do was to wait till the tide was at 
the highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor 
to hold the side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of 
ground, which I expected the water would flow over; 
and so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for my 
raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her on upon that 
flat piece of ground, and there moored her by sticking my 
two broken oars into the ground ; one on one side near one 
end, and one on the other side near the other end ; and 
thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all 
my cargo safe on shore. 

There was a hill, not above a mile from me, which rose 
up very steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some 
other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it, northward. I 
took out one of the fowling-pieces and one of the pistols, 
and a horn of powder ; and thus armed, I travelled for 
discovery up to the top of that hill, where I saw my fate 
to my great affliction, viz., that I was environed every way 
with the sea, no land to be seen, except some rocks which 
lay a great way off, and two small islands less than this, 
which lay about three leagues to the west. 

At my coming back, I shot at a great bird which I saw 
sitting upon a tree on the side of a great wood. I believe 
it was the first gun that had been fired there since the 
creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, but from all 
the parts of the wood there arose an innumerable number 
of fowls of many sorts, making a confused screaming. 

I came back to my raft, and brought my cargo on 
shore, which took me up the rest of that day. 
As well as I could, I barricaded myself round with the 
chests and boards and made a kind of a hut for that night’s 
lodging ; as for food, I yet saw not which way to supply 
myself, except that I had seen two or three creatures like 
hares run out of the wood where I shot the fowl. 





My fait went very well 


ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 33 

I resolved to make another voyage on board the vessel; 
if possible. And as I knew that the first storm that blew 
must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to set all 
other things apart till I got everything out of the ship that 
I could get. 

I got on board as before, and prepared a second raft, 
and having had experience of the first, I neither made this 
so unwieldly, nor loaded it so hard ; but yet I brought 
away several things very useful to me ; as, first, in the 
carpenter's stores I found two or three bags full of nails 
and spikes, a great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, 
and above all, that most useful thing called a grindstone. 
All these I secured, together with several things belonging 
to the gunner, particularly two or three iron crows, and 
two barrels of musket bullets, seven muskets, and another 
fowling-piece, with some small quantity of powder more ; 
a large bag full of small-shot, and a great roll of sheet lead ; 
but this last was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to get it 
over the ship's side. Besides these things, I took all the 
men's clothes that I could find, and a spare fore-top sail, a 
hammock, and some bedding. 

When I came back, I found no sign of any visitor, only 
there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests, 
which, when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, 
and then stood still. She sat very composed and uncon- 
cerned, and looked full in my face, as if she had a mind to 
be acquainted with me. I presented my gun at her; 
but as she did not understand it, she was perfectly uncon- 
cerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away ; upon which I 
tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by the way, I was not 
very free of it, for my store was not great. However, I 
spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled of it, 
and ate it, and looked (as pleased) for more ; but I thanked 
her, and could spare no more, so she marched off. 

I went to work to make me a little tent with the sail and 
some poles which I cut for that purpose ; and into this 

c 



34 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

» 

tent I brought everything that I knew would spoil either 
with rain or sun ; and I piled all the empty chests and 
casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from any 
sudden attempt, either from man or beast. When I had 
done this I blocked up the door of the tent with some boards 
within, and an empty chest set up on end without ; and 
spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two 
pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went 
to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night, 
for I was very weary and heavy ; for the night before I had 
slept little, and had laboured very hard all day, as well to 
fetch all those things from the ship, as to get them on shore. 

Every day at low water I went on board, and brought 
away something or other ; but, particularly, the third time 
I went I brought away as much of the rigging as I could, as 
also all the small ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a 
piece of spare canvas and the barrel of wet gunpowder. 
In a word, I brought away all the sails first and last, only 
that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as much 
at a time as I could ; for they were no more useful to be 
sails, but as mere canvas only. After I had made five or 
six such voyages as these, I found a great hogshead of bread, 
and three large runlets of rum or spirits, and a box of 
sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was surprising to me, 
because I had given over expecting any more provisions, 
except what was spoilt by the water. I soon emptied 
the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped it up parcel by 
parcel in pieces of the sails, which I cut out ; and now, 
having plundered the ship of what was portable and fit to 
hand out, I began with the cables ; and cutting the great 
cable into pieces, such as I could move, I got two cables 
and a hawser on shore, with all the iron-work I could get ; 
and having cut down the sprit-sailyard, and the mizzen- 
yard, and everything I could to make a large raft, I loaded 
it with all those heavy goods, and came away. But my 
good luck began now to leave me ; for this raft was so 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 35 

unwieldy, and so overladen, that after I was entered the 
little cove where I had landed the rest of my goods, not 
being able to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset 
and threw me and all my cargo into the water. As for 
myself, it was no great harm, for I was near the shore ; 
but as to my cargo, it was great part of it lost, especially 
the iron, which I expected would have been of great use 
to me. However, when the tide was out, I got most of the 
pieces of cable ashore, and some of the iron, though with 
infinite labour ; for I was fain to dip for it into the water, 
a work which fatigued me very much. 

I had been now thirteen days on shore, and had been 
eleven times on board the ship; in which time I had brought 
away all that one pair of hands could well be supposed 
capable to bring, though I believe verily, had the calm 
weather held, I should have brought away the whole ship 
piece by piece. Though I had rummaged the cabin so 
effectually, yet I discovered a locker in which I found two 
or three razors, and one pair of large scissors, with some 
ten or a dozen of good knives and forks ; in another, I 
found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some 
European coin, some Brazil, some pieces of eight, some 
gold, some silver. I smiled to myself at the sight of this 
money. 44 O drug ! ” said I aloud , 44 what art thou good 
for i Thou art not worth to me, no, not the taking off 
of the ground ; one of those knives is worth all this heap." 
However, upon second thoughts, I took it away. 

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settle- 
ment, particularly because it was upon a low moorish 
ground near the sea, and I believed would not be whole- 
some. I consulted several things in my situation, which 
I found would be proper for me. First, health and fresh 
water. Secondly, shelter from the heat of the sun. 
Thirdly, security from ravenous creatures, whether men or 
beasts. Fourthly, a view to the sea, that if God sent 
any ship in sight I might not lose any advantage for my 



36 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

deliverance, of which I was not willing to banish all my 
expectation yet. 

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain 
on the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little 
plain was steep as a house-side, so that nothing could 
come down upon me from the top ; on the side of this 
rock there was a hollow place, worn a little way in, like the 
entrance or door of a cave ; but there was not really any 
cave, or way into the rock at all. 

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I 
resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was not above an 
hundred yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like 
a green before my door, and at the end of it descended 
irregularly every way down into the low grounds by the 
seaside. It was on the NNW. side of the hill, so that I 
was sheltered from the heat every day, till it came to a W. 
and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which in those countries 
is near the setting. 

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the 
hollow place, which took in about ten yards in its semi- 
diameter from the rock. In this half-circle I pitched two 
rows of strong stakes, driving them into the ground till 
they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being out of 
the ground about five feet and a half, and sharpened on the 
top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from 
one another. 

Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the 
ship, and laid them in rows one upon another, within the 
circle, between these two rows of stakes, up to the top, 
placing other stakes in the inside leaning against them, 
about two feet and a half high, like a spur to a post ; and 
this fence was so strong, that neither man or beast could 
get into it, or over it. This cost me a great deal of time 
and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods, bring 
them to the place, and drive them into the earth. 

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 37 

but by a short ladder to go over the top ; which ladder, 
when I was in, I lifted over after me, and so I was com- 
pletely fenced in, and fortified. Into this fence or fortress 
I carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammunition, and 
stores ; and I made me a large tent, which, to preserve me 
from the rains that in one part of the year are very violent 
there, I made double, viz., one smaller tent within, and 
one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with 
a large tarpaulin, which I had saved among the sails. 
And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had 
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a 
very good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship. 
When I had done this, I began to work my way into the 
rock ; and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down 
out through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the 
nature of a terrace, so that it raised the ground within 
about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave 
just behind my tent, which served me like a cellar to my 
house. 

It happened that a storm of rain falling from a thick dark 
cloud, a sudden flash of lightning, and after that a great clap 
of thunder, surprised me with the thought which darted 
into my mind as swift as the lightning itself. O my powder! 
My very heart sunk within me when I thought, that at one 
blast all my powder might be destroyed, on which, not my 
defence only, but the providing me food, as I thought, 
entirely depended. I was nothing near so anxious about 
my own danger ; though had the powder took fire, I had 
never known who had hurt me. Such impression did this 
make upon me, that after the storm was over I laid aside 
all my works, my building, and fortifying, and applied 
myself to make bags and boxes to separate the powder, 
and keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope that 
whatever might come it might not all take fire at once. 
As to the barrel that had been wet, I did not apprehend any 
danger from that, so I placed it in my new cave, which in 



38 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 



I HAD FREQUENTLY A FAIR MARK 


my fancy I called my kitchen, and the rest I hid up and 
down in holes among the rocks. 

In the interval I went out once, at least, every day with 
my gun, and presently discovered that there were goats 
in the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but 
they were so shy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it 
was the difficultest thing in the world to come at them. 
I observed if they saw me in the valleys, though they were 
upon the rocks, they would run away as in a terrible fright ; 
but if they were feeding in the valleys, and I was upon the 
rocks, they took no notice of me. So afterward I always 
climbed the rocks first to get above them, and then had 
frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made I killed a 
she-goat, which had a little kid by her, which grieved me 
heartily ; but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock 
still by her till I came and took her up ; and not only so, 
but when I carried the old one with me upon my shoulders, 
the kid followed me quite to my enclosure ; upon which I 
laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms, and 
carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame ; 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 39 

but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill it, and eat it 
myself. These two supplied me with flesh a great while, 
for I sparingly ate, and saved my provisions, my bread 
especially. 

It came into my thoughts that I should lose my reckoning 
of time, and should even forget the Sabbath days. To 
prevent this, I cut them upon a large post, in capital 
letters ; and making it into a great cross, I set it up on 
the shore where I first landed, viz., "I came on shore here 
on the 30th of September 1659.” Upon the sides of this 
square post I cut every day a notch with my knife, and 
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and 
every first day of the month as long again as that long one ; 
and thus I kept my calendar. 

Among the many things which I brought out of the 
ship, I got several which I omitted setting down before ; 
as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in 
the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, 
three or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, 
dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation, all 
which I huddled together, whether I might want them or 
no. Also I found three very good Bibles, which came to 
me in my cargo from England. And I must not forget 
that we had in the ship a dog and two cats. I carried both 
the cats with me ; and as for the dog, he jumped out of 
the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day 
after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty 
servant to me many years. I wanted nothing that he could 
fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to me ; 
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he would 
not do. 

The want of proper tools made work go on heavily; 
and it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished 
my little pale or surrounded habitation. The piles or 
stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift, were a long 
time in cutting and preparing in the woods, and more by 



40 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

far in bringing home ; so that I spent sometimes two days 
in cutting and bringing home one of those posts, and a 
third day in driving it into the ground ; for which purpose 
I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at last bethought 
myself of one of the iron crows. 

When I found I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, 
I worked sideways to the right hand into the rock ; and 
then, turning to the right again, worked quite out, and 
made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale or 
fortification. This gave me not only egress and regress, 
as it were a backway to my tent and to my storehouse, but 
gave me room to stow my goods. 

And now I began to apply myself to make such neces- 
sary things as I found I most wanted, as particularly a 
chair and a table ; for without these I was not able to 
enjoy the few comforts I had in the world. I could not 
write or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure 
without a table. I had never handled a tool in my life ; 
and yet in time, by labour, application, and contrivance, 
I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made 
it, especially if I had had proper tools. However, I made 
abundance of things even without tools, and some with no 
more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were 
never made that way before, and that with infinite labour. 

When I had wrought out some boards, I made large 
shelves of the breadth of a foot and a half one over another, 
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and 
iron-work ; and, in a word, to separate everything at large 
in their places, that I might come easily at them. I knocked 
pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all 
things that would hang up ; so that had my cave been to be 
seen, it looked like a general magazine of all necessary 
things ; and I had everything so ready at my hand, that 
it was a great pleasure to me to see all my goods in such 
order, and especially to find my stock of all necessaries so 
great. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 41 

And now it was when I began to keep a journal of every 
day’s employment, until, having no more ink, I was forced 
to leave it off. 

At times the rains hindered me many days, nay, some- 
times weeks together. 

And now in the managing my household affairs I found 
myself wanting in many things. For instance, I could 
never make a cask to he hooped ; I could neither put in the 
heads, or joint the staves so true to one another, as to make 
them hold water. In the next place, I was at a great loss 
for candle ; so that as soon as ever it was dark, which was 
generally by seven o’clock, I was obliged to go to bed. 
I remembered the lump of beeswax with which I made 
candles in my African adventure, but I had none of that 
now. The only remedy I had was, that when I had killed 
a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay, 
which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some 
oakum, I made me a lamp ; and this gave me light, though 
not a clear steady light like a candle. 

In the middle of all my labours it happened, that rum- 
maging my things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted 
before, had been filled with corn for the feeding of poultry, 
not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose, when the 
ship came from Lisbon. What little remainder of corn had 
been in the bag was all devoured by rats, and I saw nothing 
in the bag but husks and dust ; and being willing to have 
the bag for some other use, I shook the husks of corn out of 
it on one side of my fortification, under the rock. It was 
a little before the great rains, just now mentioned, that I 
threw this stuff away, taking no notice of anything, and not 
so much as remembering that I had thrown anything 
there ; when, about a month after, or thereabout, I saw 
some few stalks of something green shooting out of the 
ground, which I fancied might be some plant I had not 
seen ; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished, when, 
after a little longer time, I saw about ten or twelve ears 



43 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

come out, which were perfect green barley of the same 
kind as our European, nay, as our English barley. I care- 
fully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their 
season, which was about the end of June ; and laying up 
every corn, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time 
to have some quantity sufficient to supply me with bread. 
But it was not till the fourth year that I could allow myself 
the least grain of this corn to eat, and even then but spar- 
ingly ; for I lost all that I sowed the first season by not 
observing the proper time ; for I sowed it just before the 
dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as 
it would have done. Besides this barley, there was, as 
above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved 
with the same care, and whose use was of the same kind, 
or to the same purpose, viz., to make me bread, or rather 
food ; for I found ways to cook it without baking, though 
I did that also after some time. 

One morning I found the ship strangely removed. 
The forecastle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved 
up at least six feet ; and the stern, which was broken to 
pieces, and parted from the rest by the force of the sea, 
soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed, as it were, 
up, and cast on one side, and the sand was thrown so high 
on that side next her stern, that whereas there was a great 
place of water before, so that I could not come within a 
quarter of a mile of the wreck without swimming, I could 
now walk quite up to her when the tide was out. 

I went every day to the wreck, and got a great deal of 
pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and two or three 
hundredweight of iron. Every day I worked on the 
wreck, and with hard labour I loosened some things so 
much with the crow, that the first blowing tide several 
casks floated out, and two of the seamen's chests. But 
the wind blowing from the shore, nothing came to land 
that day but pieces of timber, and a hogshead, which had 
some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water and the sand had 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 43 

spoiled it. I continued this work every day to the 15 th of 
June, except the time necessary to get food, which I always 
appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when 
the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed 
out. And by this time I had gotten timber, and plank, 
and ironwork enough to have builded a good boat, if I had 
known how ; and also, I got at several times, and in several 
pieces, near one hundredweight of the sheet lead. 

Going down to the seaside next day I found a large 
tortoise or turtle. This was the first I had seen. I found 
in her three-score eggs ; and her flesh was to me, at that 
time, the most savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in 
my life, having had no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since 
I landed in tins horrid place. 

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months. 
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more par- 
ticular survey of the island itself. I went up the creek 
first, where I brought my rafts on shore, and found, after 
I came about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any 
higher, and that it was no more than a little brook of run- 
ning water, and very fresh and good ; but this being the 
dry season, there was hardly any water in some parts of it. 

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again ; 
and after going something farther than I had gone the day 
before, I found the brook and the savannas began to cease, 
and the country became more woody than before. In this 
part I found different fruits, and particularly I found melons 
upon the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the 
trees. The vines had spread over the trees, and the 
clusters of grapes were just now in their prime, very ripe 
and rich. This was a surprising discovery, and I was 
exceeding glad of them ; but I was warned by my experi- 
ence to eat sparingly of them, remembering that when I was 
ashore in Barbary the eating of grapes killed several of our 
E nglishm en, who were slaves there, by throwing them into 
fluxes and fevers. But I found an excellent use for these 



44 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

grapes : and that was, to cure or dry them in the sun, and 
keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I 
thought would be, as indeed they were, as wholesome as 
agreeable to eat, when no grapes might be had* 

I spent all that evening there and went not back to my 
habitation. In the night, I got up into a tree, where I slept 
well ; and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery, 
travelling near four miles. At the end of this march I came 
to an opening, where the country seemed to descend to 
the west ; and a little spring of fresh water ran the other 
way, that is, due east ; and the country appeared so fresh, 
so green, so flourishing, everything being in a constant 
verdure or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted 
garden. I descended a little on the side of that delicious 
vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure to think 
that this was all my own ; that I was king and lord of all 
this country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession. 

I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, and a 
lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of limes and 
lemons in another place ; and, taking a few of each with 
me, I travelled homeward ; and resolved to come again, 
and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry 
the rest home. 

However, I found that there was no laying them up on 
heaps, and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one 
way they would be destroyed, and the other way they 
would be crushed with their own weight, so I took another 
course ; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, 
and hung them up upon the out-branches of the trees, 
that they might cure and dry in the sun ; and as for the 
limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I could well 
stand under. 

I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my 
time there for the whole remaining part of the month of 
July ; and though, upon second thoughts, I resolved not 
to remove, yet I built me a litde kind of a bower, and sur- 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 45 

rounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double 
hedge as high as I could reach, well staked, and filled 
between with brushwood* And here I lay very secure, 
sometimes two or three nights together, always going over 
it with a ladder, as before ; so that I fancied now I had 
my country house and my sea-coast house ; and this work 
took me up to the beginning of August* About the begin- 
ning of August I had finished my bower, and began to 
enjoy myself* The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had 
hung up were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent 
good raisins of the sun ; so I began to take them down 
from the trees* And it was very happy that I did so, for 
the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and 
I had lost the best part of my winter food ; for I had above 
two hundred large bunches of them. No sooner had I 
taken them all down, and carried most of them home to 
my cave, but it began to rain ; and from hence, which was 
the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day till 
the middle of October, and sometimes so violently that 
I could not stir out of my cave for several days* 

As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began to 
settle, which was about the month of November, I made a 
visit up the country to my bower, where, though I had not 
been some months, yet I found all things just as I left them. 
The circle or double hedge that I had made was not only 
firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out of some 
trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out, and grown 
with long branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots 
the first year after lopping its head* I could not tell what 
tree to call it that these stakes were cut from* I was sur- 
prised, and yet very well pleased to see the young trees grow, 
and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much alike 
as I could. And it is scarce credible how beautiful a 
figure they grew into in three years ; so that though the 
hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, 
yet the trees, for such I might now call them, soon covered 



46 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge under all 
the dry season. This made me resolve to cut some more 
stakes, and make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle 
round my wall (I mean that of my first dwelling), which I 
did ; and placing the trees or stakes in a double row, at 
about eight yards' distance from my first fence, they grew 
presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, 
and afterward served for a defence also. 

I found great occasion of many things which I had no 
way to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant 
application ; particularly, I tried many ways to make 
myself a basket ; but all the twigs I could get for the pur- 
pose proved so brittle, that they would no nothing. It 
came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from whence 
I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as 
the sallows, and willows, and osiers in England, and I 
resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day, I went to my 
country house, as I called it ; and cutting some of the 
smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I 
could desire ; whereupon I came the next time prepared 
with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, 
for there was great plenty of them. During the next 
season I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a 
great many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay 
up anything as I had occasion. And though I did not 
finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently 
serviceable for my purpose. I had no vessels to hold any- 
thing that was liquid, except two runlets, which were 
almost full of rum, and some glass bottles, some of the 
common size, and others which were case-bottles, square, 
for the holding of waters, spirits, etc. I had not so much 
as a pot to boil anything, except a great kettle, which I saved 
out of the ship, and which was too big for such use as I 
desired it, viz*, to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by 
itself. 

I now resolved to travel quite across to the seashore on 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 47 

that side ; so taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a 
larger quantity of powder and shot than usual, with two 
biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of raisins in my pouch for 
my store, I began my journey. When I had passed the 
vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view 
of the sea to the west ; and it being a very clear day, I 
fairly descried land, whether an island or a continent I 
could not tell ; but it lay very high, extending from the 
west to the W.S.W. at a very great distance ; by my guess, 
it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off. 

I caught, after some painstaking, a young parrot, for I 
knocked it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I 
brought it home ; but it was some years before I could 
make him speak. I found in the low grounds hares, as I 
thought them to be, and foxes ; but they differed greatly 
from all the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy 
myself to eat them, though I killed several. But I had 
no need to be venturous, for I had no want of food, and 
of that which was very good too ; especially these three 
sorts, viz., goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise; which, 
added to my grapes, Leadenhall Market could not have 
furnished a table better than I, in proportion to the 
company. 

As soon as I came to the seashore, I was surprised to see 
that I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, 
for here indeed the shore was covered with innumerable 
turtles ; whereas, on the other side, I had found but three 
in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite number of 
fowls of many kinds, some of which I had seen before, and 
many of them very good meat, but such as I knew not the 
names of, except those called penguins. I could have 
shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my 
powder and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a 
she-goat, if I could, which I could better feed on ; and 
though there were many goats here, more than on my side 
the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could 



48 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

come near them, the country being flat and even, and they 
saw me much sooner than when I was on the hill. I con- 
fess this side of the country was much pleasanter than 
mine. I travelled along the shore of the sea towards the 
east, I suppose about twelve miles, and then setting up a 
great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would 
go home again ; and that the next journey I took should be 
on the other side of the island, east from my dwelling, and 
so round till I came to my post again. 

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come 
back into my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed. 
This little wandering journey, without settled place of 
abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own house, 
as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me 
compared to that ; and it rendered everything about me so 
comfortable, that I resolved I would never go a great way 
from it again, while it should be my lot to stay on the 
island. 

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now 
come, and I kept the 30th of September as the anniversary 
of my landing on the island, having now been there two 
years, and no more prospect of being delivered than the 
first day I came there. 

I was, in the months of November and December, expect- 
ing my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured 
or dug up for them was not great ; for, as I observed, my 
seed of each was not above the quantity of half a peck ; 
for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season. 
But now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden 
I found I was in danger of losing it all again by enemies of 
several sorts, which it was scarce possible to keep from it ; 
as, first, the goats and wild creatures which I called hares, 
who, tasting the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and 
day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it 
could get no time to shoot up into stalk. This I saw no 
remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a 





ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 49 

hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, 
because it required speed. However, as my arable land 
was but small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced 
in about three weeks' time, and shooting some of the crea- 
tures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it in the night, 
tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand 
and bark all night long ; so in a little time the enemies 
forsook the place, and the corn grew very strong and well, 
and began to ripen apace. 

But as the beasts ruined me before while my corn was in 
the blade, so the birds were as likely to ruin me now when 
it was in the ear ; for going along by the place to see how 
it throve, I saw my little crop surrounded with fowls, of I 
know not how many sorts, who stood, as it were, watching 
> till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among them, 
for I always had my gun with me. I had no sooner shot, 
but there rose up a little cloud of fowls, which I had not 
seen at all, from among the corn itself. This touched me 
sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would devour 
all my hopes, that I should be starved, and never be able 
to raise a crop at all, and what to do I could not tell. 
I went among it to see what damage was already done, and 
found they had spoiled a good deal of it ; but that as it was 
yet too green for them, the loss was not so great but that 
the remainder was like to be a good crop if it could be 
saved. I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming 
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon all the 
trees about me, as if they only waited till I was gone away. 
I was so provoked, knowing that every grain that they ate 
now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in the con- 
sequence, that I firfed again, and killed three of them. 
This was what I wished for ; so I took them up, and 
served them as we serve notorious thieves in England, 
viz., hanged them in chains, for a terror to others. It is 
impossible to imagine almost that this should have such 
an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come

at the corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the 
island, and I could never see a bird near the place as long 
as my scarecrows hung there* 

About the latter end of December I reaped my crop. 
I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down, 
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could out 
of one of the broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved 
among the arms out of the ship. However, as my first crop 
was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut it down ; 
in short, I reaped it my way ; for I cut nothing off but the 
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, 
and so rubbed it out with my hands ; and at the end of 
all my harvesting, I found that out of my half peck of seed 
I had near two bushels of rice, and above two bushels and 
a half of barley, that is to say, by my guess, for I had no 
measure at that time. 

Within doors, that is, when it rained, and I could not 
go out, I found employment on the following occasions ; 
always observing that all the while I was at work I diverted 
myself with talking to my parret, and teaching him to 
speak, and I quickly learned him to know his own name, 
and at last to speak it out pretty loud , 44 Poll/' which was 
the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by any 
mouth but my own. Now, as I said, I had a great employ- 
ment upon my hands, as follows, vis;., I had long studied, 
by some means or other, to make myself some earthen 
vessels, which indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where 
to come at them. However, considering the heat of the 
climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any such 
clay, I might botch up some such pot as might, being dried 
in the sun, be hard enough and strong enough to bear 
handling. 

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, 
to tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste ; 
what odd, misshapen, ugly things I made ; how many of 
them fell in, and how many fell out, the clay not being stiff 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 51 



WHAT ODD, MISSHAPEN, UGLY THINGS I MADE 


enough to bear its own weight ; how many cracked by 
the over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily ; 
and how many fell in pieces with only removing, as well 
before as after they were dried ; and, in a word, how, after 
having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig it, to temper 
it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make above 
two large earthern ugly things (I cannot call them jars) 
in about two months’ labour. However, as the sun baked 
these two very dry and hard, I lifted them very gently up, 
and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, which 
I had made on purpose for them that they might not break ; 
and as between the pot and the basket there was a little 
room to spare, I stuffed it full of the rice and barley straw, 
and these two pots being to stand always dry, I thought 
would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when the 
corn was bruised. 

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get 
an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, 


5a ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

which none of these could do* It happened after some time, 
making a pretty large fire for cooking my meat, when I 
went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken 
piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as 
hard as a stone, and red as a tile* I was agreeably surprised 
to see it, and said to myself that certainly they might be 
made to bum whole, if they would bum broken* This 
set me to studying how to order my fire, so as to make it 
burn me some pots* I placed three large pipkins, and two 
or three pots in a pile, one upon another, and placed my 
firewood all round it, with a great heap of embers under 
them* I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, 
and upon the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot 
quite through, and observed that they did not crack at all. 
When I saw them clear red, I let them stand in that heat 
about five or six hours, till I found one of them, though it 
did not crack, did melt or run, for the sand which was 
mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat ; so 
I slacked my fire gradually till the pots began to abate of the 
red colour ; and watching them all night, that I might not 
let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very 
good, I will not say handsome, pipkins, and two other 
earthen pots, as hard burnt as could be desired, and one of 
them perfectly glazed with the running of the sand* 

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to 
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would 
bear the fire ; and I had hardly patience to stay till they 
were cold, before I set one upon the fire again, with some 
water in it, to boil me some meat, which it did admirably 
well ; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good 
broth* 

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp 
or beat some com in* I spent many a day to find out a great 
stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, 
and could find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, 
and which I had no way to dig or cut out* So, after a great 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 53 

deal of time lost in searching for a stone, I gave it over, and 
resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood, which I 
found indeed much easier ; and getting one as big as I had 
strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it in the outside 
with my axe and hatchet, and then, with the help of fire, 
and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it. After this, 
I made a great heavy pestle, or beater, of the wood called 
the iron-wood ; and this I prepared and laid by against 
I had my next crop of com, when I proposed to myself to 
grind, or rather pound, my com into meal, to make my 
bread. 

My next difficulty was to make a sieve, or search, to 
dress my meal, and to part it from the bran and the husk, 
without which I did not see it possible I could have any 
bread. This was a most difficult thing, so much as but to 
think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary 
thing to make it ; I mean fine thin canvas or stuff, to search 
the meal through. And here I was at a full stop for many 
months, nor did I really know what to do ; linen I had 
none left, but what was mere rags ; I had goats'-hair, but 
neither knew I how to weave it or spin it; and had I 
known how, here was no tools to work it with. All the 
remedy that I found for this was, that at last I did remember 
I had, among the seamen's clothes which were saved out 
of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin ; and 
with some pieces of these I made three small sieves, but 
proper enough for the work ; and thus I made shift for 
some years. 

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, 
and how I should make bread when I came to have corn ; 
for, first, I had no yeast. As to that part, as there was no 
supplying the want, so I did not concern myself much about 
it ; but for an oven I was indeed in great pain. At length 
I found out an experiment for that also, which was this : 
I made some earthen vessels very broad, but not deep, that 
is to say, about two feet diameter, and not above nine inches 



54 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

deep ; these I burned in the fire, as I had done the other, 
and laid them by ; and when I wanted to bake, I made a 
great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some 
square tiles of my own making and burning also. When 
the firewood was burned pretty much into embers, or live 
coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover 
it all over, and there I let them lie till the hearth was very 
hot ; then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my 
loaf, or loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot upon 
them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to 
keep in and add to the heat. And thus, as well as in the 
best oven in the world, I baked my barley-loaves, and 
became, in litde time, a pastry-cook into the bargain ; 
for I made myself several cakes of the rice, and puddings. 

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up 
most part of the third year of my abode here ; for it is to be 
observed, that in the intervals of these things I had my new 
harvest and husbandry to manage ; for I reaped my corn in 
its season, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid 
it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub 
it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to 
thrash it with. 

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure 
my thoughts run many times upon the prospect of land 
which I had seen from the other side of the island, and I was 
not without secret wishes that I were on shore there, fancy- 
ing that by seeing the mainland, and being in an inhabited 
country, I might find some way or other to convey myself 
farther, and perhaps at last find some means of escape. 
But I made no allowance for the dangers of such a condi- 
tion, and how I might fall into the hands of savages ; that if 
I once came into their power, I should run a hazard more 
than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of 
being eaten ; for I had heard that the people of the Carib- 
bean coasts were cannibals, or man-eaters, and I knew by 
the latitude that I could not be far off from that shore. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 55 

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with 
the shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a 
thousand miles on the coast of Africa ; then I thought I 
would go and look at our ship's boat, which, as I have said, 
was blown up upon the shore a great way, in the storm, 
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she 
did at first, and was turned Almost bottom upward, but no 
water about her as before. This put me upon thinking 
whether it was not possible to make myself a canoe, or 
periagua, such as the natives of those climates make, even 
without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, viz., of the 
trunk of a great tree. I went to work upon this boat the 
most like a fool that ever man did who had any of his senses 
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without deter- 
mining whether I was ever able to undertake it. Not but 
that the difficulty of launching my boat came often into my 
head ; but I put a stop to my own inquiries into it by this 
foolish answer which I gave myself, “ Let's first make it ; I’ll 
warrant I’ll find some way or other to get it along when 
’tis done.” This was a most preposterous method ; but 
the eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went. 
I felled a cedar tree : I question much whether Solomon 
ever had such a one for the building of the Temple at 
Jerusalem. It was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower 
part next the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter 
at the end of twenty-two feet. It was not without infinite 
labour that I felled this tree. I was twenty days hacking 
and hewing at it at the bottom ; I was fourteen more get- 
ting the branches and limbs, and the vast spreading head 
of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe 
and hatchet, and inexpressible labour. After this, it cost 
me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to 
something like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim 
upright as it ought to do. It cost me near three months 
more to clear the inside, and work it so as to make an exact 
boat of it. This I did by mere mallet and chisel, and by 



56 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

the dint of hard labour, till I had brought it to be a very 
handsome periagua, and big enough to have carried six 
and twenty men, and consequently big enough to have 
carried me and all my cargo. 

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely 
delighted with it. The boat was really much bigger than 
I ever saw a canoe or periagua, that was made of one tree, 
in my life. But all my devices to get it into the water 
failed me, though they cost me infinite labour too. It 
lay about one hundred yards from the water, and not more ; 
but the first inconvenience was, it was uphill towards the 
creek. Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved 
to dig into the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity. 
This I began, and it cost me a prodigious deal of pains ; 
but who grudges pains, that have their deliverance in view i 
But when tins was worked through, and this difficulty 
managed, it was still much at one, for I could no more stir 
the canoe than I could the other boat. 

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved 
to cut a dock or canal, to. bring the water up to the canoe, 
seeing I could not bringthe canoe down to the water. Well, 
I began this work ; and when I began to enter into it, and 
calculate how deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the 
stuff to be thrown out, I found that by the number of hands 
I had, being none but my own, it must have been ten or 
twelve years before I should have gone through with it ; 
for the shore lay high, so that at the upper end it must have 
been at least twenty feet deep ; so at length, though 
with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also. This 
grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late, the 
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and 
before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through 
with it. 

My clothes began to decay mightily. As to linen, I 
had none a good while, except some chequered shirts which 
I found in the chests of the other seamen, and which I 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 57 

carefully preserved, because many times I could bear no 
other clothes on but a shirt ; and it was a very great help 
to me that I had, among all the men's clothes of the ship, 
almost three dozen of shirts* There were also several 
thick watch-coats of the seamen's which were left indeed, 
but they were too hot to wear ; and though it is true that 
the weather was so violent hot that there was no need of 
clothes, yet I could not go quite naked, no, though I had 
been inclined to it* The reason why was, I could not bear 
the heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some 
clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my 
skin ; whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some 
motion, and whistling under that shirt, was twofold cooler 
than without it* No more could I ever bring myself to go 
out in the heat of the sun without a cap of a hat* The heat 
of the sun beating with such violence, as it does in that 
place, would give me the headache* Upon those views, 
I began to consider about putting the few rags I had, which 
I called clothes, into some order* I had worn out all the 
waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could 
not make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had 
by me, and with such other materials as I had ; so I set 
to work a-tailoring, or rather, indeed, a-botching, for I 
made most piteous work of it* However, I made shift to 
make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would 
serve me a great while* As for breeches or drawers, I 
made but a very sorry shift indeed till afterward* I should 
mention that I had saved the skins of all the creatures that 
I killed, and I had hung them up stretched out with sticks 
in the sun, by which means some of them were very useful* 
The first thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, 
with the hair on the outside, to shoot off the rain ; and 
this I performed so well, that I made me a suit of clothes 
wholly of these skins, that is to say, a waistcoat, and 
breeches open at knees, and both loose, for they were 
rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm* 



58 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

I must not omit to acknowledge that they were wretchedly 
made ; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor. 
However, they were such as I made very good shift with ; 
and when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of my 
waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry. 

After this I spent a great deal of time and pains to make 
me an umbrella. I was indeed in great want of one. I had 
seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very useful 
in the great heats ; and I felt the heats every jot as great 
here, and greater too, being nearer the equator. Besides, 
as I was obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful 
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I took a world 
of pains at it, and was a great while before I could make 
anything likely to hold : nay, after I thought I had hit the 
way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind. 
The main difficulty I found was to make it to let down. 
I could make it spread ; but if it did not let down too, 
and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but just 
over my head, which would not do. However, at last 
I made one to answer, and covered it with skins, the hair 
upwards, so that it cast off the rains like a penthouse, and 
kept off the sun so effectually, that I could walk out in the 
hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could 
before in the coolest ; and when I had no need of it, could 
close it, and carry it under my arm. 

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely 
composed by resigning to the will of God, and throwing 
myself wholly upon the disposal of His providence. 

I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extra- 
ordinary thing happened to me ; but I lived on in the same 
course, in the same posture and place, just as before. I had 
one labour, to make me a canoe, which at last I finished ; 
so that by digging a canal to it of six feet wide, and four feet 
deep, I brought it into the creek almost half a mile. I was 
near two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in 
hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 59 

Though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it 
was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view 
when I made the first. But as I had a boat, my next 
design was to make a tour round the island. For this pur- 
pose, that I might do everything with discretion and con- 
sideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat, and made a 
sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship’s sail, which 
lay in store, and of which I had a great stock by me. I 
found she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers, 
or boxes, at either end of my boat, to put provisions, 
necessaries, and ammunition, etc., into, to be kept dry, 
either from rain or the spray of the sea ; and a little long 
hollow place I cut in the inside of the boat, where I could 
lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep it 
dry. I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like 
a mast, to stand over my head, and keep the heat of the 
sun off of me, like an awning ; and thus I every now and 
then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never went far 
out, not far from the little creek. But at last, being eager 
to view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved 
upon my tour ; and accordingly I victualled my ship for 
the voyage, putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes I 
should rather call them) of barley bread, an earthen pot 
full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal of, a little bottle 
of rum, half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, 
and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned 
before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests ; these I 
took, one to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the 
night. 

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign, 
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this 
voyage, and I found it much longer than I expected ; for 
though the island itself was not very large, yet when I 
came to the east side of it I found a great ledge of rocks lie 
out above two leagues into the sea, some above water, some 
under it, and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half 



6o ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

a league more ; so that I was obliged to go a great way out 
to sea to double the point. In about an hour I came 
within about a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth 
water, I soon got to land ; and refreshing myself with such 
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, 
under some trees, and laid me down to sleep, being quite 
spent with the labour and fatigue of the voyage. 

I resolved in the morning to make my way westward 
along the shore, to see if there was no creek where I might 
lay up my frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I 
wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts, coast- 
ing the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay, about a 
mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet 
or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my 
boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little dock 
made on purpose for her. Here I put in, and having 
stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about me, 
and see where I was. I soon found I had but a little passed 
by the place where I had been before, when I travelled on 
foot to that shore ; so taking nothing out of my boat but 
my gun and my umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, 
I began my march. The way was comfortable enough after 
such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached my old 
bower in the evening, where I found everything standing 
as I left it. I got over the fence, and laid me down in 
the shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell 
asleep. 

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably, 
and I began seriously to consider what I must do when 
I should have no more powder ; I had, I may tell you, 
in the third year of my being here kept a young kid, and 
bred her up tame. I could never find in my heart to kill her, 
till she died at last of mere age. But being now in the 
eleventh year of my residence, and, my ammunition grow- 
ing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and snare the 
goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 61 

To this purpose, I made snares to hamper them, and I do 
believe they were more than once taken in them ; but my 
tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I always found 
them broken, and my bait devoured* At length I resolved 
to try a pitfall ; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in 
places where I had observed the goats used to feed, and 
over these pits I placed hurdles, of my own making too, 
with a great weight upon them ; and several times I put 
ears of barley and dry rice, without setting the trap, and I 
could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten 
up the corn, for I could see the mark of their feet* At 
length I set three traps in one night, and going the next 
morning, I found them all standing, and yet the bait eaten 
and gone ; this was very discouraging* So I altered my 
trap, and going one morning, found in one of them a large 
old he-goat, and in one of the other three kids* As to the 
old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was so fierce 
I durst not go into the pit to him ; that is to say, to go about 
to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted* So 
I even let him out, and he ran away, as if he had been 
frighted out of his wits* 

Taking the three kids one by one, I tied them with strings 
together, and with some difficulty brought them all home* 
It was a good while before they would feed, but throwing 
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began 
to be tame* And now I found that if I expected to supply 
myself with goat's flesh when I had no powder or shot left, 
breeding some up tame was my only way, when perhaps 
I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep. 
But then it presently occurred to me ’that I must keep 
the tame from the wild, or else they would always run 
wild when they grew up ; and the only way for this was to 
have some enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with 
hedge or pale, to keep them in effectually. I resolved to 
enclose a piece of about 150 yards in length, and 100 yards 
in breadth; which, as it would maintain as many as I 



6a ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

should have in any reasonable time, so, as my flock in- 
creased, I could add more ground to my enclosure. This 
answered my end, and in about a year and half I had a 
flock of about twelve goats, kids, and all ; and in two years 
more I had three and forty, besides several that I took and 
killed for my food. And after that I enclosed five several 
pieces of ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive 
them into, to take them as I wanted, and gates out of one 
piece of ground into another. But this was not all, for 
now I not only had goat's flesh to feed on when I pleased, 
but milk too, a thing which, indeed, in my beginning, I did 
not so much as think of. For now I set up my dairy, and 
had sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day ; and as 
Nature, who gives supplies of food to every creature, 
dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so I, that had 
never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or 
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a great 
many essays, made me both butter and cheese at last, and 
never wanted it afterwards. 

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my 
little family sit down to dinner. There was my majesty, 
the prince and lord of the whole island ; I had the lives of 
all my subjects at my absolute command. I could hang, 
draw, give liberty, and take it away ; and no rebels among 
all my subjects. Then to see how like a king I dined, too, 
all alone, attended by my servants. Poll, as if he had been 
my favourite, was the only person permitted to talk to me. 
My dog, who was now grown very old and crazy, sat always 
at my right hand, and two cats, one on one side the table, 
and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit from 
my hand, as a mark of special favour. 

I was something impatient to have the use of my boat, 
though very loth to run any more hazards ; and therefore 
sometimes I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, 
and at other times I sat myself down contented enough 
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 63 

to go down to the point of the island, where, as I have said, 
in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore 
lay, and how the current set, that I might see what I had 
to do. This inclination increased upon me every day, 
and at length I resolved to travel thither by land, following 
the edge of the shore. I did so ; but had any one in 
England been to meet such a man as I was, it must either 
have frighted them, or raised a great deal of laughter. 
I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, 
with a flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the 
sun from me, as to shoot the rain off from running 
into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these 
climates as the rain upon the flesh, under the clothes. 
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts coming down to 
about the middle of my thighs ; and a pair of open-kneed 
breeches of the same. The breeches were made of the skin 
of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on 
either side, that, like pantaloons, it reached to the middle 
of my legs. Stockings and shoes I had none, but had 
made me a pair of somethings, I scarce know what to call 
them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either 
side like spatterdashes ; but of a most barbarous shape, 
as indeed were all the rest of my clothes. I had on a broad 
belt of goat’s skin dried, which I drew together with two 
thongs of the same, instead of buckles ; and in a kind of a 
frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and a dagger, 
hung a little saw and a hatchet, one on one side, one on the 
other. I had another belt, not so broad, and fastened in 
the same manner, which hung over my shoulder ; and at the 
end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made 
of goat's skin too ; in one of which hung my powder, in the 
other my shot. At my back I carried my basket, on my 
shoulder my gun, and over my head a great clumsy ugly 
goat's-skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the most 
necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun. As for 
my face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as 



64 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

one might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and 
living within nineteen degrees of the equator* My beard 
I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter of a 
yard long ; but as I had both scissors and razors sufficient, 
I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper 
lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan 
whiskers, such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I 
saw at Sallee ; for the Moors did not wear such* 

In this kind of figure I went my new journey, and was 
out five or six days* And having no boat now to take care 
of, I went over the land, a nearer way, to the same height 
that I was upon before ; when, looking forward to the 
point of the rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged 
to double with my boat, I was surprised to see the sea all 
smooth and quiet, no rippling, no motion, no current, any 
more there than in other places. My observation con- 
vinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe the 
ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily 
bring my boat about the island again. But I had such a 
terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the danger 
I had been in, that I took up another resolution, which 
was more safe, though more laborious ; and this was, that 
I would build, or rather make me another periagua or 
canoe ; and so have one for one side of the island, and one 
for the other. 

It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat, 
I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's 
naked foot on the shore, which was very plain to be seen 
in the sand, I stood like one thunderstruck, I listened, 
I looked round me, I could hear nothing, nor see anything* 
I went up to a rising ground, to look farther, I went up the 
shore, and down the shore, but it was all one ; I could 
see no other impression but that one, I went to it again 
to see if there were any more, and to observe if it might not 
be my fancy ; but there was no room for that, for there was 
exactly the very print of a foot — toes, heel, and every part 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 65 

of a foot. How it came thither I knew not, nor could in 
the least imagine. But after innumerable fluttering 
thoughts I came home to my fortification terrified to the 
last degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps, 
mistaking every bush and tree, and fancying every stump 
at a distance to be a man. When I came to* my castle, for 
so I think I called it ever after this, I fled into it like one 
pursued. Whether I went over by the ladder, as first 
contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called 
a door, I cannot remember. I slept none that night. 
I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas of the 
thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to 
myself, even though I was now a great way off it. For how 
should any other thing in human shape come into the 
place i Where was the vessel that brought them i What 
mark was there of any other footsteps i And how was it 
possible a man should come there i 

I presently concluded then, that it must be some of the 
savages of the mainland over against me, who had wandered 
out to sea in their canoes, and, either driven by the currents 
or by contrary winds, had made the island, and had been 
on shore, but were gone away again. 

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was 
very thankful in my thoughts that I was so happy as not to 
be thereabouts at that time, or that they did not see my 
boat, by which they would have concluded that some 
inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have 
searched farther for me. Then terrible thoughts racked 
my imagination about their having found my boat, and 
that there were people here ; and that if so, I should cer- 
tainly have them come again in greater numbers, and 
devour me ; that if it should happen so that they should not 
find me, yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my 
corn, carry away all my flock of tame goats, and I should 
perish at last for mere want. 

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so 

x 



66 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

large as to bring a door through again, which door, as 1 
said, came out beyond where my fortification joined to the 
rock. Upon maturely considering this, therefore, I 
resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the same 
manner of a semi-circle, at a distance from my wall, just 
where I had planted a double row of trees about twelve years 
before, of which I made mention. These trees having been 
planted so thick before, they wanted but a few piles to be 
driven between them, that they should be thicker and 
stronger, and my wall would be soon finished. So that 
I had now a double wall ; and my outer wall was thickened 
with pieces of timber, old cables, and everything I could 
think of, to make it strong, having in it seven little holes, 
about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of 
this I thickened my wall to above ten feet thick, with con- 
tinual bringing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the 
foot of the wall, and walking upon it ; and through the 
seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets. These 
I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that 
held them like a carriage, that so I could fire all the seven 
guns in two minutes' time. This wall I was many a weary 
month a-finishing, and yet never thought myself safe till 
it was done. 

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my 
wall, for a great way every way, as full with stakes, or sticks, 
of the osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as 
they could well stand ; insomuch, that I believe I might set 
in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty large 
space between them and my wall, that I might have room 
to see an enemy, and they might have no shelter from the 
young trees, if they attempted to approach my outer wall. 

Thus in two years’ time I had a thick grove ; and in five 
or six years’ time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing 
so monstrous thick and strong, that it was indeed per- 
fectly impassable ; and no men, of what kind soever, would 
ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 67 

a habitation* As for the way which I proposed to myself 
to go in and out, for I left no avenue, it was by setting two 
ladders, one to a part of the rock which was low, and then 
broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon that ; 
so when the two ladders were taken down, no man living 
could come down to me without mischieving himself; 
and if they had come down, they were still on the outside 
of my outer wall* Thus I took all the measures human 
prudence could suggest for my own preservation ; and it 
will be seen that they were not altogether without reason* 

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my 
other affairs ; for I had a great concern upon me for my 
little herd of goats. Accordingly I spent some time to find 
out the most retired parts of the island ; and I pitched upon 
one which was as private indeed as my heart could wish for. 
It was a little damp piece of ground, in the middle of the 
hollow and thick woods. I immediately went to work with 
this piece of ground, and in less than a month's time I had 
so fenced it round, that my flock, or herd, call it which you 
please, were well enough secured in it. After I had thus 
secured one part of my little living stock, I went about the 
whole island, searching for another private place to make 
such another deposit ; when, wandering more to the west 
point of the island than I had ever done yet, and looking 
out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at a great 
distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one of 
the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship, but I 
had it not about me ; and this was so remote, that I could 
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes 
were not able to hold to look any longer. Whether it was 
a boat or not, I do not know ; but as I descended from the 
hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave it over ; only 
I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass. 

When I was come down the hill to the shore, being the 
S.W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and 
amazed ; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of 



68 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


my mind at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, 
and other bones of human bodies; and particularly, I 
observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a 
circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where it is supposed 
the savage wretches had sat down to their inhuman feast- 
ings upon the bodies of their fellow-creatures* I was so 
astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained 
no notion of any danger to myself from it for a long while. 
All my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such 
a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of 
the degeneracy of human nature, which, though I had heard 
of often, yet I never had so near a view of before. In 
short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle. 
I got me up the hill again with all the speed I could, and 
walked on towards my own habitation. 

And then recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost 
affection of my soul, and gave God thanks, that had cast 
my first lot in a part of the world where I was distinguished 
from such dreadful creatures as these. 

I began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my 
circumstances ; for I observed that these wretches never 
came to this island in search of what they could get ; 
perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any- 
thing here ; and having often, no doubt, been up in the 
covered, woody part of it, without finding anything to 
their purpose. I knew I had been here now almost eigh- 
teen years, and never saw the least footsteps of human 
creature there before ; and I might be here eighteen more 
as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover 
myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion to do ; 
it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed 
where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than 
cannibals to make myself known to. Yet I entertained 
such an abhorrence of the savage wretches, that I continued 
pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle for 
almost two years after this. 





ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 69 

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in 
no danger of being discovered by these people, began to 
wear off my uneasiness about them ; and I began to live 
just in the same composed manner as before ; only with 
this difference, that I used more caution, and particularly 
I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of them being 
on the island should happen to hear of it. And it was, there- 
fore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished 
myself with a tame breed of goats, that I needed not hunt 
any more about the woods, or shoot at them. So that 
for two years after this I believe I never fired my gun once 
off, though I never went out without it ; and, which was 
more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I always 
carried them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking 
them in my goat's-skin belt. Also I furbished up one of the 
great cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a 
belt to put it on also; so that I was now a most formidable 
fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the 
former description of myself the particular of two pistols 
and a great broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but 
without a scabbard. 

My boat and everything that I had left belonging to 
her I removed from the other side of the island, that 
there might not be the least shadow of any discovery of 
any human habitation upon the island. 

I believe the reader of this will not think strange if I 
confess that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived 
in, and the concern that was now upon me, put an end to 
all invention, and to all the contrivances that I had laid for 
my future accommodations and conveniences. I cared not 
to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the 
noise I should make should be heard ; much less would I 
fire a gun, for the same reason ; and, above all, I was 
intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest the smoke, 
which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray 
me ; and for this reason I removed that part of my business 



70 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

which required fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, etc*, 
into my new apartment in the woods ; where, after I had 
been some time, I found, to my unspeakable consolation, 
a natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way, and 
where, I dare say, no savage would be so hardy as to 
venture in ; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who, 
like me, wanted a safe retreat* The mouth of this hollow 
was at the bottom of a great rock, where I was cutting down 
some thick branches of trees to make charcoal* The reason 
of my making this charcoal was that I was afraid of making 
a smoke about my habitation, as I said before ; and yet 
I could not live there without baking my bread, cooking 
my meat, etc* So I contrived to burn some wood here, as 
I had seen done in England under turf, till it became chark, 
or dry coal ; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the 
coal to perform the other services which fire was wanting 
for at home, without danger of smoke* While I was 
cutting down some wood here, I perceived that behind 
a very thick branch of low brushwood, or underwood, 
there was a kind of hollow place. I was curious to look 
into it ; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, 
I found it was pretty large ; that is to say, sufficient for 
me to stand upright in. But I must confess to you I made 
more haste out than I did in when, looking farther into the 
place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad 
shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or man I 
knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light from 
the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the reflec- 
tion* But plucking up my spirits as well as I could, 
I stepped forward again, and by the light of a firebrand, 
holding it up a little over my head, I saw lying on the ground 
a most monstrous, frightful, old he-goat, just making his 
will, as we say, and gasping for life ; and dying, indeed, of 
mere old age* I stirred him a little to see if I could get 
him out, and he essayed to get up, but was not able to raise 
himself; and I thought with myself he might even lie 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 71 

there ; for if he had frighted me so, he would certainly 
fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy 
as to come in there while he had any life in him* I was 
now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round 
me, when I found the cave was but very small ; that is to 
say, it might be about twelve feet over* I observed also 
that there was a place at the farther side of it that went 
in farther, but was so low, that it required me to creep upon 
my hands and knees to go into it, and whither I went I 
knew not ; so having no candle, I gave it over for some time, 
but resolved to come again the next day, provided with 
candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock of 
one of the muskets, with some wild-fire in the pan* Accord- 
ingly the next day I came provided with six large candles 
of goat's tallow ; and going into this low place upon all 
fours, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near 
twenty feet. But never was such a glorious sight as it was 
to look round the sides and roof of this vault or cave ; the 
walls reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my 
two candles* 

It was a place of security, and such a retreat as I wanted. 
I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without 
any delay, to bring some of those things which I was most 
anxious about to this place ; particularly my magazine of 
powder, and all my spare arms. 

I persuaded myself, while I was here, if five hundred 
savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out. 
The old goat died in the mouth of the cave the next day* 

It was now the month of December, in my twenty-third 
year ; and the particular time of my harvest, and required 
my being much abroad in the fields ; when, going out early, 
even before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with 
seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at a distance 
from me of about two miles, towards the end of the island 
where I had observed some savages had been, as before ; 
but not on the other side ; but, to my great affliction, it was 



72 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

on my side of the island’* I was indeed terribly surprised 
at the sight, and stopped short within my grove, not daring 
to go out, lest I might be surprised* I went back directly 
to my castle, pulled up the ladder after me, and made all 
things without look as wild and natural as I could* Then 
I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of 
defence* I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, and 
all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last 
gasp ; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the 
Divine protection. And in this posture I continued about 
two hours ; but began to be mighty impatient for intelli- 
gence abroad, for I had no spies to send out* After sitting 
a while thus, and musing what I should do in this case, 
I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance any longer ; so 
mounting to the top of the hill, and pulling out my 
perspective-glass, I laid me down flat on my belly on the 
ground, and began to look for the place* I presently found 
there was no less than nine naked savages sitting round a 
small fire they had made, not to warm them, for they had 
no need of that, the weather being extreme hot, but, as I 
supposed, to dress some of their barbarous diet of human 
flesh which they had brought with them, whether alive or 
dead, I could not know* They had two canoes with them, 
which they had hauled up upon the shore ; and as it was 
then tide of ebb, they seemed to me to wait for the return 
of the flood to go away again* As I expected, so it proved ; 
for as soon as the tide made to the westward, I saw them 
all take boat, and row away* I should have observed, that 
for an hour and more before they went off, they went to 
dancing ; and I could easily discern their postures and 
gestures by my glasses* 

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two 
guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and 
my great sword by my side, without a scabbard, and with 
all the speed I was able to make I went away to the hill 
where I had discovered the first appearance of all* And 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 73 

as soon as I gat thither, which was not less than two hours 
(for I could not go apace, being laden with arms), I per- 
ceived there had been three canoes more of savages on that 
place ; and looking out farther, I saw they were all at sea 
together, making over for the main. This was a dreadful 
sight to me, especially when, going down to the shore, 

I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they 
had been about had left behind it, viz., the blood, the bones, 
and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured 
by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so 
filled with indignation at the sight, that I began now to 
premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, 
let them be who or how many soever. 

The perturbation of my mind, during the next fifteen or 
sixteen months' interval, was very great. I slept unquiet, 
dreamed always frightful dreams, and often started out of 
my sleep in the night. But, to waive all this for a while, it 
was in the middle of May when I was surprised with a 
noise of a gun, as I thought, fired at sea. I started up in 
the greatest haste imaginable, and, in a trice, got to the top 
of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen 
for a second gun, which accordingly, in about half a minute, 
I heard ; and, by the sound, knew that it was from that 
part of the sea where I was driven down the current in my 
boat. I immediately considered that this must be some 
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some 
other ship in company, and fired these guns for signals of 
distress, and to obtain help, so I brought together all the 
dry wood I could get at hand, and, making a good handsome 
pile, I set it on fire upon the hill. As soon as ever my fire 
blazed up I heard another gun, and after that several others, 
all from the same quarter. I plied my fire all night long till 
day broke ; and when it was broad day, and the air cleared 
up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full east of 
the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, 
no, not with my glasses, the distance was so great, and the 



74 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

weather still something hazy also ; at least it was so out at 
sea* I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon 
perceived that it did not move ; so I presently concluded 
that it was a ship at an anchor* And being eager, you may 
be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand and ran 
toward the south side of the island, to the rocks ; and get- 
ting up there, the weather by this time being perfectly 
clear, I could plainly see the wreck of a ship, cast away 
in the night upon those concealed rocks which I found when 
I was out in my boat* Thus, what is one man's safety is 
another man's destruction ; for it seems these men, who- 
ever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks 
being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in 
the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and E.N.E. Had 
they seen the island, as I must necessarily suppose they did 
not, they must have endeavoured to have saved themselves 
on shore by the help of their boat. 

44 Oh that there had been but one or two, nay, or but one 
soul, saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me, that I 
might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature, 
to have spoken to me, and to have conversed with ! ” In 
all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest, so 
strong a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, 
or so deep a regret at the want of it. I had only the 
affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of a drowned 
boy come on shore at the end of the island which was next 
the shipwreck. In his pocket were two pieces of eight and 
a tobacco-pipe. The last was to me of ten times more 
value than the first. 

I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this 
wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board 
that might be useful to me. But that did not altogether 
press me so much as the possiblity that there might be yet 
some living creature on board, whose life I might not only 
save, but might by saving that life, comfort my own to the 
last degree* 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 75 

I prepared everything for my voyage* Having a strong 
steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly 
for the wreck, and in less than two hours I came up to it. 
It was a dismal sight to look at. The ship, which, 
by its building, was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed in 
between two rocks. All the stern and quarter of her 
was beaten to pieces with the sea ; and as her fore- 
castle had run on with great violence, her mainmast and 
foremast were broken short off ; but her bowsprit was 
sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I 
came close to her a dog appeared, who, seeing me, yelped 
and cried ; and as soon as I called him, jumped into the sea, 
and I took him into the boat, but found him almost dead 
for hunger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread, 
and he ate it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving 
a fortnight. I then gave the poor creature some fresh 
water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have 
burst himself. After this I went on board ; but the 
first sight I met with was two men drowned in the cook- 
room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about 
one another. 

Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that 
had life ; nor any goods that I could see, but what were 
spoiled by the water. There were some casks of liquor, 
whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in 
the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could see ; 
but they were too big to meddle with. I saw several chests, 
and I got two of them into the boat, without examining 
what was in them. Had the stern of the ship been fixed, 
and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have 
made a good voyage ; for by what I found in these two 
chests, I had room to suppose the ship had a great deal of 
wealth on board. 

When I came to open the chests, I found in one a fine 
case of bottles filled with cordial waters, two pots of sweet- 
meats, some very good shirts, and about a dozen and a half 



76 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

of linen white handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths. 
Besides this, I found three great bags of pieces of eight, 
which held out about eleven hundred pieces in all ; and 
in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six doubloons of 
gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold. I suppose 
they might all weigh near a pound. The other chest I 
found had some clothes in it. As to the money, I had no 
manner of occasion for it. I found in this seaman's chest 
about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but no gold. 

Having brought all my things bn shore, I made the best 
of my way to my old habitation, where I found everything 
safe and quiet. So I began to repose myself, live after my 
old fashion, and take care of my family affairs : and I lived 
in this condition near two years more. 

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, 
the four and twentieth year of my first setting foot in this 
island of solitariness. I was lying in my bed, or hammock, 
awake. I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, 
or by abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this 
island, and also of the part of my life since I came to this 
island. My head was for some time taken up in consider- 
ing the nature of the savages, and how it came to pass in 
the world that the wise Governor of all things should give 
up any of His creatures to such inhumanity ; nay, to some- 
thing so much below even brutality itself, as to devour its 
own kind. It occurred to me to inquire what part of the 
world these wretches lived in i how far off the coast was 
from whence they came t what they ventured over so far 
from home for i what kind of boats they had i and why 
I might not order myself and my business so, that I might 
be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me. 
I never so much as troubled myself to consider what I 
should do with myself when I came thither ; what would 
become of me, if I fell into the hands of the savages ; or 
how I should escape from them, if they attempted me. 

About a year and half after I had entertained these 




Killed him at the first shot.'* 


ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 77 

notions, and by long musing had, as it were, resolved them 
all into nothing, I was surprised, one morning early, with 
seeing no less than five canoes all on shore together on my 
side the island, and the people who belonged to them 
all landed, and out of my sight. Seeing so many, and 
knowing that they always came four, or six, or sometimes 
more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or 
how to take my measures to attack twenty or thirty men 
single-handed ; so I lay still in my castle, perplexed 
and discomforted. However, I put myself into all the 
same postures for an attack that I had formerly provided, 
and was ready for action if anything had presented. 
Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they made 
any noise, at length, being very impatient, I set my guns 
at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of 
the hill, standing so, however, that my head did not appear 
above the hill, so that they could not perceive me by any 
means. Here I observed, by the help of my perspective 
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number, that 
they had a fire kindled, that they had had meat dressed. 
How they had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was ; 
but they were all dancing, in I know not how many bar- 
barous gestures and figures, their own way, round the fire. 

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my 
perspective two miserable wretches dragged from the 
boats, where, it seems, they were laid by, and were now 
brought out for the slaughter. I perceived one of them 
immediately fell, being knocked down, I suppose, with a 
club or wooden sword, and two or three others were at 
work immediately, cutting him open for their cookery, 
while the other victim was left standing by himself, till 
they should be ready for him. In that very moment this 
poor wretch seeing himself a little at liberty. Nature 
inspired him with hopes of life, and he started away from 
them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the sands 
directly towards me, I mean towards that part of the 



78 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

coast where my habitation was* I was dreadfully frighted 
when I perceived him to run my way, and especially when, 
as I thought, I saw him pursued by the whole body. 
I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover when 
I found that there was not above three men that followed 
him ; and still more was I encouraged when I found that 
he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and gained 
ground of them ; so that if he could but hold it for half- 
an-hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all. 
There was between them and my castle the creek, and this 
I saw plainly he must necessarily swim over, or the poor 
wretch would be taken there. But he made nothing of it, 
though the tide was then up ; but plunging in, swam 
through in about thirty strokes or thereabouts, landed, and 
ran on with exceeding strength and swiftness. When the 
three persons came to the creek, I found that two of them 
could swim, but the third could not, and that, standing on 
the other side, he looked at the other, but went no further, 
and soon after went softly back, which, as it happened, was 
very well for him in the main. 

I observed that the two who swam were yet more than 
twice as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was 
that fled from them. It came now very warmly upon my 
thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was my time 
to get me a servant, and perhaps a companion or assistant, 
and that I was called plainly by Providence to save this 
poor creature's life. I immediately ran down the ladders 
with all possible expedition, fetched my two guns, and 
getting up again, with the same haste, to the top of the hill, I 
crossed toward the sea, and having a very short cut, and 
all down hill, clapped myself in the way between the pursuers 
and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, 
looking back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as 
at them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; 
and, in the meantime, I slowly advanced towards the two 
that followed ; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 79 

knocked him down with the stock of my piece. I was loth 
to fire, because I would not have the rest hear. Having 
knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued with him 
stopped, as if he had been frighted, and I advanced apace 
towards him ; but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he 
had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I 
was then necessitated to shoot at him first, which I did, 
and killed him at the first shot. 

The poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he 
saw both his enemies fallen and killed, as he thought, yet 
was so frighted with the fire and noise of my piece, that he 
stood stock-still, and neither came forward or went back- 
ward, though he seemed rather inclined to fly still, than to 
come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come 
forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, 
then stopped again, and then a little further, and stopped 
again ; and I could then perceive that he stood trembling, 
as if he also were about to be killed. I beckoned him again, 
and gave him all the signs of encouragement that I could 
think of ; and he came nearer and nearer, kneeling down 
every ten or twelve steps. I smiled at him, and looked 
pleasantly. At length he came close, kneeled down, kissed 
the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his 
head. This, it seems, was in token of swearing to be my 
slave for ever. I took him up, and made much of him, and 
encouraged him all I could. Upon this he spoke some 
words to me ; and though I could not understand them, 
yet I thought they were pleasant to hear ; for they were the 
first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own 
excepted, for above twenty-five years. The savage who 
was knocked down recovered himself so far as to sit upon 
the ground, and I perceived that my savage began to be 
afraid ; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece 
at the man, as if I would shoot him. Upon this my savage, 
for so I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my 
sword, which hung naked in a belt by my side ; so I did. 



80 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

He no sooner had it but he runs to his enemy, and, at one 
blow, cut off his head cleverly; which I thought very strange 
for one who, I had reason to believe, never saw a sword in 
his life before, except their own wooden swords* When 
he had done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of 
triumph, and brought me the sword again, and with abun- 
dance of gestures, laid it down, with the head of the savage 
that he had killed, just before me* But that which 
astonished him most, was to know how I had killed the 
other Indian so far off; so pointing to him, he made 
signs to me to let him go to him ; so I bade him go, as well 
as I could* When he came to him, he stood like one amazed, 
looking at him, turned him first on one side, then on 
t'other, looked at the wound the bullet had made, which, 
it seems, was just in his breast, where it had made a hole* 
He took up his bow and arrows, and came back ; so I 
turned to go away, and beckoned to him to follow me, 
making signs to him that more might come after them. 
Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them with 
sand, that they might not be seen by the rest if they fol- 
lowed ; and so I made signs again to him to do so* He 
fell to work, and in an instant he had scraped a hole in the 
sand with his hands big enough to bury the first in, and 
then dragged him into it, and covered him, and did so also 
by the other* I believe he had buried them both in a 
quarter of an hour. Then calling him away, I carried 
him, not to my castle, but quite away to my cave on the 
farther part of the island* 

Here I gave him bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and 
a draught of water, which I found he was indeed in great 
distress for, by his running ; and having refreshed him, I 
made signs for him to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a 
place where I had laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and 
a blanket upon it ; so the poor creature laid down and went 
to sleep* He was a comely, handsome fellow, perfectly 
well made, with straight strong limbs, not too large, tall, 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE Si 

and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-six years 
of age* He had a very good countenance, not a fierce 
and surly aspect, but seemed to have something very manly 
in his face ; and yet he had all the sweetness and softness 
of an European in his countenance too, especially when he 
smiled* His hair was long and black, not curled like wool ; 
his forehead very high and large ; and a great vivacity in 
his eyes* The colour of his skin was very tawny ; and yet 
not of an ugly, yellow, nauseous tawny, but of a bright kind 
of a dun olive colour, that had in it something very agree- 
able, though not very easy to describe. His face was 
round and plump ; his nose small, not flat like the negroes ; 
a very good mouth, thin lips, and his fine teeth well set, and 
white as ivory. 

In a little time I began to speak to him, and teach him to 
speak to me ; and, first, I made him know his name should 
be Friday, which was the day I saved his life. I likewise 
taught him to say master, and then let him know that was 
to be my name* I gave him some milk in an earthen pot, 
and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my bread 
in it ; and I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which 
he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was very 
good for him* I kept there with him all that night ; but 
as soon as it was day, I beckoned to him to come with me, 
and let him know I would give him some clothes ; at which 
he seemed very glad, for he was stark naked* As we went 
by the place where he had buried the two men, he pointed 
exactly to the place, and showed me the marks that he had 
made to find them again, making signs to me that we should 
dig them up again, and eat them. At this I appeared very 
angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would 
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand 
to him to come away ; which he did immediately, with 
great submission* I then led him up to the top of the hill, 
to see if his enemies were gone ; and pulling out my 
glass, I looked, and saw plainly that they were gone, and 

F 



8a ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

had left their two comrades behind them, without any 
search after them. 

Having now more courage, and consequently more 
curiosity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him the 
sword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at his back, 
which I found he could use very dexterously, making him 
carry one gun for me, and I two for myself, and away we 
marched to the place where these creatures had been. 
When I came to the place, my very blood ran chill in my 
veins, and my heart sunk within me, at the horror of the 
spectacle. The place was covered with human bones, 
the ground dyed with their blood, great pieces of flesh left 
here and there, half-eaten, mangled, and scorched ; and, 
in short, all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had 
been making there, after a victory over their enemies. 
Friday, by lus signs, made me understand that there had 
been a great battle between them and their next king, 
whose subjects it seems he had been one of, and that they 
had taken a great number of prisoners ; all which were 
carried to several places by those that had taken them 
in the fight, in order to feast upon them. 

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, 
and whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, 
and make a great fire upon it, and burn diem all to ashes. 

When we had done this we came back to our castle, and 
there I fell to work for my man Friday ; and, first of all, I 
gave him a pair of linen drawers. Then I made him a 
jerkin of goat’s skin, as well as my skill would allow ; and I 
gave him a cap, which I had made of a hare-skin, very 
convenient and fashionable enough ; and thus he was 
clothed for the present tolerably well, and was mighty well 
pleased to see himself almost as well clothed as his master. 
It is true he went awkwardly in these things at first ; but 
a little easing them where he complained they hurt him, 
and using himself to them, at length he took to them 
very well. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 83 

The next day after I came home to my hutch with him, 
I made a little tent for him in the vacant place between 
my two fortifications ; and as there was a door or entrance 
there into my cave, I made a door to it of boards, and set it 
up in the passage, a little within the entrance ; and causing 
the door to open on the inside, I barred it up in the night, 
taking in my ladders too ; so that Friday could no way 
come at me in the inside of my innermost wall without 
making so much noise in getting over, that it must needs 
waken me ; for my first wall had now a complete roof over 
it of long poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the 
side of the hill, which was again laid cross with smaller 
sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great 
thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong, like reeds ; 
and at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by 
the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-door, which, if it 
had been attempted on the outside, would not have opened 
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a great noise ; 
and as to weapons, I took them all into my side every night. 

But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never man 
had a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was 
to me ; without passions, sullenness, or designs, perfectly 
obliged and engaged ; his very affections were tied to me, 
like those of a child to a father ; and I dare say he would 
have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon any 
occasion whatsoever. 

He was the aptest scholar that ever was ; and particularly 
was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when 
he could but understand me, or make me understand him, 
that it was very pleasant to me to talk to him. And now 
my life began to be so easy, that I began to say to myself, 
that could I but have been safe from more savages, I cared 
not if I was never to remove from the place while I lived. 

I believe, if I would have let him, Friday would have 
worshipped me and my gun. As for the gun itself, he 
would not so much as touch it for several days, but would 



84 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when 
he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of 
him, was to desire it not to kill him. 

I set him to work to beating some corn out, and sifting it 
in the manner I used to do, as I observed before ; and he 
soon understood how to do it as well as I, especially after 
he had seen what the meaning of it was, and that it was to 
make bread of ; for after that I let him see me make my 
bread, and bake it too ; and in a little time Friday was able 
to do all the work for me, as well as I could do it myself. 

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this 
place. Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand 
the names of almost everything I had occasion to call for, 
and of every place I had to send him to, and talked a great 
deal to me ; so that, in short, I began now to have some use 
for my tongue again, which, indeed, I had very little 
occasion for before, that is to say, about speech. Besides 
the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular satisfaction 
in the fellow himself. His simple, unfeigned honesty 
appeared to me more and more every day, and I began 
really to love the creature ; and, on his side, I believe he 
loved me more than it was possible for him ever to love 
anything before. 

I asked him how far it was from our island to the shore, 
and whether the canoes were not often lost. He told me 
there was no danger, no canoes ever lost ; but that, after a 
little way out to the sea, there was a current and a wind, 
always one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon. 
This I understood to be no more than the sets of the tide, 
as going out or coming in. He told me all he knew, with 
the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the 
names of the several nations of his sort of people, but could 
get no other name than Caribs ; from whence I easily 
understood that these were the Caribbees. He told me 
that up a great way beyond the moon, that was, beyond 
the setting of the moon, which must be W. from their 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 85 

country, thcrcdwdt white-bearded men, like me, and pointed 
to my great whiskers, and that they had killed much mans, 
that was his word ; by all which I understood he meant 
the Spaniards, whose cruelties in America had been spread 
over the whole countries, and was remembered by all the 
nations from father to son* I inquired if he could tell me 
how I might come from this island and get among those 
white men* He told me, 44 Yes, yes, I might go in two 
canoe*” He meant it must be in a large great boat, as 
big as two canoes. 

After Friday and I became more intimately acquainted, 
and he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak 
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him 
with my own story, or at least so much of it as related to my 
coming into the place ; how I had lived there, and how 
long* I let him into the mystery, for such it was to him, of 
gunpowder and bullet, and taught him how to shoot ; I 
gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, 
and I made him a belt, with a frog hanging to it, such as in 
England we wear hangers in ; and in the frog, instead of a 
hanger, I gave him a hatchet, which was not only as good a 
weapon, in some cases, but much more useful upon other 
occasions* I described to him the country of Europe, and 
particularly England, which I came from ; how we lived, 
how we worshipped God, how we behaved to one another, 
and how we traded in ships to all parts of the world* 
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we 
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength 
then, but was now fallen almost all to pieces* Upon seeing 
this boat, Friday stood musing a great while, and said 
nothing* I asked him what it was he studied upon* At 
last says he, 44 Me see such boat like come to place at my 
nation*” I did not understand him a good while ; but 
at last I understood by him that a boat such as that had 
been, came on shore upon the country where he lived ; 
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of 



86 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

weather. Friday described the boat to me well enough ; 
but brought me better to understand him when he added 
with some warmth, “We save the white mans from 
drown/' Then I presently asked him if there was any 
white mans, as he called them, in the boat. “ Yes,” he 
said, " the boat full of white mans.” He told upon his 
fingers seventeen. I asked him then what became of 
them. He told me, “ They live, they dwell at my nation.” 

This put new thoughts into my head ; for I presently 
imagined that these might be the men belonging to the 
ship that was cast away in sight of my idand, and had 
saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon that 
wild shore among the savages. He assured me they lived 
still there ; that they had been there about four years ; 
that the savages let them alone, and gave them victuals to 
live. I asked him how it came to pass they did not kill 
them, and eat them. He said, “ No, they make brother 
with them ; ” that is, as I understood him, a truce ; and 
then he added, “ They no eat mans but when make the 
war fight.” 

It was after this some considerable time, that being on 
the top of the hill, at the east side of the island, Friday, the 
weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards the 
mainland, and, in a kind of surprise, falls a-jumping and 
dancing, and calls out to me, for I was at some distance 
from him. I asked him what was the matter i “ O joy 1 ” 
says he, “ O glad 1 there see my country, there my nation 1 ” 
I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in 
his face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance dis- 
covered a strange eagerness, as if he had a mind to be in his 
own country again ; and this observation of mine put a 
great many thoughts into me, which made me at first not 
so easy about my new man Friday as I was before ; and 
I made no doubt but that if Friday could get back to his 
own nation again, he would forget all his obligation to me, 
and would be forward enough to give his countrymen an 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 87 

account of me, and come back perhaps with a hundred or 
two of them, and make a feast upon me, at which he might 
be as merry as he used to be with those of his enemies. 
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for 
which I was very sorry afterwards. 

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being 
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I called 
to him, and said, “ Friday, do not you wish yourself in your 
own country, your own nation?"' “ Yes," hesaid, “ I be much 

0 glad to be at my own nation." “ What would you do 
there i " said I. “ Would you turn wild again, eat men’s 
flesh again, and be a savage as you were before i ” He 
looked full of concern, and shaking his head said, “ No, no ; 
Friday tell them to live good ; tell them to pray God ; tell 
them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk, no eat man 
again." “ Why then," said I to him, “ they will kill you." 
He looked grave at that, and then said, " No, they no kill me, 
they willing love learn.” He meant by this they would be 
willing to learn. He added, they learned much of the 
bearded mans that come in the boat. Then I asked him 
if he would go back to them i He smiled at that, and told 
me he could not swim so far. I told him I would make a 
canoe for him. He told me he would go, if I would go 
with him. “ I go 1 " says I ; “ why, they will eat me if 

1 come there.” “ No, no,” says he, “ me make they no 
eat you.; me make they much love you." Then he told 
me, as well as he could, how kind they were to the seventeen 
white men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came 
on shore there in distress. 

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my 
design of going over with him to the continent, that I told 
him he should go home. He answered not one word, but 
looked very grave and sad. I asked him what was the 
matter with him i He asked me again thus, “ Why you 
angry mad with Friday i what me done {"'I asked him 
what he meant. I told him I was not angry with him at 



88 ADVENT URES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


all. 41 No angry 1 no angry ! ” says he, repeating the 
words several times. 44 Why send Friday home away to my 
nation i ” 44 Why,” says I, 44 Friday, did you not say 
you wished you were there i ” 44 Yes, yes,” says he, 44 wish 
be both there, no wish Friday there, no master there.” 
In a word, he would not think of going there without me. 
44 I go there, Friday i ” says I ; 44 what shall I do there i ” 
He turned very quick upon me at this : 44 You do great 
deal much good,” says he ; 44 you teach wild mans to be 
good, tame mans ; you tell them know God, pray God. 
You teachee me good, you teachee them good.” 44 No, 
no, Friday,” says 1, 44 you shall go without me ; leave me 
here to live by myself, as I did before.” He looked 
confused again at that word, and running to one of the 
hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, 
comes and gives it me. 44 What must I do with this i ” 
says I to him. 44 You take kill Friday,” said he. 44 What 
must I kill you for i ” said I again. He returns very quick, 
44 What you send Friday away for i Take kill Friday, no 
send Friday away.” This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw 
tears stand in his eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered 
the utmost affection in him to me, and a firm resolution in 
him, that I told him then, and often after, that I would 
never send him away from me if he was willing to stay 
with me. 

I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own 
country was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and 
his hopes of my doing them good. Without any more 
delay I went to work with Friday to find out a great tree 
proper to fell and make a large periagua, or canoe, to under- 
take the voyage. But the main thing was, to get one so 
near the water that we might launch it when it was made. 
At last Friday pitched upon a tree, for I found he knew 
much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it. 
He was for burning the hollow of this tree out, to make it for 
a boat, but I showed him how rather to cut it out with tools ; 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 89 

which he did very handily ; and in about a month's hard 
labour we finished it, and made it very handsome ; especi- 
ally when, with our axes, which I showed him how to handle, 
we cut and hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat. 
After this it cost us near a fortnight’s time to get her 
along, as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers into the 
water ; but when she was in, she would have carried 
twenty men with great ease. When she was in the water, 
and though she was so big, it amazed me to see with what 
dexterity, and how swift my man Friday would manage her, 
turn her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he would, 
and if we might venture over in her. “ Yes,” he said, 
“ he venture over in her very well, though great blow 
wind.” However, I had a farther design that he knew 
nothing of, and that was to make a mast and sail, and to 
fit her with an anchor and cable. 

I was near two months performing this last work, viz., 
rigging and fitting my mast and sails ; for I finished them 
very complete, making a small stay, and a sail, or foresail, 
to it, to assist, if we would turn to windward ; and, which 
was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of her to 
steer with. After all this was done too, I had my man 
Friday to teach as to what belonged to the navigation of 
my boat ; for though he knew very well how to paddle a 
canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a sail and a 
rudder ; and was the most amazed when he saw me work 
the boat to and again in the sea by the rudder, and how the 
sail jibbed, and filled this way, or that way, as the course 
we sailed changed. With a little use I made all these 
things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor, 
except that as to the compass I could make him under- 
stand very little. 

The rainy season was, in the meantime, upon me, when 
I kept more within doors than at other times ; so I had 
stowed our new vessel as secure as we could, bringing her 
up into the creek ; and hauling her up to the shore at high- 



go ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

water mark, I made my man Friday dig a little dock, just 
big enough to hold her, and just deep enough to give her 
water enough to float in ; and then, when the tide was out, 
we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the water 
out ; and so she lay dry, as to the tide, from the sea ; and 
to keep the rain off, we laid a great many boughs of trees, 
so thick, that she was as well thatched as a house ; and thus 
we waited for the month of November and December, in 
which I designed to make my adventure* 

One morning I called to Friday, and bade him go to the 
seashore and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing 
which we generally got once a week, for the sake of the 
eggs as well as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone 
when he came running back, and flew over my outer wall, 
or fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the steps 
he set his feet on ; and before I had time to speak to 
him, he cries out to me, 44 O master I O master 1 O sorrow 1 
O bad 1 " 44 What's the matter, Friday i " says I. 44 O 
yonder, there/' says he, 44 one, two, three canoe l one, two, 
three ! " 44 Well, Friday," says I, 44 do not be frighted." 
So I heartened him up as well as I could. However, I 
saw the poor fellow was most terribly scared ; for nothing 
ran in his head but that they were come to look for him, and 
would cut him in pieces, and eat him. I comforted him as 
well as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as he, 
and that they would eat me as well as him. 44 But," says 
1, 44 Friday, we must resolve to fight them. Can you fight, 
Friday i " 44 Me shoot," says he ; 44 but there come many 
great number." 44 No matter for that," said I again ; 
44 our guns will fright them that we do not kill." So I 
asked him whether, if I resolved to defend him, he would 
defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid him. 
He said, 44 Me die when you bid die, master." So I went and 
fetched a good dram of rum, and gave him. When he 
had drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces, which 
we always carried, and load them with large swan-shot. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 91 

as big as small pistol-bullets* Then I took four muskets, 
and loaded them with two slugs and five small bullets each ; 
and my two pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each* 
I hung my great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and 
gave Friday his hatchet. 

When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective 
glass, and went up to the side of the hill to see what I could 
discover ; and I found quickly that there were one and 
twenty savages, three prisoners, and three canoes, and 
that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant 
banquet upon these three human bodies* I observed 
also that they were landed, not where they had done when 
Friday made his escape, but nearer to my creek, where the 
shore was low, and where a thick wood came dose almost 
down to the sea* This, with the abhorrence of the inhuman 
errand these wretches came about, filled me with such 
indignation, that I came down again to Friday, and told 
him I was resolved to go down to them, and kill them all, 
and asked him if he would stand by me. He was now 
gotten over his fright, and his spirits being a little raised 
with the dram I had given him, he was very cheerful, and 
told me, as before, he would die when I bid die* 

In this fit of fury, I divided the arms which I had 
charged between us. I took a small bottle of rum in my 
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more powder and 
bullet.; and as to orders, I charged him to keep close 
behind me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do anything, till 
I bid him, and in the meantime not to speak a word* In 
this posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of near 
a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get into the wood, 
so that I might come within shot of them before I should 
be discovered* I entered the wood with all possible 
wariness and silence, Friday following close at my heels* 
I marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side 
which was next to them ; only that one corner of the wood 
lay between me and them* Here I called softly to Friday, 



92 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

and showing him a great tree, which was just at the comer 
of the wood, I bade him go to the tree and bring me word 
if he could see there plainly what they were doing. He did 
so, and came immediately back to me, and told me they 
might be plainly viewed there ; that they were all about 
their fire, eating the flesh of one of their prisoners, and that 
another lay bound upon the sand, a little from them, which, 
he said, they would kill next ; and, which fired all the very 
soul within me, he told me it was not one of their nation, 
but one of the bearded men, whom he had told me of, that 
came to their country in the boat. I was filled with horror 
at the very naming the white, bearded man ; and going to 
the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay 
upon the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet 
tied with flags, or things like rushes, and that he was an 
European, and had clothes on. 

There was another tree, and a little thicket beyond it, 
about fifty yards nearer to them than the place where 1 
was, which, by going a little way about, I saw I might come 
at undiscovered, and that then I should be within half shot 
of them ; so going back about twenty paces, I got behind 
some bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other 
tree ; and then I came to a little rising ground, which 
gave me a full view of them, at the distance of about eighty 
yards. I had now not a moment to lose, for nineteen of the 
dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all close huddled 
together, and had just sent the other two to butcher the 
poor Christian, and bring him, perhaps limb by limb, to 
their fire ; and they were stooped down to untie the bands 
at his feet. I turned to Friday : 44 Now, Friday/' said I, 
44 do as I bid thee ; do exactly as you see me do ; fail in 
nothing." So I set down one of the muskets and the 
fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday did the like by 
his ; and with the other musket I took my aim at the 
savages, bidding him do the like. Then asking him if he 
was ready, he said, 44 Yes." 44 Then fire at them," said I ; 
and the same moment I fired also. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 93 

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the 
side that he shot he killed two of them, and wounded three 
more ; and on my side I killed one, and wounded two. 
They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation ; 
and all of them who were not hurt jumped up upon 
their feet, but did not immediately know which way to 
run, or which way to look, for they knew not from whence 
their destruction came. Friday kept his eyes close upon 
me, that, as I had bid him, he might observe what I did ; 
so as soon as the first shot was made I threw down the 
piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the 
like. He sees me cock and present ; he did the same again. 
“ Are you ready, Friday i ” said I. “ Yes,” says he. 
“ Let fly, then,” says I, “ in the name of God 1 ” and with 
that I fired again among the amazed wretches, and so did 
Friday ; and as our pieces were now loaded with what I 
called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets, we found only 
two drop, but so many were wounded, that they ran about 
yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody, and 
miserably wounded most of them ; whereof three more 
fell quickly after, though not quite dead. 

“ Now, Friday,” says I, laying down the discharged 
pieces, and taking up the musket which was yet loaded, 
” follow me,” says I, which he did with a great deal of 
courage j upon which I rushed out of the wood, and 
showed myself and Friday close at my foot. As soon as 
I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and 
bade Friday do so too ; and running as fast as I could, 
I made directly towards the poor victim, who was, as I 
said, lying upon the beach, or shore, between the place 
where they sat and the sea. The two butchers, who were 
just going to work with him, had left him at the surprise of 
our first fire, and fled in a terrible fright, and jumped into 
a canoe, and three more of the rest made the same way. 
I turned to Friday, and bid him step forwards and fire at 
them. He understood me immediately, and running 



94 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

about forty yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and 
I thought he had killed them all, for I saw them all fall of 
a heap into the boat ; though I saw two of them up again 
quickly* He killed two of them, and wounded the third, 
so that he lay down in the bottom of the boat as if he had 
been dead* 

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my 
knife and cut the flags that bound the poor victim ; and 
loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him up, and asked him 
in the Portuguese tongue what he was. He answered in 
Latin, 44 Christianus,” but was so weak and faint, that he 
could scarce stand or speak* I took my bottle out of my 
pocket and gave it him, making signs that he should drink, 
which he did ; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he 
ate. Then I asked him what countryman he was ; and 
he said, 44 Espagniole ; ” and being a little recovered, let 
me know, by all the signs he could possibly make, how 
much he was in my debt for his deliverance. 44 Seignior,” 
said I, with as much Spanish as I could make up , 44 we will 
talk afterwards, but we must fight now* If you have any 
strength left, take this pistol and sword, and lay about you.” 
He took them very thankfully, and no sooner had he the 
arms in his hands but, as if they had put new vigour into 
him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had cut 
two of them in pieces in an instant ; for the truth is, as 
the whole was a surprise to them, so the poor creatures 
were so much frighted with the noise of our pieces, that 
they fell down for mere amazement and fear, and had no 
more power to attempt their own escape, than their flesh 
had to resist our shot ; and that was the case of those five 
that Friday shot at in the boat ; for as three of them fell 
with the hurt they received, so the other two fell with the 
fright* I kept my piece in my hand still without firing, 
being willing to keep my charge ready, because I had given 
the Spaniard my pistol and sword* So I called to Friday, 
and bade him run up to the tree from whence we first fired. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 95 

and fetch the arms which lay there that had been dis- 
charged; and then giving him my musket, I sat down 
myself to load all the rest again, and bade them come to 
me when they wanted* While I was loading these pieces, 
there happened a fierce engagement between the Spaniard 
and one of the savages, who made at him with one of their 
great wooden swords, the same weapon that was to have 
killed him before if I had not prevented it* The Spaniard, 
who was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, though 
weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had cut 
him two great wounds on his head ; but the savage being 
a stout, lusty fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him 
down, being faint, and was wringing my sword out of his 
hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quit- 
ting the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, shot the 
savage through the body, and killed him upon the spot, 
before I, who was running to help him, could come near 
him* 

Friday being now left to his liberty, pursued the flying 
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet ; 
and with that he despatched those three who, as I said 
before, were wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest 
he could come up with ; and the Spaniard coming to me 
for a gun, I gave him one of the fowling-pieces, with which 
he pursued two of the savages, and wounded them both ; 
but as he was not able to run, they both got from him into 
the wood, where Friday pursued them, and killed one of 
them ; but the other was too nimble for him, and though 
he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the sea 
and swam with all his might off to those two who were left 
in the canoe ; which three in the canoe, with one wounded, 
who we know not whether he died or no, were all that 
escaped our hands of one and twenty* The account of 
the rest is as follows : 3 killed at our first shot from the 
tree ; 2 killed at the next shot ; 2 killed by Friday in the 
boat ; 2 killed by ditto, of those at first wounded ; 1 killed 



96 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

by ditto in the wood ; 3 killed by the Spaniard ; 4 killed, 
being found dropped here and there of their wounds, or 
killed by Friday in his chase of them ; 4 escaped in the 
boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead ; 21 in all. 

Those that were in the canoe worked hard to get out of 
gun-shot ; and though Friday made two or three shots at 
them, I did not find that he hit any of them. Friday would 
fain have had me take one of their canoes, and pursued 
them ; and, indeed, I was very anxious about their escape, 
lest .carrying the news home to their people they should 
come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their 
canoes, and devour us by mere multitude. So I consented 
to pursue them by sea, and running to one of their canoes 
I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me. But when I was 
in the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature 
lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, 
for the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing 
what the matter was ; for he had not been able to look 
up over the side of the boat, he was tied so hard, neck 
and heels, and had been tied so long, that he had really 
but little life in him. 

I immediately cut the twisted Hags or rushes, which they 
had bound him with, and would have helped him up ; but 
he could not stand or speak, but groaned most piteously, 
believing, it seems, still that he was only unbound in order 
to be killed. When Friday came to him, I bade him speak 
to him, and tell him of his deliverance ; and pulling out my 
bottle made him give the poor wretch a dram. But when 
Friday came to hear him speak, and look in his face, it 
would have moved any one to tears to have seen how 
Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, 
laughed, hallooed, . jumped about, danced, sung; then 
cried again, wrung his hands, beat his own face and head, 
and then sung and jumped about again, like a distracted 
creature. It was a good while before I could make him 
speak to me, or tell me what was the matter ; but when he 





ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 97 

came a little to himself, he told me that it was his 
father* 

It is not easy for me to express how it moved me to see 
what ecstasy and filial affection had worked in this poor 
savage at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered 
from death* He went in and out of the boat a great many 
times* When he went in to him, he would sit down, open 
his breast, and hold his father's head close to his bosom, 
half-an-hour together, to nourish it ; then he took his arms 
and ankles, which were numbed and stiff with the binding, 
and chafed and rubbed them with his hands ; and I, 
perceiving what the case was, gave him some rum out of 
my bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal of 
good* This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe 
with the other savages, who were now gotten almost out 
of sight ; and it was happy for us that we did not, for it 
blew so hard within two hours after, and before they could 
be gotten a quarter of their way, and continued blowing 
so hard all night, and that from the north-west, which was 
against them, that I could not suppose their boat could 
live, or that they ever reached to their own coast* 

But to return to Friday. He was so busy about his 
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him off for 
some time ; but after I thought he could leave him a little, 
I called him to me, and he came jumping and laughing, 
and pleased to the highest extreme. Then I asked him if 
he had given his father any bread* He shook his head, 
and said, 44 None ; ugly dog eat all up self*" So I gave 
him a cake of bread out of a pouch I carried on purpose* 
I also gave him a dram for himself, but he would not taste 
it, but carried it to his father* I had in my pocket also 
two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a handful 
of them for his father* He had no sooner given his father 
these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat and run 
away, as if he had been bewitched, he ran at such a rate ; 
for he was the swiftest fellow of his foot that ever I saw* 

G 



98 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 



THIS WATER REVIVED HIS FATHER 


He was out of sight, as it were, in an instant ; and though 
I called, and hallooed too, after him, it was all one, away he 
went ; and in a quarter of an hour I saw him come back 
again, though not so fast as he went ; and as he came 
nearer I found he had something in his hand* He had been 
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father 
some fresh water, and had got two more cakes or loaves of 
bread* The bread he gave me, but the water he carried 
to his father* I was very thirsty too and took a little sup 
of it. This water revived his father more than all the rum 
or spirits I had given him, for he was just fainting with 
thirst* When his father had drank, I called to him to know 
if there was any water left. He said 44 Yes ; ” and I bade 
him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much want 
of it as his father ; and I sent one of the cakes, that Friday 
brought, to the Spaniard too, who was reposing bimseif 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 99 

upon a green place under the shade of a tree ; and whose 
limbs were also very stiff, and very much swelled with the 
rude bandage he had been tied with* When I saw that 
upon Friday's coming to him with the water he sat up and 
drank, and took the bread, and began to eat, I went to him, 
and gave him a handful of raisins* He looked up in 
my face with all the tokens of gratitude and thankfulness 
that could appear in any countenance ; but was so weak, 
notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight, 
that he could not stand up upon his feet* His ankles were 
swelled and painful to him ; so I bade him sit still, and 
caused Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum* 
I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up, 
if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he should 
carry him to our dwelling, where I would take care of him* 
But Friday, a lusty strong fellow, took the Spaniard quite 
up upon his back, and carried him away to the boat, lifted 
him in, and set him close to his father ; launched the boat 
off, and paddled it along the shore faster than I could walk* 
So he brought them both safe into our creek, and leaving 
them in the boat, runs away to fetch the other canoe. As 
he passed me, I spoke to him, and asked him whither he 
went* He told me, 44 Go fetch more boat." So away he 
went like the wind, for sure never man or horse ran like 
him ; and he had the other canoe in the creek almost as 
soon as I got to it by land ; so he wafted me over, and 
then went to help our new guests out of the boat ; but 
they were neither of them able to walk, so that poor 
Friday knew not what to do. 

To remedy this I made a kind of hand-barrow to lay 
them on, and Friday and I carried them up both together 
upon it between us. But when we got them to the out- 
side of our wall, or fortification, it was impossible to get 
them over* So Friday and I, in about two hours' time, made 
a very handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above 
that with boughs of trees, being in the space without our 



100 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

f 

outward fence, and between that and the grove of young 
wood which I had planted ; and here we made them two 
beds of such things as I had, viz*, of good rice-straw, with 
blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another to cover them, 
on each bed* 

My island was now peopled, and I thought myself very 
rich in subjects ; and it was a merry reflection, which 
I frequently made, how like a king I looked* I set Friday 
to work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good 
dish of flesh and broth, and as I cooked it without doors, 
for I made no fire within my inner wall, so I sat down and 
ate my own dinner also with them, and as well as I could 
cheered them, and encouraged them ; Friday being my 
interpreter, especially to his father, and, indeed, to the 
Spaniard too; for the Spaniard spoke the language of 
the savages pretty well* 

The next day I ordered Friday to go and bury the dead 
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun ; and also 
the horrid remains of their barbarous feast* 

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my 
two new subjects ; and first, I set Friday to inquire of his 
father what he thought of the escape of the savages in that 
canoe* His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat 
never could live out the storm which blew that night they 
went off, but must, of necessity be drowned, or driven 
south to those other shores, where they were as sure to be 
devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast 
away* But as to what they would do if they came safe on 
shore, he said he knew not ; but it was his opinion that 
they were so dreadfully frighted with the manner of their 
being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he believed they 
would tell their people they were all killed by thunder and 
lightning, not by the hand of man ; and that the two 
which appeared, viz*, Friday and me, were two heavenly 
spirits, or furies, come down to destroy them, and not 
men with weapons* This, he said, he knew, because he 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE iox 


heard them all cry out so in their language to one another ; 
for it was impossible to them to conceive that a man could 
dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at a distance without 
lifting up the hand, as was done now* And this old savage 
was in the right ; for, as I understood since by other hands, 
the savages never attempted to go over to the island after- 
wards* They were so terrified with the accounts given by 
those four men (for, it seems, they did escape the sea), 
that they believed whoever went to that enchanted island 
would be destroyed with fire from the gods* 

In a little time, no more canoes appearing, the fear of 
their coming wore off, and I began to take my former 
thoughts of a voyage to the main into consideration ; 
being likewise assured, by Friday's father, that I might 
depend upon good usage from their nation, on his account, 
if I would go* But my thoughts were a little suspended 
when I had a serious discourse with the Spaniard, and when 
I understood that there were sixteen more of his country- 
men and Portuguese who, having been cast away, and 
made their escape to that side, lived there at peace with 
the savages, but were very sore put to it for necessaries, 
and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars of 
their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship bound 
from the Rio de la Plata to the Havana ; that they had 
five Portuguese seamen on board, whom they took out of 
another wreck ; that five of their own men were drowned 
when the first ship was lost, and that these escaped and 
arrived, almost starved, on the cannibal coast, where they 
expected to have been devoured every moment* I asked 
him what he thought would become of them there, and if 
they had formed no design of making any escape i He said 
they had many consultations about it ; but that having 
neither vessel, or tools to build one, or provisions of any 
kind, their councils always ended in tears and despair. 
I asked him how he thought they would receive a pro- 
posal from me, which might tend towards an escape ; and 



102 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


whether, if they were all here, it might not be done i I 
told him with freedom, I feared mosdy their treachery 
and ill usage of me if I put my life in their hands* 

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuity, 
that their condition was so miserable, and they were so 
sensible of it, that he believed they would abhor the thought 
of using any man unkindly that should contribute to their 
deliverance ; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them 
with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and 
bring me their answer ; that he would make conditions 
with them upon their solemn oath that they should be 
absolutely under my leading, as their commander and 
captain ; and that they should swear to be true to me, and 
to go to such Christian country as that I should agree to, 
and no other, and to be directed wholly and absolutely 
by my orders ; and that he would bring a contract from 
them, under their hands, for that purpose* Then he told 
me he would first swear to me himself, that he would never 
stir from me as long as he lived till I gave him orders ; 
and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood, 
if there should happen the least breach of faith among his 
countrymen* Upon these assurances, I resolved to send 
the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to treat* 
But when we had gotten all things in a readiness to go, the 
Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much 
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the 
other hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it, 
and by his advice put off the deliverance of his comrades 
for at least half a year* The case was thus* 

He had been with us now about a month, during which 
time I had let him see in what manner I had provided 
for my support ; and he saw evidently what stock of corn 
and rice I had made up ; which was not sufficient, at least 
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was 
increased to number four; but much less would it be 
sufficient if his countrymen should come over ; and least 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 103 

of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel, if we 
should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian 
colonies of America* So he told me he thought it would 
be more advisable to let him and the two others cultivate 
some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow ; 
and that we should wait another harvest, that we might 
have a supply of com for his countrymen when they should 
come* I could not but be very well pleased with his 
proposal, as well as I was satisfied with his fidelity* So we 
fell to digging all four of us, and in about a month's time 
we sowed twenty-two bushels of barley and sixteen jars 
of rice ; which was, in short, all the seed we had to 
spare. 

Having now society enough, and our number being 
sufficient to put us out of fear of the savages, if they had 
come, unless their number had been very great, we went 
freely all over the island ; and I marked out several 
trees which I thought fit for out work, and I set Friday and 
his father to cutting them down ; and then I caused the 
Spaniard to oversee and direct their work* I showed 
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large 
tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like, 
till they had made about a dozen large planks of good oak, 
near two feet broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two 
inches to four inches thick. 

At the same time, I contrived to increase my little flock 
of tame goats as much as I could ; and to this purpose 
I made Friday and the Spaniard go out one day, and 
myself with Friday the next day, and by this means we got 
above twenty young kids to breed up with the rest ; for 
whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added 
them to our flock. But above all, I caused a prodigious 
quantity of grapes to be hung up in the sun. It was now 
harvest, and our crop in good order. From our twenty- 
two bushels of barley we brought in and thrashed out 
above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in 



104 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

proportion of the rice ; which was store enough for our 
food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards 
had been on shore with me ; or if we had been ready for a 
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship 
to have carried as to any part of America* When we had 
thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to 
work to make more wicker-work, viz*, great baskets, in 
which we kept it ; and the Spaniard was very handy and 
dexterous at this part* And now having a full supply of 
food for all the guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard 
leave to go over to the main. 

The Spaniard and the old savage went away in one of the 
canoes which they might be said to come in, or rather were 
brought in, when they came as prisoners to be devoured 
by the savages* I gave each of them a musket, with a fire- 
lock on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, 
charging them to be very good husbands of both, and not 
to use either of them but ujpon urgent occasion* I gave 
them provisions sufficient for themselves for many days, 
and sufficient for all their countrymen for about eight days* 
time ; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, 
agreeing with them about a signal they should hang out 
at their return, by which I should know them again, 
when they came back, at a distance before they came on 
shore* 

It was no less than eight days I had waited for .them, 
when a strange and unforeseen accident intervened* I was 
fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my man 
Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, “ Master, 
master, they are come, they are come 1 ” I jumped up, 
and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as I could get 
my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by the way, 
was by this time grown to be a very thick wood ; I say, 
regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which was 
not my custom to do ; but I was surprised when, turning 
my eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 105 



DISCOVERED A SHIP 


and half's distance standing in for the shore, with a shoulder- 
of-mutton sail, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring 
them in ; also I observed presently that they did not 
come from that side which the shore lay on, but from the 
southernmost end of the island* Upon this I called Friday 
in, and bid him lie close, for these were not the people we 
looked for, and that we might not know yet whether they 
were friends or enemies* In the next place, I went in 
to fetch my perspective glass, to see what I could make 
of them ; and climbed up to the top of the hill* I had 
scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye discovered a 
ship lying at anchor at about two leagues and an half's 
distance from me, south-south-east, but not above a 
league and an half from the shore* By my observation, it 
appeared plainly to be an English ship, and the boat 
appeared to be an English longboat* The joy of seeing a 
ship, and one who I had reason to believe was manned by 



io6 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such 
as I cannot describe. But yet I had some secret doubts 
hung about me, bidding me keep upon my guard. In 
the first place, it occurred to me to consider what business 
an English ship could have in that part of the world, since 
I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there as 
in distress; and that if they were English really, it was 
most probable that they were here upon no good design ; 
and that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the 
hands of thieves and murderers. 

I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the 
boat draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to 
thrust in at. However, as they did not come quite far 
enough, they did not see the little inlet where I formerly 
landed my rafts ; but run their boat on shore upon the 
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very happy 
for me ; for otherwise they would have landed just at 
my door, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, 
and perhaps have plundered me of all I had. When they 
were on shore, I was fully satisfied that they were English- 
men, at least most of them. There were in all eleven men, 
whereof three of them I found were unarmed and, as I 
thought, bound ; and when the first four or five of them 
were jumped on shore, they took those three out of the boat, 
as prisoners. One of the three I could perceive using 
the most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and 
despair, even to a kind of extravagance. 

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really 
was, but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, 
expecting every moment when the three prisoners should 
be killed ; nay, once I saw one of the villains lift up his arm 
with a great cutlass to strike one of the poor men ; and 
I expected to see him fall every moment, at which all the 
blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins. I 
wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that 
was gone with him ; or that I had any way to have come 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 107 

undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have 
rescued the three men. After I had observed the outrageous 
usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed 
the fellows run scattering about the land, as if they wanted 
to see the country. I observed that the three other men 
had liberty to go also where they pleased ; but they sat 
down all three upon the ground, very pensive, and looked 
like men in despair. 

It was just at the top of high-water when these people 
came on shore ; and while partly they stood parleying 
with the prisoners they brought, and partly while they 
rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they 
had carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water 
was ebbed considerably away, leaving their boat aground. 
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found after- 
wards, having drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep. 
However, one of them waking sooner than the other, and 
finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hal- 
looed for the rest, who were straggling about, upon which 
they all soon came to the boat ; but it was past all their 
strength to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and 
the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like 
a quicksand. In this condition, they gave it over, and 
away they strolled about the country again ; and I heard 
one of them say aloud to another, calling them off from the 
boat, •" Why, let her alone, Jack, can't ye i she will float 
next tide ; " by which I was fully confirmed in the main 
inquiry of what countrymen they were. All this while I 
kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my 
castle, any farther than to my place of observation near the 
top of the hill ; and very glad I was to think how well it 
was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before 
the boat could be on float again, and by that time it would 
be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions, 
and to hear their discourse. 

In the meantime, I fitted myself up for a battle, as before, 



xo8 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


though with more caution, knowing I had to do with 
another kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered 
Friday also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with 
his gun, to load himself with arms. I took myself two 
fowling-pieces, and I gave him three muskets. My figure, 
indeed, was very fierce. I had my formidable goat's-skin 
coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword 
by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each 
shoulder. It was my design not to have made any 
attempt till it was dark ; but about two o'clock, being the 
heat of the day, I found that they were all gone straggling 
into the woods, and, as I thought, were laid down to sleep. 
The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their con- 
dition to get any sleep, were, however, set down under the 
shelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, 
and, as I thought, out of sight of any of the rest. Upon 
this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn some- 
thing of their condition. Immediately I marched in the 
figure as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind 
me, as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite 
so staring a spectre-like figure as I did. I came as near 
them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any of 
them saw me, I called to them in Spanish, “ What are ye, 
gentlemen i " They started up at the noise, but were 
ten times more confounded when they saw me, and the 
uncouth figure that I made. They made no answer at 
all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly from 
me, when I spoke to them in English. 44 Gentlemen," 
said I, 44 do not be surprised at me ; perhaps you may 
have a friend near you, when you did not expect it." 44 He 
must be sent directly from heaven then," said one of them 
very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time 
to me, 44 for our condition is past the help of man." 44 All 
help is from heaven, sir," said I. 44 But can you put a 
stranger in the way how to help you, for you seem to me to 
be in some great distress i I saw you when you landed ; 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 109 

and when you seemed to make applications to the brutes 
that came with you, I saw one of them lift up his sword 
to kill you*” The poor man, with tears running down his 
face, and trembling, looking like one astonished, returned, 
44 Am I talking to God, or man i Is it a real man, or an 
angel i ” 44 Be in no fear about that, sir,” said I. 44 If 
God had sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come 
better clothed, and armed after another manner than you 
see me in* Pray lay aside your fears ; lama man, an 
Englishman, and disposed to assist you, you see* I have 
one servant only ; we have arms and ammunition ; tell 
us freely, can we serve you i What is your case i ” 
44 Our case,” said he, 44 sir, is too long to tell you while our 
murderers are so near ; but in short, sir, I was commander 
of that ship ; my men have mutinied against me, they 
have been hardly prevailed on not to murder me ; and at 
last have set me on shore with these two men with me, one 
my mate, the other a passenger, where we expected to 
perish, believing the place to be uninhabited, and know 
not yet what to think of it.” 44 Where are those brutes, 
your enemies i ” said I. 44 Do you know where they are 
gone i ” 44 There they lie, sir,” said he, pointing to a 

thicket of trees* 44 My heart trembles for fear they have 
seen us, and heard you speak. If they have, they will 
certainly murder us all.” 44 Have they any firearms i ” 
said 1% He answered they had only two pieces, and one 
which they left in the boat* 44 Well then,” said 1, 44 leave 
the rest to me, I see they are all asleep ; it is an easy thing 
to kill them all ; but shall we rather take them prisoners i ” 
He told me there were two desperate villains among them 
that it was scarce safe to show ahy mercy to ; but if they 
were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their 
duty. I asked him which they were* He told me he 
could not at that distance describe them, but he would 
obey my orders in anything I would direct* 44 Well,” 
says I, 44 let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest 



no ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 


they awake, and we will resolve further.” So they 
willingly went back with me, till the woods covered us 
from them. 

" Look you, sir,” said I, " if I venture upon your deliver- 
ance, are you willing to make two conditions with me i ” 
He anticipated my proposals, by telling me that both he 
and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly directed and 
commanded by me in everything ; and if the ship was not 
recovered, he would live and die with me in what part 
of the world soever I would send him ; and the two other 
men said the same. " Well,” says I, “ my conditions are 
but two. z. That while you stay on this island with me, 
you will not pretend to any authority here ; and if I put 
arms into your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give 
them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine upon 
this island ; and in the meantime, be governed by my 
orders, a. That if the ship is, or may be, recovered, you 
will carry me and my man to England, passage free.” 
He gave me all the assurances that the invention and faith 
of man could devise that he would comply with these most 
reasonable demands ; and, besides, would owe his life to 
me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions, as long as he 
lived. “ Well then,” said I, “ here are three muskets for 
you, with powder and ball ; tell me next what you think 
is proper to be done.” He showed all the testimony of his 
gratitude that he was able, but offered to be wholly guided 
by me. I told him the best method I could think of was 
to fire upon them at once, as they lay ; and if any was not 
killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we might 
save them, and so put it wholly upon God's providence to 
direct the shot. He said very modestly that he was loth 
to kill them, if he could help it ; but that those two were 
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the 
mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we should be 
undone still ; for they would go on board and bring the 
whole ship's company, and destroy us all. “ Well then,” 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE xxx 

says I, 44 necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only 
way to save our lives,” However, seeing him still cautious 
of shedding blood, I told him they should go themselves, 
and manage as they found convenient, 

Ixl the middle of this discourse we heard some of them 
awake, and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. 
I asked him if either of them were of the men who he had 
said were the heads of the mutiny. He said 44 No.” 
44 Well then,” said I, 44 you may let them escape ; and 
Providence seems to have wakened them on purpose to 
save themselves. Now, ” says 1, 44 if the rest escape you, 
it is your fault.” 

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given 
him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two com- 
rades with him, with each man a piece in his hand. The 
two men who were with him going first made some noise, 
at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about, 
and seeing them coming cried out to the rest ; but it was 
too late then, for the moment he cried out they fired, the 
captain wisely reserving his own piece. They had so well 
aimed their shot at the men they knew, that one of them 
was killed on the spot, and the other very much wounded ; 
but not being dead, he started up upon his feet, and called 
eagerly for help to the other. But the captain stepping 
to him, told him 'twas too late to cry for help, he should 
call upon God to forgive his villainy ; and with that word 
knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so that he 
never spoke more. There were three more in the com- 
pany, and one of them was also slightly wounded. By this 
time I was come ; and when they saw their danger, and 
that it was in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The 
captain told them he would spare their lives if they would 
give him any assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery 
they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to 
him in recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying 
her back to Jamaica, from whence they came. They gave 



na ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

him all the protestations of their sincerity that could be 
desired, and he was willing to believe them, and spare their 
lives, which I was not against, only I obliged him to keep 
them bound hand and foot while they were upon the island. 

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's 
mate to the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring 
away the oars and sail ; and by and by three straggling men, 
that were parted from the rest, came back upon hearing 
the guns fired ; and seeing their captain, who before was 
their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be 
bound also, and so our victory was complete. 

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire 
into one another’s circumstances. I began first, and told 
him my whole history, which he heard with amazement. 
Above all, the captain admired my fortification, and how 
perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees. 
I told him this was my castle and my residence, but that 
I had a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither 
I could retreat upon occasion, and I would show him that 
too another time. He told me he was perfectly at a loss 
what measures to take, for that there were still six and 
twenty hands on board, who having entered into a cursed 
conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to the 
law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and 
would carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they 
should be brought to the gallows as soon as they came to 
England, or to any of the English colonies ; and that there- 
fore there would be no attacking them with so small a 
number as we were. I mused upon what he said, and 
found it was a very rational conclusion, and that there- 
fore something was to be resolved on very speedily, as well 
to draw the men on board into some snare for their surprise, 
as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us. 
Upon this it presently occurred to me that in a little while 
the ship's crew, wondering what was become of their 
comrades, and of the boat, would certainly come on shore 





I showed them the new captain hanging at the y archarm, 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 113 

in their other boat to seek for them ; and that then, per- 
haps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us* 
Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do was to 
stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, so that they 
might not carry her off ; and taking everything out of her, 
leave her so far useless as not to be fit to swim* Accordingly 
we took the arms which were left on board out of her, and 
whatever else we found there* We knocked a great hole 
in her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to 
master us, yet they could not carry off the boat* 

While we had by main strength heaved the boat up upon 
the beach so high that the tide would not fleet her off at 
high-water mark, and were sat down musing what we should 
do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and saw her make a waft 
with her ancient as a signal for the boat to come on board* 
But no boat stirred ; and they fired several times, making 
other signals for the boat* At last we saw them, by the 
help of my glasses, hoist another boat out, and row towards 
the shore ; and we found, as they approached, that there 
was no less than ten men in her, and that they had firearms 
with them* The captain knew the persons and characters 
of all the men in the boat, of whom he said that there were 
three very honest fellows, who, he was sure, were led into 
this conspiracy by the rest ; but that as for the boatswain, 
and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of the ship's 
crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new enter- 
prise ; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would 
be too powerful for us* I smiled at him, and told him that 
men in our circumstances were past the operation of fear. 

We had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming 
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and 
had, indeed, secured them effectually* Two of them, of 
whom the captain was less assured than ordinary, I sent 
with Friday and one of the three delivered men to my cave, 
where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being 
heard or discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods 

H

if they could have delivered themselves. Here they left 
them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised 
them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their 
liberty in a day or two ; but that if they attempted their 
escape, they should be put to death without mercy. They 
promised faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, 
and were very thankful that they had such good usage as 
to have provisions and a light left them ; for Friday gave 
them candles for their comfort ; and they did not know 
but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance. The 
other prisoners had better usage. Two of them were kept 
pinioned, indeed, because the captain was not free to trust 
them ; but the other two were taken into my service, upon 
their captain’s recommendation, and upon their solemnly 
engaging to live and die with us ; so with them and the 
three honest men we were seven men well armed ; and I 
made no doubt we should be able to deal well enough with 
the ten that were a-coming, considering that the captain 
had said there were three or four honest men among 
them also. 

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat 
lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on 
shore, hauling the boat up after them, which I was glad to 
see ; for I was afraid they would rather have left the boat 
at an anchor some distance from the shore, with some hands 
in her to guard her, and so we should not be able to seize 
the boat. Being on shore, the first thing they did they ran 
all to their other boat ; and it was easy to see that they 
were under a great surprise to find her stripped, as above, 
of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bottom. 
After they had mused a while upon this, they set up two 
or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try 
if they could make their companions hear ; but all was to 
no purpose. Then they came all close in a ring, and fired 
a volley of their small arms, which, indeed, we heard, 
and the echoes made the woods ring. But it was all one ; 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 115 

those in the cave we were sure could not hear, and those in 
our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet 
durst give no answer to them. They were so astonished 
at the surprise of this, that, as they told us afterwards, they 
resolved to go all on board again, to their ship, and let 
them know there that the men were all murdered, and the 
longboat staved. Accordingly, they immediately launched 
their boat again, and gat all of them on board. 

They had not been long put off with the boat but we 
perceived them all coming on shore again ; but with this 
new measure in their conduct, which it seems they consulted 
together upon, viz., to leave three men in the boat, and the 
rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look 
for their fellows. This was a great disappointment to us, 
for now we were at a loss what to do ; for our seizing those 
seven men on shore would be no advantage to us if we let 
the boat escape, because they would then row away to the 
ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and 
set sail, and so our recovering the ship would be lost. 
We had no remedy but to wait and see what the issue of 
things might present. The seven men came on shore, and 
the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good 
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for 
them ; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in 
the boat. Those that came on shore kept close together, 
marching towards the top of the little hill under which my 
habitation lay ; and we could see them plainly, though 
they could not perceive us. We could have been very 
glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might 
have fired at them, or that they would have gone farther 
off, that we might have come abroad. But when they were 
come to the brow of the hill, where they could see a great 
way into the valleys and woods which lay towards the north- 
east part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted 
and hallooed till they were weary ; and not caring, it seems, 
to venture far from the shore, nor far from one another. 



1x6 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

they sat down together under a tree, to consider of it. 
Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the 
other party of them had done, they had done the job for 
us ; but they were too full of apprehensions of danger. 

We lay still a long time, very irresolute what course to 
take. At length I told them there would be nothing to be 
done, in my opinion, till night ; and then, if they did not 
return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way to get 
between them and the shore, and so might use some strata- 
gem with them in the boat to get them on shore. We 
waited a great while, though very impatient for their 
removing ; and were very uneasy when, after long consulta- 
tions, we saw them start all up, and march down toward the 
sea. It seems they had such dreadful apprehensions upon 
them of the danger of the place, that they resolved to 
give their companions over for lost, and so go on with 
their intended voyage. But I presently thought of a strata- 
gem to fetch them back again. I ordered Friday and the 
captain's mate to go over the little creek westward, and as 
soon as they came to a little rising ground, at about half 
a mile distance, I bade them halloo as loud as they could, 
and wait till they found the seamen heard them ; that as 
soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them, they 
should return it again ; and then keeping out of sight, take 
a round, always answering when the other hallooed, to 
draw them as far into the island, and among the woods, as 
possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways 
as I directed them. 

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the 
mate hallooed ; and they presently answering, ran along 
the shore westward, when they were stopped by the creek, 
where they could not get over, and called for the boat to 
come up and set them over, as, indeed, I expected. When 
they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat being 
gone up a good way into the creek, and, as it were, in a 
harbour within the land, they took one of the three men 



s 


;W:i 



I- AT T im OUT TO HIM IN THE BOAT TO YIELD 

out of her to go along with them, and left only two in the 
boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the 
shore. That was what I wished for; and immediately 
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their business, I 
took the rest with me, and crossing the creek out of their 
sight, we surprised the two men before they were aware ; 
one of them lying on shore, and the other being in the boat. 
The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, 
and going to start up. The captain, who was foremost, 
ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and then called 
out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man. 
There needed very few arguments to persuade a single 
man to yield when he saw five men upon him, and his 

comrade knocked down. . 

In the meantime, Friday and the captain s mate so well 
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, 




n8 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and 
from one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired 
them, but left them where they were very sure they could 
not reach back to the boat before it was dark ; and indeed 
they were heartily tired themselves also by die time they 
came back to us. It was several hours after Friday came 
back to me before they came back to their boat ; and we 
could hear the foremost of them, long before they came 
quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could 
also hear them complain how lame and tired they were. 

'Tis impossible to express their confusion when they 
found the boat fast aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, 
and their two men gone. We could hear them call to one 
another in a most lamentable manner, telling one another 
they were gotten into an enchanted island ; that either there 
were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or 
else there were devils and spirits in it, and they should 
all be carried away. They hallooed again, and called their 
two comrades by their names a great many times ; but no 
answer. After some time we could see them, by the little 
light there was, run about, wringing their hands like men 
in despair. My men would fain have me give them leave 
to fall upon them at once in the dark ; but I was willing 
to take them at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill 
as few of them as I could ; and especially I was unwilling 
to hazard the killing any of our own men. I resolved 
to wait, to see if they did not separate ; and, therefore, 
to make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer, and 
ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands 
and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they 
might not be discovered, and get as near them as they could 
possibly before they offered to fire. They had not been 
long in that posture but that the boatswain, who was the 
principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown 
himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, 
came walking towards them, with two more of their crew. 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 119 

The captain was so eager, as having this principal rogue so 
much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to 
let him come so near as to be sure of him, for they only 
heard his tongue before ; but when they came nearer, the 
captain and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at them. 
The boatswain was killed upon the spot ; the next man 
was shot into the body, and fell just by him, though he did 
not die till an hour or two after ; and the third ran for it. 

At the noise of the fire I immediately advanced with my 
whole army, which was now eight men, viz., myself, general- 
issimo ; Friday, my lieutenant-general ; the captain and 
his two men, and the three prisoners of war, whom we 
had trusted with arms. We came upon them in the dark, 
so that they could not see our number ; and I made the 
man we had left in the boat, who was now one of us, call 
to them by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley, 
and so might perhaps reduce them to terms. So he calls 
out as loud as he could to one of them, “ Tom Smith ! Tom 
Smith 1 ” Tom Smith answered immediately, “ Who's 
that i Robinson i " For it seems he knew his voice. The 
other answered, " Ay, ay ; for God's sake, Tom Smith, 
throw down your arms and yield, or you are all dead men 
this moment." “Who must we yield to S' Where are 
they i " says Smith again. “ Here they are," says he ; 
“ here's our captain, and fifty men with him, have been 
hunting you this two hours; the boatswain is killed. 
Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner ; and if you do 
not yield, you are all lost." “ Will they give us quarter 
then,'' says Tom Smith, “ and we will yield s' '' “ I'll go 
and ask, if you promise to yield,” says Robinson. So 
he asked the captain, and the captain then calls himself 
out, “ You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down 
your arms immediately, and submit, you shall have your 
lives, all but Will Atkins." Upon this Will Atkins cried 
out, “ For God's sake, captain, give me quarter ; what have 
I done i They have been all as bad as I " ; which, by the 



120 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

way, was not true neither ; for, it seems, this Will Atkins 
was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they 
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, 
and giving him injurious language* However, the captain 
told him he must lay down his arms at discretion, and 
trust to the governor's mercy ; by which he meant me, for 
they all called me governor* In a word, they all laid down 
their arms, and begged their lives ; and I sent the man that 
had parleyed with them and two more, who bound them 
all ; and then my great army of fifty men, which, par- 
ticularly with those three, were all but eight, came up 
and seized upon them all, and upon their boat ; only that 
I kept myself and one more out of sight for reasons of state* 
Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing 
the ship ; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to 
parley with them, he expostulated with them upon the vil- 
lainy of their practices with him, and at length upon the 
farther wickedness of their design, and how certainly it 
must bring them to misery and distress in the end, and 
perhaps to the gallows* They all appeared very penitent, 
and begged hard for their lives* As for that, he told them 
they were none of his prisoners, but the commander of the 
island ; that they thought they had set him on shore in a 
barren, uninhabited island ; but it had pleased God so 
to direct them that the island was inhabited, and that the 
governor was an Englishman ; that he might hang them all 
there, if he pleased ; but as he had given them all quarter, 
he supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt 
with there as justice required, except Atkins, whom he was 
commanded by the governor to advise to prepare for death, 
for that he would be hanged in the morning* Though this 
was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect* 
Atkins fell upon his knees, to beg the captain to intercede 
with the governor for his life ; and all the rest begged of 
him, for God's sake, that they might not be sent to England. 

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 121 

was come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring 
these fellows in to be hearty in getting possession of the 
ship ; so I retired in the dark from them, that they might 
not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the 
captain to me* When I called, as at a good distance, 
one of the men was ordered to speak again, and say to the 
captain, 44 Captain, the commander calls for you/' And 
presently the captain replied, 44 Tell his excellency I am 
just a-coming/' This more perfectly amused them, and 
they all believed that the commander was just by with his 
fifty men* Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him 
my project for seizing the ship, which he liked wonderfully 
well, and resolved to put in execution the next morning* 
But in order to execute it with more art and success, I told 
him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go 
and take Atkins and two more of the worst of them, and 
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay* This 
was committed to Friday and the two men who came on 
shore with the captain. They conveyed them to the cave, 
as to a prison* It was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to 
men in their condition* The others I ordered to my bower ; 
and as it was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was 
secure enough, considering they were on their behaviour* 

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to 
enter into a parley with them ; to try them, and tell me 
whether he thought they might be trusted or no to go on 
board and surprise the ship* He talked to them of the 
injury done him, of the condition they were brought to ; 
and that though the governor had given them quarter for 
their lives as to the present action, yet if they were sent 
to England they would all be hanged in chains ; but that 
if they would join in so just an attempt as to recover the ship, 
he would have the governor's engagement for their pardon. 

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be 
accepted by men in their condition* They fell down on 
their knees to the captain, and promised, with the deepest 



122 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSO 


imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the last 
drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and 
would go with him all over the world ; that they would 
own him for a father to themas long as they lived* 41 Well,” 
says the captain, 44 I must go and tell the governor what you 
say, and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it*” 
So he brought me an account of the temper he found them 
in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful* 
Nevertheless, that we might be very secure, I told him 
he should go back again and choose out five of them, and 
tell them they might see that he did not want men, that 
he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that 
the governor would keep the other two and the three that 
were sent prisoners to the castle, my cave, as hostages for 
the fidelity of those five ; and that if they proved unfaithful 
in the execution, the five hostages should be hanged in 
chains alive upon the shore* This looked severe, and 
convinced them that the governor was in earnest* How- 
ever, they had no way left them but to accept it ; and it 
was now the business of the prisoners, as much as of the 
captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty* 

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition* 
i* The captain, his mate, and passenger* 2* Then the two 
prisoners of the first gang, to whom, having their characters 
from the captain, I had given their liberty, and trusted 
them with arms* 3. The other two whom I had kept till 
now in my bower, pinioned, but upon the captain's motion 
had now released* 4. These five released at last ; so 
that they were twelve in all, besides five we kept prisoners 
in the cave for hostages* I asked the captain if he was 
willing to venture with these hands on board the ship ; 
for as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was 
proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind, and 
it was employment enough for us to keep them asunder 
and supply them with victuals* As to the five in the cave, 
I resolved to keep them fast ; but Friday went in twice a 



'&DVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 123 

day to them, to supply them with necessaries, and I made 
the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where 
Friday was to take it. When I showed myself to the two 
hostages, it was with the captain, who told them I was 
the person the governor had ordered to look after them, and 
that it was the governor’s pleasure they should not stir 
anywhere but by my direction ; that if they did, they 
should be fetched into the castle, and be laid in irons ; so 
that as we never suffered them to see me as governor, I 
now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor, 
the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions. 

The captain now had no difficulty before him but to 
furnish his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them. 
He made his passenger captain of one, with four other men ; 
and himself, and his mate, and five more went in the other. 
About midnight they came within call of the ship. He 
made Robinson hail them, and tell them they brought off 
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before 
they had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat 
till they came to the ship's side ; when the captain and the 
mate entering first, with their arms, immediately knocked 
down the second mate and carpenter with the butt-end 
of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their 
men. They secured all the rest that were upon the main 
and quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to keep 
them down who were below ; when the other boat and 
their men entering at the fore-chains, secured the fore- 
castle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the 
cook-room, making three men they found there prisoners. 
When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain 
ordered the mate, with three men, to break into the round- 
house, where the new rebel captain by, and having taken 
the alarm, was gotten up, and with two men and a boy had 
gotten firearms in their hands. Then the mate with a 
crow split open the door, but the new captain and his men 
fired boldly among them, , and wounded the mate with a 



124 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

musket-ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more 
of the men, but killed nobody. The mate calling for help, 
rushed into the round-house wounded as he was, and with 
his pistol shot the new captain through the head, the 
bullet entering at his mouth and coming out again behind 
one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word ; upon which 
the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually. 

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered 
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon 
with me to give me notice of his success, which you may 
be sure I was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon 
the shore for it till near two of the clock in the morning. 
Then I laid me down ; and it having been a day of great 
fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was something sur- 
prised with the noise of another gun ; and starting up, I 
heard a man call me : 44 Governor/' “ Governor ; " when 
climbing up to the top of the hill, there stood the captain, 
and pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms. 
44 My dear friend and deliverer/' says he, 44 there's your 
ship, for she is all yours, and so are we, and all that belong 
to her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she rode 
within little more than half a mile of the shore ; for they 
had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, 
and the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor 
just against the mouth of the little creek, and the tide being 
up, the captain had brought the pinnace in and lahded 
just at my door. I was at first ready to sink down with 
surprise ; for I saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put 
into my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just ready 
to carry me away whither I pleased to go. At first, for 
some time, I was not able to answer him one word ; but 
as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I 
should have fallen to the ground. He perceived the sur- 
prise, and immediately pulls a bottle out of his pocket, 
and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought bn 
purpose for me. After I had drank it, I sat down upon the 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 135 

ground ; and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a 
good while before Icould speak a word to him* All this while 
the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I, only not under 
any surprise, as I was* He said a thousand kind tender 
things to me, to compose me and bring me to myself ; 
but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my 
spirits into confusion* At last it broke out into tears, 
and in a little while after I recovered my speech* Then 
I took my turn, and embraced him as my deliverer, and 
we rejoiced together* I told him I looked upon him as 
a man sent from heaven to deliver me* 

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had 
brought me some little refreshment, such as the ship 
afforded, and such as the wretches that had been so long 
his masters had not plundered him of* Upon this he 
called aloud to the boat, and bid his men bring the things 
ashore that were for the governor ; and, indeed, it was a 
present as if I had been one, not that was to be carried away 
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell upon the 
island still, and they were to go without me* First, he 
had brought me a case of bottles full of excellent cordial, 
six large bottles of Madeira wine (the bottles held two 
quarts apiece), -two pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve 
pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag 
of peas, and about a hundredweight of biscuit* Also a box 
of sugar, a box of flour, a bag of lemons, and two bottles of 
lime-juice, and abundance of other things; but besides 
these, and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he 
brought me six clean new shirts, six very good neck-cloths, 
two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one pair 
of stockings, and a very good suit oi clothes of his own, 
which had been worn but very little ; in a word, he clothed 
me from head to foot* It was a very kind and agreeable 
present, as any one may imagine, to one in my circum- 
stances ; but never was anything in the world so awkward 
and uneasy, as it was to me to wear such clothes* 



126 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

After these ceremonies passed, we began to consult 
what was to be done with the prisoners ; for it was worth 
considering whether we might venture to take them away 
with us or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to 
be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree ; and 
the captain said he knew they were such rogues, that there 
was no obliging them ; and if he did carry them away, it 
must be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered over to 
justice at the first English colony he could come at ; and 
I found that the captain himself was very anxious about it* 
Upon this I told him that, if he desired it, I durst under- 
take to bring the two men he spoke of to make it their own 
request that he should leave them upon the island* 44 I 
should be very glad of that,” says the captain , u with all my 
heart.” “ Well,” says I, “ I will send for them and talk 
with them for you*” So I caused Friday and the two 
hostages to go to the cave and bring up the five men, 
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there 
till I came* After some time I came thither, dressed in my 
new habit ; and now I was called governor again* Being 
all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men to be 
brought before me, and I told them I had had a full account 
of their villainous behaviour to the captain* and how they 
had run away with the ship, and were preparing to commit 
farther robberies, but that Providence had ensnared them 
in their own ways, and that they were fallen into the pit 
which they had digged for others. I let them know that by 
my direction the ship had been seized, that she lay now in 
the road, and they might see, by and by, that their new 
captain had received the reward of his villainy, for that 
they might see him hanging at the yard-arm ; that as to 
them, I wanted to know what they had to say why I should 
not execute them as pirates, taken in the fact, as by my 
commission they could not doubt I had authority to do* 

I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they 
thought they could shift on shore* They seemed very 



ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE xvj 

thankful for it, said they would much rather venture to 
stay there than to be carried to England to be hanged ; 
so I left it on that issue. But the captain seemed to main 
some difficulty of it, as if he durst not leave them there 
Upon this I seemed a little angry with the captain, and tolc 
him that they were my prisoners, not his ; and that seeing 
I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good su 
my word ; and that if he did not think fit to consent to it 
I would set them at liberty as I found them ; and if h< 
did not like it, he might take them again if he could catcl 
them. Upon this they appeared very thankful, and 1 
accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire int< 
the woods to the place whence they came, and I would leavi 
them some firearms, some ammunition, and some direo 
tions how they should live very well, if they thought fit. 

Upon this I told the captain that I would stay that nigh 
to prepare my things, and desired him to go on board ii 
the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send th 
boat on shore the next day for me ; ordering him, in th 
meantime, to cause the new captain, who was killed, t< 
be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men might see him 
When the captain was gone, I sent for the men again, an< 
entered seriously into discourse with them. . I told then 
I thought they had made a right choice that if the captaii 
carried them away, they would certainly be hanged, 
showed them the new captain hanging at the yard-arm c 
the ship, and told them they had nothing less to expeci 
When they had all declared their willingness to stay, 
told them the story of my living there, and put them int 
the way of making it easy to them. I gave them the whol 
history of the place, and of my coming to it, showed ther 
my fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted m 
corn, cured my grapes ; and in a word, all that was neces 
sary to mike them easy. I told them the story also of th 
sixteen Spaniards that were to be expected, for whom 
left a letter, and made them promise to treat them 1 



128 ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE 

common with themselves. I left them my firearms and 
three swords, and gave them a description of the way I 
managed the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, 
and to make both butter and cheese. In a word, I gave 
them every part of my own story, and I told them I would 
prevail with the captain to leave them two barrels of gun- 
powder more, and some garden seeds, which I told them 
I would have been very glad of. 

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on 
board the ship. The next morning early two of the five 
men came swimming to the ship’s side, and making a most 
lamentable complaint of the other three, begged to be taken 
into the ship for God's sake, for they should be murdered, 
and begged the captain to take them on board, though he 
hanged them immediately. Upon this the captain pre- 
tended to have no power without me; but after some 
difficulty, and after their solemn promises of amendment, 
they were token on board, and were soundly whipped and 
pickled, after which they proved honest and quiet fellows. 

When I and Friday took leave of this island, I carried on- 
board, for relics, the great goatskin cap I had made, my 
umbrella, and my parrot ; also I forgot not to take the 
money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me so long 
useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could 
hardly pass for silver till it had been rubbed and handled ; 
as also the money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship. 

And thus I left the island, the 19th of December, as I 
found by the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had 
been upon it eight and twenty years, two months, and 
nineteen days, being delivered from this second captivity 
the same day of the month that I first made my escape 
from among the Moors of Sallee. In this vessel, after a 
long voyage, I arrived in England, the nth of June, in the 
year 1687, having been thirty and five years absent.
