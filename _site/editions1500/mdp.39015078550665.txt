THE LIFE
SURPRISING ADVENTURES
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I was born in the year 1632, in the
city of York, of a good family, though
not of that country, my father being a
foreigner of Bremen, who settled first
at Hull. He got a good estate by mer-
chandise, and leaving off his trade,
lived afterwards at York; from whence
he had married my mother, whose re-
lations were named Robinson, a very
good family in that country, and from
whom 1 was called Robinson Kreutz-
naer; but, by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called,
nay, we call ourselves, and write our
name, Crusoe; and so my companions
always called me.
I had two elder brothers, one of
whom was lieutenant-colonel to an
English regiment of foot in Flanders,
formerly commanded by the famous
Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at
the battle near Dunkirk against the
Spaniards. What became of my second
brother, I never knew, any more than
my father and mother did know what
was become of me.
Being the third son of the family,
and not bred to any trade, my head be-
gan to J^e filled very early with ramb-
ling thoughts. My father, (who was
very ancient) had given me a compe-
tent share of learning, as far as house-
education and a country free-school
generally go, and designed me for the
law; but I would be satisfied with no-
thing but going to sea: and my incli-
nation to this led me so strongly against
the will, nay, the commands, of my fa-
ther, and against all the entreaties and
persuasions of my mother and other
friends, that there seemed to be some-
thing fatal in that propenstonof nature,
tending directly to the life of misery
which was to befall me.
My father, a wise and grave man,
gave me serious and excellent counsel
against what he foresaw was my de-
sign. He called me one morning into
his chamber, where he was confined by
the gout, and expostulated very warm-
ly with me upon this subject: he asked
me what reasons, more than a mere
wandering inclination, 1 had for leav-
ing his house, and my native country,
where I might be well introduced, and
had a prospect of raising my for-
tune by application and industry,
with a life of ease and pleasure. lie
told me it was for men of desperate
fortunes, on one hand, or of aspiring
superior fortunes, on the other, who
went abroad upon adventures, to rise
by enterprise, and make themselves fa-
mous in undertakings of a nature out
of the common road; that these things
were all either top far above me, or too
far below me; that mine was the middle
state, or what might be called the upper
station of low life, which he had found
by long experience, was the best state
in the world, the most suited to hu-
man happiness not exposed to the mi-
series and hardships, the labour and
sufferings of the mechanic part of man-
kind, and not embarrassed with tki
pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of
the upper part of mankind: he told
me, } might judge of the happiness of
this state by one thing, viz. that this
was the state of life which all other
people envied; that kings have fre-
quently lamented the miserable conse-

ADVENTURE* OF
quenees of being born to great things,
arid wished they had been placed in the
middle of two extremes, between the
mean and the great; that the wise man
gave his testimony to this, as the just
standard of true felicity, when he prayed
to have neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should
always find, that the calamities of life
were shared among the upper and
lower part of mankind; but that the
middle station had the fewest disasters,
and was not exposed to so many vicis-
situdes as the higher or lower part of
mankind: nay, they were not subjected
to so many distempers and uneasi-
nesses, either of body or mind, as those
were, who, by vicious living, luxury,
and extravagancies, on one hand, or by
hard labour, want of necessaries, and
mean and insufficient diet, on the other
hand, bring distempers upon them-
selves by the natural consequences of
their way of living; that the middle
station of life was calculated for all
kind of virtues, and all kind of enjoy-
ments; that peace and plenty were the
handmaids of a middle fortune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness,
health, society, all agreeable diver-
sions, and all desirable pleasures, were
the hlessings attending the middle sta-
tion of life; that this way men went si-
lently and smoothly through the world,
and comfortably out of it, not embar-
rassed with the labours of the Hands or
of the head, not sold to the life of sla-
very for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob
the soul of peace, and the body of
rest; not enraged with the passion of
envy, or secret burning lust of ambi-
ffon for great things; but, in easy cir-
cumstances, sliding gently through the
world, and sensibly tasting the sweets
pf living, without the bitter; feeling
that they are happy, and learning by
every da*y*s experience, tolcnow it more
sensibly.
After this,he pressed me earnestly,aod
In the most affectionate manner, not to
play the young man, nor to precipitate
myself into miseries which nature, and
the station of life I was born in,seemed to
hwh provided against; that I was under
rid' necessity of seeking my bread; that
he would do well for^ me, and endea-
vour to enter me foirly into the station
of lift*- which he had been just recom-
mending to me; and that if I was not
very easy and happy in the world, it
must be my mere fate, or fault, that
must hinder it; and that he should
have nothing to answer for, haying
thus discharged his duty in warning me
against measures which he knew would
be to my hurt: in a word, that as he
would do very kind things for me if I
would stay and settle at home as he
directed; so he would not have so much
hand in my misfortunes as to give me
any encouragement to go away: and,
to close all, he told me I had my elder
brother for an example, to whom he
had used the same earnest persuasions
to keep him from going into the Low
Country wars, but could not prevail,
his young desires prompting him to
run "into the army, where he was killed;
and though, he said, he would not
cease to pray for me, yet he would
venture to say to me, that if I did take
this foolish step, God would not bless
me; and I would have leisure, hereafter,
to reflect upon having neglected his
counsel, when there might be none to
assist in my recovery.
I observed, in this last part of his
discourse, which was truly prophetic,
though, 1 suppose, my father did not
know it to he so himself; I say, L ob-
served the tears run down his face very
plentifully, especially when he spoke
of my brother who was killed; and
that, when he spoke of my having lei-
sure to repent, and none to assist me,
He was so moved, that he broke of the
discourse, and told me his heart was
so full, he could say no more to me. -
I was sincerely affected with thw dis-
course; as, indeed, who could lie other-
wise? and I resolved not to think of
going abroad any more, but to settle
at home, according,to my lather's de-
sire. But alas! a few days wore it all
off; and, in short, to prevent any of
my father's further importunities, in
a few weeks after I resolved to run
quite away from him. However, I did
not act so hastily, neither, as my first
Jieat of i«es®lution prompted; but I
took my mother, at a time when I
thought her a tittle pleasanter than or-
dinary, and told her that my thoughts
 
were so entirely bent upon seeing the
world that I should never settle to any
thing1 with resolution enough to go
through with it, and my rather had
better give me his consent than force
me to go without it j that I was now
eighteen years oldj which was too late
to- go apprentice to a trade, or clerk
to an attorney; that I was sure, if
I did, I should never serve out my
lime, and I should certainly run away
from my master before my time was
©ut, ant) go to sea; and if she would
speak to my father to let roe make but
one voyage abroad, if I came home
again, and did not like it, I would go
ao more; and I would promise, by a
double diligence, to recover the time
I had lost.
This put my mother into a great
passion: she told me she knew it
would be to no purpose to speak to
my father upon any such a subject;
that he knew too well what was my
interest to give his consent to any
tiring so much for my hurt; and that
she wandered how I could think of
any such thing, after such a discourse
as I had from my father, and such
kind and tender expressions as she
knew my father bad used to me: and
that, m short, if I would ruin myself,
there was no help for me; but I might
depend I should never have their con-
sent toit: that for her part, she would
not have so much hand in my destruc-
tion; and 1 should never have it to
say, that my mother was willing when
my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move
it to my father, yet, as I have heard
afterwards, she reported all the dis-
course to him; and that my father,
after shewing a great concern at it,
said to her with a sigh, That boy
might be happy, if he would stay at
home; but if he goes abroad, he will
he the most miserable wretch that
ever was born: I can give no consent
toit.
It was not till almost a year after
tMs that I broke loose; though in the
tiftean time I continued obstinately deaf
to all proposals of settling to business,
and frequently expostulating with my
father and mother about their being
so positively determined ag*iti«* what
they knew my inclinations prompted
me to. But, being one day at null,
whither I went casually, and without
any purpose of making an elopement
at that time, and one of my com-
panions then going to London by sea
in his father's ship, and prompting me
to go with them by the common allure-
ment of sea-faring men, viz. that it
should cost me nothing for my passage,
1 consulted neither father nor mother
any more, nor so much as sent them
word of it; but left them to hear of it
as they might, without asking God's
blessingor my father's, without any con-
sideration of circumstances or conse-
quences, and in an ill hour, God knows.
On the 1st of September, 1651, I
went on board a ship bound for Lon-
don. Never any youne: adventurer's
misfortunes, I believe, Degan earlier,
Or continued longer, than mine. The
ship had no sooner got out of the
Humber, than the wind began to blow,
and the waves to rise, in a most fright-
ful manner; and as I had never been
at sea before, I was most inexpressi-
bly sick in body, and terrified in mind:
I began now seriously to reflect upon
what I had done, and how justly I
was overtaken by the judgment of
heaven, for wickedly leaving my fa-
ther's house, and abandoning my duty.
All the good counsel of my parents,
my father's tears, my mother's en-
treaties, came now fresh into my mind;
and my conscience, which was not yet
come to the pitch of hardiness to
which it has been since, reproached
me with the contempt of advice, and
the breach of my duty to God and my
father.
All this while the storm increased,
and the sea which I had never been
upon before, went very high, though
nothing like what I have seen many
times since, no nor what I saw a few
days after; but, such as it was, enough
to affect me then, who was but a
young sailor, and had never known
any tiling of the matter. I expected
every wave would have swallowed us
up, and that every time the ship, fiift
down, as I thought, In the trbtigfi b*
hollow of the sea we should iie^ rife
more; and in this agony o£ mliid*; 1
made many Vows and resolution** jtifiit
if it would please God t0 8pare my life
this voyage, if ever I got my foot once
on dry land, I would go directly home
to my father, and never set it into a
ship again while I lived; that I would
take his advice, and never run myself
into such miseries as these any more.
Now I saw plainly the goodness of his
observations about the middle station
of life; how easy, how comfortable he
had lived all his days, and never had
been exposed to tempests at sea or
troubles on shore; and I resolved
that I would, like a true repenting
prodigal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts con-
tinued during the storm, and indeed
some time after; but the next day, as
the wind was abated, and the sea
calmer, I began to be a little inured
to it. However I was very grave that
day being also a little sea-sick still:
but towards night the weather cleared
up, the wind was quite over, and a
charming fine evening followed; the
sun went down perfectly clear and rose
so the next morning; and having little
or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as I
thought, the most delightful that I
ever saw.
I had slept well in the night, and
was now no more sea-sick, but very
cheerful, looking with wonder upon
the sea that was so rough and terrible
the day before, and could be so calm
and pleasant in a little time after.
And now, lest my good resolutions
should continue, my companion who
had indeed enticed me away, came to
me and said, Well, Bob, clapping me
on the shoulder, how do you do after
it? I warrant you were frightened,
wair*t you, last night, when it blew but
a cap-full of wind?—A cap-full, do
you call it? said I, 'twas a terrible
«tonn.—A storm you fool! replies he,
do you call that a storm? Why, it was
nothing at all; give us but a good ship
find sea-room, and we think nothing
of suck a squall of wind as that: you
are bm a fresh-water sailor, Bob;
come, let us make a bowl of punch,
an& we'll forget all that. D'ye see
.whatcharming weather 'tis now? To
SH&ake short this sad part of my
mtoryv w went the way of all sailors;
the punch was made, and I was made
drunk with it; and in that one night's
wickedness I drowned all my repen-
tance, all my reflections upon my past
conduct, and ail my resolutions for the
future. In a word, as the sea was
returned to its smoothness of surface
and settled cjjlmness by the abatement
of the storm, so the hurry of my
thoughts being over, my fears and
apprehensions of being swallowed
up by the sea forgotten, and the cur-
rent of my former desires returned, I
entirely forgot the vows and pro-
mises I had made in my distress. I
found, indeed, some intervals of re-
flection; and serious thoughts, did, as
it were, endeavour to return again
sometimes; but I shook them off, and
roused myself from them, as it were
from a distemper, and, applying my-
self to drink and company, soon master-
ed the return of those fits,—for so I
called them; and I had in five or six
days got as complete a victory over
conscience as any young fellow, that
resolved not to be troubled with it,
could desire. But I was to have
another trial for it still; and Provi-
dence, as in such cases generally it
does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse; for if I would not take
this for a deliverance, the next was to be
such a one as the worst and most hard-
ened wretch among us would confess
both the danger and the mercy of. The
sixth day of our being at sea, we came
into Yarmouth roads; the wind
having been contrary, and the weather
calm, we had made but little way since
the storm. Here we were obliged to
come to an anchor, and here we lay,
the wind continuing contrary, viz. at
south-west, for seven or eight days,
during which time a great many ships
from Newcastle came into the same
roads, as the common harbour where
the ship3 might wait for a wind for the
river. We had not, however, rid here
so long, but we should have tided up
the river, but that the wind blew too
fresh; and after we had lain four
or five days, blew very hard. However,
the roads beiag reckoned as good as
a harbour, the anchorage good, and
our ground tackle very strong* our
ineii were unconcerned, and not in the
(east apprehensive of danger, but
spent the time in rest and mirth, after
the manner of the sea. But the eighth
day, in the morning, the wind increased
and we had ail hands at work to strike
our topmasts, and majte every thing
snug and close, that the ship might
ride as easy as possible. By noon the
sea went very high indeed, and our
ship rode forecastle in, shipped several
seas, and we thought, once or twice,
our anchor had come home; upon
which our master ordered out the
sheet anchor j so that we rode with
two anchors a-head, and the cables
veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm
indeed; and now I began to see terror
and amazement in the faces of even
the seamen themselves. The master
was vigilant in the business of preserv-
ing the ship; but as he went in and out
of his cabin by me, I could hear him
softly say to himself several times,
"Lord, be merciful to us; we shall be
all lost; we shall be all undone!" and
the like. During these first hurries I
was stupid, lying still in my cabin,
which was in the steerage, and cannot
describe my temper. I could ill re-
assume the first penitence, which I had
so apparently trampled upon, and har-
dened myself against; I thought that
the bitterness of death had been passed,
and that this would be nothing too, like
the first: but when the master himself
came by me, as I said just now, and
said we should be all lost, I was dread-
fully frightened. I got up out of my
cabin, and looked out; but such a
dismal sight I never saw; the sea went
mountains high, and broke upon us
every three or four minutes. When I
could look about, I could see nothing
but distress around us; two ships, that
rid near us, we found had cut their
masts by the board, being deeply la-
den ; and our men cried out that a ship
which rid about a mile a-head of us,
was foundered. Two more ships,
being driven from their anchors, were
run out of the roads to sea, at all
adventures, and that with not a mast
standing. The light ships fared the
best, as not so much labouring in
the sea; but two or three of them
. drove, and came close by us, running
away, with only their sprit sails out,
before the wind. Toward evening,
the mate, and boatswain begged the
master of our ship to let tnem cut
away the foremast, which he was very
loth to do; but the boatswain protest,
ing to him, that if he did not the ship
would founder, he consented; and
when they had cut away the foremast,
the mainmast stood so loose and shook
the ship so much, they were obliged to
cut it away also, and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition
I must be in at all this, who was but
a young sailor, and who had been in
such a fright before at but a little.
But if I can express, at this distance,
the thoughts I had about me at that
time, I was in tenfold more horror of
mind upon account of my former
convictions, and the having returned
from them to the resolutions I had
wickedly taken at first, than I was at
death itself; and these, added to the
terror of the storm, put me intasueh
a condition, that I can by no words
describe it, but the worst was not
come yet; the storm continued with
such fury that the seamen themselves
acknowledged they had never known
a worse. We had a good ship, but
she was deep laden, and so wallowed
in the sea, that the seamen every now
and then cried out she would founder.
It was my advantage, in one respect,
that I did not know what they meant
by founder, till I inquired. However,
the storm was so violent, that I saw,
what is not often seen, the master, the
boatswain and some others, more sen-
sible than the rest, at their prayers, and
expecting every moment the ship
would go to the bottom. In the mid-
dle of the night, and under all the rest
of our distresses, one of the men, that
had been down on purpose to see, cried
out, we had sprung a leak; another
said, there was four feet water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to
the pump. At that very word, my
heart, as I thought, died within me;
and I fell backwards upon the side of
my bed where I sat in the cabin. How-
ever, the men roused me, and told roe,
that I, who was able to do nothing be-
fore, was as well able to pump as
another: at which I stirred up and
b 4
jum:xTuiu& of
vy^it^tv theaminp, and worked very
heartily. While this was doing, tiii
JpaasWr seeing some light colliers who,
not able to ride out the. storm, were
t*Uliged to slip and run away to sea,
and \Kould not come near us, ordered
iisto fire a guu, as a signal of distress.
I, >yho kn$w nothing what that meant*
\\ip so surprised, that I thought the
shji) had bro£e, or some dreadful thing
had happened. In a word, 1 was so
surprised, that I fell down in a swoon.
As this was a time when every body
had His own life to think of, no one
minded me, or what was become of
me: but another man stepped up to
the pump, and thrusting me aside with
his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been
dead • and it was a great while before
I came to myself.
We vvorked on; but the water in-
ci:easW in the hold, it was apparent
that the ship would founder; and
though the storm began to abate a
little, yet as it was not possible she
could swim till we might run into a
port* so the master continued firing
gtLas for help; and a light ship, who
bapl rid it out just a-head of us, ven-
tured a boat out to help us. It was
with the utmost hazard the boat came
near us, but it was impossible for us
tp get on board, or for the boat to lie
near the .ship's side;.till at last the
men, xowing very heartily, and ven*.
tiirujg theirlives to save ours, our men
ciai them a rope over the stem with a
buoy to it, and then veered it out a
great lengthy vvbich they, after great
nujoiu: and hazard, took hold of, and
we. hauled ihem close under our stern,
aiui got all into their boat. It was
to jao,pujrpose for them or us, after we
were in the boat, to thkik of reaching
tjieir own ship; so all agreed to let
l^rjtdriv.e, and only to pull her in to-
.v$p&$ shore as much as we could; and
oar naaster promised them, that if the
bpirt wasstaved upon shore, he would
«$ke<it gopij to theirroasterj so partly
rowing, and partly (hiving, our boat
went away to the northward, sloping
towards the shore almost as far as
l^mt^rton-lsfess. , ,
jjgfe/were not much more thai* a
quarter of an hour out of our ship
w^en, we saw her^ififc; and then I
understood, for the ftrst time, what
was meant by a ship foundering in the
sea. I must acknowledge, I haci hardly
eyes to look tip when the seam eh told
me* she was sinking; fbr, from that
moment, they rather put me into the
boat, than that I might be said to go
in. My heart was, as it were, dead
within me, partly with fright, partly
with horror of mind, and the thought's
of what was yet before ine.
While we were in this condition, the
men yet labouring at the oar to bring
the boat near the shore, we could see
(when, our boat mounting the Waves,
we were able to see the shore) a great
many people running along the strand,
to assist us when we should come near;
but we made slow way towards the
shore; nor were we able to reach it,
til), being past the light-house at Win-
terton, the shore falls off to the west-
ward, towards Cromer, and so the land
broke of! a little the violence of the
wind. Here we got in, and, though
not without much difficulty, got all
safe on shore, and walked afterwards
on foot to Yarmouth; where, as unfor-
tunate men, we were used with great
humanity, as well by the magistrates
of the town, who assigned us good
quarters, as by the particular mer-
chants and owners of ships; and had
money given us sufficient to carry us
either to London or back to Hull, as
we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to haye
gone back to Hull, and have gone
home, I had been happy; and my
father, an emblem of our blessed Sa-
viour's parable, had even killed the*
fatted calf for me; fbr, h&Lrfhg the
ship I went in was cast away in Yar-
mouth roads, it .was a great while
before he bad any assurance that I
was not drowned. - -
Btit my ill lute pushed me on with
an obstinacy that nothing could resist •
and though I had several times loud
calls from mjr reason, and ttif mor£
composed judgment, to go hoiiie, yet
I had no power to d© it~l know 6$t
what to call this, nor will I urge that It
is a secret, uver-raling decree, that
hurries «s on to be the instruments of
ou*«wrides^uction,€ven though it be
before us, and that we rush upon it
U with *>ar eyes open. Certainly,
nothing but some such decreed un-
avoidable misery attending, and which
it was impossible for me to escape,
could have pushed me forward against
the calm reasonings and persuasions
of my most retired thoughts, and
against two such visible instructions as
lirad met with in my first attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to
harden me before, and who was the
master's son, was now less forward
than I: the first time he spoke to me
after we were at Yarmouth, which was
not till two or three days, for we were
separated in the town to several quar-
ters 5 I say, the first time he saw me, it
appeared his tone was altered, and,
looking very melancholy, and shaking
his head, asked me how I did: telling
h*i3 father who I was, and how I had
come this voyage only for a trial, in
order to go farther abroad. His father,
turning to me, with a grave and con-
cerned tone, Young man, says he, you
ought never to go to sea any more;
you ought to take this for a plain and
visible token, that you are not to be a
sea-faring man.—-why, sir? said I;
will you go to sea no more ?—That is
another case, said he; it is my calling,
and therefore my duty; but as you
made this voyage for a trial, you see
what a taste Heaven has given you of
what you are to expect if you persist.
Perhaps this has all befallen us on your
account, like Jonah in the ship of Tar-
shish.—Pray, continues he, what are
you, and on what account did you go to
sea? Upon that I told him some of my
story; at the end of which he burst out
with a strange kind of passion. What
had I done, said he, that such an un-
happy wretch should come into my ship!
I would not set my foot in the same
ship wkh thee again for # thousand
pounds. This indeed was, as I said,
an excursion of his spirits, which were
yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and
was farther than he could have autho-
rity to go.—However, he afterwards
tajked very gravely to me; exhorted
me to go back to my father, and not
tempt Providence to my ruin; told
me, I might see a visible hand of
Heaven against me; and, young man,
said heJ depend upon it, if you do not
go back, wherever you go, you will
meet with nothing but disasters and
disappointments, till your father's words
are fulfilled upon you.
We parted soon after, for I made him
little answer, and I saw him no more;
which way he went, I know not: as for
me, having some money in my pocket,
I travelled to London by land; and
there, as well as on the road, had many
struggles with myself what course "of
life I should take, and whether I should
go home or go to sea. As to going
home, shame opposed the best motions
that offered to my thoughts; and it
immediately occurred to me how I
should be laughed at among the neigh-
bours, and should be ashamed to see,
not my father and mother only, but
even every body else. From whence I
have often since observed, how incon-
gruous and irrational the common
temper of mankind is, especial lv of
youth, to that reason which ought to
guide them in such cases, viz. that they
are not ashamed to sin, and yet are
ashamed to repent; not ashamed of
the action, for which they ought justly
to be esteemed fools; but are ashamed
of the returning, which only can make
them be esteemed wise men.
In this state of life, however, I re-
mained some time, uncertain what
measures to take, and what course of
life to lead. An irresistable reluctance
continued to going home; and as 1
stayed awhile, the remembrance of the
distress I had been in wore off; and, as
that abated, the little motion I had in
my desires to a return wore off with it,
till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts
of it, and looked out for a voyage.
That evil influence which carried me
first away from my father's house, that
hurried me into the wild and indigested
notion of raising my fortune, and that
impressed those conceits so forcibly
upon me, as to make me deaf to afl
good advice, and to the entreaties, and
even the commands of my father; I say
the same influence, whatever it was,
presented the most unfortunate of all
enterprises to my view; and I went oa
board a vessel bound to the coast of
Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call
it, a voyage to Guinea,
It was my great misfortune, that m
w
ADVENTURES OF
all these adventures ! did not ship
myself as a sailor; whereby, though I
might indeed have worked a little
harder than ordinary, yet, at the same
time, I had learned the duty and office
of a foremast-man, and in time might
have qualified myself for a mate or
lieutenant, if not a master: but as it
was always my fate to choose for the
worse, so I did here; for having money
in my pocket, and good clothes upon
my back, I would always go on board
In the habit of a gentleman; and so I
neither had any business in the ship,
nor learned to do any. It was my lot,
first of all, to fall into pretty good
company in London; which does not
always happen to such loose and mis-
guided young fellows as I then was;
the devil, generally, not omitting to lay
some snare for them very curly. But
it was not so with me: I first fell ac-
quainted with the master of a ship,
who had been on the coast of Guinea,
and who, having had very good success
there, was resolved to go again. He,
taking a fancy to my conversation,
which was not at all disagreeable at
that time, and hearing me say I had a
mind to see the world, told me that if
I would go the voyage with him, I
should be at no expense ,* I should be
his mess-mate and his companion;
and if I could carry any thing with me,
I should have all ,the advantage of it
that the trade would admit; and per-
haps I might meet with some encou-
ragement. I embraced the offer, and,
entering into a strict friendship with
this captain, who was an honest and
'plain-dealing man, I went the voyage
with him, and carried a small adven-
ture with me; which by the disinter-
ested honesty of my friend the captain,
I increased very considerably; for I
carried about 40/. in such toys and
trifles as the captain directed me to
buy. This 40/. I had mustered to-
gether by the assistance of some of my
relations whom I corresponded with;
and who, I believe, got my father, or,
at least, my mother, to contribute so
much as that to my first adventure.
/This was the only voyage which I may
sdy was successful in all my adventures,
ana which I owe to the integrity and
hutiesty of my friend the captain; under
whom also I got a competent know-
ledge of the mathematics and the rules
of navigation, learned how to keep an
account of the ship's course, take an
observation, and, in short, to under-
stand some things that were needful to
be understood by a sailor: for, as he
took delight to instruct me, I took
delight to learn: and, in a word, this
voyage made me both a sailor and a
merchant: for I brought home 51b.
1) oz. of gold-dust for my adventure,
which yielded me in London, at my
return, "almost 300/. and this filled me
with those aspiring thoughts which
have since so completed my ruin. Yet
even in this voyage I had my misfor-
tunes too; particularly, that I was con-
tinually sick, being thrown into a
violent calenture by the excessive heat
of the climate; our principle trading
being upon the coast, from the latitude
of 15 degrees north, even to the line
itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea
trader; and my friend, to my great
misfortuue, dying soon after his arrival,
I resolved to go the same voyage again;
and I embarked in the same vessel
with one who was his mate in the for-
mer voyage, and had now got the com-
mand of the ship. This" was the un-
happiest voyage that ever man made;
for though I did not carry quite 100/.
of my new-gained wealth, so that I
had 200/. left, and which I lodged witn
my friend's widow, who was very just
'to me, yet I fell into terrible misfor-
tunes in this voyage: and the first was
this, viZi—our ship, making her course
towards the Canary Islands, or rather
between those Islands and the African
shore, was surprised, in the grey of
the morning, by a Turkish rover of
Sallee, who gave chase to us with all
the sail sh# could make. We crowded
also as much canvas as our yards
woulid spread, or our masts carry, to
get clear; but finding the pirate gained
upon us, and would certainly come tip
with us in a few hours, we prepared to
fight, our ship having 12 guns, and the
rover 18. About three in the afternoon
he came up with us; and bringing to,
by mistake, just athwart our quarter,
instead of athwart our stem, as he
intended, we brought eight of our gulls
11
t<*. bear on that side, and poured in a
broadside upon, him, which made him
sheer off again, after returning" our fire,
and pouring in also his small shot
from near 200 men which he had on
board. However, we^ had not a man
touched, all our men keeping close.
He prepared to attack us again, and
we to defend ourselves; but laying us
on board the next time upon our other
quarter, he entered 60 men upon our
decks, who immediately fell to cutting
and hacking the sails and rigging. We
plied them with small shot, half-pikes,
powder-chests, and such like, and
cleared our deck of them twice. How-
ever, to cut short this melancholy part
of our story, our ship being disabled,
and three of our men killed and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and
were carried all prisoners into Sallee, a
port belonging to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so
dreadful as at first I apprehended; nor
was I carried up the country to the
emperor's court, as the rest of our men
were, but was kept by the captain of
the rover as his proper prize, and made
his slave, being young and nimble, and
fit for his business. At this surprising
change of my circumstances, from a
merchant to a miserable slave, I was
perfectly overwhelmed; and now I
looked back upon ray father's prophe-
tic discourse to me, that I should be
miserable, and have none to relieve
me; which I thought was now so ef-
fectually brought to pass, that it could
not be worse; that now the hand of
heaven had overtaken me, and I was
undone, without redemption. But,
alas! this was but a taste of the mi-
sery I was to go through, as will ap-
pear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron, or master, had
taken me home to his house, so I was
in hopes he would take me with him
whpn he went to sea again, believing
that it would, some time or other, be
Siis fate to beJtaken by a Spanish or
Portuguese man of war, and that then
I should be set at liberty. But this
hope of mine was soon taken away;
For when he went to sea, he left me on
shore, to look after his little garden,
and do the common drudgery o? slaves
ajwut hi* house; and when he. came
home again from his cruise, he ordered
me to lie in the cabin, to look after the
ship.
Here I meditated nothing but my es-
cape, and what method I might take to
effect it, but found no way that had the
least probability in it. Nothing pre-
sented to make the supposition of it
rational; for I had nobody to commu-
nicate it to that would embark with
me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman,
Irishman, or Scotchman there but my-
self; so that for two years, though I
often pleased myself with the imagina^-
tion, yet I never had the least encou-
raging prospect of putting it in practice.
After about two years, an odd cir-
cumstance presented itself, which put
the old thought of making some atr
tempt for my liberty again in my head.
My patron lying at home longer than
usual, without fitting out his ship,
which, as I heard, was for want of mo-
ney, he used constantly, once or twice
a week, sometimes oftener, if the wea-
ther was fair, to take the ship's pin-
nace, and go out into the road a*fish-
ing; and as he always took me and a
young Moresco with him to row the
boat, we made him very merry, and I
proved very dexterous in catching fish,
insomuch that sometimes he would
send me with a Moor, one of his kins*
men, and the youth, the Moresco, aa
they called him, to catch a dish of fish
for him.
It happened one time, that going a-
fishing in a stark calm morning, a fog
rose so thick, that though we were not
half a league from the shore, we lost
sigh* of it; and rowing, tve knew not
whither, or which way, we laboured alt
day and all the next night, and when
the morning came, we found we had
pulled off to sea, instead of pulling m
for the shore, and that we were at least
two leagues from the shore: however
we got well in again, though with &
great deal of labour, and some danger,
for the wind began to blow pretty fresh
in the mornings but particularly we
were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned' by th& d»-
aster, resolved. to take more* care '•¥
himself for the future; and having ly^
rag by Mm the longboat of our Eag^
fish snip he had taken, he -resolved a^'
15
ADVENTURES-OF
would not go a-fishing any more with-
out a, compass and some provision; sO
he ordcrea the carpenter of the ship,
w&o was an English stare, to build a
little state room or cabin in the middle
of the long boat, like that of a barge,
with a place to stand behind it, to steer
and haul home the main sheet, and
room before for a hand or two to stand
and work the sails. She sailed with
what we call a shoulder-of-mu?ton sail,
and the boom jibbed over the top of
the cabin, which lay very snug and Low,
and had in it room for him to lie, with
a slave or two, and a table to eat on,
with some small lockers to put in some
bottles of such liquor as he thought fit
to drink, and particularly his bread, rice,
and coffee.
We went frequently out with this
boat a-fisbing, and as I was most dex-
terous to catch fish for him, he never
went without me. It happened, that
he had appointed to go out in this
boat, either for pleasure or for fish,
with two or three Moors of some dis-
tinction in that place, and for whom
he had provided extraordinarily, and
had therefore sent on board the boat,
overnight, a larger store of provision
than ordinary, and had ordered me to
get ready three fusees, with powder and
shot, which were on board his ship, for
tfcaj they designed some sport of fowl-
ing as well as fishing.
.1 got all things ready as he directed,
and waited the next morning with the
Mat washed clean, her ensign and pen-
dants out, arid every Ihing to accom-
modate his'.guests: when, by and by
my patron came on board alone, and
tdldme bis guests had put off going,
upqn some business that fell out, and
ordered me, with the roan and boy,
as usual, to go out with the boat, and
eatjct them some fish, for that his
friends were to sup at his hdti«e; and
commanded, that as soon as I had got
spme fislu I should bring it home to his
house: all which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of
deliverance darted into my thoughts,
for now t found 1 was like to have a
m^
 
but for a voyage, though fknew not.
neither did I so much as eoasX&MY ^hi-
ther I should steer-, for any where to
get out of that place, was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a
pretence to speak to this Moor, to get
something for oiir subsistence on board;
for I told him we must not presume to
eat of our patron's bread: he said, that
was true; so he brought a large bas-
ket of rusk or biscuit, of their kind,
and three jars with fresh water, into tha
boat. I knew where my patron's case
of bottles stood, which it was evident,
by the make, were taken out of some
English prize, and I conveyed them in*
to the boat while the Moor was on
shore, as if they had been there before
for our master. I conveyed also a
great lump of bee's wax into the boat,
which ^weighed above half a hundred
weight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a saw, and a ham-
mer, all of which were of great use to
us aftewards, especially the wax, to
make candles. Another trick I tried
upon him, which he innocently came
into also: his name was Ismael, whom
they call Muley, or Moley; so I called
to him, Moley, said I, our patron's
guns are on board the boat, can you
not get a little powder and shot? it
may "be we may kill some alcamies
(fowls like our curlews) for ourselves,
for I know he keeps the gunner's stores
in the ship. Yes, says he, I will bring
some; and accordingly he brought a
great leather pouch, which held about
a pound and a half of powder, or ra*
ther more, and another with shot, that
had five or six pounds, with some bul-
lets, and put all into the boat: at the
same time J found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which
I filled one of the large bottles in the
case, which was almost empty, pouring
what was m it into another; and thus
furnished with every thing needful, we
sailed out of the port to fish. The
castle, which is at the entrance of the
port, knew who we were, and took no
notice of us; and we were not above a
mile out of the port, before we hauled
m our sail and set us down to fish.
The wind blew from N. N. E. which,
was contrary to my desire; for had it
blown southerly, I had been sure to
have made the roast <jf Spain, and £1
P
last reached the bar of Cadiz: but my
resolutions were, hAow which way it
would, I would be gone from the hor-
rid place where 1 was, and leave the
rest to fate.
After we had fished some time and
catehed nothing*, for when I had fish
on my hook 1 would not pull them up,
that he might not see them, I said to
the Moor, This will not do; our
master will not be thus served; we
must stand farther off. He, thinking
no harm, agreed; and being at the
head of the boat, set the sails; and as
I had the helm, I run the boat near a
league farther, and then brought to, as
if I would fish. Then giving the boy
the helm, I stepped forward to where
the Moor was, and I took him by sur-
prise, with my arm under his waist,
and tossed him clear overboard into the
sea. He rose immediately, for he
swam like a cork, and called to me,
begged to be taken in, and told me he
would go all the world over with me.
He swam so strong after the boat, that
he would have reached me very quickly,
there being but little wind; upon
which I stepped into the cabin, and
fetching one of the fowling pieces, I
presented it at him, and told him, I
had done him no hurt, and if he would
be quiet, I would do him none: but,
said I, you swim well enough to reach
the shore, and 4;he sea is calm; make
the best of your way to shore, and I
will do you no harm: biit if you come
near the boat, I will shoot you through
the head; for I am resolved to have my
liberty. So he turned himself about,
and swam for the shore; and I make
no doubt he reached it with ease, for
he was an excellent swimmer.
I could have been content to have
taken this Moor with me and have
drowned the boy, but there was no
venturing to trust him. When he was
gone, I turned to the boy, whom they
called Xury, and said to him. Xury,
if you will be faithful to me I
will make you a great man; but if
you will not stroke your face to be
true to me, (that is, swear by Maho-
met and his father's beard), I must
throw you into the sea too. The
boy smiled in my fape, and spoke
*,<s itinocgnrty, that I could not mistrust
him; and swore to be faithful to mc^
and go all over the world with nlc.
While I was in view of the Moor
that was swimming, I stood out di-
rectly to sea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they
might think mc gone towards the
Strait's mouth (as indeed any one that
had been iu their wits must liavc becri
supposed to do); for who would have'
supposed we were sailing on to the
southward, to the truly barbarian coast,
where whole nations of Negroes were
sure to surround us with their canoes,
and destroy us; where we could never
once go on shore but we should be
devoured by savage beasts, or more
merciless savages of human kind?
But as soon as it grew dusk in the
evening, I changed my course, and
steered directly "south and by east,
bending my course a little toward the
east, that"! might keep in * with the
shore; and having a fair fresh gale of
wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made
such sail, that I believe by the next
day, at three o'clock in the afternoon,
when I made the land, I could not be
less than 150 miles south of Sallee,
3uite beyond the emperor of Morocco's
ominions, or indeed of any other king
thereabout; for we saw no people.
Yet such was the fright lhad taken
at the Moors, and the dreadful appre-
hensions I had of failing into their
hands, that 1 would not stop, or go on
shore, or come to an anchor, the wind
continuing fair, till I had sailed in that
manner five days; and then the wind
shifting to the southward, I concluded
also that if any of our vessels were in
chase of me, they also would now give
over: so J ventured to make to the
coast, and came to an anchor in the
mouth of a little river; I knew not
what or where, neither what latitude,
what country, what nation, or what
river. I neither saw, nor desired to
see, any people; the principle thing I
wanted was fresh water. We vnrtip
into this creek in the evening, resolving
to swim on shore as soon as it wa$
dark, and discover the country: but**
s&on as it was quite dark, we Tieaftl

H
AD VENTURIS OF
^oor boy was ready to die with fear,
and begged of me not to go on shore
tfll day. Well, Xury, said I, then I
will not; but it may be we may gee
men by dav, who will be as bad to us
as those (ions.—Then we may give
them the shoot-gun, says Xury, laugh-
ing; make them run* away. Such
English Xury spoke by conversing
among us slaves. However, I was glad
to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave
him a dram out of our patron's case of
bottles to cheer him up. After all,
Xury's advice was good, and I took it.
We dropped our little anchor, and lay
still all night: I say, still, for we slept
none; for in two or three hours we
saw vast creatures, (we knew not what
to call them), of many sorts; come
down to the sea-shore, and run into the
water, wallowing and washing them-
selves, for the pleasure of cooling them-
selves; and they made such hideous
bowlings and yellings, that 1 never in-
deed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frightened, and
indeed so was I too^ but we were both
more frightened when we heard one of
these mighty creatures swimming to-
wards our boat: we could not see him,
but we might hear him, by his blowing,
to be a monstrous, huge, and furious
bea3t. Xury said it was a lion, and it
might be so, for aught I know; but
poor Xury cried to rne to weigh the
anchor, and row away. No, says I,
Xury; we can slip our cable with a
buoy to it, and go off to sea: they
cannot follow us tar. I had no sooner
said so, but I perceived the creature
(whatever it was) within two oars
length, which something surprised me;
however, I immediately stept to the
cabin door, and taking up my gun,
fired at him, upon which he imme-
diately turned about, and swam to the
shore again.
But it is impossible to describe the
horrible noises, and hideous cries and
bowlings that were raised, as well upon
the edge of the shore as higher within
the country, upon the noise or report
of the gun; a thing, I believe, those
creatures had never heard before. This
convinced me there was no going on
shore for us in the night upon that
coast: and how to venture on shore in
the day, was another question too; for
to have fallen into the hands of any of
the savages, had been as bad as to have
fallen into the paws of lions and tigers;
at least, we were equally apprehensive
of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged
to go on shore somewhere or other for
water, for we had not a pint left in the
boat: when and where to get it was the
point. Xury said, if I would let him
go on shore with one of the jars, he
would find if there was any water, and
bring some to me. I asked him why
he would go; why I should not go, and
he stay in the boat. The boy answered
with so much affection, that he made
me love him ever after. Says he, if
wild mans come, they eat me, you go
way. Well, Xury, said I, we will both
go; and if the wild mans come, we
will kill them; they shall eat neither
of us. So I gave Xury a piece of
rusk bread to eat, and a dram out of
our patron's case of bottles, which I
mentioned before; and we hauled in
the boat as near the shore as we thought
was proper, and so waded to shore,
carrying nothing but our arms, and
two jars for water.
I did not care to go out of sight of
the boat, fearing the coming of canoes
with savages down the river; but the
boy, seeing a low place about a mile
up the country, rambled to it; and by
and by, I saw him coming running to-
ward me. I thought he was pursued
by some savage, or frightened by some
wild beast, and I therefore ran forwards
to help him; but when I came nearer
to him, I saw something hanging over
his shoulders, which was a creature
that he had shot, like a hare, but dif-
ferent in colour, and longer legs: how-
ever, we were very glad of it and it was
very good meat: but the great joy that
poor Xury came with, was to tell me
he had found good water, and seen no
wild mans.
But we found afterwards, that we
need not take such pains for water;
for a little higher up the creek where
we were, we found the water fresh
when the tide was out, which flowed
but a little way up; so we filled our
jars, and, having a fire, feasted on the
hare we had killed; and prepared to
15
go on our way, having seen no footsteps
of any human creature in that part of
the country.
As I had been one voyage to this
coast before, I knew very well that the
islands of the Canaries, and the Cape
de Verd islands also, lay not far from
the coast. But as I had no instru-
ments to take an observation, to find
what latitude wewere in; and did not
exactly know, or at least remember,
what latitude they were in, I knew not
where to look for them, or when to
stand off to sea towards them, other-
wise I might now have easily found
some of these islands. But my hope
was, that if I stood along this coast till
I came to the part where the English
traded, I should find some of their
vessels upon their usual design of trade,
that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculation, the
place where I now was, must be that
country which, lying between the em-
peror of Morocco's dominions and the
Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited,
except by wild beasts; the Negroes
having abandoned it, and gone farther
south, for fear of the Moors, and the
Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting,
by reason of its barrenness: and, in-
deed, both forsaking it because of the
prodigious numbers of tigers, lions,
leopards, and other furious creatures
which harbour there : so that the Moors
use it for their hunting only, where
they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time: and, indeed,
for near a hundred miles together upon
this coast, we saw nothing but a waste,
uninhabited country by day, and heard
nothing but howlings and roaring of
wild beasts by night.
Once or twice, in the day time, I
thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe,
beiftg the top of the mountain Teneriffe
in the Canaries, and had a great mind
to venture out, in hopes of reaching
thither; but having tried twice, I was
forced in again by contrary winds; the
sea also going too high for my little
vessel; so I resolved to pursue my
first design, and keep along the shore.
Several times I was obliged to land
for fresh water, after we had left this
place; and once in particular, being
early in the morning, wc came to" an
anchor under a little point of Uml
which was pretty high; and the tide
beginning to flow, we lay still to go
farther in. Xury, whose eyes were
more about him than, it seems, mine
were, calls softly to me, and tells me,
that we had best go farther off the
shore; for, says he, look, yonder lies
a dreadful monster, on the side of that
hillock, fast asleep. I looked where
he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster
indeed, for it was a terrible great lion,
that lay on the side of the shore, under
the shade of a piece of the hill that
hung, as it were, over him. Xury, says I,
you shall go on shore and kill him.
Xury looked frightened, and said, Mc
kill J he eat me at one mouth: one
mouthful he meant. However, I said
no more to the boy, but bade him be
still; and I took our biggest gun,
which was almost musquet bore, and
loaded it with a good charge of powder
and with two slugs, and laid it down;
then I loaded another gun with two
bullets, and a third (for we had three
pieces,) I loaded with five smaller bul-
lets. I took the best aim I could with
the first piece, to have shot him in the
head; but he lay so, with his leg raised
a little above his nose, that the slugs
hit his leg about the knee, and broke
the bone: he started up, growling at
first, but finding his leg broke, fell
down again, and then got up upon
three legs, and gave the most hideous
roar that ever I heard. I was a little
surprised that 1 had not hit him on the
head; however, I took up the second
piece immediately, and though he be-
fan to move off, fired again, and shot
im in the head, and had the pleasure
to see rhim drop, and make but little
noise, but lie struggling for life. Then
Xury took heart, and would have me
let him go on shore. Well, go, said I:
so the boy jumped into the water, and
taking a little gun in one hand, swam
to shore with the other hand, and co-
ming close to the creature, put the
muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot
him in the head again, which dispatched
him quite.
This was game, indeed, to us, but it
was no food; and I was very sorry to
lose three charges of powder and shot
upon a creature that wa? good for no-

thing to us. However, Xury said he
would have some of him; so he comes,
on board, and asked me to give him the
hatchet. For what, Xur* I said I, Me
cut off his head, said he. However,
Xury could not cut off his head; but
he cut off a foot, and brought it with
hiw, and it was a monstrous great one.
I bethought myself, however, that per-
haps the skill of him might, one way
or other, be of some value to us; and
I resolved to take off his skin, if I
could. »So Xury and I went to work
with bim: but Xury was much the
better workman at it, for I knew very
ill bow to do it. Indeed, it took us
both up the whole day; but at last we
ffot off the hide of him, and spreading
it on the top of our cabin, the sun ef-
fectually dried it in two days' time, and
it afterwards served me to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the
southward continually, for ten or twelve
days, Hving very sparingly on our pro-
visions, which began to abate very
much, and going no oftener into the
shore than we were obliged to for fresh
water. My design in this, was to make
the river Gambia or Senegal; that is to
say, anywhere about the Cape de Verd,
where I was in hopes to meet with some
European ship; and if I did not, I
knew not what course I had to take,
but to seek for the islands, or perish
among the negroes. I knew that all
the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea, or to
Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this
cape, or those islands: and, in a word,
I put the whole of my fortune upon
this single point, either that 1 must meet
with some ship, or must perish.
When I had pursued this resolution
about ten days longer, as I have said,
I began to see that the land was inha-
bited; and in two or three places, as
we sailed by, we saw people stand upon
the shore to look at us: we could also
perceive they were quite black, and strnk
naked. I was once inclined to have
gone on shore to them; but Xury was
my better counsel lor, and said to me, No
go, no go. However, I hauled in
nearer the shore, that I might talk to
them; and I found they ran along the
shore by me a good way. I observed
they had no wen pons in their hands,
except one, who had a long, slender
stick, which Xury said was a lance, and
that they would throw them a great
way with good aim; so 1 kept at a
distance, but talked to them by signs,
as well as I could, and particularly
made signs for something to eat. They
beckoned to ine to stop my hoat, and
they would fetch me some meat: upon
this, I lowered the top of my sail, and
lay by, and two of tiiem ran up into
the country; and in less than half an
hour came back, and brought with
thetn two pieces of dry flesh and some
com, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what
the one or the other was; however we
were willing to accept it. But how
to come at it was our next dispute, for
I was not for venturing on shore to
to them, and they were as much afraid
of us: but they took a safe way for us
all, for they brought it to the shore,
and laid it clown, and went and stood
a great way off till we fetched it on
board, ana then came close to us
again.
We made signs of thanks to them,
for we had nothing to make them
amends: but an opportunity offered
that very instant to oblige them won*
derfully; for while we were lying by
the shore* came too mighty creatures,
one pursuing the other (as we took it)
with great fury, from the mountains
towards the sea; whether it was the
male pursuing the female, or whether
they were in sport or in rage, we could
not tell, any more than we could tell
whether it was usual or strange; but
I believe it was the latter, because, in
the first place, those rarenous creatures
seldom appear but in the night; and,
in the second place, we found the
people terribly frightened, especially
the women. The man that had the
lance, or dart, did not fly from them,
but the rest did; however, as the two
creatures ran directly into the water,
they did not seem to offer to fall upon
any of the negroes, but plunged them-
selves into the sea, and swam about
as u they had come for their di-
version; at last, one of them began
to come nearer our beat than I at first
expected: but I lay readv for him, for
I had loaded my gun with ail possible
17
ettieditictt, and bad Xitry load both the
others. As soon as he came fairly
withiii my reach, I fired, aftd shot him
directlv 'in the head: immediately he
stfnk down into the water, biit rose in-
staiitlv, and plunged Up and riotftt,
as if he was straggling for life, arid
so indeed he was: he immediately
made to the shore j but between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and
the strangling of the water, he died
just before he reached the shore.
ft is impossible to express the as-
tonishment of these poor creatures, at
the noise and nre of my gun; some of
them were even ready to die for fear,
and fell down as dead with the very
terror j but when they saw the creature
dead, and sunk in the water, and that
I made signs to them to come to the
shore, they took heart and came to the
shore, and began to search for the
creature. I found him by his blood
staining the water; and by the help of
a rope, which I slung round him, and
gave the Negroes to haul*; they dragged
him on shore, and found that it was a
most curious leopard, spotted, and fine
to an admirable degree j and the Ne-
groes held up their hands with admi-
ration, to tnmk what it was I had
killed him with.
The other creature, frightened with
the flash of fire and the noise of the
gun, swam on shore, and ran up di-
rectly to the mountains from whence
they "came$ nor could I, at that distance,
know what it was. I found quickly the
Negroes were for eating the flesli of
this creature, so I was willing to have
them take it as a favour from me:
which, when I made signs to them that
they might take him, they were very
thankful for. Immediately they fell
to work with him; and though they
had no knife, yet, with a sharpened
piece of wood, they took off his skin'
as readily, and much more readily,
than we could have done with a knife.
They offered me some of the flesh,
Wjiich I declined, making a* if f would
give it them, but made signs for the
skin, which they gave me very freely,
and brought me a great deal more of
their provisions, which, though I did
not understand, yet I accepted. I then
niade signs to them for some water,
and held out one of my jars to them,
turning it bdttom upward, to show
that it was empty, aijd that I Wanted
to have it filled. Thfejr called im-
mediately to sotite of their friends, ahd
there came two woolen, «ntl brought ft ,'
great vessel made of etfrtW j and burnt,
as i suppose, in the stm; this they set
down to me, as before, arid I setttf
Xury on shore with my jats, md filled
them all three. The women wcr> as{
stark naked as the men*.
I was now furnished With roots and'
corn, such as it was, and water; ant!"
leaving my friendly Negroes, I made
forward for about eleven days rriore,
without offering to go near the shore*
till I saw the land run out a great
length into the sea, at about the distance
of four or live leagues before me; and
the sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing, to make this point. At length,
doubling the point, at about two leagues
from the land, I saw plainly land on
the other side, to seaward: then I con-
cluded, as it Was most certain indeed,
that this was the Cape de Verd, and
those the islands, called, from thence,
Cape de Verd Islands. However,they
were at a great distance, and I could
not well tell what I had best to db;
for if I should be taken with a gale of
wind, I might neither reach one nor'
the other.
In this dilemma, as 1 was very pen- *
sive, I stepped into the cabin, ana sat
me down, Xury hating the helm:' when,
on a sudden, the boy cned mtt, Master,
master, a ship with a sail j and <ffi6;
foolish boy was frightened outr of his'
wits, thinking it must needs be some'
of his master's ships sent to pursue us,
when I khtfw we were gotten rar chough
out -of their reach. I jumped out of
the cabin, md immediately saw, not
only the ship, but what she was, viz.'
that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as
I. thought, was bound to the coast of
Giiinea for Negroes. But, When I ob-
served tli6 course slit* steered, I was
scon convinced they were hound'some
other way, and did not design to come
any nearer to the share: upon which,
I stretched out to sea as much as I *
cOUld, resolving to speak with them, If
possible.
With all the sail I could make, I
C 2
le
ADVENTURES OF
found I should not be able to come in
their way, but that they would be gone
by before I could make any signal to
them: but after I had crowded to the
utmost, and began to despair, they, it
seems, saw me, by the help of their
perspective glasses, and that it was
some European boat, which, they sup-
posed, must belong to some ship that
was lost; so they shortened sail, to let
me come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my patron's ensign
on board, J made a waft of it to them,
for a signal of distress, and fired a gun,
both which they saw; for they told me
they saw the smoke, though they did
not hear the gun. Upon these signals,
they very kindly brought to, and lay
by for me; and in about three hours
time I came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Por-
tuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,
but I understood none of them; but,
at last, a Scotch sailor, who was on
board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an English-
man, that I had made my escape out
of slavery from the Moors, at Sallee:
they then bade me come on board, and
very kindly took me in, and all my
goods*
It was an inexpressible joy to me,
which any one will believe, that I was
thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from
such a miserable, and almost hopeless
condition as I was in; and I imme-
diately oiFered all I had to the captain
of the ship, as a return for my de-
liverence *, out he generously told me,
he would take nothing from, me, but
that all I had should be delivered safe
to me, when I came to the Brazils.
For, says he, I have saved your life on
no other terms than I would be glad to
be saved myself; and it may, one time
or other, be my lot to be taken up in
the same condition. Besides, said he,
when I carry you to the Brazils, so
great a way from your own country, if
I should take from you what you have,
you will be starved there, and then I
only take away that life I have given.
No, n% Seignor Inglese (Mr. English-
man)! says he; I will carry you thitlicr
in charity, and these things will help to
buy your subsistence there, and your
passage home again,
As he was charitable in this pro-
posal, so he was just in the performance,
to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen,
that none should offer to touch any
thing I had: then he took every thing
into his own possession, and gave me
back an exact inventory of them, that
I might have them, even so much as
my three earthem jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good
one; and that he saw, and told me he
would buy it of me for the ship's use;
and asked me what I would have for
it? I told him, he had been so generous
to me in every thing, that I could not
offer to make any price of the boat,
but left it entirely to him: upon which,
he told me he would give me a note of
hand to pay me eighty pieces of eight
for it at Brazil; and when it came
there, if any one offered to give more,
he would make it up. He offered me also
sixty pieces of eight more for my boy,
Xury, which I was loth to take; not
that I was not willing to let the captain
have him, but I was very loth to sell
the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted
me so faithfully in procuring my own.
However, when I let him know my
reason, he owned it to be just, and of-
fered me this medium, that he would
give the boy an obligation to set him
free in ten years, if he turned Christian:
upon this, and Xury saying he was
willing to go to him, I let the captain
havehim.
We had a very good voyage to the
Brazils, and arrived in the B% de To-
dos los Santos, or All Saints' Bay, in
about twenty-two days after. Andnow
I was once more delivered from the
most miserable of all conditions of life;
and what to do next with myself, I was
now to consider.
The generous treatment the captain
gave me, I can never enough remem-
ber: he would take nothing of me for
my passage, gave me twenty ducats for
the leopard's skin, and forty for the
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and
caused every thing I had in the ship
to be punctually delivered to me; and
what I was willing to sell he bought of
me; such as the case of bottles, two of
my guns, and a piece of the lump of
bees-wax,—for I had made candles of
the rest; in a word, I made about two
I#
hundred and twenty pieces of eight of
all my cargo; and with this stock, I
went on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here, before I
was recommended to the house of a
good honest man, like himself, who
had an ingeino as they call it, (that is, a
plantation and a sugar house.) I lived
with him some time, and acquainted
myself, by that means, with the man-
ner of planting and making of sugar:
and seeing how well the planters lived,
and how they got rich suddenly, I
resolved, if I could get a licence to set-
tle there, I would turn planter among
them: endeavouring, in the mean
time, to find out some way to get my
money, which I had left in London,
remitted to me. To this purpose,
getting a kind of a letter of naturalis-
ation, I purchased as much land that
was uncured as my money would
reach, and formed a plan for my plan-
tation and settlement; such a one as
might be suitable to the stock which
I proposed to myself to receive from
England.
f had a neighbour, a Portuguese of
Lisbon; but born of English parent,
whose name was We I la, and in much
such circumstance as I was. I call
him my neighbour, because his plan-
tation lay next to mine, and we went
on very sociably together. My stock
was but low, as well as his; and we
rather planted for food than any thing
else, for about two years. However,
we began to increase, and our land
began to come into order; so that the
third year we planted some tobacco,
and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes in the
year to come: but we both wanted
help; and now I found, more than be-
fore/! had done wrong in parting with
my boy Xury.
But, alas! for me to do wrong, that
never did right, was no great wonder.
I had no remedy, but to go on: I had
got into an employment quite remote
to my genius, and directly contrary to
the life I delighted in, and for whteh I
forsook my father's house, and broke
through all his good advice: nay, I was
coming into the very middle station, or
upper degree of low life, which my
father advised me trt before; and
which, if I resolved to go on with, I
might as well have staid* at home, and
never have fatigued myself in thfl
world, as I had done: ana I used often
to say to myself, I could have done this
as well in England, among mv friends,
as have gone live thousand miles off to
do it among strangers and savages, in
a wilderness, and at such a distance m
never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of
me.
In this manner, I used to look upon
my condition with the utmost regret.
I had nobody to converse with, but now
and then this neighbour; no work to
be done, but by the labour of my
hands: and I used to say, I lived just
like a man cast away upon some deso-
late island, that had nobody there but
himself. But how just has it been!
and how should all men reflect, that
when they compare their present con-
ditions with others that are worse,
Heaven may oblige them to make the
exchange, and be convinced of their
former felicity by their experience: I
say, how just has it been, that the truly
solitary life I reflected on, in an island
of mere desolation, should be my lot,
who had <?<> often unjustly compared
it with the life which I then led, in
which, had I continued, I had, in all
probability, been exceeding prosperous
and rich.
I was, in some degree, settled in my
measures for carrying on the planta-
tion, before my kind friend, the captain
of the ship that took me up at sea, went
back; for the ship remained there, in
providing his lading, and preparing for
his voyage, near three months; when",
telling him what little stock I had left
behind me in London, he gave me this
friendly and sincere advice: Seignior
Inglese, says he, (for so he always
called me), if you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me,
with orders to the person who has your
money in London, to send yonr effects
to Lisbon, to such persons as I shall
direct, and in such goods as are proper
for this country, I will bring you the
produce of them, God willing^ at ftiy
return: but since human affairs are all
subject to changes and disasters, I
•would have vou give order* for but one
c 2

iWViNTURES OF
hundred pounds sterling, which, you
gay, is half your stock, and let the
hazard he run for the first, so that if
it come safe, you may order the rest
the same way; and, if it miscarry, you
may have the other hajf to have recourse
to rpr your supply.
This was so wholesome advice, and
looked so friendly, that I could not but
he convinced it was the best course I
could take; so I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom
1 left my money, and a procuration to
the Portuguese captain, as he desired
me.
I wrote the English captain's widow
a full account of all my adventures;
my slavery, escape, and how 1 had met
with the Portuguese captain at sea, the
humanity of his behaviour, and what
conditiou I was now in, with all other
necessary directions for my supply;
and when this honest captain came to
Lisbon, he found means, by some of
the English merchants there, to send
over, not the order only, but a full ac-
count of my story to a merchant at
Loudon, who represented it effectually
to her; whereupon she not only de-
livered the money, but, out of her own
pocket, sent the Portuguese captain a
very handsome present for his humanity
ana charity to me,
The- merchant in London, vesting
this hundred pounds in English goods,
simh as the captain had wrote for, sent
them directly to him at Lisbon, and he-
brought them all safe to me at the Bra-
zils: among which, without my direc-
tion (for I was too young in my busi-
ness to think of them), he had taken
care to have all sorts of tools, iron-
work, and utensils, necessary for my
plantation, and which were of great use
tojroe.
When this cargo arrived, I thought
my fortune made, for I was surprised
with the joy of it j and my good stew-
ard, the captain, had laid out the five
pounds, which my friend had sent him
asauresent for himself, to purchase
an4;W*»g me over a servant, under
bond for six year*' service, and would
no* accept of any consideration, except
a^ J|tti# tobacco, which I would have
hjm acoept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods
being all English manufactures, such
as cloths, stuffs, baize, and things par-
ticularly valuable and desirable in the
country, I found means to sell them to
a very great advantage; so that I might
say, I had more than four times the va-
lue of my first cargo, and was now in-
finitely beyond iny poor neighbour, I
mean in the advancement of my plan-
tation: for the first thing I tRd, I bought
me a Negro slave, and an European
servant also; I mean another besides
that which the captain brought me
from Lisbon.
But as abused prosperity is often-
times made the very means of our ad-
versity, so was;it with me. I went on
the next year with great success in my
plantation; I raised fifty great rolls of
tobacco on my own ground, more than
I had disposed of for necessaries among
my neighbours; and these fifty rolls,
being each of above* 1001b, weight,
were well cured, and laid by against
the return of the fleet from Lisbon:
and now, increasing in business and in
wealth, my head began to be full of
projects and undertakings beyond my
reach; such as are, indeed, often the
ruin of the best heads in business.
Had I continued in the station I was
now in, I had room for all the happy
things to have yet befallen me, for
which my father so earnestly recom-
mended a quiet, retired life, atid which
he had so sensibly described the middle
station of life to be full of: but other
things attended me, and I was still to
be the wilful agent of all my own mi-
series; and, particularly* to increase
my fault, and double the reflections
upon myself, which in my future sor-
rows I should have leisure to make, all
these miscarriages were procured by
my apparent obstinate adhering to my
foolish inclination, of wandering abou4
and pursuing that inclination, in, coik
traduction to the clearest views of doing
myself good in a fair and plain pursuit
of those prospects, and those measures
of life, which nature and providence
concurred to present me with, and to
make my duty.
As I had ouce done thus iu breaking,
away from my parents, so 1 could not
be content now, but I must go and
leave the happy view I had of being a
rich and thriving man in my new plan*
tation, only to pursue a rash and im-
21
moderate debit*, of rising faster than
the nature of the thing admitted; and
thus I east myself down again into the
deepest gulf of human "misery that
ever man fell into, or perhaps could be
consistent with life, and a state of
health in the world.
To come, then* by just degrees, to
the particulars of this part of my story:
—You may suppose, that having now
lived almost four years in the Brazils,
and beginning to thrive and prosper
very well upon my plantation, I had
not only learned the language, but had
contracted an acquaintance and friend-
ship among my fellow planters, as well
as among the merchants at St. Salvador,
which was our port; and that, in my
discourses among them, I had fre-
quently given them an account of my
two voyages to the coast of Guinea,
the manner of trading with the Ne-
groes there, and how easy it was to
purchase on the coast for trifles—such
as beads, toys, knives, scissars, hat-
chets, bits of glass, and the like—not
only gold dust, Guinea grains, ele-
phant's teeth, &c. but Negroes for the
service of the Brazils, in great num-
bers.
They listened always very attentive-
ly to my discourses on these heads, but
especially to that pare of it which re-
lated to'the buying Negroes; which
was a trade, at that time, not only not
far entered into, but, as far as it was,
had been carried on by the assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain
and Portugal, and engrossed from the
public; so that few Negroes were
bought, and those excessive dear.
It happened, being in company with
some merchants and planters of my ac-
quaintance, and talking of those things
very earnestly, three of them came to
me the next morning, and told me
they had been musing Very much upon
wh>t I had discoursed with them of the
last night, and they came to make a
secret proposal tome: and after en-
joining me to secrecy, they told me
that they had a mind to fit Out a ship
to go to Guinea; that they had all
plantations as well as I, and were strait-
ened for nothing so much as servants;
that it was a trade that could not be
carried on, because they could not pub-
licly sell the Negroes when they catoe
home, so they desired to make but onto
voyage, to brfrig the Negroes on shore
privately, and divide them among their
own plantations: and* in a word, the
question was, whether I would go their
supercargo in the ship, to manage the
trading part upon the coast of Guinea j
and they offered me that I should have
an equal share of the Negroes, without
providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be
confessed, had it been made to any one
that had not a settlement and plan-
tation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very
considerable, and with a good stock
upon it. But for me, that was thus
entered and established, and had no-
thing to do but go on as I had begun,
for three or four years more, and to
have sent for the other hundred pounds
from England; and who, in that time>
and with that little addition, could
scarce have failed of being worth three
or four thousand pounds sterling, and
that increasing too; for me to think of
such a voyage, was the most prepos-
terous thing that ever matt, in such cir-
cumstances, could be guilty of.
But I, tlmt was bom to be my own
destroyer, could no more resist the ofc.
fer, than I could restrain my first ram-
bling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word,
I told them I would go with all my
heart, if they would undertake to look
after my plantation in my absence, and
would dispose of it to such' as I should
direct, if I miscarried. This they all
engaged to do, and entered into writing!
or covenants to do so: and I made a
formal will, disposing of my plantation
and effects, in Ae of my death; making*
the captain of the ship that had saved
my life, as before, my universal heir;
but obliging him to dispose of my effects
as I had directed in my will; one half
of the produce being to himself, and
the other to be shipped to England.
Ih short, I took all possible caution
to preserve my effects, and to keep uj>
my plantation: had Fused half as much
prudence to have locked into my own
interest, and have made a judgment'of
what I ought to have done and not to
have done, I had certainly never gtme
c3
away from so prosperous an underta-
king, leaving all the probable views of
& thriving circumstance, and gone a
voyage to sea, attended with all its
common hazards, to say nothing of the
reasons I had to expect particular mis-
fortunes to myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed
blindly the dictates of my fancy rather
than my reason: and accordingly, the
ship being fitted out, and the cargo fur-
nished, and all things done as by agree-
ment, by my partners in the voyage, I
went on board in an evil hour again,
the 1st of September, 1659, being the
same day eight years that I went from
my father and mother at Hull, in order
to act the rebel to their authority, and
the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about one hundred and
twenty tons burden, carried six guns,
and fourteen men, besides the master,
his boy, and myself; we had on board
no large cargo of goods, except of such
toys as were fit for. our trade with the
Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass,
shells, aind odd trifles, especially little
looking glasses, knives, scissars, hat-
.ehets,and the like.
The same day I went on board we
set sail, standing away to the north-
ward upon our own coast, with design
to stretch over for the African coast.
When they came about ten or twelve
degrees of northern latitude, which, it
seems, was the manner of their course
in those days, we had very good wea-
ther, only excessive hot ail the way
upon our own coast, till we came to
the height of Cape St. Augustino;
from whence, keeping farther off at
sea, wo lost sight of land, and steered
as if we were bound for the isle Fer*
nando de Noronha, holding our course
N.E. by N. and leaving those isles on
the east. In this course we passed the
line in about twelve day's time, and
were by our last observation, in 7 de-
grees 22 minutes northern latitude,
when a violent tornado, or hurricane,
took us quite out of our knowledge:
it began from the south-east, came
about to the north-west, and then set-
tled in the north-east; from whence it
blew in such a terrible manner, that for
Iwelva days together we could do nor
thing bin drive, and scudding away be^
fore it, let it carry us whither ever late
ami the fury of the winds directed; and,
during these twelve days, I need not
say that I expected everyday to be swal-
lowed up; nor, indeed, did any in the
ship expect to save their live3«
In this distress, we had, besides the
terror of the storm, one of our men
died of the calenture, and one man and
a boy washed overboard. About the
twelfth day, the weather abating a little,
the master made an observation as well
as he could, and fouad that he was in
about 11 degrees north latitude, but
that he was 22 degrees of longitude
difference, west from cape St. Augus-
tino j so that he found he was got upon
the coast of Guiana, or the north part
of Brazil, beyond the river Amazons,
toward that of the river Oroonoque,
commonly called the Great River; and
began to consult with me what course
he should take, for the ship was leaky
and very much disabled, and he was
going directly back to the coast of
Brazil.
I was positively against that; and
looking over the cLarts of the sea-coast
of America with him, we concluded
there was no inhabited country for us
to have recourse to, till we came within
the circle of the Caribbee islands, and
therefore resolved to stand away for
Barbadoes; which by keeping off to
sea, to avoid the indraft of the hay or
gulf of Mexico, we might easily pel*
form, as we hoped, in about fifteen
day's sail j whereas we could not pos-
sibly make our voyage to the coast
of Africa without some assistance, both
to our ship and ourselves.
With this design, we changed our
course, and steered away N. W. by W.
in order to reach some of our English
islands where I hoped for re lief but our
voyage was otherwise determined; for
being in the latitude of 12 degrees 18
minutes, a second storm came upon
us, which carried us away with the
same impetuosity Westward, and drove
us so out ofUhe very way of all human
commerce, that had all our lives been
saved, as to the sea, we were rather in
danger of being devoured by savages
than ever returning to our own coun-
try.
In this distress, the wind still blow.
23
mg very hard, one of our men, early In
the morning, cried out, Land! and we
had no sooner run out of the cabin to
look out, in hopes of seeing where-
abouts in the world we were, but the
ship struck upon a sand, and in a mo-
ment her motion being so stopped, the
sea broke over her in such a manner,
that we expected we should all have
perished immediately; and we were
immediately driven into our close
quarters, to shelter us from the very
foam and spray of the sea.
It is not easy for any one who has
not been in the like condition, to de-
scribe or conceive the consternation of
men in such circumstances: we knew
nothing where we were, or upon what
land it was we were driven, whether
an island or the % main, whether in-
habited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of the wind was still great, though
rather less than at first, we could not
so much as hope to have the ship hold
many minutes, without breaking in
pieces, unless the wind, by a kind of
miracle,should immediately turn about.
In a word, we sat looking upon one
another, and expecting death every
moment, and every man acting accord-
ingly, as preparing for another world;
for there was little or nothing more for
us to do in this: that which was our
present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was, that, contrary to our ex-
pectation) the ship did not break yet,
and that the master said the wind be-
gan to abate.
Now, though we thought that the
wind did a little abate, yet the ship
having thus struck upon the sand, and
sticking too fast for us to expect her
getting off, we were in a dreadful con-
dition indeed, and had nothing to do,
but to think of saving our lives as well
as we could. We had a boat at our
stern just before the storm, but she
was first staved by dashing against the
ship's rudder, and, in the next place,
she broke away, and either sunk, or
was driven off to sea; so there was no
hope from her: we had another boat
on board, but how to get her off into
to the sea was a doubtful thing; how-
ever, there was no room to debate,
for we fancied the ship would break in
pieces every minute, and some told us
she was actually broken already.
In this distress, the mate of our
vessel laid hold of the boat, and with
the help of the rest of the men, they
got her flung over the ship's side; and
getting all into hef, let her go, and
committed ourselves, being eleven in
number, to God's mercy, and the wild
sea: for though the storm was abated
considerably, yet the sea wont dreadful
high upon the shore, and might be
well called den wild zee, as the Dutch
call the sea in a storm.
And now our case was very dismal
indeed; for, we all saw plainly, that
the sea went so high, that the boat
could not live, and that we should he
inevitably drowned. As to making sail,
we had none; nor, if we had could we
have done any thing with it; so we
worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men
going to execution; for we all knew
that when the boat came nearer to the
shore, she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. How-
ever, we committed our souls to God
in the most earnest manner; and the
wind driving us towards the shore, we
hastened our destruction with our own
hands, pulling as well as we could to-
wards land.
What the shore was—whether rock
or sand, whether steep or shoal—we
knew not: the only hope that could
rationally give us the leas^t shadow of
expectation, was, if we might happen to
get into some bay or gulf, or the mouth
of some river, where by great chance
we might have run our boat in, or got
under the lee of the land, and perhaps
made smooth water. But there was
nothing of this appeared; and as we
made nearer and nearer the shore, the
land looked more frightful than the
sea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven,
about a league and ahalf,as we reckoned
it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came
rolling astern of us, and plainly bade
us expect the coup de grace. In a
word, it took us with such a fury,
that it overset the boat at once; and
separating us, as well from the boat as
from one another, gave us not time
c 4
.^ybnturbs m
hmllf to say, "O God!" for we were
all 8 wallowed up in a moment.
Nothing can describe the confusion
of thought which I felt, when I sunk
into the water 5 for though I swam
verv well, yet I could not deliver my-
self from the waves so as to draw my
breath, till that wave having driven me,
or rather carried me, a vast way on
towards the shore, and having spent
itself, went back, and left me upon
the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. 1 had so much
presence of mind, as well as breath
left, that seeing myself nearer the main
land than I expected, I got upon my
feet, «nd endeavoured to make on to-
wards the land as fast as I could, be-
fore another wave should return and
take me up again j but I soon found it
was impossible to avoid it -y for I saw
the sea come after me as high as a
great hill, and as furious a3 an enemy,
which I had no means or strength to
contend with: my business was to hold
my breath, and raise myself upon the
water, if I could; and so, by swimming,
to preserve my breathing, and pilot
myself towards" the shore, if possible;
my greatest, concern now being, that
fche wave, as it would carry me a great
way towards the. shore when it came
on, might not carry me back again
with it when it gave back towards the
sea.
The wave that came upon me again,
buried me at once twenty or thirty feet
deep in its own body; and I could feci
myself carried with a mighty force
and swiftness towards the shore, a
very great way; but I held my breath,
ana assisted myself to swim still for-
ward with all my might. I was ready
to burst with holding my breath, when,
as* I felt myself rising up, so, to my
immediate relief, I found my head and
hands shoot out above the surface of
the water; and though it was not two
seconds of time that I could keep my*
Self so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave
me bTe,ath, and new courage. I was
covered again with water a good while,
but not so long hut I held it out -, and
finding the water had spent itself, and
began, to return, I struck forward
%ajnst the return of, the waves, and
felt ground again with my feet I
stood still a few moments, to recover
breath, and till the water went from
me, and then took to my heels, and
ran with what strength I had farther
towards the shore. But neither would
this deliver me from the fury of the
sea, which came pouring in after me
again j and twice more I was lifted up
by the waves and carried forwards as
before, the shore being very flat.
The last time of these two had well
nigh been fatal to me; for the sea
having hurried me along, as before,
landed rnc, or rather dashed me, against
a piece of a rock, and that with such
force, that it left me senseless, and in-
deed helpless, as to my own deliverance;
for the blow taking my side and breast,
beat the breath, as it were, quite out
of my^ body j and iad it returned
again immediately, X must have beeij
strangled in the water: but I recovered
a little before the return of the waves,
and seeing I should again be covered
with the water, I resolved to hold fast
by a piece of the rock, and so to hold
my breath, if possible, till the wave
went back. Now as the waves were
not so high as the first, being nearer
land, I held my hold till the Wave
abated, and then fetched another rim,
which brought me so near the shore,
that the next wave, though it went over
me, yet did not so swallow me up as
to carry me away; and the next run I
took, I got to the main land; where, to
my great comfort, I clambered up the
cliffs, of the shore, and sat me down
upon the grass, free from danger, and
quite out of the reach of the water.
I was now landed, and safe on shore;
and began to look up and thank God
that my fife was 3dved,in a case wherein
there were, some minutes before, scarce
any room to hope. I believe it is im-
possible to express, to the life, what
the ecstacies and transports of the soul
are, when it i3 so saved, as I may say,
out of the grave: and I did not wonder
now at the custom, viz. that when a
malefactor, who has the halter about
his neck, is tied up, and just going to
be turned off, and has a, reprieve
brought to him; I say I do not wonder
that they bring a surgeon with it, to
25
let him blood that very moment they tell
Ihui of, that the surprise may not drive
the animal spirits from the heart, and
overwhelm him •
For sudden joys, like griefs, confound
at first*
I walked about on the shore, lifting
up roy hands, and my whole being, as
I may say, wrapt up in the contempla-
tion of my deliverance; making a thou-
sand gestures and motions, which I
cannot describe; reflecting upon my
comrades that were drowned, and that
there should not be one soul saved but
myself; for, as for them, I never saw
them afterwards, or any sign of them,
except three of their bats, one cap, and
two shoes, that were not fellows.
I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel
*~-when the breach and froth of the
sea being so big I could hardly see it,
it lay so*far off—and considered, Lord!
how was it possible I ,eould get on
shore?
After I had solaced my mind with
the comfortable part of my condition,
I began to look round me, to see what
kind of a place I was in, and what was
next to be done; and I sooft found my
comforts abate, ami that, in a word* I
had a dreadful deliverance : for I was
wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor
any tiling either to eat or drink, to
comfort me; neither did I see. any
prospect before me, but that of perish-
ing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts: and that which was par*
ticularly afflicting to me was, that I
had no weapon, either to hunt and kill
any creature for my sustenance, or to
defend myself against any other crea*.
ture that might desire to kill me for
theirs. In a word, I had nothing about
me but a k»ife, a.tobaoeo pipe, and a
little tobacco in. a box. This was all
my. provision; and this threw me into
such terrible agonies of mind, that
for awhile I ran about like a madman.
Night coming upon me, I began
with a heavy heart, to consider what
would be my, lot, if there were any
ravenous beasts in that country, seeing
at night they always come abroad for
their prey^
All the remedy that offered to my
thoughts at that time, was, to get up
into a thick bushy tree, like a fir, but
thorny—which grew near me,and #here
I resolved to sit all night—and consider
the next day what-death I should die,
for as yet I saw no prospect of life.
I walked about a furlong from the
shore, to see if I could find any fresh
water to drink, which I did, to my
great joy; and having drank, and put
a little tobacco iuto my mouth to pre-
vent hunger, I went to the tree, tad
getting up into it, endeavouredlto place
myself so, as that if I should full
asleep, I might not fall; and having
cut me a short stick, like a truncheon,
for my defence, I took up my lodging;
and having been excessively fatigued,
I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfort-
ably as, I believe, few could hav*
done in my condition; and found my-
self the most refreshed with it that I
think I ever was on such an occasion.
When I waked it was broad day, the
weather clear, and the storm abated,
so that the sea did not rage and swell
as before; but that which surprised
me most was, that the ship wae lifted
off in the night from the sand were
she lay* by the swelling of the tide,
and was driven up almost as far as
the rock which I at first mentioned^
where L had been so bruised by the
wave dashing me against it» This
being within about a mile from the
shore where I was, and the ship* seen*-
ing to stand upright still, I wished mjs-
ng
eft
self, on board, that at least I might save
some necessary things for my use*
When I came down from my apart-
ment in the tree* I looked about rae
again, and the first thing I round was
the boat, which lay as the wind and
the sea had tossed her up* upoirthe
land, about two miles on my right
hand. I walked as far as I could upon
the shore, to have got to her; 'but
found a neck, or inlet, of water be-
tween me and the boat, which was
about half a mile broad1; so I came
back for the present, being more in-
tent upon getting at the ship, wJiere I
hoped to find something for my* pre-
sent subsistence.
A little after noon I found the tea
very calm, and the tide ebbed so far
oat, that I.could cjomeavitbin a quarter
of a mile from the ishrp: and' hece> I
found a fresh renewing of my grief:
ABVENT0ERS OF
for I" saw evidently, that if we had
kept on board, we nad been all safe;
that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable
as to be left entirely destitute of all
comfort and company a3 I now was.
This forced tears from my eyes again;
but as there was little relief in that, I
resolved, if possible, to get to the ship;
sol pulled off my clothes, for the
weather was hot to extremity, and
took the water: but when I came to
the ship, my difficulty was still greater
to know how to get on board; for as
she lay aground, and high out of
water, there was nothing within my
reach to lay hold of. I swam round
her twice, and the second time I spied
a small piece of a rope, which I won-
dered J did not see at first, hang down
by the fore chains so low, as that with
great difficulty I got hold of it, and by
the help of that rope got into the fore-
castle of the ship. Here I found that
the ship was bulged, and had a great
deal of water in her hold; but that
she lay so on the side of a bank of hard
sand or rather earth, that her stern lay
lifted up upon the bank, and her head
low, almost to the water. By this
means all her quarter was free, and
all that was in that part was dry;
for you may be sure my first work
was to search and to see what was
spoiled and what was free: and,
first, I found that all the ship's pro-
visions were dry and untouched by
the water; and being very well dispos-
ed to eat, I went to the bread room,
and filled my pockets with biscuit, and
eat it as I went about other things, for
I had no time to lose; I also found
some rum in the great cabin, of which
I took a large dram, and which I had
indeed need enough of, to spirit me
-for what was before me. Now I want-
ed nothing but a boat, to furnish my-
self with many things which I foresaw
would be very necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish
for jwhat was not to be had, and this
extremity roused my application: we
had several spare yards, and two or
three large spars of wood, and a snare
top-mast or two in the ship, I resolved
to fall to work with these, and flung
'as many overboard as I could manage
for their weight, tying every one with
a rope, that they might not drive away.
When this was done, I went down the
ship's side, and pulling them to me, I
tied four of them fast together, at both
ends as well as I could, in the form of
a raft, and laying two or three short
pieces of plank upon them, cross ways,
I found I could walk upon it very well,
but that it was not able to bear any
great weight, the pieces being too light:
so I went to work, and with the car-
penter's saw I cut a spare top-mast
into three lengths, and added them to
my raft, with a great deal of labour
and pains. But the hope of furnishing
myself with necessaries, encouraged
me to go beyond what I should have
been able to have done upon another
occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to
bear any reasonable weight. My next
care was what to load it with, and
how to preserve what I laid upon it
from the surf of the sea; but I wa3
not long considering this. I first laid
all the planks or boards upon it that
I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, I got three
of the seamen's chests, which I
had broken open and emptied, and
lowered them down upon my raft;
these I filled with provisions, viz.
bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five
pieces of dried goats' flesh (which we
lived much upon), and a little re-
mainder of European corn,1 which had
been laid by for some fowls which we
had brought to sea with ii3, but the
fowls were killed. There had been
some barley and wheat together, but
to my great disappointment, I found
afterwards that the rats had eaten, or
spoiled it all. As for liquors I found
several cases of bottles belonging to
our skipper, in which were some
cordial waters; and, in all, about five
or six gallons of rack. These I stow-
ed by themselves, there being no need
to put them into the chests, nor any
room for them. While I was doing
this, I found the tide began to,, flow,
though very calm -, and I had the" mor-
tification to see my coat, shirt, and
waistcoat, which T had left on shore,
upon the sand, swim away; as for my
breeches, which were only linen, and
open-kneed, I swam on board in them
and my stockings. However, this put
V
me upon rummaging for clothes, of
which I found enough, hut took no
more than I wanted for present use,
for I had other things which my eye
was more upon; as, first, tools to w6rk
with on shore: and it was after long
searching that I found the carpenter's
chest, which was indeed a very useful
prize to me, and much more valuable
than a ship-lading of gold would have
been at that time. I got it down to
my raft, even whole as it was, without
losing time to look into it, for I knew
hi general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammuni-
tion and arms. There were two very
good fowling pieces in the great cabin,
and two pistols; these I secured first,
with some powder-horns and a small
bag of shot, and two old rusty swords.
I knew there were three barrels of
powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gunner had stowed them;
but with much search I found them,
two of them dry and good, the third
had taken water. Those two I got to
my raft, with the arms. And now I
thought myself pretty well freighted,
and began to think how I should get
to shore with them, having neither
sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least
cap-full of wind would have overset
all my navigation.
I had three encouragements: 1st, A
smooth, calm sea: 2dly. The tide
rising, and setting in to the shore:
3diy, What little wind there was, blew
me towards the land. And thus, having
found two or three broken oars belong-
ing to the boa^ and besides the tools
which were in the chest, I found two
saws, an axe, and a hammer; and with
this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or
thereabouts, my raft went very well,
only that I found it drive a little distant
from the place where I had landed be-
fore; by which I perceived that there
was some indraft of the water, and
consequently I hoped to find some
creek or river there, which I might
make use of as a port to get to land
with my cargo.
As I imagined, so it was: there ap-
peared before me a little opening of
the land, and I found a strong current
of the tide set into it; so I guided my
raft, as well as I could, to get into the
middle of the stream. Bui here 1 had
like to have suffered a second ship-
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily
would have broken my heart; for
knowing nothing of the coast, my raft
ran aground at one end of it upon a
shoal, and not being aground at the
other end, it wanted hut a little that
all my cargo had slipped off towards
that end that was afloat, and so fallen
into the water. I did my utmost, by
setting my back against the chests, to
keep them in their places, but could not
thrust off the raft with all mystrength;
neither durst I stir from the posture I
was in, but holding up the chests with
all my might, I stood in that manner
near half an hour, in which time the
rising of the water brought me a little
more upon a level; and a little after,
the water still rising, my raft floated
again, and I thrust her off with the oar
I had into the channel, and then driv-
ing up higher, I at length found my-
self in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both sides, and a strong cur-
rent or tide running up, 1 looked on
both sides for a proper place to get to
shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high up the river, hoping, in time,
to see some ship at sea; and therefore
resolved to place myself as near the
coast as I could.
At length I spied a little cove on the
right shore of the creek, to which, with
great pain and difficulty >I guided my raft
and at last got so near, as that reaching
ground with my oar. I could thrust
her directly in; but here I had like to
have dipped all my cargo into the sea
again; for that shore lying pretty steep,
that is to say, sloping, there was no
place to land, but where one end of
my float, if it ran on shore, would lie
so high, and the other sink lower, as
before, that it would endanger my cargo
again. All that I could do, was to
wait till the tide was at the highest,
keeping the raft with my oar like an
anchor, to hold the side of it fast to
the shore, near a fiat piece of ground,
which I expected the water would flow
over; and so it did. As soon as I found
water enough, for my raft drew about
a foot of water, I thrust her upon that
fiat'piece of ground, and there fastened
or moored her, by sticking my two
2g
ADVENTURES OP
broken oars Uito the ground one on
one side, near one end, and one on the
otjier Bide, near the other end: and
thus I lay till the water ebbed away,
and left my raft and all my cargo*safe
on shore.
My next work was to view the coun-
try, and seek a proper place for my
habitation, and where to stow my
goods, to secure them from whatever
might happen. Where I was, I yet
knew not; whether on the continent,
or an an island; whether inhabited, or
not inhabited; whether in danger of
wild beasts, or not. There was a hill
not above a mile from me, which rose
up very steep and high, and which
seemed to overtop some other hills,
which lay as in a ridge from it, north-
ward. I took out one of the fowling-
pieces, and one of the pistols, and a
horn of powder; and thus armed, I
travelled for discovery up to the top of
that hill; where, after I had with great
labour and difficulty, got up to the top,
I saw my fate, to my great affliction,
viz. that I was in an island, environed
every way with the sea, no land to be
seen, except some rocks, which lay a
prent way off, and two small islands,
less than this which lay about three
leagues to the west.
t found also that the island I was
in was barren, and as I saw good reason
to believe, uninhabited, except by wild
beasts, of whom, however I saw none;
yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew
not their kinds; neither, when I killed
them, could I tell what was fit for food,
and what not. At my coming back, I
shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting
uppn a tree, on the side of a great
wood. I believe it was the first gun
that liad been fired there since the
creation of the world: I had no sooner
fired, but from all the parts of the
wood there arose an innumerable
number of fowls, of many sorts,
making a confused screaming, and
crying, every one according to his
usual note; but not one of them of
any kind that I knew. As for the
creature I killed, I took it to be a kind
of hawk, its colour and beak resem-
bling U, but had no talons or claws
more dian common. Its flesh was
carrion^ and fit for nothing.
Contented with this disco very, I
came back to my raft, and fell to work
to bring my cargo on shore, which
took me up the rest of that day: what
to do with myself at night I knew not,
nor indeed where to rest: for I was
afraid to lie down on the ground, not
knowing but some wild beast might
devour me; though, as 1 afterwards
found, there was really no need for
those fears.
However, as well as I could, I bar-
ricadoed myself round with the chests
and boards that I had brought oh
shore, and made a kind of a hut for
that night's lodging. As for food, I
yet saw not which way to supply my^*
self, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, run out of
the wood where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I
might yet get a great many things out
of the ship, which would be useful to
me, and particularly some of the rig-
ging and sails, and such other things
as might come to land; and I resolved
to make another voyage on board the
vessel, if possible. And as I knew
that the first storm that blew must
necessarily break her all in pieces, I
resolved to set all other things apart,
till I got every thing out of the ship
that I could get. Then I called a
council, that is to say, in my thoughts,
whether I should take back the raft;
but this appeared impracticable: so I
resolved to go as before, when the tide
was down; and I did so, only that I
stripped before I went from my hut;
having nothing on but a chequered
shirt, a pair of linen drawers, and a
pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the ship as before,
and prepared a second raft, and having
had experience of the first, I neither
made this so unwieldly, nor loaded it
so hard, but yet I brought away several
things very useful to me: as, first, in
the carpenter^ stores, I found two or
three bags of nails and spikes, a greafc
screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets;
and, above all that most useful riling
called a grind-stone. All these I se-
cured together with several things be-
longing to the gunner; particularly,
two or three iron crows, and 'two
barrels of musket bullets, seven mus-
23
kets, and another fowling-piece, with
some small quantity of powder more;
a large bag-full of small-shot, and a
great roll of sheet lead; but this last
was so heavy, I could not hoist it up to
get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things I took all the
men's clothes that I could find, and a
spare fore-top sail, a hammock, and
some bedding; and with this I loaded
my second raft, and brought them all
safe on shore, to my very great com-
fort.
I was under some apprehensions,
during my absence from the land, that
at least my provisions might be de-
voured on shore: but when I came
back, I found no sign of any visitor j
only there sat a creature like a wild
cat, upon one of the chests, which,
wlfcen I came towards it, ran away a
little distance, and then stood still.
She sat very composed and unconcern-
ed, and looked full in my face, as if
she had a mind to be acquainted with
me. I presented my gun to her, but
a3 she did not understand it, she was
perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did
she offer to stir away; upon which I
tossed her a bit of biscuit, though, by
the way, I was not very free of it, for
my store was not great: however, I
spared her a bit, J say, aad she went to
it, smelled of it, and ate it, and looked
(as pleased) for more; but I thanked
hers and could spare no more: so she
marched off.
Having got my second cargo on
shore*—though I was fain to open the
barrels of powder, and bring them by
parcels, for they were too heavy, being
large casks—I went to work to make
me a little tent, with the sail, and some
.poles, which I cut for that purpose;
and into this tent I brought every
thing that I knew would spoil either
with rain or sun; and I piled all the
empty chests and casks up in a circle
round the tent to fortify it from any
sudden attempt either from man or
beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up
the door of the tent with some boards
within* and an empty ehest set up on
end without; and spreading one of the
beds upon the ground, laying my two
pistols just at my head, and iny gun at
length by me, I went to bed for the
first time and slept very quietly all
night, for I was very weary and heavy;
for the night before I had slept little,
and had laboured very hard all day, as
well to fetch all those things from the
ship, as to get them On shore.
J had the biggest magazine of all
kinds now that ever was laid up, I be-
lieve, for one man: but I was not satis-
fied still: for while the ship sat up-
right in that posture, J thought I
ought to get every thing out of her
that I could: so every day, at low
water, I went on board, and brought
away something or other r but parti-
larly, the third time I went, I brought
away as much of the rigging as I
could, as also all the small ropes and
rope-twine I could get, with a piece
of spare canvas, which was to mend
the sails upon occasion, and the barrel
of wet gun-powder. In a word, I
brought away all the sails first and
last; only that I was fain to cut them
in pieces, and bring as much at a time
a3 I could; for they were no more
useful to be sails, but as mere canvas
only.
But that which comforted me still
more was, that, last of all, after Ihad
made five or six such voyages as these,
and thought I had nothing more to ex-
pect from the ship that was worth my
meddling with; I say, after all this, I
found a great hogshead of bread, and
three large runlets of rum or spirits,
and a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine
flour; this was surprising to me, be-
cause I had given over expecting any
more provisions, except what was
spoiled by the water. I soon emptied
the hogshead of that bread, and wrapped
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the
sails, which I cut out; and, in a word,
I got all this safe on shore also.
The next day I made another voy-
age, and now having plundered the
ship of what was portable and fit to
hand out, I began with the cables, and
cutting the great cable into pieces, such
as I could move, I got two cables and
a hawser on shore, with all the iron
work I could get; and having cut down
the spriteail-yard, and the nViKen-yard,
and every thing I could, to male a
large raft, I loaded it with all those
30
ADVENTURES OF
heavy goods,' ami came away; but my
good luck began now to leave me, for
this raft was so unwieldy, and so over-
laden, that after I was entered the
little cove, where I had landed the rest
of my gooda, not being able to guide
it so handily as I did the other, it over-
set, and threw me and all my cargo
into the water; as for myself, it was
no great harm, for I was near the
shore; but as to my cargo, it was a
great part of it lost, especially the iron,
which I expected would have been of
great use to me: however, when the
tide was out, * I got most of the pieces
of cable ashore, and some of the iron,
though with infinite labour; for I was
fain to dip for it into the water, a work
which fatigued me very much. After
this I went every day on board, and
brought away what I could get.
I had been now thirteen days ashore,
and had been eleven times onboard the
ship; in which time I had brought
away all that one pair of hands could
well be supposed capable to bring;
though I believe verily, had the calm
weather held, I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece j
but preparing, the twelfth time, to go
on board, I found the wind began to
rise: however, at low water, I went
oa board; and though I thought I had
rummaged the cabin so effectually, as
that nothing could be found, yet 1 dis-
covered a locker with drawers in it, in
one of which I found two or three ra-
zors, and one pa&r ;<0f large scispars,
with some ten' &?*.-* defcen of good
knives and forks; in another I found
about thirty-six pounds value in mo-
ney, some European coin, some Brazil,
some pieces of eight, some gold, and
some silver.
I smiled to myself at the sight of
this money: O drug! said I aloud,
what art thou good for? Thou art
not worth to me, no, not the taking off
the ground; one of thtse knives is
worth all this heap: I have no manner
of use for thee; e'en remain where thou
art, and go to the bottom, as a crea-
ture whose life is not worth saving.
However* upon second thoughts, I
took it away; and wrapping all this in
apiece of canvass, I began to think of
mskftig another raft; but while I was
preparing this, I found the sky over-
cast, and the wind began to rise, and
in a quarter of an hour it bleW a fresh
gale from the shore. It presently oc-
curred to me, that it was in vain to
pretend to make a raft with the wind
off shore; and that it was my business
to be gone before the tide or flood be-
gan, or otherwise I might not be able
to reach the shore at all. Accordingly
I let myself down into the water, and
swam across the channel* which lay
between the ship and the sands, and
even that with difficulty enough, partly
with the weight of the things I had about
me, and partly the roughness of the
water; for the wind rose very hastily,
and before it was quite high water it
blew a storm.
But I was got home to my little tent,
where I lay, with all my wealth about
me very secure. It blew -very hard all
that night, and in the morning, when
I looked out, behold no more ship was
to be seen! I was a little surprised,
but recovered myself with this satis-
factory reflection, viz. that I had lost
no time, nor abated no diligence, to
get every thing out of her that could
be useful to me, and that, indeed, there
was little left in her that I was able to
bring away, if I had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts
of the ship, or of any thing out of her,
except what might drive on shore, from
her wreck; as, indeed, divers pieces of
her afterwards did; but those things
were of small use to me.
My thoughts were now wholly em-
ployed about securing myself against
either savages, if any should appear,
or wild beasts, if any were in the island;
and I had many thoughts of the method
how to do this, and what kind of
dwelling to make, whether I should
make me a cave in the earth, or a tent
upon the earth: and in short, I re-
solved upon both; the manner and des-
cription of which, it may not be im-
proper to give an account of.
I soon found the place I was in was
not for my settlement, particularly be-
cause it was upon a low, moorish
ground, near the sea, and I believed
it would not be wholesome; and more
particularly because there was no
fresh water near it: so I resolved to
31
find a more healthy ami more conve-
nient spot of ground.
I consulted several things in my si-
tuation, which I found would be pro-
per for me: 1st. Health and fresh wa-
ter, I just now mentioned: 2dly, Shel-
ter from the heat of the sun: 3d, Se-
curity from ravenous creatures, whe-
ther men or beasts: 4thly, A view to
the sea, that if God sent any ship in
sight, 1 might not lose any advantage
for my deliverance, of which I was not
willing to banish all my expectation
yet.
In search for a place proper for this,
I found a little plain on the side of a
rising hill, whose front towards this
little plain was steep as a house-side,
so that nothing could come down upon
me from the top. On the side of this
rock there was a hollow place, worn
a little way in, like the entrance or
door of a cave; but there was not
really any cave, or way into the rock,
at all.
On the flat of the green, just before
this hollow place, I resolved to pitch
my tent. This plain was not above a
hundred yards broad, and about twice
as long, and lay like a green before my
door; and, at the end of it, descended
irregularly every way down into the
low ground by the sea side. It was
on the N. N. W. side of the hill; so
that it was sheltered from the heat every
day, till it came to a W.and by S. sun,
or thereabouts, which in those coun-
tries, is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a
half-circle before the hollow place,
which took in about ten yards in its
semi-diameter from the rock, and
twenty yards in its diameter, from its
beginning and ending.
In this half circle I pitched two rows
of strong stakes, driving them into the
ground till they stood very firm like
piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five feet and a half and
sharpened on the top. The two rows
did not stand above six inches from
one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable
which I cut in the ship, and laid them
in rows, one upon another, within the
circle, between these two rows of
stakes, up to the top, placing other
stakes in the inside, leaning against
them, about two feet and a half high,
like a spur to a post; and this fence
was so strong, that neither man uor*
beast could get into it or over it. This
cost me a great deal of time and
labour, especially to cut the piles
in the woods, bring them to the place,
and drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made
to be not by a door, but by a short
ladder to go over the top; which lad-
der, when I was in, I lifted over after me $
aud so I was completely fenced in and
fortified, as I thought, from all the
world, and consequently slept secure in
the night, which otherwise I could not
have done; though, as it appeared
afterwards, there was no need of all
this caution from the enemies that I
apprehended danger from.
Into this fence*, or fortress, with in-
finite labour, I carried all my riches, ail
my provisions, ammunition, and stores,
of which you have the account above;
and I made a large tent, which, to
preserve me from the rains, that in one
part of the year are very violent there,
I made double, viz. one smaller tent,
within, and one larger tent above it,
and covered the uppermost with a
large tarpaulin, which I had saved
among the sails.
And now I lay no more for a while
in the bed which I had brought on
shore, but in a hammock; which was
indeed a very good one, and belonged
to the mate of the ship.
Into this tent I brought all my pro-
visions, and every thing that would spoil
by the wet $ and having thus enclosed
all my goods, I made up the entrance
which till now I had left open, and so
passed and repassed, as I said, by a
short ladder.
When I had done this, I began to
work my way into the rock, and bring-
ing all the earth and stones that I dug
down out through my tent, I laid them
up within my fence in the nature of a
terrace, so that it raised the ground
within about a foot and a half; and
thus I made me a cave, just behind my
tent, which served me like a cellar
to my house. It cost me much labour
and many days, before all these things
were brought to perfection $, ami there-
32
AD VENTURIS OF
f6t6 f itmst? go back to «oroe other
things which took up some of my
thoughts. At the same time it hap-
pened, after I had laid my scheme for
4fee aettinr tip ray tent, and making
ike caire, taat a storm of rain falling
from a thick, dark cloud, a sudden
flask of lightning happened, and after
that, a gTeat dap or thunder, as is
naturally the effect of it. I was not so
much surprised with the lightning, as
I was with a thought* which darted
4nto my iniwd as swift as the lightning
itself: O my powder I My very heart
sunk within me when I thought, that
atone Wast, all my powder might be
destroyed; on which, hot my defenee
only, but the providing me food, as I
thought, entirely depended. I was
nothing near so anxious about my own
danger, though, had the powder took
€rc, I had never known who had hurt
me.
Such impression did this make upon
me, that after the storm Was over, I
laid aside all my works, my building
and fortifying, and applied myself to
make bags and boxes, to separate the
powder, and to keep it a little and a
little in a parcel, in hope that what-
ever might come, it might not all take
fire st once; and to keep it so apart
that it should not be possible to make
one part fire another. 1 finished this
work in about a fortnight; and I think
my powder, which in all was about
24&ib. weight, was divided in not less
than a hundred parcels. As to the
barrel that had been wet, I did not ap-
prehend any danger from that; so I
placed it m my new cave, which, in my
feacv, I called my kitchen, and the
rest I hid up and down in holes among
thet rocksj so that no wet might come
to it, marking very carefully where I
laid H.
Inj the interval of time while this was
doing, I went out at least once every*
day with my gun; as well to divert
myself, as to see if I could kill any
thing fit for food; and> as near as I
coui& to acquaint myself with what
the island produced. The first time I
went oat, I presently discovered thtit
Uteris <were goats upon the island, which
was a gmt satisfaction to me; but
then it*-was attended with this mis*
fortune to me, viz. that they were so
shy, so subtle and so «wift of foot,
that it was the most difficult thing in
the wot Id to come at them: but I was
not discouraged at this, not doubting
but I might now and then shoot one,
as it soon happened; for after 1 had
found their haunts a little, I laid watt
in this manner for them; I observed,
if they saw me in the valleys, though
they were upon the rocks, they would
run away as in a terrible fright; but ff
they were feeding in the valleys, «ad
I was upon the rocks, they took no
notice of me; from whence I con-
cluded, that by the position of their
optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not readily
see objects that were above them:
so afterwards, I took this method*—!
always climbed the rocks first, to get
above them, and then had frequently a
fair mark. The first shot I made
among these creatures, I killed a she-
goat, which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved
me heartily; but when the old one
fell, the kid stood stock still by her,
till I came and took her up; and not
only so, but when I carried the old
one with me, upon my shoulders, the
kid followed me quite to my enclosure;
upon which, I laid down the dam, and
tbok the kid in my arms, and carried
if over my pale, in hopes to have bred
it up tame; but it would not eat;
so I was forced to kill it, and eat it
myself. These two supplied me with
flesh ft great while, for 1 ate sparingly,
and preserved my provision (my bread
especially) as mufch as possibly I
could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I
found it absolutely necessary to pro-
vide a place to make a fire in, and fuel
to burn; and what I did for that, as s
ateo how T enlarged my cave, and
what conveniences $ made, I shall give
a full account of it in it*> proper place:
but I must first give some little account
of myself, and of my thoughts about
living, which, it may well be supposed
were not a few.
I had a dismal prospect of my condi-
tion; for as I was not cast away upon
that island without being driven, as is
said, by a violent storm quite out of
33
the coarse of oar intended voyage:
and a great way, vk. some hundreds
of leagues, out of the ordinary course
of the trade of mankind, I kail great
reason to consider it as a determina-
tion of heaven, that in this desolate
place, and in this desolate manner, I
should end my life. The tears would
run plentifully down my face when I
made these reflections j and sometimes
I would expostulate with myself why
Providence should thus completely
fain its creatures, and render them so
absolutely miserable; so abandoned
without help, so entirely depressed,
that it could hardly be rational to be
thankfully for such"a life.
But something always returned swift
upon me to cheek these thoughts, and
to reprove me: and particularly, one
day,'walking with my gun in my
handj by the sea side, I was very pen-
sive upon the subject of my present
condition, when reason, as it were,
expostulated with me the other way,
thus: Well, you are in a desolate con-
dition, it is true; but, pray remember,
where are the rest of you? Did not
you come eleven of you into the boat?
Where are the ten? AVhy were not
they saved, and you lost? Why were
you singled out? Is it better to be
here or "there? And then I pointed to
the sea. All evils are to be considered
with the good that is in them, and
with what worse attends them
Then it occurred to me again, how
well I was furnished for my subsist-
ence, and what would have been my
case if it had not happened (which was
a hundred thousand to one) that the
ship floated from the place where she
first struck, and was driven.so near
to the shore, that I had time to get all
the*e things out of her: what would
have been my case, if I had been to
have lived in the condition in which I
at first came on shore, without neces-
% saries of life, or necessaries to supply
and procure them? Particularly, said
I aloud (though to myself), what
should I have done without a gun,
without ammunition, without any
tools to make any thing, or to wort
"with,without clothes, bedding, a tent,
or any manner of covering? and that
now I had all these to a sufficient
quantity, and was in a fair way to pro-
vide mvseif in such a manner as to
live without my gun when my ammu-
nition was spent: so that I had a to-
lerable view of subsisting, without any
want, as long as I lived j for I consi-
dered, from the beginning, howl would
provide for the accidents that might
happen, and for the time that was ..to
come, not only after my ammunition
should be spent, but even after my
health or strength should decay.
I confess 1 had not entertained any no*
tion of my ammunition being destroy-
ed at one blast, I mean my powder being
blown up by lightning; and this made
the thoughts of it so surprising to me,
when it lightened and thundered, as I
observed just now.
And now being to enter into a me-
lancholy relation of a scene of silent
life, such, perhaps, as was never heard
of in the world before, I shall take it
from its beginning, and continue it in
its order. It was, by my account, the
.30th of September, when, in the man-
ner as above said, I first set foot upon
this horrid island -f when the sun being
to us in its autumnal equinox, was al-
most just over my head: for I reckon-
ed myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes north
of the line.
After I had been there about ten or
twelve days, it came into my thought*
that I should lose my reckoning of
time for want of books, and pen aud
ink, and should even forget the sabbath
days from the working days: but, to
prevent this, I cut it with my: knife
upon a large post, in capital letters y
and making it into a great cross, I set
it up on the shore were I first landed,
viz. "I came on shore here on the
30th of September, J 659." Upon the
sides of this square post I cut every day
a notch with, my knife, and every
seventh notch was as long again as the
rest, and every first day of the month
as long again as that long one: and
thus I kept my calendar, or weekly,
monthly, and yearly reckoning of
time.
But it happened, that among the
many things which I brought out of
the ship, in the several voyages which,
as above mentioned, I made to it, I
D ;j
34
ADVENTURES OF
«#ot several things of less value, but
not at all less useful to me, which I
found, some time after, in rummaging
the chests; as, in particular, pens,ink,
and paper; several parcels in the
captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpen-
ter's keeping; three or four compas-
ses, some mathematical instruments,
dials, perspectives, charts, and books
of navigation; all which I huddled
together, whether I might want them
or no: also I found three very good
bibles, which came to me in my cargo
from England, and which I had packed
up among my things; some Portu-
guese books also, and, among them,
two or three popish prayer books, and
several other books, all which 1 care-
fully secured. And 1 must not forget,
that we had in the ship a dog, and two
cats, of whose eminent history I may
have occasion to say something in its
place; for I carried both the cats with
me; and as for the dog, he jumped
out of the ship himself, and swam on
shore to me the day after I went on
shore with my first cargo, and was a
trusty servant to me for many years:
I wanted nothing that he could fetch
me, nor any company that he could
make up to me, I only wanted to have
him talk to me, but that would not
do. As I observed before, I found
pens, ink, and paper, and I husbanded
them to the utmost; and I shall show
that while my ink lasted, I kept things
very exact, "but after that was gone I
could not; for I could not make any
ink, by any means that I could de-
vise.
And this put me in mind that I
wanted many things, notwithstanding
all that I had amassed together; and
tof these, this of ink was one; as also
a spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig
or remove the earth; needles, pins,
and thread; as for linen, I soon learn-
ed to want that without much diffi-
culty.
This want of tools made every work
I did go on heavily; and it was near a
whole year before 1 had entirely finish-
ed my little pale, or surrounded my
habitation. The piles or stakes, which
If ere as heavy as I could well lift, were
a long time in cutting and preparing
Hi'the* woods, and more, by far, in
bringing home ; so that I spent some-
times two'days in cutting and bringing
home one of those posts, and a tuird
day in driving it into the ground; for
which purpose, I got a heavy piece of
wood at first, but at last bethought
myself of one of the iron crows; which,
however, though I found it, yet it
made driving these posts or piles very
laborious and tedious work. But
what need I have been concerned at the
tediousness of any thing I had to do,
seeing I had time enough to do it in?
nor had I any other employment, if
that had been over, at least that I could
foresee, except the ranging the island
to seek for food; which I did, more or
less, every day.
I now began to consider seriously
my condition, and the circumstance I
was reduced to; and I drew up the state
of my affairs in writing, not so much
to leave thein to any that were to come
after me (for I was like to have but
few heirs), as to deliver my thoughts
from daily poring upon them, ana af-
flicting my mind: and as my reason be-
gan now to master my despondency, I
began to comfort myself as well as
I could, and to set the good against
the evil, that I might have something
to distinguish my case from worse;
and I stated very impartially, like
debtor and creditor, the comforts I
enjoyed against the miseries I suffered,
thus :—
Evil.
I am cast upon a horrible, desolate
island, void of all hope of recovery.
Good.
But I am alive; and not drowned,
as ail my ship's company were.
Evil
I am singled out and separated as it
were, from all the world, to be miser-
able.
Good.
But I am singled out too from all
the ship's crew, to be spared from death;
and he that miraculously saved me
from death, can deliver me from this
condition.
Evil.
I am divided from mankind, a soli-
taire; one banished from human so-
ciety.
as
Good.
But I am not staged, and perishing
in a barren place, affording no suste-
nance.
Evil.
I have no clothes to cover me.
Good,
But I am in a hot climate, where if
I had clothes, I could hardly wear
them.
Evil.
I am without any defence, or means
to resist any violence of man or beast.
Good.
But I am cast on an island where I
see no wild beast to hurt me, as I saw
on the coast of Africa; and what if I
had been shipwrecked there?
EvU.
I have no soul to speak to, or relieve
me.
Good.
But God wonderfully sent the ship
in near enough to the shore, that I
have got out so many necessary things
as will either supply my wants, or enable
me to supply myself, even a3 long as I
live.
Upon the whole, here was an un-
doubted testimony that there was scarce
any condition in the world so miserable,
but there was something negative, or
something positive, to be thankful for
in it; and let this stand as a direction,
from the experience of the most mi-
serable of ail coaditiens in this world,
that we may always find in it something
to comfort ourselves from, and to set,
in the description of good and evil, on
the credit side of the account.
Having now brought my mind a
little to relish my condition, and given
over looking out to sea, to see if I
could spy a ship; I say, giving over
these things, I began to apply myself
to accommodate my way of living, and
to make things as easy to me as I
•could.
I have already described my habita-
tion, which was a tent under the side
of a roek, surrounded with a strong
pale of posts and cables; but I might
now rather call it a wall, for I raised a
kind of wall against it of turfs, about
two foot thick'on the outside: and af'
ter some time (I think it was a year and
a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning
to the rock, and thatched or covered it
with boughs of trees,* and such things
as I could get, to keep out the rain;
which I found, at some times of the year,
very violent.
I have already observed how I brought
all my goods into this pale, and into
the cave which I had made behind me.
But I must observe, too, that at first
this was a confused heap of goods,
which, as they lay in no order, so they
took up ail my place: I had no room
to turn myself: so I set myself to en-
large my cave, and work farther into
the eartli; for it was a loose, sandy
rock, which yielded easily to the labour
I bestowed on it: and when I found I
was pretty safe as to the beasts of prey,
I worked sideways, to the right hand,
into the rock, and then turning to the
right again, worked quite out, and made
me a door to come out in the outside
of my pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and
regress, as it were, a back-way to my
tent and to my storehouse, but gave
me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to
make such necessary thing's as I found I
most wanted, particularly a chair and
a table; for without these I was not
able to enjoy the few comforts I had in
the world; I could not write, or eat, or
do several things with so much plea-
sure, without a table: so I went to
work. And here 1 must needs observe,
that as reason is the substance and ori-
ginal of the mathematics, so by stating
and squaring every thing by reason,
and by making the most rational
judgment of things, every man inay
be,~in time, master of every mechanic
art. I had never handled a tool in
my life; and yet, in time, by labour,
application, and contrivance, I found,
at last, that I wanted nothing but I
could have made, especially if 1 had
had tools. However, I made abun-
dance of things, even without tools;
and some with no more tools than an
adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that
with infinite labour. , For exw»pte,fif
I wanted a board, I had no other way
but to cut down a tree, set it guar edge
before me, and hew it fiat on either
side with my axe, till I had brought it
3(>
ADVENTURES OF
to be as thija as a plank, and then dub
it smooth with my adze. It is true,
by, this method I could make but one
board of a whole tree; but this I had
had no remedy for but patience, any
more, than I had for a prodigious deal
of time and labour which it took me
up to make a plank or board: but
my time or labour wa9 little worth, and
so it was as well employed one way a3
another.
However, I made me a table and a
chair as I observed above, in the first
place; and this I did out of the short
pieces of boards that I brought on my
raft from the ship. But when I wrought
out some boards as above, I made large
shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a
half, one over another, all along one
side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron work on; and in a word,
to separate every thing at large in their
places, that I might easily come at
them. I knocked pieces into the wall
ot the rock, to hang my guns, and all
things that would hang up: so that
had my cave been seen, it looked like
a general magazine of all necessary
things -, and I had every thing so ready
at my hand, that it was a great plea-
sure to me to see all my goods in such
order, and especially to find my stock
of all necessaries so great.
And now it was that I began to keep
a Journal of every day's employment;
for, indeed, at first, I was in too much
hurry, and not only hurry as to labour,
but jn much discomposure of mind;
anil .my journal would, too, have been
full of, many dull things: for example,
I, mmt have said ihus-^-" Sept. 3Qt/i.
After I had got to shore, and had es-
caped drowning, instead of being
tliankful to God for my deliverance,
haying first vomited, with the great
quantity of salt water which was got-
ten; into my stomach, and recovering
m]$e]f a little, I ran about the shore,
wringing my hands,and beating my head
and face, exclaiming at my misery,
and .crying, out, I was undone, undone!
till, tired and faint, I was forced to lie
dpwn on the ground to repose; but
4iWs;t.ttqt sleep, for fear of being de-
voured.'*
t!5iqme days after this, and after I had
been on board, the ship, and got all that
I could out of her, I could not forbear
getting up to the top of a little moun-
tain, and looking out to sea, in hopes
of seeing a ship: then fancy that, at a
vast distance, 1 spied a sail, please my-
self with the hopes of it, and, after
looking steadily, till I was almost blind,
lose it quite, and sit down and weep
like a child, and thus increase my mi-
sery by my folly.
But having gotten over these things
in some measure, and having settled
my household-stuff and habitation,
made me a table and a chair, and all as
handsome about me as 1 could, I began
to keep my journal: of which I shall
here give you the copy (though in it
will be told all these particulars over
again) as long as it lasted; for, having
no more ink, I was forced to leave it
off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30th, 1659. I, poor mi-
serable Robinson Crusoe, being ship-
wrecked, during a dreadful storm, in
the offing, came on shore on this dis-
mal up fortunate island, which I called
the Island of Despair; all the rest
of the ship's company being drowned,
and myself almost dead.
All the rest of that day I spent in
afilicting myself at the dismal circum-
stances I was brought to, viz. I had
neither food, house, clothes, weapon,
nor place to fly to: and, in despair of
any relief, saw nothing but deatlr be-
fore me; that I should either be de-
voured by wild beasts, murdered by sa-
vages, or starved to death for want of
food. At the approach of night I
slept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures;
but slept soundly, though it rained all
night.
October 1.—In the morning I saw,
to my great surprise, the ship had
floated with the high tide, and was
driven on shore again much nearer the
island; whkh, as it was some comfort
on one hand (for seeing her sit upright,
and not broken in pieces, I hoped, if
the wind abated, I might get on board,
and get some food and necessaries out
of her for my relief,) so, on the other
hand, it renewed my grief at the loss
of my comrades, who, I imagined, if
we had all staid on board, might have
37
saved the ship, or at least that they
would not have been ail drowned, as
they were: and that had the men been
saved we might perhaps have built us a
boat, out of the ruins of the ship, to have
carried us to some other part of the
world. I spent great part of this day
in perplexing myself on these things 5
but at length seeing the ship almost
dry, I went upon the sand as near as
I could and then swam ori board. This
day also it continued raining, though
with, no wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th.
All these days entirely spent in many
several voyages to get all I could out
of the ship 3 which 1 brought on shore,
every tide of flood, upon rafts. Much
rain also in these clays, though with
some intervals of fair weather: but
it seems this was the rainy season.
Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all
the goods I had got upon it; but being
in shoal water, and the things being
chiefly heavy, I recovered many of
them when the tide was out.
Oct. 25. It rained all night and all
day, with some gusts of wind; during
which time the ship broke in pieces
(the wind blowing a little harder than
before) and was no more to be seen,
except the wreck of her, and that only
at lojy water. I spent this day in
covering and securing the goods which
I had saved, that the rain might not
spoil them.
Oct. 26\ I walked about the shore
almost all day, to find out a place to
fix my habitation; greatly concerned
to secure myself from any attack in
the night, either from wild beasts or
men. Towards night I fixed upon a pro-
per place, under a rock, and marked
out a semicircle for my encampment;
which I resolved to strengthen with a
work, wall, or fortification, made of
double piles, lined, within with cables,
and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 30th, I work-
ed very hard in carrying all my goods
to my new habitation, though some
part of the time it rained exceedingly
hard.
The 31st, in the morning, I went
out into the island with my gun, to
see for some food, and discover the
country; when 1 killed a she-goat, and
her kid followed me home, which I
afterwards killed also, because it
would not feed.
November 1. I set up rrty tent
under a rock, and lay there for tjie
first night! making it as large as I
could, with stakes driven in to swing
my hammock upon.
Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and
boards, and the pieces of timber which
made my rafts; and with them formed
a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortifi-
cation.
Nov, 3. I went out with my gun,
and killed two fowls like ducks, which
were very good food. In the after-
noon I went to work to make me a
table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to
order my times of work, of going out
with my gun, time of sleep, and time
of diversion; viz. every morning I
walked out with my gun for two or
three hours, if it did not rain; then
employed myself to work till about
eleven o'clock; then ate what I had
to live on; and from twelve to two I
lay down to sleep, the weather being
excessive hot; and then in the even-
ing, to work again. The working
part of this day and the next was
wholly employed in making my table,
for I was yet but a very sorry work-
man: though time and necessity made
me a complete natural mechanic soon
after, as I believe they would any one
else.
Nov. 5. This day went abroad with
my gun and dog, and killed a wild* cat;
her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good
for nothing: of every creature that I
killed I took oflf the skins, and pre-
served them. Coming back by the
sea shore, I saw many sorts or sea-
fowl which I did not understand: but
was surprised and almost frightened,
with two or three seals; which white
I was gazing at them, (not well know-
ing what they were) got into the s'eja,'
and escaped me for that time.
Nov. 6. After my morning wafK,
I went to work with my table again,
and finished it, though not to my
liking: nor was it long before 1 learft-
ed to mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled

aWoad, except in the evening, for food;
tjiis , time I spent m putting ail my
things in order withio doors.
\ 'January. 1... Very hot,still,;, but i
went. abroad earty and late , with m y
fun, and lay still in the middle of the
ay. This evening, going farther into
the valley3 which lay "towards the
centre of the island, 1 found there was
plenty of goats, though exceeding shy,
and turd to eoine at j however, I re-
solved to try if 1 could not bring my
dog to hunt them down. Accordingly,
the' next day, I went out with my dog,
and set him upon the goats; but i was
mistaken, for they ail faced about upon
the dog; and lie knew his danger too
well, for he would not come near them.

ki the .woods for game every day* when*
the rain permitted me, and made fre*'
qucnt discoveries, in these walks* of
something or other to my advantage}
partieularly» I found a"'kind of wild
pigeons, who build, not m wood-pi*
geons, in a tree, but rather as house-
pigeons,;in the holes of the rocks: and
taking some young* ones, 1 endeavour*
ed to breed them up tame, and did so 5
but when they grew older, they flew all
away; which,, perhaps, was at first for
want of feeding them, for 1 had no-
thing1 to give tliein; however, 1 fre-
quently found their nests, and got their
young ones, which were very, good
meat. And now, in the managing my
household affairs, I found myself want-

powder in when I divided it for fear of
the lightning, or some such use), I shook
the husks of corn out of it, on one side
of my fortification, under the rock.
It was a little before the great rain
just now mentioned, that I threw this
stuff avi ay; taking no notice of any thing,
and not so much as remembering that
I had thrown any thing there; when
about a month after, I saw some few
stalks of something green, shooting
out of the ground, which I fancied
might be some plant I had not seen:
but I was surprised, and perfectly as-
tonished, when, after a little longer
time, I saw about ten or twelve ears
come out, which were perfect green
barley of the same kind as our Euro-
pean, nay, as our English barley.
It is impossible to express the asto-
nishment and confusion of my thoughts
on this occasion: I had hitherto act-
ed upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed, 1 had very few notions of re-
ligion in my head, nor had entertained
any sense of any thing that had befal-
len me, otherwise than as chance, or,
as we lightly say, what pleases God;
without so much as inquiring into the
end of Providence in these things, or
his order in governing events in the
world. But after I saw barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was
not proper for corn, and especially as
I knew not how it came there, it start*-
led me strangely; and I began to sug-
gest, that God had miraculously caused
this grain to grow without any help of
seed sown, and that it was so directed
purely for my sustenance, on that wild
miserable place.
This touched my heart a little, and
brought tears out of my eyes; and I
began to bless myself that such a pro-
digy of nature should happen upon my
account: and this was the more strange
to me, because I saw near it still, all
along by the side of tile rock, some
other straggling stalks, which proved
to be stalk* of rice, and which I knew,
because I had seen it grow in Africa,
when I was ashore there.
I not only thought these the pure
productions of Providence for my sup-
port, but, not doubting that there was
more in the place, I went over all that
putt-of the island where I had been be*
fore, searching in every corner, and
under every rock, for more of it; but
I could not find any. At last it occur-
red to my thoughts, that I had shook
out a bag of cbickeu's-meat in that
place, and then the wonder began to
cease: and I must confess, my religi-
ous thankfulness to God's providence
began to abate too, upon the discover-
ing that all this was nothing but what
was common; though I ought to have
been as thankful for so strange and
unforsecn a providence, as if it had
been miraculous: for it was really the
work of Providence, as to me, that
should order or appoint that ten or
twelve grains of corn should remain
unspoiled, when the rats had destroyed
all the rest, as if it had been dropt
from heaven; as also, that I should
throw it out in that particular place,
where, it being in the shade of a high
rock, it sprang up immediately;
whereas, if I had thrown it any where
else, at that time, it would have been
burnt up and destroyed.
I carefully saved the cars of this
corn, you may be sure, in their season,
which was about the end of June; and,
laying up every corn, 1 resolved to sow
them all again; hoping, in time, to
have some quantity sufficient jto sup-
ply me with bread. But it was not
till the fourth year that I could allow
myself the least grain of this corn to
eat, and even then but sparingly, as I
shall show afterwards, in its order;
for I lost all that I sowed the tirst sea-
son, by not observing the proper time;
as I sowed just before the dry season,
so that it never came up at ail, at
least not as it would have done; of
which in its place.
Besides this barley, there were, as
above, twenty or thirty stalks of rice,
which I preserved with the same care;
and whose use 'was of the same kind,
or to the same purpose, viz. to make
me bread, or rather food; for I found
ways to cook it up without baking,
though I did that also after some
time.—But to return to my Journal.
I worked excessively hatfi these
three or four months, to get my, wall
done; and the 14th of April I closed it
up; contriving to get intoJt, not fry a
door but over the wall by &'ladder,
 
42
ADVENTURES OF
that there might be no sign on the
outside of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder; so
I.went up with the ladder to the top,
and then pulled it up after me, and
let it down in the inside: this was a
complete enclosure to me; for within
I had room enough, and nothing could
come at me from without, unless it
could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall
was finished, I had almost all my la-
bour overthrown at once, and myself
Hilled; the case was thus:—As I was
busy in the inside of it, behind my
tent, just at the entrance into my cave,
I was terribly frightened with a most
dreadful surprising thing indeed: for,
all on a sudden, I found the earth
come crumbling down from the roof
of my cave, and from the edge of the
hill over my head, and two of the
posts I had set up in the cave cracked
m a frightful manner. I was heartily
scared; but thought nothing of what
really was the cause, only thinking
that the top of my cave was falling in,
as some of it had done before: and
for fear I should be buried in it, I ran
forward to my ladder, and not thinking
myself safe their neither, I got over
my wall for fear of the pieces of the
hill which I expected might roll down
upon me. I had no sooner stepped
down upon the firm ground, than I
plainly saw it was a terribly earth-
quake: for the ground I stood on shook
three times at about eight minutes dis-
tance, with three such shocks as would
have overturned the strongest building
that could be supposed to have stood
on the earth: and a great piece of the
top of a rock, which stood about half a
mile from me, next the sea, fell down
with such a terrible noise as I never
heard in all my life. I perceived also
that the very sea was put into a violent
motion by it; and I believe the shocks
were stronger under the water, than
on the island.
I ww so much amazed with the
thing itself (having never felt the like
nor discoursed with any one that had)
that I was like one dead or stupHkd;
and the motion of the earth made my
stomach sick, like one that was tossed
airg$a; but the noise of the falling of
the rock awaked me, as it Were; and
rousing me from the stupified condk
tion I was in, filled me with horror^
and I thought of nothing but the hill
falling upon my tent and my house-
hold goods, and Iwrving all at once;
this sunk my very soul within me a
second time.
After the third shock was over,
and I felt no more for some time, I
began to take courage; yet I had not
heart enough to go over my wall
again, for fear of being buried alive,
but set still upon the ground greatly
cast down, and disconsolate, not know-
ing what to do. All this while I had
not the least serious religious thought;
nothing but the common, Lord, have
mercy upon me! and when it Was over
that went away too.
While I set thus, I found the air
overcast and grow cloudy, as if it
would rain; and soon after the wind
rose by little and little, so that in
less than half an hour it blew a most
dreadful hurricane; the sea was, all
on a sudden, covered with foam and
froth; the shore was covered with a
breach of the water; the trees were
torn up by the roots; and a terrible
storm it was. This held about three
hours, and then began to abate; and
in two hours more it was quite calm,
and began to rain very hard. All this
while I set upon the ground, very
much terrified and dejected; when,
on a sudden it came into my thoughts,
that these winds and rain being the
the consequence of the earthquake,
the earthquake itself was spent and
over, and I might venture into my
cave again. With this thought my
spirits began to revive $ and the rain
also helping to persuade me, I went
in, and sat down in my tent; but the
rain was so violent, that my tent was
ready to be beaten down with it; and
I was forced* to get into my cave,
though very muc^ afraid and uneasy
for fear it should fall upon my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new
work, viz. to cut a hole through my
new fortification, like a sink, to let
the water go out which would else
have drowned my cave. After I had
been in my cave for some time, and
found no more shock? of the earth-
43
quake follow I began to be more
composed. And now to support my
spirits, which indeed wanted it very
much, I went to my little store, and
took a small sup of rum; which how-
ever I did then and always very spar-
ingly * knowing I could have no more
when that was gone. It continued
raining all that night, and great part
or* the next day, so that I could not
stir abroad: but my mind being more
composed I began to think of what
1 had best do; concluding that if the
island was subject to earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a
cave, but I must consider of building
me some little hut in an open place,
which I might surround with a wall,
a«j I had done here, and so make my-
self secure from wild beasts or men:
for if I staid where I was, I should
certainly, one time or other, be buried
alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to
remove my tent from the place where
it now stood, being just under the
hanging precipice of the hill, and which,
if it should be shaken again, would
certainly fall upon my tent. I spent
the two next days, being the 19th and
20th of April, in contriving where
and how to remove my habitation
The fear of being swallowed alive
affected mc so, that I never slept in
quiet; and yet the apprehension of
lying abroad, without any fence, was
almost equal to it: but still, when I look-
ed about, and saw how every thing was
put in order, how pleasantly I was
concealed, and how safe from danger,
it made me very loth to remove. In the
mean time it occurred to me that it
would require a vast deal of time for
ore-to do this; and that I must be
contented to run the risk where I was
till I had formed a convenient camp,
and secured it so as to remove to it.
With this conclusion I composed my-
self for a time: and resolved that I
would go to work with all speed to
build me a wall with piles and cables,
&e. in a circle as before, and set up
my tent in it when it was finished:
but that I would venture to stay where
I was till it was ready, aad fit to re-
move to* This was the 21st.
April 2% The next morning I
!>egan to consider of the means to put
this measure into execution; but I
was at a great loss about the tools. I
had three large axes, and abundance of
hatchets (for we carried the hatchets for
traffic with the Indians); but with much
chopping and cutting kuotty hard wood,
they were all (ull of notches, and dull:
and though I had a grind-stone, I
could not turn it and grind my tools
too. This caused me as much thought
as a statesmen would have bestowed
upon a grand point of politics, or a
judge upon the life and death of a
man. At length 1 contrived a wheel
with a string, to turn ic with my foot,
that I might have both my hands at
liberty.
Note. I had never seen any such
thing in England, or at least not to
take notice how it was done, though
since I have observed it is very com-
mon there: besides, that, my grind-
stone was very large and heavy. This
machine cost me a full week's work
to bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole
days I took up in grinding my tools,
my machine for turning my grind-stone
performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived that my
bread had been low a great while, I
now took a survey of it, and reduced
myself to one biscuit-cake a day,
which made my heart very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking to-*
ward the sea-side, the tide being low,
I saw something lie on the shore Digger
than ordinary,"and it looked like a
cask: when"I came to it, I found a
small barrel, and two or three pieces of
the wreck of the ship, which were
driven on shore by the late hurricane;
and looking towards the wreck itself, 1
thought it deemed to lie higher out of
the water than it used to do. I examined
the barrel that was driven on shore,
and soon found it was a barrel of gun-
powder: but it had taken wateri and
the powder was caked as hard as a
stone: however, I rolled it farther on
the shore for the present, and wfent
on upon the sands, as near as I could
to the wreck of the ship/to fodk fdr
more.
When I came down to the Mp, I
found it strangely removed. Thefore^
44
ADVENTURES OF
 
 
castle, which lay before buried in sand,
was heaved up at least six feel; and
the stern (which was broke to pieces,
and parted from the rest, by the force
of the sea, soon after I had left rum-
maging 0f her) was tossed, as it were,
up, and east; on one side: and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next
her stern, that I could now walk quite
up to her when the tide was out;
whereas there was a great piece of
water before, so that I could not come
within a quarter of a mite of the wreck
without swimming*. I was surprised
with this at'first, but soon concluded it
must be done by the earthquake; and
m by this violence the ship was more
broke open than formerly, so many
things came daily on shore, which the
sea had loosened, and which the winds
and water rolled by decrees to the
land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts
from the design of removing my habi-
tation; and I busied myself mightily,
I hat day especially, in searching whether
I could make any way into the ship:
but. 1 found nothing was to be expected
of that kind, for all the inside of the
ship was choked up with sand. How-
ever, as ! had learned not to despair of
any thing, I resolved to pull every
thing to pieces that I could of the ship,
concluding that every thing I 'could get
from her would be of some use'or
other to me.
<Maif3, I began with my saw, and
cut apiece of 'a beam through, which
I thought held some of the upper part
or quarter-deck together; and when 1
had cut it through, 1 cleared away the
saw! as well as I could from the side
which 'lay highest; but the tide coming
in, I was obliged to give over for that
time.
, May 4. !went a-fishing, but caught
not one fish that I durst eat of, till I
was weary of my sport, when, just
going to leave off, 1 caught a young
dolphin. • 1 had "made «e along Ike
of' sortie tope-yarn, but 1 had no hooks $
yet'I frequently caught Ish enough, as
much 'as I cared to eat 5 all which' 1
dried-in the sun, and ate them1 dry.
''May 5. Worked1 on the wreck: cut
another "beam >astmcter,' and brought
thrle 'great' fir-pkiits off from1 the
decks; which f tied together, and nuwle
swim on shore when the tide of Hood
came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck; got
several iron bolts out of her, ami other
pieces of iron-work; worked very
hard, and came home very much
tired, and had thoughts of giving it
over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again,,
but not with an intent to work: but-
found the weight of the wreck had
broke itself down, the beams being
cut; that several pieces of the ship
seemed to lie loose; and the inside of
the hold lay so open that I could see
into it; but almost full of water and
sand.
May 8, Went to the wreck, and
carried an iron crow to wrench up the
deck, which lay now quite clear of the
water and sand. I wrenched up two
planks, and brought them on shore
also with the tide." I left the iron crow
in the wreck for next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and
with the crow made way into the body
of the wreck, and felt several casks,
and loosened them with the crow, but
could not break them up. 1 felt also
a roll of English lead, and could stir it;
but it was too heavy to remove.
May 10 to 14. Went every day to
the wreck; and got a great many pieces
of timber, and boards, or plank, and
two or three hundred weight of iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to
try if I could not cut a piece off the
roll of lead, by placing the edge of one
hatchet, and driving it with the other;
but as it lay about a foot and a half in
the water, I could not make any blow
to drive the hatchet.
May 16. It had blown hard in the
night, and the wreck appeared more
broken by the force of the water; but
I staid so long in the woods, to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented
my going to the wreck that day.
may 17> I saw some pieces of the
wreck hi own on shore, at a great
distance, two miles off me, but resolved
to see what they were, and found it was
a piece of the head, but too heavy for
me to bring away.
May 24. Every clay, to this day, I
worked on the wreck; and with hard
IIOB1NS0N ORUSOIi
45
 
 
labour I loosened some tilings so much
with the crow, that the first blowing1
tide several casks floated out, and two
of the seamen's chests; but the wind
blowing* from the shore, nothing came
to land that day but pieces of timber,
and a hogshead, which had some Brasil
pork in it, but the salt water and
the sand had spoiled it. I continued
tills work every day to the J 5th of .June,
except the time necessary to get food;
which 1 always appointed, during this
part of my employment, to be when
the tide was up, that 1 might be' ready
when it was ebbed out: and by this
time 1 had gotten timber, and'plank,
and iron-work, enough to have built a
good boat, if 1 had known how; and 1
also got, at several times, and in several
pieces, near one hundred weight of the
the sheet-lead.
June 16. Going down to the sea-
side, I found a large tortoise, or turtle.
This was the first I had seen; which,
it seems, was only my misfortune, not
any defect of the place, or scarcity:
for had 1 happened to be on the other
side of the island, I might have had
hundreds of them every day, as 1 found
afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.
June 17. 1 spent in cooking the
turtle. 1 found in her threescore eggs;
and her flesh was to me, at that time,
the' most savoury and pleasant that I
ever tasted in my life; having' had no
no flesh, but of* goats and fowls, since
I landed in this horrid place.
June 18. Rained all that day, and I
staid'within. I thought, at this lime,
the rain felt cold, ancl 1 was somewhat
chilly; which 1 knew was not usual
in that latitude.  #
'June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as
if'the weather had been cold,
\JmteW, Na rest all night; violent
pains in my head, and feverish,
Jtme 21. Very 111 3 frightened al-
most to death with the apprehensions
of my sad, condition, to he sick, and
no help: prayed to God for the first
time 'since the storm off Hull';: but
scarce knew what I said, or why, my
thoughts being all confused
June 22. A little better; but under
dreadful Apprehensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again; cold and
shivering, and then a violent head-ache,
June 24 Much better.
June 26. An ague very violent:
the lit held me seven hours: cold fit,
and hot, with faint sweats after it.
June 26, Better; and having" 110
victuals to eat, took my gun, but found
myself very weak: however, 1 killed a
she-goat, and with much difficulty got
it home, and broiled some of it, and
ate. I would fain have slewed it, and
made some broth, but had no pot.
June 2/. The ague again so vio-
lent that I lay abed all day, and neither
ate nor drank, I was ready to perish
for thirst; but so weak, 1 had not
strength to stand up, or, to get myself
any water to drink. Frayed to (hid
again, but was light headed: and when
1 was not, I was so ignorant that I
knew not what to say; only lay and
cried, Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity
me! Lord, have mercy upon me! 1
suppose 1 did nothing else for two or
three hours; till the lit wearing off, 1
fell asleep, and did not wake till'far in
the night When 1 awoke, 1 found
myself much refreshed, but weak, and
exceeding thirsty: however, us I had
no water" in my whole habitation, 1
was forced to lie till morning, and went
to sleep again. In this second sleep, I
had this terrible dream: I thought that
I was sitting on the ground, on the out-
side of my wall, where 1 sat when the
storm blew after the earthquake, and
that I saw a man descend from ft |reat
black cloud, in a bright lame of Ire,
and light upon thong round; he was all
over as bright as * a flame,, so that, 1
could but just bear to look towards
him; his countenance was most inex-
pressibly 'dreadful, impossible for
words to describe; when he stepped
upon the ground with his fefet, I
thought the earth,trembled, just as /it
had done before in the earthquake > ami
all'the air looked, to my apprehension,,
as if it had, been'filled with flashes, of
fire, He had no sooner laaded typon A©
earth, hut he moved forward; towards..
me, with a long spear or weapon in Ipf,,
hand, to kill me.; and when he camj&ito

ADVENTURES OF
rible tliat it is impossible to express
the terror of it: all that I can say I
understood, was this: Seeing all these
things have not brought thee to re-
pentance, now thou shalt die; at which
which words, I thought he lifted up
the spear that was iu his hand, to kill me.
, No one that shall ever read this ac-
count, will expect that I should be
able to describe the horrors of soul
at this terrible vision; I mean, that
even while it was a dream, I even
dreamed of those horrors; nor is it
any more possible to describe the im-
pression that remained upon my mind
when I awaked, and found it was but a
dream.
I had, alas I no divine knowledge:
what I had received by the good in-
struction of my father was then worn
out, by an uninterrupted series, for
eight years, of seafaring wickedness,
and a constant conversation with none
but such as were, like myself, wicked
and profane to the last degree. I do
not remember that I had, in all that
time, one thought that so much as
tended either to looking upward to-
wards God, or inward towards a reflec-
tion upon my own ways: but a certain
stupidity of soul, without desire of
good, or consciousness of evil, had
entirely overwhelmed me; and I was
all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common
sailors, can be supposed to be; not
having the least sense either of the
fear of God, in danger, or of thankful-
ness to him, in deliverances.
In the relating what is already past
of my story, this "will be the more
easily believed, when I shall add, that
through all the variety of miseries that
had to this day befallen me, I never
had so much as one thought of its
being the hand of God, or that it was
a just punishment for my sin; either
my rebellious behaviour against my
father, or my present sim*, which were
great $ or even as a punishment for the
general course of my wicked life.
'When I was on the desperate exjpe-
dition on the desert shores of Africa,
I never had so much as one thought
of what would become of me: or one
wish to God to direct me whither I
should go, or to keep me from the
danger which apparently surrounded
me, as well from voracious creatures
as cruel savages: but L was quite
thoughtless of a God or a Providence;
acted like a mere brute, from the prin-
ciples of nature, and by the dictates of
common sense only; and indeed hardly
that. When I was delivered and taken
up at sea by the Portuguese captain,
well used, and dealt with justly and
honorably, as well as charitably, I had
not the least thankfulness in my
thoughts. When, again, I was ship-
wrecked, ruined, and in danger of
drowning, on this island, I was as far
from remorse, or looking on it as a
judgment: I only said to myself often,
that I was an unfortunate dog, and
born to be always miserable.
It is true, when I first got on shore
here and found ail my ship's crew
drowned, and myself spared, I was
surprised with a kind of ecstasy, and
some transports of soul, which, had
the grace of God assisted, might have
come up to true thankfulness; but it
ended where it began, in a mere com-
mon flight of joy; or, as I may say,
being glad I was alive, without the
least reflection upon the distinguished
goodness of the hand which had pre-
served me, and had singled me out to
be preserved when all the rest were
destroyed, or an inquiry why Provi-
dence had been thus merciful to me:
just the same common Bort of joy
which seamen generally have, after
they are got safe to shore after a ship-
wreck; which they generally drown
all in the next bowl of punch, and
forget almost as soon as it is . over;
and all4he rest of my life was like it.
Even when I was, afterwards, on due
consideration, made sensible of my con-
dition—how I was cast on this dreadful
place, out of the reach of human kind,
out of all hope of relief, or prospect of
redemption,—as soon as I saw but a
prospect of living, and that I should
not starve and perish for hunger, all
the sense of my affliction wore off, and
I began to be very easy, applied my-
self to the works proper for my pre-
servation and supply, and was far
enough from being afflicted at my con-
47
dition, as a judgment from heaven, or
as the hand of God against me: these
were thoughts which very seldom en-
tered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is
hinted in my journal, had, at first,
some little influence upon me, and be-
gan to affect me with seriousness, as
long as I thought it had something mi-
raculous in it; but as soon as that
part of the thought was removed, all
the impression which was raised from it
wore off also, as I have noted already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing
could be more terrible in its nature, or
more immediately directing to the in-
visible Power which alone directs such
things, yet no sooner was the fright
over, but the impression it had made
went off also. I had no more sense
of God, or His judgments, much less
of the present affliction of my circum-
stances being from His hand, than if I
had been in the most prosperous con-
dition of life. But now, when I be-
gan to be sick, and a leisure view of
the miseries of death came to place
itself before me; when my spirits
began to sink under the burthen of
a strong distemper, and nature was
exhausted with the violence of the
fever; conscience, that had slept so
long, began to awake; and I reproach-
ed myself with my past life, in which
I had so evidently, by uncommon
wickedness, provoked the justice of
God# to lay me under uncommon
strokes, and to deal with me in so vin-
dictive a manner. These reflections
oppressed me for the second or third
day of my distemper; and in the
violence, as well of the fever as of the
dreadful reproaches of my conscience,
extorted from me some words like
praying to God: though I cannot say
it was a prayer attended either with
desires or with hopes; it was rather
the voice of mere fright and distress.
My thoughts were confused; the con-
victions great upon my mind; and
the horror of dying in such a misera-
ble condition, raised vapours in my
head with the mere apprehension:
and, in these hurries of my soul, I
knew not what my tongue might ex-
press: but it was rather exclamation,
such as, Lord, what a miserable crea-
ture ami! If I should be sick, 1
shall certainly die for want of help;
and what will become of me? Then
the tears burst out of my eyes, and
I could say no more for a good
while.- In this interval, the good ad-
vice of my father came to my mind,
and presently his prediction, which
I mentioned at the beginning of this
story, viz. that if I did take this fool-
ish step, God would not bless me;
and I should have leisure hereafter
to reflect upon having neglected his
counsel, when there might be none
to assist in my recovery. Now, said
I, aloud, my dear father's words are
come to puss; God's justice has over-
taken me, and I have none to help or
hear me. I rejected the voice of Pro-
vidence, which had mercifully put me
in a station of life wherein I might
have been happy, and easy; but I
would neither see it myself, nor learn
from my parents to know the blessing
of it. I left them to mourn over my
folly; and now I am left to mourn
under the consequences of it: I re-
fused their help and asistance, who
would have pushed me in the world,
and would have made every thing easy
to me; and now I have difficulties to
struggle with, too great for even nature
itself to support; and no assistance,
no comfort, no advice. Then I cried
out, Lord> be my help, for I am in
great distress. This was the first
prayer if I may call it so, that I had
made for many years. But I return
to my Journal.
June 28. Having been somewhat
refreshed with the sleep I had had,
and the fit being entirely off, I got up;
and though the fright and terror of
my dream was very great, yet I con-
sidered that the fit of the ague would
return again the next day, and now
was my time to get something to
refresh and support myself when I
should be ill. The first thing I did
was to fill a large squaie case-bottle
with water; and set it upon my table,
in reach of*my bed: and to take off
the chill or aguish disposition of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint
of rum into it, and mixed them toge-
ther. Then I got me a piece of tne
goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals

ADVENTURES OF
garded the deliverance 1 had received;
and. I was, as it were, made to ask
myself such questions f» these, viz.
Hare I not'been delivered, and won-
derfully too, from sickness; from the
most" distressed condition that could
be, and that was so frightful to me?
and what notice. have I taken of' it?
Have 1 done my part! Gocl has deli-
vered rne» but ! have not glorified him;
that is to say, 1 have not owned and
been thankful for that as a deliverance:
and how can 1 expect a greater deli-
verance? This touched my heart very
much; and immediately 1 knelt down,
and gave God thanks aloud for my re-
covery from my sickness,
July 4. In the .morning 1 took the
Bible; and beginning at the New Tes-
tament, 1 began seriously to read it;
and imposed upon myself to jcacl
awhile every morning and every night;
not binding myself to the number of
chapters, but'as long as my thoughts
should engage me. "It was not long af-
ter 1 set seriously to this work, that!
found my heart more deeply and sin-
cerely affected with the wickedness of
my past life. The impression of my
dream revived; and the words. All
these things have not brought thee to
repentance, ran seriously in my
thoughts, 1 was earnestly begging of
God to'give me repentance, when it
happened providentially, the very same
day,  that, reading the Scripture, I
caine to these worths, "He is exalted
a Prince and a Saviour; to give re-
pentance, and to give remission." I
threw down the book; and with my
heart as well as my hands lifted up to
heaven in a kind or ecstacy of jo?, 1
cried out aloud, Jesus, thou son of Da-
vid! Jesus, thou exalted Prince^ and
Saviour! give me repentance! This
 was the first  time in all my life!
could say, in the true. sense of the
.-words*-that I prayed; for now^i pray-
ed, with a sense of my conditio^, and
with-a true scripture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the
word 'of God-; and- from this time, I
may say, 1 began to have hope that
: God would hear me.
 ,. Now I began to construe the? words
. ikiejitiQBed above, "Call on me,.and 1
;... will i deliver thee," in a'different sense
from what 1 had ever (lone before; for-
then 1 had no notion of r.ny thing
being called deliverance, but my, being
delivered from the captivity 1 was in:
for though 1 was indeed at large in the
place, yet the island was certainly a
prison to me, and that in the worst
sense in the world. But now 1 learn-
ed to take it in another sense: now I
looked back upon my past life with
such horror, and my sins appeared so
dreadful, that my soul sought nothing
of Gocl but deliverance from the load
of guilt that bore down all my com-
fort. As for my solitary life, it was
nothing; 1 did not so much as pray to
be delivered from it, or think of it; it
was all of no consideration, in com-
parison with this. And I add this part
here, to hint to whoever shall read it,
that whenever they come to a true
sense of things,  they will find deliver-
ance from sin a much greater blessing
than deliverance from affliction. But,
indeed this part, 1 return to my
Journal.
My condition began now to be,
though not less miserable as to my
way of living, yet much easier to my
mind: and my thoughts being direct-
ed, by constantly reading the scripture
and praying to God, to things of a
higher nature, I had a great deal of
comfort within, which, till now, 1
knew nothing of; also, as my health
and strength, returned, I bestired me
to furnish myself with every thing
that I wanted, and make my way of
living as regular as 1 could.
From the 4th of July to< the 14th,
I mm chiefly employed ' in walking
about with my gun in my hand, a
little and a little at a time, as a man
that was gathering tip his strength
after a fit of sickness: for it is hardly
to be imagined how low i was and to
what weakness 1 was reduced. The
application which I made use of was
perfectly new, and perhaps what. had
never cured an ague before $ neither
can 1 recommend it to any one to prac-
tise, by this experiment: and though
it did carry off the fit, yet it rather
contributed to weakening me; for I
had frequent convulsions in my nerves
and limbs for some time i  1 learned
from it also this, in 'particular ; 'that
 
51
lit kg a broad in the rainy season was
the most pernicious thing to my health
that could be, especially in those rains
which came attended with storms and
hurricanes of wind; for as the rain
which came in the dry season was al-
most always accompanied with such
storms, so ! fouud that this rain was
much more dangerous than the rain
which fell in September and October.
f had now been in this unhappy
Island above ten months: all possi-
bility of deliverance from this con-
dition scorned to he entirely taken from
roe ; and I firmly believed that no hu-
man shape had ever set foot upon that
place. Having secured my habitation,
as I thought, fully to my mind, I had
a great desire to make a more perfect
discovery of the island,, and to see
what other productions I might find,
which I yet knew nothing of
It was on the 15th of .July that I
began to take a more particular sur-
vey of the island itself. I went up the
creek first, where, as I hinted, 1
brought my rafts on shore. I found,
after f came about two miles up, that
the tide did not flow any higher; and
that it was no more than a little brook
of running water, very fresh and good:
but this being the dry season, there
was hardly any water in some parts of
it; at least, not any stream. On the
bunks of this brook 1 found many
pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain,
smooth, and covered with grass: and
on the rising part* of them, next to
the higher grounds (where the water,
as it might be supposed, never over-
sowed), I found a great deal of tobac-
co, green, and growing to a very great
and strong stalk: and there were
divers other plants, which I had no
knowledge of, or understanding about,
and that might, perhaps have virtues
of their own, which ! could not find
out. I searched for the cassava root,
which the Indians, in all that climate,
make their bread of; but I could find
none. 1 saw large plants of aloes;
'but.did not understand them. 1 saw
several sugar-canes, but wild-; and, for
want of cultivation, imperfect. 1 eon-
'-tented -myself with these discoveries
for this time j. and came back,' musing
with myself what course I might take
to know the virtue and goodnes of any
of the fruits or plants "which I should
discover ; but could bring it to hO: con-
clusion; for, in short, I had made 80
little observation while 1 wasurtte
Brazils, that i knew little of the plants
in the field; at least, very little that
might serve me to any purpose mm
in my distress.   :;
Tlic next day, the Kith, 1 went up
the same way again; and after going*
something farther than I had gone the
day before, 1 found the brook and the
savannahs begin' to cease, and the
country became more woody than
before. In this part 1 found different
fruits ; and particularly I found melons
upon the ground, in great abundance,
and grapes upon the trees: the vines,
indeed, had spread over the trees, and
the clusters of grapes were now just in
their prime, very ripe and rich. This
was a surprising discovery, and I was
exceedingly glad of them, but I was
warned by my experience to cat spar-
ingly of them; remembering thatwhen
I was ashore in Barbary, the eating of
grapes killed several of our English-
men, who were slaves there, by throwing
them into fluxes and fevers, I found,
however, an excellent use for these
grapes; and that was to cure or .dry
them in the sun, and keep them -as
dried grapes or raisin?! are kept; which
I thought would be (m indeed they
were) us wholesome and as agreeable
to eat, when no grapes were to be 'had.
1 spent all that evening there, and
went not back to my habitation; which,
by the way, was the first} night, as I
might say, I had lain from home. At
night, I took my first contrivance,; -rid
got up into a tree, where 1 slept well;
and the next morning proceeded' on
my discover? travel ling near four miles,
as* I might judge by the- length of the
valley; keeping still due north,'with a
ridge of hills on the south 'and-north
sides of nae. At the end'of this march
1 came to an opening, where the'Ctt tn-
try seemed to descend to the west §* And
a little spring of fresh water, which1 is-
sued out of the side'of the hill-by me,
ran the other way,' that isy -dire- east;
and the'country appeared 'So fresh, so
green, so flourishing, 'every thing ba%ig
in a constant verdure^ * or' flourish of

spring, that it looked like a planted
garden. I. descended a little on the
side .of that delicious vale, surveying
It with ft secret kind of pleasure (though
mixed with other afflicting thoughts),
to think that this was all my own; that
I was king and lord of all this country
indefeasibly, and had a right of posses-
sion; and, if 1 could convey it, I might
have it in inheritance as completely as
any lord of a manor in England. 1 saw
here abundance of cocoa trees, and
orange, lemon, and citron trees, hut all
wild, and very few hearing any fruit j at
least not then. However, the green
limes that I gathered were not only
pleasant to eat, but very wholesome;
and I mixed their juice afterwards with
water, which made it very wholesome,
and very cool and refreshing. I found
now 1 had business enough to gather
and carry home; and I resolved"to lay
up a store, as well of grapes as limes
and lemons to furnish myself for the
wet season* which 1 knew was ap-
proaching. In order to this, I gathered
a great heap of grapes in one place, a
lesser heap in another place; and a
great parcel of limes and melons in
another place; and, taking a few of
each with me, 1 travelled homeward j
and resolved to come again, and bring
a bag or sack, or what 1 could make
to, carry the rest home. Accordingly,
having-spent three days in this journey,
1 came home (so I must now call my
tent and my cave) *, but before 1 got
thither, the grapes were spoiled; the
richness of the fruits, and the weight
of the juice, having broken and bruised
them, they were" good for little or
nothing; as to the limes, they were
good, but 1 could bring only a few.
; 'The next day being the l?)tb» i went
back, having made me two small bags to
bring, botoe my harvest; but I was
surprised, when, coming to my heap of
grapes, which were so rich and tine
w-he&. 1 gathered them, I found them
all' spread, about, trod to pieces, and
flagged about, some here, some there,
^..abundance* eaten and devoured,
Bfethis ,.I .concluded there were some
w0. creatures thereabouts which had
ijfyp$,%\a&, 'but what tliey were 1 knew
ttft./;"t|inye?er, as 1 found, there was
no'laying1 them up in heaps, and no
carrying them away in a sack; but that
one way they would be destroyed, and
the other way they would be crushed
with their own weight; 1 took another
course: 1 then gathered a large quan-
tity of the grapes, and hung them upon
the out-branches of the trees, that they
might cure and dry in the sun; and as
for the limes and lemons, f carried as
many back as 1 could well stand under.
When 1 came home from this jour-
ney, I contemplated with great pleasure
the fruitfulness of that valley, and the
pleasantness of the situation, the se-
curity from storms on that side$ the
water and the wood: and concluded
that 1 hail pitched upon a place to fix
my abode in, which was by far the
worst part of the country. Upon the
whole, I began to consider of removing
my habitation, and to look out for a
place equally safe m where 1 was now
situate; if possible, in that pleasant
fruitful part of the island.
This thought ran long in my head;
and 1 was exceeding fond of it for some
time, the pleasantness of the place
tempting me: but when 1 came to a
nearer view of it, I considered that 1
was now by the sea-side, where it was
at least possible that something might
happen to my advantage, and, by the
same ill-fate that brought me hither,
might bring some other unhappy
wretches to the same place; and
though it was scarce probable that any
such thing should ever happen, yet to
enclose myself among the hills and
woods in the centre of the island, was
to anticipate my bondage, and to ren-
der such an affair not only improbable,
but impossible; and that therefore I
ought not by any means, to remove.
However, 1 wag so enamoured of this
place, that I spent much of my time
there for the whole remaining part of
the month of July; and though, upon
second thoughts, I resolved, as above
stated, not to remove; yet I built me a
little kind of a bower, and surrounded
it at a distance with a strong fence,
being a double hedge, as. high as 1
could reach, well staked, and filled
between with brush-wood. Here I lay
very secure, sometimes two or three
nights, together; always going over it
with a. ladder, as before: so that ! fan-
53
 
t'ieci now 1 had my country and my
sea*coast house. This work took me
up till the beg Inning of Aug ust.
I had but "newly finished my fence,
and began to enjoy niy labour, when
the rains came on, and made me stick
close to my first habitation : tor though
1 had made a tent like the other, with
a piece of sail, and spread it very well,
yet I had not the shelter of a hill to
keep me from storms, nor a cave be-
hind lite to retreat into when the rains
were extraordinary.
About tiic beginning of August, as I
said, 1 had finished my bower, and be-
gan to enjoy myself. The M of Au-
guat, 1 found the grapes ! had hung
up were perfectly dried, and indeed
were excellent good raisins of the sun:
so 1 began to take them clown from the
trees; and it was very happy that 1
did so, as the rains which followed
would have spoiled them, and 1 should
have lost the best part of my winter
food; for I had above two hundred
large bunches of them, No sooner
had 1 taken till them down, and carried
most of them home to my cave, but it
began to rain: and from hence, which
was the 14th of August, it rained, more
or less, every day till the middle of
October; and sometimes so violently,
that 1 could not stir out of my cave for
several days.
In this season, 1 was much surprised
with the increase of my family. I had
been concerned for the loss of one of
my eats, who ran away from mc, or, as
f thought had been dead; and 1 heard
no more of her, till to my astonish-
ment, she came home with three kit-
tens. This was the more strange to
mc, because., about the end of August,
though 1 had killed a wild cat, as I
called it, with my gun, yet 1 thought it
was quite a dliferent kind from our
European cats; yet the young eats were
the same kind of house-breed as the old
one; and both of my eats being females,
! thought it very strange. But from
these three, 1 afterwards came to be so
pestered with cats, that !was forced to
kill them like vermin, or wild beasts,
and to drive them from my house as
much as possible.
From the 14th of August to the 26th,
incessant rain; so that I coiiki not stir,
and was now very careful not to be
much wet. In this confinement, I be-
gan to be straitened for food; but ven-
turing out twice, I one day killed a
goat, and the last day, which was the
26th, fotm \ a very large tortoise, which
was a treat to me My food was .. ,w
regulated thus: 1 ate a bunch of raisins
for my breakfast; a piece of the goafs
flesh,'or of the turtle, broiled, for my
dinner (for, to my great misfortune,
1 had no vessel to boil or stew tiny
thing); and two or three of the tur-
tle's eggs for my supper.
During this confinement in my cover
by the rain, I worked daily two or three
hours at enlarging my cave: and by de-
grees worked it on towards one aide,
till 1 came to the outside of the hill;
and made a door, or way out, which
came beyond my fence or wall; and so
I came in and out this way. But I was
not perfectly easy at lying 'so open; for
as 1 had managed myself before, f was
in a perfect enclosure; whereas now, 1
thought I lay exposed; and yet 1 could
not perceive that there was any living
thing to fear, the biggest creature that
I liacl yet seen upon the island being a
goat.
September 30, I was now come to
the unhappy anniversary of my landing,
I east up the notches on my pmif and
found ! had been on shore three hun-
dred and sixty-five days. I kept this
day as a solemn fast; setting it apart
for religious exercise, prostrating my-
self on" the ground with the most se-
rious humiliation, confessing my sins
to God, acknowledging his righteous
judgments upon me, and praying to
him to have mercy on mc through Je-
sus Christ; and having not tasted the
least refreshment for' twelve hours,
even till the going down'of the sun, 1
then ate a biscuit and a bunch of
grapes, and went to bed, finishing the
day as I began it. I had all this time ob-
served no sabbath-day 5 for as at first 1
had no sense of religion upon, my mind,
I had, after some time, omitted to dis-
tinguish the weeks, by making a lott|#
notch than ordinary for the; sibbalf*-
day, and so did, not really know what
any of the days were,; but ndw Maying
cast up'the lays as abbvG, l^faoidl

ADVENTURES OF
 
into weeks, and set apart every seventh
day for a sabbath: though J fount!» at
the end of my account, 1 had lost a day
or two In my reckoning'. A little after
this, my ink beginning to fail me,. 1
contented myself to use it more spar-
ingly; and to write down only the
most remarkable events of my life,
without continuing a daily memoran-
dum of other things.
The rainy season and the dry season
began now to appear regular to me,
and I learned to divide them so as to.
provide for them accordingly; but I
bought till my experience before 1 had
it; and what I am going to relate was
one of the most discouraging experi-
ments that 1 had made at all.
1 have mentioned that I had save
the. few ears of barley, and rice, which
1 had so surprisingly found sprung up,
as 1 thought of themselves. I believe
there were about thirty stalks of rice,
and about twenty of barley! and now
I thought it a proper time to sow it
after the rains; the sun being in lu
southern position going from me.
Accordingly I dug a piece of ground,
as well as 1 could with my wooden
spade; and dividing it into two parts,
1 sowed my grain," but as 1 was sow-
ing, if casually occured to my thoughts
that I would not sow it all at first,
because I did not know when was the
proper time for it; so I sowed about
two-thirds of the seed, leaving about
a handful 'of each: and it was a great
comfort to me afterwards that 1 did so,
for not one grain of what I sowed
this time came to any thing; for the
dry month following, and the earth
having thus' had no rain after the seed
was sown, it had no moisture to assist
its .growth, and never came up at all,
till the wet season had come again,
and then it grew as if it had been
but newly sown. Finding my first seed
did not grow, which 1 easily imagined
was from the draught, 1, sought for
a mpister piece of ground to make
another trial in; and I dug tip a piece
of ground near my new bower, and
30wed the rest of my seed in February,
ft-little before the vernal equinox.
This having the rainy months of March
mi April to w ater It, (sprung up very
pleasantly* and yielded a very good
crop ^ but having only part of the seed
left, and not daring to sow all that I
had, I got but a small quantity at last,
my wrhole crop not amounting to above-
half a peek of each kind. But by
this experiment 1 was made master.
of my business, and knew exactly
when was the proper time to sow1;
and that I might expect two seed-
times, and two harvests, every year.
While this com was growing, 1
made a little discovery, which was of
use to me afterwards. As soon as
the rains were over, and the weather
began to settle, which was about the
month of November, I made a visit
up the country to my bower; where
though 1 had not been some months,
yet I found all things just as I left
them, The circle or double hedge
that 1 had made was not only firm and
entire, but the stakes which I had cut-
out of some trees, that grew therea-
bouts, were all shot out and grown
with long branches, as much as a
willow-tree usually shoots the first
year after lopping its head; hut 1
could not tell what tree to call' it, that
these stakes were cut from. I was
surprised, and yet very weii pleased,
to see the young trees grow; and 1
pruned them, arid led them to grow
as much alike as I could; and it is
scarce credible how beautiful a figure
they grew into in three years; so "that
though the hedge made a circle-of
about twenty-five yards in diameter,
yet the trees, for such 1 might now
call them, soon covered it, and it' was
a complete shade, sufficient to lodge
under all the dry season. This made
made me resolve to cut some more
stakes, and make me a hedge like this
in a simicircle round my wall (I mean
that of my first dwelling), which 1
did; and placing the trees or stakes
in a double row", at about eight yards
distance from my first fence,  they
grew presently; and were at first a
fine cover to my habitation, and af-
terwards served for a defence also; as
I shall observe in its,order.
I found now that the seasons .of
the year might generally be divided,
not into summer and winter, as in
Europe, but into the rainy seasons and
the dry seasons, which were generally
 
 
m
thus: from the middle of February to
the middle of April, rainy; the*sail
being then on, or near the equinox.
From the middle of April till the mid-
dle of August, dry; the sun being
then north of the line, From the
middle of August till the middle of
October, rainy; the sun being then
come back to the line, From the
middle of October till the middle of
February, dry; the sun being then
to the south of the line.
The rainy seasons held sometimes
longer, and sometimes shorter, as the
winds happened to blow; but this
was the general observation 1 made.
After 1 had found, by experience, the
ill consequences of being abroad in the
ruin, 1 took care to furnish myself
with provisions beforehand, that I
might not be obliged to go out; and
1 s»t within doors as much as possible
during the wet months. This time
1 found much employment, and very
suitable also to the time; for 1 found
great occasion for many things which
1 had no way to furnish myself with
but by har<{ labour and constant ap-
plication: particularly, I tried many
ways to make myself a basket: but
all the twigs I could get for the pur-
pose proved so brittle, that they would
do nothing. It proved of excellent
advantage to me now, that when I was
it boy, I used to take great delight in
standing at a basket maker's in the
town were my father lived, to see
them make their wicker-ware j anil
being, as boys usually are, very of-
ficious to help, and a great observer
of the manner how they worked those
. things, and sometimes lending a hand,
1 had by these means fall knowledge
of the methods of it, so that I wanted
nothing but the material; when it
came into my mind, that the twigs of
that tree from whence 1 cut my stakes
that grew, might possibly be as tough
as the sallows, willows, 'and osiers, in
England; and 1 resolved to try. Ac-
cordingly, the next day, I went to
my country-house, as* I called it;
and cutting some of the smaller twigs,
1 found them to my purpose as uracil
as I could desire: whereupon 1 came-
the next time prepared with a hatchet
to cut down a quantity, which 1 soon
found, for there wm great plenty of
them. These I set up to dry within
my circle or hedge: and when they
were fit for use, I" carried thorn to my
cave: and here, during the next sea-
son, I employed myself in making,
as well us I could, several baskets;
both to carry earth, or to carry or
lay up any tiling as I had occasion for.
Though t did "not finish them very
handsomely, yet 1 made them  suf-
ficiently serviceable for my purpose;
and thus, afterwards, 1 took cure never
to be without them; and as my wicker,
ware decayed 1 made more; especial-
ly strong deep baskets, to place my
corn in, instead of sacks, when I
should come to have any quantity of
it.
Having mastered this difficulty,
and employed a world of time about
it, I bestirred myself to .tee, if possi-
ble, how to supply two other wants.
1 had no vessel to'hold any'thing that
was liquid, except two runlets, which
were almost full of rum; and some
glass bottles, some of the common size,
and others (which were case-bottles)
square, for the holding of waters,
spirits, &e. 1 hud not so much as a
pot to boil any thing; except a great
kettle, which 1 saved out of the ship:
and which was too big for such use as
1 desired it, viz. to make broth, and
stew a bit of meat by itself. The
second thing I would fain have had, was
a tobacco-pipe; but it was impossible
for me to make one; however-1 found
a contrivance for that to at last, I
employed myself in planting my se-
cond row of stakes, or piles, and also
in this wicker-working, all the sum-
mer or dry season; when another
business took me up more time than
it could tie imagined 1 could spare,'
! mentioned "before, that I had a
great mind to see the whole island;
and that 1 had travelled up the brook,
and so on to where 1 had built my
bower, and where I had an opening
quite to the sea, on the other side of
the island. I now resolved to travel
(piite across to the sea-shore, on that
gide: so taking my gun, a hatchet,
and my dog, and a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usual j' with two
biscuit-cakes, and a great 'bunch of

raising in my pouch, for my store; 1 be-
gwt my journey.' When 1 had passed the
vale where toy bower stood, as above, 1
came within view of the sea, to .the
west i and it being* a very clear day,
1 'fairly desfried land, whether an
klaad or continent, 1 could not tell;
frat it lay very high, extending* from
W. to W. S. W. at a very great distance;
* by my guess it could not be less than
fifteen or twenty leagues oiT,
1 could not tell what part of the
world this might bej otherwise than
that I knew it must be part of Ame-
rica; and, as 1 concluded, by all my
observation*, must be near the Spanish
dominions, and perhaps was all inha-
bited by savages, where if I should
have landed, 1 had been in a worse
condition than 1 was now. 1 therefore
acquiesced in the dispositions of Pro-
vidence, which I began now to own
and to believe ordered every thing for
the best; I say 1 quieted my mind with
this, and left off afflicting myself with
fruitless wishes of being* there.
Besides, after some pause upon this
affMr, 1 considered that if this land
was the Spanish coast, I should cer-
tainly, one time or other, see some
vessel pass or repass one way or other;
but If not, then it was the savage coast
between the Spanish country and the
the Brazils, whose inhabitants are in-
deed the worst of savages; for they
are cannibals, or men eaters, and fail
not to murder and devour all human
beings that foil into their hands.
With these considerations, walking
very leisurely" forward, I found this
side of the island, where 1 now was,
much pleasanter than mine; the open
or savannah fields sweetly adorned with
lexers and grass, and full of very fine
woods. I saw abundance of parrots;
and,fain would have caught one, if
possible, to have kept it to 'be tame,
and tau|ht it'to speak to me. 1 did,
alter taking some pains, catch a ypung
pftrrot \ for 1 knocked it down with a
stick," and, 'having recovered it, I
'brought it home: but it was some
yeari befqre I could make him speak $
however, at last, 1 taught him to call
irie'by wiy name verv familiarly, , .But
the"''accident that followed,, though It
be a trifle, will be very diverting in it*
place,
1 was exceedingly amused with this
journey. 1 found m the low grounds
hares, as 1 thought them to be,, and
foxes; but they "differed greatly from
all the other kinds 1 had met with; nor
could 1 satisfy myself to eat thei%
though I killed several. But 1 had no
need to be venturous: for 1 had no
want of food, and of that which was
very good too; especially these three
sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle,
or tortoise. With these, added to
my grapes, Leadenhall-market could
not have furnished a table better than
I, in proportion to the company; and
though my case was deplorable enough,
yet I"had great cause for thankfulness;
as I'was not driven to any extremities
for food, but had rather plenty, even to
dainties.
1 never travelled on this journey
above two miles outright in a day, or
thereabout$ but 1 took so mauy turns
and returns, to see what discoveries I
could make, that 1 came weary enough
to the place where 1 resolved to 'Sit
down for the night; and then I either
reposed myself in a tree, or sur-
rounded myself with a row of stakes,
set upright in the ground, either from
one tree to another, or. m as no wild
creature could come at me without
waking me.
As soon as 1 came to the sea-shore,
1 was surprised to see that I had takeu
up my lot on the worst side of the
island: for here indeed the shore was
covered with innumerable turtles;
whereas, on the other side, 1 had
found but three in a year and a half.
Here was also an infinite number of
fowls of many kinds; some of which
I had seen and some of which I had
not seen before, and many of them
very good meat; but such as 1 knew
not the names of, except  those called
Penguins.
1 could have shot as many as I
pleased, but was very 'Sparing, of my
powder and shot; and - therefore bad
more uiind to kill a she-goat, if. I
could, which I could better feed on.-

yet it vvr* with much more difficulty
that I could conn*, near them j the
country being flat and even, and they
sitw mc much sooner than when 1 was
upon a hill.
I confess this side of the country
was much pleasanter than mine ;'yct I
Intel not the least inclination to remove;
floras I was fixed in my habitation» it
became natural to me, and 1 seemed
all the while I was here to be as it were
upon « journey, and from home. How-
ever, 1 travelled along the sea-shore
towards the east, I suppose about
twelve miles: and then setting1 up a
great pole upon the; shore for a murk,
I concluded 1 would go home again;
and that the next journey I took
should he on the cither side of the
island, east from my dwelling*, and m
round till I came to my post again: of
which in its place.
1 took another way to come hack
than that 1 went, thinking I could
easily keep so much of the island in
my view, that 1 could not miss my first
dwelling by viewing the country: but
I found myself mistaken; for being
come about two or three miles, I
found myself descended into a very
large valley, but so surrounded with
hills, and "those hills covered with
wood, that 1 could not see which was
my wtty by any direction hut that of
the sun, nor even then, unless 1 knew
very well the position of the sun at
that time of the day. And it happened
to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved' hazy for three or four
dap while I was in this valley; and not
being able to see the sun, 1 wandered
about very uncomfortable, and at last
was obliged to find out the' sea-side,
look for mv post, and come back the
same' way t went; and then by easy
journeys 1 tarried homeward, the
weather  being exceeding hot, and my
fun, ammunition, 'hatchet, and other
things very heavy.
In this journey, my dog surprised a
young kid, and 'seized upon' it j and
running to take hold of it, 1 caught it,
and saved it alive from the dog. 1
had a great mind to bring it home if I
could; for 1 had often been musing
whether it might not be possible to get
a kid or two, and m raise a breed of
tame goats, which -might *upplv me
when my powder and shot should be
all spent. 1 made u collar lor thw
little creature, and with a string which
! had made of some rope-yarn, which
I always carried about me, I led htm
along, "though with some difficulty, tilt
1 came to my bower, and there 1 en-
closed him and left him; for I \vm
very impatient to be at home, (mm
whence 1 had been ab.seut above a
month.
1 cannot express what a satisfaction
it wm to me to come into my old
hutch, and lie down in my hammock*
bed. This little wandering journey,
without a settled place of abode, hud
been so unpleasant to me, tliat my own
house, as I called it to myself* was a
perfect settlement to me, com pared to
that j and it rendered everything about
me so comfortable, that *1 resolved 1
would never go a great way from it
again, while it should be my lot to
stay on the island.
! reposed myself here a week, to
rest and regale myself after my long
journey: during which, most of the
time was taken up in the weight? af-
fair of making a cage for my roll,
who began no%v to be' more domestic,
and to be mighty well acquainted with
me. Then t began to think of the
poor kid which I had penned within
my little circle, and resolved to fetch
it home, or give it some food: ac-
cordingly 1 went, and found it where
1 left it* (for indeed it could not get
out), but was almost starred for want
of food, 1 went awl cut boughs of
trees, and branches of such shrubs as
! could find, and threw it over, and
having fed it, I tied it as 1 did, before,
to lead it away $ but it was so tame
with being hungry, that 1 had no need
to have tied it, for it followed me like
a dog: and as 1 continually fed it, the
creature became'so loving,'so gentle,
and so fond, that it was from that time
one of my domestics also, and would"
never leave me afterwards*
The rainy season of the autumnal
equinox was now come, and I kept tie
30th of September in the sarae^solemn
manner as before, being the anniversary
of my landing on the island: having
now been there two years, and no

ADVENTURES OF
more prospect of being6 delivered than
the Irst (fay 1 came there. 1 spent
the whole day in humble and thankful
acknowledgments for the many won-
derful mercies which my solitary con-
dition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely
more miserable. I gave humble and
hearty thanks to God for having been
pleased to discover to me, that it was
possible 1 might he more happy even
in this solitary condition, than 1 should
have been in the enjoyment of.society,
and in all the pleasures of the world:
that he could fully make up to me the
tlcneicneics of my solitary state, and
the want of human society, by his
presence, and the communications of
his grace to my soul; supporting,
comforting, and encouraging me to
depend upon his providence here, and
to hope lor his eternal presence here-
after.
 It was now that 1 begun sensibly to
feel how much more happy the life I
now led was, with all its miserable
circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable life I led all the past part
of my clays; and now I changed both
my sorrows and my joys: my very de-
sires altered, my affections changed
their gusts, and my delights were per-
fectly new from what they were at my
irst coming, or indeed for the two
years past*
• Before, as I walked about, either
on my hunting, or for viewing the
country, the anguish of my soul at my
-condition would break out upon me
on a sudden, and my very heart would
die within im, to think of the woods,
'the mountains, the deserts 1 was in;
and how 1 was a prisoner, locked up
with the eternal bars and bolts of the
•ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness,
<without redemption. In the midst of
the greatest composures of my mind,
this would break out upon me like a
storm, and make me wring my hands,
"and weep like a child: sometimes it
would take me in the middle of my
wmkf and I would immediately sit
down and sigh, and look upon the
'ground for-an hour or two together:
this was still worse to me 5 but' if I
eould hurst into tear% .or give vent to
my feelings by words,' it would go off;
and my grief being exhausted, would
abate.
But now 1 began to exercise myself
with new thoughts: 1 daily read the
word of God, and applied all the coin-
forts of it to my present state. One
morning, being very sad, I opened the-
Bible upon these words, *' I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee:" im-
mediately it occurred that these words
were to me; why else should they he
directed in such a manner, just at the
moment when I was mourning over
my condition, as one forsaken of God
and man? Well then, said I, if God,
does not forsake roe, of what ill con-
sequence can it be, or what matters it,
though the world should forsake me;
seeing on the other hand, if 1 had all
the world, and should lose the favour
and blessing of God, there would be
no comparison in the loss?
From this moment I began to con-
elude in my mind, that it was possible
for me to be more happy in this for-
saken, solitary condition, than it  was
probable I should ever have been in
any other particular state in the world;
and with this thought I was going to
give thanks to God for bringing mo to
this place, 1 know not what it was,
but something shocked my mind at
that thought, and I durst not speak
the words. How canst thou be such a
a hypocrite, said I, even audibly, to
pretend to be thankful for a condition,
which, however thou mayest endeavour
to be contented with, thou wonidst
rather pray heartily to be delivered
from? Here I stopped: but though I
could not say I thanked God for being
here, yet I sincerely gave thanks to
God for opening my eye?, by whatever
afflicting providences, to see the former
condition of my life, and to mourn for
my wickedness, and repent. I never
opened the Bible, or shut it, but my
• very soul within me, blessed God for
directing my friend in England, without
any order of mine, to pack it up
among my goods; and for assisting roe
afterwards to save it out of the wreck
of the ship.
'Thus, and in this disposition of
mind, I began my third'year;' and
though I jiave not given the reader
the trouble of so particular an account
 
 
 
ROBINSON Oltl-tfOK.
59
of my works this year as the first, yet
in general it may he observed, ^that 1
was very seldom* idle; hut having re-
gularly 'divided my time, according to
the several daily employments that
were hefore me; such as, first, My
duty to God, and the reading the
Scriptures, which 1 constantly set
apart some time for, thrice every day:
secondly, Going1 ah road with my gun
for food, which generally took me up
three hours every morning, when it
did not rain, thirdly, Ordering, curing,
preserving, and cooking what I had
killed or catched for my supply: these
took up great part of the day; also
it is to * he considered, that in the
middle of the day, when the sun was
in the zenith, the violence of the heat
was too great to stir out: so that
about four hours in the evening was
ull the time 1 could he supposed to
work in; with this exception, that
sometimes 1 changed my hours of
hunting and working, and went ^to
work in the morning, and abroad with
my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for lahour,
I desire may he added the exceeding 1p-
horiousness of my work; the many
hours which, for want of tools, want
of help, and want of skill, every thing
i did took up of my time: for example,
I was full two and forty days making
me a hoard for a long shelf, which I
wanted in my cave; whereas, two saw-
yers, with their tools and a saw-pit,
would have cut six of them out of the
same tree in half a day.
My case was this; it was a large tree
which was to he cut down, because my
hoard was to be a broad one.. This
tree I was three clays cutting down, and
two more in cutting off the boughs, and
reducing it to a log, or piece of timber,
With inexpressible hacking and hewing,
I reduced both the sides of it into chips,
till it was light enough to move; then
I turned it, and made one side of it
smooth and flat as a board from end to
end; then turning that side downward,
cut'the other side, till ^brought tfie
plank to be about three inches thick,
and smooth on both sides. Any one
may judge the labour of my bands in
such a -piece of work; but labour and
patience carried mc through that,
and runny other things: 1 only ob-
serve this in particular, to show the
reason why so "much of my time went
away with so little work, viz, that what
might be a little to be clone with help
and tools, was a vast labour, 'and re-
quired a prodigious time to do alone,
and by hand. Notwithstanding this,
with patience and labour 1 went, through
many things; and, indeed,-every thing
that my circumstances made neces-
sary for me to do, as will appear by
what follows.
1 was now in the months of Novem-
ber and December, expecting my crop
of barley and rice. The ground I had
manured* or dug up for them was not
great: for, as I observed, my seed of
each was not above the quantity of half
a peck, having lost one whole crop by
sowing in the dry season: but now my
crop promised very well; when, on it
sudden, I found 1 was in danger of
losing it all again by enemies of several
sorts", which it was' scarce possible to
keep from it; as, first, the goats, and
wih! creatures which I called hares,
who, tasting the sweetness of the blade,
lay in it night and day, as soon as it
i*ame up, ami ate it so close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into
stalk.
I saw no remedy for this, but by
making an enclosure about it with a
hedge, which 1 did with a great deal of
toil'; and the more, because it rehired
speed. However, as my arable land
was but small, suited to way crop,! got
it tolerably well fenced in about three
weeks time; and shooting some of the
creatures in the day-time, 1 set my dug
to guard it in the*night, tying him up
to a stake at the gate, where he would
stand and bark all night long; so in a
little time the enemies forsook the
place, and the com grew very strong
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts ruined roe before,
while my corn was in the blade, so the
birds were as likely to rtiin me now,
when it was in the ear; for going along
by the place to see how it throve, 1 saw
niy little crop surrounded with fowis,
I know not of how many sorts, .who
stood, as it were,'watching till 1 should
begone. Fimmediately let fly among
them (for 1 always had wy gua with
 
 
 
 
60
ADVENTURES OF
iuc); ,1 had no sooner slioi^ 'but
there rose up a little cloud of fowls,
which I had not seen at all, from among
the coin itself.
This touched me sensibly, for 1 fore-
saw that in a few days they would de-
vour all my hopes $ that I should he
starved, and never he able to raise a
crop at all $ and what to do 1 could not
tell: however, 1 resolved not to lose
my corn, if. possible, though 1 should
watch it night and day. In the first
place, 1 went among it, to see what da-
mage was already clone, arid found they
hait spoiled a good deal of it: but that
as it was yet too green for theni, the loss
was not so great, lint that the remain-
der was likely to be a goxid crop, if it
could be saved,
'i staid by it to load my gun, and then
coining away, 1 could easily see the
thieves sitting upon all the trees about
ine» as if they only waited till 1 was gone
away; and the event proved it to be so;
for as 1 walked off, as if gone, 1 was no
sooner out of their sight, than they
dropt down, one by one, into the corn
again, I was so provoked, that I could
not have patience to stay till more came
on, knowing that every grain they eat
now was, as it might be said, a peck-
loaf to me in the consequence; sq
coming up to the hedge, 1 fired again,
and killed three of them. This was
what 1 wished for; so I took them up,
and served them as we serve notorious
thieves in England, viz. hanged them
in chains, for a terror to others. It is
impossible to imagine that this should
have such an effect as it had; for the
fowls not only never came to the corn,
but, in short, the? forsook all that part
of the island,.and 1 could never see a
bird near the place as long as my scare-
crows hung there. This I was very glad
of, yon may be sure; and about the
latter end of December, which was our
second harvest of the year, 1 reaped my
com.
1 was sadly^ put to it for a scythe or
sickle to.cut it down; and all 1 could
do was to make one as well as I <couid,
out-of one ;of the broad swords, or cut-
lasses, which I sav.ed among, the anas
out of the ship. However, as my first
crop was but small, I had, no great dif-
ficulty to cut it down; in short I reaped
it my way, for 1 cut nothing off but
the ears, and carried it away in a great
basket which 1 had .inade* and m
rubbed it out with my hands; and at
the end of all my harvesting, I found
that out of my half-peek of seed, 1 had
near two bushels of rice,.and above
two bushels and a half of barley; that
is to say, by my guess, for I had, no
measure.
However, this was great encourage-
ment to me 5 and I foresaw that,. in
time, it would please <»od to supply
me with bread; and yet here 1 was per-
plexed again j for I neither knew how
to grind, or make meal of my corn, or
indeed how to clean it and part it; nor
if made into meal, how to make bread
of it; and if how to make it, yet 1 knew
not how to bake it: these things being
added to my desire of having a good
quantity for store, and to secure a con-
stant supply, I resolved not to taste any
of this crop, but to preserve it all for
seed against the next season; and, in
the mean time, to employ all my study
and hours of working to accomplish
this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.
It might be truly said, that now I
worked for my bread. It is a little
wonderful, and what 1 believe few peo-
ple have thought much upon, viz. the
strange multitude of little things neces-
sary in the providing, producing,curing,
dressing, making, and finishing this one
article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere state
of nature, found, this to my daily dis-
couragement, and was made more sen-
sible of it every hour, even after I had
got the first handful of seed-corn, which,
as 1 have said, came up unexpectedly,
and indeed to a surprise.
- First, I had no plough to turn up the
earth; no spade or shovel to dig it:
well, this I conquered, ,by making a
wooden spade, as I observed before $
but tins did my work k but a wooden
manner; and though it cost me a great
many days to make it, yet for want of
iron, it not only wore out the sooner,
but made my work the harder, and
performed It much worse. However,
this 1 bore with, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with
the badness of the performance. When
 
 
 
 
lit
 
the com was sown, I had no harrow,
hut was forced to go over it myself,
and drag1 a great heavy bough of a tree
over It, to scratch It, as it may be
called, rather than rake or harrow it.
When it was growing1 and grown, I
have observed' already how many
tiling's I wanted to fence it, secure it,
mow or reap It, cure and carry it home,
thresh, part it from the chaff, and save
it: then 1 wanted a mill to grind it,
sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to make
it ifito bread, and an oven to hake it;
and yet all these things 1 did without,
as shall he observed; and the com was
tin inestimable comfort aid advantage
to me: all this, as 1 said, made every,
thing laborious and tedious to me,
twit that there was no help for; net-
the was my time so much loss to me,
because, as 1 had divided it, a certain
part of it was every day appointed to
these works; and as 1 resolved to use
none of the corn for bread till 1 had a
greater quantity by me, 1 had the next
six months to apply myself wholly, by
labour and invention, to furnish myself
with utensils proper for the performing
all the operations necessary for making
corn It for my use.
But now 1 was to prepare more land;
for 1 had seed enough to sow above an
acre of ground Before 1 did this, 1
had a week's work at least to make me
a spade; which, when it was done, was
but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy,
and required double labour to work
with it; however, I went through that,
and sowed my seed in two large flat
pieces of ground, as near my house as
1 could find them to my mind, and
fenced them in with a good hedge ; the
stakes of which were'all cut off that
wood which 1 had set before, and knew
it would grow; so that, in one year's
time, 1 knew 1 should have a quick or
living hedge, that would want but little
repair. Thfe work took me up full
three months; because a great part of
the time was in the wet season, when I
could not go abroad. Within doors,
that is, when it rained, and I could not
go out, I found employment on the fol-
lowing' occasions; always observing,
that 'while ! %vas at work, ! diverted
myself with talking to my parrot, and
teaching him to speak'; and -1 quickly
learned him to know his own name, and
at hist to speak it out pretty loud, Poll;
which was the first word 1 ever heard
spoken in the island by any mouth but
my own. This, therefore, was not my
work, but an assistant to my work; for
now, as 1 said, 1 had a great employ-
ment upon my hand?, m follows J had
long* studied, by some means or other,
to make myself some earthen vessels,
which indeed 1 wanted much, but knew
not where to come at the in: how-
ever, considering the heat of the cli-
mate, 1 did not doubt but if I could
find out any elay, 1 might botch up
some such pot as might, being dried
in the sun, be hard and strong enough
to bear hand ling, and to hold any thing
that was dry, and required to be kept
so; and as*this was necessary in the
preparing corn, meal, &c. which was
the thing I was upon, 1 resolved to
make some as large as I could, and fit
only to stand like jars, to hold what
should be put into them.
It would make the reader pit? me,
or rather laugh at me, to tell how
many awkward ways 1 took to raise
this 'pastil; what odd, mishapen, ug-
ly tilings I made; how many of them
fell inland how many fell out, the elay
not being stiff* enough to bear its own
weight; how many cracked by the over
violent heat of the sun, being set out
too hastily; and how many fell in
pieces with only removing, as well be-
fore as after they were dried: and, in a
word, how, after having laboured hard
to find the elay, to dig it, to temper 
it, to bring it home and work it, 1
could not make above two largt* earth-
en ugly things (I cannot call them jars)
in about two months1 labour.
However, as the sun baked' these
"two very dry and hard, 1 lifted1 them
very gently "up, and them clown' again
in two' great wicker baskets, ivhich 1
had made on purpose for them, that
they might not break; and as between
the pot and the basket there'was a lit-
tle room to spare, I stuffed it'ftillof the
rice and barley'straw, and these t'w6 pbtfc
being to stand always dry, 1 thought
would hold 'my dry com,' and pertiitps
the meal, when the corn was braised/
Though 1 miscarried s© much in Way
design for large potsy yet I made se*e--
 
ADVENTURES OF
ral smaller tiling's with better success;
such as little round pots, flat dishes,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing
my hand turned to j and the heat of the
sun baked them very hard.
But all this would not answer my
eiidf which was to get an earthen pot to
hold liquids, and hear the Ire, which
none of these could do. It happened
some time after, making a pretty lar#e
lire for cooking- my meat, when I went
to put it out after 1 Intel done with it,
1 found a broken piece of one of my
earthen-ware vessels in the fire, burnt
as hard as a stone, and red as a tile,
1 was agreeably surprised to see it;
and said to myself, that certainly they
might be made to burn whole, if they
would burn broken.
,.. 'This set me to study how to order
my ire, so as to make it burn some
pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such
as the potters burn in, or of glazing
them with lead, though 1 had some
lead to do it with ; but 1 placed three
large pipkins and two or three pots in
a pile, one upon another, and placed
my fire-wood all round it, with a great
heap of embers under them. 1 plied
the fire with fresh fuel round the out-
side, and upon the top, till I saw the
pots in the inside red-hot quite through
and observed that they did not crack at
all; when 1 saw them clear red, 1 let
them stand in that heat about five or six
hours, till I found one of them, though
it did not crack, did welt or run j for
the sand which was mixed with the
clay incited by the violence of the heat,
and would have run into glass, if I had
gone on j so I slacked my ire gradual-
ly, till the pots began to abate of the
red colour; and watching them all
night, that I might not let the ire abate
too fast, in the morning I had three
very good, ! will not say handsome,
pipkins, and two other earthen pots,
as hard burnt as could be desired;
aud.one of them perfectly glazed with
the running of the sand,
. After this experiment, 1 need not
.say, that I wanted no sort of earthen-
ware for py use j but 1 must needs
-say,-; as to the shapes of them, they
were ?ery indifferent, as any one may
suppose, as I had no way of making*
them, but as the children make dirt
pies, or as a woman would make pies,
that never learned to raise paste.
No joy at a thing of m mean a
nature, was ever equal to mine, when
I found 1 had made an earthen pot
that would bear' the fire; and' 1 had
hardly patience to stay till they were
cold, before 1 set one on the Ire again,
with some water in it, to boil me some
meat, which it did admirably well;
and with a piece of a kid I made some
very food broth; though I  wanted
oatmeal, and several other ingredients
requisite to make it so good as 1 would
have had it been, n
My next 'concern was to get a stone
mortar to stamp or beat some corn in;
for as to the mill, there was no thought
of arriving" to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands, To supply
this want I was at a great loss; for,
of all trades in the world, 1 was as
perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter
as for any whatever; neither had 1 any
tools to go about it' with. I spent
many a clay to find out a great stone
big' enough to cut hollow, and make
It for a mortar; but could find none
at all, except what was in the solid
rock, and which 1 had no way to dig*
or cut out; nor, indeed, were the rocks
in the island of sufficient hardness, as
they were all of a sanclv crumbling'
stone, which would neither bear the
weight of a heavy pestle, nor would
break the corn without filling* it with
sand; so, after a great deal of time
lost in searching for a stone, 1 gave • it
over, and resolved to look out a ureal
block of hard wood, which 1 found
indeed much easier; and getting one
as big as I had strength to stir, I
rounded it, and formed it on the out-
side with my axe and hatchet; and
then, with the help of fire, and infinite
labour, made a hollow place in it, as
the Indians in Brazil make their canoes.
After this, 1 made a great heavy pes-
tle, or beater, of the wood called iron-
wood; and this 1 prepared and laid by
against I had my next crop of corn,
when I proposed to myself to grind, m
rather pound, my corn into meal, to
make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a
sieve, or search^ to dress my meal,
and to part it from the bran and the
 
 
 
il
 
husk, without which 1 did not see It
possible! could have any bread. This
was a moat difficult tiling, even but to
think on; for 1 had nothing like the
necessary thing to make it; 1 mean
fine thin canvas or stuff, to search the
meal through. Here 1 was at a full
stop for many months j nor did 1 real-
ly know what to do; linen 1 had none
left, but what was mere rags; 1 had
goats-hair, but' neither knew how to
weave it nor spin it; and had J known
how, here were no tools to work it
with*: all the remedy 1 found for this
was, at last recollecting I had among
the seamen's clothes which were saved
out of the ship, some neckcloths of
calico or muslin, with some pieces of
these I made three small sieves, proper
enough for the work; and thus ^ I
made shift for some years: ^ how 1 did
afterwards, 1 shall show in its place.
The baking* part was the next thing"
to be considered, and how 1 should
make bread when 1 came to have corn:
for, first, 1 had no yeast: as to that
part, there was no supplying the want,
so 1 did not concern myself much
about it; but for an oven 1 was in-
deed puzzled. At length 1 found
out an expedient for that also, which
was this; I made some earthen ves-
sels, very broad, but not deep, that is
to say, about two feet diameter, and
not above nine inches deep: these I
burned in the fire, as 1 had done the
other, and laid them by; and when I
wanted to bake, 1 made a great ire
upon my hearth, which I had paved
with some square tiles, of my own
making and burning also; but 1
should not call them square.
When the fire-wood was burned into
embers, or live coals, 1 drew them
forward upon the hearth, so as to cover
it all over, and there let them lie till
the hearth was very hot; then sweep-
ing away all the embers, 1 set down
my loaf, or loaves, and covering them
with Jthe earthen pot, drew the embers
all round the outside of the pot, to
keep in and add to the heat; and thus,
as well as in the best oven in the
world, I baked my barley-loaves, and
became, in a little time, a good pastry-
cook into the bargain; for 1 made
myself several cakes and puddings of
the rice; but made no pies, as 1 hud
nothing to put into thern except the
flcah of fowls or goats.
It need not be' wondered at, if aH
these things took trie up most part of
the third year of my abode here; for,
it is to be observed, in the intervals
of these things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: I reaped
my corn in its season, and carried it
home as well m 1 could, and laid jt
up in the ear, in my large baskets, till
I had time to rub it' out*"; for 1 had no
floor to thresh it on, or instrument to
thresh it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn
increasing, I really wanted to build my
barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay
it up in; for the increase of the corn
now yielded me so much, that I had
of the barley about twenty bushels,
and of rice *as much, or more, inso-
much that now I resolved to begin to
use it freely; for my bread had been
quite gone a great while; I resolved
also to see what quantity would be
sufficient for me a whole year, and to
sow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the
forty bushels of barky and rice were
much more than I could consume in a
year; so 1 resolved to sow just the
same quantity every year that 1 sowed
the I«st, in hopes that such a quantity
would fully provide me with bread,
All the while these things were
doing, you may be sure my thoughts
ran many times upon the prospect
of land which 1 had seen from the
other side of the island; and 1 was
not without some secret wishes that
1 was on shore there; fancying, that
seeing the main land, and an inhabited
country, 1 might find some way or
other to convey myself farther, and
perhaps at last find some means of
escape.
But all this while 1 made no allow-
ance for the dangers of such a condi-
tion, and that I might fal) into the
hands of savages, and "perhaps such
as 1 might have reason to think-"far
worse than the lions and tigers of
Africa; that if I once came into'their
power, 1 should run a hazard of more
titan a thousand to one of being

for'' 1 had heard that tie people of the
Caribbean coast were cannibals, of.

over the hopes of the boat, my desire
to venture over the main Increased, ra-'

it seemed impossible.
At length, I began to think whether
it was not possible to make  myself- a
canoe, or perfagua* such'as-the natives
of those cMiniates make, even without
tools, or, as 'I might stfy, without bands,
of the trunk of a great tree. This I*

ADVENTURES OP
 
I had neither the lust of the flesh, the
lust of ilie eye, nor the priic of life.
I. had nothing to covet, for 1 hail all
thai I • was now capable of enjoying:
I was lord of the whole manor; or,
if 1 pleased, ! might call myself king*
or emperor over the whole country
which I hail possession of; there were
no rivals; I had no competitor, none
to dispute sovereignty or command
with me: 1 might have raised ship-
loadings of corn, but i-hatl no use for
it; so I let as little grow as 1 thought
enough for my occasion, I had tortoise
or turtle enough, but now and then
one was as much as 1 could put to any
use: I had timber enough to have built
a fleet of ships; and 1 had grapes
enough to have made wine, or to have
cured into raisins, to have loaded that
fleet when it had been built.
But all 1 could make use of was
all that was valuable: 1 had enough
to-eat and supply my wants, and what
was the rest to me?* If I killed .more
flesh than I could eat, the dog must
eat it, or vermin; if I sowed more
corn than I could eat, it must be
spoiled: the trees that I cut clown were
lying to rot on the ground: I could
make no more use of them than for
fuel, and that I had no other occasion
-for but to dress my food.
In a word, the nature and experience
of things, dictated to me* upon just
•reflection, that all the good things of
this world are of no farther good to us
.than for our use; and that whatever we
.may heap up to give others, we enjoy
:only as much as we can use, ami no
more. The most covetous griping
miser in the world would have been
cured of the .vice of covetousness, if he
;had been in my ease; for I possessed
infinitely more than I knew what to do
with. I had naroom for desire, except
it was for things which 1 had not, and
>tbey were comparatively but trifles,
otao-ugli indeed of 'great use to me. I
.jbac)*. as  I Muted before, a parcel of
i»i#ney, as well gold as silver, about
thirty-si^ pounds sterling. Ala*! there
fte jtasty* *Qrry; useless stuff lay: I
*had»# manner-of 'business for it; and
,'i often thought within myself, that. I
..^rould'.h&ye given a handful of it for
tpgmm of tobam*-pipes*.or for a hand-
mill to grind my corn; nay, 1 would
have given it all for sixpenny-worth of
turnip and carrot seed from England,
or for a handful of peas .and beans, and
a bottle of ink. As It was, I had not
the least advantage by if, or benefit
from it; but there it lay in a drawer,
and grew mouldy with the damp of
the cave in the wet seasons; and if I
had had the drawer full of diamonds,
it had been the same ease,—they had
been of no manner of value to me be-
cause of no use.
1 had now brought my slate of life
to he much more comfortable in itself
than it was at first, and much easier to
my mind, as well as to my body. 1
frequently sat down to meat with
thankfulness, and admired the hand of
of God's providence, which had thus
spread my table in the wilderness: I
learned to look more upon the bright
side of my condition, and less upon
the dark side, and to consider what I
enjoyed, rather than what I wanted:
and this gave me sometimes such secret
comforts, that 1 cannot express them;
and which 1 take notice of here, to' put
those discontented people in mind of
it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what
God has given them, because they see
and covet something that lie has not
given them. All our discontents about
what w:% want, appeared to me to
spring from the want of thankfulness
for what we have.
Another reflection was of great use
to me, and doubtless would be so to
any one that should fall into such dis-
tress as mine was; arid this was, to
compare my present condition with
what 1 at first expected it would be;
nay, with what it would certainly have
been, if the good providence of God
had not wonderfully ordered the ship
to be cast up near to the shore, where
I not only could come at her, but
could bring what I got out of her, to
the shore,"for my relief and comfort;
without which, I had wanted for tools
to work, weapons for defence, arid
gunpowder and shot for getting' my
food.
1 spent whole hours, I may'My
whole clays, in representing to myself,
in the most lively colours, "hotv I fttuSt
 have' acted, if 'I had fcot nothing out of
 
 
 
ill
the ship. I could not have so much m
got any food, except fell and turtles;
and that, as it was long before I found
any of litem, 1 must have perished;
that 1 should have lived, if 1 had not
perished, like a mere savage; that if I
had killed a goat or a fowl, by any con-
trivances 1 had no way to flay or open
it, or part the flesh from the skin and
tire bowels, or to cut it up; but must
gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it with
my claws, like a beast.
These reflections made mo very sen-
sible oi the goodness of Providence to
me, and very thankful for my present
condition, with all its hardships and
mis fortunes: awl this part also 3 can-
not but recommend to the reflection of
those who are apt, in their misery, to
say, Is any affliction like mine? Let
them consider how much worse the
cases of .some people are, and their
case might have been, if Providence
had thought lit,
I had another reflection, which as-
sisted me also to comfort my mind
with hopes; and this was, comparing
my present condition with what 1 had
deserved, and had therefore reason to
expect from the hand of Providence.
I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly
destitute of the knowledge and fear of
God. I had been well instructed by
my father and mother; neither bail
they been wanting to me, in their
endeavours to infuse an early religious
awe of God into my mind, a sense of
my duty, and what the nature and end
of my being required of me. But,
alas! falling early into the seafaring-
life, which, of all lives, is the most des-
titute of the fear of God, though his
terrors are always before them; I say,
falling early into the seafaring life, ami
into seafaring company, all "that little
sense*of religion which I had enter-
tained was laughed out of jane by my
messmates; by a hardened despising
of clangers, and the views of death,
which grew habitual to mc; by my
long absence from all manner of op-
portunities to converse with any thing
but what was like myself, or to hear
any thing that was good, or tending
towards it
So void was 1 of every thing -that
was gmi, or of the least sense of what
 
I wis, or was to be, that in the greatest
deliverances I enjoyed (such m my
escape from Bailee, my being taken up
by (he Portuguese master of a ship,
my being planted so well in the Brazils,
my receiving the cargo from England,
and the like), I never had once the
words, Thank God, so much as on my
mind, or in my mouth; nor in the
greatest distress had I so much as a
thought to pray to him, or bo much as
to say, Lord, have mercy upon mc!
no, nor to mention the name of God,
unless it was to swear by, and blas-
pheme it,
I had terrible reflections upon m^
mind for many months, us I have
already observed, on account of my
wicked and. hardened life past; and
when I looked about me, and consi-
dered what particular providences had
attended me since my coming into this
place, and how God had dealt bounti-
fully with me,—had not only punislted
mc lc.*s than my iniquity had deserved,
but had so plentifully provided for rat),
—this gave mc great hopes that my
repentance was accepted, and that Goil
hail jet mercies in store for mc.
With these reflections, I worked my
mind up, not only to a resignation to
the will of God in the present disposi-
tion of my circumstances, but even to
a sincere thankfulness for my condi-
tion; and that I, who was yet* a living
man, ought not lo complain, seeing I
had not the due punishment of my
sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies
which I had no reason to have expected
in that place, that I ought never move
to repine at my condition, but to re-
joice, and to give daily thanks for tint
daily bread, which nothing but a crowd
of wonders could have brought; that'"!
ought to consider I had been fed H? a
miracle, even as great as that of feeding
Elijah by ravens"; nay, by a long serf*
of'miracles; and that i couUThattlty
have named a place iti the" uninhabi-

hurt;<no savages, to murder and de-
vour me. In a word, as my life was a
life of sorrow one way, so it was a life
of mercy another; and I wanted no-
thing to make it a life of comfort, but
to make myself sensible of God's good-
ness to me, and care over me in this
condition; and after 1 did make a just
improvement of these things, I went
away, and was no in ore sad.
I bad now been here so long, that
many things which I brought on shore
for, my help were either quite gone, or
very much wasted, and neat* spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been
gone for some time, all but a very
little, which 1 eked out with water, a
little and a Utile, till it was so pale, it
scarce left any appearance of black
upon the paper. An long as it lasted,
I made use of it to minute down the
days of the month on which any remark-
able thing happened to me: and, first,
by casting up times past, I remember
that there was a strange concurrence of
days,in the ?arious providences which
befel me, and which, if 1 had been su-
perstHiously inclined to observe days
as fatal or fortunate, I might have had
reason to have looked upon with a
great deal of curiosity.
First, I had observed, that the same
day that I broke away from my father
,niiil;iiiy friends, and ran away to Hull,
in ^rder to go to sea, the same clay
afterwards I was .taken by the Bailee
mail of war, and made a slave; the
same day of the year that I escaped
out of the wreck of the ship in Yar-
mouth Roads, that same day-year after-
wards I Made my escape from Saliee
ill the'boat: ,-and the same day of the
year 1 was bora on, viz, the 30th of
September, that same day I had my life
.so miraculously saved twenty- six years
after, when I was cast on snore in this
'island: so that my wicked life and my
'•solitary life began both on one day.
.-. -The -next tiling to my ink being
;,wasted, was that of my bread, I mean
,tfce.„Ms€pit which I. brought out of the
*thtpj'« this I had husbanded to the last
. degree* allowing'myself but one cake
of bread a day"for above a year; and
•. yet 1 was quite without bread for near
a.'year before I got any corn of my
•#w»j and great reason* I bad 4o be
thankful that I had any at all, the get-
ting it being, as has been already ob-
served, next to miraculous.
My clothes, too, began to decay
mightily: as to linen, I had none for a
great while, except some chequered
shirts which I found in the chests of
the other seamen, and which 1 carefully
preserved, because many times I could
bear no clothes on but a shirt; and it
was a very great help to me that 1 had,
among all the men's clothes of the
ship, almost three dozen of shirts.
There were also, indeed, several thick
watch-coats of the seamen's which
were left, but they were too hot to
wear; and though'it is true that the
weather was so violently hot that there
was no need of clothes, yet 1 could not
go quite naked, no, though I had been
inclined to it, which I was not, nor
could I abide the thought of it, though
I was all alone. The reason why I
could not go quite naked was, I could
not bear the heat of the, sun so well
when quite naked as with some clothes
on; nay, the.very heat frequently blis-
tered my skin: whereas, with a shirt
on, the air itself made some motion,
and whistling under the shirt, was two-
fold cooler than without it. No more
could ! ever bring myself to go out in
the heat of the sun "without "a cap or
hat; the heat of the sun beating with
such violence as it does in that place,
woidil give me the head-ach presently,
by darting so directly upon my head,
without a cap or hat on, so that I could
not bear it; whereas, if I put on my
hat, it would presently go away.
Upon these views, *I began to consi-
der about putting the few rags I had,
which I called cloth.es>'into some order:
I had worn out all the waiscoats I had,
and my business was now to try if I
could not make jackets out of the great
watch-coats that 1 had by me, and with
such other materials as 1 had ;^so I set
to work a tailoring, or rather indeed a
botching, for I made most piteous work
of it. However, 1 made shift to make
two or three new waistcoats, which 1
hoped would serve me a great while:
as for breeches or drawers, I made but
a very sorry shift indeed, till afterwards,
I We. mentioned, that i saved the
skias of all the creatures that I killed.
(B
 
I mean four-footed ones; and I had
filing them up, stretched out with
sticks, in the suu, by which means
some of them were so dry and hard that
they were fit for little, hut others!
found very useful. The first thing I
made of these was a great crap for my
head, with the hair on the outside, to
shoot off'the ruin; and this 1 performed
so well, that after this 1 made me a
suit of clothes wholly of the skins, that
w to sav, a waistcoat, and breeches,
open at the knees, and both loose; for
they were rather wanting to keep me
coo! than warm. I must not omit to
acknowledge that they were wretchedly
made; for"if I was a bad carpenter, 1
was a worse tailor. However, they
were such as 1 made very good shift
with; and when 1 was abroad, if it hap-
pened to rain, the hair of my waistcoat
and cap being uppermost, 1 was kept
very dry.
After this, 1 spent a great deal of
time and pains to make me an um-
brella: I was indeed in great want of
one, and had a great mind to make one;
1 had seen them made in the Brazils,
where they were very useful in the great
heats which are there; and I felt the
heats every jot as great here, unci
greater too*, being nearer the equinox:
besides, as 1 was obliged to be much
abroad, it was a most useful thing to
me, as well for the rains as the heats,
f took a world of pains at it, and was a
treat while before 1 could make any
ling likely to hold; nay, after I
thought 1 had hit the way, I spoiled
two or three before 1 made one to my
mind; but at last I made one that an-
swered indifferently well; the main
difficulty 1 found was to make it let
clown: J could make it spread, but if it
did not let down too, and draw in, it was
not portable for me any way but just
over my head, which would not do,
However, at last, as I said, ! made one
to answer, and covered it with skins,
the hair upwards, so that it cast off the
rain like a pent-house, and kept off the
sun so effectually, that I could walk
out in the hottest of the weather with
greater advantage than I could before in
the coolest; and when I had no need
of it, could close it, and carry it under
my arm,
Thus I lived mighty comfortably,
my mind being entirely composed by
resigning to the will of God, and
throwing myself wholly upon die dis-
posal of his providence. This made-
my life better than sociable; for when
1 began to regret the want of conver-
sation, I would ask myself, whether
thus conversing mutually with my
own thoughts, 'and, m 1 hope 1 may
say, with even God himself, by ejacu-
lations, was not better than^the utmost
enjoymcut of human society in the
world?
1 cannot say that after this, for five
years, any extraordinary thing hap-
pened to me, but 1 lived on in the
same course, in the same posture^and
place, just as before; the chief things
I was employed in, besides my yearly
labour of planting my barley and rice,
and curing my raisins, of both of which
I always kept up just enough to have
sufficient stock of one year's provision
beforehand; 1 say, besides this yearly
labour, and my daily pursuit of going
out with my gun, I liad one labour, to
make me a canoe, which at last 1'
finished: so that by digging a canal to
it, of six feet wide, and four feet deep,
I brought it into the creek, almost
half a "mile. As for the first, which
was so vastly big, as I made it without
considering beforehand, as 1 ought to
do, how 1 should be able to launch it,
so, never being able to bring it into the
water, or bring the water to it, 1 was
obliged to let it lie where it was, as a
memorpndum to teach me to be wiser
the next time: indeed, the next time,
though 1 could not "get a tree proper
for ft, and was in a place where 1
could not get the water to it at any
less distance than, as 1 have said,.near
half a mile, yet as 1 saw it was prao
ticable at last, 1 never gave it oven
and though 1 was near two years
about it,' yet 1 never grudged my
labour, in hopes of having a boat-to''go
of! to sea at last,  
However, though my little periagua.
was finished, yet the sfoe of it was not
at all answerable to  the design which I
had in view when I made the first; 1
mean, of venturing over to the iift^
firm.fif where it was above • forty-mile*
'broad; accordingly, tic srnaHncW' <*f
ADVBNTUJRES OF
 
my boat asBiHtcd to put aw end to that
cfesign, at»d now 1 thought no more of
it; As 1 had a boat, my next design
was to make a cruise round the island;
for m 1 had been on the other side in
one place, crossing1, as ! have already
described it, over the land, so the dis-
coveries I made in that little journey
made rue very eager to see other parts
of the coast; and now I had a boat, 1
thought of nothing but sailing round
^ the island.
For this purpose, that I might do
every thing with discretion and con-
sideration, 1 fitted up a little mast in
my boat, and made a sail to it out of
§ome of the pieces of the ship's sails
which lay in store, and of which 1 had
a great stock by me. Having fitted
my mast and sail, and tried the boat,
i found she would sail very well: then
1 made little lockers, or boxes, at each
end of in? boat, to put provisions,
necessaries, ammunition, &e. into, to
be kept dry, either from rain or the
spray of the sea; and a little long
hollow place 1 cut in the inside of the
boat, where 1 could lay my gun,
making* a lap to hang down over it,
to keep it dry.
I fixed my umbrella also in a step
at the stern, like a mast, to stand over
my head, and keep the heat of the sun
off me, like ait awning; and thus i
every now and then took a little voyage
upon the sea, but never went far out,
nor far from the little creek. 'At last,
being eager to view the circumference
of my little kingdom, 1 resolved upon
my cruise; and accordingly, I victualled
pi? ship for the voyage, putting in
two dozen of loaves (cakes 1 should
rather call them) of barley bread, an
earthen pot full of parched rice {a
food I ate a great deal of), a little
bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder
and shot for killing more, and two
large watchcoats, of those which, as I
mentioned before, I had saved out of
the seamen's chests; these 1 took, one
to lie upon, and the other to cover me
|n the night.
It was" the 6th of November, in the
sixth year of my reign or my captivity,
"'which you please, that I set out on
Jim voyage, and 1 found it much longer
'than I expected.;- for though the
island itself was not very large, yet
when 1 came to the east side of ,it, 1
found a great ledge of rocks lie out
about two leagues into the sea, gome
above water, gome under it; and be-
yond that a shoal of saud, lying dry
half a league more, so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to
double the point.
When tirst 1 discovered them, 1 was
going to give over my enterprise, and
come back again, not 'knowing how far
it might oblige me to go out to sea,
and, above all, doubting how 1 should
get back again; so I came to an
anchor; fori had made me a kind of
an anchor with a piece of a broken
grappling which I got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, 1 took my
gun and went on shore, climbing upon
a hill, which seemed to overlook that
point, where I saw the full extent of
it, and resolved to-venture.
In my viewing the sea from that
hill where I stood, 1 perceived a strong,
and indeed a most furious current,
which ran to the east, and even came
close to the point; and ! took the
more notice of it, because 1 saw there
might be some clanger, that when 1
came into it, I might be carried out to
sea by the strength of it, and not be
able to make the island again: and,
indeed, had I not got first upon this
hill, J believe it would have been so;
for there was the.same current on the
other side the island, only that it set
off at a farther distance* and i saw
there was a strong eddy under the
shore $ so 1 had nothing to do but to
get out of the first current, and 1
should presently be in an eddy.
1 lay here, however, two <lays, be*
cause the wind blowing pretty fresh at
E. S.E. and that being'just'Contrary to
the said current, made a great breach
of the sea upon the 'point; so that it
was not safe for me to keep too close
to the shore, for the breach, nor to go
too far off, because of the stream.
The third day, in the morning, the
wind having abated over-night, the
sea was calm, and 1 ventured; but 1
«in a warning-piece again to all rash
and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was
I .come to the point, when 1 was not
even my boat's length from the shore,
71
 
but! found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of
a mill; it carried my boat along with
it with such violence, that all I "could
do could not keep her so much as on
the edge of it; hut 1 found it hurried
me farther and farther out from the
eddy, which was on my left hand.
There was no wind stirring to help
me, and all I could do with my paddles
signified nothing: and now 1 began to
give myself over for lost; for as the
current* was on both sides of the
island, I knew in a few leagues distance
they mu^t join again, and then I was
irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any*
possibility of avoiding it; so that I
had no prospect before me hut of
perishing, not by the sea, for that was
ealin enough, hut of starving for
hunger. I had indeed found a tortoise
on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, and had tossed it into the boat;
and I had a great; jar of fresh water,
that is to say, one of my earthen pots;
but what was all this to being driven
into the vast ocean, where, to be sure,
there was no .shore, no main hind or
island, for a thousand leagues at
least?
And now I saw how easy it was fur
the providence of God to make even
the most miserable condition of man-
kind worse. Now I looked hack upon
my desolate solitary island, as the
most pleasant place In the world; and
all the happiness my heart could wish
for was to lie but there again. 1
stretched out my hands to it, with
eager wishes: () happy desert! paid I,
I shall never see thee more. O miser-
able creature! whither am 1' going!
Then 1 reproached myself with my
unthankful temper, and how I had re-
pined at my solitary condition; and
now what would 1 give to be on shore
there again! Thus we never see the
true state of our condition till It is
illustrated to us by its contraries, nor
know how to value what we enjoy, hut
by the want of it. It is scarce possible
to imagine the consternation I was
now in," being driven from my beloved
Island (for so it appeared to* me now
to be) .into the wide ocean, almost two
leagues, and in the utmost despair of
ever reentering it again. However, I
worked hah I, till indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, aim kept my
boat m much to the northward, that
is, towards the side of the current
which the eddy lay on, m possibly I
could; when about mum, us the «un
passed the meridian, I thought 1 felt
a little hrerze of wind in my fare,
springing up from S. >S. H. This
cheered my heart a little, and es-
pecially when, in about half an hour
more, it, blew a pretty gentle gale.
By this time I was got at a frightful
distance from the island, and had the
least cloudy or hazy weather inter*
vencd, I had been undone another way
too: for I had no compass on board,
and should never have known how to
have steered towards, the island. If 1
had hut once lost sight of it; but the
weather continuing clear, 1 applied
myself to get up my mast again, ami
spread my sail, standing away to the
north as much as possible, to get out
of the current.
lust us J had set itiy mast and sail,
and the boat began to si retch away, I
saw even by the clearness of the water
some alteration of the current was
near; for where the current waa so.
strong, the water was foul; but per-
ceiving the wafer clear, I found the
current abate; and presently 1 found
to the east, at about half u mile, a
breach of the sea upon some rucks:
these rocks 1 found caused the current
to part again, and its the main stress of
it ran away more southerly, leaving the
rocks to the north east, so the other
returned by the repulse of the rocks,
and made*a strong eddy, which ran
back again'to the north-west, with a
very sliarp stream. 
'f hey who know what it is to hare ft
reprieve brought to them upon/ the
ladder, or to be rescued from thieves
Just going to murder them, or who

ADVENTURES OF
 
#iri# the Maud, but about twoleagues
'More-to the north Ward than'the cur-
- rent which carried me away at'irst;
iothftt when I came near the island, I
'found myself open to the northern
shore ;of it, that is to'say, the oilier
end "of the island, opposite to that
which I went out from.
When 1 hid made something more
than 'a league of way by the help of
this' current dr eddy, ! found it was
spent,'- and served me no farther.
However, 1 found that being between
two" great currents, viz. that on the
'south side, which had hurried me
away, and that on the north, which
Iky mbout a league on the other side;
I'-say, 'between these two, in the wake
of the island, ! found the water at
least "Still, aiid running' no way; and
having still it breeze of wind fair for
me, 1 kept on steering directly for
the island, though not making such
fresh way as I did before.
About four oVloek in the evening,
being then within a league of the
island, 1 found the point of the rocks
which occasioned this disaster, stretch-
ing out, us is described before, to the
k southward, and easting off the current
more southerly, had, of course made
'another eddy to the north; and this 1
 found very strong, but not directly
setting the way my course lay, which
-was due west; but almost full north.
However, having a fresh gale, I
;• stretched across this eddy, slanting
north-west: and, in about an hour,
came within about a mile of the shore,
'.where, it'being smooth water, I soon
got to land.
'' When I was on shore, 1 fell on my
 knees, and gave Cod thanks for my
'deliverance,'" resdlviiur to lay aside all
thoughts of in? deliverance by my
'b^at; and refreshing myself with such
'things' as 1 had,' 1 brought my boat
close to the shore, in a little cove
that 1 had spied under some trees, and
laid" toe down to sleep, being quite
>ffeimVwith the labour and fatigue of
the'voyage*
'" T wits new at a great loss which way
tO' get home with: my boat : I had run
f*G,Jnitieh hazard,  aiicl knew' too much
^f the ckw9 to think of attempting'it
by I lie way 1 -went out; and what
might beat the other tide (1 iwwtti lite
west side) 1 knew not, ''ho* had 1 'any
mind to run any more: ventures; -so I
only resolved in the morning to wake
my way westward along* the shore,' and
'to see if there was no creek where J
might Jay up my frigate in safety, so as
to have her again, if 1 wanted her. Jn
about three miles,or thereabouts, coast-
ing the shore, I came to a very irood
inlet or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little
rivulet or brook, where I found a very
convenient harbour for my boat, and
where she lay as if she had been in a
little clock made on purpose for her.
Here I put in, and having stowed my
boat very safe, 1 went on shore, to
look about me, and see where I was.
1 soon found I had but a little pas-
sed by the place were I had been
before,* when J travelled on foot to that
shore j so taking nothing out of my
boat but my gun and umbrella, for it
was exceeding hot, 1 began my march.
The way was comfortable enough after
such a voyage as 1 had been upon, and
1 reached*'my old bower in the evening,
where 1 found every thing standing as
1 left it; for I always kept it in good
order, being, as 1 said before, my
country house.
I got over the fence, and laid me
clown in the shade, to re^t my limbs,
for 1 was very weary, and fell asleep:
but judge you, if you can, that read
my story, what a surprise 1 must'be
in, when 1 was awaked out of my sleep
by a voice, calling me by my name
several times, Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe; poor Robin Crusoe1.' Where
are you, llobin Crusoe? Where are
you? Where have you been?
1 was so dead asleep at first, being
fatigued with rowing, or paddling, as
It is called, the first part of the day,
and with walking the latter part, that
I did not wake thoroughly, but dozing
between sleeping and waking, tin light
I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me; but as the voice continued to
repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,
at last 1 began to wake more perfect-
ly, and was at first dreadfully frighten-
ed, and started up in the utmost con-
sternation; tiitt no 'sooner' were my
eyes open, but I saw my Foil sitting
?;t
 
01 the. top of the lieclge; and imme-
diately' knew that it was lie that spoke
tci me; for just in aueh bemoaning
language I had used to talk to him,
and teach him ; and lie had learned it
so perfectly, that he would sit upon my
finger, find Jay his bill close to my
fket\ and cry. Poor • Robin Crusoe!
Where, are you? Where have you
been? How came you here? and such
things as J hud taught him.
However, even though 1 knew it was
the parrot, and that indeed it could
lie nobody else, it was a good while
before I could compose myself. First,
I was amazed how the creature got
thither, and then, how lie should just
keep about the place, and no where
else: but m 1 was well satisfied it
could he nobody but honest Poll, 1 got
over it; and holding out my hand, and
vailing him by his name, Poll, the so-
ciable creature came to me, and sat
upon iny thumb, as he used to do,and
continued talking to me, Poor Robin
Crusoe! and how did I .come here?
and where had 1 been? just as if lie
bail been overjoyed to see me again:
and so i carried hiiii home along with
iim\
- I now had enough of rambling to
sea for some time, and had enough to
do for many days, to sit still and reflect
upon the danger I had been in. 1
would hare been very glad to have had
tny boat again on my side of the island;
but 1 knew not how it was practicable
•to gut it about. As to the east side of
the.inland, which 1 had gone round, I
knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that way; my very heart would
.shrink* and my very blood run chill,
but to think of it; and as to the other
side of the island, I did not know how
it might he there; but supposing the
current ran with the same force against
the shore at the east as it passed' by it
on the other, 1 might run the same
risk of being driven clown the stream»
and carried by the island, as 1 had been
before of being carried away from it;
so, with these thoughts, i contented
myself to be without any boat, though
it had bceu the product of so many
months labour, to make it, and of m
• many more to get it into the sea*
In this government of my temper I
remained near a year, lived a<.verr
sedate, retired life, as vow may,well
suppose; and my thoughts being very
much composed, as to my. condition,
and fully comforted 'in. resigning, my-
self to the dispositions of rrovidepec,
I thought f lived really very happily in
all thing«f except that.of society*'
I improved myself in this tim$ in
all the mechanic exercises which my
necessities put me upon applying my-
self to; and 1 believe I could, up ©n
occasion, have made a very good car-
penter, especially considering how few
tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unex-
pected perfection in my earthenware,
and contrived well enough to make
them with a wheel, which ! found in-
finitely easier and better; because, 1
made things round and shapahlc, which
before were filthy things indeed to look
on. But ! think I was never more
vain of my own performance, or more
joyful for any thing 1 found out, than
for my being able to make a tobacco-
pipe; and though it was a very, ugly
clumsy thing when it was done, and
only burnt red, like other earthenware,
yet as it was hard and firm, and woulu
draw the smoke, I was exceedingly
comforted with it, for I had been
always used to smoke: ami there were
pipes in the ship, but 1 forgot .them, at
first, not thinking that there was to-
bacco in the island; and afterwards
when 1 searched the ship again,;. 1
could not come at any pipes at alt, ,
In my wicker-ware also 1 improved
much, and made abundance of access-
ary baskets, as well as my invention
showed me; though not very handsome
yet they were such as were very handy
and. convenient for my laving' thing's
up in, or fetching things dome. _ For
example, if I killed a goat abroad^  I
could hang it up in a tree, lay it, dress
it, and cut in pieces, and bring it hope
in a basket; and the like by" a turtle:
1 could cut it up, take out the,^gs,
and a piece or two of the flesh, .wfiwli
was enough for me, and bring, them
home  in a basket, and leave the jest
behind me. Also large deep baskets
were the .receivers of my corn, which

ADVENTURES OF
 
1 always rubbed out as sooa as il was
dry, and cured, and kept it in great
baskets.
. 1 begun now to perceive uiy powder
filiated considerably; this was a want
which it was impossible for me to
supply, and 1 begun seriously to consi-
der what I must do when 1 should
have no more powder; that is to say,
how 1 should do to kill any yoats. J
had, as is observed, in the third year of
my being here, kept a young kid, and
bred her up tame, and I was in hopes
of getting a he-goat: but 1 could not
by any ibciwm bring it to pass, till my
kid grew an old gout; and as 1 could
never find in_ my heart to kill her, she
died at last of mere age.
But being now in the eleventh year
of my residence, and, as 1 have said,
my ammunition growing low, 1 set
myself to study s'oinc art to trap and
snare the goats, to see whether I could
m>t catch some of them alive; and
particularly, 1 wanted a she-goat great
with young. For this purpose, 1 made
snares to hamper them $ and I do be-
lieve they were more than once taken
in them $ but my tackle wastnot good,
for 1 had no wire, and 1 always found
jthem broken and my 'bait devoured.
At length 1 resolved to try a pit-fall:
so 1 ting several large pits in the earth
In .places where 1 had observed the
foats used to feed, and over those pits
placed hurdles, of my own making*
too, with a great weight upon them"';
and several times 1 put ears of barky
and dry rice, without setting the trap;
and 1 could easily perceive that the
goats, had gone in and eaten up the
corn, for 1 could see the marks of their
feet At length 1 set three traps in
oflc night, and going the next morning
, I found them all standing' and yet the
hail eaten and gone; this was very
discouraging. However, 1 altered my
traps; and, not to trouble you with
particulars, going one morning to see
my traps, 1 found in one of them a
largp old he-goat,, and in one of the
others three kids, a male and two
, females.
As to the old one, J knew not what
to do with Mm,; he was so fierce, I
durst not go into the -pit to him; that
Is to say, to go about to bring him
away alive, which was what 1,wanted;
I could have killed him, but that was
not my business, nor would it answer
my end j so I even let him out, and he
ran away, as if lie hail been frightened
out of his wits. But 1 had forgot then,
what J had learned afterwards, that
hunger will tame a lion. If 1 had let
him stay there three or four days with-
out food, and then have carried him
some water to drink, and then a little
corn, he would have been as tame as
one of the kids; for they are mighty
sagacious tractable creatures, when they
are well used.
However, for the present 1 let him
got knowing no better at that time: then'
1 went to ilie three kids, and taking them
one by one, 1 tied them with strings to-
gether, and with some difficulty brought
them ail home.
It was a good while before they would
feed; but throwing them some sweet
corn, it tempted, them, and they began
to be tame. And now 1 found that if
1 expected to supply myself with goafs
flesh when I had no powder or shot
left, breeding some up tame was my
only way; when, perhaps, 1 might
have them about my house like a flock
of sheep. But then it occurred to me,
that 1 must keep the tame from the
wild, or else they would always run
wild when they grew up: and the only
way for this was, to have some enclosed
piece of ground, well fenced, either
with hedge or pale, to keep them in so
effectually, that those within might not
break out, or those without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one
pair of hands; yet as I-saw there was an
absolute necessity for doing it* my first
work was to find out a proper piece of
ground, where there was likely to be
herbage for them to eat, water tor them
to drink, and cover to keep them from
the sun.
Those who understand such 'enclo-
sures will think ! had very little con-
.trivance,, when 1 pitched upon a place
very proper for all these (being a plain
open "piece of meadow land,or savannah,
-as our people call it in the western co-
lonics), which had two or three little
drills of fresh water in it, and at one end
was very woody $ I say, they will smile
at my forecast, when I shall tell them, 1
75
 
Imgmi my enclosing this piece of ground
in "such *a manner, that my hedge or
pale must have been at least two miles
abunt. Nor was the madness of it so
great as to the compass, for if it was
ten utiles about, 1 was tike to have time
enough to do it in; hut I did not con-
sider that my goat* would lie m wild in
sii much compass, as if they had had the
whole island, and 1 should have so much
rooin to chase them in, that i should
never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on,
1 helicve about fifty yards, when this
thought occurred to me; so 1 presently
stopped short, and, for the first begin-
ning, I resolved to enclose a piece of
about 150 yards in length, and 100
yards in breadth; which, us it would
maintain as many as f should have in
any reason a hie time, so, as my stock
increased, 1 eon Id add more ground to
my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence,
and I went to work with courage. I
was about three months hedging in the
first piece; and, till I had done it, J te-
thered the three kids in the best part
of it, and used them to feed as near
me as possible, to make them familiar;
and very often 1 would go and carry
them some ears of barley, or a handful
of rice, and feed them out of mv hand;
so that after in? enclosure was finished,
and 1 let them loose, they would follow
me up ^nd down, bleating after me for
a handful of corn,
 This answered my end ; and in about
a year and a half I had a flock of about
twelve goats, kids and all; and in two
years in ore, I had three and forty, be-
sides several that 1 took and killed for
my food. After that 1 enclosed five se-
veral pieces of ground to feed them in,
with little pens to drive them into, to
take them a? 1 wanted, and gates out of
one piece of ground into another.
But this was not all: for now 1 not
only hud goafs flesh to feed on when
I pleased, but milk too, a thing which,
indeed, in the beginning, I did not- so
much as think of, and which, when it
came into my thoughts, was really an
agreeable surprise •" for now 1 set tip
my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon
or two of milk in a day. And as na-
ture, who give* supplies of food to
every creature, dictates even naturally
how to make use of it; so I, that had
never milked a cow, much less a goat,
or seen butter or cheese made, only
when I was a boy, after a great many
essays and miscarriages, made me both
butter and cheese at last, and also salt
(though I found it partly made to my
baud by t lie heat of the run upon some
of the rocks of the sea), and never
wanted it afterwards. How mercifully
can our Creator treat his creatures,
even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruc-
tion I How can he sweeten the bitter-
est providences, and give us cause to
praise him for dungeons and prisons!
What a table was here spread for me in
a wilderness, where 1 saw nothing at
first, but to perish for hunger!
It would have made a stoic smile, (o
have seen me and my little family sit
down, to dinner : there was my majesty,
the prince and lord of the whole island;
f-had the lives of all my subjects at my
absolute command; 1 could hang, draw,
glee liberty, and take it away;*"and no
rebels among all my subjects. Then
to see how like a king I (lined too, all
alone, attended by my servants: Poll,
as if be had been my favourite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me.
My dog, who was now grown ?ery old
and crazy, and had found no species to
multiply his kind upon, sat always, at
my right hand; awl two cats, one on
one side of the table, and one on the
other, expecting now anil then a bit
from my hand, as a mark of special fa-
vour.
But these were not the two cats which
1 brought on shore at first, for they
were both of them dead, and had been
interred near my habitation by my own
hand; but one of them having multi-
plied, by 1 know not what kindt of crea-
ture, these were two which 1 had pre-
served lame; whereas the rest run wild
In the woods, and became indeed trou-
blesome to me at last, for they wotdd
often conic into my house, and plunder
me too, till at last I was obliged to
shoot them, and did kill a great many;
at length they left me. With this at-
tendance, arid in this plentiful manner,
1 lived; neither could 1 be said to want
any thing but society: and of that some
 
76
ADVENTURES OF
time after this, 1 was likely to have too
much.
1 was something impatient, as I have
observed, to have the use of my boat,
though very loth to run any more ha-
zards: ami therefore sometimes 1 sat
contriving ways to get her about the
island, and at other times 1 sat myself
down contented enough without her.
But 1 hud <t strange uneasiness in my
mind to go down" to the point of the
island, where, as I have said, in my last
ramble, i went up the hill to see* how
the shore Jay, and how the current set,
that 1 might see what 1 had to do i this
inclination increased upon 'me every
day, and at length 1 resolved to travel
thither by land, following the edge of
the shore. 1 did so; but had any one
in England been to meet such a man as
I was, it must either have frightened
him, or raised a great deal of laughter:
and as 1 frequently stood still to look
at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my travelling through York-
shire, with sueh aa equipage, and in
sueh a dress. Be pleased to take a

lU under iny left arm, hung two
pouches, both iiiticle of goafs skin
too; in one of which hung my powder,
in the other iny shot. At my back 1
ranied my basket, and on my shoul-
der my gun; and over my bead a great
clumpy ugly goat's skin umbrella, but
which, after all, was the most neces-
sary thing I had about mo, next to my
gun, As for my face, the colour of it
was really not so mulatto-like, as one
might expect from a man not at all
careful of it, and living within nine or
ten decrees of the equinox. My beard
1 had once suffered to grow till it was
about a quarter of a yard long; but as
J had both soissars and razors suf-
ficient, 1 had cut it pretty short, except
what grew on my upper lip, which 1
had trimmed into a large pair of Maho-
metan whiskers, such as I had seen
worn by some Turks at Sallee; for the
Moors did not wear such, though the
Turks did: of these iiuistaebios or
whiskers, I will not say they were long
enough to hang my hat upon them,
but they were, of a length and shape
monstrous enough, and such as in
Kaglnnd, would have passed for fright-
ful'.
But all this U by the bye; for, as to
my figure, 1 had so few to observe, me,
that it was of no manner of conse-
quence; so 1 say no more to that par!,
in this kind of figure 1 ucnt my new
journey, and was out five or six clays.
1 travelled first along the pea-shore, di-
rectly to the place where 1 first brought
iny boat to aa anchor, to get upon the
rocks; and having no boat now to take
care of, I went over the land, a nearer
way, to the same height that I was upon
before; when looking forward to the
point of the rocks which lay out, and
which ! was obliged to double with my
boat, as is said above, I wu* surprised to
seethe sea all smooth and quiet; no rip-
pling, no motion, no current, any more
there than in any other places. 1 was at
a strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to speed some time in the ob-
serving it, to see if nothing from the
sets of the tide had occasioned it; but 1
was presently convinced how it was,
viz, that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of
waters from some "great river on the
 
shore, must be the occasion of tlib
current; and that according as the wind
blew more forcibly from the west,, or
from the. north, this current cuute
nearer, or went farther from the shore;
for waiting thereabouts till evening, I
went up to the rock again, and then the
title of ebb being made, I plainly Haw
the current again its before, only that
it ran farther .*if, being- near half »
league from ihe shore; whereas, in
my case, it set close upon t';e shore,
and hurried me and my canoe along
with it, which, at another time, it would
not haw; done.
This observation convinced me, that
I had nothing to do but to observe the
ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and
! might very easily bring my boat
about the island again: but when I
began to think of putting it in practice,
1 had such a terror upon iny spirits at
the remembrance of the danger 1 hail
been in, that I could not think of it
again with any patience; but, on the*
contrary, 1 took up another resolution,
which was more safe, though more la-
borious; and this was, that I would
build, or rai.Ij.ef make, me nuothcr pe*
riagua or canoe; and so have one for
otte side of the island, and one for the
other.
You are to understand, that 'novrf:
had, m I in ay call it, two plantation*, lit
the island; one, my little fortification.
or tent, with the wall about it," under
the rock, with the cave behind m% 
which, by this time, 1 had enlarged
into several apartments or eaves, one'
within another. One of these, which
was the driest and largest, and had
a door out: beyond my wall or for-
tification, that is to say* beyond where
my wall joined to the rock, was alt
filled up with the large eartheru pots, of
which 1 have, given an account, and
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets,
which would hold iiva or six bushels
each, where I laid up my stores of pro-
vision, especially my corn, some in the
ear, cut off short from the straw,,aiid
the other rubbed out with my hand.
As for my wall, made, as before, with
long stakes or piles, these, piles grew
ail like trees, aad were by this time,
grown 00 big, and spread so very much,
that there was not thclea*t appearance.

ADVfiNTURKS OF
 
to any one's flew, of iciy habitation be-
hind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a
little farther within the land, and upon
lower ground, lav my two pieces of
corn laud, which 1 kept duly cultivated
and sowed, and which duly yielded me
their harvest in its season: and when-
ever I had occasion for more corn, 1
had more land adjoining as it as that.
Besides this, 1 had my country seal;
and 1 had now it tolerable plantation
there also: for, first, I had my little
bower, as I called it, which I kept in
repair; that is to say, 1 kept the hedge
which encircled it in, constantly fitted up
to its usual height, the bidder standing
always in the inside: 1 kept the trees
which at first were no more than my
stakes, but were now grown very firm
and tail, always cut so that they might
spread, and grow thick and wild, and
make the more agreeable shade; which
they did effectually to my mind. In
the middle of this I had my tent al-
ways standing, being a piece of a sail
spread over poles, set up for that pur-
pose, and which never wanted any re-
pair or renewing; and under this 1 had
made me a squab or couch, with the
skins of the creatures I had killed, and
with other soft things; and a blanket
laid on them, such as belonged to our
sea-bedding, which 1 had saved, and
a great watch-coat to cover me; and
here, whenever 1 had occasion to be
absent from my chief seat, I took up
my country habitation.
Adjoining to this 1 had my enclo-
sures for my cattle, that is to say, my
goats; and as ! had taken an incon-
ceivable deal of pains to fence and en-
close this ground, 1 was so anxious to
see it kept entire, lest the goats show Id
breakthrough, that I never left off; till,
with infinite labour, 1 bad stuck the
outside of the hedge so full of small
stakes, and  so near to one t another,
that it was rather a pale than a hedge,
and there was scarce room to put a band
through between them; which after-
wards, when those stakes grew, as they
all ;dtd hi'the next rainy season, made
the enclosure strong like a wail,—in-
deed* stronger than'any wall.
TOs Wilt testify for me that I was
sot hHe^'fnd :tfcat I spared' no pains
to bring to pass whatever appeared ne-
cessary for my comfortable support;
for 1 considered the keeping up a breed
of tame creatures thus at my hand
would be a living magazine of flesh,
milk, butter, and cheese for me as
long as 1 lived in the place if it wem Ur
be forty years; and that keeping them
in my reach depended entirely upon
my perfecting my enclosures to such
a degree, that 1 might be sure of keep-
ing "thetn together; which, by this
method, indeed, I so effectually secured,
that when these little stakes began to
grow, 1 had planted them so very thick,
that I was forced to pull some of the in
up again.
In this place also 1 lud my grapes
growing, which 1 principally depended
on for my winter store of raisins, and
which I never failed to preserve very
carefully, as the best and most agree-
able dainty of my whole diet: and, in-
deed, they were not only agreeable, but
medicinal, wholesome, nourishing, and
refreshing to the last degree.
As this was also about half-way be-
tween my other habitation and the place
where 1 had laid up my boat, 1 gene-
rally stayed and lay here in my way
thither; for 1 used frequently to visit
my boat; and 1 kept all things about,
or belonging to her, in very good or-
der: sometimes 1 went out in her to
divert myself, but no more hazardous
voyages would 1 go, nor scarce ever
above a stone's cast or two from the
shore, 1 was so apprehensive of being
hurried out of my knowledge again by
the currents or winds, or any other ac-
cident. But now 1 come to a new scene
of my life.
It * "happened "one day, about noon,
going towards my boat* 1 was exceed-
ingly "surprised with the print of a
man's naked foot on the shore, which
was very plain to be seen in the sand.
I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if
1 had seen an apparition; 1 listened, 1
looked rounci me, -but 1 could hear no-
thing, nor see any thing; I went up to
a rising ground, to look further; 1 went
up the shore and down the shore, but
it was all one: 1 could see no other
impression but that one. 1 went to it
again to see if there were any more;
and to observe if it might not be my
 
 
fancy; but there was no room for that,
for there was exactly the print, of a
foot, toes, heel, and every part of a
foot: how it came thither I knew not,
nor could f In the least imagine; but,
after innumerable fluttering thoughts*,
like a man perfectly confused and out
of myself, I came home to my fortifi-
cation, not feeling, us we say, the
ground 1 went on, but terrified to flic
hist degree: looking* behind nie at every
two or three steps, mi.«takingcvery bush
and tree, and fancying every stump at
a distance to be a man. Km' is it pos-
sible to describe bow many various
shaped my affrighted imagination re-
presented thing's to me inf how many
wild ideas were found every moment in
iiiy fancy, and what strange Hnaccount-
able whimsies came into iny thoughts
by the way.
When I came to my castle (for so 1
think I called it ever after this), 1 lied
into it like one pursued; whether I
went over by the ladder, as first con-
trived, or went in at the hole in the
rock, which 1 had called a door, I
cannot remember; no, nor could I
remember the next morning; for
never frightened bare fled to cover, or
fox* to earth, with more terror of mind
than 1 to this retreat
1 slept none that night; the farther
1 was from the occasion of my fright,
the greater my apprehensions were;
which is something' contrary to the
nature of such things, and especially
to the usual practice of all creatures
in fear; but ! was so embarrassed with
my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that! formed nothing but dismal ima-
ginations to myself, even though 1 was
now a great way off* it. Sometimes 1
fancied it must' be the devil, and rea*
son joined in w;th me upon this suppo-
sition; for how should any other thing
inhuman shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought
them? What marks were there of any
other footsteps? And how was it pos-
sible a man should come there? But
then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a
place, where there could be no manner
of^ occasion for it, but to leave the
print of his foot behind him, and that
even for no ptirp^se too, for lie could
not be sure 1 should see it,—this was
an amusement the other way. I con.
side red that the devil might have
found out abundance of other ways to
have terrified me than this of the single
print of a foot: that at* J lived <|iiitc
on the other side of the island, he
would never have been so simple us to
leave a mark in a place where if was
ten thousand to one whether 1 should
ever see it or not, and in the sand too,
which the first surge of the sea, upon
a high wind, would have; defaced en-
tirely: all this seemed inconsistent
with the thing itself, and with all the
notions we usually entertain of the
subtlety of the devil
Abundance of such things as these
assisted to argue me out of all appro*
hensions of its being the devil; and 1
presently concluded then, that it niii.it
he some more dangerous creature,
viz. that it must: be sonic of the sa*
vages of the main land over-agaiust
me, who had wandered out to sea in
their canoes, and either driven by the
currents or by contrary winds,, had
made the island, and had been on
shore, but were gone away again to
sea; being as loth, perhaps, to have
stayed in t.Jiis desolate island as I
wouldJiave been to have had them.
While these reflections were rolling
upon iny mind, I was very thankful
in my thoughts that 1 was so happy as
not to be thereabouts at that time, or
that they did not see my boat, by
which they would have concluded that
mmm inhabitants had been in the
place, and perhaps have searched
farther for me: then terrible thoughts
racked ray imagination about their
haung found my boat, and that there
were people here; and that if so, I
should certainly have them come again
in greater numbers, and devour me j
that if it should happen so that they
should not find me, yet they woalj
find my enclosure, destroy all my
corn, and carry away all my lock of
tame goats, anrf I should perish at Jail
for mere want.
Thus my fear banished all my re-
ligious hope, all that former confidence
in God, which was founded upon such
wonderful experience as I had had'of
his goodness, as if lie that had hi me

boat? Agaiu, I consldefetl also, that 1
could bv no means tell, for certain,
wliere I ImmI trod, and where I bad not;
and that it*, at last, this was only the print
oi my own foot, 1 had played the purt
ctf those fools who try to make stories
of spectres aud apparitions, and then are
frightened at them more than any hody.
N-ow 1 began to lake courage, and
to peep abroad again, for 1 had not
stirred out of my castle for three days
and nights, so that 1 began to starve
for provisions; for 1 had little or no-
thing within doors but some barley-
cakes and water: then I knew that my
goats wanted to he milked too, which
usually was my evening diversion j and
the poor creatures were in great pain
and inconvenience for want of if; and,
indeed, it almost spoiled some of them,
and almost dried up their milk. Encou-
raging myself, therefore, with the be-
lief that this was nothing hut the print
of fine of my own feet, and that 1
might he truly said to start at my own
shadow, 1 began to go abroad again,
and went to my country-house to milk
my, flock; hnt too see with what fear
1 went forward, how often 1 looked
behind me, how I was ready, every now
and then, to lay down my basket, and
run for my lite, it would have made
any one thought 1 was haunted with
an evil conscience, or that 1 had been
lately most terribly frightened; and
so, indeed, 1 had. However, as 1 went
clown thus two or three clays, and
having seen nothing, f begun to be a
little polder* and to think there was
really nothing in it both my own ima-
gination; but 1 could not persuade my-
self fully of this till I should go down
to the shore again, and see this print
of a foot, aad measure it by my own,
and see if there was any similitude or
fitness, that 1 might be assured it was
my own foot; hut when 1 came to the
place* first, it appeared evidently to
roe, .that when 1 laid up ray boat, I
could not possibly be on shore any
wh$re thereabout: secondly, when 1
came to measure the mart with my
own foot, I found my foot uot so large
by a great deal. 'Both thege things
if led oiy head, with new. imaginations,
and gave me the vapours again to the
Iiigheit degree, so that 1 ihook with
cold like one in an ague; anil 1 went 
home again, filled with the belief that
some man or men had been on shore-
there; or, in short, that the bland was
inhabited, and I might be surprised be-
fore 1 was aware; and what course to
take for my security 1 knew not,
O what ridiculous resolutions men
take when possessed with fear! It de-
prives them of the use of those means
which reason offers for their relief
The first thing 1 proposed lei myself
was, to throw down my enclosures,
and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, lest the enemy should find
them, and then frequent* the island in
prospect of the same or the like booty:
then to the simple thing of digging tip
ray two corn fields, lest; they should
find such a grain there, and still be
prompted to frequent the island; then
to demolish my bower and tent, that'
they might not see any vestiges of ha-
bitationi and be prompted to look fur-
ther, in order to find out the persons
inhabiting.
^ These'were the subject of the first
night's cogitations after 1 was come
home again, while the apprehensions
which had. so overrun my mind were
fresh upon me, and my head was full of
vapours, as above, Thus fear of dan-
ger is ten thousand times more terri-
fying than danger itself, when apparent
to tlie eyes; and we find the burthen
of anxiety greater, by much, than the
evil which we are anxious about: and,
which was worse than all this, 1 had
not that relief in this trouble from the
resignation 1 used to practise, that 1
hoped to have, I looked, I thought,
like Saul, who completed not only
that the Philistine? were upon him, but
that God had forsaken him; for'I did
not now take due ways to compose my
mind, by crying to God in my distress;
and resting upon his providence, as 1
had done before, for my defence and
deliverance ;• which, if I had done, 1
had at least been more cheerfully sup-
ported under this new surprise, and
perhaps carried through it with more
resolution.
This confusion of my thoughts kepi
me awake all night; but la.tie metric
big I fell asleep; and having,. by4he
smuiemeat of my mind, hmn, m it

were, ilrtir and my spirits exhausted,
I'slept very soundly, and waled much
better composed than 1 shad ever been
before. And now 1 began to think
stately; and, upon the utmost debate
with myself, I concluded that this is-
land, which" was so exceedingly plea-
sant, fruitful,, and no farther from the
main land than as 1 had seen, was not
so entirely abandoned as 1 might itna*
fine; that although there were no stated
inhabitants who iked on the spot, yet
that there might sometimes come boats
off from the shore, who, either with de-
sign, or ^perhaps never but when they
were driven by cross winds, might
come to this place j that 1 had lived
here fifteen years now, and had not met
with the least shadow or figure of any
people yet; and that if at any time
they should be driven here, it was pro-
bable they went away again as soon as
ever they could, seeing they had never
thought it to fix here upon any occa-
sion; that the most I could suggest
ajrjr danger from, was from any casual
accidental landing of straggling people
from the main, who, as it was likely, if
they were driven hither, were here
against their wills, so they made no
stay here,, but went off again with all
possible speed; seldom staying one
night on shore, lest they should not
have the-help of the tides and clay-light
back-Again; and that, therefore, I had
nothing to do> but to consider of some
safe retreat, in case 1 should see any
say ages laud upon the spot.
Mow 1 began sorely to repent that I
had dug my cave so large as to bring a
door through again, which door, as  I
slid,, eomeout, beyond where my forti-
fication joined to the roek: upon ma-
turely considering this, therefore, 1
fesol?ed to draw me a second fortiiea-
tiou, hi' the same manner of a' semi-
circle, at a distance from my wall, just
where J had planted a double row1 -of
trqes, about "twelve years before, of
which.,I' tuaie mention.: these trees
having been planted so thick .before,
they, wanted but few piles to be driven
between them, that they might be,
-thicker, and, stronger, and, nay • wall
wtouM be soon,.finished; so -that,I.bad
m$$ % double wall -r, and my outer wall
wat; thickened. witf* _ pieces of ti m h »-• r.
 
old cables, and every thing 1 collcl
think of, to make it strong; having m
it seven little holes, about as big as 1
might put my arm out at. In the  in-
side of this, I thickened my wall to
about ten feet thick, with continually-'
bringing earth out of my cave, and lay-
ing it at the foot of the wall, and walk*
ing upon it; and through the seven
holes 1 contrived to plant the muskets,
of which I took notice that I had got
seven on shore out of the ship -9 these 1
planted like my cannon, and fitted them
into frames, that held them like a car-
riage, so that I could ire all the seven
guns in two minutes time: this wall I
was many a weary month in finishing,
and yet never thought myself safe till
it was done.
When this was done, 1 stuck all the
ground without my wall, for a great
length every way, as full with stakes, or
sticks, of the osier-like wood, which I
found so apt to grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch, that I believe I might
set in near twenty thousandof them,lea?-
ing a pretty large space between them
and my wall, that 1 might have room to
see an enemy, and they might have no1
shelter from* the young trees, if, they
attempted to approach my outer wall.
Thus, in two years' time, I had a
thick grove; and* in five or six years'
time 1 had a wood before my dwelling,
growing so monstrous thick and strong,
that it was indeed perfectly impassa-
ble; and no men, of what kind soever,
would ever imagine that there was any
thing beyond it, much less a habita-
tion. As for the way which 1 proposed
to myself to go in and out (for I left n©
avenue), it was by setting two ladders,
one to a part of the rock which was
low, and then broke in, and left room
to plaee another ladder upon that;- ao
when the two ladders -were taken down,'
no man living.could come down to He
without doing himself mischief; aid if
they had- come down, they were still
on i the outside of my outer wall.
Thus I,took all the measures human
prudence could suggest for my own.
preservation; and it will be seen," at
length, that ;hey were not altogether
without Just reason; though 1 foresaw 
nothing at that time more thati :tny-
mere fear suggested to me*, - .  
 
 
.«*
 
 
- While this was doings I was not
altogether careless of my other affairs;
for I liwi tt' great concern upon me for
my little herd of frosts; they were not
oiiiy a ready supply to me on every
occasion, and began to be sufficient for
me, witiiottt the expense of powder
ami shot, but also without the fatigue
of hunting after the wild ones; and I
wai loth to Imt the advantage of them,
and to have them all to nurse up over
again.
For this purpose, after long consi-
deration, I eould think of but two ways
to preserve them: one was, to find
another convenient place to dig a cave
under ground, and to drive tliem into
il every night; and the other was, to
enclose two or three little bits of land,
remote from one another, ami as much
concealed as I could, where 1 might
keep about half a dozen young goats in
each place; so that if any disaster hap-
pened to the flock in general, I might
be able to raise them" again with little
trouble and time: and this, though it
would require a great deal of time and
labour, I thought was lite most rational
design.
Accordingly, 1 spent some time to
find out the most retired parts of the
island; and I pitched upon one, which
was m private, indeed, as my heart
could wish for; it was a little damp
pec© of ground, in the middle of the
hollow arid thick woods, where, as is
observed, 1 almost lost myself once
before, endeavouring to come back that
way front the eastern part of the is-
land. Here 1 found a clear piece of
land, near three acres, so surrounded
with woods, that it was almost an
enclosure by nature; at feast, it did
not want near so much labour to make
it so as the other pieces of ground I
had worked so bird at,
I immediately went to work with this
piece of ground, aid in less than a
month's time 1 hail so fenced it round,'
that my Hock or herd, call it which yon
ptetae, who 'were not so wild now as at
first they might be supposed to be,
w«re:well enough secured in It: so,
without any further delay, 1 removed
ttn yo«g she-goats and two h€-goats
to this piei»e; 'and when they were
ttane,I cottthMtedloperfemhtf-foiee,
till f had ntade it* as mmre us"tie
other; which, howevtir, 1 did it 'more
leisure, ami it took me up mote time by
a great deal'. All this fabdur I %m it
the expenee of, purelt from toy dnpre*
hensions on the aectfurit of the print of
a mail's foot which 1 had' seen'; for, ii'
yet, I never saw any human creaturo
come near the island; arict I had nmy
lived two years under this uneasiness,
which, indeed, made my life much less
comfortable than it was before, as may
be well imagined by any one who
knows what it is to live in the constant
snare of the fear of man. And this I
must observe, with grief too, that the
discomposure of my mind had too
great impressions also upon the religi-
ons part of my thoughts: for the dread
and terror of falling into the hands of
savages and cannibals lay so upon my
spirit*, that I seldom found myself in A*
due temper for application to my Ma-
ker, at least not with the sedate catm-
ne«s and resignation of soul which 1
was wont to "do j ! rather prayed to*
God as under great affliction and pres-
sure of mind, surrounded with imigut,
and in expectation every night of being
murdered and devoured before morn-
ing; and I must testify from my expe-
rience, that a temper of peace, thank*
fulness, love, and affection, is touch the
more proper frame for prayer than that
of terror and discomposure; and that'
under the; dread of mischief impending,
a man Is no more It for a comforting
performance of the duty of praying' W
God, than he Is for a repentance on a
sick lied; for these discomposure's'
affect the mind, as the others do tft«
body*, and the discomposure of the
mina must necessarily f*e tt  great «
disability as that of the body, mtd
much greater j praying to dm being'
properly an act of the mind, not'of the*
body.
But to''go on: after I had thus se-
cured' one part'of my little living' stock,
1 'went about the whole island, search-
ing for another prifatc place to mak'O'
such another depoiil-, when, wander*
ing more to the west point of the island?;
then 1 bad ever1 done yet, and loollrig""

ADVENTURES OF
of the seamen's chests, which I saved
out of our ship, hut I had it not about
me; and this was so remote, that 1
conIcl not teil  what to make of it;
though I looked at it till my eyes were
not able to hold to look any longer;
whether it was a boat or not 1 do not
know, but as I descended from the hill
1 could see no more of it; so I gave it
over;' only I resolved to go no more
out without a perspective-glass in my
pocket. When I was come down the
hill to the end of the Island, where, in-
deed, I had never been before, 1 was
presently convinced that the seeing the
print of a man's foot was not such a
strange thing in the island as I ima-
gined: and, but that it was a special
providence that I was east upon the
side of the island where the savages
never came, I should easily have known
that nothing was more frequent than
for the canoes from the main, when
they happened to be a little too far
out at sea, to shoot over to that side
of the island for harbour: likewise, as
they often met and fought in their ca-
noes, the victors, having taken any pri-
soners, would bring them over to this
shore, where, according to their dreadful
customs, being all cannibals, they would
Mil and eat them; of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to
the shore, us I said above, being the
S. W. point of the island, ! was per-
fectly confounded and amazed; nor is
it possible for me to express the horror
of my mind, at seeing the shore spread
with- skulls, hands, feet, and other
bones of human bodies $ and, particu«
lariy,' I observed a place where there
'had been a ire made, and a circle dug
in the earth, like a cock-pit, where I
supposed the- aavage wretches -had sat
down to their inhuman feastings upon
the bodies of their fellow-creatures.
: I was so astonished with the sight of
these things, that 1 entertained no no-
tions of  any 'chtitger<£o myself from it.
for a long while i all my apprehensions
were buried in the thoughts of such a
pitch :of Inhuman, hellish brutality, and
",tk6'horror of the degeneracy of human'
nature,"which, though' I 'had heard of
it:'aften»yet 1 never, had so near-a view
Of lefore i In shotf# I turned away my
flee'from fM horrid" .spectacle;' my
 
stomach grew sick, and 1 was-just on
the point of fainting, when nature dis-
charged the disorder from my stomach 5
and having vomited with uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but
could not bear to stay in the place a
moment; so I got me up the hill again
with all the speed 1 could, and walked
on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part
of the island, 1 stood still awhile, as
amazed, and then recovering myself,
I looked up with the utmost affec-
tion of my soul, and, with a food of
tears in my eyes, gave God thanks,
that had cast my first lot in a part of
the world where 1 was distinguished
from such dreadful creatures as these;
and that, though 1 had esteemed my
present condition very miserable, had
yet given me so many comforts in it,
that 1 had still more to give thanks
for than to complain of: and this,
above all, that 1 had, even in this mise-
rable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of Himself, and the
hope of His blessing; which was a feli-
city more than sufficiently equivalent
to all the misery which I had suffered,
or could suffer.
In this frame of thankfulness, 1 went
home to my castle, and began to be
much easier now, as to the safety of
my circumstances, than ever f 'was
before: for 1 observed that these
wretches never came to this island in
search of what they could get; perhaps
not seeking, not wanting, or not ex-
pecting, 'any thing here; and having
often, no doubt, been up in the covered,
woody part of it, without finding any
thing to their purpose, I knew I had
been here now almost eighteen years,
and never saw the least footsteps of
human creature there before; and I
might be eighteen years more as
entirely concealed as I was now, if I
did not discover myself to them, which
1 had no manner of occasion to '-do; it
being my only business to keep myself
entirely concealed where ! was, unless
1 found a'better sort of creatures than
cannibals to make myself known to.
Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of
the savage wretches that I have been
speaking'of, and of the wretched inhu-
man custom of their devouring and eat-
 
 
 
ing one another up, that i continued
pensive titicl sad, and kept close within
my own circle, for almost two years
after this; when I mj my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz.
my castle* my country-seat, which 1
called my bower, and my enclosure in
the wood's; nor I did look after this for
any other use than as an enclosure for
my goats; for the aversion which na-
ture'gave me to these hellish wretches
was such, that 1 was us fearful of seeing
them as of seeing the Devil himself. I did
not so much as goto look after my boat
all this time, but began rather to think
of making me another; for I could not
think of ever making any more attempts
to bring' the other boat round the island
to me, lest 1 should meet with some of
these creatures at sea; in which if I
had happened to have fallen into their
hands, 1 knew what would have been
my lot.
Time, however, arid the satisfaction
1 had that 1 was in no danger of being*
discovered by these people, began to
wear off* my uneasiness about them;
and 1 began to live just in the same
composed manner as before ; only with
this difference, that I used more cau-
tion, and kept my eyes more about me,
than 1 did before, lest i should happen
to lie seen by any of them; and parti-
cularly, I was more cautious of firing
my gun, lest any of them being on the
island should happen to hear it. It
was therefore a very good providence
to me that 1 had furnished myself with
a tame breed of goats, and that 1 had
no need to hunt any more about the
woods, or shoot at tliem; and if 1 did
catch any of them after this, it was by
traps and snares, a* 1 had done before:
so that for two years after this, J be-
lieve I never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it;
and, which was more, as 1 had saved
three pistols out of the ship, 1 always
carried them out with me, or at least
two of them, sticking them in my
goat's-skin belt. 1 also furbished up
one of the great cutlasses that I had
out of the ship, and made me a belt to
hang -it on also j so that I was now a
most formidable fellow to look at when
1 went abroad, if you add to the for- -
titer description of myself, the particu-
lar of two pistols, and a great broad-
sword hanging at my side in a belt, but
without a scabbard*
Things going on thus, as I have said,
for .some time, 1 seemed, excepting
these cautions, to be reduced to wy
former calm sedate way of living. All
these things tended to show me, more
and more, how far my condition wm
from being miserable, compared to
some others ; nay, to many other par-
ticulars of life, which it might have
pleased God to have made my lot. It
put me upon reflecting how little re-
pining there would be among mankind
at any condition of life, if people would
rather compare their condition with
tho;?e that were worse, in order to be
thankful, than be always comparing
them with those which arc better, to as-
sist their murmurings and complainings.
As in my present condition there
were not really many things which I
wanted, so indeed, I thought that the
frights 1 had been in about these
savage wretches, and the concern 1 had
been in for my own preservation, had
taken off the hedge of my invention for
my own conveniences j and 1 bad
dropped a good design, which 1 had
once bent my thoughts too much upon,
and that was, to try if I could not make
some of my barley into malt, and then
try to brew myself some beer. , This
was really a whimsical thought, and 1
reproved myself often for the simplicity
of it; for 1 presently saw there would
be the want of several things neces-
sary to the making my beer, that it
would be impossible for me to supply:
as first, casks to preserve it in, which
was a thing that, as 1 have observed
already, I 'could never compass j no
though 1 spent not only many days,
but weeks, nay months, in attempting
it, but to no purpose. In, the next
place, 1 had no hops to make it keep,
no yeast to make it work, no copper
or 'kettle, to make it boil; and ;yet,
with all these things wanting, .1 verily
believe, had not the fright* and terrors
1 wm in about the savages inter veiled,
1 had undertaken it, and, perhaps
brought it to pass too; for 1 seldom
gave any thing over without accom-
plishing  it/ when once 1 had it in my
Mead to begin it* • But my invention

ADVENTURES Of
 
ii0i? rm qwiie another way j for night
aw} day, 1 coukt think of nothing but
how: 1 might destroy some of these
monsters i$i their cruel, bloody enter-
tai&ment, and if possible, sa?e the
victim' they should bring hither to
destroy. It would take up a larger
volume than this whole' work Is intend"
cd to be, to set down all the contri-
vances I hatched, or rather brooded
upon, in my thoughts, for the destroy-
iu| these creatures, or at least fright-
ening them so as to prevent their com*
lug hither any more: but ail this was
abortive; nothing could be possible
to take effect, unless 1 was to be there
to do it myself: and what could ope
in&n do among them, when perhaps
there might be twenty or thirty of them
together, with their darts,"or their
bows and arrows, with which they
could' shoot 'as true to a mark a? I
could with my gun?
Sometimes' 1 thought of digging a
)iple-under the place where they made
their fire, and putting In five or six
pounds  of' gunpowder, which, when
they kincpea their ire, would conse-
quently take' ftre, and blow up all that
was near it: but as, In the first place,
1 should'be unwilling to waste so much
poWder upon them, my store being
now within the quantity of one barrel,
go ijellhcf could I be sure of its going
off, at any certain time, when it might
surprise them $ and at best, that it
would do little more than just blow
the  lire about their ears,' and fright
them, but not sufficient to make them
fopi|jce.tbe' plsee:' so 1 laid it aside;
and* then proposed^ that I would place
myself In amotipb In some, convenient
place, with my three guns all double-
loaded, and'in the middle of their bloody
ceremony, let' fly at them,, when 1
should be sure to' Mil or wound per-
haps two or three at every shot;' and
then falling'in upon them with my
three pistol** and my sword, 1 made no
doobf hut that if there were twenty I
should kill them all This fancy pleas-
ed my thoughts for some weeks; and
I was so- full of it, that 1 often' dream-
ed of it, and sometimes thai I was just
going to: let i% at" tiiem in my sleep. '1
•wiii r-i) far M-ith it in my i'mngmjitiiin,
vh«t I employed m\*Hf several da\*
to find out proper places to pit intsetf
in ambuscade, as 1 said, to watcn for
them, and I went frequently to the
place itself, which was, now grown
more familiar to me? but while py
niind was thus filled with thoughts of
revenge, and a bloody putting twenty
or thirty of them to the sword, as 1
may call it, the horror I had at the
place, and at the signals of the bar-
barous wretches devouring one ano-
ther, abetted my malice. Well at
length, 1 found a place in the side
of the hill, were 1 was satisfied 1
might securely wait till 1 saw any of
their boats coming; and might then,
even before they would be ready to
come on sbore, convey myself, un-
seen, into some thickets of trees,
in one of which there was a hollow
large enough to conceal me entirely:
and there 1 might sit and observe all
their bloody doings, and take my full
aim at their heads, when they were
so close together m that it would be
next to impossible that I should miss
my shot, or that I could fail wound-
ing three or four of them at the first
shot. In this place, then, 1 resolved
to fix my design ; and accordingly, 1
prepared two muskets and my ordi-
nary fowling-piece. The two muskets
I loaded with a brace of slugs each,
and four or five smaller bullets,, about
the size of pistol-bullets; and the
fowling-piece I loaded with near a
handful of swan-shot, of the largest
size: I also loaded my pistols with
about four bullets each; and in this
posture, well provided with am muni-
tion for a second and third charge, 1 •
prepared myself for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme of
my design, and in my imagination, put
it in practice, 1 continually made my
tour every morning tip to the top olf
the hill, which was . from my castle, #s
1 called it, about three mile's,, or more,
to see if I could; observe any boats
upon the sea, coming near the island
or standing over towards it: but 1
began to tire of this hard duty, after 1
had, for tw# or three months, constant-
ly kept my watch,, but came always
back without any discovery; there
living not, in all* that time, been the
least'app4jtyra&i% not only-09;or t#§f *
sr
 
tlit shore, but.ou the whole ocean, $p
far as my eyes or glasses could, reach
every way.,
As long, as ! kept ray daily tour to
the hill to look out, so king also. I kepi
up the vigour of my design, and my
spirits seemed to lie all the while in a
suitable form for so outrageous an
execution as the killing twenty or thirty
nuked savages, for an offence which I
had not at all, entered into a discussion
of in my thoughts, any farther than my
passions were at first tired hy the hor-
ror 1 conceived at the unnatural cus-
tom of the people of that country $
who, it seems, had been suffered hy
Providence, in his wise disposition of
the world, to have no other guide than
that of their own abominable and vi-
tiated passions; and, consequently,
were left, and perhaps had been so for
some ages, to act such horrid things,
and receive such dreadful customs, as
nothing hut nature, entirely abandoned
by Heaven, and actuated by some hel-
lish degeneracy, could have run them
into. But now, when, as f have said,
I began to be weary of the fruitless
excursion which 1 had made so long
and so far every morning in vain, m
iny opinion of the action itself began
to alter; and I began, with cooler and
calmer thoughts, to consider what 1
was, going to engage in j what autho-
rity or call 1 had to pretend to be
judge and executioner upon these men
as criminals, whom Heaven had thought
fit,, for so many ages, to suffer, unpu-
nished, to go on, and to be as it were,
the executioners of his judgments one
upon another. How far these people
were offenders against me, and what
right 1 had to engage in the quarrel of
that; blood which they shed promiscu-
ously upon one another, 1 debated this
very often with myself, thus: How do
I know what God himself judges in this
particular ease > It is certain these'
people do,not commit this as a crime;
it is not against their own consciences,
reproving, or their light reproaching
them 5 they do not know it to be m:
offence, and they commit it in deiaace
of divine justice, as we do in almost all
the sins we commit., They think it no
more a crime to kill a captive taken, p,,
war,, than we cte to kill an ox* uqjrta •
eat human ie&li* than we. do to' em
mutton. . , ., ;.. „
When 1 considered this a little, it fofc»
lowed necessarily that 1 waa .certainly in
the wrong in it$ that these people were
not murderers in the $eu$e that 1 had Ins-
fore condemned them in my  thought!
any more than those Chri#iiumt wene
murderers who often put to death the
prisoners taken in battle; or more fro*
quently upon many occasions put whole
troops of mcntotheswoid, without giv-
ing quarter, though they threw down,
their arms and submitted. In the next
place, it occurred to me, that although'
the usage they gave one another wai
thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was
really nothing to me 5 these people had-
done me no injury: that if they attempt-
ed me, or i saw it necessary, for wiy im»
mediate prcservation,to fail upon tnem>-
something might be said for it; but
that 1 was yet out of their power,- and
they really had no knowledge of wie 1 and
consequently no design upon rne; and 
therefore it could not be just lor me to-
fall upon them: that this would justify
the conduct of the Spaniards in ail their
barbarities practised in America, where
they destroyed millions of these people:
who, however they were idolaters and
barbarians, and had several bloody and
barbarous rites in their customs,  such 
as sacrificing humaa frodies to their
idols, ^ were yet, as to the Spaniards,'
very innocent people; and that the
rooting them out of the country is

and detestation by even- the Spaniard*.  •

offHmy design, and to ''conclude 1 had
taken, wrong mew-ares in my resolution
to. attack"the savages; and that it was
not .my business- to meddle with them,
unless they first attacked me; and this
it' was toy business, if possible, to pre-
vent | but that if 1 were discovered and
attacked -by them, I knew my duty.
On the other hand, 1 argued with my-
self, that this really was the way not
to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin
and destroy myself; for unless 1 was
sure to kill every one that not only
should be on shore at that time, but
that should -ever come on shore after-
wards, if but one of them escaped to
tell their country-people what had hap-
pened, they would come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their
fellows, and 1 should only bring upon
myself« certain destruction, which, at
present, !had do manner of occasion
for. Upon the whole, 1 concluded,
that neither in principle nor in policy
1 ought, one way or other, to concern
myself in this affair: that my business
was, by all possible means, to conceal
myself from them, and not to leave the
least signal to them to guess by, that
there were any living creatures upon
- the island, 1 mean of human shape.
Religion joined in with this prudential
< resolution; and i was convinced now,
many ways, that 1 was perfectly out of
my 'duty when 1 was laying all my
bloody schemes for the destruction of
innocent Creatures; I mean innocent as
to - me. As to the crimes they were
guilty of towards one another, 1 had
nothing to do with them; they were
national, and 1 ought to leave them to
the justice of God, who is the governor
of nations, and knows how, by national
punishments, to make a just retribu-
'tion for national offences, and to bring
• public judgments upon those who of-
fend in a public manner, by such ways
m best please him. This appeared so
- clear to me now, that nothing was a
 -greater, satisfaction to me than that 1
had not been suffered -to do a thing
 which I now saw so much reason to
believe, Avould hate been no less a sin
than that of wilful murder, If I had
, committed it; and I-gave most hum-
;-Hie thanks oa my knees' to God, -that
'. litol ihusdelivereit-me from, blood-guil-
tiness; beseeching him to grant me
the protection of his providence, -that
I might not fall into the hands of the
barbarians, or that I might not lay my
hands upon them, unless-1 had a mom
clear call from heaven to do it, iff
defence of my own life.
In this disposition 1 continued * for
near a year after this; and so far was
1 from desiring an occasion for failing
upon these wretches, that in alt that
time I never once went up the hill to
see whether there were any of them in
sight, or to know whether any of them
had been on shore there or riot, that I
might not be tempted to renew any of
my contrivances against them, or be?
provoked, by any advantage which
might present itself, lo fail upon them r
only this 1 did, I went and removed my
boat, which 1 had on the other side of
the island, and carried if clown to the
east end of the whole island, where f
ran it into a little cove, which I found
under some high rocks, and where I
knew, by reason of the currents, the
savages durst not, at least would not
come, with their boats, upon any ac-
count whatever. With my boat I car-
ried away every thing that 1 had left
there belonging to her, though not ne-
cessary for the bare going thither, viz.
a mast and sail which I had made for
her, and a thing like an anchor, but
which, indeed, could not be called ci-
ther anchor or grapnel; however, it
was the best 1 could make of its kind:
all these I removed, that there might
not be the least shadow of any disco-
very, or any appearance of any boat, or
of any human habitation, upon the is-
land. Besides this, I kept myself, as I
said, more retired than ever, and sel-
dom went from my cell, other than
upon mj constant employment, viz. to
milk my she-goats, and" manage my
little lock in "the wood, which, as it
was quite on the other part of1 the
island, was quite out of danger; 'for
certain it is, that these savage people,
who sometimes haunted this island,
never came with any thoughts of ever
finding any thing here, and conse-
quently never wandered off from the
coast 5 and 1 doubt not but they might
have been several times on shore after
my apprehensions of them hid made
 
 
 
SH
 
me cautious, as well m before. Indeed,
f looked' back with some horror upon
the thoughts of what iity condition
would have been if 1 had chopped
upon thorn and been discovered before
that, when, nuked awl unarmed, ex-
cept with one gun, and that loaded
often only with "smalt shot, I walked
every where, peeping and peering
about the island to see what I could
g*et; what a surprise should 1 have
been in, if, when 1 hud discovered the
print of a man's foot, 1 had, instead of
that, seen fifteen or twenty savages,
and found them pursuing mc, and by
the swiftness of their running, no pos-
sibility of my escaping them? Hie
thoughts of this sometimes sunk my
very soul within me, and distressed my
mind so much, that I could not soon
recover it, to think what I should have
done, and how 1 should not only have
been unable to resist them, but even
should not have had presence of mind
enough to do what J might have done;
much less what now, after so much
consideration and preparation, 1 might
be able to do. Indeed, after serious
thinking' of these things I would be
very melancholy, and sometimes it
would last a great while; but 1 re-
solved it all, at last, into thankfulness
to that Providence which had delivered
me from so many unseen dangers, and
had kept from me those mischiefs
which I could have no way been the
agent in delivering myself from, be-
cause I had not the least notion of any
such thing depending, or the least sup-
position of its being possible. This
renewed a contemplation which often
had come to my thoughts in former
time, when first 1 began to see the
merciful dispositions of Heaven, in
the dangers we run through in this
life; how wonderfully we are delirered
when ivc know nothing of it; how,
when we are in (a quandary, as we call
it) a doubt or hesitation, whether to go
this way, or that way, a secret 'hint
shall direct us this way, when we in-
tended- to go that way; nay, when
sense, our own inclination and*perhaps
business, has called us to go the other
way, yet a strange impression upon
the^mind, from wa know not .what
springs, and by we know not what
power, shall overrule m to gaz-thi*
way; and it shall afterwards appear/'
that had we gone that way which -wiV
should have gone,' and even to^ow
i magi nation ought' to have gone,- we
should have been ruined and lost.'
Upon these, and many dike reflection*/
I afterwards made it a certain' rule
with me, that whenever 1 found tWc
secret hints or pressings of mind, to
doing or not doing any thing that pre-
sented, or going this way or that way,
i never failed to obey the secret dic-
tate; though 1 knew no other reason
for it than that such a pressure, or
such a hint, hung upon my mind. I
could give many examples of the suc-
cess of* this conduct in the course of
my life, but more especially in the
latter part of my inhabiting "this tin-
happy island; besides many occasions
which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of, if 1 had seen with the
same eyes then that I see with now.
But It is never too late to be wise;- and
I cannot but advise all considering men,
whose lives are attended  with such
extraordinary incidents as mine, or
even though not so extraordinary; not
to slight such secret intimations of
Providence, let them come from what
invisible intelligence they will That
I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot
account for; but certainly they arc a
proof of the converse of spirits, -ami
a secret communication between"those
embodied and those unembodied/and
such a proof as can never be  with-
stood; of which 1 shall have occasion
to give some very remarkable instances
in the remainder of my solitary resi-
dence in this dismal place. " 
I believe the reader of this will not
think it strange if ! confess that these
anxieties, these constant "dangers'I
lived in, and the concern that was now
upon me, put an end to all invention,
and to all the contrivance* that 1 had
laid for m? future accommodations
and conveniences. 1 had the care-of
my safety more now upon mj hartds
than that of mj food. • I cared-not' t0
drive a "naif or chop a stick of'wooj
now,-for fear the noise I might make
should die heard; 'much less would j
fire a gun,' for the same'Tefesonvarid

making-any fife, lest the smoke, which
is visible at a great distance in the day
should betray me. For this reason 1
removed that part of my business
which required fire, such as hunting of
poll and'pipes, &e. into my new apart-
ment in the woods.; where* after I had
been spine time, I found, to niy un-
speakable consolation, a mere natural
cave in the earth, which went in a vast
way* and where, I dare say, no §avage»
had he been at the mouth of it, would
be so hard? as to venture in j nor, in-
clee4 would any man eke, hut one
who, }ike.me, wanted nothing so much
as a safe ret Feat.
The .mouth of this hollow, was at
the bottom of a great rock, where hy
mere accident (I would say, if I did
not see abundant reason to ascribe ail
such things,now to Providence), I was
cutting down some thick branches of
trees to make charcoal 5 and before 1
go .on 1 roust observe the reason of my
making this charcoal, which was thus;
1 was afraid of making a smoke about
my habitation, as 1 said before$ and
yet I could not Jive there without bak-
ing my bread, cooking my meat, &c. j
so 1 contrived to burn some wood here,
as I. .had. seen done in England, under
turf, till it became chark, or dry coal:
and then putting the fire out, 1 pre-
served-the coal to carry home and per-
form the other services for which ire
wa# wanting, without danger of smoke.
But this is, by the. by;—While 1 was
cutting thwn some wood here, 1 per-
ceived that behind a very thick branch
of low brush-wood, or under-wood,
there was a kind of hollow . place; 1
was curious to look in it, and getting
with 'difficulty Into the mouth of it, 1
found, it was pretty large; that is to
say, sufficient for me to stand upright
in i|», $nd>-perhaps another with me:
but.I must confess to you that I made
more haste out, than 1 did in, when
looking farther into the place, and
which was^ perfectly dark, l say two
broad shining eyc»\of some creature,
whether Ami or man I; knew not,
which ..twinkled like. tw». ntfursj the

ref^feied-^^If^'.^pii^e^ti, .to mil
myself a thousand fools, and to'think*
that he that was afraid to see the devil
was not it to live twenty years In an
island aU alone; and that 1 might well
think there was nothing in this cave that
was more frightful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took
up a Ire brand, and in 1 rushed again,-
with the stick laming in my band: I
had not gone three steps in, but 1 was
almost as much frightened as J was
before; for 1 beard a very loud sigh,
like that of a man in some  pain, and
it was followed by a broken noise, as
of words half-expressed, and then a
deep sigh again. 1 stepped, back, aad
was indeed struck with such a surprise,
that it put me into a cold sweat; and
if I had had a hat on my head, 1 will
not answer for it, that my hair might
not have lifted it off. But still pluck-
ing up my spirits a*, well m 1 could,
and encouraging myself a little with
considering that the power and pre-
sence of God was every where and
was able to protect me, upon this I
stepped forward again, and by the
light of the firebrand, holding it up a
little over my head, 1 saw lying on the
ground a most monstrous, frightful,
old he-goat, just making his will> as
we say, and gasping for life; and
dying, indeed, of mere old age. I
stirred him a little to see if f could get
him out, and he essayed to get up, hut
was not able to raise himself 5, and I
thought with myself he might even lie
there; for if he had frightened me,
so he would certainly fright any of the
savages, if any of them should be m
hardy as to come in there while he had
,any life in him.
I was now recovered from my sur**
prise, and began to look round me,
when I found the cave was but very
small, that is to say, it might be about
twelve feet over, but in no manner of
shape, neither round nor square, no
hands having ever been, employed in
'.making .it but -those of mere Mature.
1 observed also that there was a plajeg
at the farther side of it that went in
further, but was ao low that it required
me tp creep upon my hands and
knees to go into it, and whither- it.

solved to come again the next clay,
provided willi candles and a tinder-box,
which I had made of the lock of one
of t|» muskets, with some wild-fire in
Um pan.
Accordingly, the next day I came
provided with six large candies of my
own making1 (for I made very good
candles now' of goat's tallow, but was
hard set for caudle-wick, using some-
time* rags or rope-yarn, and sometimes
the dried rind of a"weed like nettles);
and going into this low place, 1 wm
obliged to creep npon all fours, as 1
have said, almost ten yards; which,
by the way, I thought was a venture
bold enough, considering that 1 knew
not how far if might go, nor what was
beyond it. When 1 had got through
the strait, 1 found the roof rose higher
up, i believe near twenty feet 5 lint
never was such a glorious sight seen
in the island, I dare say, as it was, to
look round, the sides and roof of this
vault or cave; the wall reflected m
hundred thousand lights to iue from
my two candles? What it wm in the
rock, whether diamond*, or any other
precious stones, or gold, which 1 rather
supposed it to lie, I knew not. The
plane 1 was in was a moat delightful
cavity or grotto of its kind, as could
be expected, though perfectly dark;
the floor was dry and level, and had a
sort of a smalt loose gravel upon it,
so that there was no nauseous or
venomous creature to be seen, neither
was there any damp or wet on the
sides or roof: the only difficulty in it
was the entrance; which, however, m
it was a place of security, md such
a retreat as I wanted, I thought that
was a convenience; so that 1 was
really rejoiced at the discovery, and
resolved, without any delay* to bring
some of those things which 1 was
most anxious about to this place;
particularly, I resolved to bring hither
my magazine of powder, ana all my
spare arms, viz. two fowling-pieces,
for I.- had three in, all, and- three
wusketi, f©# of the© 1 had eight in
all j so I kept at rav castle only five,
whicfc stood ready-mounted/ like
pieces of cannon, on my outmost
fence ;<• and were ready also to-take out
upojt- 'tffif c,^pfi#j€tt§*' Upo«,#».oec#-
sion of removing' 1m ammunition, I
happened to open the barrel of powder
which I took up out of the sea, awl
which had been wet; and 1 found that
the wafer hud penetrated about three
or four inches into the powder on
every side, which, diking ami growing
harrf, had preserved flic inside like a
kernel in the shell$ m that 1 had n«ir
sixty pounds of very good powder ia
the centre of the cask: this was a very
agreeable discovery to meat that time;
00 I carried all away thither, never
keeping above two or'three pounds of
powder with me in my castle, for fear
of a surprise of any kind: 1 also car*
tied thttner all the lead 1 had left for
bid lets.
i fancied myself now like one of the
ancient giantg, which were said to live
in caves and holes in the roeks, where
none could come at them j for I per-
suaded myself, while 1 was here, that
if live hundred savages were to hunt
me, they could never find me out;.  or,
if they did, they would not venture to
attack me here. The old goat, whom
1 found expiring, died in the mouth of
the cave the next day after I made this
discovery: and 1 found it touch easier
to dig a great hole there, and throw
him in and cover him with earth, than
to drag him out j so 1 interred Mm
there, to prevent offence to nw nose*
1 was now in the twenty4uird year
of my residence in this island; and
was- so naturalised to the place,, and
the manner of living, that could 1
have but enjoyed the certainty tliaf no- 
savages would come to the place to
disturb me, I could have beeu content;
$m have capitulated for spending the
rest of my time there, even to the
last moment, till I had laid me down
and died, like the old goat in the cave..
1 had also arrived to some little diver-
sions and amusements, which made
the time pass a great deal more<piea~'

tiotfcfti in the Brazils that they -lire a
hundred years. 'My dog was a very
pleasant and loving companion to me
"for no km than sixteen years of my
lime, 'and then died of niere old age.
As for my cuts, they multiplied, as 1
have observed, to that degree, that!
'wits obliged to shoot several of them at
first to keep them from devouring me
and all'I liaicl $ hut at length, when the
two old ones I brought with me were
gone, and after some time continually
driving1 them from me, and letting
tliens' have no provision with me, they
mil'Tan wild into the woods, except
two or three favourites, which 1 kept
tame, and whose young, when they
hid any, I always drowned; and these
were part of my family. Besides these,
I always kept two or three household
kids about me, whom 1 taught to feed
out of my hand; and I had two more
parrots, which talked pretty well, and
would all call Robin Crusoe, but none
like my first; nor, indeed did I take
the pains with any of them that I had
'•done with him. 1 had also several
tame 'sea-fowls, whose names I knew
not, that I caught upon the shore, and
cut their wings; and the little stakes
which I had planted before my castle-
wail being now grown up to-a mod
thick' grove, these fowls ail lived
'among these low trees, and bred there,
which was very agreeable to me; so
that, as 1 said above, ! began to be
very well contented with the life I
fed, if 1 could have been secured from
the dread"'of the savages. But it was
'Otherwise directed; and it may not be
amiss 'for all people who shall meet
with' my story, to make this just ob-
servation from it, viz. How frequently
'-in 'the 'course of our lives, the evil
Which in itself we seek most to shun,
 'and which, when we are fallen into, is
 the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes
the 'very means or door of our de-
 liverance, by which alone we can be
'^raised again "from the affliction we are
fallen' into. 1 could give many ex-
amples'<>f this in the course of my'Un-
accountable life; but in nothing was
''It more particularly; remarkable' than
''Intte'Clretimstiiiieei of my last-years
'*6f «olitity:< residence in1 lids'island.
It was now the month of December*
as 1 said above, in my twenty-third
year; and this, being the southern
solstice (for winter I cannot call it),
was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much
abroad in the fields: when going out
pretty early in the morning," even be-
fore it was thorough day-light, I was
surprised with'seeing a light of some
ire upon the shore, at a distance from
me of about two miles, towards the
end of the island where I had ob-
served some savages - had been, as
before, and not on the other side; but,
to my great affliction, it was on my
side o*f the island.
1 was indeed terribly surprised at
the sight, and stopped short within my
grove, not daring to go out, lest I
might be surprised, and yet 1 had no
more peace within, from the appre-
hensions I had that if these savages,
in rambling over the island, should
find my corn standing or cut, or any
of my works and improvements, they
would imtnediatelv conclude that there
were people in the place, and -would
then never give over till they had
found me out. In this extremity, I
went back directly to my castle, pulled
"up the ladder after me, and made all
things without look as wild and na-
tural as 1 could;
Then I prepared myself within, put-
ting myself in a posture of defence: I
loaded all my cannon, as 1 called them,
that is to say, my muskets, which were
mounted upon,my new fortification, and
all my pistols, and resolved to defend
myself to the last gasp; not forgetting
seriously to commend myself to the di-
vine protection, and earnestly to pray
to God to deliver me out of the hands
of the barbarians. I continued in this
posture about two hours; and began
to be mighty impatient for intelligence
abroad, for 1 had no spies to send out.
'After Bitting awhile longer^ and musing
what 1 should do in this, 1 was not able
to bear sitting in ignorance any longer;
so setting up my ladder to the side of
the hill, where there was a lit place, as
I observed before, and then pulling the
ladder up after me, 1 set it up again,
and mounted to the top of the hill •; and
pulling out my pcrspective-gltise$ which
 
 
m
I had taken on purpose, 1 ink! me down
Hat on hi? belly on ,the ground, and
began to look for the place. 1 pre-
sently found Acre were no less than
nine naked savage*, sitting round a
small fire they had made, not to warm
them, for they had no need of that, the
weather being extremely hot, but, as 1
supposed, to dress some of their barba-
rous diet of human flesh, which they
had brought with them, whether alive
or dead I could not tell.
They had two canoes with them,
which they had hauled up upon the
sin re; and as it was then tide of ebb,
the? seemed to me to wait for the re-
turn of the flood to go away again. It
U not easy to imagine what confusion
this sight put me into, especially seeing
them come on my side of .the island,
and m near me too; but when 1 consi-
dered their coining must be always
with the current of the ebb, I. began,
afterwards, to be more sedate in my
mind, being satisfied that I might go
abroad with safety all the time of the
tide of lood, if they were not on shore
before; and having made this observa-
tion, 1 went abroad about my harvest-
work with the more composure.
As 1 expected, so it proved; for as
soon as the tide made to the westward,
I saw them all take boat, and row (or
paddle, as we call it) away. 1 should
have observed, that for an hour or more
before they went off, they went a~dun*
cittg; and 1 could easily discern their
postures and gestures by my glass. 1
could not perceive, by my nicest obser-
vation, but that they were stark naked,
and had not the least covering upon
them j but whether they were men or
women, 1 could not distinguish.
As soon as 1 saw them shipped and
gone, 1 took two guns upon my shoul-
ders, and two pistols in my girdle, aad
nay great sword by my side,' without a
scabbard, aad with all the speed 1 was
able to make, went away to the. hill
where I had discovered the irst appear-
ance of all; and as soon as 1 got thi-
ther, which was not in less than two
hours (for 1 could not go apace, being
sojoaden with arms as 1 was), I per-
ceived 'there had been three canoes
more, of savages at that place;, and
looking out farther, 1 saw that they
were all at sea together, making over
for the main. This wm a dreadful
sight to me, especially m$f goiog down
to the shore, 1 could »ee the mark* of
horror, which the dismal work they
had been about had left behind it, viz.
the blood, the bones, and part of the
flesh, of human bodies, eaten ami de-
voured by those wretches with merri-
ment and sport, 1 was so filled with
indignation at the sight, that I now be-
gan to premeditate the destruction of
the next that I saw there, let them,be
whom or how many soever. It seemed
evident to me that the visits which they
made thus to this island were not
very frequent, for it was above fifteen
months before any more of them .came
on shore there again; that is to say, 1
neither saw them, nor any footsteps or
signals of them, in all that time j for,
as to the rainy seasons, then they are
sure not to come abroad, at least not
so far; yet all this while 1 lived un-
comfortably, by reason of the constant
apprehensions of their coming upon
me by surprise: from whence 1 observe,
that the expectation of evil is more bit-
ter than the suffering, especially if
there is no room to shake olf that ex-
pectation, or those apprehension**
During all this time 1 was in the
murdering humour, and took up most
of my hours, which should hate been
better employed, in contriving-how to
circumvent and fall upon theuv the
very next time I should see them;
especially if they should be divided, as
they were the last time, into two par-
ties: nor did 1 consider at all,, that if
1 killed one party, suppose ten or a
dozen, I was still the next day, or
week, or month, to kill another, and
so another, even mi infinitum, till I
should be at length no less a murderer
than they were in being man-eaters,
and perhaps much more m, I spent
my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting,, that 1
should, one day or other, fall into-the
hands of these merciiesa creatures $ and
if I did at any time Venture abroad, it
was not without looking round me with
the greatest care and caution imagina-

for 1 durst not,, upon any account, fire
my gun, espcci&liy uear that side of the
iftfand where they usually came, lest I
should alarm the savages; and If they
bad ied from me now, 1 was sure to
have thorn eotne again, with perhaps
two or three hundred canoes with
them* in a few days,, and then I knew
what to expect. However, 1 wore out
a year and three months in ore before I
ever saw any more of the savages, and
then 1 found them again, as 1 shall
soon observe. It is true, they might
hate 'been there once or twice, hut
either they made no stay, or at least I
did not see them: but in the month of
May, as near as 1 could calculate, and
in my four^and-twentieth year, 1 had a
very strange encounter with them j of
which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during
this fifteen or sixteen, months' inter-
val, was very great; 1 slept unquiet,
dreamed always frightful dreams,aud of-
ten started out of my sleep in the night:
in the day great troubles overwhelmed
my mind; and in the night,, I dreamed
often of killing the savages,'and of the
reasons why 1 might justify the doing
of it But, to wave all this for a while,
—It was' in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my
poor Wooden calendar would reckon,
for 1 marked ail upon the post still $ I
say, It was on the sixteenth of May
that it blew a very great storm of wind
all day, with a great deal of lightning
aid thunder, arid a very foul night It
wis after it, 1 knew not what was the
particular occasion of it, but as 1 was
rinding in the Bible, and taken itp with
?lry serious thoughts about my pre-
sent condition, twas surpri^d with the
imlm of a gun, as I thought, Ired at

quite of a different nature from any i

this put into my thoughts were quite of
another kind. 1 started up in the
grtlteitt haste intagiuable, and^ in a
ttlm$ clapped my ladder to the middle
plise of the rock, and pulled it after
rm i and tnotmttag it the second
th&fc, got to the top of the hill the
vety iBjbMettt tlitt a flash of Ire bid'
in», listen for a second "gun, which ac-
cotffitigfy, in about Matf-* mlmm, I
heard. $ and, by the sound, kaert that
it was from that part of the sea where"
1 was driven down the current in> -my
boat, I immediately considered that
this must be some ship in distress*'
and that they had some comrade, or>
some other ship in company, and Ired
these guns for signals of distress, and •
to obtain help. I had the presence of
mind, at that minute, to think, that
though 1 could not help them, it
might be they might help me s so 1
brought together all the dry wood 1
could get at hand, and making a good
handsome pile, 1 set it on ire upon
the hill. The wood was dry, and
blazed freely; and though the wind
blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out;
so that 1 was certain, if there was any
such thing as a slip, they imiht needs
see it; and no doubt they did 5 for as
soon as ever my ire blazed up 1 heard 
another ,gun, "and after that several
others, all from the same quarter. 1
plied my ire all night long, till day-
break $ and when if was broad day, and
the air cleared up, I saw something at
a great distance at sea, full east of the •
island, whether a sail or a hull 1 could
not distinguish, no, not with my glassy
the distance was so  great, and the wea-
ther still something lazy also j at least, -
it was so out at sea.
1 looked frequently at it all that day,
and soon perceived that it did not
move; so I presently concluded that'll
was a ship at anchor.; and being eager,.
you may be sure, to be satisfied/1
took my gun in my hand, aid ran to-
wards the south side of the island, to
the rocks where I had formerly been
carried away with the current; and
getting up there, the weather by thi§ -
time being perfectly clear, 1 could
plainly see, to my great sorrow, the
Wreck of a ship, cast away in, the
night noon those concealed rocks which 
I found when 1 was out in my boat *
and which rocks, as they checked the:
Tioleace of the stream, .and made a
kind of counter-stream, or eddy, were
the occasion of- my  recovering from
the most desperate, hopeless condition
that ever I had been in* all my life,

A J) VENTURIS OF
 
and which, the water being ebbed out,
1 could see; but they were too big to
'meddle with. 1 saw several chests,
which I believed belonged to some of
the seamen; and I got two of them
into the boat, without examining whut
was in them. Had the stern of the
ship been fixed, and the forepart
broken off, I am persuaded I might
have made u good voyage; for, by
what I found in these- two chests, 1
had' room to suppose the ship had a
great deal of wealth on board; and, if
1 _ may guess from the course she
steered, she must have been bound
from Buenos Ayres, or the, Eio de la
Plata, in the south part of America,
beyond the Brazil?, to the Ilavanna, in
the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to
'Spain. She had, no doubt, a great
treasure in her, but of no use, at that
time, to any body; and what became
of her crew, 1 then knew not,
1 found, besides these chests, a
little cask full of liquor, of about
twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much difficulty. There were
several muskets in the cabin, and a
great powder-horn, with about four
pounds of powder in it; as for the
muskets, 1 had no occasion for them,
so 1 left them, but took the powder-
horn. 1 took a fire-shovel and tongs,
which, 1 wanted extremely; as also
two little brass kettles, a copper pot to
make chocolate, and a gridiron: and
'with tliis cargo, and the dog* I came
'away, the fide'liogiiieing to make home
again j and the same evening, about
'an hour within night, 1 reached the
'island again, weary and fatigued to
'the last degree, 1 reposed that night
/'in the boat; and in the morning 1 re-
'solved to harbour what 1 had got in
1 'toy' new cave, and not carry it home to
my castle. After refreshing myself, I
got all my cargo on shore, and began
to examine the particulars. The cask
of liquor 1 found to be a kind of ruin,
'but not such as we had at the Brazils,
'and, in' a word, not at all good; but
; when I came to open the chests, I
/found several,things of great use, to
1 irie': for example, I found'in one a fine
. case ' of bottles, of an extraordinary
"kind, find filled with cordial waters,
fin.* and very good; the'bottles, held
about three pints each, and were lipped
with silver. I found two pots* of .very
good succadcs, or sweetmeats, so
fastened also on the top, that the salt
water had not hurt them; and two
more of the' same, which the water
had spoiled. I found some very good
shirts, which were very welcome to
me; and about a dozen and a, half. of
white linen handkerchiefs and coloured
fieekcloths; the former were also very
welcome, being exceeding refreshing
to wipe my face in a hot day. Be-
sides this, when 1 came to the till in
the chest, I found there three great
hags of pieees-of-eight, which held
about eleven hundred pieces in all;
and in one of them, wrapped up in a
paper, six doubloons of gold, and some
small bars or wedges of gold; I sup-
pose they might all weigh near a
pound. In the other chest were some
clothes, but of little value; but, by the
circumstances, it must have belonged
to the gunner's mate; though there
was no powder in it, except two
pounds of Ine glazed powder, in three
small flasks, kept, 1 suppose, for
charging their fowling-pieces on occa-
sion, upon the whole, I got very little
by this voyage that was of any use to
me; for, as to the money, I had no
manner of occasion ' for it; it was to
me as the dirt under my feet; and I
would have given it all for three or
four pair of English shoes and stock-
ings, which were things I greatly
wanted, but had none on my feet for
many years, I had indeed got two
pair of shoes now, which 1 took off the
feet of the two drowned men whom I
saw in the wreck, and 1 found two
pair more in one of the chests, which
were very welcome to me; but they
were not like our English shoes,
either for ease or service, being rather
what we call pumps than shoes. 1
found in this seaman's chest about
fifty picces-of-eight in rials, but no
gofd: 1 suppose this belonged to a
poorer man than 'the other, which
seemed to belong to gome officer,
Well, however, 1 lugged this money
home to my cave, and laid it up, as I
had clone that before, which I brought
from our own ship: but it was a great
pity* ,as I said, that the other pari of
eobinson riu;soi«;
!lfl
 
this ship had not come to my share;
for f urn satisfied ! might have loaded
my canoe several times over with
money; and, thought I, if I ever
escape to "England, it might lie here
safe enough till 1 may conic again arid
fetch if.
Ifaving now brought all my things
on shore, and secured them, I went
hack to myhoat, and rowed or puddled
her alonir the .shore to her old harhour,
where 1 laid her up, and made the
best of my way to my old habitation,
where I found" every* thing safe and
<piiet. f began now to repose myself,
lire after my old fashion, and take care
of my farnify affair?; and, for a while,
I lived easy enough, only that I was
more vigilant than I used to be, looked,
out oftcner, and did not go abroad so
much; and if at anytime 1 did stir
with any freedom, it, was always to the
east part of the island, where 1 was
pretty well satisfied the savages never
came", and where I could go without
so many precautions, and such a loud
of anus and ammunition as I always
carried with ine if I went the other
way. 1 lived in this condition near
two years more; but my unlucky head,
that*was always to let me know it was
bom to make my body miserable, was
all these two years filled with projects
and designs, how if it were possible, 1
might get away from this island; for,
sometimes 1 was for making another
voyage to the wreck, though my
reason told me that there was nothing
left there worth the hazard of my
voyage; sometimes for a ramble one
way, sometime another; and 1 believe
verily, if I had had the boat that!
went from Sal lee in, I should have
ventured to sea, bound any where, 1
knew not whither. 1 have been, in all
my circumstances, a memento to those
wfio are touched with the general
plague of mankind, whence, for aught
I know, one half of their miseries flow;
I mean that of not being satisfied with
the station wherein God and nature
httth placed them: for, not to look
back upon my primitive condition, and
the excellent advice of my father, the
opposition' to which was, as 1 may
fall it, my drtginal sin, my subsequent
fiii'stakes of the same kind had been
the means of my coming into this
miserable 'condition; for had that
Providence, which so happily seated
me at the Brazils as a planter, blessed
me with confined desires, and, J could
have, been contented to have gone on
gradually, I might have been, by this
time, 1 mean in the time of my F>eing
in ibis island, one of the most con-
siderable planters in the Brazils; hay,
f am persuaded, that by the improve-
ments 1 bad made in that. little time I
lived there, and the increase f should
probably have made if 1 had remained,
I might have been worth a hundred
thousand moidores: and what business
had 1 to leave a settled fortune, a well
stocked plantation, improving and in-
creasing, to turn supercargo to (Juinea
to fetch negroes, when patience and
time would have so increased onr
stock at home, that we could have
bought them at our own door from
those whose business it was to fetch
them; and though it had cost us
something more, yet the difference of
that price was by no means worth
saving ;$l so great a hazard? But as
this is usually the fate of young heads,
so reflection upon the folly of it is as
commonly the exercise, of more years,
or of the dear-bought experience of
time: so it was with me now; and
yet so deep had the mistake taken root
m my temper, that I could not satisfy
myself in my station, but was contin-
ually poring upon the means and pos-
sibility of my escape from this place;
and that I may, with the greater plea-
sure to the reader, bring on the re-
maining part of my story, it may not
be improper to give some account of
my first conceptions on the subject of
this foolish scheme for my escape, and
how, and upon what foundation, 1
acted,
I am now to be supposed retired
'into my castle, after my late voyage
to the* wreck, my frigate laid up and
secured under water, as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was 'be-
fore; I had more wealth, Indeed, than
1 had before, but was not at all the
richer; for I had no more use for it
than the Indians of Peru had .before
the Spaniards came there.
It was one of the nights in the rainy

ADVENTURES OF
season in March, the four-and-twen-
ttetli year of my first setting foot in
this, island of solitude, I was lying in
my bed, or hammock, awake; very
well in health, had no pain, no dis-
temper, no uneasiness of body, nor any
uneasiness of mind, more than ordina-
ry, hut could by no means close my
eyesi that is, so as to sleep; no not a
wink all night long, otherwise than as
follows :—It is impossible to set down
the innumerable crowd of thoughts
that whirled through that great tho-
rough-fare of the brain, the memory,
ia this night's time: I ran over the
whole history of my life in miniature,
or by abridgement, as 1 may call it, to
my coming to this island, and also of
that part of my life since I came to
this island. In niy reflections upon
the state of my case since I came on
shore on this island, I was comparing
the happy posture of my affairs in the
first years of my habitation here, com-
pared to the life of anxiety, fear and
care, which I had lived in ever since
I had seen the print of a foot in the
sa»d; not that I did not believe the
savages had frequented the island even
all the while, and might have been
several hundreds of them at times on
shore there; but I had never known
it, and was incapable of any apprehen-
sions about it, my satisfaction was per-
fect, though my 'clanger was the same,
and I was as happy in not knowing my
danger as if I had never really been
exposed to it. This fnrnished my
thoughts with many very profitable
rejections, and particularly this one:
how infinitely good that Providence is,
which has provided, in its government
of mankind, such narrow bounds t©
his sight and knowledge of things 5 and
though he walks in the midst of so
many thousand dangers, the sight of
which,  if discovered to him, would
distract his mind and sink his spirits,
he,is kept serene and calm, behaving
the events of things hid from his eyes,
and knowing nothing of the dangers
which surround him.
g After these thoughts had for some
tltn,e entertained me, I came to relect
seriously upon the real danger I had
been in'for so many years in this very
Island, mi how I bad walked about in
the greatest security, and with ai pos-
sible tranquillity even when perhaps*
nothing but the brow of a hill, a great
tree, or the casual approach of night,
had been between me and the worst
kind of destruction, viz. that of falling
into the hands of cannibals and savages,
who would have seized on me with the
same view as I would on a goat or a
turtle, and hare thought it no more a
crime to kill and devour me, than I did
of a pigeon or curlew. I would tin-
justly slander myself, if I should say
I was not sincerely thankful to my
great Preserver, to whose singular
Erotection I acknowledged, with great
utnility, all these unknown deliver-
ances were due, and without which I
must^ inevitably have fallen into their
merciless hands.
When these thoughts were over, my
head was for some time taken up in
considering the nature of these wretch-
ed creatures, I mean the savages, ant!
how it came to pass in the world, thai
the wise Governor of all things should
give up any of his creatures to such
inhumanity,* nay, to something so
much below even brutality itself, as to
devour its own kind: but as this end-
ed in some (at that time) fruitless
speculations, it occurred to me to in-
quire, what part of the world these
wretches lived in? how far off* the
coast was, from whence they came r
what they ventured over so far from
home for? what kind of boats they
had? and why I might not order
myself and my business so, that I
might be as able to go over thither as
they were to come to me?
I never so much as troubled myself
to consider what I should do with my-
self when I went thither? what would
become of me, if I fell into the hands
of the savages j or how I should escape
from them, if they attacked me; no,
nor so much as how it was possible
for me to reach the coast, and not be
attacked by some or oilier of them;
without any possibility of delivering
myself; and if I should not fall into
their hands, what 1 should do for pro-
vision, or whither I should bend my
course: none of these thoughts, I say,
so much as came in my way; but my'
mind was wholly bent upon the notion
 
 
 
101
<jf my passing over In my boat to the
main land. I looked upon my present
condition as the most miserable that
could possibly be ; that 1 was not able
to throw myself into any thing, but
death, that could be called worse § and
if 1 reached the shore of the main, f
might perhaps meet with relief, or I
might coast along, as i did on the
African shore, till 1 came to some
inhabited country, and where f might
find some relief; and after all, per-
haps, 1 might fall in with some Chris-
tian ship that might lake me in; and
if the worst came to the worst, 1 could
but die, which would put aw end to all
these miseries at once. Pray note*
all this, was the fruit of a disturbed
mind, an impatient temper, made des-
perate, as it were, by the long con-
tinuance of my trouble?, and the
disappointments I had met in the
wreck I had been on board of, and.
where 1 had been so near obtaining
what 1 go earnestly longed for, viz.
somebody to speak to, and to learn
some knowledge from them of the
place where i was, and of the probable
means of my deliverance, i was agi-
tated wholly by these thoughts; all
my calm of mind, in my resignation
to Providence, and waiting the issue
of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed
to be suspended; and 1 had as it were,
no power to turn my thoughts to any
thing but to the project of a voyage to
the main; which came upon me with
such force, and such an impetuosity
of desire, that it was not to be resist-
ed. ^
When this had agitated ray thoughts
for two hours or more, with such
violence that it set my very blood into
a ferment, and my pulse beat as if 1
had been in a fever, merely with the
extraordinary fervour of ni? mind
about it, nature, as if 1 had been
fatigued and exhausted with the very
thought of it, threw me into a sound
sleep. One would have thought 1
should have dreamed of it, but 1 did
not, -nor of any thing relating to it:
hut 1 dreamed that as" 1 was going out
in the moroiug, as usual from my* cas-
tle, I saw, upon the shore two canoes
and eleven savages coming to land,
and that they brought with them ano-
ther savage, whom they were going 'to
kill, in order to eat him; when, on ft
sudden, the savage that they were go*
ing to kill jumped away, and mn for
his life; and I thought, in my sleep,
that he came running into my little
thick grove before my fortification, to
hide himself: and that I, seeing him
alone, and not perceiving that the
others sought him that way, showed
myself to him, and smiling upon him*
encouraged him, that he kneeled down
to me, seeming to pray to me to assist
him; upon which 1 showed Mia
my ladder, made him go tip, and car-
ried him into my cave, and he be-
came my servant: and that as soon
as 1 had got this man, I said to my-
self, now I may certainly venture to
the. main land; for this fellow will
serve me as a pilot, and will tell
me what to do, and whither to go
for provisions, and whither not to go
for fear of being devoured; what
places to venture into, and what to
shun. I waked with this thought;
and was under such inexpressible im-
pressions of joy at the prospect of my
escape in my dream, that the disap-
pointments which 1 felt upon coining
lo myself, and finding that it was no
more than a dream, were equally ex-
travagant the other way, and threw me
into a very great dejection of spirits.
Upon this, however, 1 made this
conclusion; that my only way to go
about to attempt an escape was, if pos-
sible, to get a savage into my posses
sion; and, if possible, it should be one
of their prisoners whom they had con-
demned to be eaten, and should bring'
hither to kill. But these thoughts still
were attended with this difficulty, that
it was impossible to effect this without
attacking a whole caravan of them,
and killing them all; and this was not
only a very desperate attempt mm!
might miscarry, but, on the other
hand, 1 had greatly scrupled the law*"
fulness of it to myself; and my healt'
trembled at the thoughts of shedding
so much 'blood, though1 it was for' toy
deliverance, !need not repeat the ar-
guments which occurred to me against
this; they being the same mentioned'
be fore: out -though I had otter rea-
sons to offer now, viz. that those men

were enemies to my-life, and would de-
vour, tne If they could; that it was self*
preservation, in the highest degree, to
deliver myself from this deuth of a life,
and was acting in my own defence as
much as if they were actually assault-
ing tue, and the like; I say, though
these things argued for it* yet the
thoughts of shedding human blood for
my deliverance were very terrible to
mc, and such as! could by no means
reconcile myself to for a great while.
However, at last, after many secret dis-
putes with myself, and after great per-
plexities about it (for all these argu-
ments, one way and another, struggled
in my head a long time), the eagtr pre-
vailing desire of deliverance at' length
mastered all the rest; and 1 resolved, if
possible, to get one of those savages
into my hands, cost what it would.
My next thing was to contrive how to
do it, and this Indeed was very difficult
to resolve on: but as I could pitch
upon no probable means for it, so 1 re-
solved to put myself upon the watch, to
see them when they came on shore,
and leave the rest to*the event; taking
such measures as the opp
should present, let what would be.
With these resolutions in my
thoughts, ! set myself upon the scout
as often as possible, and indeed so
often, that 1 was heartily tired of it;
foi* it was above a year and a half that I
waited; and for great part of that time
went out to the west end, and to the
south-west corner of the island, almost
every dav, to look for canoes, but none
appeared This was very discourag-
ing, and began to trouble me much;
though 1 cannot say that it did in this
case (as it had done some time before)
wear off the edge of my desire to the
thing; but the longer it seemed to be
delayed, the more eager 1 was for it;
ill a word, 1 was not at first so careful
to slum the sight of these savages, and
'avoid being seen by them, as 1 was now
eager to be upon them. Besides, 1
'fancied myself able to manage one, nay,
t\vq or three savages, if 1 had them, so
as to make them entirely slaves to me,
to' clo whatever 1 should direct them,
'and to prevent their being aide at any
tiimi'to do me any hurt. It was a
great while that I pleased myself with
this affair; but nothing still presented:
all my fancies and schemes came to no-
thing, fcr no savages came near me for
a great while.
About a year and a half after I enter-
tained these notions (and by long mu-
sing had, as it were, resolved them all
into nothing, for want of an occasion to
put them into execution), 1 was sur-
prised, one morning early, with seeing
no less than five canoes all on shore to-
gether on my side of the island, and
the people who belonged to them all
landed, and out of my sight. The
number of them broke all my mea-
sures; for seeing so many, and know-
ing that they always came four or six,
or sometimes more, in a boat, I could
not tell what to think of if, or how to
take my measures, to attack twenty or
thirty men single-handed; so lay still
in my castle, perplexed and discom-
forted: however, J put myself into all
the same postures for an attack that I
had formerly provided, and was just
ready for action, if any thing had pre-
sented. Having waited a good while,
listening to hear if they made any
noise, at length, being very impatient,
1 set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and clambered up to the top of the hill,
by my two stages, as usual; standing
so, however, that my heat! did not ap-
pear above the hill, so that they could
not perceive mc by any means. Here
! observed, by the help of my perspec-
tive-glass, that they were no less than
thirty in number; that they had'a ire
kindled, and that they had meat dressed*.
How they had cooked it I knew not, or
what it was; but they were all dancing,
in I know not how many barbarous
gestures and figures, their own way,
round the lire.
While 1 was thus looking on them, I
perceived, by my perspective, two mi-
serable wretches dragged from the
boats, where, it seems, they were laid
by, and were now brought-out for the
slaughter. I perceived one of them
immediately fall, being knocked down,
I suppose, with a club or wooden
sword, for that was their way, and two
or three others were at work imme-
diately, cutting him open for their
cookeryr while the other victim was
left standhnr !>V himself, till they should

l»e ready for him. In that very moment,
this pour wretch seeing himself a little
at liberty, and unbound, nature inspired
liitii with hopes of life, and he started
away (mm them, and ran with incredi-
ble wwiftness along the sands, directly
towards me, I mean toward* that pint
of the coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frightened, 1 must ac-
knowledge, when I perceived him run
my way, and especially when, m I
thought, I saw him pursued by the
whole body: and now I expected* that
part of my dream wan coming' to pass,
and that lie would certainly take shelter
in my grove: but I could not depend,
by any means, upon my dream for the
rest of it, vix. that the other savages
would not pursue him thither, and lind
him there. However, 1 kept my sta-
tion, and my spirits began to recover,
when 1 found that there was not above
three men that followed him; and still
more was J encouraged when I found
that lie outstripped them exceedingly
in running, and gained ground of them";
so that if lie could hut hold it for half
an hour, 1 saw easily lie would fairly
get away front them all.
There wm between them and my
castle the creek, which I mentioneel
often in the first part of my story, where
I landed my cargoes out of the ship;
and this Isaw plainly he must necessarily
swim over, or the poor wretch would
lie taken there: hut when the savage
escaping came thither, lie made nothing
of it, though the tide was then up; but
plunging in, swam through in about
thirty strokes, or the real touts, landed,
and ran on with exceeding strength
and swiftness. When the three per-
sona came to the creek, 1 found that
two of there could swim, but the third
could not, and that, standing on the
other side, lie looked at the others, but
went no farther, and soon after went
softly back again; which, as it hap-
pened, was very well for him in the end,
1 observed, that the two who swam were
yet more than twice as long swimming
over the creek as the fellow was that fled
from them. It came now very warmly
upon my thoughts, and indeed" irreaisti-
bly,that now was the time to get rne a ser-
vant, and perhaps a companion or assis-
tant, and that I was called plainly by Pro-
vidence to save this poor creature's life.
1 immediately ran down the ladders
with ail possible expedition, fetched
my two guns, for they were both at the'
foot of tiit. bidders, as I observed above*
and getting1 up again, with the same ,
haste, to the top of the hill. 1 crossed
toward the sea, and having t| very'
short cut, unci all flown hill, placed my-
self in the way between the pursuers
and the pursued, holloing aloud to him
that tied, who, looking' back, was at
first, perhaps, m muen frightened at
nie as at them; but 1 beckoned with
my hand to him to come back; and,
in the mean time, 1 slowly advanced'
towards flie two that followed; then
rushing af once upon the foremost, 1
knocked him down with the stock of
my piece. 1 was loth to lire,, because
I would not have the rest hear; though,
at that distance, it would not have been
easily heard,, and being out of sight of
the smoke too, they would not' have
easily known what to make of it.
Having knocked this fellow down, the
other who pursued him stopped, as if
ha had been frightened, and 1 advanced
apace towards hiin : but asl came nearer,
1 perceived presently lie had a bow and
arrow, and was fitting it to nhimt at
me; sol was then necessitated to shoot
at him first, which 1 did, and killed him
at the first shot. The poor savage
who fled but had stopped, though he
saw both his enemies fallen and killed,
as he thought, yet was so frightened
with the lire and noise of my piece,
that he stood stock-still, and* neither
came forward nor wcut backward,
though he seemed rather inclined still
to fly, than to come on. I holloed
again to him, and made signs to come
forward, which he easily understood,
and came a little way; then stopped
again, and then a little farther, and
stopped again; and 1 could then per-
ceive that he stood trembling, as if lie
had been taken prisoner, and had just
been to be killed, as his two enemies
were. I beckoned to him again/ to
come to me, and gave hitn all the signs
of encouragement that 1 ewtld think
of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve
step, in. token of acknowledgement hr
saving his life. I smiled at. him 'and
 
h 4
ADVENTURES OP
 
looked.pleasantly, and beckoned to him
; to .come still nearer; at length he came
close to me; and then lie kneeled down
again, kissed the giotiiid, and laid Ms
head upon the ground, and taking* me
by the foot, set my foot upon his head j
this, it seems, was in token of swearing
to he my slave for ever. 1 took him
up, and made much of him, and encou*
raged him all I could. But there was
more work to do yet; for I perceived
the savage whom I knocked down was
not killed, hut stunned with the blow,
and. began to come to himself: so I
pointed to him, and showed him the
savage, that he was not dead; upon
this he spoke some words to me, and
though I could not understand them,
yet I thought they were pleasant to
hear; for they were the first sound of
a man's voice that J had heard, my own
excepted, for above twenty-five years.
But there was no time for such reflec-
tions now; the savage who was
knocked clown recovered himself so
far as to sit up upon the ground, and
1 perceived that my savage began
to be afraid j but when I saw that, I
presented my other piece at the man,
as. if 1 would shoot him: upon this rny
savage, for so I call him now, made a
motion to me to lend him my sword,
which hung naked in a belt by ray side,
which,! did. He no sooner had it, but
he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow,
cut ,off his head so cleverly, no execu-
tioner in Germany could have clone it
sooner or better; 'which I thought; very
strange, for one who I had reason to
believe, never saw a sword in his life
before,, except their own wooden
swords: however, it seems, as 1 learned
afterwards, they make their wooden
swords so sharp, so heavy, and the
wood is so hard, that they will cut off
heads even with them, aye, and arms,
and, that at one blow too. When he
had, done this, he comes laughing to
uieA ,ia sign of triumph, and brought
me! the sword again, and with abun-
dance of. gestures, which I did not un-
derstand, laid it down, with the head of
th^s'ayage that he had killed, just before
mej' But» .that which astonished him
tiiost,/was. to know how 1 killed the
otHc'rlnftMns'o far offjso pointing to him,
be"made signs to me to let hiuigo to •
him; so I bade him go, as well 1 couhL
When he came to liim, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him, turning
him irst on one side, then on the other,
looked at the wound the bullet had
made, which, it seems, was just in his
breast, where it had made a hole, and
no great quantity of blood had followed $<
but he had bled inwardly, for he was
quite dead. He took up his bow and
arrows,and came back; so I turned to go
away, and beckoned him to follow me,
making signs to him that more might
come after them. Upon this, he made
signs to me that he should bury them
with sand, that they might not be seen
by the rest, if they followed;. and so 1
made signs to hiin again to do so. He
fell to work ; and, in an instant, he
had scraped a hole in the sand with his
hands, big enough to bury the first in,
and then dragged him into it, and co-
vered him; and did so by the other also:
1 believe he had buried them both in a
quarter of an hour. Then calling him
away, !carried him, not to my castle,
but quite away to my cave, on the far-
ther pari of the island: so 1 did not let
rny dream come to pass in that part,
viz. that he came Into my grove for
shelter. Here I gave him bread and a
bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught
of water, which I found he was indeed
in great distress for, by his running;
and having refreshed him, I made signs
for him to go and lie down to sleep,
showing him a place where I had laid
some rice-straw, and a blanket upon it,
which I used to sleep upon myself
sometimes; so the poor creature.lay
down, and went to sleep.
He was a comely, handsome fellow,
perfectly well made, with straight
strong limbs, not too large, tall, and
well-shaped; and, as f reckon, about
twenty-six years of age. He had a
very good countenance, not a fierce and
surly aspect, but seemed to have some-
thing very manly in his face; and yet
he had all the sweetness and softness
of an European in his countenance too,
especially when he smiled. His hair
was long and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large;
and a great vivacity and sparkling sharp-
ness in his eyes.* The colour1 of his
skin wae not quite black, bat very taw*

ny; awl yet not m ugly, yellow, nau-
seous tawny, as the Brazilians and Vir-
ginians, ami other natives of America
are, hut of a bright kind of a dun-olive
colour, that had In It something very
agreeable, though not very easy to des-
cribe. Ills face "was round and plump;
his nose small, not flat like the Ne-
groes; a very good mouth, thin lips,
and his* line teeth well set, and as white
m ivory.
After lie had slumbered, rather than
slept, about half an hour, lie awoke
again, and came out of the cave to me,
for 1 had been milking my goats, which
1 had in the enclosure just; by; when
he espied ir»e» lie came running to me,
laying himself down again upon the
ground, with all the possible signs of
an humble thankful disposition, making
a great many antic gestures to show it.
At last, lie lays his head flat upon the
ground, close to my foot, and seta my
other foot upon his head, as he had done
before; and after this, made all the
signs "to me of subjection, servitude,
and submission, imaginable, to let me
know how he would serve me so long
as he lived. I understood him in many
things, and let him know 1 was wry
well pleased with him. In a little time
I began to speak to him, and teach him
to speak to me; and, first, 1 let him
know Jilt* name should be Fiuday,
which was the day I saved his life: 1
called him so for the memory of the
time. 1 likewise, taught him to say,
Master; and then let him know that
was to be my name; I likewise taught
him to say Yes and No, and to know the
meaning of them. I gave him some
milk in" an earthen pot, and let him
sQe me drink it before him, and sop
my bread in it; and gave him a cake of
bread to do the like, which he quickly
complied wit!*, and made signs that it
was very good for him. I kept there
with him all that night; but as soon
as if wag day, I beckoned to him to come
witli me, and let him know I would
give him some clothes; at which he
seemed very glad, for he was stark na-
ked As we "went by the place where
lie had'buried the two men, he pointed
exactly to the place, and showed me the
marks that he had made to find them
agajo,making signs to me that we should
di*r them up again, and eat them, At
this 1 nppcareu very angry, expressed
my abhorrence of it, made < as If I would
vomit at the thoughts of it, and beck-
oned with my hand to him to come
away; which lie did immediately, with
great submission. I then led tilm tip
to the top ©f the hill, to see if his ene-
mies were gone; and pulling ont my
glass, I looked, and saw plainly the
place where they had been, but no ap-
pearance of them or their canoes j so
that it was plain they were gone, and
had left their two comrades behind
them, without any search after them.
But I was not content with this.dis-
covery; but having now more courage,
and consequently more curiosity,'" I
took my man Friday with me, giving
him the sword in his hand, with the
bow and arrows at his back, which I
found he could use very dexterously,
making him carry one gun for me, and
1 two for myself; anil away we inarched
to the place where these creatures had
been; fori had a mind now to get some
fuller intelligence of them. 'When f
came to the place, my very blood ran
chill in my veins, and my heart sunk
within me, at the horror of the spec-
tacle; indeed, it was a dreadful right,
at least it was so to me, though Friday
made nothing of it. The place was
covered with human bones, tie ground
dyed with their blood, and great pieces
of flesh left here and there, half-eaten,
mangled, and scorched; and, in short,
all the tokens of the triumphant feast
they had been making there, after a
victory over their enemies, 1 saw three ,
sculls, five hands, and the bones of
three or four legs and feet, and abun-
dance of other parts of the bodies; and
Friday, by his signs, made me under-
stand that they brought over four prl-'
soners to feast upon; that three of them
were eaten tip, and that he, pointing'
to biiodelf, was the fourth; that there
had been a great battle between them
and their next king, whose subjects, it
seems, he had been one of, and that
they bad taken a great number of pri-'
sowers, all which were carried to several
places by those who had taken them in
the fight, in order to feast upon them,
as was done here by these wretches wpon
those tbey.brought hither. '' ,:
Amumvimsor
 
J catwcd Friday to father nil the
Bftiljb, bones, flesh, and whatever re-
mained, and lay them together in a
heap* and make a great ire upon it, and
bum tlieni all to .ashes. 1 found Friday
had still a hanKcring stomach after some
of the flesh, and was still n cannibal in
hid nature; but 1 discovered so much
abhorrence at the very thoughts of it,
and.at the least appearance of it, that
lie durst not discover it; for I had, by
some mcaug, let him know, that 1 would
killjiiin if he offered it.
„ When lie had done this, we came
back to our castle; and there I fell to
work fur my man Friday: and, first of
all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which 1, had out of the poor gunner's
chest,I mentioned* which 1 found in the
wreck; and which, with a little altera-
tion, fitted lino very well: mid then I
made him a jerkin of goat's skin, as
well as my skill would allow (for 1 was
now grown a tolerable good tailor);
and 1 gave him a cap, which 1 made of
hareVskin,, very convenient and fa-
shionable enough: and thus he was
clothed for the present, tolerably well,
and was mighty well pleased to see
himself almost as well clothed as his
master.' It. is true, he went awkwardly
in,these clothes at first; wearing the
drawers was very awkward to him, and
thej sleeves of the waistcoat galled his
shoulders, and the inside of his arms $
but, a little .easing them where he com-
plained they hurt him, and using him-
self, to them, he took to them at length
very. veil.
^fhe; next day after 1 came home to
my.hutcli with him, 1 began to consider
where I should lodge him; and that 1
might do well for him, .and yet be per-
fectly easy myself, I made a-little tent
for/Jiitn in the vacant place between my
t\\o fortifications, in the inside of the
la$t, and in the outside of the first. As
there wag a door or entrance there into
my cave, I made a formal framed door-
case,;, and, a door to it of boards, and
set it up in the passage, a little within
the entrance,; and causing the door to
open In the inside,,! barred it up in the
night, .taking in my ladders too; so
t%| t?rktay could , no way come at me
iij*,ih# inside of, ray innermost wall,
without making ,sp much noise. in get-
ting over that it must needs waken me;
for my first wall had now a complete
roof over it of long poles, covering all
my tent, and leaning up to 'the side of
the hill; which was again laid across
with smaller sticks, instead of laths,
and then thatched over a great, thick-
ness with the rice-straw, which was
strong, like reeds; and at the hole or
place which was left to go in or out by
the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-
door, which, if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened
at all, but would have fallen down, and
made a great noise: as to weapons,, 1
took them all into my side every night.
But 1 needed none of all this precau-
tion; for never man had a more faith-
ful, loving, sincere servant, than Friday
was to me; without passions, sullen-
ness, or designs, perfectly obliged and
engaged; his very affections were tied
to me, like those of a child to a father;
and 1 dare say, lie would have sacrificed
his life for the saving mine, upon any oc-
casion whatsoever: the many testimonies
he gave rue of this put it out of doubt,
and soon convinced me that I needed to
use no precautions as to my safety on
his account.
This frequently gave me occasion to
observe, and that with wonder, that
however it had pleased God, in his pro-
vidence! and in the government of the
works of his hands, to take from so
great a part of the world of his crea-
tures the best uses to which their fa-
culties and the powers of their souls are
adapted, yet that he has bestowed upon'
them the same powers, the same rea-
son, the same affections, the same sen-
timents of kindness and obligation, the
same passions and resentments of
wrongs, the Fame sense of gratitude,
sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities
of doing good, and receiving good, that
he has given to us; and that when he
pleases to offer them occasions of ex-
erting these, they are as ready, nay,
more ready, to apply them to the right
uses for which they w-ere bestowed,
than we are. This made me very me-
lancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as
the several occasions presented, how
mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlight-
ened by the great lamp of instruction,.
 
107
 
 
the Spirit of (iod, and by the knowledge
of his word adflcti to our understanding';
and why it bus pleased God to hide the
like saving knowledge from so many
millions of souls, who, if 1 might judge
by this poor savage, would make a
much better use of it than we did.
From hence, f sometimes was Jed too
far, to invade the sovereignty of Provi-
dence, and as it were arraign the justice
of so arbitrary a disposition of things,
that should hide that light from some,
and reveal it to others, and yet expect
a like duty from both; but 1 shut it up,
and cheeked my thoughts with this
conclusion; first, That we did not know
by what light and law these should be
condemned j but that as God was ne-
cessarily, and, by the nature of his being,
infinitely holy and just, so it could not
be, but if these creatures were all sen-
tenced to absence from himself, it was
on account of sinning against that light
which, as the Scripture says, was a law
to themselves, and by such rules as their
consciences would acknowledge to be
just, though the foundation was not dis-
covered to us; ami, secondly, That still,
an we all are the clay in the hand of the
potter, no vessel could say to him, Why
hast thou formed me thus?
But to return to my new companion:
—1 was greatly delighted with him, and
made it my business to teach him
every thing that was proper to make
him useful, handy,and helpful; but es-
pecially to make him speak, and under-
stand me when I spoke: and he was the
nptest scholar that ever was; and par-
ticularly was so merry, so constantly
diligent, and so pleased when he could
but understand me, or make me un-
derstand him, that it was very pleasant
to iiie to talk to him. Now my life
began to be so easy, that 1 began to
say to myself, that could I but have
been safe from more savages, 1 cared
not if I was never to remove from the
place where 1 lived
After I had been two or three days
returned to my castle, 1 thought that#i
in order to bring Friday off from his
horrid way of feeding,'and from the
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought
to "let him taste other flesh; so ! look
hi in out with me one morning to the
woods, I went, indeed, intending to
kill a kid out of my own Dock,'and •
bring it home and dress it; but as I
was going,! saw a she-goat lying down-
in the shade, and two youn? kids sitting'
by her. 1 eatched hold of Friday ;-*-hoId,
said I, stand still; and; made'signs to
him not to stir: immediately 1 present-
ed my piece, shot, and killed one of
the kids. The poor creature, who had,
at a distance, indeed, seen tne kill the
savage, his enemy, but did  not know,'
nor could imagine, how it was done,
was sensibly surprised, trembled and
shook, and looked so amazed, that I
thought lie would have sunk down.
He did not see the kid I shot at, or per-
ceive 1 had killed it, but ripped up his
waistcoat, to feel whether he was not
wounded; and, as 1 found presently,
thought 1 was resolved to kill him: for
he came and kneeled down to me, and
embracing my knees, said a great many
things J did not understand; but I could
easily see the meaning was, to pray me
not to kill him.
I soon fonnd a way to convince him
that 1 would do him no harm; anil
taking him up by the hand, laughed'ttt
him, and pointing to the kid, which 1
had killed, beckoned to him to run and
fetch it, which lie did: and'while hti
was wondering, and looking to see hdW
the creature was killed, 1 loaded my
gun again. Bye and by, 1 saw a great
fowl, like a hawk, sitting upon a tree,
within shot; so to 'let Friday under-
stand a little what 1 would do* I called
him to me again, pointed at the fowl,
which was indeed a parrot, though I
thought it had been a hawk; f say,
pointing to the parrot, and to my gun,
and to the ground under the parrot,'to
let him see 1 would make it fall, 1 mftde
him understand that f would shoot and
kill that bird; accordingly, I fired, and'
bade him look, and immediately he
saw the parrot fall. He stood like one
frightened again, notwithstanding ail!
hail said to* him,; and 1 found he wis
the more amazed, because lie 'did not
see me put any thing into the gun,
but thought that there must be,some
wonderful fund of death and destruc-
tion in that thing, able to "kill -man,
beast, bird, or any thing nearer far off;
and the astonishment tins created in'hiiw
was stteli, as could'not wear off for a'
 
ADVENTURES OF
long-time;' and 1 believe, if I would
bate let him,  he would have wor-
shipped mc and iiiy gun. ' As for the
gun, itself, lie would not so much as
touch it for several days after: but lie
would speak to it, and talk to it, as if
it had answered him, when he was by
himself; which, as I afterwards learner!
of him, was to desire it not to kill
liitn. Well, after his astonishment was
a little over at this, I pointed lo him to
run-and fetch the bird 1 had shot, which
he did, but staid some time; for the
parrot, not being quite dead had flut-
tered away a good distance from the
place whore she fell; however, he
found her, took her up, and brought
her to me; and as 1 had perceived his
ignorance about the gun before, 1 took
ihm advantage to charge the gun again,
and'not to let him see me do it, that I
might 'be ready for any other mark that
might present; .but nothing more of-
fered at that time: so I brought home
the kid, and the same evening 1 took
the skin off, and cut it out as well as 1
could; and having a pot lit for that
purpose, I boiled or stewed some of
the flesh, and made some very good
broth. After 1 had begun to cat some,
I gave some to ray man, who seemed
very glad of it, and liked it very well;
but that which* was strangest to him,
was - to see me eat salt with it. He
made/a sign to me that the salt was
not goodv to eat; and putting a little
into bis own mouth, he seemed to nau-
seate it, and would spit and sputter at
it, washing his mouth with fresh water
after it: on the other hand, 1 took some
meat' into my mouth without salt, and
1 pretended to spit and sputter for want
of salt, as fast as he had done at the salt;
but it.would not do; he would never cure
for salt with 'his meat or in his broth;
at least, not for a great while, arid then
but ^ very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled
meat and-broth, ! was resolved to feast
him the next day with roasting a piece
of the kidr this 1 did, by hanging it
before the lire on a string, as I had seen
many people' do in England, setting'
two poles tip,' one on each side of the
fire, and one across on the top, and tying
the siring t# the cross stick, letting
the meai turn.'Continually.' This Fri-
day admired very much; but when he
came to taste the flesh, he took so
many ways to tell me how well lie liked
it, that I could not hut understand
him : and at last he told me, as well as,
lie could, he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad
to hear.
The next day, I set him to work to
beating some corn out, and sifting it in
the manner 1 used to do, as i observed
before; and he soon understood how
to do it m well as I, especially after he
had seen what the meaning of it was,
and that it was to make bread of it j
for after that 1 let him see me make
my 'bread and bake it too; and in a
little time Friday was able to do all the
work for me, as well as I could do it
myself.
*! began now to consider, that having
two mouths to feed instead of one, I
must provide more ground for my har-
vest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do; so 1 marked out a
larger piece of land, and began the
fence in the same manner as before, in
which Friday worked not only very wil-
lingly and very hard, but did it very
cheerfully; and I told him what it was
for; that it was for corn to make more
bread, because he was now with me,
and that I might have enough for him
and myself too. He appeared very
sensible of that part, and let me know
that he thought! hnl much more la-
bour upon me on his account, than 1
had for myself; and that he would work
the harder for me, if 1 would tell Mm
what to do.
This was the pleasantest year of all
the life I led in this place j Friday began
to talk pretty well, and understand the
names of almost every thing 1 had oc-
casion to call for, and of every place-1
had to send him to, and talked a great
deal to me; go that, in short, I began
now to have some use for my tongue
again, which, indeed, 1 had very little oc-
casion for before, that is to say, about
speech. Besides the pleasure "of talk-
ing to him, ! had a singular satisfac-
tion in the fellow himself: Ms simple
unfeigned honesty appeared to me more
and more' every day, and ! began really i
to love-the'creature; and, on his side,,'
1 believe he loved me more than it was
 
 
 
 
 
109
possible for him ever to love any tiling
before.
I had a mind once to try if lie had
any hankering inclination to his own
country again; and having taught liiin
English so well that he could answer
me almost any question, I asked him
whether the nation that lie belonged to
never conquered in battle? At \vbieh
he smiled, and said, Yea, yes, we al-
ways fight the better: that is, ho meant,
always get the better in light; and so
we began the following discourse;
Muster, Yon always light the better;
how came yon to he taken prisoner then,
Friday?
Friday. My nation beat much, for
all that.'
Master. How beat? If your nation
beat them, how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more many than my
nation in the place where me was;
they take one, two, three, and raej
my* nation over-beat them in the yon-
der place, where me no was; tnere
my nation take one, two, great thou-
sand.
Master. But why did not your side
recover yon from the hands of your
enemies then?
Friday. They run one, two, three,
and roe, and make go in the canoe;
my nation have no canoe that time.
Master* Well, Friday, and what does
your nation do with the men they take?
Bo they carry them away and eat them,
as these did f
Friday. Yos^ my nation eat mans
too; eat all up.
Matter. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place, where
they think.
Master, Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither,
come other else place.
Mfaster, Have you been here with
them 
Friday. Yes, 1 have been here;
(pointe to the N. W.side of the island,
which* *t seems, was their side.)
By this 1 understood that niy man
Friday had formerly been among the
sa?ages who used to come on shore on
the farther part of the island, on the
same man-eating occasions he was now
brought for; and, some time after,
when I took the courage to carry hip
to that side, being the same 1 formerly
mentioned, he presently knew the
place, and told me lie '\wm there once
when they eat up twenty men, two
women, and one child: lie could'not
tell twentv in English, but he number-
ed them, by laying so many stones in a
row, and pointing- to me to tell than
over.
I have told this passage, because it
introduces what follows] that after 1
had this discourse with him, J asked
him how for it was from our island to
the shore, and whether the canoes were
not often lost. He told me there was
no danger, no canocg ever lost; but
that, after a little way out to sea, there
was a current and wind, always one
way in the morning, the other in the
afternoon. This 1 understood to be no
more than the sets of the tide, as going
out or coming in; but i afterwards
understood it was occasioned by -the
great draft and reins of the mighty
river Oroonoko, in the mouth or guff
of which river, m 1 found afterwards,
our island lay; and that this land which
I perceived to the W. and N. W. was
the great island Trinidad, on the north
point of the mouth of the river.. 1
asked Friday a thousand questions
about the country, the inhabitants, the
sea, the coast, and what nations were
near: he told me all he knew, with the
greatest openness imaginable, 1 asked
him the names of the several nations
of his sort of people, but could get
no other name than Caribs:  from
whence I easily understood, that these
were the Caribbees, which our map!
place on the part of America which
reaches from the mouth of the river
Oroonoko to Guiana, and onwards to
St. Martha. He told me that up ft
great way beyond the moon, thai was
beyond the setting of the moon, which
must be west from their country, there-
dwelt white bearded men, like roe* and
pointed to my great whiskers, which. I
mentioned before; and that they had
killed much mans, that was his word;
by all which 1 understood, he meant
the Spaniards, whose cruelties In-Ame-
rica had been spretd over the whule
country, and were remembered by all
the nations, from father to son.
1 iaqmred if -be could tell me how I
 
 
 
AfWKNTtJRES OF
'might go from this island and get
among those white men; lie told me,
-Yes, yes, you may go in two canoe. 1
<-€*ou}d not understand what he meant,
or make him describe to me what he
meant by two canoe; till, at last, with
great difficulty, f found lie meant it
must 'be in a large boat* as big as two
canoes. This part of Friday's discourse
began to relish, with me very well; and
from this time I entertained some
hopes that, one time or other, 1 might
find an opportunity to make iny escape
from this place, and that this poor
savage might he u means to help me.
During the long time that Friday
had now been with rue, and that he
began to speak to me, and understand
inc, I was not wanting to lay a foun-
dation of religions knowledge in his
mind: particularly I asked him one
time, who' made hint? The poor
creature did not understand me at all,
but thought 1 had asked him who was
liis father: but 1 took it up by another
handle, and asked him who made the
sea, the ground we walked on, and
the hills and woods? He told foe, it
was one old Benamuekee, that lived
-beyond all; he could describe nothing
of this great person, but that lie was
-very old, much older he said, than the
sea.or the land, than the moon or the
stars. ' I asked him then, if this old
person had made all things, why did
not all things worship him? fie looked
very 'grave, and with a perfect look of
innocence said, All things say () to
him. I asked him if the people who
die in "his country went away any
where? He said, Yes; they all went
to Benamuekee: then I asked him
whether these they eat up went thither
too? He said, Yes.
From these things I began to in-
struct him in the knowledge of the
true God: 1 told him that the great
Maker of all things lived up there,
pointing up towards heaven; that he
governed the world by the same power
. aad providence by which he made it;
that he was omnipotent, amd could do
every thing for us, give every thing to
t% take every thing from us *, and
'"thus, by degrees, 1 opened his eyes.
He listened with'great 'attention, and
"revived  'with pleasure" the notion of
Jesus Christ being sent to redeem'its,
and of the manner of leaking our
prayers to God, and his being aide to
hear us, even in heaven. He told me
one day, that it* our God conk! hear
ns up tieyond the mmt he must neeta
be a greater Ood than their Bena-
muekee, who lived but a little way off,
and yet could not hear till they went
up to the great mountains where he
dwelt to speak to him. I asked him
if ever he went thither to speak to
him? He said,'No; they never went
that were young men; none went
thither but the'old men, whom he
called their Oowokakec; that h, as I
made him explain |t to me, their re-
ligious, or clergy; and that they went;
to say (.) (m lie called saying prayers),
and then came back, and told them
what Benamuekee said. -By this I
observed that there is priestcraft even
among the most blinded, ignorant
pagans in the world; and the policy of
making a secret of religion, in order
to preserve the veneration of the
people to the clergy, is not only to he
found in the Roman, but perhaps
among all religions in the world,
even among the most brutish 'and bar-
barous savages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud
to my man Friday; and told him, that
the pretence of their old men going
up to the mountains to say 0 to their
god Benamuekee was a cheat; and
their bringing word from thence what
he said was much more so; that if
they met with any answer, or spake
with any one there, it must be with an
evil spirit: and then 1 entered into a
long discourse with him about the
devil, the original of him, his rebellion
against God, his enmity to man, the
reason of it, his setting himself up in
the dark parts of the world to be
worshipped instead of God, and as
God, and the many stratagems' he
made use of to delude mankind to
their ruin; how he had a secret ac-
cess to our passions and to our affec-
tions, and to adapt his snares to our
inclinations, so as to cause us even to
be our own tempters, and run upon
our destruction by our own choice. 
1 found it was . not so easy to im-
print right notions in his mind about
 
 
 
 
Ill
the devil, as it was about the being of a
God: nature assisted all my arguments
to evidence to him even the necessity
of a great first Cause, and overruling,
governing Power, a secret, directing
Providence, and of the equity and
justice of paying homage to him that
made us, and the like ;% but there ap-
peared nothing of this kind in the
notion of an evil spirit; of his original,
his being', his nature, and, above- all,
of his inclination to do evil, and to
draw m in to do so too: and the poor
ereature puzzled me once in such a
maimer, by a question merely natural
and innocent, that I scarce knew what
to say to him. 1 had been talking a
great deal to him of the power of
God, his omnipotence, his aversion to
sin, his being a consuming fire to the
workers of iniquity; how, as he had
made its all, he eould destroy us ami
all the world in a moment; and he
listened with great seriousness to mc
all the while. After this, I had been
telling him how the devil was God's
enemy in the hearts of men, and used
all his malice and skill to defeat the
good designs of Providence, and to
ruin the kingdom of Christ in the
world, and the like. Well, says Friday,
hut you say God is so strong, so great;
19 he not much strong, much might as
the devil?—Yes, yes, says I, Friday,
God is stronger than the devil: God
ii above the devil, and therefore we
pray to God to tread him down under
our feet, and enable us to resist his
temptations, and quench his fiery
darts.—But, says lie again, if God
mjuch stronger, much might as the
devil, why ~God no kill the devil, so
make him no more do wicked? 1 was
strangely surprised at this question;
and, 'after all, though 1 was now an
old man, yet I was but a young doctor,
and ill qualified for a caauit, or a
solver of difficulties; and, at first,!
could not tell what to say; so 1 pre-
tended not to hear him, and asked him
what he said; but lie was too earnest
for an answer, to forget his question,
go that he repeated it in the very same
broken words as above. By this time
I had recovered myself a little, and 1
said, God will at last punish him se-
verely; lie is reserved for the judg-
ment, and h in be east into the bot-
tomless oit, .to dwell with ^everlasting
fire. This did not satisfy Friday ; hut
lie returns upon me, repeating .my
words, flvseti-t' at im(: me no wider-
stand: but why not kill the devil-now;
not kill great ago?—Yon may as-well
ask me, said I, why God doe* not kill
yon and me, when we do wicked
things here that oilend him? We aft*
preserved to repent and be pardoned.
lie mused some time on this: Well,
well, savs he, mighty affectionately,
that well: so you, I, devil, all wicked,
all preserve, repent, God pardon all.
Here I was run down again by him to
the last degree; and it was a tes-
timony to me, Jtow the mere notions
of nature, though they will guide rea-
sonable creatures to the knowledge of
a God, and of a worship or homage
due to the supreme being of God, as
the consequence of our nature, yet
nothing but divine revelation can form
the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of
redemption purchased for lis, of a Me-
diator uf the new covenant, and of an
Intercessor at the footstool of God's
throne; I say, nothing hut a revelation
from Heaven can form these in the
soul; and that, therefore, the gospel
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
I mean the Word of God, and the
Spirit of God, promised for the* guide
and sanctifier of his people, are the
absolutely necessary instructors of the
souls of men in the saving knowledge
of God, and the means of salvation.
J therefore diverted the present dis-
course between me and my man, rising*
up hastily, as upon some sudden oc-
casion of going out; then sending him
for something a good way off, I se-
riously prayed to God that he would
enable me to instruct savingly this
poor savage; assisting, by his Spirit,
the heart of the poor ignorant creature
to receive the light of the knowledge
of God in Christ, reconciling him to
himself, and would guide me to speak
so to him from the word of Chm* m
his conscience might; be convinced,
his eyes opened, and his soul saved.
When he came again to inc, 1 entered
into a long discourse with him upon
the subject of the redemption of in$n
by the Saviour of the world, and of

Ills word, leading us into all truth, and
making us both willing and obedient
to the instruction of his word. And
1 cannot see the least use that the
greatest knowledge of the disputed
points of religion, which have made
such confusion in the world, would
have been to us, if we could have ob-
tained it*~JJiit 1 must go on with the
historical, part of tbing>Cand take every
part in its order.
After Friday and 1 became more in-
timately acquainted, and that lie could
understand almost all 1 snid to him, and
$ peak pretty fluently, though in broken
English, to me, 1 acquainted him with
my' own history, or at least so much
of It as related to my coming to this
place; how I had lived here, and how
long; 1 let him into the mystery, for
such it was to him, of gunpowder and
bullet, and taught him how to shoot.
I gave him a knife, which lie was won-
derfully delighted with; and 1 made
him a belt, with a frog, hanging to it,
such as in England wo wear hangers in;
and in tfie frog, instead of a hanger,
I, gave him a hatchet, which was not
only m good a weapon, in some eases,
but mucu more useful upon othci* oc-
casions. • 
i described to him the country of
Europe, particularly England, which 1
came from; -how we lived, how we
worshipped God, how we behaved to
one another, and bow we traded in
ships to all parts of the world. I gave
Mm an account of the wreck which 1
had been on board of, and' showed hirn,
aa near as I could, the place where
she lay, lint she was all beaten in
piece* before, and gone, 1 showed
fiijii the ruins of our boat,, which -we
lost when we escaped, awl which 1
could not stir with my whole strength
then; but was now fallen almost all to
pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday
stood musing a great while, and said
nothing. 1 asked him what it was he
studied upon? At last, says he, Me see
such boat like coiae to .place at my na-
tion. I did not understand him* a good
while j but, at last, when 1 had exami-
ned farther- into it, I understood by
him, that a boat, mek as that had been,
came on .shore upon the country where
halived;AtUatisA as.lie explained it, was
driven thither by stress of weather. !
presently imagined that some European
ship must have been cast away upon
their coast* toil the boat might 'get
loose, and drive ashore; but 1 w»b m
dull, that I never once thought of men
making their escape from a wreck
thither, much less whence they might
eome: so 1 only inquired after a as-
cription of the boat.  • •
Friday described the boat to nit well
enough; hut brought me better to tin'*.
clerstaiid htm when lie added, with
some warmth, We save the white limits
from drown. Then ! presently asked
him, if there were any white maus, as
he called them, in the bout? Yes, he
said; the boat full of white iitiins. 1
asked'him how many? lie told upon
his fingers seventeen. I asked' Iitfti
th*»n what became of them? He told
iiic\ They live, they dwell at my nation,
This put new thoughts into my head;
for 1 presently imagined that these
might be the men belonging'to the
ship that was cast away in the sight of
my island; as I now called it; 'and
who, after the ship wa* struck on the
rock, and they saw her inevitably lost,
had saved themselves in their boat, and
were landed upon that wild shore
among the savages. Upon this, I1 in-
quired of him mora critically what was
become of them j he assured me they
lived still there 5 that they hail been
there about four years; that the sava-
ges let the if i alone, and gave them-vie*
tuals to live on. I asked him ltow-it
came to pass they did not kill them-,
and eat them? He said, No, they make
brother with them; that is, m I, under-
stood Mm, a truce; and then he added*
They no eat roans but when make
the war fight; that is to say, they
never eat any men but such as come to
fight with the hi, and are taken in'battle*
'It was after this home considerable
time, that being upon the top of tit©
Mil, at the east side of the island, from
whence, as 1 have said, 1 hail, iii.l*

was'tha matter? O joy! says be; O
glad! there see my country, there
my nation! I observed an extraordi-
nary sense of pleasure appeared In his
face, and his eyes sparkled, and his
eduhtenauce discovered a strange eager-
ness, a* if lie had a mind to be in his
own country again. This observation of
mine put a great many thoughts into
me, which made me at first not so easy
about my new man Friday as 1 was be-
fore | and 1 made no doubt but that if
Friday could get back to his own nation
again, he would not only forget all his
religion, but all his obligation to me,
and" would be forward enough to give
Ms countrymen an account of me, and
tome back perhaps with a hundred or
two of them, and make a feast upon
me, at which he might be as merry as
housed to be with those of his enemies,
when they were taken in war. But 1
wronged the poor honest creature very
much, for which 1 was very sorry after-
wards, However, as my jealousy in-
creased, and held me some weeks, I was
a little more circumspect, and not so
familiar and kind to him as before: in
Which 1 was certainly in the wrong too;
the honest, grateful creature, having no
thought about it, but what consisted
•with the best principles, both as a religi-
ons Christian, and as a grateful friend;
m appeared afterwards, to my full sa-
tisfaction.
* While my jealousy of him lasted,
you may be sure I was every day
•pumping him, to see if he would
discover any of the new thoughts which
I suspected were in him: but f found
~#?ery thing he said was so honest and
.so innocent, that ! could find nothing
'to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite
of ail my uneasiness, he made me at
last entirely his own again; nor did he,
In the least, perceive flat 1 was uneasy,
•and therefore 1 could not suspect him
of deceit.
. /One day, walking up the same hill,
but the weather .being hazy at sea, so
that we could not see the continent, I
'Called to him, and said, Friday, do not
.you wish yourself in four own country,
'your own nation?—Yes, fie said, I be
much O glad to be at my own nation.
*—What would you do there? said I:
, would you tura wild again, eat men's
flesh again, and be a savage, as yon
were before? He looked full of con-
cern, and shaking his head, said, No,
no; Friday tell them to live good, tell
them to pray God, tell them to eat
corn-bread, cattle-flesh, milk; no^eat
man again.—Why then, said I to him,
they will kill you. He looked grave at
that, and then said, No, no; they no
kill me, they willing love iearn^ He
meant by this, they would be willing to
learn, lie added, they learned much
of the bearded mans that came in the
boat. Then I asked him if he would
go back to them, lie smiled at^that,
and told me that he could not swim so
far. I told him, 1 would make a eatwe
for him. He told me he would go, if
1 would go with him. 1 go! says I;
why, they will eat me, if I come there.
—No, no, says he j me make they no
eat you; me make they much love you.
He meant, he would tell them how 1
had killed his enemies, and saved his
life, and so he would make them love
me. Then he told me, as well as he
could, how kind they were to seventeen
white men, or bearded men, as he
called them, who came on shore there
in distress.
From this time, 1 confess 1 had a
mind to venture over, and see if 1 could
possibly join with those bearded men,
who 1 made no doubt, were Spaniards
and Portuguese: not doubting but if'I
could, we might find some method to
escape from thence, being upon the
continent, and a good company toge-
ther, better than I could from an island
forty miles ^off the shore, and alone,
without help. So, after some* days, 1
took Friday to work again, by way of
discourse; and told him 1 would give
him a boat to go back to his own na-
tion; and' accordingly I carried him to
my frigate, which lay on the other side
of the island, and hating cleared it of iva-
ter (for 1 always kept it sunk in water)
"1 brought it out, shewed it him, and
we both wenfc into it. I found he was
a most dexterous fellow at managing
it, and would make it go almost.as
swift again as 1 could. So when he
was in/l said to him, Well, now, Fri-
day, shall we go to your nation? He
looked very dull at my saying so;
which it seems, wis because he thought
 
 
115
the boat too small to go so fur; I then
toM him 1 had a bigger; so the next
day I went lo the place where the fir^t
hoi.it lay which 1 hud made, but which I
could iiot get into the water. He said
that was big enough: hut then, m I had
ftikcii iio rare of it, and it had lain two
or three and twenty years there, the
aim had split and dried it, that it was in
n manner rotten. Friday told me sjuch
a boat would do very well, and would
cftrry much ewHighvittle, drink, bread;
that was his way of talking*.
Upon the whole, f was by this time
80 fixed, upon my design of going over
with him to the continent, that I told
torn we would'go and make one m big
as that, and he should go home in it,
He answered not one word, hut looked
very grave and and, I asked him what
wm the iiiiitf/T with him? lie asked
me again, Why yon angry mad with
Friday? What me clone? I asked him
what he meant; 1 told him I was not
angry with him at all. Ho angry!
saya lie, repeating the word-? several
timei; Why send Friday home away
Co my nation.—Why, says I, Friday,
did not yoti say, you wished yon were
there?—Yes, yes,says lie, wish he both
there; no wwli Friday' there, no mas-
ter there. In a word, he would not
think of going there without me. I
go there, Friday! sqy* I; what shall I
do there? He returned very quick upon
me at this: You do great deal much
good, says he; you teach wild mans
tie good, sober, tame mans; you tell
them know God, pray God, and live
new life.-—Alas! Friday, says I, thou
knowest not what thou say est; I am
hut an ignorant man myself.—'Yes,
yes, says he, you tcachee me good, you
tcachee them good.—-No, no, Friuay,
says I, you shall go without mc; leave
me here to livc'hy myself, as I did
before. He looker! confused again
at that word; and running to "one
of the hatchets which he used to
wear, and he takes it up hastily,
gives it to me. What must I do
with this? says I to him. You take
kill Friday, sap he. What must I kill
you for? said I again. lie returns
vfery quick, What you send Fridav
away for? Take kill Friday: no send
Friday away. This lie tfpokc so ear-
nestly, that 1 saw tears stand in his
eyes: in a word, 1 so plainly discovered
the utmost affection in him to mo, and
ii firm resolution in him, that I told
him then, and often after, that 1 would
never send him away from me, if he
was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as f found, by all
his discourse, a settled aiivction to me,
and that nothing should part him from
me, m 1 found all the foundation of
his desire to go to hi* own country was
laid in hia ardent nflcclioii to tM
people, and his hope? of my doing
them good ; a thing, which, tm 1 had no
notion of mysfdf, so 1 had not the least
thought, or intention, or desire of mi*
dertaking it. But still I found a strong
iiiclination to my attempting an escape,
a^ above, founded on the supposition
gathered from the discourse, via. that
there were scventen bearded men there:
and, therefore, without any more de-
lay, I went to Work with Fridav, to
find out a great tree proper to fell, arid
make a large periagua, or canoe, to un-
dertake the voyage. There were trees
enough in the island to have built a
little fleet, not of periagua-s, or canoes,
but even of good large vessels: hut the
main thing I looked ut was, to get otic
so near the water that we might'launch.
it when it was made, to avoid the mis-
take ! committed at first. At last,
Friday pitched upon a tree; for 1
found he knew much better than I what
kind of wood was fittest for it; nor
can I tell, to this day, what wood to
Call the Wee we cut down* except that
It was very like the tree we call ftistic,
or between that and the Nicaragua
wood, for it was much of the same'co-
lour and smell. Friday was for burn-
ing the hollow or cavity of this tree
oik, to malce it a boat, hut f showed him
how to cut it with tools; which, after
1 had showed him how to ise, he did
very handily; and in about a month's
hard labour we finished it, and made it
very handsome; especially when, with.
our axes, which I showed him how to
handle, we cut and hewed the otftsfrlo
into the true shape of a boat After this,
however, it cost us near a fortnight's
time to get her 'along, as it were'trttti
by inch, upon' great rollers Into the
water; bit When she was1 in, she would

ADVENTURES OF'
 
 
Have carried twenty men with great
ease.
When she was in the water, and
though she was so big, it amazed me
to see with what dexterity, and how
swift my man Friday would manage
her, turn her, and paddle her along.
So 1 asked him if he would, and if we
might, venture over in her. Yes, he
said; we venture over in her very well,
though great blow wind, However, I
had a farther design, that he knew no-
thing of, and that was to make a mast
and a sail, and to fit her with an anchor
and cable. As to a mast, that was
easy enough to get; so I pitched upon
a,straight young cedar tree, which I
found near the place, and which there
were great plenty .of in the island: and
1 set 'Friday to work to cut it down,
and gave him directions how to shape
and order it. But as to the sail, that
was my particular care. I knew I had
old sails or rather pieces of old sails
enough; but m 1 had had them now
six and twenty years by me, and had
not been very careful to preserve them,
'not Imagining that I should-ever have
this kind of use for them, I did not
doubt but they were all rotten, and, in-
deed, most of them were so. How-
ever, I found two pieces, which ap-
peared pretty good, and with these 1
went to work j and with a great deal of
fains, and awkward stitching, you may
e , sure, for want of needles, I, at
length, -made a three-cornered ugly
thing, like what we call in England: a
shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a
boom at bottomland a little short sprit at
the top, sueh as usually ourships' long-
boats sail with, and sueh as 1 best knew
how to manage, as it was such a one I
had to the boat in which I made my
escape from Barbary, as related in the
titet part of my story.
1 was near two months performing
this last work, viz. rigging and fitting
my mast and sails; for I finished thein
fery complete, making a small stay,
and a sail, -or fore-sail, to it, to assist,
if we should turn to, windward; and,
which was more than all, 1 fixed a rud-
der to. the stem of her to steer with. I
was; but a bungling ship-wright, yet, as
1 knew the usefulness, and even neces-
sity of such a thing, I applied myself
with so much pains to do it, that at
last I brought it to pass; though, con-
sidering the many dull contrivances 1
had for it that failed, 1 think it cost ma
almost as much labour as making the
boat.
After all this was done, 1 had my
man Friday to teach as to what be-
longed to the navigation of my boat;
for, though he knew very well how to
paddle a canoe, he knew nothing what
belonged to a sail and a rudder; and was
the most amazed when he saw me
work the boat to and again in the sea
by the rudder, and how the sail gibbed,
and filled this way, or that way, as the
course we sailed changed; 1 say, when
he saw this, he stood like one asto-
nished and amazed. However, with a
little use, I made all these things fami-
liar to him, and he became an expert
sailor, except that as to the compass,
I could make him understand very
little of that. On the other hand, as
there was very little cloudy weather,
and seldom or never any fogs in those
parts, there was the less occasion for
a compass, seeing the stars were always
to be seen by night, and the shore by
day, except in the rainy seasons, and
then nobody eared to stir abroad,
either by land or sea.
I was now entered on the seven and
twentieth year of my captivity in this
place; though the three last years that
I had this creature with me ought ra-
ther to be left out of the account, my
habitation being quite of another kind
than in all the rest of the time. 1 'kept
the anniversary of my landing here
with the same thankfulness to God for
Ms mercies'as at first; and if 1 had
such cause of acknowledgement at
first, I had much more so now, having
such additional testimonies of the care
of Providence over me, and the great
hopes I had of being effectually and
speedily delivered; for 1 had an invin-
cible impression upon my thoughts that
my deliverance was at hand, and that 1
should not be another year in this
flace. I went on, however, with my
usbandry j digging, planting, and
fencing, as usual. 1 gathered and cured
my grapes, and did every necessary
thing as before.  , 
The rainy season was, in the mean
 
II?
 
time, upon me, when I kept more
within doors than at other times, We
had stowed our new vessel as secure as
we could,bringing her up into the creek,
where, as ! said in the beginning, I
landed my rafts from the ship; and
hauling- her up to the i shore, at h%h-
watcr-mark, J made my man Friday
dig a little dock, just big enough to
hold her, and just deep enough to give
her water enough to float in; and then,
when the tide was out, we made a
strong dam across the end of it, to
keep the water out; and so she lay dry,
as to the tide, from the sea; and to
keep the rain off, we laid a great many
boughs of trees, so thick, that she was
as well thatched as a house; and thus
we waited for the months of Novem-
ber and December, in which 1 de-
signed to make my adventure.
"When the settled season began to
come in, as the thought of my design
returned with the fair weather, I was
preparing daily for the voyage: and
the first "thing J did was to lay by a
certain quantity of provisions, being
the stores for our voyage: and intended
in a week or fortnight'9 time to open
the dock, and launch out our I mat.
I was bus? one morning upon some-
thing of this kind, when I called to
Friday, and bid him go to the sea*,
shore, and see if he could find a turtle,
or tortoise, a thing which we generally
got once a week, for the sake of the
eggs as well as the flesh. Friday
had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and lew over my outer-
wail, or fence, like one that felt not
the ground, or the steps he set his feet
on; and before 1 had time to speak to
him, he cries out to me, 0 master! O
master I O sorrow! O bad!——What's
the matter, Friday? says I. O yon-
der, there, says lie, one, two, three ca-
noe; one, two, three! By this way of
speaking, 1 concluded there were six;
but, on inquiry, f found it was but
three. Well, Friday, says I, do not be
frightened! So I heartened him up as
well as I could: however, 1 saw the
poor fellow was most terribly scared;
for nothing ran in hi? head but that
they were come to look for him, and
would cut him in pieces, and eat him;
and the poor fellow trembled so, that
I scarce knew what to do with him. I
comforted him as well as I could, and
told hi in I was in as much clanger as
he, and that they would cat me as well
as him: but says I, Friday, we must
resolve to fight them. Can you fight,
Friday?—Me shoot, says he; but there
come many great number.—No mat-
ter for that, said T, again: our guns
will fright them that we do not kill
So 1 asked him whether, if 1 resolved
to defend him, he would defend me,
and stand by me, and do just as I bid
him. He said, Me die, when you bid
die, master. So I went and fetched a
good dram of rum and gave him; for
1 had been so good a husband of my
rum, that 1 had a great deal left
When he drank it, 1 made him take
the two fowling-pieces, which we
always carried, and loaded them with
large swan-shot, as big as small pistol-
bullets: then I took four muskets, and
loaded them with two slugs, and ive
small bullets each; and my two pistols
I loaded with a brace of bullets each;
1 hung my great sword, as usual, na-
ked by my side, and gave Friday his
hatchet. When 1 had thus prepared
myself, 1 took my perspective-glass,
and went up to the side of the hill, to

quickly, by my glass, that there were
one and twenty savages, three .pri-
soners, and three canoes; and that
their whole business seemed to be the
triumphant banquet upon these three
human bodies; a barbarous feast, in-
deed! but nothing more'than, as I bad
observed, was uiual with them. 1 ob*.

where 'they had done when FViday
made his escape, but nearer to my

horrence of the inhuman errand these
wretches came about, tiled roe with
such indignation, that 1 came down
again to Friday, and tolcl him' I was
resolved to go down to them, and.kill

ADVJSNT-URBS OF
 
 
In t|«s" It of fury, 1 took and divided
the arins which 1 had charged, as be-
fore, between us; 1 gave Friday one
pistol to stick in hi» girdle, and'thrce
guns upon his shoulder; and 1 took
one pistol, and the other three guns
jrnytielf § and in this posture we
inarched out. I took a small bottle of
nun in my pocket, and gave Friday a
ifirge bag with more powder and bul-
lets; ana, as to orders, 1 charged him
to keep close behind me, and not to
stir, or shoot, or do any thing, till 1
bid him; and, in the mean time not to
speak a word. In this posture, I
fetched a coin pass to my right hand of
near a mile, as well to get over the.
cxeek as to get into the wood, so that I
might come within shot of them before'
I should be discovered, which I had
seen, by my glass it was easy to do.
While I was making this march, imy
former thoughts returning, I began to-
abate my resolution; I do not mean
that I entertained any fear of their
number; for as they were naked, un-
armed wretches, it is certain 1 was su-
perior to them; nay, though I had
been alone. But it occurred to my
thoughts, what call, what occasion,
much less what necessity I was in, to
go and dip my hands in blood, to at-
tack people who had neither done or
intended me any wrong I Who, m to
Hie, were innocent, and whose barba-
rous customs were their* own disaster;
being, in them, a token indeed of
Oofl's having left them, with the other
nations of that part of the world, to
such stupidity, and to -such inhuman
courses; but did not call roe to take
Upon me to he a judge of their actions-,
much less an executioner of his jus-
tice; that, whenever he thought fit, he
wpuld take the cause into his own
bands, and, by national vengeance, pu-
nish them, as a people, for national
crimes -9 but that, in the mean time, it
was none of my business; that, It was
true, Friday might justify itf because
lie was a declared enemy, and in a
state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to
/attack them; but 1 could not say the
same with respect to myself. These
things were so warmly pressed upon
ipy thoughts ail the way as I went",
that 1 resolved I would ..only go and
place myself near them, that 1 might
observe their barbarous feast, and that
! would act then as God should direct;
but that, unless something offered that
was more a call to mc than yet I knew
of, I would not meddle with them.
With this resolution I entered the
wood; and, with all possible wariness
and silence, Friday following close at
my heck, I marched till I came to the
skirt of the wood, on the side which
was next to them, only that one corner
of the wood lay between me and them.
Here I called softly to Friday, and
showing him a great tree, which was just
at the corner of the wood, I bade nun
go to the tree, and bring me word if lie
could see there plainly what they were
doing, lie did so; and came immedi-
ately back to me, and told me they
might be plainly viewed there; that
they were ail about their fire, eating
the flesh of one of their prisoners, and
that another lay bound upon the sand,
a little from them, which, he said, they
would kill next, and which fired all the
very soul within me. He told me it
was not one of their nation, but one of
the bearded men he had told me of,
that came to their country in the boat.
I was filled with horror at the very
naming the white bearded man; and,
going to the tree, 1 saw plainly, by my
fiass, a white roan, who lay upon the
each of the sea, with his hands and
his feet tied with flags, or things like
rashes, and that he was an European,
and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little
thicket beyond it, about fifty yards
nearer to them than /the place where
I was, which, by going a little way
about, .1 saw 1 might come at undisco-
vered, and that then I should be within
half a shot of them: so I withheld my
passion, though 1 was indeed enraged
to the highest degree; and going back
about twenty paces, I got behind
some bushes, which held all the way
till I came to the other tree; and then
came to a little rising ground, which
gave me a full view or them, at the
distance of about eighty yards,
I had now not a moment to lose, for
nineteen of the dreadful wretches sat
upon the ground, all close huddled to-
iii
getlicr, and had just seat the other two
to butcher the poor Christian, and
bring1 him, perhaps, limb by limb, to
their fire; and they were stooping
down to 'Uiitie the bands at his feet,
1 turned to Friday-—Now Friday, said
I, do as I bill thee. Friday said lie
would. Then, Friday, says I, do
exactly as you see me do; foil in
nothing. So 1 set down one .of the
muskets and the fowling-piece upon
the ground, and Friday did the like by
his; and with the other musket I
took my aim at the savages, bidding
Mm to do the like; then asking him
if he was ready, he said, Yes* Then
lire at them, said 1; and the same mo-
ment 1 tired also,
Friday took his aim so much better
than f, that on the side that he shot,
lie killed two of them, and wounded
three more; and on my side, 1 killed
one, and wounded two. They were,
yon may be sure, in a dreadful con-
sternation; and ail of them who were
not hurt jumped upon their feet, but
did not immediately know which way
to run, or which way to look, for they
knew not from whence their destruc-
tion came. Friday kept bis eyes close
upon me that, as i had bid him, he
might observe what I did; so, as soon
aajthe first shot was made, 1 threw down
the piece, and took up the fowling-
piece, and Friday did the like: he saw
ine cock and present; he did the same
again. Are you ready, Friday r said I.
—Yea, says he. 'Let fly, then, says 1,
in the name of God! aid with that, 1
Ired again among the amazed wretches,
and so did Friday; and as our pieces
were now loadeh with what 1 called
swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we
found only two drop, but so many
were wounded, that they ran about
yelling and screaming like mad crea-
tures, all bloody, and most of them
miserably wounded, whereof three
more fcfl quickly after, though not
quite dead.
t Now Friday, says 1, laying down the
.discharged pieces, and taking up the
musket which was yet loaden, follow
me; which he did, with a great ileal
of courage; upon which 1 rushed out
of ^ the wood, and showed myself, and
Friday close, at my foot As soon as!
perceived they saw me* I shouted as
loud as I could, and bade Friday do so
too; and running as fast as 1 could,
which, by the way, was not very fast,
being loaded with arms m 1 was, I
I made directly towards the. poor
victim, who was, as 1 said, lying upon
the beach, or shore, between the place
where they sat and the sea. The two
butchers, who were just going to work
with him, had left him at the surprise
of our first fire, and led in a terrible
fright to the sea-side, and had jumped
Into a canoe, and three more of the
rest made the same way. 1 turned to
Friday, and bade him step forwards,
and lire at them; he understood me
immediately, and running about forty
yards, to be nearer them, he shot at
them, and 1 thought he had killed
them all, for 1 saw them all fail of a
heap into the boat, though 1 saw two
of them up again quickly: however,
he killed two of them, and woundfd
the third so, that he lay down in the
bottom of the boat as if he had been
dead.
While my man Friday fired at them,
1 pulled out my knife and cut the flap
that bound the poor victim; and loos-
ing his hands anil feet, 1 lifted him up,
and asked him in the Portuguese
tongue, what he was. He answered in
Latin, Christianus j but was so week
and faint that he could scarce stand or
speak* 1 took my bottle out of my
pocket, and gave it him, making signis
that he should drink, which lie clidj
and 1 gave him a piece of bread, which
he eat. Then I asked him what
countryman lie was: and he said,
Espagniole; and being it little re-
covered let me know, by all the signs
he could possibly make, how much he
was in my debt for his deliverance.
Seignior, said I, with as much Spanish
as 1 could make up, we will talk after-
wards, hut we must fight now: if you
have any strength left, take this pistol
and sword, and lay about you. He
took them very thankfully; and no
sooner had he the arms in his liands>
but, as if they had put new vigour into
.him, he flew upon his murderers like
a fury, and had cut two. of them in
pieces in an instant; for the truth,is,
as tie whole was a surprise to them*
 
 
ADVENTURES-OF
 
so the poor creatures were so much
frightened with the noise of our pieces,
that they full down for mere amaze-
ment and fear, and had no more
power to attempt their own escape,
than their flesh had to resist our shot:
and that was the case of those fire that
'Friday shot at In the boat; for as
three of them fell with the hurt they
received, so the other two fell with the
fright,
1 kept iny piece in my hand still
without firing-, being willing to keep
ray charge ready, because I'had given
the Spaniard my pistol and sword: so
I called to Friday, and bade him run
iip to the tree from whence we first
fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there that had been discharged, which
lie did with great swiftness; and then
giving him my miukct, 1 sat clown
Myself to load all the rest again, and
hade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these
pieces, there happened a fierce en-
gagement between, the Spaniard and
one of the savages, who made at him
with one of their great wooden swords,
the same-like weapon that was to have
killed him before, if 1 had not pre-
sented it. Tlie Spaniard, who was as
bold and brave as could be Imagined,
though weak, had fought this Indian
4 good while, and had cut him two
great wounds on his head; but the
savage beiinj a stout, lusty fellow,
closing in with him, had thrown him
down, being faint, and was' wringing
jtiy sword out of his hand; when the
Spaniard though undermost, wisely
quitting the sword, drew the pistol
from, his girdle, shot .the savage
through the body, and killed him
upon the spot, before I, who was
running to help him, could come near
him.
, Friday being now left to his liberty,
pursued the flying wretches, with no
weapon in his hand but his batehet;
ami with that he dispatched those
three, who, m 1 said before, were
wounded at first, and fallen, and all
the Test he could come up with: and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun,
1 gave him one of the fowling pieces,
- with which he pursued two of the
savages, and wounded them bothj
but, as he was not able to run, they
both got from him into the wood,
where Friday pursued them, ami
killed one of them, but the other was
too nimble for him; and though he
was wounded, yet had plunged himself
into the sea, and swum, with all his
might, off to those two who were left
iii the canoe, which three in the canoe,
with one wounded, that we knew not
whether he died or no, were all that
escaped our hands of one and twenty;
the account of the whole h as fol-
lows: three killed at our first shot
from the tree; two killed at the next
shot; two killed b? Friday in the
boat; two killed by Friday of those at
first wounded; one killed'by Friday in
the wood j three killed" by the
Spaniard; four killed, being found
dropped here and there, of their
wounds, or killed by Friday in his
chase of them; four escaped in the
boat, whereof one wounded, if not
dead.'—Twenty-one in all.
Those that were in the canoe worked
hard to get out of gun-shot, and
though Friday made two or three shots
at them, 1 did not find that he hit any
of them. Friday would fain have had
me take one of their canoes, and pur-
sue ^ them; and indeed, 1 was very
anxious about their escape, lest car-
rying the news home to their people,
they should come back perhaps with
two or three hundred of the canoes,
and devour us by mere multitude 5 so
I consented to pursue them by sea,
and running to one of their canoes, I
jumped in, and bade Friday follow me;
but when I was in the canoe, 1 was
surprised to find another poor creature
lie there, bound hand and foot, as the
Spaniard was, for the slaughter, and
almost dead with fear, not knowing
what was the matter; for lie had not
been able to look up over the side of
the boat, he was tied so hard neck
and heels, and had been tied so long,
that he had really but little life in him.
I immediately cut the twisted flags
or rushes, which they had bound him
with, and would have helped him up;
but he could not stand or speak, but
groaned most pitcously, believing, it
seems, still, that he was only unbound
in order to be killed. When Friday
 
121
 
 
titroc to'him, 1 bade him speak to him,
ami tell him of his deliverance; and,
pulling* out my bottle, made him give
the poor wretch a dram 5 which, with
the news of his being delivered, re-
vived hint, and he sat up in the boat.
But when Friday came to hear him
sfieak, and look in his face, it would
have moved any one to tears to have
seen how Friday kissed him, cm-
braced him, hugged him,eried, laughed,
holloed, jumped about, danced, sung j
then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat hi-* own face and head; and then
anng and jumped about again, like a
distracted creature. It was a good
while before I could make him speak
to me, or tell rne what was the matter;
but when he came a little to himself,
lie told me that it was his father.
It is not easy for me to express
how it moved ine to see what ecstasy
and filial affection had worked in this
poor savage at the sight of his father,
and of his being delivered from death;
nor, indeed, can I describe half the
extravagancies of his affection after
this; tor he went into the bout, and
out of the boat, a great many times:
when he went into him, he would sit
clown by him, open his breast, and
hold his father's head dose to his
bosom for many minutes together, to
nourish it; then he took his arms
and ancles, which were numbed and
stiff with the binding, and chafed and
rubbed them with his hands 5 and I,
perceiving what the case was, gave
hi 111 some fum out of my bottle to
nil) them with, which did them a great
deal of good.
This affair put an end to our pur-
suit of the canoe with the other sa-
vages, who were now got almost out
of sight; and it was happy for us that
we did not, for it blew so'hard within
two hours after, and before they could
be got a quarter of their way, and
continued blowing so hard all'night,
and that from the north-west, wfiich
was against them, that I  could not
suppose their boat could live, or that
they ever reached their own coast.
lint, to return to Friday; he was so
busy about his father, that I could not
find in my heart to take Mm off for
some time: but after I thought he
could leave him a little, I culled hiiii
to me, and he came jumping and
laughing, and pleased to the highest
extreme j then I asked him if he had
given his father any bread. He shook
his head, and said, None; ugly dog
eat all up self, I then gave him 11
rake of bread, out of a little pouch I
carried on purpose; I also gave him a
dram for himself, but he would not
taste it, but carried it to his father. I
had in my pocket two or three bunches
of raisins, so I gave him a handful of
them for Ms father. He had 110 sooner
given his father these raisins, but 1
saw him come out of the boat, and
run away, as if he had been bewitched,
lie ran at such a rate; for he was the
swiftest fellow on his feet that ever I
saw: I say, he ran at such a rate, that
he was out of sight, as it were, in an
instant; and though I called, and hol-
loed out too, after him, it was all
one, away he went j and in a quarter
of an hour I saw him come back
again, though not so fast as he went;
and as he came nearer, I found his
pace slacker, because he had some-
thing in his hand. When he came up
to me, I found he had been quite
home for an earthern jug, or pot, to
bring his father some fresh water, and
that he had two more cakes or loaves
of bread; the bread he gave me, but
the water he carried to' Ms father;
however, as I was very thirsty too, I
took a little sup of it. The water re-
vived his father more than all the rum
or spirits I had given him, for he was
just fainting with thirst.
When his father had drank, I called
to him to know if there was any
water left: lie said, Yes; and I' bade
him give it to the poor Spaniard, who
was "in as much want of it as his
father; and I sent one of the cakes
that Friday brought to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and
was reposing himself upon a green
place under the shade of a tree; and
whose limbs were also very stiff, and
very much swelled with the rude
bandage he had been tied with. When
I saw that upon Friday's coining to
him with the water, he sat up and
drank, and took the bread, and began
to cat, I went to him and gave him a
 
ADVENTURES OF
 
handful of raisins: he looked up in
my face with all the tokens of gra-
titude and thankfulness thai could ap-
pear in any countenance; but was so
weak* notwithstanding lie had so ex-
erted himself in the fight, that he
could not stand tip :upon his feet; he
tried to do it two or three times, hut
was really not able, his ancles were
so swelled and so painful to Mm; so
1 hade him sit still, and caused Friday
to ruh Ms ancles, and hathe them
with rum,* us he had clone his father's*
1 observed the poor affectionate
creature, ,every two minutes, or per-
haps less, all the while he was here,
turn his head about, to see if his father
wan in the same place and posture as
he left him sitting'; and at last he
found he was not to he seen; at wh\ch
he started up, and, without speaking a
word, flew with that swiftness to him,
that one could scarce perceive his
feet to touch the ground as he went:
hut when he came, he only found he
had laid himself down to ease his
limbs, so Friday came hack to me pre-
sently; and then I spoke to the
Spaniard to let Friday help him up,
if he could, and lead him to the boat,
and then he should carry him t© our
dwelling, where 1 would take care of
him:,, but Friday, a lusty strong fel-
low, took the Spaniard quite up upon
his back, and carried him away to the
boat,' and set him down .softly upon
the side or gunnel of the canoe, with
Ms feet |in the inside of it 3 and then
lifting him quite in, he set him close
to his father$ and presently stepping1
out again, launched the boat off, and
f addled it along the shore faster than
, could walk, though the wind blew
pretty hard too: so he brought them
both safe into our creek, and leaving
them in the boat, ran away to fetch
the other canoe. As he passed me, 1
spoke to him, and asked him whither
he went. He told me, Go fetch more
boat: so away he went like the wind,
for sure never man or horse ran like
him; and he had the other canoe in
the creek almost as soon as 1 got to
it by land j so he wafted me over, and
then went to help our new guests out
of the boat, which he did 5 but  they
were neither of them able to walk,
so that poor Friday , knew not what
to do.
To remedy this, 1 went to .work in
my thought, and calling to Friday to
bid them sit, clown on the bank while
he came to me, 1 soon made a kind of
a hand barrow to lay them on, and Fri-
day and I carried them both up toge-
ther upon it, between us. But when
we got them to the outside of our wall,
or fortification, we were at a worse loss
than before, for it was impossible to
get them over, and 1 was resolved not
to break it down; so I set to work
again; and Friday and I, in about two
hours' time, made a very handsome tent,
covered with old sails, and above that
with boughs of trees, being in the
space without our outward fence, and
between that and the grove of young
wood which 1 had planted; and here
we made them two beds of such things
as I had, viz. of good rice-straw, with
blankets laid upon it, to Me on, and
another to cover them, on each bed.
My island was now peopled, and I
thought myself very rich in subjects;
and ft was a merry reflection, which, I
frequently made, how like a king 1
looked. First of all* the wtiole coun-
try was my own mere property, so that
1^ had an undoubted right of domi-
nion. Secondly, my people were-per-
fectly subjected j as I was absolutely
lord and law-giver j they all owed their
lives to me, and were ready to lay
down their lives, if there had been oc-
casion for it, for me* It was remark-
able, too, 1 had but three subjects, and
they were of three different religions:
my man Friday was a protestant, his
father was a pagan and a cannibal, <and
the Spaniard was a papist 5 however, I
allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions:—but this is by the
way.
As soon as 1 had secured my two
weak rescued prisoners, and given them
shelter, and a place to rest them upon,
I began to think of making some pro-
vision for them; and the first thing i
did, I ordered Friday to take ji yearling
goat, betwixt a kid .and a goat, out
of my particular flock, to be killed;
when 1 cut off the hinder quarter, and
chopping it into small pieces, I set Fri-
day to work to boiling and stewing, and
 
 
123-
 
made them a very good dish, 1 assure
you, of flesh and broth, having put
some barley and rice also into ihe
broth: und as 1 cooked it without-doors,
for i made no lire within my inner
ivail, so 1 carried it all into the new
! cat, and having set a table there for
them, I sat down, and cat my dinner
also with them, and as well as f could,
cheered them, and encouraged them.
Friday was my interpreter, especially
to his father, and, indeed, to the Spa-
niard too; for Ihe Spaniard spoke the
language of the savages pretty well.
After we had diued, or rather supped,
I ordered Friday to take one of the
canoes, and go and fetch our muskets
and other fire-arms, which, for want of
time, we had left upon the place of
battle: and, the next day, 1 ordered
him to go and bury the dead bodies of
the savages, which lay open to the sun,
and would presently be offensive. I
also ordered them to bury the horrid
remains of their barbarous feast, which
I knew were pretty much, and which
1 could not think of doing myself; nay,
I could not bear to see them, if 1 went
that way; all which he punctually per-
formed, and effaced the very appearance
of the savages being there; ho that
when I went again,! could scarce know
where it was, otherwise than by the
corner of the wood pointing to the
place.
I then began to enter into a -little
conversation with my two new subjects:
iim% first, I set Friday to iuquirc of
lik father what lie thought of the es-
cape of the savages in that canoe, and
whether we might expect a return of
them, wich a power too great for its to
resist. His first opinion was, that th/s
savages in the boat never could live out
the storm which blew that night they
went off, but must, of necessity, be
drowned, or driven south to those other
shores, where they were as sure to be
devoured as they were to be drowned,
if they were cast away: but, m to what
they would do, if they came safe on
shore, he said he knew not: but it was his
opinion, that they were so dreadfully
frightened with, the manner of their
being'attacked, the noise, and the Ire,
that lie believed they would tell the
people they were all killed by thunder
and lightning, not bv the hand of hmui v
and that the two wliich appeared, viss.
Friday and I, were two heavenly spirits,
or furies, come down to destroy them,.
and not men with weapons, 'f his,  ho
said, he knew; because he heard them
all cry out so, in their language, one to
another j'for it was impossible for them
to conceive that a man could dart lire,
and speak thunder, and kill at a ins-
tance, without lifting up the hand, as
was done now: and this old savage
was in the right; for, m I understood
since, by other hands, the savages ne-
ver attempted to go over to the island
afterwards, they were so terrified with
the accounts given by those four men
(for, it seems, they did escape the sea),
that they believed whoever went to
that enchanted island would be des-
troyed with fire from the gods. This,
however, 1 knew not; and therefore
was under continual apprehensions for
a good while, and kept always upon
my guard, with all my army: for, an
there were now four of us, 1 would
have ventured upon a hundred of
them, fairly in the open field, at any
time.
In a little time, however, no more
canoes appearing, the fear of their
coining wore off; and I began to take
my former thoughts of a voyage to
the 'main into consideration; being
likewise assured, by Friday's father!
that 1 might depend upon good usage
from their nation on his account, if I
would go. But my thoughts were a
little suspended whew 1 had a serious
discourse with the Spaniard, and when.
I understood that there were sixteen
more of his countrymen and Portuguese^
who, having been caft away, and made
their escape to that side, lived there at
peace, indeed, with the savages, "but
were very sore put to it for necessaries,
and indeed for life. 1 asked him for
all the particulars of their voyage, and
found they were a Spanish ship,'bound
from the Bio de la Plata to the Ha van-
uati, being directed to leave their load-
ing there, which was chiefly hide* and
sliver, and to bring back what European
goods they could meet with there; that
they had five Portuguese seamen on
board, whom they took out of another
wreck; that five of their own men were
 
 
ADVENTURES OF
 
drowned, when first the ship was lost,
and. that these escaped, through infinite
clangers and hazards, and arrived, al-
most; stm*?ed, on the cannibal coast,
where they expected to have been de-
voured erery moment. He told me
they had some arms with them, but
they were perfectly useless, for that
they had neither powder or ball, the
washing of the sea having spoiled all
their powder, but a little, which they
used, at their first landing, to provide
themselves some food.
1 asked him what he thought would
become of them there, and if they had
formed no design of making any es-
cape, He said they had many con-
sultations about it; but that Wing
neither vessel, nor tools to build one,
nor provisions of any kind, their coun-
cils always ended in tears and despair,
i asked him how lie thought they would
receive a proposal from me, which
might tend towards an escape; and
whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done. 1 told him with freedom,
I feared mostly their treachery and ill
usage of me, if 1 put my life In their
hands; for that gratitude was no in-
herent virtue in the nature of man, nor
did men always square their dealings
by the obligations they had received,
so much as they did by the advantages
they expected. !tola him it would be
very hard that 1 should be the instru-
ment of their 'deliverance, and that
they should afterwards make me their
prisoner in New Spain, where an En-
glishman was certain lo be made a sa-
crifice, what necessity, or what acci-
dent soever brought him thither; and
that 1 had rather be delivered up to the
savages, and be devoured alive, than
fall into the merciless^ claws of the
priests, and be carried into the Inqui-
sition* 1 added, that otherwise 1 was
persuaded, if they were all here, we
might, with so many hands, build a
bark large enough to carry us all away,
either to the Brazils, southward, or to
the islands, or Spanish coast, north-
ward; but that if, in requital, they
should, when I had put weapons into
their hands, carry roe by force among
their own people, ! might be ill used for
my Madness to them, and make my ease
worse than it was before.
He answered, with a great 'deal .of
candour and ingenuousness, that their
condition was so miserable, and' that
they were so sensible of it, that, he
believed, they would abhor the thought
of using any man unkindly that should
contribute to their deliverance j and that
if! pleased, he would go to them with
the old man, and discourse with them
about it,* and return again, and bring
me their answer; that he would make
conditions with them upon their solemn
oath that they should be absolutely un-
der my leading, as their commander
and cajitain; and that they should swear
upon the holy sacraments and gospel,
to be trite to me, and go'to such chris-
tian country as that 1 should agree to,
and no other, and to be directed wholly
and absolutely by my orders, till'they
were landed safely in such country as
I intended; and that he would bring a
contract from them, under their hands,
for that purpose. Then he told me
he would first swear to me himself,
that he would never-stir from me as
long as he lived, till I gave him or-
ders; and that he would take my side,
to the last drop of his blood, if there
should happen the least breach of faith
among his countrymen. He told me
they were all of them very civil, honest
men, and they were under the greatest
distress imaginable, having neither wea-
pons or clothes, nor any food, but at
the mercy and discretion of the sa-
vages; out of all hopes of ever re-
turning to their own country; and
that he was sure, if I would under-
take their relief, they would live aid
die by me.
Upon these assurances, I resolved
to venture to relieve them, if possible,
and to send the old savage and this Spa-
niard over to them to treat. But when
we had got all things in readiness to
go, the Spaniard himself started an ob-
jection, which had so much prudence
in it, on one hand, and so much sin-
cerity, on the other hand, that 1 could
not but be very well satisfied in it;
and, by Ms advice, put off the deliver-
ance of his comrades for at least half
a yean The case was thus: he had
been with us now about a month, du-
ring which time 1 had let him see in
what manner I had provided, with the
 
 
 
m
 
 
assistance of Providence, for my sup-
port; and he saw evidently what stuck
of corn and rice I had laid up; which,
though it was more than sufficient for
myself, yet it was not sufficient, with-
out good husbandry, for my family,
now it win iiKTeiwerf to four; but much
less would it be sufficient if his coun-
trymen, who were, as lie said,, sixteen,
still alive, should come over; and
least of all, would it be sufficient to
victual our vessel, if we should, build
one, for a voyage to any of the chris-
tian colonies of' America; so he told
me lie thong lit it would be more ad-
visable to let him and the other two dig"
and cultivate some more land, as much
as I could spare seed to sow, and that
we should wait another harvest, that
we might have a supply of corn for Ills
countrymen, when they should come;
for want might be a temptation to them
to disagree, or not to think themselves
delivered, otherwise than out of one
difficulty into another. You know,
says he, the'children of Israel, though
they rejoiced at first for their being de-
livered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even
against God himself, that delivered
them, when they came to want bread
In the wilderness.
His caution was so seasonable, and
his advice so good that 1 could not but
be very well pleased with his proposal,
as well as 1 was satisfied with his fide-
lity: so we fell to digging, all four of
us, as well as the wooden took we
were furnished with permitted; and in
about a month's time, by the end of
which it was seed-time, we had got as
much land cured and trimmed up as
we sowed two and twenty bushels of
barley on, and sixteen jars of rice;
which was, in short, all the seed we
had to spare; nor, indeed, did we leave
ourselves barley sufficient for our own
food, for the six months that we bad to
expect our crop; that |s to say, reckon-
ing from the time we set our seed aside
for sowing; for it is not to be supposed
it is six months in the ground in that
country.
Having now society enough, and our
number being sufficient to put us out
of fear of the savages, if they had come,
unless their number had been very
great, we went freely all over  the
island, whenever we found occasion;
and as here we had our escape, or de*
Hverance, upon our thoughts, it was
impossible, at least for me, to have the
means of it out of mine* For this pur-
pose, 1 marked out several trees which
I thought lit for our work, and I .set
Friday "'and his father to cutting them
down; and then 1 caused the Spaniard,
to whom 1 imparted my thought on
that affair, to oversee and direct their
work. 1 showed them with what inde-
fatigable pains 1 had hewed a large tree
into single planks, and I caused them to
do the like, till they had made about a
dozen large planks of good oak, near
two feet broad, thirty-live feet long, and
from two inches to four inches thick:
what prodigious labour it took up, any
one may Imagine,
At the same time, f contrived to in-
crease my bttle lock of tame goats an
much at I could; and, for this purpose
1 made Friday and the Spaniard go out
one day, and myself with Friday the
next clay (for we took our turns)* and
by this means we got about twenty
young kids to breed up with the rest;
for whenever we shot the dam, we saved
the kids, and added them to our flock.
But, above ail, the season for curing
the grapes coming on, I caused such a
prodigious quantity to be hung up in
the sun, that, 1 believe, had we been
at Alieant, where the raisins of the
sun are cured, we could have filled
sixty or eighty barrels; and these,
with our bread, was a great part of
our food, and %ms very good living too,
1 assure you, for it is exceeding nou-
rishing,
It was now harvest, and our crop in
good order: it was not the most plenti-
ful increase 1 had seen in the island,
but, however, it was enough to answer
our end; for from twenty-two bushels
of barley we brought in and threshed
out above two hundred and twenty
bushels, and the like in proportion of
the riee; which was store enough for
our fowl to the next harvest, though all
the sixteen Spaniards had been on
shore with me; or if we had been ready
for a voyage, it would very plentifulty
have victual led our ship to have car-
ried us to any part of the world, that is
to say, any part of America.' When
 
 
 
 
 
ADVENTURES OP
 
 
we had thus housed and secured our
magazine of corn, we fell to' work to
make more wicker-ware, vk. great bas-
kets, in which we kept ft; and the
%»tikrd was very handy and dexterous
at this part, and often blamed me that
1 did not make some things for defence
of thin kind of work; bat I saw no need
of it.
And now hating1 a full supply of
food for all the guests I expected,!
gave the Spaniard leave to go over to
the main, to see what lie could do with
those he had left behind them there.
I gave him a strict charge not to bring
any man with him who "would not first
awear, in the presence of himself and
the old savage, that lie would no way
Injure, fight with, or attack the per-
son lie should find in the island, who
•was so kind as to send for them, in
•order to their deliverance; but that
they would stand by him, and defend
hmi against all such attempts, and
wherever they went, would be entirely
under and subjected to his command;
md that-this should be put in writing,
and signed with their hands. How
they were to have done this, when!
knew they had neither pen nor ink,
was a question which we never asked.
Under these instructions, the Spaniard
and the old savage, the father of Fri-
day, went away in one of the canoes
which they might be said to come in,
or 'wither wer* brought in, when they
came as prisoners to' be devoured by
the savages. I gave each of them a
musket, with a 'firelock on it, [and
about eight charges of ponder and
ball, charging them to be very good
husbands of both, and not to use ei-
ther of them but upon urgent occa-
sions.
This was a cheerful work, being the
first measures used by me, in view of
my deliverance, for now twenty-seven
years and some days. I gave them
provisions of bread, and of dried grapes,
sufficient for themselves for many da?s,
tod sufficient for all the Spaniards for
About eight days* time; and wishing
'them ft' good voyage, 1 saw them go;
agreeing with them about a signal they
should "hang outsat' their return, by
which 1 should know them again, when
'they came 'backj at a distance before
they came on shore. They went away
with a fair gale, on the day that the
moon was at full, by my account, in
the month of October$ but m for an
exact reckoning of clays, after 1 had
once lost it, f could never recover It
again; nor had ! kept even the num-
ber of years so punctually as to be sure
I was right; though, as it proved,
when 1 afterwards examined my ac-
count, 1 found I had kept a true reckon-
ing of years.
It was no less than eight days 1 had
waited for them, when "a strange and
unforeseen accident intervenedjOf which
the like lias not perhaps been heard of
in history. I was fast asleep in my
hutch one morning, when my man
Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, Blaster, muster, they are
come, they are come! 1 jumped up,
and, regardless of danger,* ! went out,
as soon as I could get my clothes on,
through my little grove, which, by the
way, was by this time grown to *be a
very thick wood; I say, regardless of
'danger, 1 went without * my anus,
which was not my custom to do: but
I was surprised, when turning my eyes
to the sea, 1 presently saw a" boat at
about a league and a half distance,
standing in for the shore, with a shoul-
der-6f-tnutton sail, as'they call it, and
the wind blowing pretty fair to 'bring
them in: also I observed presently
that they did not come from that side
which the shore lay on, but from the
southernmost end of the island. Upon
this, !called Friday in, and bade fiini
lie close, for these were not the people
we looked for, and that we might not
know yet whether they were friends or
enemies. In the next place, I went in
to fetch my perspective-glass, to sec
what I coiila make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbed
up to the top of the lull, as 1 used to
do when I was apprehensive of any
thing, and to take my view' the plainer,
without being discovered. I had scarce
set my foot upon the hill, when my eye
plainly discovered a ship lying at an
anchor, at about two leagues and a
half distance from me, S. S. E.'bnt not
above a league and a half from the
shore. By my observation, it appeared
plainly to be an English ship, and the
 
127
 
boat appeared to be an English long-
boat
1 cannot express the confusion 1 was
in; though the joy of seeing a ship,
anil one that I had reason to believe
was manned by my own countrymen,
mid consequently mends, was such as
I cannot describe; but yet 1 had some
secret doubts hung about me, 1 cannot
tell frooi whence they came, bidding
me keep upon my guard. In the first
place* it occurred to me to consider
what business an English ship could
have in that part of the world, since it
was not the way to or from any part of
the world where the English had any
traffic; and 1 knew there had been no
storms to drive them in there, as in
distress; and that if they were really
English, it was most probable that
they were here upon no good design;
and that 1 had better continue as I
was, than fall into the hands of thieves
and murderers.
Let no man despise the secret hints
and notices of danger, which some-
times are given hint when he may think
there is no possibility of its being real.
That such hints and notices arc" given
us, 1 believe few that have made any
observations of things can deny; that
they are certain discoveries of an invi-
sible world, and a converse of spirits,
we cannot doubt; and if the tendency of
them seems to be to,warn ns of dan-
ger,, why should we not suppose they
are from some friendly agent (whether
supreme, or inferior and subordinate,
is not the question), and that they are
given for our good?
The present question abundantly
confirms me in the justice of this rea-
soning; for had ! not been made cau-
tious by this secret admonition, come
it from whence it will, 1 had been un-
done inevitably, and in a far worse con-
dition than before, as you will see pre-
sently, I had not kept myself long in
this posture, but 1 saw the boat draw
near the shore, as if they looked for a
creek to thrust in at, for the conve-
nience of landing; however, as they
did not come quite far enough, they
did not see the little inlet where 1 for-
merly landed my rafts, but ran their
boat on .shore upon the beach, at
about half a mile from roe, which was
 
very happy for me; for otherwise they
would have landed just at my door, as
1 may say, and would soon hate beaten
me out o*f my castle, and perhaps have
plundered me of all 1 had. When
they were on shore, 1 was fully satis-
fied they were Englishmen, at least
most of them; one' or two I thought
were Dutch, but it did not prove "so;
there were in all eleven men, whereof
three of them I found wore unarmed,
and, as I thought, bound; and when
the first four or five of them were
jumped on shore, they took those three
out of the boat, as prisoners: one of the
three 1 could perceive using the most
passionate gesture* of entreaty, aillic-
tion, and despair, even to a kind of ex-
travagance; the other two, I could
perceive, lifted up their hands some-
times, and appeared concerned, indeed,
but not to such a degree as the 'first
1 was perfectly confounded at the
sight, and knew not what the meaning
of it should be. Friday called out to
me in English as well as he could, O
master! you see English roans eat pri-
soner as well as savage mans.—rWliy,
Friday, says 1, do you think they are
going to cat them then?—Yes, says
frriday, they will eat them.—No, no,
says I, Friday $ 1 am afraid they will
murder them, indeed, but you may be
sure they will not cat them.
All this while 1 had no thought of
what the matter really*was, but stood
trembling with the horror of the sight,
expecting every moment when "the
three prisoners should be killed; nay,
once 1 saw one of the villains lift up
his arm with a great cutlass, as the
seamen call it, or sword, to strike one
of the poor men; and I expected to
see him fall every moment; at which
all the blood in my body seemed to
run chill in rny veins. 1 wished hear-
tily now for my Spaniard, and the sa-
vage that was gone with him, or that J.
had any way to have come undisco-
vered within shot of  tliem, 'that 1
might have rescued the three men,, for
1 saw no fire-arms they had among
them; but it fell out to my mind .ano-
ther way. After I had observed the
outrageous usage of the three men by
the insolent seamen, i observed the
fellows ran scattering about .the island.

ADVENTURES .OF
 
tilnie that he.was able* but offered to
•be wholly guided by me. I told him 1
thought it was hard venturing any thing,
but. the best method 1 could think of
was to fire upon them at once, as they
lay, and if way were not killed at the
first volley, and offered to submit, we
might save them, and so put it wholly
upon God's providence to direct the
shot. He said very modestly, that he
was loath to kill them, if he could help
it; but that those two were incorrigi-
ble villains, and had been the authors
of all the mutiny in the ship, and if
they escaped, we should be undone
still j for they would go on board and
bring the whole ship's company, and
destroy us all Well then, says I,
necessity legitimates my advice* for it
is the only way to save our lives. How-
ever, seeing him still cautions of shed-
ding blood, I told him they should go
themselves and manage as they found
convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we
heard some of them awake, and soon
after we saw two of them on their feet.
1 asked him if either of them were the
'heads of the mutiny? He said no.'
Weil then, said I, you may let them
escape; and Providence seems to have
awakened them on purpose to save
themselves* Now, says I, if the rest
escape yon, it is your fault. Animated
with this, he took the musket 1 had
given him in his hand, and a, pistol in
his belt, and his two comrades with.
him, with each a piece in his hand;
the two men who were with Mm going
first, made some noise, at which one of
the seamen who was awake turned
about* »nd seeing them coining, cried
out,to the rest; but it was too late
then, „ for the moment, he cried
out they fired; I mean the two men,
the captain wisely reserving  his own
piece*: ..They had so well aimed their
shot at the men they .knew, that
#pe „of them was .killed on the spot,,
and 'the other very much wounded;
bit .notbeing dead he started up on his
(mh and called eagerly for help to the
Other-; but .the  captain stepping to
histoid, him it was too late to cry for
help* he, should call upon God to. for-
fflp#4is,,viliamyi and, with,that w<wd
flocked him. .down, with the 'stock of
his .musket* so that he ntver spoke
more; there were three more in.<-the
company, and one of them was. also
slightly "wounded. By this time I was-
come; and when they taw their dan-
ger, and that it was in vain to resist,
they begged for mercy* The captain
told them he would spare their lives,
if they would give him any assurance
of their abhorrence of the treachery
they had been guilty of, and would
swear to be faithful to him in recover-
ing the ship, and afterwards in carry-
ing her back to Jamaica, from whence
they came. They gave him all the
protestations of their sincerity that
could be desired, and he was willing to
believe them, and spare their lives,
which I was not against, only that 1
obliged him to keep them hound hand
and foot while they were on the island.
While this was doing, 1 sent Friday
with the captain's mate to the boat,
with orders to secure her, and bring
away the oars and sails, which they
did: and by and by three straggling
men, that were (happily for them)
parted from the rest, came back upon
hearing the guns fired, and seeing the
captain, who before was their prisoner,
now their conqueror, they submitted
to be bound also j and so our victory
was complete.
It now remained that the captain and
1 should inquire Into one another's cir-
cumstances: I began first, and told him
my whole history, which he heard .with
an attention even to amazement.; and
particularly at the wonderful manner
of my being furnished with provisions
and ammunition; and, indeed, as my
story is a whole collection of wonders^
it affected him deeply. But when he
reflected from thence upon himself,
and how 1 seemed to have been pre-
served there on purpose to save his life,.
the tears ran down his face, and he
could not speak a word more.  After
this communication was at an end,'. I
carried him and his two men into my-
apartment,,leading them in just where
Lcame out, viz. at the top of the
house, where 1 refreshed them with
such provisions as 1 had, and showed
them all the contrivances I-had made,
during my long, long inhabiting, thai
place. . . ..=,,-.:.;
 
Ill
 
AH I showed them, all 1 said to
thorn, was perfectly amazing; but,
above ail, the captain admired my for-
ttfication, and how perfectly I had
coucenled my retreat with a grove of
treea, which, having been now planted
near twenty years, ami the trees grow-
ing much /aster than in England,* was
become a little* wood, and so thick, that
it wis impassable in any part of it, hut
at that one side where I had reserved
my little winding passage, into it, I
told him this whs my castle ami my re-
sidence, but that I had a seat in the
country, as most princes have, whither
I could retreat upon occasion, anil 1
would show him that too another time:
but at present our business was to con-
sider how to recover the ship. Me
agreed with me as to that; but told
me, lie was perfectly at a loss what
measures to take, for that there were
still six and twenty hands on board,
who having entered*into a cursed con-
ftpiracy, by which they had all forfeited
their lives to the law, would be har-
dened in it now by desperation, and
would carry it on, knowing1 that, if they
were subdued, they would be brought
to the gallows, as soon as they came to
England, or to any of the English colo-
nies; and that, therefore, there would
be no attacking them with so small
a number as we were.
I mused for some time upon what
lie had said, and found it was a very ra-
tional conclusion, and that, therefore,
something was to be resolved on spee-
dily, as well to draw the inen on board
Into some snare for their surprise, as to
f reveal their landing upon us, and des-
troying us. Upon this, it presently
occurred to me, that in a little while
the ship's crew, wondering what was
become of their comrades, 'and of the
boat, would certainly come on shore in
their other boat, to look for them j
and that then, perhaps, they might
come armed, and be too strong for us:
this lie allowed to be rational. Upon
Ais, I told him the first thing we had
to do was to stave the boat, which lay
upen the beach, so that they might
not carry her off: and taking every
thing oil. of her, leave-her so far use-
less as not to be fit to swim: accord-
ingly we went on board, took the arms
which were left on board out of her,
and whatever else we found there,
which was a bottle of brandy, and ano-
ther of rum, a few biscuit-cakes, a
horn of powder, and a great lump of
sugar in a piece of canvas (the sugar
wau five or six pounds)} all which was
very welcome to me, especially the
brandy and sugar, of which 1 had none
left for many years.
When we had carried all those
things on shore, (the oars*, mast, sail
and rudder of the boat were curried
away before, m above,) we knocked a
great hole in her bottom, that if they
had come strong enough to master us,
yet they could not carry off* the boat
Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts
that we could be able to recover the
ship; but my view was, that if they
went away without the boat, I did not
much question to make her fit again to
carry us to the Leeward Islands, ami
call upon our friends the Spaniards in
my way; for 1 had them still in my
thoughts.
While we were thus pt$pari»g our
designs, and had first, by main strength,
heaved the boat upon the beach so
high, that the tide would not float her
off at high water mark, and besides,
had broke a hole in her bottom too
big to be quickly stopped, and were'
set down musing what we should do,
we heard the ship fire a gun, and'law
her make a waft with her ensign as a
signal for the boat to come on* board:
hut no boat itlrred; and they nVed
several times, making other signals for
the boat. At last, when all their sigt
nals and iring proved fruitless', and
they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them, by the help of my glasses,
hoist another boat out, and row
towards the shore; and we found, as
they approached, that there' were no
less than ten men in her, and that they
had ire-arms with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues
from the shore, we had a full view of
them as they came, and a plain sight
e?en of their faces; because the ticl*
liaring set them a little  to the east of
the other boat, they' rowed up unite*
shore, to come to'the 'same'< pl^otf
where the other ha<11an«liNl,-'ati4^her^>
the boat lay j' by this means, "I :&%ffM4:-

had* lull view of them, and .the cap*
tarn, knew the persons and characters
of all .the men in the boat^ of whom,
he said, there where three very honest
fellows, who he'Was sure,' were led into
, this conspiracy by the rest, being over-
powered and frightened; but that as
for the boatswain, who, its seems,
was the chief officer among them, and
all the rest, they were as outrageous as
say of the ship's crew, and were no
doubt made desperate in their new en-
terprise; and terribly apprehensive he
was that they would be too powerful for
us* I smiled at him, and told him
, that men in our circumstances were
past the operation of fear j that seeing
almost every condition that could be
was better than that which we were
supposed to be in, we ought to expect
that the consequence, whether death
or life would be sure to be a deliverance.
1 asked him what he thought of the cir-
 fitimstances of my life, and whether a
.deliverance were not worth venturing
for? And where, sir, said I, is your
belief of my being *preserved here on
« purpose to save your life, which eleva-
ted'you "a little while ago; for my part,
said I there seems to me but one thing
,. amiss in all the prospect of it. What
is that?' says he. Why, said I, it is,
...that as yon say there are three or four
.honest fellows among them, which
"-should be spared,'had they been all of
„ the wicked part' of the crew 1 should
'have > thought. God's providence had
,•> singled, them out "to deliver 'them into
yoar hands j for depend upon it, every
 m&u that' comes, ashore is .our own,
 aad- shall die or live as, they behave to
 m*. As 1 spoke, this with a raised
voice and cheerful countenance, 1
found. it .greatly encouraged him \ m
>„w§.s©t vigorously to our business.
. We. had upon the first appearance of
the boat's coining from, the ship, con-
sidered of separating ;our prisoners;
and we had, indeed, secured them -eflfec-
, tually* ,"' Two  of them#,. of whom the
< captain wa* less, assured than ordinary,

.. delivered mem, to. my cave, where they
,wiro remote enough, and out of danger
* of .being heard' or discovered^ or of find-
, Ifgihek way out of the* woods if they
i'cou^ijiave delivered themsekeis-hefe
 
they left them 'bonne}, hut gave; them
provisions; and promised them, if they
continued there quietly, to five them
their liberty in a day or two \ but that
if the? attempted their escape,. they
should be put to death without mercy.
They promised faithfully to hear their
confinement with patience, and- were
very thankful that they had such ifood
usage as Co have provisions and light
left them; for Friday gave them candles
(such as we made ourselves) for their
comfort; and they did not know but
that he stood centinel over them at the
.entrance.
The other prisoners had better usage;
two of them were kept pinioned, in-
indecd, because the captain was not free
to trust them; but the other two were
taken into my service* upon the cap-
tain's recommendation, and upon their
solemnly engaging to- live and die with
us; so with them and the three honest
men we were seven men well armed; and
I made no doubt we should be able to
deal well enough with the tea. that
were coming, considering that the cap-
tain had said there were three or four
honest men among them also. As
soon as they got to the place where
their other boat lay, they ran their
boat into the beach, and came all on
shore, hauling .the boat up after them,
which I was glad to see; for 1  was
afraid they would  rather have left  the
boat at '&n anchor, some distance from
the shore, with some hands in her to
guard her, and so we should not" be
able to seize the boat. Being on shore,
the first thing they dids they-ran all to
their other boat; and it was easy to see
they were under a great surprise 'to
find her stripped as above, of all that
was in her, and a great hole in her bot-
tom, After they 'had mused-b while
upon this, the? set up two or. three
great shouts,'-holloeing with ail their
might, to try if they could make their
companions hear 5 but all  was ' to
no purpose: then they came nil clote
. in a ring, and fired <a volley of their
 small arms, which, indeed, we heard;
. trad the  echoes made the woods ring,
' but it was all one; those in 'the cave
- we were sure could not hear, and
"those in our keeping, though -they
::-lieard It well enough yet durst 'give-no
m
 
 
answer to them. They were so asto-
nished at the surprise of this, thai,
as they told us afterwards, they resolved
to go all on board agaiu» to tneir ship,
and let them know that the men were nil
murdered, and the kins? boat stayed,
accordingly, they immediately launch-
ed their"- boat a*gaiu, and got all of
them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed,
and even confounded at this, believing
they would go on board the ship
again, and set sail, giving their com-
rades over for bat, and so lie should
still lose the ship, which he was in
hopes we should have recovered; but
he was quickly as much frightened the
the other way.
T hey had not been long put off with the
boat, but we perceived them all coming
on shore again; but with this new
measure in their conduct, which it
seeing they consulted together upon,
viz. to leave three men in the boat, and
the rest go on shore, and go up into
the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to
us, for now we were at a loss what to
do; as our seizing those seven men
on shore would be no advantage to us,
if we let the boat escape; because they
would then row away to the ship, and
then the rest of them would be sure to
weigh and set sail, and so our recover-
ing the ship would be lost. However,
we had' no remedy but to wait and see
what the issue of things might present.
The seven men came on shore, and the
three who remained in the boat put her
off to a good distance from the shore,
and came to an anchor to wait for them;
so that it was impossible for m to
come at them in the boat. Those
that came on shore, kept close toge-
ther, marching towards the top of the
little hill under which my habitation
lay; and we could see them plainly,
though they could not perceive us.
We could hare been very glad they
would have come nearer to ns,< so that
we might have ireel at them, or that
they would have gone further off, that
we might lave come abroad* But
srhen they were eorae. to- the brow of
the Mil,-where they could see -a great
• way into the valleys and woods, which.
lay 'tQwandti' the 'north-east part, and
where the island lay lowest, they shout,
ed and holloed'till they were'weary;
and no* caring, it seems, to feature
far from the shore, nor far1 from one
another, they sat down together under
a tree, to consider of it. Had they
thought fit to gone to sleep there,  as
the other part of them had done, they
had done the job for us; but they
where too full of apprehensions of
danger to venture to go to sleep,
though they could imt tell what- the
danger was they had to fetir neither.
The captain made a very just propo-
sal to me upon this consultation  of
theirs, viz, that perhaps they would all
ire a volley again, to enueavour • to
make their fellows hear, and that we
should ail silly upon them, jnst at the
juncture when their pieces were all
discharged, and they would certainly
yield, and we should have them >with-
out bloodshed. 1 liked this proposal,
provided it was done while we' were
near en#ugh to conic up to them be-
fore they could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen i arid w«
lay still a long time, very iireso*
lute what course to "take. At length 1
told them there, would be nothing done,
In my opinion, till night; and then*'if
they did not return to the boat, * per-
haps we might find a way to gel be-
tween them and the shore, and'»
might use some stratagem with them
in the boat to get them on shore* We
wafted a great white, though very Im-
patient for their removiiiff, and were
very uneasy; when, after Jong coilsttl*
tations; we saw them all start up/ 'and'
march down towards the sea: it seems
they had such dreadful apprehension*
upon them of the danger of the place*
that they resolvd to go -on board' the
ship again, give their companions .over
for lost, ana so go on with their inten-
ded voyage with the ship,'
As soon as 1 perceived them go to*
wards the show, 1 imagined if to be,
as it really was, that' they;; had glfen
over their search;' and were for going
back again; and the, cantata, as ^oo«
as 1 told him my, thoughts, was' ready
to sink at the apprehensions; of it: hit
1'presently thought of a' strattreofi' to
fetch them back again, and which An-

ADVENTUlt'KS' OF
 
 
oi'de'fkl Friday and the''captain's mate
to p> 'Over the  little creek westward,
folf arils 'the place where the savages
came, on shore when Friday was res-
cied, and 'as soon as they came to a
little 'rising* ground, at about half a mile
distance, t hade them hollo out, as loud
a* -they could, and wait till they found
the'sednien heard them; that as soon
a» ever they'heard the seamen answer
them, they-should return it again;
and then keeping out of sight, tale a
round, ' always answering when the
others1 holloed, to draw them as far
into the island, and among the woods,
as possible, and then wheel about
again to me, by such ways m ! di-
rected them,
; They were just going into the boat
.when Friday and the mate' holloed:
#iid they presently heard them, and
answering, ran along the shore west-
'Ward, towards the voice they heard,
when they wrcre presently stopped by
the creek, where the water being up,
•they could not get oyer, and called for
"the boat to come up and set them
Over;' as, indeed, I expected. When
ihey had set themselves over, I co-
nserved that the boat being gone a good
;Way into the creek, and, 'tis it were, in
-a; harbour within the land, they took
'one of the three men out of her, to go
'along'with them, and left only two in
<the:Doat, having fastened her to the
-tfump of a little tree on the shore.
'This was what I wished for; and im-
mediately leaving Friday aud the cap-
tain's mate to their business, 1 took
'the'rest with me, and crossing the
creek'out of their sight, we surprised
the two men 'before they were aware;
one of them lying on the shore, and the
: other'being in the boat. The fellow on
'shore was between sleeping and waking,
and going to start up; the captain, who
•'^vas foremost, ran in upon him, and
-knocked him 'down; and then called
out to him' in the boat to yield, 'or he
-was; a, dead man. There needed very
fcw arguments to persuade a single
'ihan.'to''yield worn he saw'five men
,'tip'dh hiiii, tod'his comrade knocked
;;loWft; besides;this was, it seems, one
'''of the three who'were not'so hearty in
;;lthe"'inntiny as the" rest of the'crew, and
!'therefdr^'-was'' easily-' persuaded' :not
only to yield, but afterward* to join
very sincerely with us. In the mean
time, Friday and the'captain's mate so
well managed their business' with the
rest, that *they drew them, by hollo-
ing aiid answering,' from cine hill to
another, and from one wood to ano-
ther, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they were
Very sure they could not reach back to
the*boat before it was dark; and, in-
deed, they wefe heartily tired them-
selves also, by the time they came
back to «s»
We had nothing now to do but to
watch for them in the dark, and to fall
upon them, so as to make sure work
with them. It was several hours after
Friday came back to me before''they
came back to their boat j and we could
hear the foremost of them, long be-
fore they came quite up, calling to
those behind to come along; and
could also hear them answer, ' and
complain how lame and tired they
were, and not able to come any faster;
which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat:
but it is impossible to express their
confusion when they found the boat
fast aground in the creek, the tide
ebbed out, and their two men gone.
We could hear them call to one ano-
ther in a most lamentable- manner,
telling one another they were got' into
an enchanted island; that either there
were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered, or else there were de-
vils and spirits in it, and they should
be all carried away and devoured.
They holloed again, and called their
two comrades by their names a great
many times; but no answer. After
some time, we could see them, by the.
little light there was, run'about, wring-
ing their hands like men in despair;
and that sometimes they would go and
sit down in the boat, to rest them-
selves; then come ashore again, and
walk about again, and so the 'same
thing over again. My men would fain
have had me give them leave to fait
upon them at once in the dark; but I
was willing to take them at some ad-
vantage, so as to spare thehi,'and kill as
few of them as 1 could; and especially
1 'was unwilling to' hazard the-kilHtfg
m
 
any of our men, knowing the others
were very well armed, 1 resolved to
wait, to see if they did not separate j
and, therefore, to make sure of them,
I drew' my ambuscade nearer, and or-
dered'*' Friday and the captain to creep
upon their hands and feet, as close to
the ground m .they could* that they
might'not be discovered, and get as
near them as they could possibly, before
they offered to fire.
They had riot been long in that pos-
ture, when the boatswain, who was the
principal ringleader of the mutiny, and
kid now shown himself the most de-
jected and dispirited of all the rest,
'came walking" towards them, with two
more of the crew: the captain was so
eager at having this principal rogue so
much in his power, that he' could
hardly have patience to let him come
so near as to be sure of Mm, for they
only heard his tongue before: but
when they came nearer, the captain
and Friday, starting up on their feet,
let flv at them. The boatswain was
kiliett upon the spot; the next man
was shot in the body, and fell just by
- him, though he did not die till an hour
or two after 3 and the third run for it.
'At the noise of the fire, 1 immediately
advanced with my whole army, which
was now eight men, viz. myself, gene-
ralissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-ge-
neral; the captain and his two men,
.and the three prisoners of war, whom
•he had.trusted with arms. We came
upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that
-they, could not sec our number; and I
made the man they had left in the
boat, who was now one of us, to call •
them by name, to try if 1 could bring
them to a parley, and so might per-
haps^ reduce them to terms; which fell
out just as we desired: for, indeed it
was easy' to think, as their condition
then, was, they would be very willing
to capitulate. So he calls out, as loud
as he could, to one of them, Tom
Smith l^Tom Smith! Tom Smith an-
swered immediately, Is that Robinson?
• For It seems, he knew the voice. ' The
other answered, Aye, aye; for God*s
sake, Tom Smith, throw down your
mrms and yield, or you are all dead
men this moment.~~Who must we
.yieldto? Where are they? says Smith
 again* Here they are,, says he; here'i
our captain aid fifty men with him*
have been hunting you these two
hours: the boatswain Is killed* Will
Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner!
and if you do not yield, you are .all
lost.-—Will the? give us quarter then?
says Tom Smith, and we will yield.—*
1 will go ask, if you promise to,yield,
says Robinson: so he asked the cap-
tain; and the captain himself then
calk out, You,, Smith, you know my
voice; if you lay down your arms im-
mediately, and submit, you shall have
your lives, all but Will iitkins.
Upon this Will Atkins cried out,
For God's .sake, captain, give roe quar-
ter; what have 1 done? They have all
been as bad as 1: which, by the way,
was not true neither; for, it seems, this
Will Atkins was the first man that laid
hold of the captain, when they first mu-
tinied, and used him barbarously, in
tying his hands, and giving him injuri-
ous language. However, the captain
told him he must lay clown his arms at
discretion, and trust to the governor*!
mercy: by which he meant ine, for
they all called me governor, la a
word, they all laid down their arms,
and begged their lives j and I seat the
man that had parlied with them, and
two more, who bound them all; and
then my great army of fifty .men,
which, particularly with those three,
were in all but,eight, came up and
seized upon them, and upon their
boat;' only that I kept myself and.one
more out of sight for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the
boat, and think of seizing the ship:
and as for the captain, now he had. lei-
sure to parley with them, he expostu-
lated with them upon the villainy of
their practises with him, and at length
upon the further wickedness of their
design, and how certainly it must briag
them to misery and distress in'the ma,
and perhaps to the gallows. They-'all
appeared very penitent, and begged
hard for their lives. As for that, le
1 told them, they were none of his pri-
soners* but the commander's of tne,is-
land; that they thought they had,'set

island; but it had pleased. God so to

Though this mm all hat a fiction of
his own, yet It had its desired effect:
Atkins felt m -his- knees, to beg the
riptaln to intercede with the governor
for Ws pfe; arid til the rest begged of
Mav ^ God'a sake that they might
not be sent to England.
It noW'occurred to me, that the time
of our deliverance was come, and that
it would be a most easy thing to bring
these fellows in to be hearty in getting
pdiiesfion of the ship; so I retired in
the dark' from them, that they might
not-see'what kind- of a governor they
hid, and called 'the captain - to me:
when I called, as at a good distance*
one,of the men was ordered to speak
again, and say to the captain, Captain,
the commander calk fm von ; ana pre-
sently the captain replied. Tell his ex*
celleuey-. I am just .accosting. This
more perfectly amused them, and they
all believed that the commander was
just by with his ifty men.' Uoon the

first tiat leave them there. Upon
is 1 seemed'' a' little angry with the

1 would he as'good as mj word; and
that'if'he'did not think fit to consent
to. it 1 would set them at liberty, as I
found them j and if lie did not like it,
he might take them again if he could
catch them. Upon this they appeared
very "thankful, and t accordingly set
them at, liberty, and hack theni retire
into the woods to the place whence
they came, and 1 would , leave them
some fire-arms, some ammunition,
and* some directions how they should

Upon this 1 prepared to go on board

to cause the new captain, who was

that these men might see him*

With tuem on their circumstances. I
told; them 1 thought they had made a
'Mght choice j' that if the captain had
i^ried them, away, they would cer-
tainly, be 'hanged.. 1 showed them the
jaeV "captain hanging at. the yard~arm
of the; 'ship, and told them they had
Nothing less to expect,
':: 'When they had, alt declared their
willingness to stay, 1 then told them 1
would let them into the story of my
Jibing.there, and put them into the
wajr of m'ak|ng it easy to them: ac-
cordingly, f" gave them -the whole his-
tory m the: place, and of my coining
to;it^, showed them' my fortifications*
the way I,made my bread, planted my
*€#»,'' cured my', grapes j and, in, a
i^m»,aM that was necessary to make
ti^em'eitsy. 'I toid them the story also
,of 'the 'seventeen Spaniards thai were
,l# he. expet,ted^ %m, whom; I' left »
letter, and . made them , proraiie to
treat them in common with themselves,
fJure,it may lie noted, that the captain
had ink on board, who was greatly
surprised that 1 never hit upon1 a way
of making ink of charcoal and water,
or^ of something, else, as 1 had  done
things much more difficult,
1 left them my fire arms, vijs. five
muskets, three fowling-pieces, and
three sworcU, 1 had above a barrel
and a half of powder left; for after
the first year or two I used but little,
and wasted none. 1 gave them a de-
scription of the way I managed the
goats, and directions to milk and fatten
them, and to make both butter and
cheese: in a word, 1 ga?e them every
part of.my own story; and told-them
I should prevail with the- captain to
leave them two barrels of gunpowder
more, and some, garden-seeds, which
i, told them' I would ha?e been very
glad of: also I gave them the bag of
peas which the captain had brought
me to eat, and bade them be sure to
sow and increase them. •
, Having done all this, I. left them
the next day, and went on board the
ship, We prepared immediately to
sail, but did,not weigh that night.
!Fhe next morning.early, two of the
H\rt men came swimming to the ship's
side, and making a, most lamentable
complaint .of the other three, begged
to be taken into the ship, for jGfod's
sake, for,they- should be murdered,
and begged the captain to take them
on board, though he hanged them im*
mediately., Upon this the captain pre*
tended to have no power; without me §
but after some difficulty, and after their
solemn promises of amendment, they
were taken on board, and were sorot
time after soundly whipped and pickled?
after which they proved very honest
and quiet fellows.,
.Some time after this,;the, boat wis
ordered on shore* 4he -tide being ;upi
with the things' promised to the men;
to which the captain* at my inter-
cession^ caused their chests and clothes
to be added, which they took' and
were very thankful fpr*  I also <e»-

When! took leave of this'island, 1
carried' on 'board, for 'reliques, the
great goat-skin cap I had made, my
umbrella, ami one of my parrots;
also 1 forgot not to' take the money 1
formerly' mentioned, which had lain
by me' so long useless, that il was
grown rusty or tarnished, anil could
hardly pass'for silver, till it had been
fi little rubbed and handled; as also
the in one? I found in the wreck of the
Spanish ship. And thus I left the
island, the lfHh of December, as I
found by the ship's account, in the
year if$6,-after i had been upon it
eight and twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days; being* delivered
from this second captivity the same
iny of the month that 1 first made my
escape in the long-boat, from among
the Moors of Sauce. In this vessel,
after a long' voyage, I arrived in
England the llth of June, in the
year 1687,' having" been thirty-five
years absent
When I came to England, I was as
perfect a stranger to all the world as
if I had never been known there. My
bene factor and faithfu 1 steward, who rn
I had left my money in trust with,
was alive, but .had had great mis-
fortunes in the world; was become a
widow the second time, and very loiv
In the world. I made her very easy
as to what'she owed me, assuring her
f would give her no trouble; bat, on
the' contrary, in gratitude for 'her
former care*and faithfulness to me, i
relieved her'as my little stock would
afford; 'Which, at that time, would in-
deed allow me to do "but little for her;
but 1 assured her I would 'never forget
her former kindness to me;' nor did I
forget' her when I had sufficient to
help' her, as thai be observed in Its
-proper'-place. I went' down after-
wards into Yorkshire'; 'but my father
was dead, 'and my mother and all the
family extinct, except 'that I found
two-sisters, and two of the children of
oae of my brothers ^: and as I had been
long ago? given' over for dead, there
bad been itaprovision made' forme:
«© that,- in a word, I found nothing to re-
lieve fir assist me;' and that the little
money I "had would not do much for
me  i« to  nettling' ita • the  world;
I met'With one piece "of gratitude.
indeed, which I did not expect;, mm
this was, that the' master of the sjiip
whom ! had so happily delivered,.- andi
by the same means saved the ship and
cargo, having given a very handsome
account to the owners of the manner
how I had saved the lives of the men,
and the ship, they invited me to meet
them, and some other merchants eua-
cerncd, and all together made me H
very handsome compliment upon tljq
subject, and a present of almost .€2ftft
sterling.
But after making several, reflections
upon the circumstances of. my life,
and how little way this would go ten
wards settling me in the world, I re-
solved to go'to Lisbon, and see if '1
might not come by some information
of the state of my plantation in the
Brazils, and of what was become of
my partner, who, I had reason to sup-
pose, had some years past given me
over for dead. With this view I took
shipping for Lisbon, where f arrived
In April following; my man Friday
accompanying* me very honestly in aft
these ramblings, and proving a most
faithful servant upon all occasion^.
When I came to Lisbon, 1 found on%
by inquiry, and to tny particular'satis-
faction, my old friend i the captain of
the ship who first took me. tip at' gei
off the shore of Africa. "He was no#
grown old, and had left off, going to
sea, having put his'son, who, was fair
from a young, man, into his, ship, an$
who still iisea the Brazil trade. The
old man did' not know me; and,,in-
deed, I .hardly knew him: but I.soon
brought him to tny remembrance,
and as soon brought myself Jo .fits
remembrance, when'I told him wh©
I was. _ '"' , \.
'After some passionate expressions
of the old acquaintance lietween' us/1
inquired, yon may lie snre, after my
plantation and -my partrter." "Tlie olf
man told me lie lad riot been in ',thp

away my partner was living"; hut' tne-

ADVENTURES OF
 
tlijsiinprovcincat'of the plantation j-fer
that upon tlic general belief of my .be-
ing cast away and drowned, my trustees
had given in the account of the pro-
duce of niy part of the plantation to
the procurator-fiscal, who had appro-
priated it, in ease 1 never came to
claim It, one-third to the king, and
two-thirds to the monastry of St.
Augustine, to be expended for the be-
nefit of the poor, and for the con version
of the Indians to the Catholic faith;
hut that if I appeared, or any one for
me, to claim the inheritance, it would
be restored; only that the improve-
ment, or annual production, being
distributed to charitable uses, could
not be restored: but he assured me
that the steward of the king's revenue
from lands, and the proviedore, or
steward of the monastry, had taken
great care all along that the incum-
bent, that is to say, my partner, gave
every year a faithful account of the
produce, of which they had duly recei*
?ed my moiety, 1 asked him if he knew
to. what.height of improvement he had
brought the plantation, and whether he
thought it might be worth looking
after; or, whether on my going thither,
1 should meet with any obstruction to
my possessing my just right in the
moiety. He told roe he could not tell
exactly to what degree the plantation
was improved, but this he knew, that
my partner was grown exceeding rich
upon enjoying his part of it; ana that,
to the best of his remembrance, he
had heard that the king's third of my
part, which was, it seems, granted a-
way to some other monastry or
religious house, amounted to above
two "hundred moidores a-year: that as
to my being restored to a quiet posses-
sion of it, there was no question to be
made of that, my partner being alive
to witness my title, and my name be-
ing alio, enrolled in the register of the
country-—also he told me, that the sur-
vivors of .my two trustees were very fair
honest people, and very wealthy j and
he believed I would not only have
their .assistance for putting me in po«-
les^ion, but would find a ?ery consider-
able sum of money in their hands for
my account* .being the produce of the
&rm*, while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up, m .above;
which, as he remembered, waa for
about twelve years.
I showed myself a little concerned
and uneasy at this account, and inqui-
red of the'old captain how it came to
pass that the trustees should thus dis-
pose of my effects, vi hen he knew that
I had made my will, and had made
him, the Portuguese captain, my uni-
versal heir, &t\
, He told me that was true; but that
as there was no proof of my being
dead, he could not act as executor, un-
til some certain account should come
of my death; and, besides, he, was not
willing to intermeddle with a thing
so remote: that it was tine he had re-
gistered my will, and put in his claim;
unci could he have given any account of
my being dead or alive, he*would have
acted by procuration, and taken pos-
session of the ingeino (so they called
the sugar-house), and have given his
son, who was now at the Brazils, or-
ders to do it, But, says the old man,
I have one piece of news to tell you,
which perhaps may not be so accepta-
ble to you as the rest; and that is,
believing you were lost, and ail the
world believing so also, your partner
and trustees did offer to account with
me, in your name, for six or eight of
the first years* profits which I recei-
ved. There being at that time great
disbursements for increasing the works,
building an ingeino, and buying slaves,
it did not amount to near, so much, as
afterwards it produced: however, says
the old man, I shall give you a true
account of what 1 have received in all,
and how I have disposed of it.
After a few days farther conference
with this ancient friend, he brought
me an account of the first six years*
income of my plantation, signed by my
partner and the merchant trustees, be-
ing always delivered in goods, viz,
tobacco in roll, and sugar in .chests,'
besides rum, molasses, &c. which is
the consequence of a sugar-work; and
I found by.this account, that every
year the income considerably increa-
sed $ but, as above, the disbursements1
being large, the sum at first was small:
however the old man let tne. se6, that
he was debtor to me four hundred ,.*nd
 
141
 
seventy moidores of gold besides sixty
ctiesti of sugar, and fifteen double rolls
of tobacco, wliich were lost in his ship;
lie having been shipwrecked coining
home to^ Lisbon, about eleven years
after my leafing the place. The good
man  then began to complain of
his inisfortnnes/amlhowhe h'.id been
obliged to make use of my money to
recover his losses, and buy him a share
in a new ship. However, my old friend,
says he, yon shall not want a supply
lit your necessity; and soon m my
son returns, you shall be fully satis-
fied Upon this, lie pulls out, an old
pouch, and gives me one hundred and
sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and
giving the writings of his title to the
ship which his son was gone to the Bra-
zils in, of which lie was a quarter-part
owner, and his son another; he puts
them both into my hands, for security
of the rest.
1 was too much moved with the ho-
nesty  and kindness of the poor man
to be able to bear this; and remember-
ing what he had done for me, how he
had taken me up at sea, and how ge-
nerously he had used me on all occa-
sions, and particularly how sincere a
friend he was now to me, 1 could hardly
refrain weeping at what he had said to
me; therefore! asked him if his cir-
cumstances admitted him to spare so
much money at that time, and if it
would not straiten him? He told 'me
he could not say but it might straiten
Mm a little; but,however,it was my mo-
ney, and I might want it more than he.
Every thing the good man said was
Mi of affection, and I could hardly
refrain from tears while bespoke; in
short, I took one hundred of the inoi-
dores, and called for a pen and ink to
give him a receipt for them : then I re-
turned him  the rest, and told him if
ever 1 had possession of the plantation,
I would return the other to him also
(as, indeed, I'afterwards did); and that
a$ to the bill of sale of his part in his
son's - ship, I would not take it by any
means;. but that if I wanted the money,
1 found he was honest enough to pay
me y and if 1 did not, but came to
receive what he gave me reason to ex-
pect, 1 would never have a penny more1
worn him. •• 
When this' was past, the  old rail
asked me if he should put me into a me-
thod to make my claim to my ptanta*
tion? I told him f thought to go-over to
it myself. He said I might do so, if I
pleased; but that if 1 (lid not, there
were ways enough to secure my right
and immediately to appropriate the
profits to my own use: and as there
were ships in the river of Lisbon just
ready to go away to Brazil, he made
me enter my name, in a public register,
with his affidavit, affirming upon oath,
that 1 was alive, and that 1 was the
same person who took up the land for
the planting the said plantation at first.
This being regularly attested by a no-
tary, and a procuration affixed, he di-
rected me to send it, with a letter of
his writing, to a merchant of his ac-
quaintance at the place; and then pro-
posed my staying with him till an ac-
count came of the return.
Never was any thing more honour-
able than the proceedings upon thia
procuration; for in less than seven
months 1 received a large packet from
the survivors of my trustees; the mer-
chants, for whose account ! went to
sea, in which were the following par*
tieular letters and papers enclosed. '
First, There was the account-cur-
rent of the produce of my farm, or
plantation, from the year when their
fathers had balanced with my old For-
tugal captain, being for six years; the
balance appeared to be one thousand
one hundred and seventy-four moidored
in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of
four years more, while they kept the
effects in their hands, before the go-
vernment claimed the... administration-;
as being the effects of a person not to
be found, which they called civil
death, and the balance of this, the
value of the plantation increasing,':
amounted tp nineteen thousand four
hundred and forty-six erusadoes, being
about three thousand two hundred; Ani
forty inoidores.
Thirdly, There wm the prior of Au-
gustine's account, who had received
the profits for above fourteen yearn;;
but not being to account for what wit
disposed of by the hospital,'  very ho-
nestly declare!, he had eight hundred

ADVENTURISM OF
 
'.*hc captain's .son informed roe lie had;
*. -with" two pieces of fine English broad-
'doth, the best ! could get in Lisbon,
'five pieces of black baize, and some
'Flanders lace'of a food value* •
>' -'Having thus settled my affairs, sold
my cargo, aid turned all my effects
into good bills of exchange, my next
difficulty was, which way to go to Eng-
land: 1 had been accustomed enough
to, the'sea, and yet 1 had a strange
aversion to' go to. England by sea at
that time;  and though 1 could give no
reason for it, yet the difficulty increased
upon me so-much, that though 1 had
once shipped my baggage, in order to
go, yet 1 altered my mind, and that not
once, but two or three times,
It is true, 1 had been very unfortu-
nate by sea, and this might be some of
'the reasons; but let no man slight the
strong impulses of his own thoughts
in cases of such moment; two of the
ships which 1 had singled out to go in, I
• mean more particularly singled out than
any other, having put my things on
board one of them, and in the other to
.have agreed with the captain; I say,
two of "these ships miscarried, viz. one
was, taken by the Algerines, and the other
was east away on, the Start, near Tor-
bay, and all the people drowned, ex-
cept three; m that in either of those
vessels 1 had .been made miserable.
; • Having been thus harassed in my
thoughts,'. my old pilot, to whom I
communicated every thing, pressed
,sm' "earnestly* not to. go by sea,- but
either' to: go by land, to the Groyne,
and cross over the Bay of Biscay to
Roehetle, -from, whence it was but an
easy and safe journey by land to
Paris, and' so to-!Calais and' Dover;
or to- go 'up to Madrid, and^ so all
the way'by.' land through France.
•In-< a., .word, 1 was so prepossessed
Against'my going by. sea at all,-except
fmm' Calais to- Dover, that. 1 resolved
to. travel all the way by land: which,
*s< • t was not in haste,, and did not
value •'< the charge,, was by much  the
jpleasftn'tef.' way: and to make it more
.«Of mf> old captain •brought an Eng-
lish gentleman, the mm of a merchant
Id (Lisbon* -who was willing' to 'travel
MtU •me';: after "which -we picked up
%Wq mof&''^English merchants' -also.
and two young Portuguese gentle-
men, the last'going to Para only;
so that in all there were six of us,
and five servants j the two merchants
and the two Portuguese contenting
themselves with one servant between
two to save the charge; and as  for
 me, 1 got an English sailor to travel
with me as a servant besides my
man Friday, who was too much a
stranger to be capable of supplying
the place of a servant on the road.
In this manner 1 set out from
Lisbon; and our company being very
well mounted and armed, we made
a little troop, whereof they did me
the honor to call me captain, as' well
because I was the oldest man, as
because 1 'had two servants, and,
indeed was the original of the whole
journey.
As I have troubled you with none
of my sea journals, so 1 shall trouble
you now with none of my land jour-
nal; but some adventures that hap-
pened to us in this tedious and diffi-
cult journey 1 must not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we
being all of us strangers to Spain,
were willing to stay some time to see
the court of Spain, and to see what
was worth observing; but it being
the latter part of the summer, we
hastened away, and set out from
Madrid about the middle of October;
but when we came to the edge of
Navarre, we were alarmed,, at several
towns on the way, with an • account
that so much snow was fallen on the
French side of .the mountains, 'that
several .travellers were 'Obliged to come
back to Pampeluna, after having at*
tempted, at an extreme .hazard, to
pass on, "."
When we came to Pampeluna
itself, we found it so, indeed; and to
me, that had been always used to
a hot climate, and to countries where
1 could scarce bear any cloathes on,
the cold was insufferable: nor, indeed,
was it more painful 'than < surprising
to come but ten days before out of
Old Castile, where the weather was
not only warm, but very hot, and
.immediately to feel a wind from the
Pyrene'an mountains so very -keen;
so severely cold as to be intolerable.
 
 
147
and to endanger benumbing and
perishing of our fingers and toes. .
Poor Friday was - really frightened
when he . saw the mountains all
covered with snow, and felt cold wea-
ther* which lie hud never seen or felt
before in bis life. To mend the mat-
ter, when we came to Pmnpeluna, it
.continued snowing' with so much vio-^
lcnce,<and .so long, that the people
said' winter was come before its time;
and the roads, which were difficult
before, were now quite impassable;
for, in a word, the snow lay in some
places too thick fur us to travel, and
being not hard frozen, as is the case
in the northern countries, there was
no going without being in danger of
being buried alive every step. We
staid no lesa than twenty days at
Pain pel tin a; when seeing the winter
coining on, and no -likelihood of its
being better, for it was the severest
winter all over Europe that had been
knowtr in the memory of man, 1 pro-
posed that we should all go away to
Fontarabia, and there take shipping
for Bourdcaux, which was a very little
voyage. But while I was considering
this there came in four French gentle-
men, who having been sloped on the
French side of the passes, as we were
on the Spanish, had found out a
guide, who traversing the country
near the head of Languecloc, had
brought them over the mountains by
such ways, that they were not much
inco mm oded with the snow; for where
they met with snow in any quantity,
they said it was frozen hard enough
to bear them and their horses. We
sent for this guide* who told us he
would undertake to carry us the same
way with no hazard from the snow,
provided we were armed sufficiently
to protect ourselves from wild beasts;
for he said upon these great snows
it was frequent for some wolves to
show themselves at the foot of the
mountains, being made ravenous for
want of food, the ground being cover-
ed with snow. We told him we were
well enough- prepared for such crea-
tures as they were, if he would insure
us-from a kind of two legged wolves,
which we were told; we were in most
danger from, especially on the French
side of the mountains. He' satiifted n s
that there, mm no danger of that kind
in the  way that we were to go: so we
readily agreed, to follow him, -as did
also twelve other gentlemen, with their
servants, some French, some .Spanish,
who, as J said, had attempted to. go,
and were obliged to come back again*
Accordingly, we set out fr«tt.I%tt§-
peluna, with our guide on the 15th of
November; and, indeed, 1 was surpri-
sed, when, instead of going forward,
he came directly back with us on-  the
same road that we came from Madrid,
about twenty miles; when having
passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, we found ourselves in a
warm climate again, where the country
was pleasant, and no snow to be seen:
but on a sudden turning to his left, he
approached the mountains another way;
and though it is true the hilla and pre-
cipes looked dreadful, yet he made so
many tours, such meanders, and led us
by such winding ways, that we insen-
sibly passed the height of the moun-
tains without being much incumbered
with the snow; and, all on a sucldeu,
lie showed us the pleasant fruitful pro-
vinces of Langucuoc and Gascony,  all
green and flourishing, though, indeed,
at a.great distance, and we had some
rough way to pass still. . ,-
We were a little uneasy, however,
when we found it snowed one whole
day and a night so fast, that we could
not travel j but he bid us be. easy; we
should soon be past- it all 1. we found,
indeed, that we began to descend every
day, and to come more north than be-
fore i and so depending upon our guide,
we went on.
It was about two hours before night,
when our guide being something be-
fore us, and not just in sight, out
rushed three monstrous wolves, mi
.after them a bear, out of a hollow way
adjoining to.a thick wood; two of the
wolves made at the guide, and had
be been far before ua, he. would hare

helped him; one of them fastened

had not time, or presence of mind
enough, to draw his pistol, but holloed
and cried out -to u§ most Instil v. My

ADVENTURES OF
man Friday being next me, 1 bade
Mm ride up, and see what was the
matter. As soon as Friday came in
sight of the man, he holloed out as
loud as the other, O master! O 'mas-
ter! hut, like a bold fellow, rode di-
rectly up to the poor man, and with
his pistol shot the wolf that attacked
Mm in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that
it was my man Friday; for lie having
been used to such creatures in his
country, he had no fear upon him, but
went close up to him and shot Mm, as
above: whereas, any other of us would
have ireel at a farther distance, and
have perhaps either missed the wolf,
or endangered shooting the man.
But it was enough to have terrified a
bolder man I; and, indeed, it alarmed
all our company, when, with the noise
of Friday's pistol, we heard on both
sides the most dismal howling of
wolves; and the noise, redoubled by
the echo of the mountains, appeared
to us as If there had been a prodigious
number of them; and perhaps there
was not swell a few as that we had no
cause of apprehensions: however, as
Friday had killed this wolf, the other
that had fastened upon the horse left
him immediately, and fled, without do-
ing Mm any damage, having happily
fastened upon his" head, where the
bosses of the bridle had stuck in his
teeth* But the man was most hurt;
for the raging creature had bit him
twice, once in the arm, and the other
toe a little above his knee; and
though he had made some defence, he
wms just as it were tumbling down by
the disorder of his horse, when Friday
came up and shot the wolf.
It is easy-to suppose that at the
noise of Friday^ pistol we all mended
Our pace, and rode up as fast as the way,
which was very difficult, would give us
leave, to see what was the matter. As
soon as-'we came clear of the trees*
which, blinded' us before,' we saw
clearly what had been'the case, and
how Friday had disengaged the poor
guide, though we did not presently
'discern'what;kind of creature it was he
had killed.
"-"But ''never was a fight managed' so;
'hattiily,' and:uv8uch a surprizing man*
ner, as that which followed, between
Friday and the bear* Which gave us ail,
though at first we were surprised and
afraid for him, the greatest diversion
imaginable. - As the bear is a heavy
clumsy creature, and does not gallop
as the wolf does, who is swift and
light, so he has two particular quali-
ties, which generally are the rule of his
actions; first, as to men, who are not
his proper prey, (he does not usually at-
tempt them, except they first attack
him, unless he be excessive hungry,
which it Is probable might now be tie
case, the ground being covered with
snow,) if you do not meddle with him,
he will not meddle with you; but then
you must fake care to be very civil to
him, and give him the road, for he "is a
very nice gentleman; he will not go a
step out of his way for a prince; nay,
if you are really afraid, your best way
is to look another way, and keep going
on; for sometimes if yon stop, and
stand still, and look steadfastly at him,
he takes it for an affront; but if you
throw or toss any thing at him, and it hits
him, though it were" but a bit of stick
as big as your finger, he thinks himself
abused, and sets all other business aside
to pursue his revenge, and will have
satisfaction in point of honour;—this is
his first quality: the next is, if he be once
affronted, he will never leave you, night
nor day, till he has his revenge, but fol-
lows, at a good round rate, till he over-
takes yon.
My man Friday had delivered our
fuide, and «when we came up to him,
e was helping Mm off from Ms horse,
for the man was both hurt and fright-
ened, when, on- a sudden, we- espied
the bear come out of the'wood, aid a
vast monstrous one It was, the biggest
by far that ever I saw. We were all a
little surprised when we saw him; but
when Friday saw him, it was easy to
see joy and courage in the" fellow's
countenance: O, O, Ol says-Friday,
three times, pointing to him $ O master I
you give me te leave, me shakee te hand
with him; me tnakee you good laugh.
I was surprised to see the fellow'so
well pleased: You fool, says I, he will
eat you up.—Eatee me up I eatee me
up! says Friday, twice over again;
me eatee Mm up j me makee yon good

laugh 5 you all stay here* me show you
good laugh. So down lie sits, and get*
off Iiis boots in a moment, and puts on
a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes
they wear, and which lie had in his
pocket,) and gives my other servant Iris
horse, -with his gun away lie lew, swift
like the wind.
The hear was walking softly on, and
offered to meddle with nobody, till Fri-
day coiniug pretty near, calls to him,
as if the hear could understand him,
Hark ye, hark ye, says Friday, me
speakee with you. We followed at a
distance; for now being come down on
the Gascony side of the mountains, we
were entered a fast great forest, where
the country was plain and pretty open,
though it had many trees in it scattered
here and there. Friday, who had, as
we say, the heels of the bear, came up
with him quickly, and takes up a great
•tone and throws it at him, and hit him
just on the head, but did him no more
harm tliiin if he had thrown it against a
wall $ but it answered Friday's end, for
the rogue was so void of fear that lie
did it purely to make the bear follow
him, and show us some laugh, as he
called it. As soon as the bear felt the
blow, and saw him, he turns 9bout, and
comes after him, taking devilish long
strides, and shuffling on at a strange
rate, so as would have put a horse to a
middling gallop: away runs Friday,
and takes his course as if he run towards
~m for help; so we all resolved to fire
at once upon the bear, and delifer my
man; though I was angry at him hear-
tily for bringing the bear back upon
11s, when he was going about his own
business another way: and especially I
was angry that he turned the bear
upon us,, and then run away; and 1
called out, You dog, is this your ma-
king us laugh: Come away, and take
your horse, that we may shoot the
creature. He heard me, and cried out,
-Mo shoot, no shoot; stand still, and
. Ton get much laugh: and as the nim-
ble creature ran, two feet for the bear's
one, he turned on a sudden, on one side
of us, and seeing a great oak tree it
for his purpose, he beckoned to us to
follow; and doubling his pace, he gets
 nimbly up the tree, laying his gun
down upon the grouad, at about §m or
sLi yards from the bottom of < the tree.
The bear soon came to the tree, and
we followed at a distance: the first
thing lie did, he stopped at the gun,
smelt to it, but let it lie, and up lie
scrambles into the tree, climbing like
a cat, though so monstrous heavy* 1
was amazed at the folly, as I thought
it, of my man, and could not for my
life see any thing to laugh at yet, till
seeing the bear get up the tree, we. all
rode near to him.
When we came to the tree, there
was Friday got out to the small end of
a large branch, and the bear got about
half-way to him. As soon as the bear
got out to that part where the limb of
the tree was weaker,—Hal says he to
us, now you see me teachee the bear
dance: so he falls a jumping and sha-
king the bough, at which the bear be-
gan to totter, but stood still, and be-
gan to look behind him, to see how he
should get back; then, indeed, we did
laugh heartily. But Friday had not
done with him by a great deal;.when
seeing him stand still, he calls out to him
again, as if he had supposed the bear
could speak English, What, you come
no farther? pray you come farther:, s#
he left jumping and shaking the treej
and the bear, just m if he understood
what he said, did come a little farther 1
then he fell a-jumping again, and the
bear stopped again. We thought now
was a good time to knock Mm on the
head, and called to Friday to, stand
still, and we would shoot the bear:
but he cried out earnestly, O pray 1 O
pray! no shoot, 111 e shoot by and then 5
lie would have said by and by. How-
ever, to shorten the story, Friday danced
so much, and the bear stood so tick-
lish, that we had laughing enough, but
still could not imagine what the fellow
would do: for first we thought he de»
pended upon shaking the bear off; and
'we found the bear was too cunning for
.that too j for he would not go out far
enough to be thrown down, but'clings
fast with his great broad daws' and feet',
so that we could not imagine,,what
would be the end of it, and what-ihe
jest would be at last. But .Friday: put
us put. of .doubt quickly;, for ' peeing
the bear cling fast to the bough, and
that he would not bt persuaded id

day, you no come farther, me go; you
no coirie to me, me come to you; and
upon' this, lie goes Out to the smaller
ctitl of the bough, where it would bend
with his weight, and gently lets him-
self clown he it, sliding down the
bough,, till he canie near enough to
jump down on his feet, and away lie
runs to his gun, takes it up, and stands
still Well, said 1 to him, Friday what
will you do now? Why don't you shoot
Mroi—No shoot, says Friday, no yet;
me shoot now, me no kill; me stay,
give you one more laugh: and, indeed,
so he'did, as you will see presently;
for when the hear saw his enemy gone,
he comes' back from the bough where
he stood, but did it mighty cautiously,
looking behind him every step, and
coming backward till he got into the
bod? of the tree; then with' the same
hinder-end foremost, he came down
the tree, grasping it with his daws, and
moving one toot at a time, very lei-
surely. At this juncture, and just before
lie could set his hind-foot on the ground,
Friday stepped up close to him, clap-
ped 'the muzzle of his piece into his
ear,' and shot him dead. Then the
rogue turned mbout, to see Jf we did
not laugh j and when' he saw we were
pleased,by our looks, he falls a laughing
himself very loud. So we kill bear in
my'country, says Friday. So you kill
thiin? says 1 r why, you have no guns,
—No, says he, no 'gun, but shoot great
much,long arrow. This was a good
diversion to us; but we were still" in a
wild place, and our guide very much
hurt, i and what to do we hardly knew:
the howling of wol?es run much in my
heal';* tad, indeed, except the noise I
once heard on the shore of Afriea, of
which 1 have'said something already, 1
«e#r'' heard" any thing that filled me
with sd touch1 horror.
These things and the "approach of
night,;.called,us' off, or else, ms Friday
would'nava had us,1 we should certain-
ly ''nave'taken the skin of this tnon-
atrttu* "creature off, which was worth
saVing; 'but we- had near three leagues
to'goi/'attd' our 'guide hastened us; -so
'weiefthlto,'"'arid'Went forward on our
journey. '' ' 
The' 'ground wa§ still covered with
snow, though not so deep and danger*
ons as 'on the mountains; and 'the
ravenous creatures as we heard after-
wards, were come down into" the
forest and plain country, pressed by
hunger, to seek for food, and had clone
a great deal of mischief in the villages,
where they surprised the country peo-
ple, killed a great many of their
sheep and horses, and sonic people too;
We had one dangerous place to pass,
which our guide told us,' if there were*
more wolves in the country we should
find them there; and this was' a small"
plain, surrounded with woods on every
side, and a long narrow defile, or lane,
whieh we were "to pass to get through
the wood, and then we should coate ta
the village where we were to lodge. It
was within half an hour of sunset when
we entered the first wood, and a litfte
after sunset when we "came into the
plain; we met with nothing in the first
wood, except that, in a little pM»
within the wood, which was net above
two furlongs over, we saw five great
wolves cross the road, full speed, one
after another, as if they had been in
chase of some prey, and had it in viewr;*
they took no notice of Us, and were
gone out of sight in a few moments.
Upon this our guide, who, by the way,
was 'but a faint-hearted fellow, 'bid us
keep in a ready posture, for he belie-
ved there were more wolves a-coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes
about us; but we saw no more wolves
till we came through that wood which was
near half a league, andentei'cd the plain.
As soon as we came into the plain,
we had occasion enough to look about
us: the first object we met with waa
a dead horse, that is to say, a poor
horse which the wolves had' killed, and
at least a dozen of them at work, we-
could not say eating of him, but pick-
ing of his bones'rather | for • they had
eaten up all the flesh before. 'We did
not think fit to distutb them' at their
feast; neither'did'they take much no-
tice of up. Friday would have let fly
at them, but I'would not suffer -him by
any means; for I found we 'were like-
to have more business upon our hands
than we were; aware of.' We were not'_
gone half over the plain, when -We"
began'to hear the wolves-"' howl in'' the
151-;,
 
wood pa our left in a frightful manner,
and presently after we saw about a
hundred coming'On directly towards us,
all in a body and most of thein in line
as regularly as an army drawn up by
experienced officers, 1 scarce knew in
what manner to receive them, but found
to draw ourselves in a close line was
the only way; so we formed in a mo-
ment: but that we might not have too
much interval, I ordered that only every
other man should fire, and that the
others who had not fired should stand
ready to give them a second volley im-
mediately, if they continued to advance
upon us; and then that those who had
fired at first should not pretend to load
their fusees again, but stand ready
every one with a pistol, for we were all
armed with a fusee and a pair of pis-
tols each man: so we were, by this
method, .able to fire six volleys,, .half
of us. at a time,: however, f at present
we had no necessity; for upon firing
the first volley, the enemy made a fill
stop, being terrified as well with the
noise as with the fire j four, of them be-
ing shot in the head, dropped; several.
others were wounded, and went bleed-
ing off, as we could see by the snow. I
found they stopped, but did not imme-
diately retreat; whereupon, remem-
bering that Lbad been told that the
fiercest creatures were terriled at the
voice of a man, f caused all the com-
pany to hollo as loud as we could; and
I found the notion not altogether mis-
taken; for upon our shout, they began
to retire, and turn about, 1 then or-
dered a second volley to be tired in
their rear which put them to the gal-
lop, , and away they went to the
. woods. This gave us leisure to charge
our pieces again; anct that we might
lose no time, .we .kept going; but we
had but little more than loaded, our
fusees,'aod put'ourselves in readiness,
when we heard a terrible noise in the
same wood, .on our left, only that it
was farther, onward, the same way we
were to go. . 
^ The night, was coming, on, and the
light began to be dusky, which, made
it worse on our side; but the noise in-
creasing, we could easily, perceive that
it was thf howling and yelling of, those
hellish creatures yand. -on a sudden,
we perceved .two or three .troops of.
wolves, one on our left, one behind us,
and one in our front, m that we, seem-
ed to be surrounded with them: how-
ever, as they did not:fall upon ns, we-
kept our way forward, as fast as. ,xyC'
could make our horses goy which, the
way being very rough, was only a good
hard trot. In this manner we mmt
in view of the entrance of the wood,
through which we were to pass, at the 
farther side of the plain -f but we were
greatly surprised, when coming nearer .
the lane or pass, we saw a confused
number of wolves standing just at the
entrance. On a sudden* at another
opening of the wood, we heard the
noise of a gun, and looking that way,
out rushed a horse with a saddle and.
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and
sixteen or seventeen wolves after him,
full speed; indeed the horse had' the
heels' of them, but as^ we supposed, that'
he could not'hold it at that rate, iwe,
doubted not but that they'would get up'
with him at last j no question i but they
did. -
But here we had a most horribly
sight § for riding up to the entrance
where the horse came out, we found
the carcasses of another horse and two
men, devoured by the ravenous crea-
tures ; and one of the men was no .doubt:
the same whom we-heard fire the gun,
for, there lay a gun just by him, fired
•off j but as to the man, his head and
the upper part of his body were, eaten'
up. This filled us with,horror, andwe
knew noj what course to take;; but the
creatures resolved us soon, for'they ga-
thered about us presently, in hopes of ,
prey; and I, venly believe there were,;
'; three hundred of them,. - It happened
very much to 'our advantage,; that' at.
the entrance into' the wood,-but a ,
little way'' from it, there lay soine
large timber-trees, which had lieen, cut ,
"down .the summer before,.and I 'sup-'
pose i lay {there ^ for carriage,, - •, J drew;
'my little troop in among .those .trfces*,
and placing ourselves in,-a lin«j behlM';'

ABVBNTURE& Of
 
?-ptt§ $La|'ge than the- creatures made
upfprusi p this place* They came on
with a growling' kind, of noise, and
mounted the p mm of timber, which
as-.? $aidr was. our breast-work, as If
they were only rushing upon their
prey; and this fury of theirs, it seems,
was* principally occasioned by their
seeing our torses behind us. I order-
ed our mm- to Ire as before, every
other man; and they took their aim so
sure, that they killed several of the
wolves at the first volley; but there
was a necessity to keep a continual
tiring, for they came on like devils,
those behind pushing on those be-
fore,
When, we had fired a second ¥o!ley
of our fusees, we thought they stopped
a little, and 1 hoped they would nave
gone off; but it was but. a moment,
for cithers came forward again;, so we
Ired two volleys of our pistols; and I
believe-  in these four firings we had
hilled seventeen or eighteen of them,
$nd-- bwed twice, as many, yet they
came on again. 1 was loath to spend
j)ur shot too hastily; so I called my
g*jwant» not my man Friday, for he
was better employed, for, with the
.greatest dexterity imaginable, he had

called my other,man, and giving him
a<. horn of powder,. 1 bade "him' lay a

which answered our expectation §; for
the crying" and howling they made- wait
better understood by their fellows;,.so
that they all fled and left us.
We had, irst and last, killed about
threescore of them; and had it been
day light, we had killed many more.
The held of battle being thus cleared,
we made forward again, for we had
still near a league to go. We heard
the ravenous creatures howl and yell, in
the woods as we went, several times,
and sometimes we fancied we saw
some of them, but the snow dazzling
our eyes, wc were not certain: in
about an hour more we come to the
town where we were to lodge, which
we found in a terrible fright, and all
in arms; for, it seems, the night before,
the.wolves and some bears had broke
into the village, and put them in such
terror, that they were obliged to keep
guard, night and day, but especially in
the night, to preserve their cattle, and,'
indeed, their people.
The next morning our guide was so
ill, and his limbs swelled so much with
with the rankling of his two wounds,
that he could go no farther;, so we
were obliged to take a,new guide here,
and go to Thoulouse, where we found
a warm climate, a fruitful pleasant
.country! and no snow, no wolves,
nor any thing like them: but when we
we told our story at Thoulouse, they
told us it was nothing but what was
ordinary in the great forest at the foot
of the mountains, especially when the
snow lay on the ground 5 hut they in-
quired much what kind of a guide we
.had. got, who would venture to bring us
that way in such a severe season; and
told us" it was surprising we were not
^all devoured. When we told them how
we placed ourselves, and the • horses in
. the middle, they blamed us exceed-
ingly, and told us it was fifty to,, one
but we had, been all destroyed.; for it
was; the sight. 06 the horses which made
. the wolves so*" furious,, seeing their
prey; and that, at other times, they
. are .really afraid of a., gun;, but: being

stratagem of the train of powder
mastered them, it had been great odds
but that we had been torn to pieces:
whereas, had we been content to have
nat still on horseback, arid fired as
horsemen, they would not have taken
the hordes so much for their own,
when men were on their backs, as
otherwise; and with all they told its,
that at last, if we had stood altogether,
and left our horses, they would liuve
been so eager to have devoured them,
that we might have come olF safe,
especially having our fire-arms in our
bauds, and being' so many in number.
For my pari; 1 was never "so sensible of
danger in my life; for seeing above
three hundred devils come roaring and
_ open-mouthed to devour us, and having
nothing to shelter us, or retreat to,
1 gave myself over for lost; and, as it
was, I believe 1 shall never eare to
cross those mountains again; I think 1
would much rather go a thousand
leagues by sea, though 1 was sure to
meet with a storm once a week.
I'have nothing uncommon to take
notice of in m? passage through
France, nothing out what other tra-
vellers have given an account of, with
much more advantage than 1 can. I
travelled from Thoulouse to Paris,
and without any considerable stay came
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover,
the 14th of January, after having a
severe cold season to travel in.
I was now come to the centre of mj
travels, and had in a little time all my
new discovered estate safe about me;
the bijls of exchange which 1 brought
with me having been very currently
paid.
My principal guide and privy coun-
sellor ' was tny good ancient widow;
who, in gratitude for the money 1 had
sent her, thought no pains' too* much,
nor care too great, to employ for me;
and 1 trusted her so entirely with every
thing, that I was perfectly easy as to
the .security of my effects: and, indeed,
1 ,was very happy from the beginning*
and -now to the end, in the unspotted
integrity of this good gentlewoman,
1 -now "resolved to dispose of my
plantation m the Brazils* If r could
find mmmn. 'For this purpose; 1 wrote
to »y.oid Qfcnd nt Lisbon j who faring
offered it to the two merchant!?, the
survivors of my trustees, who lived in
the Brazils, they accepted the offer,
and remitted thirty-three thousand
pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisbon, to pay for it, Hav-
ing signed the instrument of sale,
and sent, it. to my old friend, lie re-
mitted me bills of exchange (or thirty-
two thousand eight hundred pieces of
eitfht for the estate, reserving the pay-
ment of a hundred moidorea a-year to
himself during his life, and fifty moi-
dorca afterwards to his s*on for life,
which 1 had promised them.
Though 1 had sold my estate in the
Brazils, yet I could not keep the
country out of my head; nor could I
resist the strong inclination 1 had to
see iny island. My true friend, the
widow, earnestly dissuaded me from
it, and so far prevailed with me, that
for almost seven years, she prevented
my running abroad; during which tibc
1 took my two nephews, the children
of one of my brothers, into my care:
the eldest having something of As' own,
I bred tip as it gentleman, and gave
him a settlement of some addition to
his estate, after my decease. The
other I put out to a captain of a ship;
and after five years, finding Mm a-sen-
sible, bold, enterprising young fellow,
1 put Mm into a good snip, arid sent
Mm ' to sea: and this young fellow
afterwards drew me in, as old as 1 was,
to farther adventures myself.
'In the mean time, I  in part settled
myself here; for, first of all, I mar-
ried, and' that not'either to my disad-
vantage or dissatisfaction, and had
three children, two sons  and  one
daughter; but my wife dying* "and
my nephew coming home with good
success' from a'voyage-to Spain; my
inclination to go abroad, and lis'im-
portunity prevailed, and crigaged me
to go in his ship as a private' trader to

ADVENTURES OF
 
THAT homely proverb used on so
many-occasions iii England, viz. "That
what is bred in the bone, will not go
out of'(he flesh," was never more veri-
fied than in the story of my life. Any
one would think, that after thirty-five
years affliction, and a variety of unhap-
py circumstances, which few men, if
any, ever went through before, and
after near seven years of peace^and
enjoyment in the' "fulness of all things,
grown oM, and when, ife^er, it might
be allowed m'e to , have had experience
of every state of middle life, and to
know which was inost adapted to make
a man completely happy; 1 say, after
nil this, ,.ahy one would have thought
that,the native propensity to rambling,
which F gave an account ( of in my
first-setting out in the world to have
been so predominant in my thoughts,
should be worn out, the volatile part
be fully evacuated, or at least conden-
sed, and 1 might, at sixty-one years of
ager l»ve been a little inclined to stay
at home, and have done venturing life
and fortune any more.
Nay, farther, the .common motive
of foreign adventures' was "taken away
in me'; fori had no fortune to#make;
I haf toothing to seek: if I had gained ten
thousand"' pounds, 1 had been no richer;
for Iliad already sufficient for me, and
for tnose f nad to leave it toj and that-
1 had''Was visibly fncrmMiig'y for hav-
ing no great family, 1 could' not ..'spend
the Ittcotoe M"vmM I had, unless-'T
would set up for an expensive way of
living, such fts a great family, servants,
equipage, gaiety, and the like, which
were things I had no notion of, or in-
clination to; so that 1 had nothing
Indeed to do but to sit still, and fully
enjoy what! had got, and see it increase
daily upon my hands. Yet all these
things had no effect upon me, or at
least not enough to resist the strong
inclination I had to go abroad again,
which hung about me like a chronical
distemper. In particular, the ^desire
of seeing my'new plantation in the
island, and the colony ! left there, ran
in my head continually. I dreamed of
it all night, and my imagination ran
upon it ail day; it was uppermost in,all
my thoughts j and my fancy worked so
steadily and strongly upon it that I talked
of it in my sleep; in short, nothing could
remove it out of my mind: it even broke
so violently into all my discourses, that
It made my conversation tiresome, :for-
! could talk of nothing else ^ all my -
discourse ran into it, even to, imperti-
nence j and I saw it in myself. -" - -.
1 have often heard persons-,:of good
judgment say, that all the stir people'
make lit the "world • abomt^ ghosts ' and
apparitions, is owing to 'the strength:
of imagination, and the powerful ope*
ration of fancy in their minds $ teat
'there1 is- no such' thing as' a spirit ap-
pearing, 'or'a ghost walking, and. the-
like j that pate's poring, affectionate*.  •
ly uptfn the f a&t conversion  of/their -
155'
deceased friends,-sorealises it to them,
that they are capable of fancying, upon
some extraordinary circumstances,
that they see them, talk to them, and
are answered by them, when, in
truth, there is nothing* but shadow and
vapour in the thing, and they really
know nothing; of the mutter.
For my part, 1 know nothing to this
hour whether there are aoy such things
as real apparitions, spectres, or walk-
ing of people after they are deadj or
whether there u any thing in the sto-
ries they tell ns of that kind, more
than the product of vapours, siek
minds, and wandering fancies: but
this f know, that my imagination work-
ed up to such a height, and brought
me into such excess of vapours, or
what eke I may call it, that I actually
supposed myself often upon the spot at
my old castle behind the trees; saw my
old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the
reprobate sailors I left upon the island;
nay, I fancied 1 talked with them, and
looked at them steadily* though 1 was
broad awake, as at persons just before
me; and this 1 did till 1 often frighten-
ed myself with the images my fancy
represented to me. One time, in my
sleep, I had the villainy of the three
pirate sailors so lively related to me
by the first Spaniard and Friday's
father, that it was surprising; they
told me how they barbarously attempt-
ed to murder all the Spaniards and that
they set ire to the provisions they . had
laid up, on purpose to distress and
starve them; things that 1 had never
heard of, and that • indeed were never
all of'them true in fact; but it was so
warm in ray imagination, and so re-
alized to .me, that, to-the hour I saw
thcnvl could not be persuaded tail
that' it was, or would be* tree; also how
I resented' it, when the Spaniard com-
plained to in-©! *ad  how 1' brought
them to justice* tried them before me,
and ordered them all three to be han-
ged'.  What there was really in this,
shall-;be seen in its place: for however
1 came to form such things in my
dream, awl what, secret converse of
spirits, injected it, yet there was, I say,
much of' it true. , I. own, that this
dream/* bad - nothing in it literally and
specifically true; but the goneral • part
was so true, the base villainous beha-
viour of these three hardened rogues
was such, and had been so much worse
than all 1 can describe, that the dream
had too much similitude of the fact;
and as 1 would afterwards have punish-
ed them severely, so, if 1 had hanged
them all 1 had been much in the right,
and even should have been justified
both by the laws of God and man. But
to return to my story; In this kind of
temper 1 lived some years; Iliad no
enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours,
no agreeable diversion, but what had
something or other of this in it; so
that my wife, who saw my mind wholly
bent upon it, told mc very seriously
one night, that she believed there was
some secret powerful impulse of Pro-
vidence upon me, which had deter-
mined me to go thither again; and that
she found nothing hindered my going,
but my being engaged to a wife and
children. She told me, that it .waj
true she could not think of parting
with me | but as she was assured, 'that
if she was dead it would be the first
thing 1 would do; so, as it seemed to
her 'that the thing was determined
above, she would not be the only ob-
struction; for,. if I - thought fit, and
resolved to go—Here she found me,
very intent upon her words, and that
I looted very earnestly at her, so that
it a little disordered her, and she stop-
ped. I asked her, why she did not go
on, and say out what ,slie was going to.
say? But I perceived, that her heart
'was too full, and some tears stood In
her eyes. Speak out, ray dear, said Ij_
are you willing I should,go? No,
says she, very affectionately, I am
 far from willing; but if you are re-
solved to go, "says she, and, rather
than I. would be the only hinderance,

• think it a most preposterous thing for

tion, yet, if it must be, said she, again,

ADVENTURES OF
 
wife*s brought me a little 'out of the
vapours, and 1 began to consider what
I wm doing; I corrected my wander-
ing fancy,' and began to argue with
myself sedately, what business 1 had,
after threescore years, aad after such
a life of tedious sufferings and disasters,
and closed in so happy and easy a
re an tier; 1 say, what business had I
to rusk into new hazards, and pet my-
self upon adventures fit only for youth
and poverty to run into.
With those, thoughts 1 considered
my new engagement; that I had a
wife, one child born, and my wife then
great with child of another; that I had
all the world could give me, and had
no need to seek hazard for gain; that
I was declining in years, and ought to
think rather of leaving what 1 had
gained, than of seeking to increase it;
that as to what my wife had said of its
being an impulse from Heaven, aad
that "it should be my duty lo go, I had
no notion of that: so, after many of
these cogitations, 1 struggled with the
power of my imagination, reasoned
myself out of it, as 1 believe people
may always do in like eases if they
will; and, in a. word, I conquered it;
composed myself with such arguments
as occurred to my thoughts, and which
my present condition furnished me
plentifully with; and particularly, as
the most effectual method, 1 resolved
to divert myself with other things, and
to engage in some business that might
effectually tie me up from any more
excursions of this kind; for 1 found
i that thing return upon me chiefly when
J was idle, and had nothing to do, nor
any thing of moment immediately be-
fore me. To this,purpose 1 bought a
little farm in the county of Bedford,
and resolved to remove myself thither.
'.I 'had a little convenient house upon it $
and the land about it, I found, was ca-
pable of great improvement ;md it
. was .many ways suited to my inclina-
tion, , which delighted in cultivating,
managing, < planting, and improving of
,land j aad particularly*, being an inland
, coptitry, I was removed from convers-
ing among sailors, and things- relating
Mo tke remote *part of the world. ,  .
In a word, J waiji ^ow» to my farm,
'settled my family, bought me ploughs,
harrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows,
and sheep, and, setting, seriously to
work, became, in one half-year, a mere
country gentleman: my thoughts were
entirely taken up in managing my ser-
vants, cultivating the ground, enclos-
ing, planting, &e.; and J lived, as I
thought, the moat agreeable life that
nature was capable of directing, or
that a man always bred to misfortunes
was capable of retreating to.
1 formed upon my own land; 1 had
no rent to pay, was limited by no ar-
ticles; i could pull up or cut clown as 1
pleased: what I planted was for my-
self, and what I improved was for my
family; and having thus left oft* the
thoughts of wandering, I had not the
least discomfort in any part of life as
to this world. Now 1 thought indeed
that 1 enjoyed the middle state of life
which my father so earnestly recom-
mended to me, and lived a kind of hea-
venly life, something like what is des-
cribed by the poet, upon the subject of
a country life—
** —Free from vices, free from care,
41 Age has no pain, and youth no snare."
But, in the middle of all this felicity,
one Mow from.unseen Providence un-
hinged me at once; and not only<made
a breach upon me inevitable and incu-
rable, but drove me, by its conse-
quences, into a deep relapse of the wan-
dering disposition, which, m I may
say, being born in my very, blood,
soon recovered its hold of me, and,
like the returns of a violent distemper,
came on with an irresistible force
upon me, so that nothing could make
any more impression upon me. This
blow was the loss of niy wife. It, is
not my business here to write an elegy
upon my wife, give a character of her
particular virtues, and make my court
to the sex by the lattery of a funeral
.sermon,, She was, in a few words, the
stay of all my affairs^ the centre of all
my enterprises, the engine that, by her
prudence, reduced me to that -happy
compass I was in, from the most extra-
vagant and ruinous project thatJut-
.tared in my head* as above,, and' did
more t® guide my rambling genius
titan a mother's tern,, a fatfcarV in-
structions, a Mead's counsel, or all my
157
 
own reasoning powers, could do. I
was happy in • listening1 to her tears,
find ifi being moved by her entrea-
ties; and to tlic last degree desolate
and dislocated in the world by the
loss of her.
When she was gone, the world
looked awkwardly round me. J was as
much a stranger in it, in my thoughts,
as I was in the Brazils, when ! first
went on shore there; and as much
alone, except as to the assistance of
servants, m 1 was in my island. 1
knew neither what to think nor what to
do, I saw the world busy around me;
one part labouring1 for bread, another
part squandering in vile excesses or
empty pleasures, equally miserable,
because the end they proposed still lied
from them; for the men of pleasure
every day surfeited of their vice, and
heaped up work for sorrow and repen-
tance; and the men of labour spent
their strength in daily struggling- for
bread to maintain the vital strength
they laboured with: so living in a
daily circulation of Borrow, living hut
to work, and working but to live, as if
daily bread were the only end of weari-
some life, and a wearisome life the
only occasion 'of daily bread.
This put me in mind of the life I
lived in my kingdom, the island;
where 1 suffered no more corn to grow,
because 1 did not want it: and bred no
more goats, because 1 had no more
use for them; where the money lay in
the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had
scarce the favour to be looked upoii in
twenty years.
Ail' these things, had 1 improved
them as 1 ought to have done, and as
reason and religion had dictated to me,
would have taught me to search farther
than human enjoyments for a full feli-
city; and that there was something
which certainly was the reason and entl
of life, superior to all these things, and
which was either to be possessed, or at
least hoped for, on this side of the
grave.
' But my sage counsellor was gone;
I wag Mice a ship without a pilot, that
<OuW only run afore the wind; tny
thoughts ran all away into the' old
affair; my head was quite turned with
the whimsies of  foreign' adventures;
and all the pleasant, Innocent amuse-
ments of my farm, My |ardeo» Mj
cattle, and my family, which before-
entire ly possessed me, were nothing to
me, had no relish, mi were like intuit*
to one that lias no ear, or food to one
that has no taste: in a word, f resolved
to leave off housekeeping, Jet my farm,
and return to London; and in a few
months after, 1 did so.
When 1 came to London, f was still
as uneasy as 1 was before;' I had no
relish for the place, no employment in
it, nothing to do but to saunter about
like an idle person, of whom it may be
said he is perfectly useless in God's
creation, and it is not one farthing'*
matter to the rest of his kind whether
he be dead or alive. This also was the
thing which, of all circumstances of
life, was the most my aversion, who
had been all my days used to an active
life; and I would often say to myself,
A state of idleness is the very dregs of
life: and indeed 1 thought f was much
more suitably employed when 1 was
twenty-six days making me a deal
board.
It was now the beginning of the
year 1693, when my nephew, whom,
as I have observed before, I had brought
tip to the sea, and had made him
commander of a ship, was come home
from a short voyage to Bilboa, being
the" first he had made. He came to
me, and told me that some merchants
of his acquaintance had been proposing
to him to go a voyage for them to the
East Indies and to "China, as private
traders.—And now, uncle, says he, if
you will go to sea with me, 'I wilt
engage to land yoti upon your old ha-
bitation in the island; for we are to
touch at the Brazils.
Nothing can be a greater demon-
stration of a future state, mud of the
existence of an invisible world, than
the concurrence of second eatises with
the Ideas of things which' we form in
our minds, perfectly 'reserved, and not
communicated to any in the  world;
My nephew knew nothing1 how "far
my distemper of wandering' was • re-
turned upon me, aad! knewadthitigoC
what he had in his thought to-'Say,
when" that very morning, before he
came to'tae, 1 had/'in a gteat deal of
 
ADVENTURES OF
 
confusion of thought, unci revolving
.every part of my circumstances in my
mma»'come to this resolution,. viz.
that I would go to Lisbon, and consult
with my old sea-captain; and so, if it
was rational and practicable, 1 would
go and see the island again, and see
what was become of my people there,
i had pleased myself with the thoughts
of peopling the place, .and carrying
i&habitants from hence, getting a
.patent for,the possession, and I knew
not what; when,in the middle of all
this, in comes my nephew, as  1 have
said, with his project of carrying me
thither in his way to the East Indies.
I paused awhile at his words, and
looking steadily at him, What devil,
said 1, sent yon on this unlucky errand?
My nephew stared, as if he had been
frightened, at first; but perceiving
that I was not much displeased with
the proposal, he recovered himself. I
hope it may not be an unlucky proposal,
sir, says he; I dare say yon would be
pleased to see your new colony there,
where yon once reigned with more
felicity than most of your brother-
monarchs in the world.
:, In a word, the scheme hit so exactly
with my temper, that is to say, the
prepossession I was under, and of
which I have said so much, that 1 told
him, in a few words, if he agreed with
 the merchants I would go with him;
hut 1 told him I would not promise to
f> any farther -than my own island.
rhy, sir,-says lie, vou don't want to
'be left there again, f hope?. Why, said
J, can yon not take me up again on
your return? He told me it would
not be .possible to do so; that the
merchants would never allow him to
come that way with, a laden ship of
such falue, it being a month's sail out
of Ins way. and might be three or
four. Besides, sir, if I should miscarry,
said he, and not return at all, then
yon would be jmt reduced to the con-
dition yon were in before,. . ,
This was very rational; but we'both
found put a remedy for it; which was,
to carry a framed sloop on board the
^ship, which being .ta)cen in pieces, .and
shipped on .board the; ship,- might, by
'the help  of some carpenters, whom
we agreed to earry with-,, its,,- -he se.t; &f>
again in the island, and finished,,fit to
go to sea, in a few days. ,, , „
1 was not long resolving; for indeed
the importunities.of my nephew joined
so effectually with my inclination,
that nothing could oppose me j on the
other hand, my wife being dead, I
had, nobody concerned themselves* so
much for me as to persuade me to
one. way or the other, except my an-
cient good friend the widow, who
earnestly struggled with me to con-
sider mj years, my easy circumstances,
and the needless hazards of a long
voyage; and, above ail, my, young
children. But it was all to no pur-
pose ;—I had an irresistible desire to
the voyage; and 1 told her I thought
there was something so uncommon in
the impressions I had upon my mind
 for the voyage, that it would be a kind
of resisting Providence if 1 should
attempt to stay at home: after which
she ceased her expostulations, and
joined with me, not only in. making
provision for my voyage, hut also in
settling my family-affairs for my ab-
sence, and providing for the education
of my children.
In order to this, 1 made my will, aid
settled the estate I had in such a
manner for my children, and placed in
such hands, that I was perfectly easy
and satisfied they would have justice
done them, whatever might befall me:
and for their education, I left it wholly
to the * widow, with- a sufficient .main-
tenance to herself for her carer all
which she richly deserved ..for no
mother could have taken more care
in their education, or .understood it
better: and. as' she lived,till 1 came
home, I also lived to thank her for it.
My nephew was ready to sail about
the beginning of January ,1694-5; and
I, with my man Friday, went on board
in the Downs the 8th: 'having, be-
sides that sloop which 1, mentioned
above, a very considerable cargo of. all
kinds , of necessary things* for my
colony; which, if I did not. find, in
good condition, I resolved toieaqe so.
First, I carried with me some sei>
vants whom..! .purposed to place there
as inhabitants, or at, least to set on
work there, upon mj account, while 1
staid,-and either-to leave., -them there*
m
 
or etrry them forward, as they would
appear willing: particularly, 1 carried
two carpenters, a smith, awl a very
handy ingenious fellow, who was n
cooper by trade, and was also a general
mechanic; for lie was dexterous at
'making wheels, and hand-mills' to
grind corn, was a good turner, and a
good pot maker; lie also made any
thing that was proper to make of
earth, or of wood; in a word, we
called him our Jack of all trades,
With these I carried a tailor, who had
offered hi in self to go a passenger to
the East Indies with my nephew, hut
afterwards consented to stay on our
new plantation; and proved a most
necessary, 'handy fellow, as could be
"desired, in many other businesses he-
sides that of his trade; for, as 1 ob-
served formerly, Necessity arms us
for all employments.
•My cargo, as near as ! can recollect,
for 1 have not kept account of the par-
ticulars consisted of a sufficient quan-
tity of linen, and some English thiu
stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards that
I expected to find there; and enough
of them, as, by my calculation, might
comfortably supply them for seven
years: if 1 remember right, the ma-
terials 1 carried for clothing them,
with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and
all such things as they could %vant for
wearing, amounted to above two hun-
dred' pounds, including some beds,
bedding, 'and household stuff,' particu-
larly kitchen-utensils, with pots, ket-
tles, 'pewter, brass, &c. and near a
hundred pounds more in iron*work,
Hails, 'tools -of'every' kind, staples,
hooks,' hinges, and- every necessary
thing 1 could think of.
 •• I carried also a hundred spare arms,
muskets, and fusees; besides some pis-
tols, a considerable quantity of shot of
all sizes, three or four tons of lead,
and two pieces-of brass cannon; and
bcr;mse. 1 knew not what time and
"li--o extremities 1 was providing for,
1 •:«/• ried a hundred barrels of powder,
'•Mdes swords, cutlasses, and the iron
p.n-f of some pikes and halberds: so
.'lr-it:> in shorty we'had a large magazine
<»f;dl .-sorts of stores: and 1 made my
n-phweartytwo small quarter-deck
-"^ 'more tlnm-he wanted for his ship
to leave behind if there was occasion;
that, when we came there, we might
build a fort, and man it against all
sorts of enemies: and, indeed 1 at'first
thought there would be i need enough
for all, and much more, if we hoped to
maintain our possession of the island;
as shall .be seen in the course of that
story,
I had not such bad luck in this
voyage as I had been used to meet
with; and therefore skill have the less
occasion to interrupt the reader, who
perhaps may be imputient to hear how
matters went with my colony: yet
some odd accidents, cross winds, atid
bad weather happened on this first set-
ting out, which made the voyage longer
than I expected at first: and I, who
had never made but one yoyage, viz.
my first voyage to Guinea, in which f
might be said to come hack again as
the voyage was first designed, began
to think the same ill fate attended me;
and that I was born to lie never con-
tented with being on shore, and yet to
be always unfortunate at sea.
Contrary winds first put us to north-
ward, and we were obliged to put in at
Gal way in Ireland, where we lay wind-
bound two*and'twenty days; hut we
had this satisfaction with the disaster,
that provisions were here exceeding
cheap, and in,the utmost plentyj so
that while we lay here, we 'never
touched the ship's stores, but rather
added to them. Here, also, I  took
in several live hogs, and two cows,-with
their calves; which 1 resolved,' if'I
had a good passage, to put on  shore
in my island; but we found occasitn
to dispose otherwise of them.'
We' set out on the 5th of February
from Ireland, aid had a very fair gale
,: of wind for some days. ' As 1 remem-
ber, it might be about the 20th of Fe-
bruary, in the evening- late, when the
mate, having the watch, came into the
round-house, and told m he saw a lash
of Ire, and heard % gun-fired;'atid
while he was telling us  of it, 'a: boy
come in, and <told'us the boatswain

hearing of the^e ijuns that they tu-»k
down their mast- and sails; the sound
cominir from the windward, they re-
solved" to lie-by til! morning. Some
time after this, hearing no more, fcun*,

It is impossible for me to express*

s.ies tin.', variety of postures, which
ihes,; poor delivered people ran into,
to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and
M \ I
ADVENTURES OF
 
fear are,easily described; sighs, tears,
froans,<and a very few motions of the
Bad' and 'hands, make up the sum of
Its variety; but an excess of joy, a
jturprfse of joy, lias a thousand extra-
vagances in it: there were some in
tears; some raging and tearing them-
selves, as if they had been in the great-
est agonies of sorrow; some t stark
ravimr,' and downright lunatic*; '-some
fan about 'the ship stamping with their
feet, others wringing their hands;
some ware dancing, some singing,
some laughing, more crying; many
quite dumb not able to speak a word-,
others sick and vomiting; several swoon-
ing, and ready to faint; and a few-
Were crossing themselves, and giving
God thanks.
. 1 would not wrong them neither;
there might be many that were thank-
ful afterwards, hut the passion was
too strong for them at first, and they
were not able to master it: they were
thrown into ecstacies, and a kind of
'phrensy; and it1 was' but a very few
that were composed and serious in
their joy.
 Perhaps, also, the case may^ have
lOtne addition to it from the particular
circumstance of that nation they be-
longed to; 1 mean the French, whose
'temper is allowed to be more volatile,
more passionate, and more sprightly,
'%nd' their spirits more fluid, than in
:' .-other 'nations, '1 am not philosopher
'enough to determine the cause; but
'nothing 1 had ever 'seen before 'cainc
xtp to it. The ecstasies poor Friday,
my trusty savage, was in, when he
; 'found his father in the boat, came the
„ * nearest to it j and the surprise of the
: master and his two-' companions, whom
I delivered' from the villains that set
": "them on the -shore in the island, came
'"ft -little way' towards it; but nothing
; -was 'to compare to-this, either that I
: * jsafa in Friday, or any where else in
toy life.
It m further observable, thai these
extravagances did not show themselves,
; fit' that' different manner 1 have men-
•tioned,.'in different persons'only; hut
1 hall'''the'-";farie|y would:-appear, in a
• thort; mcceisfon of "moments, in one
;",;'%i the,; same person,"' -A-man'that we
''• tiaW'this InktteMtfmb, -and W it were
stupid and confounded, would the
next minute be dancing and holloing
like an antic; and the next moment be
tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes
to pieces, and. stamping them under
his feet, like a madman; in a' few mo-
ments after that we would have him all
in tears, then sick, swooning, and,'had
not immediate help been had, lie would
in a few moments have been dead;
and thus it was, not with one or two,
or ten, or twenty, but with the great-
est part • of them j and, if 1 remember
right, our surgeon was obliged to let
blood "of about thirty of them.
There were two priests among them*
one an old man, and the other a young
man; and that which was strangest
was, the oldest man was the worst
As soon as he set his foot on board
our ship, and saw himself safe, he
dropt down stone-dead, to ail appear-
ance; not the least sign of life could
be perceived in him: our surgeon im-
mediately applied proper remedies to
recover him, and was the only man in
the ship that believed he was not
dead. At length he opened a vein in
his arm, having first chafed and rubbed
the part, so as to warm it as much as
possible: upon this the blood, which
only dropped at first, flowing freely,
•in three minutes after the man open-
ed Ms eyes j and a quarter of an hour
after that he spoke, grew better, and
in a little time quite well After the
Mood was stopped, he walked' about;
told us he was perfectly well; took a
dram of cordial which the surgeon
gave him, and whs what we called come
to himself About a "quarter of an
hour after this, ihey came running
• into the cabin to the surgeon, .who
was bleeding a French woman .• that
had feinted, and told him the priest
:was gone stark mad. It seems he had
begum to revolve the change of Ms
'circumstances in his mind, and again
this put him into an'.ecstasy of'joy;
his spirits whirled about faster than
the vessels could' convey . them, "the
blood grew hot and fevetfshj'.gnd' the
.man-was as fit for Bedlam" as atty crea-
ture that ever was in it: the', surgeon
would not bleed Mm, again' in that
condition, but gave him something to
doze'and put 'htm to "sleep, which,
im
 
after some time, operated upon }um,
and lie awoke next morning perfectly
composed and well.
The younger priest behaved with
great command of his passions, and
was .really ait example of a serious
well-governed mind; at .his Urst com-
ing oil board the ship, lie threw him-
self flat on his face, prostrating himself
in thankfulness for his deliverance, in
which 1 unhappily and unseasonably
disturbed him, really thinking he had
been in a swoon; lint he spoke calmly,
thanked me, told me lie was- giving
God thanks for Ms deliverance 5 beg-
ged me to leave him a few moments,
and that, next to his Maker, he would
give me thanks also.
I was heartily sorry that I disturbed
him, and not only left him, but kept
others from interrupting him also, lie
continued in that posture about three
Minutes, or little more, after 1 left him,
then came to me, as lie had said he
would, and, with a great deal of seri-
ousness and affection, but with tears
in his eyes, thanked me, that had
under' God given him, and so many
miserable creatures, their livea. I
'told him 1 had 110 room -to move him
to thank God for it, rather than me,
for 1 had seen that he had done that
already; but 1 added, that it was no-
thing but what reason and humanity
dictated to all men, and that we had
m much reason as he to give thanks to
God, who had blessed us so far, .as to
make us the instruments of his mercy
to so many of his creatures.
After this, the young priest applied
himself to his country-folks; laboured
to compose them; persuaded, entreat-
ed, argued, reasoned .with them, and
did his utmost to keep them within
the exercise of their reason; and with
«ome he had success, though others
were for a time out of all government
of themselves.
1 cannot 'help committing this to
wrilliig, as perhaps it may be useful
to those into whose hands it may fall,
for llie guiding  themselves * in all the
extravagances of their .passions; for
If an excess of joy can carry men .out
•to such a length .beyond -the reach of
•their reason, what will not' tjic extra-
.-vagaoces of anger, rage, and a provo-
ked mwd ..carry .us to! And* indeed,
here 1 aaw .reason for .keeping all
exceeding watch over .our passions of
every 'kind, as well .those of joy ami
satisfaction, as those of sorrow and
antfer.
We were something disordered,,by
these extravagances among our new
guests, for the first day; but when they
had been retired, lodgings pro?ided for
them as .well as our ship would .allow,
and they had slept heartily—as most
of them did, being fatigued and fright -
ened—they were quite another sort
of people the next day.
Nothing of good manners, or civil
acknowledgements for the kindness
shown thcrn, was wanting; the French,
it is known, are naturally apt enough
to exceed that way. The captain and
one of the priests came to me the next
day, and desired to speak with me and
my nephew: the commander began to
consult with us what should be done
with them; aid, first, they told us that
we had saved their lives, so all they
had was little enough for a return to
to us, for that kindness received. The
captain said they had saved some mo-
ney, and some things of value, in their
boats, catched hastily out of the Barnes,
and if we would accept it, they were
ordered to make an offer of it all to
us .j they only desired to be set on
share-somewhere in our if ay, where, if
fossible, they might get a passage to
ranee. My nephew was lor accept-
ing their money at. 'first word, and. to
consider what to do with them after*
wards; but 1 overruled Mm in that
part, for 1 knew what It was to be set
on .ahore in a itrange country: and if
the f ortuipese captain that took me
up at sea had served me so, and took
all 1 had for my deliverance, I must
have starved, or have been as much a
slave at the Brazils as,, I had been at
Barbary, the mere being .sold to a Ma-
hometan excepted-: and periiaps a

deiiye*€»d, if we were la the like, or any
other extremity; that we had done
nothing- for them but what we believed
they would ha?e done for us, if we had
been in their case, and they in 'dura;
hut that we took them up to save them,
not to plunder them; and it would be.
a most barbarous thing to take that
little from them which they had saved
out of, the fire, and then set them on
shore and leave them; that this* would
be irst to save them from death, and
then kill them ourselves $ save them
from drowning, and abandon them to
starving; and therefore 1 would not let
the least thing be taken from them.
As to setting them on shore, 1 told
them, indeed, that was an exceeding
difficulty to us, for that the ship was
bound to the East Indies; and though
we were driven out of our course to
the' westward a very greai way, and
perhaps were directed by Heaven on
purpose for their deliverance, vet it
was impossible for us wilfully to
change our voyage on their particular
account; nor could my nephew, the
captain, answer it to the freighters,
•with' whom he was under charter-party
to pursue his voyage by the way of
Brazil; and all 1 knew we could do for
them, was to put ourselves in the way
of meeting with other ships homeward-
bound from'the West Indies, and get
them a passage, if possible, to England
or France. ,
'Hie irst part" of the proposal was so
generous and kiod^ the? could' not but
be Very thankful for it 5 but they were in
ft,-.very' great .consternation, especially
tite passengers, at'the notion of being
.carried iiway to the last Indies: they
then entreated -me, that seeing I was
driven so far to the westward before I
i^et..with, them, I would at,least keep
on,the .same, course to the Banks of
Newfoundland, where it was probable
1 might meet with some ship or sloop
..that "they, might :hire to carry them
Jack Jo Canada^ from whence they
1*'thought, this was but -a reasonable
,'', revest on .their part, and therefore I
«^ined;to,agree to it; for, indeed, 1
^'c^AlereC'^that to carry this, whole
,' company to tile East ladies?, would n#t
'i»ty be an intetembte severity 'upon the
poor people, but would he ruining cut?
whole* voyage, ""by devouring all otitf
provisions; so 1 thought it no breach of
charter-party, but what an unforeseen
accident made absolutely necessary' to
us, and in which no one could say we
were.to blame; for the laws of (Jod
and' nature Would' have forbid that' we
should refuse to take up two'boats full
of people in such a distressed condi*
tionj and.the nature of the thing,'as
well respecting ourselves as the poor
people, * obliged us to set them on
shore somewhere or other for their de-
liverance: so 1 consented thai we would
carry them to Newfoundland, if wind
and weather would permit; and if not,
that 1 would carry them to Martinico,
in the West Indies.
The wind continued fresh easterly,
but the weather pretty good; md m
the winds had continued in the points
between N. E. and S. E. a long time,
we missed several opportunities of
sending them to France; for we met
several ships bound to Europe, where-
of two were French, from St. Christo-
pher's; but they had been so long
beating up against the wind, that they
durst take in no passengers, for fear of
wanting provisions for'the voyage, as'
well for themselves as for those they
should take in; so we were obliged--to
go on. It was about a week after this
that we made the Banks of Newfound-
land 5 where, to shorten my story, we
put all our French people on board-a
bark, which they hired at sea there, to
put them on shore, and afterwards to
carry theni to France, if they could
get' provisions to victual themselves
 with. When 1 say, all the French
went on shore, I should remember,
that the young priest I spoke of, hear-
ing we were bound to the East Indies,
desired to go the voyage with us, 'and
to be set on shore on the coast of .Co-
romandei; which 'I readily agreed-'to,
for Twonderfully liked the man, and
: hid-very good reason, as will appear
afterwards; also four of the-seamen
entered themselves on our ship, and
- proved very usefttl'fellows.
From hence we directed our course
lor the West Indies, steering away.S.
and S. by E. for about twenty days to-
gether, sdmet»es little #r no -wind at
165
 
nil $ when we. met with another subject
for our humanity to work upon, almost
«s deplorable as that before.
It %vas in the latitude of 27 degrees
5 minutes north, on the 19th day of
March 1694-5, when we spied a sail,
our courses. E. and by S.: we soon
perceived it was a large vessel, and that
she bore up to us, but could not at first
know what to make of her, till, after
coming a little nearer, we found she
had lost her main top-mast, fore-mast,
and bowsprit; awl presently she ired
a< gun, as a signal of distress: the wea-
ther was pretty good, wind at N. N. W.
a fresh gale, and we soon came to
speak with her.
We found her a ship of Bristol,
hound home from Barbadoes, but had
been blown out of the road at Barba-
does a few days before she was ready
to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the
captain and chief mate were both gone
on shore; so that, besides the terror of
the storm, they were in an indifferent
ease for good artists to bring the ship
home. They had been already nine
weeks at sea, and had met with an-
other terrible storm, after the hurri-
.cane was over, which had blown them
quite out of their knowledge to the
westward, and in which the? lost their
masts, as above. They told us they
expected to hare seen the Bahama is-
lands* but were then driven away again
to the south-east, by a strong gale of
wind at N. N. W. the same that blew
now: and having no sails to work the
ship'With but a main-course,, and a
kind of square sail upon a jury fore-
mast, which they had bet up, they could
not lie near the wind, but were endea-
touring to stand away for the Canaries.
But that which was worst of ail was,
that they were almost starved for want
of provisions, besides the fatigues the?
had undergone: their bread and flesh
were quite gone; they had not one
ounce left in the ship, and had none for
• eleven days.. The only relief they had
.was, their water was not all spent, and
they had about half a barrel of, flour
left; they had sugar enough \. some
•succades, or sweet meats,. they kod at
twit,: hut they were devoured $,• and they
i', /X^er6'Wejre\^^0Htih.,jRiid|hk in^tacr.
and a maid servant, on board, who
were going passengers, and'thinking
the ship was ready to sail, unhappily
came on board the evening before the
hurricane began; and having no provi-
sions of their own left, they were in a
more deplorable condition than the rest:
for the seamen, being reduced to such
an extreme necessity themselves, had no
compassion, we may be sure, for the
poor passengers; and they were, in-
deed, In a condition, that their misery
is very hard to describe,
1 had perhaps not known tills part,
if my curiosity had not led me (the
weather being* fair, and the wind aba-
ted) to go on board the ship. The
second mate, who, upon this occasion,
commanded the ship, had been on board
our ship, and he told me, indeed, they
had three passengers in the great ca-
bin, that were hi a deplorable condi-
tion: Nay, says lie, I believe they are
dead, for 1 have heard nothing of them
for above two days $ and I was afraid
to inquire after them, said lie, for 1 had
nothing to relieve them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to
give them what relief we could spare j
and, indeed, I had so far overruled
things with my nephew, that 1 would
have victualled them^ though we had
gone away to Virginia* or any other
part of the coast of America, to have
supplied ourselves | but there was no
necessity for that.
But now they were in a new danger;
for'they were.afraid of eating'too
much, even of that little we * ga're
them. The mate or commander
brought six men with Mm In his boat;
but these poor wretches looked'lie
skeletons, and were so weak, that they
could hardly sit to their'oars. The
mate himself was very ill, and half-
starved \ for, he declared he had re-
ferred nothing from the men, and went
share and share alike with them in every
bit they ate, ',
/I captioned him to eat sparingly,, but

lie la.fi taken it, be .grew better. In
the "iMfiii, 'time I forgot not the
na£n; I ordered victuals to- be given
tfiep j and the' poor' creatures rather
devoured than ate it: they were so
exceeding* hungry* that they were In a
kind ravenous, find had no,command
of .themselves; and two of them ate
with $o much greediness, that they
were in danger of their lives the next
miming.
 The sight of these people's distress
was very moving to me, and brought
|o minfl what I had a terrible prospect
of .at ray first coming on shore in my
island, where ! had never the least
mouthful of food, or any prospect of
•procuring any; besides the hourly ap-
prehensions t had of being made the
food of. other creatures. But all the
While the mate was thus relating to
me. the miserable condition of the
ship's company, I could not put out
of my thought the story he had told
me, of the three poor creatures in the
great eibin, viz. the mother, her son,
and the maid-servant, whom he had
heard nothing of for two or three
cjayg, and whom, he seemed to confess,
they had wholly neglected, their own
extremities being £e great: by which
I,.Understood, that, they had really
given them, no food at all, and that
therefore they must be perished* and
,b.O., all lying dead, perhaps, on the
floor or deck of the cabin.
As, I therefore kept the mate,'whom
\ye then called captain, on board with
lis, men, to refresh them* so 1 also
forgot not {he starving crew that were
left on board; but ordered my own
boat to go on board the ship, and, with
in? mate and twelve men, ,to carry
tteih a sack of bread* and four or
five'pieces of beef to boil. Our
surgeon charged, the men to cause the
,mea t to be boiled while they staid, and
to' Ireep guard in the cook-room, to
prevent the men taking it to eat raw,
or faking it out of the" pot before it
, vfna, well -boiled, aid,then to give every
'roan, .hut a vrery little at a time; and
. t»|, this' caution , he preserved the men,
Who vfouid dtherwtae have killed theip-
-^Ues , with«.that very food that wis
£ " en thfcui ..op purpose to mm taeir
At the same time, „1, ordered the
mate to go into the g'reat cabin, and'
see what condition the poor passengers
were in$ and if they were alive, „ to
comfort them, and give them what
refreshment was proper: and the
surgeon gave him a large pitcher,
with some of the prepared broth which
he had given the mate that was! on
board, and which he did not question
would restore them gradually.
1 was not satisfied with this; but,
is 1 said above, having a great mind to
«ee the" scene of misery which 1 knew
the slip itself would present me with,
in a more lively manner than I cotdd
have it by report, I took the captain of
the ship, as we now called him, with
me, and went myself, a little after. Id
their boat.
I found the poor men on board
almost in a tumult, to get the victuals
out of the boiler before it Was ready *f
but my mate observed his orders, and
kept a good guard at the cook-room?
door; and the man he placed there^
after using all possible persuasion to
hate patience, kept them off by force:
however, he caused some biscuit-cakes
to be dipped in the pot, and softened
with the liquor of the meat, which
they called brewis^ and gave them
every one some, to stay their stomachs*
and told, them it was for their own
safety that he was obliged to, give
them but little at a time. But it was
all in vain: and had 1 not com6 on-
board* and their own commander and
officers with me, and with good words;
and some threats also of giving1 themf
60 more,! believe they would have
broken into the cook-room by force,
and torn the meat out of the iurriacc i
for words are indeed of very small
force to a hungry belly y horn-ever, we
pacified then), and fed them, gradually
and ctetlously for the first, and the
next time gave them more, and at last
iillted their bellies, find the men did
well enough.
But the milery of the poor pas-"
sengers in the cabin wag of another
nature, and far beyond the rest 5 for
as, first, the ship's company had so
little for themselves,' it was but too
true that they had at Irst kept them
%aj. low, and' at tot totally negleiftyd
m
 
 
them"; 'Ho 'that for six or serai clays It
might be said they had really no food
at all, and for several clays before very
little. The poor mother, who, as the
men reported, 'was a woman of sense
and good-breeding, had ' spared all she
could so affectionately for her son,
that at last she entirely sunk udder it;
find when the mate of our ship went
in, she sat upon the floor or deck,
with her back up against the sides,
between two chairs, which were
lashed fast, and her head sunk between
her shoulders, like a corpse, though
not quite dead. My mate said all he
could to revive and encourage her, and
with a spoon put some broth into her
mouth. She opened her lips, and
lifted up one hand, but could not
speak; yet she understood i what he
said, and made signs to him, intimating
that it was too late for her, but pointed
to her child, as if she would have
said they should take' care of him.
However, the mate, who was exceed-
ingly moved with the sight, endea-
voured to get some of the broth into
her mouth, and, as he said, got two or
three spoonsful down; though I
question whether he could be sure of
U or not; but it was too late, and she
died the same night.
The youth, who was preserved at
the price of his most affectionate
mother's life, was mrt so far gone;
yet he' lay in a cabin-bed, as one
"stretched out, with hardly any life left
In him. He had a piece of an old
glove in his mouth, having' eaten up
the rest of it; however, being young,
'and having more strength than his
mother, the mate got somethiri| down
Ms throat, and, he began sensibly to
revive; though by giving him, some
time after, but two or three spoonsful
extraordinary, he was very sick, and
brought it up again.
But' the next care was the poor
maid: she lay all along upon the
deck, hard by her mistress, and Just
like one that had fallen down with an
apoplexy, and struggled for life. Her
limbs were distorted;' one of her
hands was clasped round the frame of
, a chair# and she , griped it so hard,
. that we could not easily make her let
it go: her other arm lay ©?er her
head, and her feet lay  both together*'
set fust against the1 frtf me of the eabhV
table: in short, she lay just'like bn#
in the agonies of death, and f^sbe
was al'lve too. ,
The poor creature was not, only
starved with hunger, and terrtfle'd with
the thoughts of death, but, lis' the
men told us afterwards, was broken-
hearted for her mistress, whom she-
saw dying for two or three days before,
and whom she loved most tenderly."
We knew not what to do* with thw
poof girl; for when our surgeon, who
was a man of very great knowledge
and experience, had," with great, ap-
plication, recovered her as to life, he
lad her upon his hands as to her
senses; for she was little less than
distracted for a considerable time after,
as shall appear presently.
Whoever shall read these memo-
randums must be desired to consider,
that visits at sea are not like a jotiriiejr
into the country, where sometimes
people stay & week or a fortnight at a
place: our business was,' to relievte
this distressed ship's crew, but riot
lie by for them; and though they were
willing to steer the same course with
tis for some days, yet we could cany
no sail, to keep pace with a ship thit
had no masts: however, as i their
captain begged of us to help 'him to
set up a main-topmast, arid-a^fndof
a topmast to his Jury-foremast,, we
did, as it were, lie % him for three or
four days; and then having given him
ive barrels of beef, a barrel of port,
two hogsheads of biscuit, and a pro-
portion of peas, lour, and what other
things we could spare; and 'taking
three casks of sugar, some runi, 'tihl
some pieces of eight from therii fo>
satisfaction, we left them j taking ©to
board with lis, at their own'earnest
request, the youth and the maid," atfd
all their goods.  ._"'./

And: the 'island, and hating no chart
for the coast, nor any land-mark, I did
not know it when *I saw it, or know
whether I saw it or not. - ' ^ 
We beat about a great while, and
went on shore on several islands in the.
mouth of the great river Oronooque,
but none for my purpose: only this I
learned by my coasting the shore, that
1 was under one great mistake before,
viz. that the cnutihent which 1 thought
I saw from the island I. lived in, was
really no continent, but a long island,
or rather a riclge of islands, reaching
from one to the other side of the ex-
tended mouth of that great river; and
that the savages who came to my
island were not properly those which
we call Caribbees, but islanders, and
other barbarians of the same kind, who
inhabited something nearer to our side
than the rest.
In short, 1 visited several of these
islands to no purpose j some I found
were inhabiteu, • and some were' not:'
on one of them 1 found some Spaniards^
and thought they had Kved there j
but speaking with them, found they,
had a sloop lay in a small creek hard
by, and came thither to make salt and
to catch some pearl muscles, if they
could; but that'they belonged to the
Isle de Trinidad,.'which-'lay farther
north, in the latitude of 10' And'1 II-.'
degrees. . - ,':
Thus coasting* from one1 island tcr
another, sometimes, with the ship,
sometimes . with the Frenchmen's.
shallop^ which we had found a con-'
venient 'boat, aud therefore' kept her-
with their very .good .will,' at length'1
came fair on the south side of my"
island, and presently .knew the very*'
countenance of the place; so I brought 
the ship safe to an anchor, broadside
with the little creek, where my old
habitation was, , -.  :. ..

As--soon as l/«aw tbe^piace, I called .
for ;Friday»< and asked hi to if lie knew
where he was; lie looked -about a'
little, and presently clapping his  hands,
cried, O yes, O there, O yes, O there,
pointing to our old habitation, and
feji dancing and capering like a mad
fellow-) and I had much ado to keep
liiin from jumping into the sea, to
swim .ashore to the place.
Well, Friday, says I» do you think'
we shall .find any body here or no?
and do you think we shall see your
father? "The fellow stood mule m
a stock a good while, but when 1
named his father, the poor affectionate
creature looked dejected, and I could
see the tears run down his face very
plentifully. What k the matter, Friday r
gays I; are you troubled because you
may see your father? 'No, no, says he,
shaking his head, no aee him more:
no, never more see him again. Why
so, said 1, Friday? how do you know
that! 0 no, O no, says Friday: he
long ago (lie, long ago; he much old
man. "Well, well, says I, Friday, you
don't know; but shall we see any one
else then r The fellow, it seems, had
better eyes than I, and he . points  to
the .hill just above my old house j and
though we lay half a league off, he cries-'
out,. We see, we see, yes, yes, we  see
much man there,-and there, aad there,
1 looked, .but I saw' nobody, no, not
with a perspective-glass, which .was,-1
suppose, because 1 could not hit the
place; for the fellow was right, as I
found upon inquiry the next day; and
there .wera five or six men all to-
gether,.. who stood, to look at the ship,
not knowing what to think of us.
.As aooa'as Friday told me he saw
people, 1 caused the English ancient
to be spread, and fired three guns, to
giver them notice we were friends j and
itv about half a quarter of an hour
after, we .perceived a smoke arise from
the side of the creek ; so 1 immediately
ordered the boat 'out, taking Friday
with me; and hanging out a white
flag* or a .lag of truce, I went directly

whom 1 knew, by his face perfeetlf
well; as to his habit, I shall describe*-
it afterwards. 1 ordered nobody to g&?
on shore at first but myself j but there;
was no keeping Friday in the boat,:
for the affectionate creature had spied
his father at a distance, a good way
off the Spaniards, where indeed 1 saw
nothing of him; and if they had not
let him go ashore, he would  have
jumped into tlte ?ea. He mm no
sooner oil shore, but'he Hew away to-
his father, like an arrow out of a eow.j
It would hate made any man' shed

of what happened to him abroad, tov

affection was to' be found in Christians
I© -their parents in our part of the
world, one would be tempted to say,
there would li&rdly have been any need
of the fifth commandment.
• But tills is a digression: 1 return
to my landing. It would be needless
to take notice of all the ceremonies
tfnd 'civilities that the Spaniards recei-
ved" me with. The Irst Spaniard,'
who, as I said, I knew ?ery well, was
lie whose life 1 had saved; lie came
towards the boat, attended by one
ihore,'carrying a flag1 of trace also;
and he not only did • not know me at
first, but he bad no thoughts, no notion
of its being me that was come, till 1
spoke to him. Seignior, said I, in
Portuguese, do you not know me r
At which b© spoke not a word, but
giving his musket to the man that was
with Mm, threw Ms arms abroad, say-
in.af something in Spanish that 1 did
nut perfectly fear, came forward and
embraced me; telling me he was in**
excisable riot to know that face again,
that he- had once seen as if an angel
from heaven sent to sate his life; "he
said abundance of  very handsome
things, m a Well-bred Spaniard always
knows-how-; and then beckoning to
the'person that attended Mm, bade
h'ui go and call out his Comrades*
Ibr'then asked me if I would walk
t<» toy old habitation, where he would
v;\v& >me possession of my own house
iigaih, and where I should see they
had made but mean improvements t
sir"'I walked along with him $ but,
alas! I- could no more find the place
again than if ••! had never been there;
for they "hid planted so many trees,
ttftd. placed them in such a posture, so
thick ;aitd close to one another, and in
ten'^fears' time they were grown so
big, that, in' 'short, the place 'Was in-
accessible, except by such windings
and • blind Ways as  they themselves
Wily,: Who' made them, could find.

toould'say there was need enough of' it,
When iteyiiad given1 me- an ^avcoutit

after they had the misfortune to find
that 1 was gone- He told me he could
not but have some satisfaction in mt
good fortune, when he heard that 1!
was gone in a good ship, and to my
satisfaction j that he'had oftentimes a
strong persuasion that, one time or
other, he should see me again; but
nothing that ever befclMiim in his life,'
he said, was so surprising and afflict-,
ing to him at first, as the disappoint-
ment he was under when he came
back to the island and found 1 was'
not there.
As to the three barbarians (so h^
called them) that were left behind,
and of whom, he said, he had a long
story to tell me} the Spaniard's all
thought themselves much better among
the savages, only that their number
was so small: and, says he, had they
been strong enough, we had been All
long ago in purgatory $ and with thai
he crossed himself on 'the breast.
But, sir, says he, I hope you will not
be displeased when 1 shall tell you,
how, forced by necessity, we Wert obi
liged for our own preservation, tb dis-
arm them, and make them oUf/'sub-
{ects, Who would not "be 'content with
eing moderately our masters, but
Would be our murderers, I answered
I was heartily afraid of it When I left
them there, and nothing troubled imfe
it ray parting from the' island,- but
that they were not come back, that 1
might have put them in possession of
every thing first, and left the' others
in a state of subjection, as they iinei-
ved j but if they had reduced them to
it, 1 was very glad; and should be very
far from finding any fault with it s for
1 knew they were a parcel' of refracto-
ry, ungovernable villains, and were fit
for any manner of mischief.;
While I was rthus' saying this, the
man 'came whom he had sent Back,
and with Mm eleven men more. In
the dress they were in, "it was impos-
sible to guess what nation they were
of; but he made all  clear, both to
them and to me. First he turned td me,

know who 1 was-, upon which they all
came up, one by one, not" as if they
had becu sailors and ordinary fellows,
and the like, but really as if they had
been ambassadors of noblemen, and I
a monarch or great conqueror: their
behaviour was to the tmt degree obli-
ging and courteous, and yet mixed
with a manly, majestic gravity, which
very well became them; and in short,
they had so much more manners than
I, that 1 scarce knew how to receive
their civilities, much less how to re-
turn them in kind.
The history of their coming to, and
conduct in, the island, after my going
away, is so rery remarkable, and has so
many incidents which, the former part
of my relation will help to understand,
and which will, in most of the .parti-
culars, refer to the account 1 have al-
ready given, that 1 cannot but commit
them, with great delight, to the read-
ing of those that come after me.
I shall no longer trouble the story
with i a relation in the first person,
which will put me to the expense of
ten thousand said 1% and said htfs%
and he told me9* and / told him'*, and
the like j hut' I shall collect the facte
historically, as near as 1 can gather
them out of my memory, from what
they related to roe, and from what 1
met with in my conversing with then!
and with the place.
. In order to do this succinctly, and
as intelligibly as I can, 1 must go back
to the circumstances ill which I left
the Island, and in which the person!
were of whom I am to speak. And
first, it is necessary to repeat, that 1
sent away Friday's • father and the
Spaniard (the two whose Ikes 1 had
rescued from- the savages) in a large
canoe, to the mahi, as 1 then thought
it, to fetah over the Spaniard's com-
panions that he left behind Mm, lit
order to safe, them froha the like cala*
inity that he had been in, and In order
to succour them for the present $ mi
that, If possible! #e might together
find some, way for our deliverance
afterwards.'
^ When 1 sent them away, 1 had-no
visible appearance( of, or the- least
poom to hrtpefor#i my olvn deliverance,
an jr. .more ttiah t lad twenty -jeait
before, much less hat! i arty foreknow^
ledge of what afterwards happened;
1 menu of tin English ship coining mi
shore there to fetch me off; and it
could not hut be a very great "sw.
prise to them, when they came t»ek|
not only to find that I was gone, litit
to find three strangers left on the spot,
posseted of all that 1 had left behind
me, which would otherwise 'have 'been-
their own.
The first thing, however, which I
inquired into that 1 might begin where
1 left off, was of their own part i and
I desired he would give me a particular
account of his voyage hack to his
countrymen with the bout, when 1
sent him to fetch them over. He told
me there was little variety in that part,
for nothing remarkable happened to
them on the' way, having had very
calm weather, and a smooth sea. As
for his countrymen, it could not be
doubted, he said, but that they weft
overjoyed to see him (it seems he was
the principal man among them, tuo
captain of the vessel they had been
shipwrecked in having been dead some
time); they were, he said, the more
surprised to see him,- becausethey
knew that he was fallen into the hand*
©f the savages, who, they were satisfi*
ed, would devour him, as they did all th#
rest of their prisoners; that when hi
told them the story of Ms deliverance^
and in what manner he was furnished
for carrying them away, itwaa like1'*
dream to tfietn, and their aaf ontehment
he said^ was somewhat like that «f
Joseph's brethren, when he told them
who lie was, and told them the storf
of his exaltation in Pharaoh's court;
but when he showed them the arms*
the powder* the  ball, and prdfislonsi
that he brought them for their jouritef
or voyage, they were restored to then**,
selves, and took a just share of the joy
in their deliverance, and imraediatefy

'ADVENTURES OF
 
morning.' It'seems they'wanted too
time'to' get themselves read?; for they
had .no baggage,' neither clothes nor
provisions, nor any 'thing in the world
but what they had on them, and a few
rtots to eat, of which they used to
male their bread.
They were in ail three weeks absent;
and in that time, unluckily for them,
I had the occasion offered for my es-
cape, as I mentioned in my other part,
and to: get  off from the island, leaving
three of the most impudent, hardened,
ungovemcd, disagreeable villains be-
hind me, that any man could desire to
meet with; to the poor Spaniards'
great grief and disappointment, you
may be sure.
.The only just thing the rogues did
was, that when the Spaniards came
ashore, they gave my letter to them,
and gave them  provisions,' and other
relief, as 1 had ordered them to do $
also they gate them the long paper of
directions' which 1 had left' with them,
containing * the particular methods
which I took for managing every part
of my life there; , the way how 1 bake-
ed my bread, bred op tame goats, and
planted 'my eorn^ how 1 "cured my
grapes, made my pots, and, in a word,
every thing 1 did; all this being writ-
ten Sown, they gave to the Spaniards
(two of them understood English well
enough): nor- did they refuse to' ae-
eoitoniod&te the' Spaniards with an?
thiilg eke, for they agreed very well
for some time. They gave them an
equal 'admission into the house, or
cave, and they began to live very socia-
lly j and the head Spaniard, who had
sN&n'pretty much of my methods, and
Friday** father together, managed all
their1 affairs: but 'as for the English-
men, they did nothing but ramble
$bcmt the island, shoot parrots, and
fc&teli tortoises;' and when they came
feoinfe. at night, the Spaniards provided
their suppers tor them,
'- ;"The Spaniards'would have been sa-
te§M,;' with' this, had the' others but
let them alone j which, however,, they
cbiild not find in their hearts' to do long,
"to,.'liie'the:dogia,the manger, they
w%uld'hot eat themselves, neither would
fhe| fettle'others eat. 'The differences,
l^teMeliis; !;wef e* at "first -but: trivial,
and such as are not worth relating, lit
at last it broke out into open war: and
it began with all the rudeness  and in-
solence that can be imagined, without
reason, without provocation, contrary
to nature, and, indeed, to common
sense: and though, it is true* the first
relation of it came from the Spaniards
themselves, whom 1 may call the ac-
cusers, yet when I came to examine
the fellows, they could not deny a word'
of if.
But before I come to the 'particulars"
of this part, 1 must supply a defect in'
my former relation; and this was, 1
forgot to set clown, among the rest, that
just as we were weighing the anchor to
set sail, there happened a little quarrel
on board of our ship, which I was once
afraid would have turned to a second
mutiny; nor was it appeased till the
captain, rousing up his- 'Courage, and
taking us all to his assistance, parted
them by force, and making two of the-
most refractory fellows prisoners,* 'hi
laid them in irons; and m' they had
been active in the former disorders, and
let fail some ugly, dangerous  word%
the second time he threatened'' to  carry
them in irons to England* and have
them hanged therefor mutiny, and'run-
ning away with the ship.  This, it
seems, though the captain did not in*
tend to do it, frightened tome other
men in the ship; and some of them
had put into the heads of the rest that
the captain only gave them good words
for the present, till they should come
to some English port, and that then
they should be ail put into gaol, and
tried for their lives. The mate got in-
telligence of this, and acquainted us
with it | upon' which it was desired that
I, who still passed for a great 'man
among them, should-go down with
the mate, and satisfy the men, and tell
them that they might be assured, if they
behaved well the - rest of the voyage,
all they had done for;:the time past
should be pardoned. SoTwent,- and
after passing my honour's word-  to
them, 'they 'appeared -easy,' mud'the
more so when I caused the two--men
that were in irons "to be'-released and
forgiven, * •  •' •.•.':..... .-:-'

felling calm. next morning, we found
that our two men who had.been laid in
irons had'Stole each of them a musket,
and some other weapons (what powder
or shot they-had we knew not), and had
taken-the chip's pinnace, which was
not yet' hauled up, and run away with
her to their companions in roguery on
shore. As soon as we found this, I
ordered the long-boat on shore, with
twelve men and the mate, and away
they went to seek the rogues; hut they
could neither find them or any of- the
irest, for they ail fled into the woods
when they saw the boat coming on
shore* The mate was once resolved,
in justice to their roguery, to have de-
stroyed their plantations, burned all
their household-stuff and furniture, and
left them to shift without it; but
having no orders, he let it ail alone,
left every thing as he found it, and
bringing the pinnace away, came on
board without them. These two men
made their number five 5 but the other
three villains were so much more
wieked than they, that after they had
been two or three days together, they
turned the two new-comers out of
doors to shift for themselves, and
would have nothing to do with them;
nor could they, for a good while, be
persuaded to give them any food: • as
for; the Spaniards, they were not yet
come. * , ,
;  When the Spaniards -came irst on
shortj, the. business, began to go - for-
ward :'. the Spaniards would have per-
waded the three English brutes to have
taken in their two countrymen - again,
that, as they said, they might be all
one family; but they would not hear
of it: so the two poor fellows lived by
themselves; and finding nothing but
industry and application would make
them.,, live comfortably, they pitched
their tents on the north shore of the
island,  but- a little more to the west, to
be. out of danger of. the savages, who
alirmyi landed, on the east part of the
island. •
Here they built them two huts, one
to lodge in, and the other to lav up
their ^magazines and stores in; ana the
Spaniards having given them ooine
corn 4m. seed^ and eipecialy some of
ibfrpeas which 1 had, left them, they
dug, planted, and enclosed, after the ,
pattern 1 had set for them all, and be-
gan to live pretty well Their first;
crop of corn was -on the ground;, and,-
though it was but a little, bit of land'
which the? had dug up .at first, having,
had but a little time, yet it was enough'"
to relieve them, ,and find them .with
bread and other eatables; and one,of
the fellows being the cook's-mate. of
the ship, was very ready at making*
soup, puddings, and such other prepa-
rations as the rice and the milk, and
such little flesh as they got, furnished
him to do.
They were going on in this little
thriving posture, when the three un-
natural rogues, their own countrymen
too, in mere humour, and to insult
them, came and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs; that the
governor, meaning me, had given them
the possession of it, and nobody else
had any right to it;, and that they
should build no houses upon their
ground, unless they would pay rent for
them.
The two men, thinking they were
jesting at irst, asked them to come in
and sit down, and see what Ine houses
they were, that they had built, and to,
tell them what rent they demanded;
and one of them merrily said, if they
were the ground-landlords, lie hoped*
if they built tenements upon their land,
and made improvements, they would,
according to the custom of landlords;,
grant a long lease: and desired they
would get a scrivener to draw the writ-
ings. One of the three, cursing and
raging, told them they should see they
were not in jest j and going to a little
place at a distance, where the honest men
had made a fire to dress their victuals,
he takes a firebrand, and claps it to'the
outside of their hut, and very fairly., set
it on fire; and it. would have been '.all
burnt down in a few minutes, if,one, of
the two had not run to the fellow^
thrust him away, and trod the lire out
with his feet, and that not. without
some difficulty too. „ ..,.,., [•
The fellow was in such, a rage at the
honest man's thrusting him away, that
he returned upon'htm, with a .pole, lie
 had in. bis hand, and had' not the mm
avoided the'blow Very "nimbly, and'run
 
 
ADVENTURES .OF
into the' hut, he had ended bis days at
©ace. His comrade, seeing* the danger
they were both in, ran in -after him,
aod immediately they came hoth -out
with their muskets, ,and the man that
was first struck 'at with the pole,
knocked the fellow down that had be-
gun the quarrel with the *tock of hk
ihusket, and' that before the cither two
could come to help him; and then see-
ing the rest come at-them, they stood
together, and presenting the other ends
of their pieces to them, bade them
stand off.
The others had fire-arms with them
too; but one of the two honest men,
bolder than his comrade, and made
desperate bv his danger, told them, if
they offered to muve hand or foot they
were dead men, and boldly commanded
them to lay down their arms. They
did not, indeed, lay down -their arms,
but seeing- him so resolute, it brought
them to a parley, and they consented
to take their wounded man with
them .and be gone; and, indeed, it
seems the fellow was wounded suffi-
ciently with the blow. However, they
jwere,„rnuch in the-wrong, since they
had.;the advantage, that ,they .did not
disarm them effectually, as they might
have done, and have gone immediately
to the Spaniards, and ,gi?en them an
jaeeouttt how the rogues had treated
them;.for the three villain* studied
.nothing, but revenge, and every day
fare them some intimation that they
id ,so.

Jfttheyfot.up in the morahig before
 
 
day, and came to the place,'*nd called
the Englishmen by -their names, tel-
ling a .Spaniard that answered thai
they wanted to speak with them.
It happened that the day before, two
of the Spaniards, having been in the
woods, had seen one of the two English-
men, whom, for distinction, I culled
the honest men, and he had made a sad
complaint to the Spaniards of the bar-
barous usage they had met with from
their three countrymen, and how they
liad ruined their plantation, and des-
troyed their corn that they had laboured
so hard.to bring forward, and killed
the milch-goat and their three kids,
which was all they had provided for
their sustenance; and that if lie and
Ms "friends, meaning the Spaniards, did
not assist them again, they should be
starved. When the Spaniards came
home night, and they were ail at sup-
per, one of them took the freedom to
reprove the three Englishmen, though
in very gentle and mannerly terms, and
asked them how they could be so cruel,
they being harmless, inoffensive fel-
lows; that they were putting - them-
selves in a way to subsist by their la-
bour, and that it-had cost them a great
deal of pains to bring things to such
perfection as they were then in.
One of the Englishmen returned
very briskly, What had they to do
there? that they came on shore with-
out leave; and that they should not
planter build upon the island; it wag
nonc^of their ground. Why, says'lie
Spaniard, very calmly, Seignor Inglese,
they roust not starve. The1-English-
man replied, like a rough-hewn tar-
pauling, They might starve .and be
d~——d$ they should not plant nor
build in that place, But .-what 'must
they do then, seignior? said -the -Spani-
ard. Another or the brutes .returned,
Do? ,dV-~-n them, the? should-be ser-
vants, -and work for them. But how
can you expect that &i them? «ays the
Spaniard; they are not -bought with
your money: y©u have no right to
-make-them- servants. The '-English-
man .answered, the island was-theiis;
-the governor had given it to them, - and
•no.man*had any thing to -do -there but
themselves; and with that* swore hy
his Maker -that they would 'go and hum
 
 
 
 
175
 
 
all their new huts j they should • build
none upon their land. Why, seignior,
says the Spaniard* by the same rule,
we must be your servants too.—Aye,
says the -bold dog, and so you shall loo,
before we have done with yon; (mix-
ing two or three G—d d~-n me's in
the proper intervals of his .speech).
The Spaniard only smiled at that, and
made him no answer. However, this
little discourse had heated them; ami,
starting1 up, one says to the oilier, I
think it was he they called Will Atkins,
Come, Jack, let's go, and have t'other
brush with *em; we'll demolish their
castle, I'll warrant you they shall plant
no colony in our dominions.
Upon this they went all trooping
away, with every man a gun, a pistol,
and a sword, and muttered some inso-
lent things among1 themselves, of what
they would do to the Spaniards, too,
when opportunity offered; but the
Spaniards, it seems, did not so per-
fectly understand them as to know all
the particulars, only that, in general,
they threatened them hard for taking
the two Englishmen's part.
Whither they went, or how they bes-
towed their time that evening, the Spa-
niards said they did not know; but it
seems they wandered about the country
part -of the night, and then lying down
in the -place which 1 used to call my
bower, they1 were weary, and overslept
themselves. The case was this; they
had resolved to stay till midnight, and
so. to take-the two poor men when they
were, asleep, and,,as they acknowledged
afterwards, intended to set fire to their
huts -while they were in them, and
either burn them there, or murder
them as they came out; as malice sel-
dom sleeps -very sound, it was very
strange they should not have beem kept
awake,
 However as the two men had also a
desiga upon' them, as I have said,
•though a much fairer one than .that of
burning and murdering, it happened,
•and very luckily for them all, that they
 were • .up, and gone  abroad, before the
'bloodytmiftded rogues came to their
 huts.  : 
 : When- they 'came there, and found
the men gone, Atkins, who, it seems,
'Was the forwarded -man, called out to
his comrade, Ha, lack, here's-the1 nest,
but, d*—h them, the birds are flown.
The? mused awhile, to think what
should be-the occasion of their being
gone abroad so soon,. and suggested
presently that the Spaniards had given
them notice of it; and with that they
shook hands, and swore to one another
that they would be revenged of the
Spaniards. As soon as they had made
this bloody bargain, they fell to work
with the poor men's habitation; they
did not set ire, indeed, to any thing,
but they pulled down both their
houses, and pulled them so limb from
limb, that they left not the least stick
standing, or scarce any sign on the
ground where they stood t they tore all
their little collected household-stuff in
pieces, and threw every thing about In
such a manner, that the poor men af-
terwards found some of their things a
mile off their habitation. When they
had done this, they pulled up ail the
young trees which the poor' men
had planted; pulled up an enclosure
they had made to secure their cattle
and their corn; and, in a word, sacked
and plundered every thing as com-
pletely as a horde of Tartars would have
done.

who'was 'but one, so -they had little to
do, when they were willing to rise, but
to get up upon their feet, and perhaps
put on a coat,.such as It was, and their
pumps, and they were ready for' going
any way that their thoughts guided
them. 'Being thus got up, he looked
'out;' but,' being dark, he could see
little or nothing, and besides, the
"Wees which 1 had planted, as in my
former account is described, and which
were now grown tall, intercepted his
'eight, so that ho could only look vm,
and see that it was a clear star-light
night, and hearing no noise, he return-
ed and laid him down again: but it
was, all one, he could not sleep nor could
'Be compose himself to any thing like
rest; but his thoughts were to the last
degree uneasy and he knew not for what.
'Having made some noise with rising
and walking about, going out and
'coming, in, another of them waked,
'and calling, asked who it was that was
itp. The governor told him how it
'had been 'with him. Say you so?
says the other Spaniard; such things
'Ire not "to be slignted, I assure you;
there "is certainly some mischief'work-
ing near US'; and present!?' he asked
;hjin» Where are the Englishmen?
—They ire ' all in their huts, says he,
safe''enough.' It seems the Spaniards
:had kept possession of the main apart-
tt&rit, aha had made a place for the
'three .'Englishmen, who, since their
'last;mutiny,were always quartered by
''themselves*''and could not eome at the

none of my cautions, to go up  .by the
ladder, and puling it up-after'weft,
to go up a second stage to the top,
but were going round through Jbe
grove, unconcerned and unwary, when
they were surprised with' seeing. ,a
light as of Ire, a very little way _ off
from them, and 'hearing the voices of
men, not of one or two, but of" a
great number.
In all the discoveries 1 had made of
the savages landing on the island, it
was my constant care to prevent them
making the least discovery of there
being any inhabitant upon the place;
and when bv any occasion they came
to know it, they 'felt it so effectually,
that they that got away were .scarce
able to give any account of it; for we
disappeared as soon as possible; nor
did ever any that had seen me escape
to tell any one else, except it was the
three savages in our last encounter,
who jumped into the boat; i of whom,
I mentioned, I was afraid they should
go home and bring more help. Whether
it was the consequence of the escape
of those men that so great a number
came now together, or whether they
came ignorantly, and by accident, on
their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards
could not, it seems,^understand; but,
whatever it was, it* had been their
'business either to have concealed
themselves, or not to have seen thepi
at all, much less to have let the
savages have seen that there were any
inhabitants in the place;' or to have
fallen upon them so effectually, as
that not a roan of them should have
escaped, which could only'have been
by getting in' between them and their
boats: but tliis presence of mind was
wanting to them, which was the Mm
of their tranquility for a great-white.
We need not doubt, but that the
governor and the map, with him, sur-
prised with this sight, ran back im-
mediately, and raised • their' fellows,
'giving them an account of the imminent
danger they, were all in, and they again
as readily took the alarm j but it was im-
possible to persuade them to stay close
within where they were, but they must
all run out to see how things stood.
While it was dark, indeed, they were
well enough, and' they, 'had, opportunity
! -;u
 
 
eiioufli, for some hours, to view them
by the light of three ires* they had
made at a distance from one another;
what they were doing they knew not,
arid what to do themselves they knew
not, For, first, the enemy were too
many; and, secondly, they did not
keep together, but were divided into
several parties, and were on shore in
several places.
The Spaniards were in no small con-
sternation at this sight; and as they
found that, the fellows ran straggling
all over the shore, they made no doubt
but, first or last, some of them would
chop in upon their habitation, or upon
some other place where they would
see the token of inhabitants: and they
were in ^reat perplexity also for fear
of their flock of goats, which would
have been little less than starving
them, if they should have been de-
stroyed; so the first thing they re-
solved upon was, to dispatch three
men away before it was light, two
Spaniards and one Englishman, to
drive all the goats away to the great
'valley where the cave was, and, if need
were, to drive them into the very cave
itself. Could they have seen the
savages all together In one body, and
at a distance from their canoes, they
resolved, if there had been a hundred
of them, to have attacked them; but
that could not be obtained; for they
were some of them two miles off
from the' other: and, as it appeared
afterwards,, were of two different na-
tions,
After having mused a great while
, on' the i course they should take, and
beating* their brains in considering
their present circumstances, the? re-
solved, at last, while it was still dark,
to send the old savage, Friday's father,
out'as-a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them; as what
they came  for9 what they intended to
do, and the like. The old man readily
undertook it; and stripping himself
quite naked, as' most of the savages
were, away he went. After he had
'been gone an hour or two,' he brings
word that he had been among them
^ .undiscovered $ that he found fhey were
; two, parties, and of two several nations,
who ''had war with one another, and
had a great battle in their own-cfttuitry
and that both sides having .had several
frtaoners taken in the. fight, they wen\
y mere chance, landed, all on ihr
same island, for the devouring'th<'ir
prisoners and ..roakiug merry, but tbHr
coming so by chance to the same plun*
had spiled all their mirth; that th^y
were m a great rage at one another,
and wep so near, that he believed
they would fight again as soon as day-
light began to appear j but he did not
perceive that they had any notion
of any body being on the island'hut
themselves. He had hardly made as
.end of telling his story, when they
could perceive, by the unusual nolle
they made, that tne two little armies
were engaged in a bloody fight.
Friday's father used all the .argu-
ments he could to persuade Our people
to lie close, and not be seen; he told
.them their safety consisted in it, and
that they had nothing to do but to lie
still,. and the savages would kill one
another to their hands, and then .the
rest would go away$ and it ivas so to
a tittle. But it was impossible to
prevail, especially upon the English-
men; their curiosity was so impor-
tunate upon their prudentials, that
they must run out and see the battle:
however, they used some caution too,
viz. they did not go openly, jtwt by
their own dwelling, but went farther
into the woodi, and placed themselves
to advantage, where they might securely
see them manage the .fight/find,,'.#8
they thought, not be seen-uy'them;
bat it seems the savages did $ee. them,
as we shall find hereafter.
The battle was very fierce; and,If.I
might believe the Englishmen* one of
them said he could perceive, that some
of them ivere men of great bravery,
of invincible'spirits,' and of'great po-
licy in guiding the fight. The battle,
they said, held two hours before they
could guess which party would, he
, beaten; but then that party which wn§
nearest our people's, habitation began
-to appear weakest, and, after some
time more,a some of them began to
%';"' and this put oiir men again .into

ADVENTURES OF
and .-thereby involuntarily discover the
place j- 'and" that, by consequence, the
pnnue^ would do the like in search of
them. Upon this they resolved that
they .would stand armed within the
wall* and whoever came-into the grove,
they resolved to sally out oyer the
wau and kill them; so that, if possible,
aot one should return lo give -an ac-
count of it; they ordered also that it
-should he done with their swords, or
by knocking them down with the
stocks of their muskets, but not by
shooting them, for fear of raising an
alarm-by the noise*
As they expected, it fell out: three
of the routed army fled for life, and
crossing* - the creek, ran directly into
the place, not in the least .knowing
•whither they went, but running as
•into a thick wood for shelter. The
scout they kept to look abroad gave
'notice of this within, with this" ad-
dition, to our men's great satisfaction,
viz. "that the conquerors had not -pnr-
smed' them, or seen which way they
were gone $ upon this, the Spaniard
governor, a man of humanity, would
not .puffer Aim to kill the three fu-
gitives, but sending three men out by
the- top -of the hill, ordered them to
go-round, come in behind them, and
surprise and take theni prisoners;
which'was'done. The residue of the
•conquered people led to their canoes-,
-and got ol to sea j th& victors retired,
made no pursuit* or very little, but
-ifatwijig themselves into -a-body to-
.gether, gave two great screaming
ahouls, which they supposed was by
way of triumph, and so the fight
ended-; and the same day, about three
o'clock-'in the - afternoon, they also
marched to their canoes. - And thus
the Spaniards had their island again
free to themselves, their fright was
over, and they saw no savages in several
years after.
- 'After they- were all gone, the Spa*,
niards -came out of their den, and view-
Ing,.tlie Md of battle, they found about
two-and thirty men dead on the spot:
-some' were killed with great- -long ar-
rows* some of which were- found stick-
ing 4n:thei& bodies; but most of them
were' killed. wlA-great *woodea 'swords,
*ixte*n orsoretoteen of which they found
in the field if battle, and at'many
bows, with a great many arrows.  These
swords were strange, great unwieldy
things, and they must be very -strong
men that used them: most of those
men that were killed with them had
their heads mashed to pieces, as we may
sayf or, as we call it m English, their
brains knocked out,-and several their
arms and legs broken; so that it is evi-
dent they fight with inexpressible rage
and fury* We found not one man that
was not stone-dead, for either they stay
by their enemy till they have quite killed
him, or they carry all the wounded
men that are not quite dead away with
them.
This deliverance tamed our English-
men for a great while; the sight had
filled them with horror, and the con-
sequences appeared terrible to -the last
degree, especially upon supposing that
some time or other they should fall in-
to the' hands of those creature, who
would not only kill them as enemies,
but kill them *for food, as we kill our
cattle 5 and they professed to me, that
the thoughts of being eaten up like beef
or mutton, though it was supposed it
was not to be till they were dead, had
something in it so horrible, that it nau-
seated their -very stomachs, made them
sick when they thought of it, and filled
their minds with such unusual terror,
that they were not themselves for some
'weeks after. This, as I said, tamed
even the three English brutes 1 -have
been speaking of, and, for agreat while
after, they were tractable, and went
about the* common business of the
whole society well enough; planted,
sowed, reaped, and- began to be all
naturalised to the country. But some
time after this, they fell into such
simple measures again, as brought
them into a great deal of trouble.
They had taken three prisoners,
as I observed; and these' three being
lusty, stout young fellows, they made
them servants, and taught them to •
- work for them; '-and, as slaves,-they
.did well enough; but they did not
-take their measures with them -as
•I did by. my man Friday, viz, to
begin with them upon . the principle
.-of having saved their < lives, and
then- instruct them in the- rational
 
J#l
 
principles of life; much less of re-
ligion, civilizing, and reducing them by
kind usage and affectionate arguings";
but as they gave them their food every
day, so they gave them their work too,
and kept them fully employed in
drudgery enough; but they failed in
this by it, that they never had them to
assist them, and fight for them, as 1
had my man Friday, who was as true
to me as the very flesh upon my bones.
But to come to the family part.
Being all now goodfriend*.,for common
danger, as I said above, had effectually
reconciled them, they began to consi-
der their general circumstances; and
the first thing that came under their
consideration was, whether, seeing the
savages particularly haunted that side
of the island, and that there were more
remote and retired parts of it equally
adapted to their way of living, and ma-
nifestly to their advantage, they should
not rather move their habitation, and
plant in some more jfroper place for their
safely, and especially for the security of
their cattle and corn.
Upon this, after long debate, it was
concluded that they would not remove
their habitation; because that, some
time or other, they thought they might
hear from their- governor again, mean-
ing me; and if 1 should send any one
to seek them,! should be sure to direct
them to that side; where,if they should
find the place demolished, they would
conclude the savages had killed us all,
and we were gone, and so our supply
would go too. But as to their corn
and cattle, they agreed to remove them
into the valley where my cave was,
where the land was as proper for
both, and where, indeed, there was-
land enough: however, upon second
thoughts, they altered one part of their
resolution too, and resolved only to re-
move part of their cattle thither, and
plant part of their com there; and so
if>one part-.was destroyed, the other
might be saved. And one part of pru-
dence they used, which it was very-
well they cud,,viz. that they never trust-
ed^ those three savages, which they had
prisoners, with'knowing any thing of
the plantation they had made in that
valley, or -of any cattle they had-there,
much. less< of the mm tnere*. which.
they kept, in case of necessity,' if %
safe retreat \   and' thither" they carriel
also the two barrels of powder which'I.
hud sent them1 at my coming away.
But, however, they resolved -not -to
change their habitation; yet they
agreed, that at? 1 'had carefully covered
it first-with a wall or fortification, and
then with a grove -of trees, so seeing
their safety consisted entirely in thcit
being concealed, of which they wenft
now fully convinced, they set to- Work
to cover* and conceal the place yet
more effectually than before. For this
purpose, as I planted trees, or rather;
thrust in stakes, which in time all
grew up to be trees, for some good
distance before the entrance  into my
apartments, they went on in the same
manner, and filled up the rest of that
whole space of ground, from- the trees
1 had set, quite down to the side of the
creek, where, as I said, I landed my
floats, and even into" the very ooza
where the tide- flowed, not so much al
leaving any place' to land, or any sign
that there had been any landing there-
about ; these stakes also being of a wood
very forward to grow, as 1 nave noted
formerly, they took care to have them'
generally much larger and-taller thatt
those which I had planted; and as they
grew apace, so they planted them so
very thick and close together, that
when they had been three- or fouf
years grown, there was-no piercing
with the'eye" any considerable way into
the plantation: and, as for that part
which 1 had planted, the- trees were
grown  as thick as a man's thigh, and
among them they placed so many other 
short ones, and so thick, that, in <*
word, it stood like a pallisado a'quartet
of 'a mile thick, and it was next to in**
possibleto penetrate it, but with a little;'
army to cut it all down;-for aiittle dog-
could hardly get 'between the tfees, they
stood so close.
But this was not all;' for they did
the same by all the ground' to- the right
hand and to the left,'and round eveft
to the top of the  hill, leaving -no way,
not 'So much as for themselves' to
come.out, but by the- ladder-plaeed up'-

It, could come at them. This was
.excellently well contrived; nor was it
less than what  they afterwards found

me, that as human prudence has the
authority of Providence to justify it,
10 it  has doubtless the direction of
'Providence to set it to work 5 and if
we listened carefully to the voice of
it, 1 am persuaded we might prevent
many of the disasters which our lives
are now, by our own negligence, sub-
jected to: but this by the way.
I -return to the story.—-They lived
two years after this in perfect retire-
ment, and had no more visits from the
savages. They had indeed, an alarm
given them one morning, which put
them into a great consternation; for
some of the Spaniards being out early
one morning on the west side, or
rather end, of the island (which was
that end where I never went, for fear
of being discovered), they were sur-
prised with seeing above twenty canoes
of Indians just coining on shore! They
made the best of their way home, in
hurry.enough; and giving the alarm
to their comrades, they kept close all
that: day and the next, going out only
at night to make their observation:
but they had the good luck to be mis-
taken; for wherever the savages went,
they did -not land' that time on the
island, but pursued some other de-
sign;
- And' now they had another broil
with the three Englishmen; one of
whom, a most 'turbulent fellow, being
in  a rage at one of the three slaves,
which 1 mentioned they had taken,
because the fellow had not done some-
thing right which he bid him do, and
seemed- a little untractable in his
showing Mm, drew a hatchet out of a
frog-belt, in which he wore it by his
side,-  and fell upon the poor savage,
not to correct him, but to kill him*
One of' the Spaniards* who was by,
seeing him give the fellow a barbarous 
-cut"with the hatchet, which' he aimed
at. his  head, but struck into his
shoulders, m that he thought he had
jcul the .poor creature's arm oJF* ran
;t« km, :'«&&• entreating. 'him 'mot to
murder the poor''man, placed-him-
self between'trim and tire savage, to
prevent the mischief. The fellow be-
ing enraged the more at this, struck
at the Spaniard with his hatchet,
and swore he would serve him as'he
intended to serve the savage; which
the Spaniard |>erceiving, avoided the
blow, and with a shove) which he had
in his hand (for they were ail working
in the ield about their corn-land),
knocked the brute down. Another of
the Englishmen running at the same
time to help his comrade, knocked the
Spaniard down; and then two Spani-
ards more came in to help their man,
and a third Englishman fell in upon
them. They had none of them any
fire-arms, or any other weapons but
hatchets and other tools, except this
third Englishman; he had one of
my rusty cutlasses, -with which he
made at the two last Spaniards, and
wounded them botk This fray set the
whole family in an uproar, and more-
help coming in, they took the three
Englishmen prisoners. The next ques-
tion was, what should be clone with
them? They had been so often muti-
nous, and were so very furious, so des-
perate, and so idle withal, they knew
not what course to take with them, for
they were mischievous to the highest
degree* and valued not what hurt they
did'to any man; so that, in short, it
was not safe to live with them.
The Spaniard who was governor
told them, in so many words, that if
they had been of hk own country, he
would have hanged them; for all laws
and all governors were to preserve so-
ciety, and those who were dangerous
to the society ought to be expelled out
of it; but as they were Englishmen,
and that it was to the generous kind-
ness of an Englishman that'they all
owed their preservation and delive-
rance, he would um them with ail pos-
sible lenity, and would leave them to
the judgment of the other two English-
men, mho were their countrymen.
One of the two honest Englishmen
stood up, and said they desired it might
not be left to them; For says he; I am
sure we ought to sentence them to the
. gallows:. and with that he givei *n ac-
count -how 'Will<Atkin*t «ne"of the
 
 
163
ihitee, had proposed to have all the ive
Englishmen join together, and murder
ail'the Spaniards when they were in
their sleep.' 
When the Spanish governor heard
this, he calls to Will Atkins, Mow,
Seignior Atkins, .would yew murder us
all?" What have you to say to that?
The hardened villain was so far from
denying it, that lie said it was true:
and* (I—(1 d-~n him, they would do it
still, before they hud clone with them.
Well, hut Seignior Atkins, says the
Spaniard, what have we done to yon,
that you will kill us? And what would
you get by killing us? And what must
we do to prevent your killing us? Must
we kill you, or you kill us? Why will
you put us to the necessity of this,
Seignior Atkins, says the Spaniard,
very calmly and smiling. Seignior At-
kins was in - such a rage at the Spa-
niard's making a jest of it, that, had he
not been held by three men, and
withal had no weapon near him, it was
thought he would have attempted to
have killed'the Spaniard in the middle
of all the company. This hair-brain
carriage obliged them to consider seri-
ously "what was to be done: the two
Englishmen, and the Spaniard who
saved the poor savage, were of the opi-
nion that they should hang one of the
three, for an example to the rest; * and
that particularly it should be he that
had twice attempted to commit murder
with his hatchet; and, indeed, there was
some reason to believe he had done
it, for the poor savage was in such
a miserable condition with the wound
lie had received, that it was thought
he could not live. But the governor
Spaniard still said no; it was an English-
man that had saved all their lives, and
lie would never consent to put an
Englishman to death, though he had
murdered half of them; nay, he said,
if lie  had been killed himself by an
Englishman, and had time left to speak,
it -should be that they should parddh him.
•This ww so positively insisted on by
the governor Spaniard, that there was
bo gainsaying it; and as merciful coun-
sels are most apt to prevail, where
-they .we so earnestly pressed, so they
 :«Hcmpe mta.ft *r -twttten it wm to be.
:" iDonsMered'>>wbit:BlM»uld--he;dojie to
keep them from doing tl» mischief
they designed; for all'agreed* gover-
nor and ail, that.means were to1 be
used- for preserving the society from
danger. After a long debate, it was
agreed, first, that they should be dig-
armed, and not permitted to have either
gun, powder, shot, sword, or .any'Wea-
pon; and should be turned out of the so-
ciety, and left to live where they would,
and how they would, by themselves;
but that none of the rest, either Spa-
niards or English, should converse
with them, speak with them, or have
any thing to do with them: that they
should be forbid to come within a cer-
tain distance of the place where the
rest dwelt; and if they offered to com-
mit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn,
kill, or destroy any of the corn, plant-
ings, buildings, fences, or cattle  be-
longing to the society, they should die
without mercy, and they would shoot
them wherever they could ind them.
The governor, a man < of great hu-
manity, musing upon the sentence,
considered a little upon it; and turning
to the two honest Englishmen, said,
Hold; you must releet that it will
be long ere they can raise com and
cattle of their own, and they must
not starve; we must therefore allow
them provisions: so he caused to be
added, that they should have a pro-
portion of corn given them to' last
them eight months, and for seed to
sow, by which time they might be sup-
posed to raise some of their own-j that
they should have six milch-goats, four
he-goats, and six kids given them, as
well for present subsistence as for a
store | and that they should  have tools
given them for their work in the fields,
such as six hatchets, an adze, <a saw,
and the like; but they should have
none of these tools or provisions,- un-
less they would swear solemnly  that
they would not hurt or injure an? of
the Spaniards with them* or of tneir
fellow Englishmen.
Thus they dismissed them the so-
ciety, and turned them out to shift for
themselves. They went' away .sullen
and refractory, as neither content to go
away nor to stay ;* but,,.as' there• was no
• remedy,;. they went, pretending'to go
and chooft'trplice where .they would

stettte themselves; aid-some provisions
were given-'them, but tit© weapons.
About faur or fire days after, they
came' again for some victuals* and gave
the governor an account where they
had pitched their tents, and marked
themselves- out a habitation1 and plan-
tation j and it was a very convenient
place, indeed, on the remotest part of
the island, N. E. much about the place
inhere I providentially landed in my
first voyage, when Iwas driven out lo
ses» the.- Cord alone knows whither, in
my- feofeh attempt to sail round the
island.
Here' they built' thetnleivea two
handle®*, huts,, and contrived them in
a maimer like my first habitation, be-
ing close under the. side of a' hill,,
having mme trees growing already on
three aides of it, so that hj planting-
others, i| would he very easily covered,
from the Bight, unless narrowly searched
for. They desired some dried goats'-
skins- for beds and covering, which
wem given' them; and upon giving
their words that they wouhl not disturb'
the rest, or injure any of tlieir planta-
tions* they gave the® hatchets, and
what other "tools they -could spare ;-
some, p^m, barley, and' rice, for sow-
ing;' and, la- a word, any thing they
wai$td^ except arms and-ammunition.
'f hey 'lived in this separate, condition
about six months* and had got in their
fiisfr harvest, though the quantity was
but small* the- parcel of land they had
planted being but little; for, indeed,
liavfef all their plantation to form,
they- lad a great deal of work upon
their bands; and when they came to
make-hoards and pots, and" such things,
they were quite out' of tlieir element,
and could make nothing of it: and
when the rainy season came on, for
want of a care in the-earth, they could
not ke^p their grain-dry, and it was- in
fiieaft 'danger of  spoiling; and this
, united theni- much: so they, came
and begged the Spaniards to-befpfhiin,
which '-they very, readily did; and-: in
four*.days--.worked a 'great: hole- in- the
9ide-of the- hill for-them, 'big/enough to

made several new apartments' in it*
Abont three quarter* of a year after
this separation, a new frolic tool these
rogues, which, together with the for-
mer villainy they had committed,
brought mischief enough upon them,
and had very near been the ruin of the
whole colony. The three -new- asso-
dates'began* it seems, to be weary of-
the laborious life they led, and that
without hope of bettering tlieir cir-
cumstances; and a whim'took them,
that they-would make a voyage to Ike
continent, from whence tie savages
came, and would try if the? coaldsekie-
upon some prisoners among the natives-'
there, and bring them home, so to/
make them do the laborious part- of
their work for them'.  ''
The project was not so preposterous,
if they had gone 11© farther; but they
did nothing, and proposed'nothing, but
had either mischief in the design, or
mischief in the event: and, if I may
give my opinion, they seemed to be
tinder a blast from Heaven; for if we
will not allow a visible curse to pursue
visible crimes, how shall we reconcile
the events, of things with the divine,
justice? It was certainly an apparent
vengeance on their crime of mutiny
and" piracy that brought them to the
state'the? were in; and they- showed
not the least remorse for the crime,
but added new vilktiies to it, such' as
the piece of monstrous- cruelty of
wounding a poor slave* because he did
not, or perhaps could not, understand to
do what he was directed, and 10 wound
him in such a manner as made him a
cripple all his life, aid in a plaas
where no surgeon or medicine could
be had for his cure; and what was;stilt
worse, the murderous intent; or, to do
justice' to the crime, the intentional
murder, for such to be sure it was, as
was-afterwards the'formed' design iiey
all laid;. to.> murder the Sp«iiards in

came over 11,1, and give them 11mm and
ammunition proportioned to their de-
fence, they would go over to the main
and seek their fortunes, and so deliver
them from the trouble of supplying
them with any other provisions.
The Spaniards were glad enough to
get rid of tlieiii, hut very honestly re-
presented to them the certain destruc-
tion they were, running" into; told them
they had suffered such hardships upon
that very, spot, that they could, with-
out any spirit of prophecy, tell them
they would he starved, or murdered,
and hade them consider of it.
The men replied audaciously, they
should he starved if they staid here,
for they could not work, and would
not work, and they could but he
starved abroad; and if they were mur-
dered* .there was an end of them; they
had no wives or children to cry after
them-: and, in short, insisted importu-
nately- upon their demand; declaring
they would go, whether they would
give them any anus or no.
The Spaniards told them, with great
Mildness, that if they were resolved to-
go, they-«hou>ld not go like naked men,,
and be in no condition to defend them-
selves: and that though they could ill
spare their fire-arms, having not enough
for themselves, yet they would let
them have two muskets,,a.pistol and a
cutlass,,-and each man a hatchet, which
the$ thought was sufficient for them.
In '% word, they accepted the offer;
and baying- baked them bread enough*

ADVENTURES "OF
 
the feopte alarmed at their coming,
and. preparing with bows and arrows to
fight them, they durst not go on shore,
but sailed on to the northward six or
seven hours, till they came to a great
opening", by which they perceived that
the land they saw from our island was
not the main, hut an island; upon enter-
ing that opening of the sea, they saw
another island on the right hand,
north, and several more west; and be-
ing resolved to land somewhere, they
put o?er to one of the islands which
lay west, and went boldly on shore:
that they found the people very cour-
teous and friendly to them; and that
they gave the in several roots and some
dried fish, and appeared very sociable;
and Ihe women as well as the men,
were very forward to supply them
with any thing they could get for them
to eat, and brought it to them a great
way upon their heads.
They continued here four days; and
inquired, as well as they could of them,
by signs, what nations were this way,
and that way; and were told of several
fierce and terrible people that lived
almost every way, who, as they made
known by signs "to them, used to eat
men; but as for themselves, they said*
they never eat men or women, except
only such as they took in the wars;
and then, they owned, they made a
great feast, and ate their prisoners.
 , The1 Englishmen inquired when they
had had a feast of that kind; and they
told them about two moons ago, point-
ing to the moon, and to'two fingers;
and that their great king had two hun-
 dred prisoners now, which he had taken
in,his war, and they were feeding them
to make them fat for the next feast.
'The/Englishmen seemed mighty desi-
rous of seeing those prisoners$ but the
others mistaking them* thought they
< were desirous to have some of them to
,, carry away for their own*eating; so
they beckoned to them, pointing to the
setting of the sun, and then to the
.rising j which was to signify, that the
.next morning-at sim*iising they would
-'bring some for. them; and, accord-.
Agiy, the next morning*, they brought
down.ive women.and .eleven-men,, and
..-gave them to-the Englishmen,,to carry -
>^ith jtbem.:-on their 'voyagvjust as we -
would bring so many cow* < and: oxen
down to a sea-port town to victual a
ship.
As brutish and barbarous as these
fellows were at home, their stomachs
turned at this sight* and they did not
know what to do. • To refuse the.pri-
soners would have been the highest
affront to the savage gentry that could
be offered them, and what to do with
them they knew not. However, after
some debate, they resolved to accept of
them; and, in return, they gave the
savages that brought them one of their
hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six
or seven of their bullets; which, though
they did not understand their use, they
seemed particularly pleased with; and
then tying the poor creatures' hands
behind them, they dragged the pri-
soners into the boat for our men.
The Englishmen were obliged to
come away as soon as they had them,
or else they that gave them this  noble
present would certainly have expected
that they-, should have gone to work
with them, have killed two or three of
them the next morning, and perhaps
have invited the donors to dinner. But
having taken their leave, with all the
respect and thanks that'could well pass
between people, where, on either side,
they understood not one word- they
could say, they put off with tbeir.jboat,
and came back towards the first island;
where, when they arrived, they set eight
of their prisoners at liberty, there being
too many of them for their occasion.
In their voyage, they endeavoured to
have some communication with - their
prisoners; but it was impossible to
make them understand any thing; .no-
thing they could say to them* or give
them, or do for them, but was looked
upon as going to murder them. They
irst of all unbound them, but the
poor creatures screamed at that, espe-
cially the women, as if they had just
felt the knife at their throats y for.they
immediately concluded they were un-
bound on purpose to be killed. If
they gave them any thing to eat, it was
the same thing; they then concluded,
il was for fear they should sink in
flesh, and so not be fat enough to kill.
If they looked, at one' orVthem. rftiore

eluded. If was to see whether tie or she
was fattest, and fittest to kill first:
nay, after they had brought them quite
over, and began to use them kindly,
and treat them well, still they expected
every day to make a dinner or supper
for their new masters.
When the three wanderers had given
this unaccountable history or journal
of their voyage, the Spaniard asked
them where "their new family was; and
being told that they had brought them
on .shore, and put them into one of
their huts, and were come up to beg
some victuals for them, they (the Spa-
niards) and the other two Englishmen,
that is to say, the whole colony, re-
solved to go all down to the place and
see them; and did so, and Friday's
father with them.
When they came into the hut, there
they sat all bound; for when they had
brought them on shore, they bound
thcir^hands, that they might not take
the boat and make their escape; there,
I say, they sat, all of them stark naked.
First, there were three men, lusty,
comely fellows, well-shaped, straight
tod fair limbs, about thirty to thirty-
five years of age; and fire women,
whereof two might be from thirty to
forty j two more not above four or live
and twenty; and the fifth, a tall comely
maiden, about sixteen or seventeen.
The women were well favoured, agree-
able persons, both in shape and' fea-
tures, only tawny; and two of them,
had they*been perfect white, would
have passed for very handsome women,
even in London Itself, having pleasant
agreeable countenances, and of a very
moftest behaviou'r; especially when they
came afterwards to be clothed and
dressed, as they called it, though that
dress was very indifferent, it must be
confessed; of'which hereafter.
The sight, you may lie sure, was
something uncouth to our Spaniards,
who were, to give them a just charac*
ter, men of the best behaviour, of the
tnoitealni, sedate tempers, and* per-
fect ' 'good-humour, that ever I met
with'j 'and, in particular* of the most
modesty, "as will presently appear:
1 say, the sight was* very uncouth, to
 see three naked men tad five naked
 woiieif, mil together bound, and m
the most miserable cfrcutnstaneGB that
human nature could be supposed to
be, viz, to be expecting every moment
to be dragged out, and have their
brains knocked out, and then to be
eaten up like a calf that is killed for a
dainty.
The first thing they did was to cause
the old Indian, Friday's father, to go
in, and see, first, if he knew any of
them, and then if he understood" any
of their speech. As soon as the old
man came in, he looked seriously at
them, but knew none of them; nei-
ther could any of them understand
a word lie said, or a sign he could
make, except one of the women*
However, this was enough to answer
the end, which was to satisfy them that
the men into whose hands they were fal-
len were Christians; that they abhorred
eating men or women; and they might
be sure they would not be killed.' As
soon an they were assured of this,
they discovered such a joy, and by
such awkward gestures, several ways,
m is hard to describe; for, it seems,
they were of several nations.
The woman who was their interpre-
ter was hid, in the next place, to ask
them if they were willing to be ser-
vants, and' to work for the men who
had brought them away, to save their
lives; at which they all fell a'dancing;
and presently one fell to taking up
this, and another that, any thing that
lay next, to carry on their shoulders,
to intimate that they were willing to
work.
The governor, who found that the
having women among them would
be presently attended with some in-
convenience, and might occasion some
strife, and perhaps 'blood, asked! "the
three men what they intended to 4o
with these women, and how they in-
tended to use them, whether as' ser-
vants Or as women? One of the
. Englishmen answered very boldly 'and
readily, that they would use them as
both;* to which the governor said,
1 am not going to restrain yon from it;
you are your owtt masters as to that;  but
this I think is bat just, for avoiding
disorders and quarrels among  you,
• and 1 desire it 'Of you for that'reason
only, viz* .That' yon will all -engage.

thai if any of you tak.e .any of these
wqihcji, as a woman or wife, that lie
shall take but one: and that having
taken one, none else show lei touch her;
for 'though we cannot marry any one
of you, yet it is but reasonable that
while you stay here, the woman any
of you takes should be maintained by
the" man that takes her, and should be
his wife; 1 mean, says he, while he
continues here,, and that none else
shall have any thing to do with her.
All' this appeared so just, that every
one,agreed to It without any difficulty.
Then the Englishman asked the
Spaniards if they designed to take any
of them? But every one of them, an-
swered no; some of them said they
had. wives in Spain, and the others
did not like women that were not-
Christians: and all tog-ether declared'
that they would not touch one of
them; which was an instance of such
virtue as I have not met with in all
mf travels. On the other hand, to
he ' short,' the five. Englishmen took
them every one a wife, that is to say,
a temporary wife; and so they set up
anew form of living, for the Spani-
ards and Friday's father lived in iny
old. habitation, which they had enlar-
ged exceedingly within. The three
servants which were taken in the late
battle of the savages lived with them;
and these carried on.the main part of
the;colon?,, supplied all the rest with
food,( i ana* assisted them in any thing'
as tliey could, or as. they .found neces-
sity Required.
But the wonder; of this story was,
how, five speh refractory, ill-matched
fellows,,, should agree about these wo-
men,, and that two of them should not
pitch',: upon the same woman, especi-
ally seemg.two'or three of them were,.
without., comparison, more agreeable
thai*'t;ne'. others; but they took, a good
way enough tp prevent .quarrelling
among,; themselves; for the? set the
five womea by themselves m one of
their'huts, and they went, all into the
other hujt, and drew lots among., them*
who should choose, first..
He tnat drew .to, choose-first, went
away' by himself to,the hpt where, the,
poor'iaake% creatures were, and-fetch*?.-
ed- cMt herhe chose $,,and it/was worth,
 
observing, that, lie that chose , first
took her that was reckoned. the .homi-
lies t and oldest of the five, which made
mirth enough among the rest; and
even the Spaniards laughed at it:1' but
. the fellow considered better than any
of them, that it was application and
business they were to expect assis-
tance in, as much as in any thing else-j
and she proved the best wife of all'
the parcel.
When the poor women saw them-
selves set in a row thus, and fetched
out one by one, the terrors of their
condition returned upon them again,
and they firmly believed they were
now going to be devoured. Accord*
ingly, when the English sailor came,
in and fetched out one' of thetn, the
rest set up a most lamentable cry,
and hung about her, and took their
leave of her with such agonies and
affection, as would have grieved the
hardest heart in the world ; nor was it
possible for the Englishmen to satisfy 
them that they were not to be inline*-
diately murdered, till they fetched
the old man Friday's father, who im-
mediately let them know that the
five men, who had fetched them out
one by one, had chosen them for their
wives.
When they had done, and the, fright
the women were in was a little over,
the men went to work, and' the Spani-
ards came and .helped' them 5 and in >
a few hours they had built, them every
one a new hut or tent for their lodging;
apart; for those they had already
were crowded with their tools, house-
hold stuff, and provisions. The three
wicked ones had pitched farthest- of, .
and the two honest ones nearer, but
both on the north shore of the island*
so that they continued separated m be*-

In three places; and, as 1. might; say,.
three towns were begun to be built':
And here it was ,very well,.-worth 
observing, that, as it often 'hapnensin
the world (what the wise ends of God's
providence are in-. such ,a disposition of
things, I cannot say), the two honest
fellows tod the . two worst wives-;

temper or humour, for nil the five

than wives; but my meaning* is, they

Another observation 1 must make.
to the honour of a diligent applica-
tion, on one hand, awl to the disgrace
of a slothful, negligent, idle temper,
on tie other, that when I came to the
place, and viewed the several improve-
ments, planting's, and management
of the several little colonies, the two
men had so far out-gone the three,
that'.there was no comparison. They
had, indeed, both of them as much
ground laid out for corn as they want-
ed; the reason was, because, accord-
ing to my rule, nature dictated that it
was to no purpose to sow more corn
than they wanted; but the difference
of the cultivation, of the planting* of
the fences, and, indeed, of every thing
else, was easy to be seen at first
view*
The two men had innumerable young
trees planted about their huts, so that
when you came to the place, nothing
was. to be seen but a wood: and
though they had twice had their plan-
tation demolished, once by their own
countrymen, and once by the enemy,
as shall be shown in its place, yet
they had restored all again, and every
thing'-was thriving and flourishing
about them j they had grapes planted
in order, Mid managed like a vine-
yard, - though they had themselves
never-seen any thing of that kind; and
by their good ordering their vines,
their grapes'were as good again as any
of the others. 'They bad also found
themselves out a retreat In the thick-
est part, of the woods \ where, though
there, was not a natural cave, as 1 'had
found,- .yet they made one with inces-
sant labour of their hands, and where,
when the mischief' which followed
happened*'they~'secured their wives
and 'children, so' as they could never
be found; "they.' nfeving, *%f sticking
innumerable staktis and poles of tie
wood which', as I said, grew,so readily,
made the grove impassable, except in
some places where the? climbed up
to get over the outside part, and
then went on by ways of their own
leaving.
As to the three reprobates, as 1
justly call them, though they were
much civilized by their settlement
compared to what they were before,
and' were not so quarrelsome, not
having the same opportunity; yet one
of the certain companions of n profli-
gate mind never left them, and that ,
was their idleness. It h true, they
planted corn, and made fences; hut
Solomon's words were never better
verified than in them, *'I went by the
vineyard of tin* slothful, and it was
all overgrown with thorns;" for when
the Spaniards came to view tlit-.it* crop,
they could not see it in some places
for weeds, the hedge had several' gaps
in it, where the wild goats had got in
and eaten up the corn; perhaps here
and there a dead bush wag crammed
in, to stop them out for the present,
but it was only shutting the stable-
door after the steed was srolco; where-
as, when they looked on the colony
of the other two, there was the very
face of industry aid success upon all
they did; there was not a weed to be
seen in all their corn, or a gap in any
of their hedges; and they, on the other
hand, verified Solomon's words in ano-
ther place, **that the diligent hand
inaketh rich ;" for every thing graur
and thrived,-tod they had plenty with-
in and without they had mor^ tame
cattle than the others, more uieasib
and accessaries within doors, and
yet more pleasure and diversion too,
Jr is true, the wives of the three'
were very handy and cleanly within
doors, and having learned the English
ways of dressing and cooking from
one of the other Englishmen, who,
-as I' have said, was a cook*s-i»»tc
on board the ship, they dressed
their husbands' victual very aictty
*and well; whereas the others' couliEi
not be brought to understand if;"'but
then the'husoaiid, who, mt$mf had
been cook's*mate, did it himself. 'But
as for the husbands of the three wives,

egp» and' caught §sh and'binds ^in a
wmif any thing but labour, and they
itfed accordingly. The diligent lived
well and comfortably j and the slothful
lived hard ' and  beggarly 5 and s% I
believe; generally speaking, it is all
over the world.
"But Tnow come to' a scene differ-
ent from'all thai had happened before,
either to them or me; and the origi-
nal of the 'story was this: Early one
morning, there came on shore five or
sIjc canoes of Indians 'or savages, call
them -which you please, and there is
iid' romn to doubt they came upon the
old errand of feeding'upon their slaves;
but that part was now so familiar to
the Spaniards, and to our men too,
that they did' not concern themselves
about it, as 1 did: but having been
made sensible, bv their experience,
that their only business was to lie
conceded, and that if they were not
.aeen by any of the savages, they
would go off again qtiie.lv, when their
business was done, hiving, as yet,
not the least notion of there being any
inhabitants in the island; 1 say, having
been mode sensible of this, they had
nothing to do bit to give notice to
all the three plantations to keep with-
in, doors? and not to show them-
selves,  only placing a scout in
a proper place, to give notice
when' the boats went to sea a^ain.
This'was without'doubt very right;
but a disaster spoiled all these raea-
euttes* and' made it known amomj the
ravages that there were inhabitants
there 5; which was in' the end the deso-
lation of 'almost the whole colony.
After the canoes  with the' savages
wire gone  off, the Spaniards peeped
abroad again; and some of them1 had
the eurosit? to go to the place where
they had been, to see what they had
been doing.  Here, to their great sur-
prliej they found three savages left
behindhand lyiog fast asleep upon the
ground.  It -was' supposed they^ had
either been so gorged with their inhu-
man feast, that, like beasts, they were
fallen' asleep, - and would not stir- when
the others went, or they had wander-
ed' into the woods* and  did not come
lack in time *o :be taken in, 
The Spaniards were greatly surpri-
sed at this sights and perfectly at' »
lots what to do. The Spanish gover-
nor, m it happened, was- with them,
and his advice was asked, but |he pro-
fessed he knew 'iiot what to do. As
for slaves, they had enough already -f
and as to killing them, they were
none of them inclined to that; the
Spaniard governor told me, they could
not think of shedding innocent blood:
for as to them, the poor creatures had
done them no wrong, invaded-none
of their property, and they' thought
they had no just quarrel against them,
to take away their lives. And here
I must, in justice to these Spaniards,
observe, that let the accounts of
Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru
be what they will, I never met with
seventeen men of any nation what-
soever, in any foreign country, who
were so universally modest, temper-
ate, virtuous, so very good-humoured,
and so courteous, as these Spaniards;
and as to cruelty, they had nothing
of it in their very nature; no inhu-
manity, no barbarity, no outrageous
passions; and yet all of them men of
great courage and spirit. Their
temper and calmness had appeared in
their bearing the insufferable usage
of the three Englishmen; and their
justice and humanity appeared now
in the case of the sa¥ages, as above.
After some consultation, they resol-
ved upon this; that they would lie
still a while longer, till, if possible,
these three men might be gone. But
then the governor Spaniard recol-
lected, that the three savages had no
boat;" and'if they were left to rove
about the island, they would certainly
discover that there were inhabitants
in it; and so they should' be undone
that way. Upon' this they went back
again, and there lay the fellows fait
asleep still, and so they- resolved to
waken them, and take them priso-
ners; and they did so. The poor
fellows were strangely frightened
when they were seized upon and
bound; and afraid like the women,
that they should be murdered and
eaten: for it seems thosfe' 'people
think all the world does as' they 'dd,
eat mea*s lesh $ -but they -were soon
m-i
 
male-easy as to that,, and away.they
carried the®;
It was very happy for them that
they did not carry them home to
theur castle, 1 .mean to my palace
under .the hill; but they carried them
first to the bower, where was the chief
of their, country workt such as the
keeping the goats, the plan ting the
coru/acc*; aiid afterwards they carried
them to the habitation of the two
Itaglfehmen.
Were they were set to work, though
it was not much they had for them to
do; and .whether it was by neg-
ligence in guarding them, or that
they thought the fellows could not
mend themselves, 1 know not, hut
one of them ran away, and taking to
the woods, they could never hear of
him any more.
They had good reason to helieve
he .got home again soon after, in some
other boats or canoes of savages who
came on shore three or four weeks
afterwards; and who carrying on
their revels as usual, went off in two
days time. This thought terrified
them exceedingly; for they concluded
and -that not without good cause in-
deed, that if this fellow came home
safe among his comrades, he would
certainly give them an account 4hat
there were people in the island, and
also how few and weak they were;
for thij savage, as I observed before,
had never been told, and it was very
happy he had not, how many there
were, or.where they lived j nor had he
met seen or heard the ire of any of
their guns, much .less had they shown
him any* of their other retired places;
such/ as the cave in the valley, or the
new retreat which the two English-
men had made, and the like.
.; The first testimony. they had that
'this fellow had given intelligence of
them .was, that about two months after
this, .six canoeb of safages, with about
aeven, eight, or ten men in a canoe,
came ..rowing along the north side of
the i$land» where they never used to
come ,, before,, and  landed, about an
hour: after sun-rfee, at. a convenient
pbcc-abo.uta mile from the habita-
tion of .the two English men, where

men to fifty was too much,odd**.:' The
two men had the happinesa. to discover
them about a league off# so that k-wak
above an hour before they landed:. and
as they landed,a mile from their huta,
it was some time before they could
come at them. Now, having great
reason to^ believe that they were ..be*
tray eel, the first thing they, aid was to
bind the two slaves" which were left^
and cause two of the three men whom 
they brought with the women.(who*
It seems, proved very faithful to
them) to lead them, with their. two
wives, and whatever they could carry-
away with them, to their retired places
in the woods, which 1 have spoken of
above, and there to bind the tw#
fellows hand and foot, till they heard,
farther.
In the next place seeing the sa-
vages were all come on shore, and
that they had bent their course di-
rectly that way, they opened the
fences where the milch goats were
kept, and drove them all out; leaving
their goats to straggle in the woods,
whither they pleased, that the lavage*
might think they .were all bred wild;
but the rogue who came with them was
too cunning for that, and gave them
an account of it all, for they went di-
rect!? to the place. , , ,..
when the two poor frightened men
had secured their -wives .and goods,
they sent the other slave they had of
the three who came with the, women*
and who was at their place -by. ac-
cident, away to the Spaniards with aH
speed, to give them the alarm, and
desire speedy help; and, in the mean
time, they took their arms, and what
ammunition they had, and retreated
towards the place in the wood where
their wives were sentj, beeping at m
distance, yet so. that they might see,
if possible, which way the savages
took, , . , - ...
They had not gone far, but that
from a rising ground they could, aee
the- little army of their enemies mw
on directly to thea habitation, and, .#

making a different noise, according
to their kind ; just as it wa» when I
fired the first gun that perhaps wm
ever shot off in the island.
However, all being silent again, and
they not knowing what the matter was,
came on unconcerned, till they came
to the place where their companions
lay, in a condition miserable enough;
and here the poor ignorant creatures,
not sensible that they were within
reach of the same mischief, stood all
of a huddle over the wounded man,
talking, and, m may be supposed, in-
quiring of him how he came to he
hurt; and who, it is very rational to

Our two men, though, m they con-
fessed to me, it grieved them to he
obliged to kill so many poor creature*,
who, at the same time, had no notion
of their danger; yet, having them all
thus in their power, and the first hav-
ing loaded his' piece again, resolved to

singling out, * hy agreement, which to

or very much wounded, four of them;
the fifth, frightened even to death,
though not hurt, fell with the rest; so
that our men seeing them all foil to-
gether, thought thev had killed them
all.
The Indict that the savages svere. all

place, and fount! no less than four of
them alive, and of them two very little

them to fall upon them with the stocks
of their muskets; and first they made
sure of the runaway savage, that had
been the cause of all the mischief, and
of another that was hurt in the knee,
and put them out of their pain; then
the man that was not hurt at all came
and kneeled down to them, with hU

moans to them, by gestures and signs,
for his life, but could not say one
word to them that they could under-
stand. However, they made signs to
him to sit down at the foot of a tree
hard by; and one of theEnglishmen,
with a piece of rope twined, which he
had by great chance in his pocket,
tied his two hands behind him, and
there they left him: and with what
speed they could made after the other
two, which were gone before, fearing
they, or any more of them, should
find the way to their covered place in
the woods, where their wives, and the
few goods they had left, lay. They
came once in sight of the two men, but
it was at a great distance; however, they
had the satisfaction to see them cross
over a valley towards the sea, quite the
contrary way from that which led to their
retreat, which they were afraid of;
and being satisfied with that, they went
back to the tree where they left their
prisoner, who, as they supposed, was
delivered by his comrades, for he was
gone, anil the two pieces of rope-
yarn, with which they had hound him,
Jay just at the foot of the tree.
They were now in as great concern
as before, not knowing what course to
take, or how near the enemy might be,
or in what numbers; so they resolved
to go away to the place where their
wives were* to see if all was well there,
and to make them easy, who were in
fright enough to be sure; for though
the savages were their own country-
folk, yet they were most terribly
afraid' of them, and perhaps the
more for the knowledge they had of
them.
When they came there, they found
the ravages had been in the wood,
and very near that place, but had not
found it v for it was indeed inaccessible,
by the trees standing so thick, as be-
fore, unless the persons seeking it had
been directed by those that knew it,
which these did not: they found,
therefore, every thing very safe, only
the women in a terrible fright. While
they were her«e, they had the comfort
to have seven of the Spaniards come to
their assistance; the other ten, with
their servants, and old Friday, I mean
Friday's father, were gone in a body to
defend their bower, and the corn and
cattle that was kept there, in case the
savages should have rowed over to
that side of the country; but they did
not spread so for. With the seven
Spaniards came one of the three sa-
vages who, as I said, were their pri-
soners formerly: and with them also
came the savage whom the English-
men had left bound hand and foot at
the tree; for it seems, they came that
way, saw the slaughter of the seven
men, and unbound the eighth,' and
brought him along with them; where,
however, they were obliged to bind
him again, as they had the two others
who were left when the third ran
away.
The prisoners now began to he a
burthen to them; and they were so
afraid of their escaping, that they were
once resolving to kill them all, be-
lieving they were under an absolute
necessity to do so, for their own pre-
servation. However, the Spaniard
governor would not consent to it; but
ordered, for the present, that they
should be sent out of the way, to my
old cave in the valley, and "be kept
there, with two Spaniards to guard
them; and give them food for their
subsistence, which was done; and
they were bound there hand and foot
for that night
When the Spaniards came, the two
Englishmen were so encouraged, that
they could not satisfy themselves to
stay any longer there;* but taking five
of the Spaniards and themselves, with
four muskets and a pistol among them,
and two stout quarter-staves, away
they went in quest of the savages.
And first they came to the tree where
the men lay that had been killed; but
it was easy to see that some more of
 
195
 
the savages had been there, fur they
had attempted to carry their dead
meu away, and had dragged two of
them a good way, but had given it
i#?er. , From thence they advanced
to the first rising ground, where
they had stood aoa seen their camp
destroyed, and where they had the
mortification still to see some of the
smoke: but neither could they here
see any of the savages. They then
resolved, though with all possible
caution, to go forward, towards their
ruined plantation; but a little before
they came thither, coming in sight
of the set-shore, they saw plainly
the savages all embarked again in their
canoe*, in order to begone. They
seemed sorry, at first, that there
was no way to come at them, to gi?e
them a. parting blow; but upon the
whole, they were very well satisled
to be rid of them.
The poor Englishmen being now
twice ruinted, and all their improve-
ments destroyed, the rest all agreed
to come and help them to rebuild,
and to assist them with needful
supplies. Their three countrymen,
who were not yet noted for having
the least inclination to do any good,
yet as soon as they heard of it (for
they living , remote eastward, knew
nothing of the matter till ail was
over), came and offered their help and
assistance, and did, • very friendly,
work for several days, to restore their
habitation, and make necessaries for
them. And thus, in a little time,
they were set upon their legs again.
About two, days after this, they
had the farther , satisfaction of seeing
three of the savages* canoes come
driving on shore, and at some dis-
tance from them, two drowned men:
by which they had reas#n to believe
that, they had met with a storm at
seat which had overset some tof them;
for it had blown very hard the night
after they-.went off. . .
However, m some might miscarry,
so, on the other hand, enough of
them .escaped to inform the rest, as
well of what they had done as of what
had happened to them, and to whet
them on to another enterprise of the
same nature; which they, it seems.
resolved to attempt, with sufficient
force . to carry all before them: for
except what the first man had told
them of inhabitants, they could , say-
little of it of their own knowledge,
for they never saw one man; and the
fellow being killed that had affirmed
it, they had no other witness to con-
firm it to them.
It was five or six months after this
before they heard any more of the
savages, in which time our men were
in hopes they had either forgot their
former bad luck, or given over hopes
of better; when, on a sudden, the
were invaded with a most formidable
fieet of no less than eight-and-tweUty
canoes, full of savages, armed with
bows and arrows, |reat clubs, wooden
swords, and such-like engines of war;
and they brought such numbers with
them, that, in short, it put all our
people into the utmost consternation.
As they came on shore in the eve-
ning, and at the easternmost side of
the island, our men had that night
to consult and consider what to 3o;
and, in the first place, knowing that
their being entirely concealea was
their only safety before, and would
be much more so now, while the
the number of their enemies was so
great, they therefore resolved, first
of all, to take down the huts which
were built for the two Englishmen, and
drive away their goats to the old
cave; because they supposed the
savages would go directly thither,
as soon as it was day, to play the old
game over again, though they did
not now land within two leagues of
it. In the next place, they drove
away all the flocks of goats rtiey had
at tiit old bower, as I called It, which
belonged to the# Spaniards, and, In
short, left as little appearance of
inhabitants any where as was possible;
and the next morning early they post-
ed themselves, with all their force, at
the plantation of the two men, to
wait for their coming. As they gnes-
sed, so it happened; these new inva-
ders leaving tneir canoes at the east end
of the island, came ranging along the
shore, directly towards the place, to
the number of two hundred and filly,
as near as our men could judge. Our
 
o2
ADVENTURES OF
 
 
army was but small, indeed; but that
which was worse they had not arms
for all their number neither. The
whole account, it .seems, stood thus:
first, as to men, seventeen Spaniards,
five Englishmen, old Friday, or Fri-
day's father, the three slaves taken
with the worn en, who proved very
faithful, and three other slaves, who
lived with the Spaniards, To arm
the.se, they had eleven muskets,
five pistols, three fowling-piece*,
five muskets or fowling-pieces which
were taken by me from the mutinous
seamen whom 1 reduced, two swords,
and three old halberds.
To their slaves they did notgivft either
musket or fusee, but they had every one
a halberd, or long staff, "like a quarter-
staff, with a great spike of iron fasten-
ed into each end of it, and by his side
a hatchet; also every one of our men
had a hatchet. Two of the women
could not be prevailed upon but they
would come into the fight, and they
had bows and a/rows?, which the Spa-
niards had taken from the savages
when the first action happened, which
I have spoken of, where the Indians
fought with one another; and the
women had hatchets too.
The Spaniard governor, whom I
described so often, commanded the
whole: and Will Atkins, who, though
a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was
a motft daring, bold fellow, command-
ed under him. The savages came
forward like lions; and our men, which
was the worst of their fate, had no
advantage in their situation; only
that Will Atkins, who now proved a
most useful fellow, with six men, was
planted just behind a small thicket of
bushes, as an advanced guard, with
orders to let the first of them pass by,
and then fire into the middle of them,
and as soon as he had fired to make
his retreat as nimble as he could round
a part ofthe wood, and so come in
- behind the Spaniards where they stood,
having a thicket of trees before them.
When the savages came on, they
ran straggling about every way in
heaps, out of ail manner of order, and
Will Atkins let about fifty of them
pass by him;- then seeing the rest
come in a very thick throng, he orders
three of his men to fire, hanng loaded
their muskets with six or seven bul-
lets apiece, about m big as large
pistol-bullets. How many they "kil-
led or wounded they knew not, but
the consternation and surprise was
inexpressible among the savages; they
were frightened to the last degree to
hear such a dreadful noise, and see
their men killed, and others hurt,
but see nobody that did it; when in
the middle of their fright, Will Atkins
and his other three let fly again
among the thickest of them; and in
less than a minute the first three
being loaded again, gave them a third
volley.
Hail Will Atkins and his men reti-
red immediately, as soon as they had
fired as they were ordered to do, or
had the rest of the body been at hand,
to have poured in their shot conti-
nually, the savages had been effectu-
ally routed; for the terror that was
among them came principally from
this, "viz, that they were killed by
the gods with thunder and lightning,
and could see nobody that hurt them;
but Will Atkins, staying to load again,
discovered the cheat; some of the
savages who were at a distance spy-
ing them, came upon them behind;
and though Atkins and his men fired
at them also, two or three times, and
killed above twenty, retiring as fast
as they could, yet they wounded
Atkins himself, and killed one of his
fellow Englishmen with their arrows,
as they did afterwards one Spaniard,
and one of the Indian slaves who
came with the women. This slave
was a most gallant fellow, and fought
most desperately, killing five of them
with his own hand, having no weapon
but one of the armed staves and a
hatchet.
Our men being thus hard laid at,
Atkins wounded, and two other men
killed, retreated to a rising ground
in the wood, ami the Spaniards, after
firing three volleys upon them, retrea
ted "alsojfor their number was so
great, and they were so desperate, that
though above 'fifty of them were kil-
led, and more than as many wound-
ed, yet they came on in the" teeth of
our men, fearless of danger, and
 
 
 
197
ahot their arrows like a cloud j and
it was observed that their wounded
pen, who were not quite disabled
were made outrageous by their
wounds, and fought like madmen.
When our men retreated, they left
the Spaniard and the Englishman
that were killed behind them; and
the savages, when they came up to
them, killed them over again In a
wretched manner, breaking their arms,
legs, and heads* with their clubs and
wooden swords, like true savages j but
inding our men were gone, they did
wot seem to pursue {hem, but drew
themselves up in a ring, which is, it
seems, their custom, and shouted
twice, in token of their victory; after
which,, they bad the mortification to
see several of their wounded men fail,
dying with the mere loss of blood.
The Spaniard governor having
drawn his little body up together
upon a rising ground, Atkins, though
he. .wan wounded, would have had
them march and charge again alto-
gether at once: but the Spaniard re-
plied, Seignior Atkins, you see how
their wounded men fight; let them
alone 'till morning; all the wounded
men will be stiff and sore with their
wounds* and faint with the loss of
blood; and so we shall have the fewer
to engage. This advice was good;
but Will Atkins replied merrily. That
ist true,, seignior, and so shall 1 tooj
and that is the reason I would go on
while I am warm.—Well, seignior
:.Atkins, "says the Spaniard, you have
behaved gallantly, and, done your
fart; we wilt 'fight for vou, if, you
cannot .come on; but I think it best
to .stay till morning: so they waited.
, But as it was a clear moon-light
i night, and they found the savages in
great disorder about their dead and
.wounded men, and a great noise and
hurry among them were they lay, they
afterwards resolved to fall upon them
iii the night; especially if they could
come to give. them but one volley be-
fore they were discovered, which they
.had a lair opportunity to do; for one
of the Englishmen,*in whose quarter
• it was were the fight began, led them
found between the woods and the
j^a-sidi westward and then .turning
short south, they came so near to
where the thickest of them lav, that,
before they were seen or heard, eight
of them ft red in among them, and
did dreadful execution upon them;
in half a minute, more, eight others
fired after them, pouring 'in their
small shot in such a quantity, that
abundance were killed and wounded;
and all this while they were not able
to see who hurt them or which way
to §y.
The Spaniards charged again with
the utmost expedition, and then divi-
ded themselves in three bodies, and
resolved to fall in among them all
together. The? had in each body
eight persons, that is to say, twenty-
two and the two women, who, by the
way, fought desperately. They divi-
ded the ire-arms equally in each party,
and so the halberds and staves. They
would have had the women kept back,
but they said they were resolved to
die with their husbands. Having
thus formed their little army, they
marched out from among the trees,
and carae up to teeth of their enemy,
shouting and holloing as loud as they
could; "the savages .stood all together,
but were in the utmost confusion,
hearing the noise of our men shout-
ing from three quarters together:
they would have fought if they had
seen us j for as soon as we came near
enough to be seen, some arrows were
shot,*"and poor'old Friday was, wound-
ed, though not dangerously 5 but our
men gave them no time, but,
running up to them, fired among
them three ways, and then fell in
with the butt-ends of their muskets,
their swords, armed staves, and hatch-
ets, and laid about them so well,
that, in a word, they set up a ^ dismal
screaming and howling, flying- to
save their lives which way soever they
could.
Our men were tired with the execu-
tion, and killed or mortally wounded
•in .the two fights about one hundred
and eighty of tbe:ro; the rest, being
frightened out of their  wits scoured
through the woods and over the Mils,
with all the speed fear and nimble
feet could help them to y and a* we
did lot trouble ourselves much ,.to

ADVENTURES OF
pursue thcin, they got altogether to
the sea-side where they landed, and
where their canoes lay. But their dis-
aster was not at an end yet; for it
blew a terrible storm of* wind that
evening from the sea, so that it was
Impossible for them to go oif; nay,
the storm continuing all night, when
the tide came up, their canoes were
most of them driven by the surge of
the sea so high upon the shore, that
it required infinite toil to get them
off; and some of them were even
dashed to pieces against the beach,
or against one another.
Our men though glad of their vic-
tory, yet got little rest that night;
but having refreshed themselves as
well as they could, thev resolved to
march to that part of the island
where the savages were fled, and
se* what posture they were in. This
necessarily led them* over the place
where the fight had been, and where
they found several of the poor crea-
tures not quite dead, and yet past
recovering life; a sight disagreeeble
enough to generous minds; for a
truly great man, though obliged by
the law of battle to destroy his ene-
my, takes no delight in his misery,
However, there was no need to give
any orders in this case; for their
own ravages, who were their ser-
vants, dispatched these poor creatures
with their hatchets.
At length they came in view of the
place where the more miserable re-
mains of the savages' army lay, where
there appeared about a hundred still:
their posture was generally sitting
upon the ground, with their knees
up towards their mouth, and the head
put between the two hands, leaning
down upon the knees.
When our men came within two
musket shots of them, the Spaniard
governor ordered two muskets to be fired
without ball, to alarm them; this he did
that by their countenance he might
know what to expect, viz, whether
t »ey were still in heart to fight, or
were so heartily beaten as to be dis-
pirited and discouraged, and so he
might manage accordingly. This stra-
tagem took; for as soon as the sava-
ges heard the first gun and saw the
flash of the second, they started up upon
their feet in the greatest consternation
imaginable: and as our men advanced
swiftly towards thern, they all ran
screaming and yelling away, with a
kind of howling noise, which our men
did not understand, and had never
heard before; and thus they ran up
the hills into the country.
At first our men had much rather
the weather had been calm and they had
all gone away to sea; but they did not
then consider that this might probably
have been the occasion of their com-
ing again in such multitudes as not
to be resisted, or, at least, to come
so many, and so often, as would quite
desolate the island, and starve them.
Will Atkins, therefore, who, notwith-
standing his wound, kept always with
them, proved the best counsellor in
this case: his advice was, to take the
advantage that offered, and clap in
between thern and their boats, and so
deprive them of the capacity of ever
returning any more to plague the
island.
They consulted long about this;
and some were against it, for fear of
making the wretches fly to the woods
and live there desperate, and so thev
should have them to hunt like wild
beasts, be afraid to stir out about
their business, and have their planta-
tion continually rifled, all their tame
goats destroyed, and, in short, be
reduced to a fife of continual distress.
Will Atkins told them they had
better have to do with a hundred
men than with a hundred nations;
that as they must destroy their boats,
so they must destroy the men, or
be all of them destroyed themselves.
In a word, he showed them the
necessity of it so plainly, that they
all came into it; so* they went
to work immediately with the boats,
and getting some dry wood together
from a dead tree they tried to set some
of them on fire, but they were so
wet that they would not burn;
however, the fire so burned the upper
part, that it soon made them unfit
for swimming in the sea as boats.
When the Indians saw what they were
about, some of them came running
out of the woods, and coming as near
199
m they could to our men, kneeled
down and cried, "Oa, CM, Waramokoa,"
Mid some other words of their lan-
guage, which none of the others un-
derstood any thing of; but as they
made pitiful gestures .and strange
• noises, it was easy to understand they
begged'to have their boats spared, and
that they would begone, and never
come there again." But our men
were now satisfied that they had no
way to preserve themselves, or to save
their colony, but effectually to prevent
any of these • people from ever going
home again; depending upon this,
that if even so much as one of them
got  back into their country to tell
the story* the colony was undone; so
that, letting them know that they
should not have any mercy, they fell
to work with their canoes, and destroy-
ed them every. one that the storm had
not destroyed before; at the sight of
which the savages raised a hideous
cry in the woods, which' our people
heard plain enough, after which they
ran about the island like distracted
men ; so that, in a word, our men did
not really know at first what to do
with them. Nor did the Spaniards,
.with all their prudence, consider, that
while they made those people thus des-
perate, the? ought to have kept a
good guard at the same time upon
their plantations: for though it is true
they had driven away their cattle, and
the*Indians did not find'out their main
retreat, 1 mean my old castle at the
hill, nor the cave in the valley, yet
they found out my plantation at the
bower, and pulled it all to pieces,
and all the fences and planting about
it 5 trod all the corn under foot,
tore up the vines and grapes, being
just then almost ripe, and did our men
an inestimable damage, though to
themselves not one farthing's worth of
service.
Though our men were able to
fight them upon all occasions yet they
were in no condition to pursue them;
• or hunt them up and down; for as
they were too nimble of foot for our
men,  when they "found them single,
so 'our • men Jurat not go abroad
tingle, for fear of  being surrounded
-by * tbefr'numbers. The best was,'
they hid no weapons; for though
they had bows, they had no arrows
left, nor any materials-to make any;
nor had they any edged tool or weapon
among them, . • 
The extremity and distress they were
reduced to was great and indeed -de-
plorable; but, at'the same time, our
men were also brought to very'lad
circumstances by-them $ for though
their retreats were preserved, yet
their provision was destroyed, and
their harvest spoiled; and what to1 do,
or which way to turn themselves'they
knew not. The only refuge they
had now was, the stock 'of cattle
they had in the valley by the cave,
and some little corn which grew there,
and the plantation of the three En-
glishmen, Will Atkins and his com-
rades, who were now reduced to two;
one of them being killed by an arrow,
which struck him on the side of his bead
just under the temples, so that he never
spoke more: and it was very remark-
able that this was the same barbarous
fellow that cut the poor savage slave
with his hatchet, and who afterwards in-
tended to have murdered the Spaniards.
I looked upon their case to have
been worse at this time than mine
was at any time, after 1 first discover-
ed the grains of barley and rice, and
got into the manner of planting and
raising my corn, and my tame cattle:
for now they had, as I may say, a
hundred wolves upon the island, which
would devour every thing  they could
come at, yet could be hardily come at
themselves.
When they saw what their circum-
stances were, the first thing they con-
cluded was, that they would if possible,
drive them up to the farther part - of
the island, south-west, that if any
more savages came on shore they
might not find one another: then that
'they would daily hunt and harass them*
ancl kill as many of them as they could
come at, till they had reduced -their
number; and-if they could 'at last
tame' them, and bring them to; any
thing, they 'would give theirt' corn,
and teach them how to plant;'and
live upon their daily labour,' :;"•'
In order to ids, they so •followed

ADVENTURES OP
guns, thai m a few dayn, if any of
them fired a gun at an Indian, if he
did not lilt Sim, yet he would fail
down for fear; and so dreadfully
frightened they were, that they kept
out of sight farther and farther^ till,
at last, our men following them, and
almost every day killing or wounding1
some of them, they kept up in the
woods or hollow places so much, that
it reduced them to the utmost misery
for want of food; and many were
afterwards found dead in the woods,
without any hurt, absolutely starved
to death.
When our men found this, it made
their hearts relent, and pity moved
them, especially the Spaniard gover-
nor, who was the most gentleman-
like, generous-minded man, that I
ever met with in my life; and he pro-
posed, if possible, to take one of them
alive, and bring him to understand
what they meant, so far as to be able
to act as interpreter, and go among
them, and see if they might be
brought to some conditions that might
be depended upon, to save their lives,
and do us no harm.
It was some while before any of
them could be taken; but being weak and
half starved, one of them was at last sur-
prised and made a prisoner. He was
sullen at first, and would neither eat
nor drink; but finding himself kindly
used, and victuals given him, and no
violence offered him, he at last grew
tractable, and came to himself. They
brought old Friday to him, who talk-
ed often with him, and told him how
kind the others would be to them all;
that they would not only save their
lives, but would give them part of
the island to live in, provided they
would give satisfaction that they would
keep in their own bounds, and not
come beyond it to injure or prejudice
others; and that they should have
corn given them to plant and make
it grow for their bread, and some
bread given them for their present
subsistence: and old Friday bade the
fellow go and talk with the rest of
his countrymen, and see what they said
to it; assuring them that if they did
not agree immediately, they should
be alf destroyed.
The poor wretches, thoroughly
humbled, and reduced in number to
about thirty-seven, closed with the
proposal at the first offer, and beg-
ged to have some food given them;
upon which, twelve Spaniards and two
Englishmen, well armed, with three
Indian slaves and old Friday, marched
to the place where they were. The
three Indian slaves carried them a
large quantity of bread, some rice
boiled up to cakes and dried in the
sun, and three live goats; and they
were ordered to go to the side of a hill,
where they sat down, ate their pro-
fisions very thankfully, and were the
most faithful fellows*to their words
that could be thought of; for, except
when they came to beg victuals and
directions, they never came out of
their bounds: and there they lived
when I came to the island, and I went
to see them.
They had taught them both to
plant corn, make bread, breed tame
goats, and milk them: they wanted
nothing but wives, and they soon
would have been a nation. They were
confined to a neck of land, surrounded
with high rocks behind them, and
lying plain towards the sea before
them, on the southeast corner of the
island. They had land enough, and
it was very good and fruitful; about
a mile and a half broad, and three or
four miles in length.
Our men taught them to make
wooden spades, such as I made for
myself, and gave among them twelve
hatchets and three or four knives; and
there they lived, the most subjected
innocent * creatures that ever Were
heard of.
After this, the colony enjoyed a per-
fect tranquillity with respect to the sa-
vages tilt I came to revisit them, which
was about two years alter; not but
that, now and then, some canoes of sa-
vages came on shore for their trium-
phal, unnatural feasts; but as they
were of several nations, and perhaps
had never heard of those that came be-
fore, or the reason of it, they did not
make any search or inquiry after their
countrymen; and if they had, it would
have been very hard to have found
them out.

Thus, I think, I have given a full
account of all that happened to them
till in? return, at least, that'was worth
notice. The Indians or garages were
wonderfully civilised by them, and
they frequently went among them;
hut forbid, on pain of death, any one
of the Indians coming* to them, because
they would not have their settlement
betrayed again. One thing- was very
remarkable, viss. that they taught the
savages to make wicker-work, or bas-
kets, but they soon-outdid their mas-
ters; for they made abundance of moat 
ingenious things in wicker-work, parti-
cularly all sorts of baskets, sieves, bird-*
cages, cupboards, &c.; as also chairs
to sit on, stools, beds, couches, and
abundance of other things; being very
ingenious at «uc*» work, when they
were once put hi the way of it
My corning was a particular relief
to these people, because we furnished
them with Knives, scissars, spades,
shovels, pick-axes, and all things of
that kind which they could want. With
the help of those tools they were so
very handy* that they came at last to
build-up 'their huts, or houses, very
handsomely, raddling or working it up
like basket-work all -the way round;
which was a very extraordinary piece
of ingenuity, and looked very odd, but
was an exceeding good fence, M well
against heat as against all sorts of ver-
min; and our men were so taken with
it, that'they got the 'wild savages to
come and do the like for them \ so that
when I came to see the two English-
men's colonies, they looked, at a dis-
tance, as if they all lived like bees in a
hive. As for- Will Atkins, who was
now become a very industrious, useful,
and sober fellow, he had made himself
such a tent of basket-work, as, I be-
lieve, was never seen; it was one hun-
dred and twenty paces round on the
outside, as I measured by my steps;
the walls were as close worked as a
basket,-in pannels or squares of thir«y-
two in number, and very strong, stand-
ing about seven feet high; in the mid-
dle was another not above twenty-two
paces round,bttt built strot)ger,being oc-
tagon in its form, and in the eight cor-
ners stood elf lit very strong posts; round
the top of wjiich he laid strong pieces,
pinned together'with wooden; pirn,
from which he raised a py'rajnid' for a
roof of eight rafters, very hahdstmieV I
assure you, and joined together, very
well, though lie had no nails, ami only'
a few iron spikes, which he made him-
self too, out of the old Iron that!had;"
left there; and, indeed, this fellow"
showed abundance of ingenuity in sevc-?
nil things which he had no knowledge
of: he made him a forge, with a pair"
of wooden bellows to blow the lire; he
made himself charcoal for his work j
and lie formed out of the iron crows, a
middling good anvil to hammer upon: in .
this maimer he made many things, but'
especially hooks, staples and spikes,
bolts and hinges.—But, to rctnrn to
the house: Alter he had pitched the
roof of his innermost tent, he worked
it up between the rafters with basket-
work, so firm, and thatched that over'
again so ingeniously with rice-straw,
and over that a large leaf of a tree,
which covered the top, that his house
was as dry as if It had been tiled of
slated. Indeed, he owned that the sa-'.
vages had made the basket-work for'
him. The outer circuit was covered _ as
a lean-to, ail round this inner apart-
ment, and long rafters. lay from the;'"
thirty-two angles to the top posts of
the inner house, being about twenty'
feet distant; 'go that there was a space-
like a walk within the outer wicker-'
wall and' without the inner# near twenty;
feet wide. ^ \ ^
The inner place he partitioned off,
with the same wicker-work, but much;
fairer, and divided into six apartment!^;'
so that he had six rooms oa a floor, and
out of every One of these there was a
door; first' into the entry, or coming
into the main tent, another, door into,,
the main tent, and another door into
the space or waBc that was round'it;
so that walk was also divided into six'
equal parts, which served not only £mi
a retreat, but to store up any necessa-
ries which the family had occasion-for,',
These six spices not taking up tlje^
whole circumference, what other apart-
ments the outer circle had were thus
ordered:—As soon as you were- in,at,
the door of the outer circle, you had a"
short passage -straight before you. .1$}
the door of the inner houses'but da'
ADVENTURES OF
witter side was a wicker partition, and
a door in it, by which you went first
into a large room, or storehouse,
twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet
lonif, and through that into another,
not quite so long; so that in the outer
circle were ten 'handsome rooms, six
of widen, were only to be come at
through the apartments of the inner
tent, and served m closets or retiring
rooms to the respective chambers of
the inner circle; and four large ware-
houses, or barns, or what you please to
call them, which went through one an-
other, two on either hand of the pas-
sage, that led through the outer door
to the inner tent.
Such a piece of basket-work, I be-
lieve, was never seen in the world, nor
a house or tent so neatly contrived,
much less so built. In this great bee-
hive lived the thice families, that is to
say. Will Atkins and his companion;
the third was killed, but his wife re-
mained, with three children, for she
was, it seems, big with child when he
died: and the other two were not at all
backward to give the widow her full
share of every thing, I mean as to their
com, milk, grapes",'&e. and when they
killed a kid, or found a turtle on the
shore; so that they all lived well
enough; though, it was true, they were
not so industrious as the other two, as
has been observed already.
One thing, however, cannot be omit-
ted, viz. that as for religion, I do not
know that there was any thing of that
kind among them *, they often, indeed,
put one another in mind that there was
a God, by the very common method of
seamen, viz. swearing by his name:
nor were their poor ignorant savage
wives much better for having been
married to Christians, as we must call
them; for as they knew very little of
God themselves, "so they were utterly
incapable of entering into any dis-
course with their wives about a God,
or to talk any thing to them concerning
religion,
The utmost of all the improvements
which I can say the wives had made
from them was, that they had taught
them to speak English pretty well; and
most of their children, which were near
twenty in all, were taught to speak
English too, from their first learning
to speak, though they at first spoke it
in a very broken manner, like their
mothers. There was none of these
children above nix years old when 1
came thither, for it was not much above
seven years that they had fetched the.*e
five savage ladies over; but they had all
been pretty fruitful, for they had all
children, more or less; I think the cook's
mate's wife was big of her sixth child,and
the mothers were all a good sort of well-
governed, quiet, laborious women, mo-
dest and decent, helpful to one another,
mighty observant and subject to their
masters (J cannot call them husbands),
and wanted nothing but to be well in-
structed in the Christian religion, and
to be legally married; both which
were happily brought about afterwards
by my means, or, at least, in conse-
quence of coming among them.
Having thus given an account of the
colony in general, and pretty much of
my runagate English, I. must say some-
thing of the Spaniards, who were the
main body of the family, and in whose
story there are some incidents also re-
markable enough..
I had a great many discourses with
them about their circumstances when
they were among the savages, They
told me readily that they had no in-
stances to give of their application or
ingenuity in that country; that they
were a poor, miserable, dejected hand-
ful of people; that if means had been
put into their hands, yet they had so
abandoned themselves to despair, and
so sunk under the weight of their mis-
fortune, that they thought of nothing
but starving. One of them, a grme
and sensible man, told me he was con-
vinced they were in the wrong; that it
was not the part of wise men to give
themselves up to their misery, but
always to take hold of the helps which
reason offered, as well for present sup-
port as for future deliverance: he told
me that grief was the most senseless
insignificant passion in the world, for
that it regarded only things past, which
were generally impossible to lie recal-
led, or to be remedied, but had no
views of things to come, and had no
share in any thing that looked like de-
liverance, but rather added to the
 
 
2m
affliction than proposed a remedy; and
upon this he - repeated a Spanish pro-
verb, which though 1 cannot repeat in
just the same words that he spoke it
In, yet I remember I made it into an
English proverb of my own, thus:
In trouble to be trouhlfd,
Is te have your trouble doubted.
He ran-on-then in remarks upon all
the tittle improvements 1 had made in
my solitude; my unwearied applica-
tion, as he called it} and how I 'had
made a condition which in its circum-
stances was at first much worse than
theirs, a thousand timet more happy
than theira was, even now when they
were ail together. He told me it was
remarkable that  Englishmen had ^ a
greater presence of mind in their dis-
tress,* than any people that ever he met
with: that their unhappy nation and
the Portuguese were the worst men in
the world to straggle with misfortunes;
for that their -first step in dangers, after
the common efforts were over, was to
despair, lie down under it, and die,
without rousing their thoughts up to
proper remedies for escape.
I told him their case and mine dif-
fered exceedingly; that they were cast
upon the shore without necessaries,
without supply of food, or present sus-
tenance till they could provide; that,
it was true, I had this disadvantage and
discomfort, that I was alone; but then
the supplies I had providentialiy thrown
into my hands, by the unexpected dri-
ving of the ihip on shore, was such a
help-as would ^ave encouraged any
creature in the world to have  applied
himself as I had done. Seignior, says
the Spaniard, had we poor Spaniards
been in your case, we should never have
got half those things out of the ship,
as you did: nay, says he, we should
never have found means to have got a
raft to carry them, or to have got the
raft on shore without boat or sail: awl
how much less should we have done if
any of us had been alone! Well, I de-
sired him to abate his compliment, and
go on with the history of their coming
on shore, where they landed. He told
me they unhappily landed at a place
where*there were people -without-pro-
visions; whereas* had they had the
common sense'to have put off to'sea
again, and gone to another island' a
little farther, they had found provisions,
though without people; there "-being
an island that way, as they  had been
told, where there were provisions,
though no people; that is to1 lay,  that
the "Spaniards of Trinidad had fre-
quently been there, and had filled-the
island with goats and hogs-at several
times, where they had bred in such mul-
titudes, ' and where turtle and sea-fowls
were in such plenty, that they could have
been in -no want of iesh, though? they
had found no bread j whereas here, .'they
were only sustained with afewrootrand
herbs, which they understood not, -and
which had no substance in them, and
which the inhabitants gave them spa-
ringly enough; and who could treat
them no better, unless they would turn
cannibals, and eat men's flesh, which
mm the great dainty of their country,
Thev gave me an account how many
ways tliey strove to civilize the savages
they were with, and to teach the in ra-
tional customs in the ordinary way of
living, but in vain; and how they re-
torted it upon them, as unjust, that
they, who came there for assistance
and support, should attempt-to set Up
for instructors' of those that gave them
food; intimating, it seems, "that none
should set up for the instructors :of
others but those who could - live with-
out them.
They gave me dismal accounts-of
the extremities they were driven to;
how sometimes- they were many days
without any food at all, the island they
were upon • being inhabited by a sort of
savages that Mved more indolent*-'and
for that reason were less supplied -with
the necessaries of life, than they'had
reason to, believe others were 'in-the
same part of the world; and yet -they
found that these savages were less ra-
venous and voracious than those who
had better supplies of food.  Also
they added, tney could not but see
with what demonstrations of wiidom
and goodness the governing providence
of God directs the events of things- in
the -world; which, they said* appeared
in their circumstances $ for if,; pressed
by the hindships-they were-under, and
the barrenness of the country where
 
 
ADVENTURES OF
they were, they Jia<l searched after a
better to live in, they had then been
out of the way of the relief that hap-
pened to them by my means.
They then gave me an account how
the savages whom they lived among
expected them to go out with them in-
to their wars; and, it was true, that as
they had fire-arms with them, had they
not had the disaster to lose their am-
munition, they should have been ser-
viceable not only to their friends, but
have made themselves terrible both to
friends and enemies; but being with-
out powder and shot, and yet in a con-
dition that they could not- iu reason
deny to go out with their landlords to
their wars, so when they came into
the field of battle, they were in a worse
condition than the savages themselves;
for they had neither bows nor arrows,
nor could they use those the savages
gave them; so they could do nothing
but stand still, and be wounded with
arrows, till they came up to the teeth
of their enemy; and then, indeed, the
three halberds they had were of use to
them 5 and they would often drive a
whole little army before them with
those halberds, and sharpened sticks
put into the muzzles of their muskets:
but that, for all this, they were some-
times surrounded with multitudes, and
in great danger from their arrows, till
at last they found the way to make
themselves large targets of wood,
which they covered with skins of wild
beasts, whose names they knew not,
and these covered them from the ar-
rows of the savages: that, notwith-
standing these, they were sometimes in
great danger; and five of them were
once knocked down together with the
clubs of the savages, which was the
time when one of them was taken pri-
soner, that is to say, the Spaniard
whom I had relieved / that at first they
thought he had been killed; but when
Jthey afterwards heard he was taken
prisoner, they were under the greatest
grief imaginable, and would willingly
have all ventured their lives to have
rescued him.
They told me that when they were
so knocked down, the rest of their
company rescued them, and stood over
them fighting till they were come to
themselves, all but him who they
thought had been dead; and then they
made their way with their halberds and
pieces, standing close together in a
line, through a body of above a
thousand savages, beating down all
that came in their way, got the victory
over their enemies, but to their great
sorrow, because it was with the loss of
their friend, whom the other party,
finding him alive, carried oflf, with
some others, as I gave an account be-
fore.
They described most affectionately
how they were surprised with joy at
the return of their friend and com-
panion in misery, who, they thought,,
had been devoured by wild beasts of
the worst kind, viz. by wild men j and
yet how more and more they were
surprised with the account he gave
them of his errand, and that there
was a Christian in any place near,
much more one that was able, and had
humanity enough, to contribute to their
deliverance.
They described how they were as-
tonished at the sight of the relief I
sent them, and at the appearance of
loaves of bread, things they had not
seen since their coming to that miser-
able place; how often they crossed
and blessed it as bread sent from
Heaven; and what a reviving cordial it
was to their spirits to taste it, as also
the other things I had sent for their
supply: and, after ail, they would
have told me something of the joy
they were in at the sight of a boat and
pilots, to carry them away to the per-
son and place from whence all these
new comforts came, but it was im-
possible to express it by words, for
their excessive joy naturally driving
them to unbecoming extravagances,
they had no way to describe them, but
by telling roe they bordered upon
lunacy, having no way to give vent to
their passions suitable to the sense
that was upon them; that in some it
worked one way, and in some another;
and that some of them through a sur-
prise of joy, would burst into tears,
others be stark mad, and others imme-
diately faint. This discourse extremely
affected me, and called to my mind
Friday's ecstasy when he met his father.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
206
and the poor people's ecstacy when I
tool them up at  sea after their ship
was on lire: the joy of the mate of the
ship when he- found himself delivered
Iti the place where lie expected to
perish; and my own joy, when, after
twenty-eight years' captivity, 1 found
& good ship ready to carry me 'to my
own country. All these things made
rae more sensible of the relation of
these poor men, and more affected
with it.
Having thus given a view of the
state of things 'as ! found them* 1
must relate the heads of what I did for
these people, and the condition in
which I left them. It was their
opinion, and mine too, that they would
he troubled no more with the sa?ages,
or, if they were, they would he able to
cut them off, if they were twice as
many as before; so they had no con-
cern about that. Then I entered into a
serious discourse with the Spaniard,
whom I call governor, about their stay
in the island; for m I was not come
to carry any of them off, so it would
not be jlist to carry off some and leave
others, who perhaps, would be un-
willing' to stay if their strength was
diminished. 6n the other hand, I
told them I came to establish them
there, not to remove them: and then I
let them know that I had brought with
me relief of sundry kinds for them;
that I had been at a great charge to
supply thenvwith all things necessary,
ai well for their convenience as their
defence; <and that I had such and such
particular' persons with me, as- well
to increase and recruit their number,
at by the particular necessary employ-
mentr which they tvew bred to, be-
injr artificers* to assist them in those
things'in which at present they were in
'want
They were all together when I
talked thus to them-, and before I de-
livered to  -them  the store* 1 had
hronght, I asked them, one by one, If
they'had entirely forgot and'buried the
first animosities that had been among
them, and'wuttid shake hands with one
another, and engage in a strict friend-
ship and anion of interest, that so there
might  be no wore misunderstandings
and jealousies. '
Will Atkins, with abundance of
frankness and good'humour, said, they
had met with affliction"' enough to
make them all sober, 'and enemies
enough to make 'them 'all friends;
that, for his part, he would live and
die with them; and was so far from
designing any thing against '"the
Spaniards, that he owned they 'had
done nothing to him but what his owri
mad humour made* necessary, and
what he would have clone, and perhaps
worse, in their ease; and that he would
ask them pardon, if I desired it," for
the foolish and brutish things he had
done ' to them, and was ' very willing
and desirous of living in terms of en-
tire friendship and union with them,
and would'do any thing that' lay In
his power to convince theft of it; and
as for going to England, he cared not
if he did not go thither these1 twenty
years.
The Spaniards said they had, in-
deed, at first disarmed and excluded
Will Atkins and his two countrymen
for their ill conduct, as they had let
me know, and they appealed to me
for the necessity they were under to
do so; but that Will Atkins 'had t>c*
haved himself so bravely in the great
fight they had with' the savages,:' and
on several occasions since, and' had
showed himself so faithful to, and"con-
cerned for, the general interest of them
all, that they had forgotten all that was
past, and thought he merited'as muefc
to be trusted with arms, and suppled
with necessaries, as any- of them; and
they had testified their satisfaction In
him, by committing the command 'in
him, next to the governor1 hintft&h**
and -as they had entire confidence1 in
him, and all his countrymen,- so-tfcey
acknowledged they had merited '"thai
confidence 'by all the - methods that
honest mm could merit to he valued
and'trusted; and they most heartily
embraced the oecasion of giving me
this assurance, that they would -never
have any interest separate from one
another. •    "! -
Upon these frank and 'open1 decla-
rations of friendship, we appointed' the
next day to'dine all together? "and,
indeed, we' made a splendid feast 1

ADVENTURES OF
 
come on shore and dress our dinner,
and the old eook's-mate we had on
shore assisted. We brought on shore
six pieces of good beef, and four
pieces of pork, out of the ship's pro-
vision, with our punch-bow!, and ma-
terials to till it; and, in particular, I
gave them ten bottles of French
claret, and ten bottles of English beer;
things that neither the Spaniards nor
the English had tasted for many years,
and which, it may be supposed, they
were very glad of The Spaniards
added to our feast five whole kids,
which the cooks roasted; and three of
them were sent, covered up close, on
board the ship to the seamen, that they
might feast on fresh meat from on
.shore, as we did with their salt meat
from on board.
After this feast, at which we were
very innocently merry, I brought out
my cargo of goods; wherein, that there
might be no dispute about dividing, I
showed them that there was a suf-
ficiency for them all, desiring that
they might ail take an equal quantity
of the goods that were for wearing;
that is to say, equal when made up.
As, first, I distributed linen sufficient
to make every one of them four
shirts, and, at the Spaniards' request,
afterwards made them up six; these
were exceeding comfortable to them,
having been what, as I may say, they
had long since forgot the use of, or
what it was to wear them. I allotted
the thin English stuffs, which I men-
tioned before, to make every one a
light coat like a frock, which I judged
fittest for the heat of the season, cool
and loose; and ordered that whenever
they decayed they should make more,
as they thought fit; the like for
pumps, shoes, stockings, hats, &e.
I cannot express what pleasure,
what satisfaction sat upon the coun-
tenances of all these poor men, when
they saw the care I had taken of them,
and how well I had furnished them.
They told me I was a father to them;
and that having such a correspondent
as I was in so remote a part of the
world, it would make them forget that
they were left in a desolate place; and
they all voluntarily engaged to me not
to leave the place without my consent.
Then I presented to them the people
I had brought with me, particularly
the tailor, the smith, and the two car-
penters, all them most necessary peo-
ple; but, above all, my general artifi-
cer, than whom they could not name
any thing that was more useful to
them; and the tailor, to show his con-
cern for them, went to work immedi-
ately, and, with my leave, made them
every one a shirt, the first thing he
did; and, which was still more, he
taught the women not only how to sew
and stitch, and use the needle, but
made them assist to make the shirts
for their husbands, and for all the
rest.
As to the carpenters, I scarce need
mention how useful they were; for
they took to pieces all my clumsy, un-
handy things, and made them clever
convenient tables, stools, bedsteads,
cupboards, lockers, shelves, and every
thing they wanted of that kind, But
to let them see how nature had made
artificers at first, I carried the carpen-
ters to see Will Atkins's basket-house,
as I called it: and they both owned
they never saw an instance of such na-
tural ingenuity before, nor any thing so
regularly and so handily built, at least of
its kind; and one of them, when he saw
it, after musing a good while, turning
about to me, I am sure, says he, that
man has no need of us; you need do
nothing but give him took.
Then I brought them out all my
store of took, and gave every man a
digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake,
for we had no harrows or ploughs;
and to every separate place a pick-axe,
a crow, a broad axe, and a saw; always
appointing, that as often as any were
broken or worn out they should be
supplied, without grudging, out of the
general stores that I left behind.
Nails, staples, hinges, hammers, chi-
sels, knives, seissars, and all sorts of
iron-work, they had without tale, as
they required; for no man would take
more than he wanted, and he must be
a fool that would waste or spoil them
on any account whatever; and, for the
use of the smith, J left two tons of un-
wrought iron for a supply.
My magazine o£ powder and arm*
which 1 brought them was such, even
20?
 
to profusion,'they could not but re-
joice 'at them: for  now they could
'march m I used to do, with a musket
11 poii-cadi shoulder, if there was occa-
sion^ and were able to'fight » thou-
sand savages, if they had'but some
little advantages" of situation, which
also they could not miss, if they had
occasion.
1 carried on shore with me the
young man whose mother was starved
to death, and the maid also: she was a
sober, well-educated, religions young
woman, and-behaved so inoffensively,
that every one gave her a good word;
she had, indeed, an unhappy life with
us, there being no woman in the ship
hut herself, but she bore it with pa-
tience. After a while, seeing thing's so
well ordered, and in so fine a way of
thriving upon my island, and consider-
ing that they had neither business nor
acquaintance' in ttaf last Indies, or
reason for taking so long a voyage; 1
say, considering all this, "both of them
came to me, and desired I would give
them leave to remain on  the island,
and be entered among my family, as
they called it. I agreed to this rea-
dily; and they had a little of plot
ground 'allotted to them, where they
had three tents or houses set up, sur-
rounded with a basket-work, pallisa-
doecl like Atkins's, adjoining to his
plantation. Their tents were contrived
so that they had each of them a room
apart to lodge in, and a middle tent,
like a great store house, 'to lay their
goods in, and to eat and drink in.
And now the other two Englishmen re-
moved 'their habitation to the same
place; and so the island was divided
into three colonies, and no more, viz.
the ' Spaniards, - with old Friday, and
the first servants, at my old habitation
under the hill, which was, in a word,
the* capital city j and where they had so
enlarged' and' extended their works, as
well under as on the outside of the hill,
that; they lived* though perfectly con-
cealed/ yet full at large/ Never was
there sueh a little city in a wood, and
so hid, in any part of the world j for 1
verily believe- a thousand 'men might
have ranged the island a'month, and, if
they had not" known there was such a
thing, and looked on purpose for, it,
they would not have found it; • for the
trees stood so thick and so' close,' Wd,
grew so fast-woven one into. vanQt{tief» s
that nothing but cutting theiti, down
first could discover' the place,, except
the only two narrow entrances where
they went in and out could be found,, -
which was not very easy; one of them
was close down at the water's edge, on ,
the side of the creek, and it was after-
wards above two hundred yards to the
place; and the other was up a ladder
at twice, as 1 have already formerly
described it; and they had also a large
wood thick-planted on the top of the hill,
containing above an acre, which grew
apace, and concealed the place from
all discovery there, with only one nar-
row place between two trees, not easily
to be discovered, to enter on'that side..
The other colony was that of'Will
Atkins, where there were "four families
of Englishmen,- I mean those 1 had
left there, with their wives and children -f
three savages that %?ere slaves;' the .
widow and the children of the English-,
man that was killed; the young* man

made a wife of her before we went
away. There was also the two car-
penters and the tailor, whom I brought
with me for them; also the smith,
who was a very necessary man to them,
especially as a gunsmith, to take care
of their arms; and my other man.,
whom I called Jack of all trades, who
was in himself as good almost as
twenty men; for he was not only a
very ingenious fellow, but a very merry
fellow; and before I went away we.
married him to the honest maia that,

of protestants: us* first, that be was
a Papist; secondly, a Popish priest;
and, thirdly, a French Popish priest.
But justice demands of me to give him
a due character; and I must say, lie
was a grave, sober, pious, and most
religious person j exact in his life,
extensive in his charity, and exem-
plary in almost every thing he did.
What then can any one say against
being very sensible of the value of
such a man, notwithstanding his pro-
fession? though it may be my opinion,
perhaps, as well as the opinion of
others who shall read ihU, that he
was mistaken.
The first hour that I began to con-
verse with him after he had agreed to
go with me to the East Indies, I found
reason to delight exceedingly in his
conversation; and he tirst began with
me about religion in the most oblig-
ing manner imaginable. Sir, says
he, you have not only under God (and
M that he crossed his breast) saved my
life, but you have admitted me to
go this voyage in your ship, and by
your obliging civility have taken me
Into your family, giving me an oppor-
tunity of free conversation. Now, sir,
you see by my habit what my pro-
fession is, and I guess by your nation
what yours is; I may think it is my
duty, and doubtless it is so, to use my
utmost endeavours, on all occasions,
to bring all the souls I can to the
knowledge of the truth, and to embrace
the catholic doctrine; but as I am
here under your permission, and in
your family, I am bound, in justice
to your kindness, as well as in decency
anfl good manners, to be under your
government; and therefore I shall
not, without your leave, enter into
any debate on the points of religion
in which we may not agree, farther
than you shall give me leave,
I told hira his carriage was so modest,
that I could not but acknowledge it;
that it was true, we were sudb people
as they called heretics, but that he was
not the first catholic I had conversed
with, without failing into inconve-
niences, or carrying the questions to
any height in debate; that he should
r not find himself the worse used for
being of a different opinion from us;
and if we did not converse without any
dislike on either side, it should be his
fault, not ours.
He replied that he thought all our
conversation might be easily separated
from disputes; that it was not his
business to cap principles with even-
man he conversed with; and that he
rather desired me to converse with hiiu
as a gentleman than as a religionist;
and that, if I would give him leave at
any time to discourse upon religions
subjects he would readily comply with
it, and that he did not doubt but I
would allow him also to defend his own
opinions as well as he could; hut that,
without my leave, he would not break
in upon me with any such thing. He
told me farther, that he would not
cease to do all that became him, in his
office as a priest m well as a private
Christian, to procure the good of the
ship, and the safety of all that was in
her; and though, perhaps, we would
not join with him, and he could not
pray with us, he hoped he might pray
for us, which he would do upon alt oc-
casions. In this manner we conversed;
and, m he was of the most obliging,
gentle man-like behaviour, so he was,
if I may be allowed to say so, a man of
good sense, and, as I believe, of great
learning.
He gave me a most diverting account
of his life, and of the many extraordi-
nary events of it; of many adventures
which had befallen hirn in the few
years that he had been abroad in the
world; and particularly this was very
remarkable, viz, that in the voyage be
was now engaged in, he had the mis-
fortune to be five times shipped and
unshipped, and never to go to the place
whither any of the ships he was in
were at first designed. That his first
intent was to have gone to Martinko,
and that he went on board a ship
Ijpund thither at St. Malo: but, being
. forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the
ship received some damage by running
aground in the mouth of the river Ta-
gus, and was obliged to unload her
cargo there; but finding a Portuguese
ship there bound to the"Madeiras, and
ready to sail, and supposing he should
2W
 
tawly-' meet with a vtsasel.there bound
to'. Martioico, he went ott board, in
order to sail to the Madeira* j but the
minter of the Portuguese skip,, being
bill -an iudittereiit mariner, bad been
out of .his .ret!kaitiiig% and they drove
to-Pplj.. where, however, he hap-
pened to find a very good market for
his cargo., which was corn, and there-
fore •'resolved not tii go to the Ma-
deiras, but to load sail at the Me of
May, and to-go away-to Newfound-
land, lie had., no remedy iu this

had a pretty good voyage as far m the

France, *iu. the" ship that was burned
when \vc took them up at'sea; .and
then shipped , wjtb m. for /he East
Indies, m t have already said.^ Thus
he -had been . disappointed in five
voyages, all, as 1 may rail it, in one
voyage, besides what I shall have oc-
sion to mention farther of, the same
person. ,
But I shall hot make digression into
other men's stories, which have no
relation "to m f own; .1 return to what
concerns oUr affaira in the island.' He
canie to .' me' one morning, for lie
lodged among us 'all the while we
wei:e'.-up.Qn't]ie island, and it happened
to be just when, 1 was going" to visit
the'Englishmen's colony*'at. the farthest
part;of "flic"island»"I say, 'he 'came to

#Utlieaafiee, that''"he had for two or
'three' days' desired an opportunity of

thoiight it was, in the way of Clod's

I looked a little surprised at the
latit part of, his discourse, and. turning
a little short, flow, sir," said I, 'can it
be said that we are not in the way fif
God's blessing, after such vIsIMq as-
sistances and*" wonderful "delirerAiices
m we have seen here, and of which" 1
have given you a large account?*—If
you had pleased, sir, said he, 'with a
world of modesty, and, yet with* great
readiness, to have heard mo, you
would have found no room to hare
been displeased, much less to think
so hard of me, that I should 'suggest
that you hare not had wonderful as-
sistances and deliverances; and 1
hope, on your behalf, hat you are in
the way of God's blessing, as your
design is exceeding good, and will
prosper: but, sir," though it were
more so than is even possible to you,
yet there may bo some among you
'that are not equally right in their
actions.; and you "know, that in the
story of the children , of Israel,, one
Achan in the camp removed God's
blessing from them, and turned Ms
hand 'so against them, that. sis ami
thirty of them, though not concerned
lit the .crime, were the objects _ of di-
vine vengeance,, and bore the weight
of that punishment
1 was sensibly touched with his dis-
course, and told him his inference
was'so just, and the whole' design
seemed so sincere, and was really go
religious in its own nature, that I Was
very sorry I had interrupted him, arid
begged him to go on: . and,- in _ the
mean time, because it seemed that
what we had both to say' might take
up some time, 1 told him 1 was going
to the Englishmen's 'plantations, and
asked him'to go with me,J'arid:,we
might discourse' of it by the way. He
tolcl me he would the m#fe willingly

partly the thing was acted which' he
desired to speal to me 'about; so we
walked on,-'and F pressed'hini'to be
free and plain' with me "in what he 'ttttil
to say;'' ''"' " "' . ',
Why then, sir, says he, 'be pleased
to give rne leave to lay down a few pro*
positions, as the foundation of what'I
lave to'say, that we mat not-differln

be of gome differing opinions in the
practice of particulars. First, sir,
though we differ in some of the doc-
trinal articles of religion, and it is
very unhappy it is so, especially in
the case before us, as 1 shall show
afterwards, yet there are some general
principles in which we both agree,
viz. that there is a God; and that
this (rod having given us some stated
general rules for our service and obe-
dience, we ought not willingly and
knowingly to offend him, either by
neglecting to do what he has com-
manded, or by doing what he has ex-
pressly forbidden: and let our dif-
ferent religions be what they will, this
general principle is readily owned by
us all, that the blessing of God does
not ordinarily follow presumptuous
sinning against his command; and
every good Christian will be affection-
ately concerned to prevent any that
are under his care living in a total
neglect of God and his commands,
It is not your men being Protestants,
whatever my opinion may be of such,
that discharges me from being con-
cerned for their souls, and from en-
deavouring, if it lies before me, that
they should live in as little distance
from enmity with their Maker as pos-
sible, especially if you give me leave
to meddle so far in your circuit.
I could not yet imagine what he
aimed at, and told him 1 granted all he
had said, and thanked bin* that he
would so far concern himself for us;
and begged he would explain the
particulars of what he had observed,
that, like Joshua, to take his own
parable, I might put away the ac-
cursed thing from us.
Why then, sir, says he, I will take
the liberty you give "me; and there are
three things, which, if I am right,
must stand in the way of God's
blessing upon your endeavours here,
and which 1 should rejoice, for your
sake, and their own, to see removed;
and, sir, I promise myself that you will
fully agree with me in them all, as
soon as I name them; especially be-
cause I shall convince you that every
one of then) may, with great ease, and
/very .much to. your satisfaction, be
! remedied. First, sir, says he, you
have here four Englishmen, who haie
fetched women from among the sa-
vages, and have taken them as their
wives, and have had many children by
them all, and yet are not married to
them after any stated, legal maimer,
as the laws of God and man require;
and therefore are yet, in the sense of
both, no less than fornicators, if not
living in adultery. To this, sir, I
know you will object that there was
no clergyman or priest of any kind, or
of any profession, to perform the
ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or
paper, to write down a contract of
marriage, and have it signed between
them: and I know also, sir, what the
Spaniard governor has told you, I
mean, of the agreement that he
obliged them to make when they took
those women, viz. that they should
choose them out by consent, and keep
separately to them; which, by the
way, is nothing of a marriage, no
agreement with the women, as wives,
but only an agreement among them-
selves, to keep them from quarrelling.
But, sir, the essence of the sacrament
of matrimony (so he called it, being a
Roman) consists not only in the
mutual consent of the parties to take
one another as man and wife, but in
the formal and legal obligation that
there is in the contract, to compel the
man and woman, at all times, to own
and acknowledge each other; obliging
the man to abstain from all other
women, to engage in no other con-
tract while these subsist, and, on all
occasions, as ability allows, to provide
honestly for them and their children;
and to oblige the women to the same,
or like conditions, mutatis mutandis,
on their side. Now, sir, says he,
these men may, when they please or
when occasion presents, abandon these
women, disown their children, leave
them to perish, and take other women,
and marry them while these are living:
and here he added, with some warmth,
How, sir, is God honoured in this
unlawful liberty? and how shall a
blessing succeed your endeavours in
this place, however good in themselves,
and however sincere in your design,
while these men, who at present are
your subjects, under your absolute
 
 
211
 
government and dominion, are al-
lowed by you to lire in open adultery?
1 confess 1 was struck with the
thing itself, but much more with the
convincing arguments he supported it
with; for it wm certainly true, that
though they had no clergyman upon
the spot, "yet a formal contract on
both sides, made before witnesses, and
confirmed by any token which they
had all agreed to be bound by, though
it had been but breaking a stick be-
tween them, engaging the men to
own these women for their wives upon
all occasions, anil never to abandon
them or their child nut, and the women
to the same with their husbands, had
been an effectual lawful marriage in
the sight of God; and it was a great
neglect that it was not done, tint I
thought to have got off my young
priest by telling him all that part was
done when I was not here; and they
had lived so many years with them
now, that if it was adultery,' it was
past remedy; they could do nothing in
it now.
Sir, says he, asking your pardon for
such freedom, you are right in this,
that, it being done in your absence,
you could not be charged with that
part of the crime; but, 1 beseech you,
flatter not yourself that you are not
therefore under an obligation to do
your utmost now to put an end to it.
How can you think but that, let the
time past lie on whom it will, all the
'guilt, for the future, will lie entirely
upon you? because it is certainly in
your power now to put an end to it,
and in nobody's power but yours.
I was so dull still, that 1 did not
take him right; but I imagined that,
by putting an end to it, he meant that
1* should pari them, and not suffer
them to live together any longer: and
I said to Mm I could not do that, by
any means, for that it would put the
whole island into confusion. He
seamed surprised that 1 should m far
mistake' him. No, sir, says he, !do
'not'mean that you should now separate
them, but legally and effectually marry
'them now; ami "as, sir, my way Of mar-
rying them may not be easy to recon-
cile them to, though it will be effec-
tual, eten t>y your own laws, so your
way may be as well before God, and as
valid among men; I mean, by a writ-
ten contract signed by both man and
woman, and by all the witnesses pre-
sent, which all the laws of Europe
would decree to be valid.
I was amazed to sec so much true
piety, and so much sincerity of zeal,
besides tfie unusual impartiality in his
discourse as to his own party or chiirtii,
and such true warmth for preserving
the people that he hail no knowledge
of or relation to; 1 say, for preserving
them from transgressing the laws of
God, the like of which J had indeed not
met with any where: but, recollecting
what he had said of marrying them by
a written contract, whiclt I knew he
would stand to, 1 returned it back upon
him, and told him, I granted all that
he had said to be just, and on his part
very kind \ that I would discourse with
the men upon the point now, when I
came to them; and I knew no reason
why they should scruple to let him
marry them all, which I knew well
enough would be granted to be as au-
thentic and valid in England as if they
were married by one of our own cler-
gymen; what was afterwards (lone in
this matter, ! shall speak of by itself.
1 then pressed him to tell me what
was the second complaint which he
had to make, acknowledging that 1
was very much his debtor for the first*
and thanked him heartily for it. He
told me he would use the same free-
dom and plainness in the second, and
hoped I would take it as well; and this
was, that notwithstanding these English
subjects of mine, as he called them,
hao? lived with those women for almost
seven years, had taught them to speak
English, and even to read it, aad that
they were, as he perceived, women of
tolerable understanding, mud capable
of Instruction, yet they had not, to this
hour, taught them any thing of the
Christian religion, no, not so much'te
to know that there was a God, 'or a
worship, or in what manner God was
to fie served j or that their own idola-
try, and worshipping they knew not
whom, was false and ahsuro. This, he
said, was an unaccountable negkttft,
'ami what God.would certainly «dl
them to aedbuni for, and perltafM, at

last, take tie Work out of their hands
—he spoke this very affectionately, and
warmly. 1 am persuaded, says he,
had those men lived in the , savage
country whence their wives came, the
savages wouki have tali en more pains
to have brought them to be idolaters,
and to worship the devil, than any of
these men, so far as 1 can see, have
taken with them to teach them the
knowledge of the true Clod. Now, sir,
said he, "though 1 do not acknowledge
your religion, or yon mine, yet we
"would be" glad to see the devirs .ser-
vants, and the subjects of his kingdom,
taught to know the general principles
of the Christian religion; that they
might, at least, hear of God and a Re-
deemer, and of the resurrection unci of
»' future state,-—things which we ail
believe; they had, at least, been so
much nearer coming into the bosom of
the true church than they arc now, in
the public profession of idolatry and
devil-worship.
1 could hold no longer; 1 took him
in in? arms, and embraced hirn with an
excess of passion. How far, said 1 to
him, have ! been from understanding
.the most essential part of a Christian!
.viz. to love the interest of the Christian
-chureh, and the good of other men's
'souls: 1 scarce have known what be-
longs to the' being-a Christian,—(), sir,
.do not say so, replied he; this thing is
•not your fault.—No, said 1; but why
did I never lay it to heart as well as
well as yon?-—Il is not too late yet,
^ftid lie; be not too forward to con-
demn yourself.—But what can be done
now? said I; yon see 1 am going
:iway.—Will you give me leave to talk
with these poor men about it?-—Yes,
with all my heart, said I; and will
oblige tlteitt to give heed to what you
*ay too.*—As to that, said he* we must
leave them to the mercy of Christ;
Hut it is your business to-asuist them,
encourage thenv and instruct them;
and if yon give me1 leave, and God Ms
blessing, 1 do not doubt'but the poor
'"ifnorant souls shall be brought home
?o''the great circle of Christianity, if
notinto'the'particular faith we alf em-
brace, and that even while you stay
litre*. Upon this I teioVI shall not
only-give' yeirleawv but- five you a
thousand thanks for it. What followed
on this account,. 1 shall mention also
again in its place,
"I now pressed him for the third ar-
ticle in which we were to blame.
Why, really, says he, it m of the same
nature; and 1 will proceed, asking
your leave, with the same plainness as
before: it is about your poor savages,
who are, as I may say, your conquered
subjects. It is a maxim, sir, that is,
or ought to be, received among all
Christians, of what church or pretended
church soever, viz.The Christian know-
ledge ought to be propagated by all
possible means, and on all possible oc-
casions. Jt is on this principle that
our church sends missionaries into
Persia, India, China; and that our
clergy, even of the superior sort, wil-
lingly engage in the most hazardous
voyages, and the most dangerous resi-
dence among murderers and barba-
rians, to teach them the knowledge of
the true God, and to bring them over
to embrace .the Christian faith. Now,
sir, you have such an opportunity here
to have six or seven and thirty poor sa-
vages brought over from idolatry to
the knowledge of God, their Maker
and Redeemer, that 1 wonder how you
can pass such an occasion of doing
good, which is really worth the ex-
pense of a-man's whole life.
I was now struck dumb, indeed, and
 had not one word to say, 1 had here
a spirit of true Christian zeal for God
and religion before me, let his particu-
lar principles be of what kind soever;
as for me, I had not so much as enter-
tained a thought of this in my heart be-
fore, and 1 believe 1 should not have
thought of it; for 1 looked upon these
savages as slaves, and people whom,
had we any work for them to do, we
would have used as such, or would
have been glad to have transported
 them to any other part of the world:
'for our business was to get rid of
• them; and we would all have been sa-
tisied if they had been sent to any
country, so they had never seen their
own. "But to the case;—-J say, I was

shall be very sorry if what 1 have saul
gives you any offence—No, no, said I,
1 am offended with nobody hut myself;
but I am perfectly confounded, not
only to think that I sh<,!-d'! never fake
any notice «»f this before, ].;u with re-
flecting what notice 1 am able to take
of it now. Yon know, sir, said I, what
circumstances I am in; I am bound to
the R*wt Indies in a ship freighted by
merchants, and to whom it would be
an insufferable piece of injustice to de-
tain their ship here, the men lying1 all
this while at victuals and wages on the
owners' account. It is true, 1 agreed
to be allowed twelve days here, and if
I stay more, I mu-<t pay three pounds
sterling pfr <lUm demurrage, nor can
I stay upon demurrage above eight days
more, audi have been here thirteen al-
ready; so that 1 am perfectly unable to
engage, in this work,unless I would stiller
mysetf to be left behind here again; itt
which ease, if this single ship should
miscarry in any part of her voyage, 1
should be just" in the same condition
that 1 was left in here at first, and from
which 1 have been so wonderfully deli-
vered, lie owned the ease was very
hard upon me, m to my voyage; but
laid it home upon my conscience, whe-
ther the blessing of saving thirty-seven
souls wras not worth venturing all I had
in the world for. 1 was not bo sensible
of that as he was. 1 returned upon
him thus: Why, sir, it is a valuable
thing, indeed, to be an instrument in
Cod's ha in 1 to convert thirty-seven hea-
thens to the knowledge of Christ; but
as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given
over to the work; so that it seems so
naturally to fall into the way of your
profession, how is It then that you do
not rather offer yourself to undertake
it, than press me to do it?
Upon this lie faced about just be-
fore me, as lie walked along, and put-
ting me to a full stop, made me a
very low bow. 1 most heartily thank
God and you, sir, said he, for giving
me so evident a call to so blessed a
work; and if you think yourself dischar-
ged from it, and desire me to undertake
It, 1 will most readily do it and think it
a happy reward for all the hazards and
'difficulties of -such a"broketi disap~
pointed voyage afe 1 hare met with
that 1 am dropped at ait into so
glorious a work. • 
I discovered ft kind of rapture in
his fare while lie spoke this to me?
his eyes sparkled like fitt, his face
glowed, and his colour came , and
Went, as if he had been falling, into
tits; in a word lie was fired with the
joy of being embarked in such  a
work. I paused a considerable while
before 1 could tell what to say to
iiiui ; for 1 was really surprised to find
a man of such sincerity and zeal*
and carried out in his zeal beyond
the ordinary rate of men, not ot his
profession only, but even of any pro-
fession whatsoever. But after 1 had
considered it awhile, 1 asked him
seriously if he was in earnest, and
that he* would venture, cm the single
consideration of an attempt on those
poor people, to be locked up in an
implanted island for perhaps his life,
and at last might not know whether
lie should he able to do them good or
not?
He turned short upon me, and ask-
ed me what I called a venture; Pray,
sir, said he, what do you think 1 em*
sen ted to go in your ship to the East
Indies for?—Nay, said 1, that 1
know  not, unless it was to preach
to the Indians.—Doubtless it was,
said he j and do you think, if I can
convert these thirty-seven men to the
faith of Jesus Christ, it is not worth
my time, though 1 should never be
fetched off the island again? nay, ii
it not infinitely >of more worth to save
so many souls than my life is, or the
life of'twenty more of the same pro-
fession? Yes, sir, soya he, I would
give Christ and the blessed Virgin
thanks all my days, if I could be
made the least happy instrument of
saving the souls of those poor wen,
though I were never to set my foot
off this island, or see my native*conn-
-try any more, ^ But since yon will
honour me with putting me into
this work, for which 1 will pray for
•you all the days of my life, I have
one humble petition to you besldex-*-
Whatisthat? said 1* Why, lays he,
it is, that you will leave your .man

1 was sensibly touchy at his re-
questing Friday, because 1 could not
think of parting with him, and that
for many reasons: he had been the
companion of my travels $ he was not
only faithful to - me, but sincerely
affectionate to the last degree; anil
I "had resolved to do something* con-

as it 'was probable he would,' Then
1 knew' that' 'as I had bred'Ft May up
to be a Protestant, it would quite
confound him to bring  him to em-
brace ' another profession; and he
would never, while his eyes were open,
believe that his old master was a here-
tic * arid would be damned; and this
might, in the end, ruin the poor
fellow's principles, and so turn him
back again to his first idolatry. How-
ever, a sudden thought relieved me in
this strait,. and it was this; I told him
I 'could not say that I was willing
to part with Friday on any account
whatever, though a work that to him
was of more value than his' life, ought
to "be to me of much more value than
the' keeping or' parting with a ser-
vant. '"But, on the other hand, I was
persuaded that Friday would by- no
means • agree  to part with roe; and I
could not force him to it without his
consent, without manifest injustice;
because ! had'promised 1 would never
put him ^away, and he had promised
and engaged to me that he would ne-
ver-'leave me- unless 1 put him
'away. • "
He seemed very much concerned
at, it, for  he had no rational access
to''these poor people seeing* he did
 not Understand one wcrd of their lan-
guage,'nor they one word of his. To
'remove this difficulty 1 told him Fri-
day's father had learned Spanish,
-which I found he also understood, and
lie "should serve him as aa interpre-
ter. ' So he was much -better satisfied,
-'aid'nothing could persuade'him but

given them of what I had (lone for
them, viz. what necessary things I
had provided for them, and how they
were distributed, which they were
very sensible of, and very thankful
for, 1 began to talk to them of
the scandalous life they led, and
gave them a full account of the no^
tict the clergyman had taken of it;
and arguing how unchristian and irre-
ligious a life it was, 1 first asked thein
if they were married men or ^ bache-
lors? They soon explained their con-
ditions to me, and showed that two
of them were widowers, and the other
three were single men, or bache-
lors. I asked them with what con-
science they could take those women
and lie with them as they had done,
call them their wives, and have so
many children by them, and not be
lawfully married to them?
They all gave me the answer f ex-
pected*, viz. "that there was nobody to
marry them; that they agreed before
the governor to keep them as their
wives, and to maintain them and own
them as their wives; aud they thought
as things stood with, .them, they were
as legally married as if they had been
married by a parson, and with all
the formalities, in the world.
I told them that no doubt they
were married in the sight of God,
and were bound in conscience to keep
them as their wives; but that the
laws of men being otherwise, they
might desert the poor women and
children hereafter; and that their
wives being poor desolate women,
friendless and moneyle ss, would
have no way to help themselves:. I
therefore told them that unless 1 p was
assured of their honest intent, I could
do nothing for them, but would take
care what 1 did should be for the wo-
men and children, without them; and
that unless they would'give me some
assurances that they would marry the
women/1 could not think it was con-
venient they should continue together
'as man and wife; -for that it was both
scandalous to men and offensive to
.God»- who they could not think would
bless them if they went on 0iusr ,
Mk
Aft this went on as I expected: and
tlicy told me, especially Will Atkins,
who now seemed to speak for the
rest, that the? loved their wives as
welt as If they" had been bom ill their
own native country, awl would not
leave them upon any account what-
ever; and the? did verily believe their
wives were as virtuous and as modest,
and did, to the  utmost of their skill,
m much for them and for their chil-
dren, as any women could possibly
do; arid they would not part with
them on any account: and Will Atkins,
for his own particular,  added, that
if any man would take him away, and
offer to carry him home to England,
and make liiin captain of the best man
of war in the navy, lie would not go
with him, if lie 'might not carry his
wife and children with him; and if
there was a clergyman in the ship be
would be married*to her now with all
his heart.
This was just as 1 would have had
it: the priest was not with me at that
moment, but was not far off; so, to
try him farther, 1 told hi in I had a
clergyman with me, and, if lie was
sincere, I would have him married
next morning, and bade him consider
of it, and talk with the rest. He said,
as for himself, he need not consider
of it at all, for he was very ready to
do it, and was glad 1 had a minister
with me, arid he believed the? would
be all willing also. I then told him
that my friend the minister, was a
Frenchman, and could not speak En-
glish, but 1 would act the clerk be-
tween them. He never so much as
asked me whether he was a Papist or
Protestant, which was- indeed what 1
was afraid of; so we parted; 1 went
back to my clergyman, and Will
Atkins went in to talk with his com-
panions. 1 desired the French gentle-
men not to say any thing to them
till the business was thoroughly ripe;
and 1 told him what answer the men
.had given me.
Before ! went from their quarter,
they all came- to me, and told me1 that -
they had been considering-what Iliad
said': that they were glad to hear I
had a /clergyman-'  in  .my' - company,
mid they were very willing*fe'give.me -

though he had not on a miuister*s
gown, after the manner of England,
or the habit of a , priest, after the
manner of France, yet having a black
vest, something like ft cassock, with
a sash round it, he did not look very
unlike a minister; and as for hk lan-
guage, I was his interpreter, , But
the seriousness of his behaviour. ,,to
them, and the - scruples he made.,of
marrying the women, because they
were not baptized and professed
Christians, gave them an exceeding
reverence for Ms person; and.there

-lib fold tltem»'that in tlit sight 'of nil
indifferent men, and in the sense of
th ft daws of society, they had lived ill
this while In open fornication; and
that it was true* that nothing' but 'the
consenting to ' marry, or effectually
-separating them from one another,
could now-put an end to it; hut there
was a difficulty in it too, with res-
pect to the laws of Christian matrimo-
ny, which he was not fully satisfied
about, viz, that of marrying  one that
is -< a professed Christian to a savage,
an idolater and a heathen, one that" is
not baptized; and yet that lie did not see
that there was time left to endeavour to
persuade the women to lie baptised', or
to profess the name of Christ, whom
they had, he doubted, heard nothing
of, find without which they could
not be baptised. He told them lie
doubted tliey were but indifferent
Christians themselves; that they had
but little knowledge of God or of
his-ways, and therefore lie could not
'expect that they had said much to
their wives on that head yet; but that
,unless they would promise him to use
their endeavours with their wives to
persuade them to become Christians,
and would, as well as the? could, in-
struct- them in the knowledge and
-belief of God that made them, and
to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed
tltein, be could not marry them; for
he-'would hare no hand in joining
Christians with savages; nor was  it
consistent with the principles of the
Christian religion* and was indeed
expressly forbidden in Cod's law.
They heard all this very attentively,
and I'delivered it'very faithfully to
them from his mouth, as near* Ms
own words as 1 could; only some-
times -adding something of my own, to
convince them how just it 'was, and
how 1 was of his mind: and 1 always
very faithfully distinguished between
what' 1 said from myself, and what
were the clergyman's words. They
Sold me;it was very true what' the
gentleman-said, that they were-very
Indifferent Christians themselves, -ana
that they had never talked to their
wives? about religion.  Lord, sir, says
Will 'Atkins,; how should- we- teach
them religion? -why, wf know nothing
ourselves} and' besides,' sir, sail'he
should we talk- to them-of God and
Jesus Christ,' and heaven and hell, it
would make the in laugh at us, and
ask ns what we believe ourselves?
And if we should tell theov that we
believe all the things we speak of
to them, such as of good - people
going to heaven, and wicked people to
the devil, they would ask us where we
intended to go-ourselves, that believe
all this, and'are such wicked fellows
as we indeed are? Why, sir,''tis enough
to give them a surfeit of religion >at
first hearing; folks must  hare some
religion themselves before they pre-
tend to teach other people.—Will
Atkins, said 1 to him, though  1 am
afraid that what you say has too much
truth in ir, yet 'can you not tell your
wife she is in the wrong; that there is
a God, and a religion better than her
own; that her gods are idols; that
they can neither hear nor speak •,
that there is a' great Being that made
all things, and that can destroy all
that he has made; that he rewards
the good and punishes the bad; and
that 'we are to be judged by him at
last for all we do here?"" You are not
so ignorant, hut even nature itself
will "teach you that all-this is true;
and ! am satisfied you know it all to
be true, and believe it yourself.—
That is true, sir, said Atkins; but -
with what face can 1 say'any thing to
my wife of all this, when she will
tell me immediately it cannot' be
true ?—Not true! said 1; what do you
mean by that?—Why, sir, said "he,
she will tell mc it cannot be true that
this God 1 shall tell her of can be
just* or can punish or reward, since
1 am not punished and sent to the
devil, that have been such a wicked
creature as she knows 1 have been,
even to her and to every body else; and
that I should' he suffered to live, that
have been always acting so con*
trary to what 1 muat tell her is good,
and to what 1 ought to have done.—
Why, - truly, Atkins, said I,' I mm
afraid thou speakest too much truth-;
and with that I informed tlie clergy-
man-of what Atkins had saMi'-for be
was impatient to: know, .0,'said;the
priest, tell '.him' there  is one- thing
 
 
tir
 
will make him the best minister in
tltf world to his wife, and that is,
repentance; for none teach repentance
like true penitents. He wants nothing
Iwit to repent, and then he will he so
much the better qualified to instruct
his wife: lie will then lie ahle to tell
her that,there h not only a God, and
that lie is the just rewarder of good
and evil, hut that, lie is a merciful
being, awl vvith infinite goodness and
long-suffering forbears tO'puuitdi those
that offend | waiting to be gracious
and willing not the death of a sin-
ner, but rather that lie should return
and live: that oftentimes he suffers
wicked men to go a long time and
even reserves damnation to the general
day of retribution; that it is a clear
evidence of God and of a future state,
that righteous men receive not their
reward, or wicked men their punish-
ment, till they come into another
world: find this will lead him to
teach his wife the doctrine of the re-
surrection and of the last judgment.
Let liini but repent for himself, he
will be an excellent preacher of re-
pentance to his wife,
I repeated all thin to Atkins, who
looked very serous all the while, and
who, we could easily perceive, wag
more than ordinarily affected, with it:
when being eager, and hardly suffer-
ing me to make an end—1 know all
this*  master, says lie, and a great
deal more; but t have not the impu-
dence to talk thus to my wife, when
God aacl my consience know, and my
wife will be an undeniable evidence
against me, that J have lived as if 1
had never heard of a God or future
state, or any thing about it; and to
talk of my repenting, alas I (and with
that he fetched a deep sigh, and I
could sec that the tears stood in his
eyes)'tis past all that with me—Past it
Atkins? said 1; what dost thou mean
by that?—I know well 'enough what!
mean, says he; 1 mean 'tis too late,
and that is too true.  .
 I told'the clergyman^ word for word,
what .he' 'Said:  the poor .zealous priest,
—1 must call him so, for, be his opi-
nion wliat.it -will, lie had'certainly a
mmt singular affection for the good* of
othtr men's souls, mid-it would be hard
to think lie -had-not'the ttke for "Ms
own,—I say, . this- uftevtiotmtP tiiln
could not refrain from tears; but re-
covering himself, aaid to nu% A«*k Win
but one question; h he easy that it-ia
too lute; or h he troubled, and Wishes
it were not so? 1 put the question 'fairly
to< Atkins and he answered, with a
great deal of passion, fCow could uhy
mau be easy in a condition that must
certainly end in eternal destruction?
that lie was fur from being cusy$ but
that, on the contrary, lie believed ft
would, one time or other, ruin him*
What do you wean by that? said L
Why, lie said, he believed he should
one time or other cut hi* throat, to put
fin end to the terror of it.
The clergyman shook his head, with
great concern in.hh face, when 1 told
him all this; but; turning quick tome
upon it, says, If that be hia case, we
may assure him it is not too late;
Christ will give him repentance 3nif
pray, say.s he, explain tin* to him; that
as no man is saved but by Chrittt, and
the merit of his pa&aion procuring di*
vine mercy for him, how can it be too
late for any man to receive mercy?
Does he think he is aide to sin beyond
the power or reach of divine roetliyf
Pray tell him, there may be a time
when provoked mercy will no longer
strive, and when God may refuse" to
hear, but that it is never too late
for men to ask mercy 5 and we,-that
are Christ's servants are commanded
to preach mercy at all times, in lite
name of Jesus Christ, to all those that
sincerely repent; so that it is never too
late io repent.'  
1 told Atkins all this* and lie heard
me with great earnestness; but'  it
seemed as "If he turned off the discourse
to the rest, for lie said to mt\ he would
go and have some talk with his-wife;
so he went out a while, »n4 we talked
to the rest* J perceived -they were alt
stupidly ignorant'as to matters of reli-
gion, as much as I was-when I weal
rambling away from my father; awl
yet there were none of tnem backward
to hear what had been said, and till ;#f'

ADVENTURES OF
 
 
' The 'clergyman smiled upon me
wttei I reported what answer they
fate, but said nothing a good while §
but at last shaking his" head, We that
tire Christ's servants, sap he, can go
no farther than to exhort and instruct;
and when men comply, 'submit to the
reproof, and promise What we ask,''tis
all we can do; we are bound to accept
their good words^ but, believe me, sir,
said life, whatever you may have known
of the life' of that man you call Will
Atkins, 1 believe he is the only- sincere
convert among them: I take that man
to be a true* penitent; I will not des-
pair of the rest; but that man is appa-
rently struck with the sense of his past
life, and 1 doubt not, 'when he conies
to talk of religion to his wife, he will
talk himself effectually info it; for at-
tempting to teach others is sometimes
the best way of teaching ourselves. 1
know a man, who, having nothing bul a
.summary notion of religion himself, and
being wicked and profligate to the last
degree in his life, made a thorough re-
formation in himself by labouring to
convert a Jew. If that poor Atkins
begins but once to talk seriously of Je-
sus Christ to his wife, my life for it, he
talks himself into a thorough eonvert,
makes himself a penitent, and who
 knows what may follow?
Upon this discourse, however, and
their promising, as above, to endeavour
to persiiade their wives to embrace
"Christianity, he married the other two
-crtuple; but Will Atkins and his  wife
were not yet come in. After this, my
'clergyman waiting awhile, was curious
to know where Atkins was gone; and
-'turning to me, said, I entreat you, sir,
iet lis walk out of your labyrinth here,
and look; 1 dare say we stiail find this
poor' rata tomewltere or other talking
-seriously to "his wife, 'and teaching her
already something of religion, I began
to be of the same mind 5 so we went
wut together* and 1 carried him a way
which none knew1  but myself, and
• where the trees were so very thick that
"it if is not easy to see through the
"thicket of leaves, and far harder to see
:1» than to'tee' but'} when coming to the
*el|e of tie wood, -I saw Atkins* and his
%'iHviiy #!fe sitting'Etider Ihe'stiade of a
bush, very eager in discourse: 1 stop-
ped short till my clergyman came- up
to' me, and then having showed'libi*
where they were, we stood and looked'
very steadily at them a good  while.
We observed him very earnest with
her, pointing up to the 'sun, and to
every quarter of the heavens, and then
down to the earth/ then out to the sea,
then to himself, 'then to her, to the
woods, to the trees. Now, says the
clergyman, you see my wordi 'are
made good, the man preaches to her;
mark liim now, he is telling her that
our God has made Mot and her, and
the heavens, the earth," the  sea, the
woods, the trees, &e.—I believe he' is«
said I. Immediately we perceived Will
Atkins start upon his feet, fall down'on
his knees, and lift up both his hands.
We supposed he said something, but
we could not hear him; it was too far
for that. He did not continue kneeling
half a minute, but comes and sits down
again by his wife, and talks to her
again;' we perceived then the woman
very attentive, but whether she said
any thing to him, we could not tell
While the poor fellow was upon his
knees, I could see the tears ran plenti-
fully down my clergyman's cheeks,
and I could hardly forbear myself; but
it was a great affliction to us'both that
we were not near enough to hear any
thing that passed between them* Well,
however, we could come no nearer, for
fear of disturbing them $ so we resolved
to see an end of this piece of still con-
versation, and it spoke loud enough to
us without the help of roice.  He sat
down again, as 1 have said, close by
her, and talked again earnestly to her,
and two or three times we" could see
him embrace her most passionately;
another time we saw him take out Ms
handkerchief and' wipe fher eyes, 'and
"then kiss her again, with'a"kind of
transport very'unusual; and after se-
veral of these things, we saw him &a a
sudden jump up again, "and lend' her
his hand to help her up, when imme-
diately leading her by the' hand a step
or^ two, they ;both kneeled - down toge-
ther, and continued so'about two'mi-
nutes. ' - • . '. •• ; .• '•

kins would-bear him, therefore 1 en-
treated bim to withhold himself awhile,
that we might see an end of the scene,
which to rac, 1 must confess, was the
must affecting that ever 1 saw in my
life. Well, lie strove with himself for
a while, but was in such raptures to
think that the poor heathen woman
was become a Christian, that he was
not able to contain himself; be wept
several times, then throwing up bis
hands and crossing his breast, said over
several thing's ejaculatory, and by way
of giving God thanks for so miraculous
a testimony of the success of our en-
deavours; some he spoke softly, and f
could not well hear others; some in
Latin, some in French} then two or
three times the tears would interrupt
bim, that be could not speak at all;
but 1 begged that lie would contain
himself, and let us more narrowly and
fully observe what was before us,
which lie did for a time, the scene not
being near ended yet; for after the
poor mail and his wife were risen again
from their knees, we observed he stood
talking still eagerly to her, and we ob-
served licr motion, that she was $r rcatiy
affected with what he said, by her fre-
quently lifting up her hands, laying
'her hand to her breast, and such otner
postures as express the greatest seri-
ousness and attention: this continued
about half a quarter of an hour, and
then they walked away; so we could
see no more of them in that situation,
•I took Ibis interval to talk with my
'clergyman'j and first, 1 was glad to
see tne particular* we bad both been
witnesses to, that, though 1 was hard
enough of belief in such cases, yet that
1 began to think it was all very sincere
here, both in the man and his wife,
however ignorant they might both be,
and 1 hoped such a beginning would
yet have a more happy end; And who
knows, said 1, but these two may in
time, by instruction and example, work
upon some of the others ?—Some .of
them! said he, turning quick upon me,
aye, upon all of them: depend upon it, if
those two savages, for he has been but
little better, as you relate it, should
embrace- Jesus Christ, they .willnever
fort* it till'irfy mmk upon all the rest;
 
for true religion is naturally communi-
cative* and he that is once made a Christ
tian will never leave a pagan -behind
him, if lie can help it. 1 owned it was a
most Christian principle to think so,
and a testimony of true zeal, as well m m
generous heart, in him. But, tuy friend,
said I, will you give me leave to atari
one difficulty here? 1 cannot tell how
to^ object the least thing against that
affectionate, concern which you <shqw
for the turning the poor people from
their paganism to the Christian reli-
gion: lint how does this comfort you,
while these people are, in your account*
out of the pule of the catholic church,
without which you believe there is no
salvation? so that you esteem these
but heretics, for other reasons as effec-
tual ly kwt as the Pagans themselves, .
To this he answered, with abundance
of candour, thus: Sir, 1 am a catholic
of the Roman church, and a priest of
the order of St. Benedict, and 1 em-
brace all the principles of the Roman
faith; but yet, if you will believe me,
and that 1 do not speak in compliment
to you, or in respect to my circum-
stances and your eivilifies; 1 sayt
nevertheless, I do not look upon you,
who .call yourselves reformed, without
some charity: 1 dare not say (though I
know it is our opinion in general) that
you cannot be saved; 1' will by no
means limit the mercy of Christ so far
as to think that he cap not receive you
into the bosom of bis church,  in a
manner to us unpereeivable; and I
hope you have the same charity fm m:
1 pray daily for your being ail restored
to Christ's church, by whatsoever me-
thod he, who is all-wise, is pleased .to
direct. In the mean time, sure yon
will allow it consists with me, as a Ra-
man, to distinguish far between a pro-
tectant and a pagan; between one that
calls on Jesus Christ, though in a -way
which I do not think is according to
the true faith, and a savage or;a. barba-
rian, that knows no God, no Cuifatyn*
Redeemer$ and if you are not. .within
the pale of the Catholic church, we
hope you are nearer being restored,to
It than those that know nothing ..of God
or of Lis church: and 1 rejoice,, there-

temper of this pious papist, as much
m  I was oppressed by the power of
his : reasoning; and it presently oc-
curred to niy thoughts, that if such n
temper was universal, we might be all
catholic Christians, whatever church

the fUymish church were blest with

of your opinion: but 1 must tell you,
that if you" should preach such doc-
trine. in Spain or Italy, they would put
you into the Inquisition.—It may be
so, said he < I know not what thev
would do in Spain or Italy; but 1 will
not Bay they would be the better
Christians for that severity; for I am
sure there is no heresy in abounding
with charity.
Well, as" Will Atkins and his wife
were gone, our business there was
over, so we went back our own way; t
and when we came back, ,we found
them wailing to be called in: observing-
this, I asked my clergyman if we
should discover to him that we had
seen him tinder the bush or not; unci
it was his opinion we should not, but
that we should talk to him first, and
hear what he would say tows; so we
called him in alone, nobody being in
the place but ourselves, and I began
with him thus:
Will Atkins, said I, prithee what
education had you? What was your
father?
W. A. A better man than ever i
shall be, Sir: my father was a clergy-
man.
R. C. What education did he give
yon?
W. A. He would have taught me
well, sir; but I despised all education,
instruction, or correction, like a beast
as I was.
B.C. It is true, Solomon says, He
that despises reproof is brutish,
W, A. Aye, sir, I was brutish in-
deed, for I murdered my father; for
God's sake, sir, talk no more about
that; sir, 1 murdered my poor father.
Pr. Ha! a murderer I
Here the priest started (for 1 inter-
preted every word as he spoke) and
looked pale: it seems he believed that
Will had really killed his father.
E. C. No, no, sir, 1 do not under-
stand him so: Will Atkins, explain
yourself; you did not killyour father,
did you, with your own hands?
\V. A, Mo, sir, 1 did not cut his
throat; hut I cut the thread of all
Mi comforts, and shortened his days;
I broke his heart by the most ungrate-
ful 'Unnatural return, for the most
tender and affectionate treatment that
father ever gave, or child ceuld receive,
 
 
 
 
 
m
 
E. C. Well, 1 did not ask you about
your father, to extort this confession:
1 pray I Hid give you repentance for It,
and forgive that an*! all your other
skis; hut I it-Let! you hecau.se 1 see
thai though yini have not much learn-
ing, yet you are not so ignorant as
some »ire lit things that are good;
that you have known more of re-
ligion, a givat deal, than you have
practised.
W. A. Though you, sir, did not
extent the confession that 1 make
about my father, conscience does;
and whenever we come to look back
upon our lives, the sins against our
indulgent parents are certainly * the
first that touch us; the wounds they
make lie deepest, and the weight they
leave will lie heaviest upon the mind,
of all the sins we can commit.
II. C. You talk too feelingly and
sensibly for me, Atkins j 1 cannot
hear it.
W. A. Ymi hear it, master! 1 dare
say you know nothing of it.
fl. C Yes, Atkins; every shore,
every hill, way, 1 may say every tree in
this island, h witness to tin4, anguish
of my soul for my ingratitude and had
usage of a good, tender father; a
father much like yours, by your de-
scription; and I murdered my father
as well as you. Will Atkins; but 1
think, for all that, my repentance is
short of vours too, by a great deal.
I would have said more, if I could
have restrained my passions; but 1
thought this poor man's repentance
was so much sineerer than mine, that
1 was going to leave off the discourse
and retire j for 1 was surprised with
what he had said, and thought that
instead of my going about to teach and
instinct him, the man was made a
teacher and iustrueter to me injei most
surprising and unexpected manner.
I laid all this before the young cler-
gyman, who was greatly affected with
it, and said to me, Did 1 not say, sir,
that when this man was converted he
, would preach to us all? I tell you, sk,
if this one man he made a true pe-
nitent, here .will lie no need of me-;
,114, .will < make Christians of all in the
island,—-Rut. hating a little composed
myself^ 1 renewed my dityconrac with
Will Atkias. But Will, said I, how
come* the sense of this matter to touch
you just cow?
W. A. $ii\ you have set me about n
work that has struck a dart through.
my very soul; 1 have been talking*
about Cod and religion to my ,wife» in
order, us yon diiectcd me, to make a
Christian of her, and she lias preached
such a sermon to me an 1. Khali never
forget while J live.
11, €, No, no, it is not your wife
lias preached to you; but when you
were moving religious arguments to
her, conscience has filing them back
upon you.
W. A. Aye, sir, with such force as
is not to be resisted.
It. CI Pray, Will, let us know what
passed between you and your wife 5
for I know something' of it already,
W. A. Sir, it is impossible to give
you a full account of it j 1 am too full
to hold it, and yet have no tongue to
express it; but let her have said what
she will, and though 1 cannot give you
an account of it, this I can tell yon,
that I bare resolved to amend and
reform my life.
II. (X But tell us some of it; how
did you begin,* Will? Fur this has
been an extraordinary case, that is
certain. She has preached a sermon,
intleedjif she has wrought this upon you.
W. A. Why, 1 first told her the
nature of our laws about marriage,
and what the reasons were, that men
and women were obliged to enter into
such compacts, as it was neither in the
power of one nor the oilier to break;
that otherwise, order and justice could
not be maintained, and men would run
from their wives, and abandon their
children, mix confusedly with- one.an-
other, and neither families he. kept
entire, nor inheritances be settled by
legal descent.
R. C. You talk like a civilian, Will.
.Could you make her understand what
you meant by inheritances-and fami-
lies? They know- .no such, things
among the savages, but many any
how, without regard to relation* con-
sanguinity, or family; brother and
sister, nay4 m I have'been, told, even
the father and the. daughter, and the
ion and the mother, .

•- W. A, J ..belief, sir, you are mid-
informed, awl my' wife assures me of
the contrary, and that they abhor it;
perhaps, for any farther relations,
thty .may not he*so exact as we are;
hut she tells me they never touch one
another in the near relationship you
speak of.
E. C. Well, what did she say to
what you told her?
W. A. She said she liked it very
well, and it was much better than in
her country.
R. 0. But did you tell her what mar-
riage was I
W. A. Aye»- aye; there began our
dialogue. I asked her if she would
be married to me our way. She asked
me what .way that was. 1 told her
marriage was appointed by God; and
here we had a strange talk together,
indeed, as ever man and wife had, I
believe.
M»B. This dialogue between Will At-
kins and his wife I took down in
. writing, just after he had told it me,
which"was as follows:
,: Wife. Appointed by your God!
Why,1 have you a God in your country?
W. A. Yes, my dear, God is in
et err country.
Wife. Mo your God in my country;
my country have the great old Bena-
jnuckee God.
• 'W. A. Child, 1 am very unlit to
show. you who God is; God is in
heaven, and made the heaven and the
earth, the sea, and all that in them is.
Wife. No uiakee de earth $ no you
'God ntakee all earth; no inakee my
country,
-Will Atkins laughed a little at her
expression of God not making her
country.
. ' Wife. No - laugh; why laugh me?
;This nothing to laugh. ^ ^ 
He was justly reproved by his wife,
lor, she was-- more «efious than he at first.
^cJV.<A. That'* true, itid#eci ;• 1'" will
ffoi:.ku^k any more* my dear. 
mWife;--Why, you say you God makee
all.:'
W. A; <Yes*-child, our God made
the *hote'world, and you and ine,' 'and
all things; for he is the only true God,
and there !»• no- God but him;  he
ires for ever in heaven.
Wife. Why, you no tell me long
ago, ''-
W. A. That's true, indeed; but 1
have been a wicked wretch, and'have
not only forgotten to acquaint thee
with auy thing before, but have
lived without God in the world mv-
self.
Wife. What have you 'a great God
in your country, you bo know him?
No say O to him} No do good thing
for him? That 110 possible?
W. A. It is true, though, for all
that; we live as if there was no God
in heaven* or that he had 110 power on
earth
Wife. But why God let you do so?
Why he no inakee you good live.
W. A. It is all our own fault.
Wife. But you say me he is great
much great, have much great power,
can inakee kill when he will, why he
no inakee kill when you no serve him i
No say O to Mm, no be good mans.
W. A. That is true, he might strike
me dead; and 1 ought to expect it,
for I have been a wicked wretch, that
is true; but God is merciful, and does
not deal with us as we deserve.
Wife. But then do you not tell
God thankee for that too?
W. A. No, indeed, 1 have not
thanked God for his mercy, any more
than I have feared God for his power.
Wife. Then you God no God; me
no think believe he be such one, great
much power, strong no makee kill
you, though you make him much
angry.
W, A. What will my wicked life
hinder you from believing in God?
What a dreadful creature am I! and
what a sad truth is it, that the horrid
lives of Christians hinder the conver-
sion of heathens!
Wife. How me think yon have
great much God' Up there, /shr p^irifs
up to heaven), and yet no, do well, no
do good thing! Can he.teit ? * Sure .tte
110 tell what you do? " :'" '" '.'*''''
W; A. Yes, ''yes, he' knows, /Htfl
gees all' things; he heart tis speak,
sees what we do,'knows what we think
though we do not speak.
Wife. What! he 110 hear yon .'cnrse*
swear, speak de great damn?' • '"'"'
; W. A. Yes, y#s, heart it all  «''
 
 
 
 
 
 
f»
 
Wife,. Where lie then the much
great power strong?
W. A. He is merciful, that is all
we can say for it} and this proves him
to be the true God > he is (»od» and
not mau, and therefore we are not
consumed*
liere Will Atkins told us he was
struck with horror, to think how he
could tell his wife so clearly that God
sees, and hears, and knows the secret
thoughts of the heart, aud all that we
do, and yet that he had dared to do
all the vile things he had done.
Wife. Merciful i What you call
that?
W. A. He is our father and maker,
and lie pities and spares u <.
Wife. So then he never makee kill,
©e?er angry when you do wicked;
then he no good himself, or no great
able.
W, A. Yes, yes, my dear, he is
infinitely good and infinitely great, and
able to punish too; and sometimes to
show his justice and vengeance, he lets
fly. his anger to destroy sinners and
make examples; many are cut off in
their sins,
.Wife. But no makee kill yon yet;
then he tell you, may be, that he no
makee yon kill; so you makee the
bargain with him, you do bad thing,
he *no be angry at you when he be
angry at other mans.
W. A, Ho, indeed, my sins are all
presumptions upon his goodness; and
tie would be infinitely just if he des-
troyed me, as he has done other men.
Wife. Well, and yet no kill, no
makee you dead; what you say to
him for that? You no tell him thankee
for all that too?
W. A. 1 am an unthankful, ungrate-
ful dog, that is true.
, .Wife, Why he no makee you much
good better? you say he makee you*
, ,, Wt A. He made me, as be made
a|l the; world: it is I have deformed
myself and abused his goodness, and
made, myself an abominable wretch.
".',,,Wife». I wish you makee God. know
^eiilno^ina.kee'him angry, 1 no'dp
tan wickeft thing,. ' .
,,Here..Will. 'Atkins .said his heart
sunk'within'.'.him/ to hear a.poorun-
taught creature, desire to be taught
to know God, find he such m wicked
wretch that he could not say one worf
to her about God, but what the re-
proach of his own .carriage would
make most irrational to her to believe?
nay, thai already she< had told him
that she could not .believe.'.:, in Godf
because he, that was so wicked, > was
not destroyed, 't
W, A. My dear, you mean, mm
wish I could teach yon to know uod,
not God to know you; for he knows yon
already and every thought in your heart.
Wife. Why then he know what 1
say to you now; he know me wish to
know him ; how shall me know who
makee me?
W. A. Poor creature, he must teaeli
thee, I cannot teaeli thee; I will pray
to him to teaeli thee to know him,
and forgive me, that am unworthy to
teach thee.
The poor fellow was hi such an agony
at her desiring him to make Iter know
God, and her wishing to know him,
that he said he fell down on his knees
before her, and prayed to God to en-
lighten her mind with the saving
knowledge of Jesus Christ, and  to
pardon his sins, and accept of his
being the unworthy instrument of in-
structing her in the principles of
religion; after which he sat down by
her again, and their dialogue went
on.—This was the time when we saw
him kneel down, and hold up Ms
hands.
Wife. What you put down the knee
for? What yon hold up the hand for?
What you say? Who yon speak to?
What is all that?
W. A, My dear, 1 bow my knees
in token of my submission to him that
made me; f said 0 to him, as yom
call it, and as your old men do' to
their idol Benamuckee; that is I prayed
to him*

,. I called Will • Atkins again, and
a*ked him; but the poor, fellow fell
immediately into tears, and told m he
had said something to her of ail those
things, but that "tie was himself so
wicked a creature, and Ills own con-
science so reproached him with his
horrid, ungodly life, that lie trembled
at the apprehensions tint her know-
ledge of him should lessen the
attention she should give to those
things, and make her rather contemn
religion than receive it; bat he was
assured, lie Maid, that her mind was
so disponed to receive due impressions
of all those things, and that if I would
but discourse with her, *>he would
wiake it appear to my satisfaction
that niy labour would not be lost upon
her.
Accordingly, 1 called her in, and
placing myself m interpreter between
my religious • priest and the woman,
1 entreated him to begin with her;
but sure such a sermon was never
preached by a popish priest in these
latter ages* of the world; and, as 1
told him, 1 thought he had all the
zeal, nil the knowledge, all the
sincerity of a Christian, without the
error of a Roman Catholic; and that
1 to:>k him to he such a clergyman
as the Roman bishops were, before
the church of Rome assumed spiritual
sovereignty over the consciences of
men. In a word, he brought the
poor woman to embrace the know-
ledge of Christ, and of redemption
by him, not with wonder and asto-
nishment only, as she did the first
notions of a God» but with joy and
faith; with an affection, and a sur-
prising degree of understanding, scarce
to be imagined;, much less to be ex-
pressed; and, at her own request, she
was baptised.
When he was preparing to baptise
hen I entreated him that he would
perform that office with some caution,
that the man might not perceive.'he
was, of the Roman Church, if possi-
ble, because of other ill consequen-
ces which might, attend a difference
among us in that very religion which
we .were instructing the other in. . lie
told me, that .as lie had no consecrated
chapel, nor proper things1' for the
office, I should see he would do it in
a manner that I should not know by
it thaUhe was a Roman Catholic my-
self, if I had not. known it before;
and so lie did; for saying only some
words over to himself in'Latin, which
1 could not understand, lis poured a
whole dishful of water upon the wo*
man's head, pronouncing in French
very loud, "Mary" (which was the
inline her husband desired me to give
her, for 1 was her godfather), "I Imp*
tise thee in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost;" so that none could know
any thing by it what religion he was
of. He "gave the benediction after-
wards in Latin, but either Will 'At-
kins did not knowlmt it was French,
or else did not take notice of it at
that time. 
As soon as this was over, we mar-
ried them; and after the marriage
was over, he turned to Will Atkins,
and in a very  affectionate mauner'ex-
horted him, not'only to persevere in
that good disposition he was in, but
to support the convictions that were
upon him by a resolution to reform
his life; told him it was in vain to
say lie. repented if he did not forsake
his crimes: represented to him how
God had honoured him with being
the instrument of bringing Ms wife
to the knowledge of the Christian re-
ligion, and that he should be careful
he did not dishonour the grace of
God; and that'if he did, he would
see the heathen a better Christian
than himself; the savage converted,

itself; and, secondly, that perhaps 1
would piil it' into a way of being
done in his absence to his satisfac-
tion; of which by and by.
Having thus brought the affaire of
ihe island to a narrow compass, 1 was
preparing; to go on board the ship,
when the young man ! bad taken
out of the famished ship's company
came to me, and told me he under-
stood I had a clergyman with me,
and that 1 had caused the English-
men to be married to tiie savages;
that he had a match, too, which he
desired might be finished before I
went, between two Christians, which
he hoped would not be disagreeable
to me.
1 knew this must be the young
woman who was his mother's servant,
for there was no other Christian
woman on the island: so 1 began to
persuade him not to do any thing of
that kind rashly, or because he found
himself in this* solitary circumstance.
1 represented to him that he had
some considerable substance in the
World, and good Mends, as 1 under-
stood by himself, and the maid also;
that the maid was not only poor, and
a servant, but was unequal to him,
-she being six or seven and twenty
years old; and he not above seventeen
or eighteen; that he might very pro-
bablyj with my assistance, make a
remove from this wilderness, and
"come into Ms own country again;
and that then it would be a thousand
to' one but he would repent his choice,
and the dislike of that circumstance
might. be disadvantageous to both.
1 was going to'say more, but he in-
terrupted, smiling, and told me, with
a great deal of modest?, that 1 inis-
• took in ' 'my guesses, that he had no-
thing" of that kind in his' thoughts;
aM 'he 'was very glad to hear that I
•'had an intent of putting them in a
way to sec their own country again$
and nothing should have put*him up-
on staying'there, but that the voyage 1
wits 'going was so exceeding long and
 hazardous, and would cany bini quite
out of the reach of all his friends;
that- he had nothing to desire of me,
""but that I would settle him In some
'little property in the island'where he
was, give him a servant or two, and
some few necessaries, and he would
settle himself here like a planter,
waiting the good lime when, if ever
I returned to England, ! would re-
deem them; and hoped 1 would not
be unmindful of him when 1 came
to England: that lie would give mo
some letters to Ids friends in Lon-
don, to let them know how good
I had been to him, and in what part
of the world, and what circumstances,
1 had left him in; and he promised
me that whenever I redeemed him,
the plantation and all the improve-
ments he had made upon it, let the
value be what it would, should lie
wholly mine.
His discourse was very prettily de-
livered, considering his youth, and
was the more agreeable to me, be-
cause he told me positively the match
was not for himself. I gave him all
possible assurance that if 1 lived to
come safe to England, 1 would deliver
his letters, and do his business effectu-
ally; and that be might depend I
should never forget; the circumstances
1 had left him in: but still 1 was im-
patient to know who was the person
to be married; upon which he told
me it was my Jaek-of-ail-trades and
his maid Susan. !was most agree-
ably surprised when he named the
match; for indeed I thought it very
suitable. The character of that man
'1 have given already; and as for the
maid, she was a very honest, modest,
sober, and religions young woman;
had a very good share of sense, was
agreeable enough in her person, spoke
very handsomely, and to the purpose,
always with decency and good man-
ners, and neither too backward to
speak, when requisite, nor imperti-
nently forward, when it was not her
business; very handy and housewifely,
and an excellent manager; fit, indeed,
to have been governess to the whole
island, and she knew very well how
to behave in every respect.
The match being proposed in this
manner, we married them the same
day; and as 1 was father at the altar,
as I may say, and gave her away, so
i gme her a portion» for I appointed
her and her husband a handaome

large space* of ground for their plan-
tation; and, indeed, this match, and
the proposal the young gentleman
made to give him u small property
in the island, put me upon parcelling
it out amount them, that they might
not quarrel afterwards about their si-
tuation.
This sharing out the land to thorn
1 left to Will Atkins, who was now
grown a sober, grave, managing fid-
low, perfectly reformed, exceedingly
plows and religions, and, as far an I
maybe allowed to speak positively in
siiefi a ease, !verily believe he was
a true penitent, lie divided thing*
so justly, and so iniieli to every one/a
satisfaction, that they only desired
one general writing under my hand
for the whole, which 1 caused to be
drawn up, and signed and sealed to
them, setting out the bounds and si-
tuation of every man's plantation,
and testifying that I gave them there-
by severally a right to the whole
possession and inheritance of the res-
pective plantations or farms, with
their improvements, to them and their
heirs, reserving all the rest of the
island as my own property, and a
certain rent for every particular plan-
tation after eleven years, if I, or any
one from me, or in my name, came
to demand it, producing an attested
copy of the same writing.
As to the government and laves
among them, I told them I was not
capable of giving them better rules
than they were able to give them-
selves; only 1 made them promise
me to live in love and good neighbour-
hood with one another; and so ! pre-
pared to leave them.
One thing I must not omit, and
that is, that being now settled in a
kind of commonwealth among them-
selves, and having much business in
hand, it was but odd to have seven
and thirty Indians live in a nook of
the island, independent, and, indeed,
unemployed; for, excepting the pro-
viding themselves food, which they
had difficulty enough to do, sometimes
they had no manner of business or
property to manage. 1 proposed,
therefore, to the governor Spaniard,
that he should go to them, with Fri-
day's father, and propose to them to
remove, and either plant for then-
selves, or take them into - their several
families as servants, to be maintained
for their labour, but without being
absolute slaves; for I would not ad-
mit them to make them slaves by
force, by any means; because they
had their liberty given them by capitu-
lation, as it were articles of surrender,
which they ought not to break.
They most willingly embraced the
proposal, and came all very cheerful
along with hi in: so we allotted them
land, and plantations, which three or
four accepted of, but all the rest
chose to be employed as servants in
the several families we had settled;
and thus my colony was in a manner
settled, as 'follows:—The Spaniard*
possessed my original habitation,
which was the capital eitv, and ex-
tended their plantations all along the
side of the brook, which made the
creek that 1 have so often described,
as far asm? bower; and as they in-
creased their culture, it went always
eastward. The English lived In the
north-east part, where Will Atkins and
his comrades began, and came on
southward and south-west, towardf
the back part of the Spaniards; and
every plantation had a great addition
of land to take in, if they found occa-
sion, so that they need not jostle one
another for want of room. All the
east end of the island was left unin-
habited, that if any of the savages
should tome on shore there only for
their usual customary barbarities, they
might come and go; if they disturbed
nobody, nobody would disturb them:,
and no doubt but they were 'often'
ashore, and went away again, for 1
never heard that the planters were
ever attacked or disturbed any more*
It now came into my thoughts that
I had hinted to niy friend the clergy-
man that the work of converting
the savages might perhaps be set on
foot in hi3 absence to his satisfaction,
and told him that now 1 thought it
was nut in a fair way; for the sava-
ges oeing thus divided among the
Christians, if they would but every
one of them do their part with those
which came under their hands, I

lie agreed presently in thut, if iticy
did their part. Bui how, says he,
shall we obtain that of tliein ? *! told
him we would call tliein all together,
and leave it iii charge with tliein, or
go to them, one by one, which he
thought best: so we divided it, he to
speak to the Spaniards, who were
all papists, and 1 to the .English, who
were all protectants; and we recom-
mended it earnestly to them, and
made them promise that they would
never make any distinction of papist
or protestant in their exhorting the
savages to turn Christians, hut to
teach them the general knowledge of
the true God, and of their Saviour
Jesus Christ: and they likewise pro-
mised ns that they would never have
any differences or disputes one with
another about religion.
When !came to Will Atkins's honse
(1 may call it so, for such a house,
or such a piece of basket work, I be-
lieve, was not standing in the world
again), there ! found the young wo-
man I have mentioned above, and Will
Atkins's wife were become intimates;
and this prudent, religions young' wo-
man, hail perfected1' the work Will
Atkins had begun; and though it was
not above four" clays after what I have
related, • yet the new-baptised savage
woman was made such a Christian
as 1 have seldom heard of in all my
observation and conversation in the
world.
It came next into my mind, in the
morning before 1 went to them, that
amongst ail the needful things 1 had
to leave with them, 1 had not left them
a Bible, in which I showed myself less
considering for tliein than my good
friend the' widow was for me, when
she sent me the cargo of a hundred
pounds from Lisbon, where she pack-
ed up, three Bibles and a prayer-book.
However, the good woman's charity
had 'ft greater extent than ever she
imagined, for they were reserved for
the comfort and instruction of those
that made much better use of them
than' Iliad done.
T-took one of the Bibles in my
pocket, <and when 'I came to Will
Atkins's tent, or house, and found tin?
young woman and Atkins's baptised
wife had been discoursing of religion
together, for Will Atkins told it"me
with a great deal of joy, I asked if they
were together now, and lie said yes; so
I went into the house, and lie with me,
and we found them together very ear-
nest in discourse. (), sir, says* Will
Atkins, when God has sinners to recon-
cile to himself, and aliens to bring
home, he never wants a messenger;
my wife has got anew instructor; 1
knew I was as unworthy as I was inca-
pable of that work; that young woman
lias been sent hither frori heaven • she
is enough to convert a whole island of
savages. The young woman blushed,
and rose up to go away, but 1 desired
her to sit still$ 1 told* her she had a
good work upon her hands, and 1
hoped God would bless Iter in it.
We talked a little, and I did not per-
ceive they had any book among them,
though I did not esk, but 1 put my
hand into my pocket, and pulled out
my Bible; Mere, says I to Atkins, I
have brought you an assistant that per-
haps you had not before. Hie man
\vm so confounded that he was not
able to speak for some time; but re-
covering himself, he takes it; with both
his hand?, and turning to his wife,
Here, my dear, says he, did not I tell
yon our God, though he lives above,
.could hear what we said? Here's the
book I prayed for when you and 1
kneeled down under the hush; now
God has heard us, and sent it. When
he had said so, the man fell into such
transports of passionate joy, that be-
tween the joy of having it, "and giving
God thanks for it, the tears ran clowii
his face like a child that was crying.
The woman was surprised, and was
like to have run into a mistake that
none of us were aware of, for she irmly
believed God had sent the book upon
her husband's petition. It is true, that
providentially it was so, and might be
taken so in a consequent sense; but 1
believe it would have been no difficult
matter, at that time, to have persuaded
the poor woman to have believed that
an express messenger earoe from tea*
veo on purpose to bring that individual
book; but it was too serious a matter

her we did nut desire to impose upon
the new convert, in iw,»r first untl more
ignorant understanding of things, ami
begged her to explain to her (hut (Jed

we petitioned for; but we (lid not ex-
pert returns from Heaven in a inlraeti-
Ion.-; ami particular manner, ami it U

This the young woman did after-
wards effectually, .so that there was, .1
assure you, no priestcraft used here;
ami I should have thought it one of
the most unjustifiable frauds iu the
world to hare had it so. But the sur-
prise of joy upon Will Atkins k really
not to lie expressed; uud there, we
way be sure, was no delusion. »Sure
no man was ever more thankful in the
world for any tiling* of its kind than he
was for the Hible; nor, i believe, never
any man was glad of a Bible from a
better principle; and though he had
been a most profligate creature, head-
strong, furious, and desperately wicked,
yet thics iiiciu in a standing rule to us all
for the well instructing children, viz.
Chat parents should never give over to
teach mid instruct, nor ever despair of
fie success of their endeavours, let the
mildren be ever ho refractory, or, to
appearance, insensible of Instruction;
for, M ever Cod, hi his proud?nce
touehes the conscience of such, the
force of their education returns upon
them, ami the early instruction of pa-
rents is not lost, though it may have been
many years laid asleep, bttt/sotiie time
or other, they may find the benefit of
it. Thus it was with this poor man,
however ignorant lie was- of religion
and Christian knowledge, he found he
had some to do with now more igno-
rant than himself, and that the least
part of the instruction of his good fa-
ther that now came to his mind was of
use to him.
Among the rest it occurred to him,
he said, "Sow his father used to insist so
much on the inexpressible value of the
Bibh% the privilege and blessing of it
to iMitkiite, familievaiKl persons; but
lie iierer entertained the least notion of
the worth of it till now, when being to
talk to heathens, *avage«, and barba-
rian^, he wanted the help of the written
oraele for Ids assistance.
The young woman was glad of it
aUo for the present occasion, though
she had one, and so had the youth, on
hoard our ship, among their good?,
which were not yet brought on shore.
And now having said so many filings
of litis voting uomi'U, I eanuot omit
felling one story mor<» of her and my
self, which has something in it very in-
forming and remarkable.
I have related to what extremity the
poor young woman, was reduced, how
her mistress was starved to death, and
died on board that unhappy ahip we met
at sea, and how the whole ship's com-
pany was reduced to the last extremity.
The gentkwoman and her son, and this
maid, were first hardly used, m toprovi-*
sions, and at last totally neglected ami
starved; that, is to say,bnmght to the last
extremity of hunger.—-One day, being
discoursing with heron the extremities
1 hey suilered, 1 asked Iter if she could
describe, by what she bad felt, what it
was to .starve, and how it appeared?
She told me she believed she could,
and r)io told her tale very distinctly,
thus:
First, sir, said she, we had for some
days fared exceeding hard, ami suffered
very great hunger: but at last we were
wholly without food of tiny kind, ex*
cept sugar, and a little wine and water.
The first day, after J had received no
food at all, I found myself, towards even-
ing, first empty and sick at the sto-
mach, and nearer night much inclined
to yawning and sleep. I laid down on
a couch in the great cabin to dm*p$ and
slept about three hours, and awaked a
little refreshed, having taken a glass of
wine when 1 lay down; after being about
three hours awake, it being about five
o'clock in the morning, 1 found myself
empty, apd my stomach sickish, and lay
down again, bur could not sleep at all*
being very faint and ill; and thus f conti-,
juted all the .second day,whh a strange va-
riety, first hungry, then sick again, with
Teachings to vomit The second night* .
being obliged to go to bed agaig with"
out any food, more than a draught, of:
 
 
ADVENTURES OF
 
fresh water, and being asleep, I dreamed
1: wis at Barbadoes, and* that the mar-
ket was mightily stocked with provi-
sions 5 that I bought some for my mis-
tress, and went and dined very heartily.
1 thought' my stomach was as full after
this as"it would have been after a good
dinner; hut when I awaked, 1 was ex-
ceedingly sunk in my spirits to find my-
self in the extremity of famine. The
last glass of wine we had rdrank, and
put sugar in it, because of its having
sOnie spirit to supply nourishment;
but there being no substance in the
stomach for the digesting office to work
upon, 1 found the only effect of the
wine was, to raise disagreeable funics
frotn the stomach into the head; and I
lay, as they told me, stupid and sense-
less, as one drunk, for some time.
The third clay, in the morning, after a
night of strange, confused, and incon-
sistent dreams, and rather dozing than
sleeping, 1 awaked ravenous and furi-
ous with hunger; and 1 question, had
not my understanding returned and
conquered it, whether, if I had been'a
mother, and had had a little child with
me, its life would have been safe or
not. This lasted about three hours;
during which time I was twice raging
mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my
young master told me, and as he can
now inform you.
In one of these fits of lunacy or dis-
traction 1 fell clown, and struck my
face against the corner of a pallet bed,
in which my mistress lay, and, with
the blow, the blood gushed out of my
nose; and the cabin-boy bringing me *a
little basin, 1 sat down'and bled'into it
A great deal; and as the blood came
from me, I came to myself, and the
violence of the flame or fe?er I was in
abated, ^and so did the ravenous part of
the hunger. Then 1 grew sick, and
reached to vomit, but could not, for I
had nothing in my stomach to bring
tip. After'! had "bled some time,!
swooned, and they all believed I was
dead; hot I came to myself soon after*
find then had a most dreadful pain in
my stomach, not to be described, not
like'the cholic, 'but a knawing, eager
putt for £#od; and towards the" night it
went'off, with a kind of earnest wishing
#t longing for food, something like, a$
1 suppose, the longing of a woman
with child. 1 took another draught of
water, with sugar in it; but my stomach
loathed the sugar, and brought it all up
again: then 1 took a draught of water
without sugar, and that staid with me j
and 1 laid me down upon the bed, pray-
ing'most heartily that it would please
God to take me away; and composing
my mind in hopes of it, I slumbered
awhile, and then waking, thought my-
self living, being light with vapours
from an empty stomach; 1 recom-
mended my soul then to God, and ear-
nestly wished that somebody would
throw ine into the sea.
All this while my mistress lay by me,
just, as 1 thought, expiring, but bore it
with much more patience than I; gave
the last bit of bread she had left to"her
child, my young master, who would
not have taken it, but she obliged hint
to eat it; and I believe it saved his life.
Towards die morning 1 slept again;
and when I awoke, 1 fell into a violent
passion of crying, and after that had a
second fit of violent; hunger: I got up
ravenous, and in a most dreadful condi-
tion: had my mistress been dead, as
much as 1 loved her, I am certain I
should have eaten a piece of her flesh
with as much relish, and as uncon-
cerned, as ever J did eat the flesh of
any creature appointed for food; and
once or twice I was going to bite rny
own arm: at last 1 saw "the basin in
which was the blood 1 had bled at my
nose the clay before; 1 ran to it, and
swallowed it with such haste, and such
a greedy appetite, as if I wondered no-
body had taken it before, and afraid it
should be taken from me now. After
it was down, though the thoughts of it
filled me with horror, yet it checked
the it of hunger, and I took another
draught of water, and was composed
and refreshed for some hours after.
This was the fourth day; and thus!
held if till towards night j when, within
the compass of three hours, 1 hid all
the several circumstances over again,
one after another, viz. sick, sleepv,
eagerly hungry, pain in the stomacn,
then ravenous again'; then sick, then
lunatic, then crying, then ravenous
again, and so every quarter of an hour;
tad my strength wasted exceedingly *
231
H night 1 laid ine down, having no
comfort but in the hope that .1 should
die before morning. k
All this night I had in'* sleep; hut
the hunger was now turned into a dis-
ease; and 1 hud a terrible eholie and
griping, by wind, instead of food, having
found its way into the bowels; and in
this condition I lay till morning, when
1 was surprised with the cries ami la-
mentations of my youiiir master, who
called out to me that his mother was
dead; 1 lifted myself up a little, fori
hud not strength to rise, but found she.
was not dead, though she was able to
give very little sijrns of life.
I had then such convulsions in my
stomach, (<ir want of some sustenance,
that I cannot describe; with such fre-
quent throes and puntrs of appetite, that
nothing but the torture* of death can
imitate; and in this condition f was
when 1 heard the seamen above cry
out, A sail 1 a sail! and hoilo and jump
about as if they were* distracted,
I was not able to tfet off from the
bed, and my mistress much less; and
my younjr master was so nick, that I
thought lie had been expiring; so we
could not open the cabin door, or get
any account what it was that occasioned
such confusion; nor had we any con-
versation with the ship's company for
two days, they having told m ttiut they
had not a mouthful of any thing to eat
in the .ship; and this they told us after-
ward:?, they thought we had been dead.
It was this dreadful condition we were
in when you were sent to save our lives;
and how you found us, sir, you know as
well as J, and better too.
This was her own relation, and is
such a distinct account of starving to
death, as, J confess, I never met with,
and was exceeding1 entertaining to me.
I am the rather apt to believe it to be a
true account, because the youth gave
me an account of si good part; though,
1 must own, not so distinct and so feel-
ing* as the maid} and the rather, be-
cause it seems his mother fed him at
the price of her own life; but the poor
maid, though her constitution being
stronger than that of her mistress* who
was in years, and a weakly woman too,
she might struggle harder, with it; I
say, the poor maid might be supposed
to feel the extremity sometumg sooner
than her mistress, who might he-al-
lowed to keep the last bit something*
longer than she parted with any to, re-
lieve the maid. No question, m the
case is here relate^ if our .ship, or
some other, had not so providentially
met them, a few days more would have
ended all their live*;, unless they had
prevented it by eating one another;
and that even, its their ease stood,
would have served them but a little
while, they being five hundred leagues
from any land, or any possibility of
relief, other than in the miraculous
manner it, happened: but this is by the
way; I return to my disposition of
thiiurs among* the people.
And, first, it is to be observed here,
that for many reasons J did not think
lit to let them know any thing of the
sloop i had framed, and which I thought
of selling up amon^ them; for J found,
at least at my first cominir, such seeds
of divisions among* them* that I saw
plainly had J set up the sloop, and left
it among them, they would, upon every
Jhrht disgust, have separated, and gone
away from one another, or perhaps have
turned pirates, and so made the island
a den of thieves, instead of a plantation
of sober and religious people, m 1 In-
tended it: nor did 1 leave the two
pieces of brass cauuoii that I had on
board, or the two quarter-deck guns
that my nephew took extraordinary,
for the same reason: f thought it,was
enough to qualify them for u defensive
war against any that should invade
them, but not to set them up (or an
oflensive war, or to go abroad, to attack
others; which, in the end, would only
bring ruin and destruction upon them:
I reserved the sloop, therefore, and the
£uns, for their service another way, as
I shall observe in .its place.
Having now done with the island, 1
left tbem all in good circumstances and
in a flourishing condition, and. went on
board my ship again the 6th of May,
having been about twenty-five days
among them $ and as they were fdl re-
solved to stay upon the island till I
came to,remove them, 1 promised' to
send them farther relief from the Bra-
zil!» if J could possibly find an. oppor-
tunity: and,, particularly, 1- promised

to, rpen4 thrift some cattle, such as
stop, hogs, and cows; as to th« two
cows and calves which 1 brought from
England, we had been obliged, by the
length of our voyage, to kill them at
sea,' for want of hay to feed them. .
The next day, giving them a salute
of five guns at parting,'we set sail, and
arrived at the bay of All Saints, in the
Brazils, in about twenty-two days, meet-
ing nothing remarkable in our passage
but this: that about three clays after
we had sailed, being becalmed, and the
current,setting strong to the E. N. E.
running, as it were, into a bay or gulf
011 the land side, we were driven some-
thing out of our course, and once or
twice our men cried o\tt» Land to the
eastward; but whether it was the con-
tinent or islands we could not teli by
any means, But the third day, towards
evening, the sea smooth* and the wea-
ther culm, we saw the sea, as it were,
covered towards the land with some-
thing very black; not being able to dis-
cover what it was, till after some time,
our chief mate going up the inain-
«hfoti|k a little way/ and looting at
them with a perspective, cried out it
was an army. 1 could not imagine
what he meant by an army, and thwarted
hfiji a little hastily. Nay, sir, says he,
don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a
fleet too j fori believe there are a thou-
sand canoes, and you may sec them
paddle along, for they are coining
towards us apace,
1 was a little surprised then, indeed,
and so was inv nephew the captain; for
he had heard such terrible stories of
them in the island, and having never been
in those,seas before, that he could net
tell what to think of, it, but said, two or
three times, we should ail be devoured.
I must .co&fess, considering we were
becalmed, and the current set strong
towards the shore, 1 liked it the worse;
however,, 1 bade them not be afraid,
but bring the ship to an anchor as soon
as ,we came so near-to know that we
inust engage them..
,','The 'weather continued calm, and
fhev.caoie on apace towards us; sol gave
order, to. cope to an .anchor, and furl
all our sails: as for the savages, 1 told
them they-had nothing to fear bat Ire,
aact therefore, they. should get their
boats out, and fasten them, one close*
by the head, and the other by the stern,
and man them both well, and wait the
issue in that posture: this 1 did, that
the men in the boats might be ready
with sheets and buckets to put out any
fire these savages would endeavour to
fix to the outside of the ship.
In tliis posture we lay by for them,.
and in a little while they came up with
its; but never was such a horrid sight
seen by Christians: though my mate
was much mistaken in his calculation
of their number, yet when they came
up we reckoned about a hundred and
twenty-six; some of them had sixteen
or seventeen men in them, and some
more, and the least six or seven.
When they came nearer-to us, they
seemed to be struck with wonder and
astonishment, as • at a sight which
doubtless they had never seen before;
nor could they, at first, as we after-
wards understood, know what to make
of us; they came boldly up, however,
very near *to us, and seemed to go
about to row round us; but we called
to our men in the boats not to let them
come too near them. This very order
brought us to an engagement with
them, without our designing it; for
five or six of the large canoes came so
near our long-boat"' that our men
beckoned with their hands to keep them
back, which they understood very well,
and went back, but at their retreat
about fifty arrows came on board us
from those boats, and one of our men in
the long-boat was very much wounded.
However, 1 called to them not to fire by
any means; but we handed down some
deal-boards into the boat, and the car-
penter presently set up a kind offence,
like waste-boards, to cover them from
the arrows of the savages, if they
should shoot again.
About half an hour afterwards they
all came up in a1 body astern of us, and
so near, as that we could easily discern
what they were, though we could not tell
their design; and 1 easily found they
were some of my old friends, the same
sort of savages that I had been used to
engage with; and in a short time more
they rowed a little farther out to sea,
till they came directly broadside -with
us,, and* then rowed, down straight upon
 
 
2;t,l
 
us till they came m near that tin*?
eouk? hear ih speak: upon this I or-
dered all my men too keep rlo*(% lest
they should shoot any more arrow.*,
arid made all our guns ready; hut ho*
iug so near its to he within bearing, 1
made Friday go out upon tin4 deck, v.tul
call out aloud lo them in his language,
lo know wiv.t they meant i which ac-
cordingly h'» did. Whether they un-
derstood him or not, that 1 knew not;
but as soon rw he had ended to them,
.si>: of them, who were in the foremost
or mgh^st boat to us, turned their
e-mne* from us, and stooping down,
shewed ?h their naked backsides, just
us if, in Fnglish, saving your presence,
they hud hid us kiss —-: whether
this \\<m a defiance or challenge we
knew not, or whether it was done In
fiict*'* contempt, or as a signal to the
rest; hut immediately Friday cried out
they were g«iitig to shoot, and, un-
happily for him, poor fellow, they
lei fly about three hundred of their
arrows, and* to my inexpressible grief,
killed poor Friday, no other mmi being
in their sight. The poor fellow w,m
shot with no less than three arrows,
and about three, more fell very near
him; Mich unlucky marksmen they
were
re!
I was s<:
I fflHfV
enraged at the hm of my
servant niit.I companion,
thai ! immediately ordered live guns to
be loaded with small-shot, and four
with great, ami gave them such a
broadside m they had never heard in
their lives, before, to be sure, They
were, not above half a cable length off
when we fired; and our gunners took
their aim so well that three or four
of their canoes were overset, as we
had reason to believe, by one shot
only.
The ill manners of turning up their
bare backside* to us gave lis no great
offence; neither did 1 know for certain
whether that which would puss for
the greatest contempt among us might
be understood so by them or not;
therefore, in return, 1 had only resolved
to litre ired four or five guns at them
with powder only, which 1 knew
would frighten them sufficiently; but
when they 'shot at us directly, with all
the fury the?' were capable of, and
especially m they had killed my poor
Friday, whom f m entirely loved and
valued, and who, Indeed, an well de-
served If,, I thought mys'df not only
justifiable before (tod and man, bill:
won 1:1 have been very glad if I could
have overset every canoe there, utkd
drowned every one of them.
I easi neither tell how many we
killed, nor how many we wounded, at
'this broadside, but sure such a fright
and hurry never was seen among swell
a multitude; there were thirteen or
fourteen of their canoes split and over-
set in all, and the men all set a-swim-
iiiing: the rest, frightened out of their
wits, scoured away as fast as they
could, taking but 'little rare to wive
those whose boats were split or spoiled
with our shot; so I suppose, that many
of them were lost; and our men took
up one. poor fellow swimming for his
life, above an hour after they were all
gone.
The small-shot from our cannon
must needs kill and wound a great
many; but, in short* we never knew
any thing how it went with them,'
for they fled so iimt, (hut m three
hours, or thereabouts, we could not
.sec above three or four straggling
e.mocs, nor did we* ever .see the* rest;
any more; for a breeze of wind spring-
ing up the same evening, we weighed,
and set sail for the Bnr/ils.
We had a prisoner, indeed, but the
creature was so sullen that he would
neither eat nor speak, and we all
fancied he would starve himself to
death: but f took a way to cure him;
for I made them take him and turn
him into the long-boat, and make hint
believe they would tons hi in into the
sea again, and so leave hiin where
they found him, if lie would not speak;
nor* would that do, hut they really'did
throw hlrn into the sea., and came away
from him; and then he followed them,
for he swam like a cork, and called to
them, in his tongue, though they knew
not one word of what he said: fiCHf-
ever, it last they took Mm in again,
and, then be began to be more tract-
aide; nor did 1 ever design they'should
drown hini. '' ' ,"!
We were now under sail again; lilt

ADVKNTURliS OF
alive for want of my man Friday, and
would have been very glad to have
gone back to the island to have taken
one of the rest from thence for my
occasion; but it could not be; so we
went on. We had one prisoner, as 1
have said, and it was a long time be-
fore we could make him understand
any thing; but, in time, our men
taught him some English, and lie be-
gan to be a little tractable. \ftcr-
Wards> \vc inquired what conn try he
came from, but could make nothing of
what he said; for his speech was so
odd, ail gutterals, and he spoke in the
throat in such a hollow, odd manner,
that we could never form a word after
him; and we were all of opinion that
they might speak that language as
well if they were gagged m otherwise;
nor could we perceive that they had
any occasion either for teeth, tongue,
lips, or palate, but formed their words
just as a hunting-horn forms a tune,
with an open throat. He told us,
however, some time after, when we
had taught him to speak a little
English/ that they were going with
their kings to tight a great battle.
When lie" said kings, we asked him
how many kings? He said they were
five nation, (we could not make him
understand the plural #), and that
they ail joined to go against two na-
tion. We asked him what made them
come up to us? He said, "To inakee
te great wonder look." Here it-is to
be observed, that all those natives, as
also those of Africa, when they learn
English, always add two e's at the end
of "the words where we use one; and
they place the accent upon them, as
inakee, takee, and the like; and we
could not break them of it; nay, I
could hardly make Friday leave it off,
though at last he did.
And now 1 name the poor fellow
once more, I must take my last leave
of Wm: Poor honest Friday! We
buried him with all the decency and
solemnity possible,, by putting him
into-a coffin, and throwing him into the
sea; and 1 caused them to fire eleven
guns for him:. and so ended • the life
of the most grateful, faithful, honest,
 and most affectionate servant, that
ever, man had.
We went now away with a fair wind
for Brazil; and in about twelve day?*
time we made laud, in the latitude of
five degrees south of the line, being
the north-eastermost land of all that
of America. We kept on S. by E, in
sight of the shore four days, when we
made (Jape St. Augustine, and in three
days came to an anchor oil* the bay of
All Saints, the old place of my de-
liverance, from whence came both my
good and evil fate.
Never ship came to this port that
had less business than I had, and yet
it was with great difficulty that we
were admitted to hold the least cor-
respondence on shore: not my partner
himself, who was alive, and made a
great figure among them, not my two
merchant-trustees, not the fame of
my wonderful preservation in the
island, could obtain me that favour;
but my partner remembering that 1
had given five hundred moidores to
the prior of the monastery of the Au-
gustines,and two hundred and seventy-
two to the poor, went to the monastery,
and obliged the prior that then was, to
go to the governor, and get leave for
me personally, with the captain and
one more, besides eight seamen, to
come on shore, and no more; and
this upon condition absolutely capi-
tulated for, that we should not offer to
land any goods out of the ship, or to
carry any person away without licence.
They were so strict with us as to
landing any goods, that it was with
extreme difficulty that 1 got on shore
three bales of English goods, such as
fine broad-cloths, stuffs, and some
linen, which 1 had brought for a pre-
sent to my partner.
He was a very generous, open-
hearted man; though, like me, he
came from little at first: and though
he knew not that 1 had the least de-
sign of giving him any thing, he sent
me on board a present of fresh pro-
visions, wine, awl sweetmeats, worth
above thirty moidores, including some
tobacco, and tlirec or four line medals
of gold; but 1 was even with him in
my present, which, as I have said,
consisted of fine broad-cloth, English
stuffs, lace, and fine hollands; also 1
delivered him about the value of one
 
 
ROBINSON <;!ll>OI«.
2M
hundred pounds sterling, In the same
goods, for v>ther uses; and I obliged
Iiiiii to set. tip tli** sloop, which I had
brought with me from England, as f
have sal* 1, for the use of my colony, in
order to scant ilic refreshments J In-
tended to my plantation.
Accordingly he gut hand:*, and
CmMied the tdoop in a very few days,
for site was already framed; and I.
gave the master of lier audi instruc-
tions as that lie could not miss the
place; nor did he miss them, as 1 had
«n account from my partner after-
wards. I got him soon loaded with
the small cargo 1 scut litem; ami one
of our seamen, that had been on shore
with mc there, ottered to go with the
sloop and settle there, upon my letter
to the governor Spaniard to allot him
a suflicient quantity of land for a plan-
tation, and giving him some clothes
and tools for hia piautiug work, which
lie said lie understood, having been an
old planter at Maryland, and a buc-
caneer into the bargain. 1 encouraged
the fellow, hy granting all he desired;
and, as in condition, f gave him the
savage whom we had taken prisoner
of war to he hw slave, and ordered
the governor Spaniard to give hint ids
share of every thing he wanted with
the rest.
When we came to fit this man out,
my old partner told me there was a
certain very honest fellow, a Brazil
planter of his acquaintance, who had
fallen into the displeasure of the
church. 1 know not what the matter
is with him, fays he, hut on my con-
science I think lie is it heretic In his
heart, and he has been obliged to con-
ceal himself for fear of the Inquisition;
that he -would lie very glad of such
an opportunity to make' his escape,
with his wife and two daughters; and
if I would let them go to my island,
and allot them a plantation, lie would
give them a small stock to begin with;
for the officers of the Inquisition had
seized all his effects and estate, and he
had nothing left hut a little house-
hold stuff, and two slaves: and, adds
he, though 1 hate his principles, yet I
would not have him fall into their
hand*, for he will be assuredly burned
*!?>*? if lie cb#.
I grunted thw presently, ami joined
my Englishman with litem f and we
concealed the man, and his wife ami
daughters, on hoard our ship, fill the
sloop put out to go to sea; and then
having put all their goods on hoard
some'time before, we put them tin
hoard the sloop after she was got out
of the hay.
Our seaman was mightily pleased
with tliis* new partner; and their
stocks, indeed, were much alike rich
hi tools, in preparation, ami u farm;
but nothing in begin with, except as
above: however, they carried over
with them, which was worth all the
rest, some materials for planting sugar-
canes, with some plants of canes,
which he, 1 mean the Portugal man,
understood very well.
Among the rest, of the supplies sent
to my tenants in the island, 1 sent
them hy the sloop three milch cows
and five calves, about twenty-two hogs
among them, three sows big with pig,
two mares, and a stone-horse. For
my Spaniards, according to my pro-
mise, I engaged three Portugal women
to go, and recommended it to them
to marry them, and use them kindly.
1 con Id have procured more women,
but I remembered that the poor pro-
secuted man had two daughters, and
that there were but five of the
Spaniards that wanted; the rest had
wives of their own, though in another
eotin try.
All this cargo arrived safe, arid, as
you may easily suppose, was very wel-
come to my old inhabitants, who were
now, with this addition, between sixty
and seventy people, besides little
children, of* which there were a great
many. I found letters at London
from the in all, by way of Lisbon*
when I came hack to England, of
which I shall also take some notice
immediately.
1 have now done with the island
and all maimer of discourse about it;
and whoever reads the rest of my me-
morandums would do well to turn bis
thoughts entirely from it, and expect
to read of-the follies of iwi old-man,
not warned by his own harms, mtich
less by those of other men, to bew«re
of the like j not cooled by almost
 
 
ADVENTURES OF
fortj years' miseries and disappoint-
ments; not satisfied with prosperity
beyond expectation, nor made cautious
by atilictious and distress beyond imi-
tation.
I bad ho more business to go to the
Kast lollies than a man at full liberty
Juts to «<> to the turnkey at Newgate,
and desire him to lock hiin up among"
the prisoners there, and starve him.
Had ! taken a small vessel from Eng-
land, and gone directly to the island;
had 1 loaded her, as 1 did the other
vessel, with,all the necessaries fur the
plantation, and for my people; taken
a patent from the government here to
have secured my property, in sub-
jection only to that of England; had
I carried over cannon and ammunition,
servants, and people to plant, and
taken possession of the place, fortified
and strengthened it in the name of
England, and increased it with people,
m I might easily have done; had I
then settled myself there, and sent
the ship back laden with good rice, as
1 might also have done in six months'
time, and ordered my friends to have
fitted her out again for our supply;
had 1 done this, and staid there my-
self, 1 had at least acted like a man of
common sense: but I was possessed
with a wandering spirit, and scorned
all advantages, and pleased myself with
being the patron of the people 1 placed
there, and doing for them in a kind
of haughty, majestic way, like an
old patriarchal monarch, providing for
them as if 1 had been father of the
whole family, as well as of the plan-
tation; but I never so much as pre-
tended to 'plant in the name of any
government or nation, or to acknow-
ledge any prince, or to call my people
subjects to any one nation more than
another: nay, I never so much as
gave the place a name, but left it, as
J found it, belonging to nobody, and
the people under no discipline or go-
vernment but my own; who, though
I had, influence over them as a, father
and benefactor, had no authority or
power to act or command one way
or other, farther than voluntary con-
seat moved them to comply: yet even
this, had I staid there, would have
done well enough; but as 1 rambled
from them, and came there no more.,
the last letters I had from any of them
were by my partner's* means, who
afterwards sent another sloop to the
place, and who sent me word, though
I had not the letter till I got to
London, several years after it was
written, that they went on lint poorly,1
were malcontent with their long stay
there; that Will Atkins was dead;
that live of the Spaniards were come
away; and though they had not been
much molested by the savages, yet they
had had some skirmishes with them;.
and that they begged of him to write
to me to think of the promise I had
made to fetch them away, that they
might see their country again before
they died.
But  I was gone a wildgoosc chase,
indeed! and they that will have any
more of me must be content to follow
me into a new variety of follies, hard-
ships, and wild adventures, wherein the
justice of Providence may be duly ob-
served; and we may see how easily
Heaven can gorge lis with our own
desires, make' the strongest of our
wishes be our affliction, and punish us
most severely with those very things
which we think. it would be our ut-
most happiness to be allowed in.
Whether 1 had business .or no busi-
ness, away 1 went; it is no time now
to enlarge upon the reason or absur-
dity of my own conduct, but to come
to * the history; 1 was embarked for
the voyage, and the voyage I went
I shall only add a word or two
concerning my honest popish  cler-
gyman j for let their opinion of us,
and of all other heretics in general,
as they call us, be as uncharitable
as it may, 1 verily believe this man
was very sincere, and wished the
good of* all men: yet I • believe he
was upon the reserve in many of his
expressions, to prevent giving me of-
fence; for 1 scarce heard him once
call on the blessed Virgin, or mention
St. Jago or his guardian angel, though'
so common with the rest of them:.
however, 1 say, 1 had not, the> least
doubt of his sincerity and pious in-/
tentions on his own part; and I am
Irmly of opinion, if the jest of the
popish missionaries were like^ Mi»,
 
M7
they would strive to visit oven the poor
Tartars and Laplanders where they
have nothing to give litem, as well as
covet to flock t«» India, Persia, China,
ike, the most wealthy of the heathen
ronutrie.w; tor if they expected to
brin«" no gains to their church by if,
it may well be admired how they came
to admit tlie < -hiuese Confucius into
I In* calendar of the Christian saints.
Bui this by the bye.
A ship being ready to sail for LUhon,
my pious priest asked me leave to go
thither; being still* m he observed,
bound never to fiiikli any voyage he
began. How happy had it been for
ine if I had gone with him I But it was
too late now: nil tilings Heaven ap-
point m for the best: had 1 gone with
him, 1 had never had so many things
to be thankful for, and the reader had
never heard of the second part of the
travels a-nd adventures of Robinson
Crusoe; ho I must here leave ex-
claiming at myself, and go on with my
voyage. From the Brazils we made
directly over the Atlantic Sea to the
Cape of (iood Hope, and had a toler-
able good voyage, our course gene-
rally south-east, now and thm a storm,
and" some contrary winds, but my
disasters at sea were at end; my future
rubs and cross events were to befall
ine on shore, that it might appear the
land was as well prepared to be our
scourge as the sea.
Our ship was on a trading voyage,
and had a supercargo on board, who
was to direct all her motions after
she arrived at the Cape, only being
limited to a certain number of days for
stay, by charter-party, at the several
ports she was to got to. This was
none of my business, neither did!
meddle with it; my nephew, the cap-
tain, and the supercargo, adjusting
all those things between them, as they
thought fit
We staid at the Cape no longer
than was needful to take in fresh
water, but made the best of our
way for the coaat of Coromandel.
We were Indeed informed, that a
French man "of war of fifty guns,
and two large merchant ships, were
gone fur the Indies; and as 1 knew we
were at war with France, 1 had ?ome
apprehensions of them; but they
wenf, their own way, and we heard no
more of them.
1 shall not pester th« reader with
a tediou.i description of place*, jour-
nals of our voyages, variation* of
the compass, latitudes, trade* winds
&e.; it is enough to name the porta
and places which we touched at, and
what; occurred to us upon our pans,
ing from one to another. We touch-
ed first at the island of Madagascar,
where, though the people are fierce
and treacherous, and very well armed
with lances and bows, which they
use with inconceivable dexterity, yet
we fared very well with them awhile;
they treated m very civilly; and, for
some trifles which we gave them, such
m knives, acinars, &e. they brought its
eleven good fat bullocks of a mid*
dling size, which we took in, partly
for fresh provisions for our present
spending, and the rest to salt for the
ship's use.
We were obliged to stay here some
time after we had furnished ourselves
with provisions; and I who was al-
ways too curious to look into every
nook of the world wherever I came,
was for going on bhore as often as
I could. It was on the east side of
the island that we went on shore one
evening: and the people, who, by
I lie way, are very numerous, came
thronging about up, and stood gazing at
us at a distance; but as we had traded
freely with them, and had been kind-
ly used, we thought ourselves in no
danger; but when we ssiw the people,
we cut three boughs out of a tree, and
stuck them tip at a distance from us;
which, it seems, h a murk in that
country, not only of a^ truce and
friendship, but when it is accepted,
the other side sets up three poles or
boughs, which is a signal that they
accept the truce too; but then this
is a known condition of the truce,
that you are not to pass beyond their
three poles, towards them, nor they
to come past' your three poles, or
boughs,'towards you; so that you
are perfectly secure within the three
poles, and all the space between your
poles and theirs is allowed like a mar-
ket for free converse, traffic and com-

werce. When you go thcre„you must
not carry your weapons with you:
and if they come into that space,
they *«tick up their javelins and lances
all "at the first poles, and come on
unarmed; but if any violene Is offered
them, and the truce thereby broken,
away the? run to the poles, and lay
hold* of their weapons, and the truce
is at end.
It happened one evening" when we
went on shore that a greater number
of their people came down than usual,
hut all very friendly and civil; and
they brought several kinds of pro-
visions, for which we satisfied them
with such toys as we had; their wo-
men also brought us milk and roots,
and several things very acceptable to
ns» and all was quiet; and we made
us a tittle tent or hut of some
boughs of trees, and lay on shore all
night.
1 knoiv not what was the occasion,
hut I was not so well satisfied to lieK
on shore as the rest; and the
boat riding at an anchor about
a stone's cast from the land, with
two men in her to take care of her,
I made one of them come on shore;
and getting some boughs of trees to
cover us also in the boat, I spread
the sail at the bottom of the boat,
and lay under cover of the branches
of the trees all night in the boat.
About two o'clock in the morning
we heard one of our men make a
terrible noise on the shore, calling
out, for God's sake, to bring the boat
in, and come and help them, for they
were all like to be murdered; at the
game time !heard the fire of five mus-
kets, which was the number of the
guns they had, and that three times
over; for, it seems, the natives here
were not so easily frightened with
guns as the savages were in America,
where I had to do with them. All
this while I knew not what was the
matter, but rousing immediately from
sleep -with the noise, I caused the
boat to be thrust in, and resolved,
with three fusees we had on board, to
land and assist our men.
• We got the boat soon to the-shore,
but our men were in too mucli
haste; for being come to the shore,
they plunged into the water, to get
to "the* boat with all the expedition
they could, being pursued by between
three and four hundred men. Our
men were but nine in all, and only
five of them had fusees with them*;
the rest had pistols and swords, in-
deed, but they were of small use to
them.
We took up seven of our men,
and with difficulty enough too, three
of them being very ill wounded; and
that which was still worse was, that
while we stood in the boat to take
our men in, we were in as much dan-
ger as they were in on shore; for they
poured their arrows in upon us so
thick, that we were glad to barricade
the side of the boat up with the
benches, and two or three loose boards,
which, to our great satisfaction, we
had by mere accident in the boat.
And yet, had it been day-light, then-
are, it seems, such exact marksmen,
that if they could have seen but the
least part of any of us, they would
have been sure of us. We had, by
the light of the moon, a little sight
of them, as they stood pelting us
from the shore with darts and arrows;
and having got ready our fire-arms,
we gave them a volley, that we could
hear, by the cries of some of them,
had wounded several; however, they
stood thus in battle-array on the
shore till break of day, which we
suppose was that they might see the
better to take their aim at us.
In this condition we lay, and could
not tell how to weigh our anchor or set
up our sail, because we must needs
stand up in the boat, and they were as
sure to hit us as we were to nit a bird
in a tree with small shot. We made
signals of distress to the ship, which
though she rode a league off, yet my
nephew the captain, hearing our firing,
and by glasses perceiving the posture
we lay in, ana that we fired towards
the shore, pretty well understood
us; and weighing anchor with all
speed, he stood as near the shore as lie
durst with the ship, and then sent an-
other boat, with ten hands in her, to

eomc too near, telling: tbem what con-
dition we were in; however they stood
111 near to us, and one of the meu
taking the end of a tow-line in his
hand* and keeping one boat between
Ititij awl the enemy, so that they could
not perfectly see him, swam on hoard
11s, and made fa^t the line to the boat;
upon which we slipped otit a little ca-
ble, nnd leaving our anchor behind,
they lowed ib out of the reach of the
arrows; we all the while lying closv
behind 'the barriendo we had* made.
A< soon as we were got from he-
tween the ship and tke shore, that we
could lay her side to the shore, sluM'un
along just hy them, and poured in a
broadside among them loaded with
pieces of iron and lead, small bullets,
and such stuff, besides the great shot,
which made a terrible havoc among
the in.
When we were got on board ami out
of danger we had rime to examine in-
to the occasion of tliis fray; ami, in-
deed, our supercargo, who had been
often in those parfsf put me upon it;
for lie said lie was sure the inhabitants
won Id not have touched us after we
had made a truce, if we had not done
something to provoke them to iu At
length it came out that an old woman,
who had come to sell us some milk,
had brought it within our poles, and a
young woman with her, who also
brought some roots or herbs; and
while the old woman (whether she was
mother to the young woman or no they
could not tell) was selling us the milk,
one of our men offered some rudeness
4o the wench that was with her, at
which the old woman made a great
noise: however, the seaman would not
quit his prize, but carried her out of
the old woman's sight among the trees,
it being almost dark; the old woman
went away without her, and, as we
may suppose* made an outcry among
the people she came from; who, upon
notice, raised this great army upon us
in three four or hours; and it was great
©dels but we had all been destroyed.
One of our men was killed with a
lance thrown at him just at the be-
ginning of the attack, as< he sallied out
of the teat they had made: the rest
came off free, all but the fellow who
was the occasion of all the mischief,
who paid dear enough for his black
mistress, for we could riot hear what be-
came of him 11 great while We lay
upon the shore two days after though
the wind presented, and made tdg'tmb
for him, and made our boat sail up
shore and down shore several leagues•
but in vain, ho we were obliged to
give him over; and if ho alone had
suffered for it, the loss had been less.
I could not «*utisfy myself however,
without venturing on shore once, more,
to try if I could learn any thing of him
or them; it was the third night after
the fiction thai I had a great mind to
learn, if 1 could by any means, what
mischief we had done, and how the
guine stood on the Indians' side*, I
was careful to do it in the. dark, lest
we should be attacked again; but I
ought, indeed, to have been sure that
the men I went with had been under
my command, before I engaged in n
thing so hazardous and mischievous
as J was brought into by it, without de-
sign.
'"We took twenty as stout fellow*
with us as any in the ship, besides the
supercargo and myself, and we landed
two hours before midnight, at the
same place where the Indians stood
drawn up in the evening before: 1
landed here, because, my design, as I.
have said, was chiefly to see if they
had quitted the field, and if they had
left any marks behind them of the
mischief we had done them; and I
thought if we could surprise one or
two "of them, perhaps we might get
our man again, by way of exchange*
We landed without any noise, and
divided our men into two bodies,
whereof the boatswain commanded
one, and I the other. We neither saw
nor heard any body stir when we
landed; and we inarched up, one
body at a distance from the other, to
the 'place; but at first could §ee no-
thing, it being very dark; till by and
by our boatswain, who led the irst
party, stumbled aid fell over a dead
body. This made them halt awhile;
for knowing by the circumstances that
they were at the place where the In-
dians had stood, they waited for my
coming up there. 'We concluded to

they should, they did hot doubt of

to consider the ship and the voyage,

that they were intrusted with the

miscarried, the ship might be lost fW

ADVENTURES OF
 
comrade so enraged them, as before,
that they swore to one another they
would be revenged, and that not an In-
dian that came into their hands should
have any quarter; and to work they
went immediately, and yet not so
inadly as might be expected from the
rage and fury they were in. Their
first care was to get something that
would soon take tire, but, after it little
'search, they found that would be to
no purpo.se j for most of the houses
were low, and thatehed with flags
and rushes, of which the country Is
fall; so they presently made some
wild-lire, as we rail it, by wetting a
., little powder in the palin of their
hands; and in a quarter of nit hour
they set the town on lire in four or
live places, and particularly that
house wheie the Indians were not
gone to bod.
As .soon an tb,- fir- began to bk*/-:e
the poor i'Vighteimd creatures te^ao. to
rush out to sir, c their Imv, I nit met
with their fate in the attempt; and
cspeehniy at the door, where they
drove then: bark, the hoaUwmn him-
self kiiiing one or two with his pole-
axe; the hou^e being large, and
many in it, be did nut rare to go in,
but eailed for a- hand-grottadt^ and
threw it among them, which at
first frightened them, but, when it
burst, made siieh havock among them,
that they cried out in a hideous man-
ner. In short, most of the .Indians
who were in the open part of the
house were killed or hurt with the
grenado, except two or three more
who pressed to the door, which the
boatswain and two more kept with
their bayonets on the mur/les of their
pieces, and dispatched all that (nine
iu their way: but there was another
apartment in the house, where the
prince or king, or whatever he was,
and several others were; and these
were kept in till the house, which was
by this time all in a light flame, fell
in upon them, and they were smo-
thered together.
All this while they fired not a gun,
because they would not waken" the
people faster than they could master
them; but the fire began to waken
them fast enough, and our fellow*
were glad to keep a little together
in bodies j Tor the ire grew m ra-
ging, all the houses being made of
light combustible stuff, that they
could hardly bear the street between
them; and their business was to fol-
low the fire, for the surer execution:
as fast as the fire cither forced the
people out of those houses which
where burning', or frightened them
out of others, our people were
ready at their doors to knock them
on the head, still calling and hol-
loing one to another to, remember
Tom Jefiry
While this was doing, 1 must con-
fess I was very uneasy, and especially
when 1 saw the flames of the town,
which, it being night, seemed to be
just by me. My nephew, the captain,
who was roused by his men, seeing
such a lire, wps \ery uneasy, not
knowing what the matter wa.s or
what danger I was m, especially
hoarlmr the earn? too, for by this time

the supercargo iu the hoar, with no

was i>-!ad that we wese well, yet he
wa.tf iu the same impatience with us
to know what was doing; for the
noi.se continued, and the flame increa-
sed; hi short, it was next to an im-
possibility feu* any man in the wofH
to restrain their curiosity to know what
had happened, or their concern for
the safety of the men; in a word, the
captain told me he would go and
help his men, let what would come,

with' the men, the safety of the ship,
the danger of the voyage, the interest
of the owncr^and merchants, &c. and

and filled ti.i with horror. I must

city, or at the takiiur <i town bv storm.
1 had heard of Oliver Cromwell taking1
Drogheda, in. Ireland, and killing man,
woman, and child; audi had re;.<! of
Count Tilly sacking the city of Alagde-
bourg, and cutting the throats of
twenty-two thousand of all sexes; but
I never had an idea of the thing
itself before, nor Is it possible to des-
cribe it, or the horror that was upon-
our minds at hearing' it. However,
we, went on, and at length came to the
town, though there was no entering
the streets of it for the fire. The first
object we met with was the ruins of
a hut or house, or rather the ashes of
it, for the house was consumed; and
just before it, plain now to be seen by
the light of the lire, lay four men
and three women killed/and as we
thought, one or two more lay in
the heap among the fire; itt short there
were such instances of rage altogether
barbarous, and of a fury something
beyond. what was human, ' that we
thought It impossible oar men could
bft^guSlty-of it; or if they were the
authors of it, we thought they ought
i,o be every one of them put to the
woi\<t of death*. Hut this was not all:
we Haw I he lire ittetvaied forward, and
the rry went on just a.s the lire went
on; *u that we were in the utmost
confusion. We, advanced a little way
farther; and, behold, to our astonish-
ment, three naked women, and crying
in a most; dreadful manner/ came fly-
ing as if they had wings, and after
them sixteen or seventeen men,
natives, in the same, terror and
consternation, with three of our
Kngliiih bukdmr!* in the rear; who
when they could not overtake them,
fired in among then), am! one that was
killed by their shot fell down in our
wiglit. When the rest saw u,s, believ-
ing m to be their enemies, and that
we, would murder them as well as
those that pursued them, they set up
a mo*t dreadful shriek, especially the
women, and two of them fell down,
an if already dead with the fright.
My verv soul shrunk within me,
and my blood ran chill in my veins,
when J. saw this: and 1 believe, had
the three Knglhsh sailors that pursued
them come on, 1 had made our men
kill them all: however, we took some
ways to let the poor flying creatures
know that we would not hurt them;
ami immediately they came up to is,
and kneeling down, with their hawk
lifted up, made piteous lamentation to
us to. save them, which we let them
know we would; whereupon they
crept all together in a huddle close
behind us, as for protection,. 1 left my
men drawn up together, and charging
them to hurt nobody, but, if porfsdbie,
to get at some of our people, and see
what devil it was possessed them*
and what they intended to do, and
to command them off; assuring them
that if they staid till daylight, they
would have a hundred thousand men
about their ears: I say, I left tbem,
and went among those dying people,
taking only two of our men with me;
and there was indeed a piteous spec-
tacle among thern; some of tuem
had their feet terribly burned, with
trampling and running through the
fire, others their hands burned; one,
of the women' had fallen down In the

lire, and was, very mueh burned before
she could get, put again; and two or
three of the men had cuts in their
backs and thighs, from our men pur-
suing; and, another was shot through
the body, and died while I was there.
1 would fain have learned what the
occasion of all this was, .but 1 could
not understand one word they said;
though, by signs, 1 perceived some of
them knew not what was the occasion
themselves. I was so terrified in my
thoughts at this outrageous attempt,
that I could not stay there, but went
back to my own men, and resolved _ to
go into "the middle of the town,
through the fire, or whatever might
be in'the way, and put au end to it,
cost what, it would j accordingly, as 1
came back to my men, I told them my
resolution, and com in ended them to
follow me: when at the very moment
came four of our men, with the boat-
swain at their head roving over heaps of
bodies they had killed, all covered with
blood and dust, as if they wanted more
people to massacre, when our men hol-
loed to them as loud as they could
hollo; and with mueh ado one of them
made them hear, so that they knew
who we were and came up to us.
As soon as the boatswain saw us,
he set up a hollo like a shout of
triumph, for having as he thought,
more help come; and without waiting
to hear me, Captain, says he, noble
captain! 1 am glad you are come;
we are not half done yet; villainous
hell-hound dogs! I'll kill as many of
them as poor Tom has hairs upon
his head: we have sworn to spare
none of them j we'll root out the very
nation of them from the earth; and
thus he ran on, out of breath too with
action, and would not give us leave
to speak a word.
At last, raising my voice, that 1
might silence him a little, Barbarous
dog! said I, what are you doing? J
wont have one creature touched more
upon pain of death: 1 charge you upon
your life,, to stop your hands, and
staid still here, or you are a dead man
this minute,—Why, sir, says he, ,do
you know what you do, or what they
nave done? if you want a reason for
whit we hive done, come, hither; and
with that he showed me the poor fel-
low hanging, with his throat cut,
1 confess" I was urged then myself,
and at another time would have been
forward enough j but 1 thought they
had carried their rage too far," and re-
membered Jacob's words to his sons
Simeon and Levi-—" Cursed be their
anger, for it was fierce; and their
wrath, for it was cruel/' But 1 had
now a new task upon my hands $ for
when the men 1 carried with me saw
the sight, as I had clone, i had as much
to do to restrain them as 1 should have
had with the others; nay, my nephew
himself fell in with them, and told me,
in their hearing, that he was only con-
cerned for fear of the men being over-
powered; and as to -the people, he
thought not one of them ought to live j
for they had all glutted themselves
with the murder of the poor man, and
that they ought to be used like mur-
derers; upon these words, away ran
eight of my men, with the boatswain
and liis crew, to complete their bloody
work; and 1, seeing it quite out of my
power to restrain them, came away
pensive and sad; for 1 could not bear
the sight, much less the horrible noise
and cries of the poor wretches that fell
into their hands,
I got nobody to come back with me
but the supercargo and two men, and
with these walked back to the boat.
It was a very great piece of folly in me,
I confess, to venture back as it were
alone; for as it began now to be
almost day, and the alarm had run over
the country, there stood about forty
men, armed with lances and bows, at
the little place where the twelve or
thirteen houses stood, mentioned be-
fore; but by accident 1 missed that
place, and came directly to the sea-
side, and by the time 1 got to the sea-
side it was broad day: Immediately 1
took the pinnace and went on board,
and sent her back to assist the men in
what mighf happen.
1 observed, about the time that 1
came to the boat-side, that the Ire was
pretty well out, and the noise abated:
but in abouf1 half an hour after 1
got on hoard 1 heard a volley of. pur
men's Ire-arms, , and saw a 'great
imoke; thin, as 1 understood after-
246
 
wards, wa* our men falling upon the
men who, its I said, stood at the few
houses on the way, of whom they killed
sixteen or seventeen, and set all the
booses on fire, hut did not meddle with
the women or children.
By the lime the men got to the
shore again with the pinnace, our men
began to appear; they came dropping
in,'not in two bodies as they went, hut
straggling here and there in such a
manner,'that a small force of resolute
men might have cut them all off. But
the dread of them was upon the whole
country; and the men were surprised,
and so'friirhtencd, that I believe a hun-
dred of them would have fled at the
Fight of hut five of our men; nor in all
this terrible action was there a man
that made any considerable defencej
they were so surprised between the
terror of the fire and the sudden attack
of our men in the dark, that they knew
not which way to turn themselves; for
if they fled one way they were met by
one party; if back again, by another;
so that they were every where knocked
down: nor did any of our men receive
the least hurt, except one that .sprained
his foot, and another that had one of
his hands burned.
! was very angry with my nephew,
the captain," {tod, indeed, with all the
men, in my iiiincl, hut with him in par-
ticular, as well for his acting so out of
liis duty, as commander of the ship,
and having the charge of the voyage
upon him, as in his prompting, rather
than cooling, the rage of his blind men,
in so bloody and cruel an enterprise.
My nephew "answered me very respect-
fully, hut-told me that when lie saw
the body of the poor seaman whom
they had murdered in so cruel and bar-
barous a manner, lie was not master of
himself, nckher co?-,l he govern his
passion; he owned!: should not have
done so, as he was commander of the
ship; but as he was x man. and nature
moved him, he could not bear it As
for the rest of the men, they were not
subject to me at all, and they knew it
well enough; so they took no notice
of my dislike/
The next day we set sail, so we
never heard any more of it Our men
differed in the account of the number
they had killed; but according to the
best of their accounts, put all together,
they killed or destroyed about one hun-
dred and fifty people, men, women,
and children,* and left not a house
standing in the town* As for the poor
fellow 'Tom JefiVy, as lie was quite
dead (for his throat was so cut that lm
head was half off.) it would do him no
service to bring him away; so they
only took hiai down .from the tree,
where lie was hanging by one hand.
However just our men thought this
action, I was against them in it, and f
always, after that time, told them God
would blast the voyage; for I looked
upon all the blood they shed that night
to be murder in them: for though it is
true that they had killed Tom Jetfry,
yet Jellry was the aggressor, had bro-
ken the truce, and had violated or de-
bauched a young woman of theirs, who
came down to them innocently, and on
the faith of the public capitulation.
The boatswain defended this quarrel
when we were afterwards on board.
He said it was true that we seemed to
break the truce, but really had not;
and that the war was begun the night
before by the natives themselves, who
had shot at us, and killed one of our
men without any just provocation; so
that as we were in a capacity to fight
them now, we might also be in a capa-
city to do ourselves justice upon them
in * an extraordinary manner; that
though the poor man had taken a little
liberty with the wench, he ought not to
have been murdered, and that in such
a villainous manner; and that they did
nothing but what was just, and what
the laws of God allowed to be done to
murderers.
One would think this should have
been enough to have warned us against
going on shore amongst heathens and
barbarians; but it is impossible to
make mankind wise but at their own
expense; and their experience seems,
to be always of most use to them when
it is dearest bought.
We were now"bound to the gulf of
Persia, and from thence to the coast o,f
Coromandet, only to touch at Surat
but the chief of the supercargo's de-
sign lay at the bay of Bengal;"where
if he missed his business outward
b3
ADVENTURE** OP
 
bound, he was to go up to China, and
return to the coast as he came home.
The first disaster that befel us was
ia the gulf of Persia, where fire of our
men venturing on shore on the Arabian
side of the gulf, were surrounded by
the Arabians, and either ail killed or
carried away into slavery; the rest of
the bout's crew were not able to rescue
them,.and had but just time to get off
their boat. I began to upbraid them
with the just retribution of Heaven in
this case: hut the boatswain very
warmly 'told me, he thought 1 went
farther in roy censures than 1 could
show any warrant for in Scripture;
»im1 Referred to Luke xiii. 4. where our
Saviour intimates that those men on
whom the tower of Siloam fell were
not'sinners above all the Galileans;
but that which put me to silence in the
ease was, that not one of these five
men who were now lost were of those,
who went on shore to the massacre of
Madagascar, so I always called it,
though our men could not bear to hear
the word memacre with any patience.
But my frequent preaching" to them
on the subject had worse consequences
than 1 expected; and the boatswain,
who had been the head of the attempt,
came up boldly to me one time; and
told me lie found that 1 brought that
affair continually upon fbe stage; that
1 made unjust reflections upon" it, and
had used the men very ill on that ac-
count, and himself in particular;1 that
as 1 was but a passenger, and had no
command in the ship, or concern in
the voyage, they were not obliged to
bear it; that they did not know' but 1
might hare some ill design in my head, 
and perhaps to call them to an account
for it when they came to England;
and that, therefore, unless! would re-
solve to have done with it, and also not
to concern myself any farther with
, Jiim, or -any of his affairs, he would
leave the ship'; for he did not think it
was safe to sail with me among them.
I heard Mm patiently enough till he
had clone," and then told him, that i
confessed ! 'had all alopg opposed the
massacre of Madagascar, and that 1
had, on all occasions, spoken my mind
freelf .about it, though not more upon
'him than any of the rest; that as to
having no command in the ship, that
was true; nor did 1 exercise any autho-
rity, only look the liberty of speaking
my iniiid in tilings which publicly con-
cerned us all; and what concern*! had
in the voyage was none of his business;
that 1 was a considerable owner in the
ship; in that claim, 1 conceived ! had
a right to speak even farther than 1
had done, and would not be account-
able to him or any one else; and be-
gan to be a little warm with him. He
made but little reply to me at that
time, and 1 thought the affair had been
over. We were at this time in the
road at Bengal; and being willing to
see the place, ! went on shore with' the
supercargo, in the ship's boat, to divert
myself; unci towards evening was pre-
paring to go on hoard, when one of
the men came to me, and told me he
would not have mc trouble myself to
come clown to the boat, for they had
orders not to carry me on board any
more. Any one may guess what a sur-
prise T was in at so insolent a message;
and 1 asked the mau, who bade him
deliver that message to iner He fold
me, the cockswain. I said no more to
the fellow, but bade him let them
know he4 had deliveied his message,
and that 1 had given him no answer
to it.
1 immediately went and found out
the supercargo, and told him the story;
adding, what I presently foresaw, that
there would be a mutiny in the ship;
and entreated him to go immediately
on board the slop in an Indian boar,
and acquaint the captain of it. But 1
might have spared this intelligence, for
before I had spoken to him on shore
the matter was effected on board. The
boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter,
and all the inferior officers, as soon ar,
I was gone off* in the beat, came up,
and desired to speak with the captain;
and there the boatswain, making a long
harangue, and repeating all he had said
to me, told the captain, in a few
words, that as I was now gone peace-
ably on shore, they were loath to use
any violence with me, which, if I had
not gone on shore, they would oilier-
ways have done, to oblige me to have
f'one; they therefore thought fit to tell
im,'that*as they shipped themselves
M7
 
to serve in the ship under his com-
mand, they would perform it well and
faithfully;" but if 1 would not (put the
ship, or tli*1 captain oblige Hie to quit
it, they would all leave the ship, and
sail no farther with him; and at that
word «//, lie turned his face tow arils the
mainmast, whieh was, it seems, the
signal agreed on between them, at
which all the seamen, being got toge-
ther there, cried out, One and all! one
und all!
My nephew, the captain, was a man
of spirit, and of great presence of
mind; and though he was surprised,
you way be sure,' at the thing, yet lie
told them calmly that he would*consi-
der of the matter; hut that lie could
do nothing in it till he had .spoken to
me about it, lie used sonic argu-
ments with them to show them the un-
reasonableness and injustice of the
thing: hut it was all* in vain; they
swore, and shook hands round before
Ms face, that they would all go on
shore, unless he would engage to them
not to sutler me to come any more on
board the slop,
This was a hard article upon him,
who knew hU obligation to me, arid
did not know how I might take it: m
lie began to talk smartly to them; told
them that f was a very considerable
owner of the >hip, and that, injustice,
lie could not put me out of i»W own
house; that this was next; floor to
serving jnc as the famous pirate liiild
had done, who made a mutiny in the
ship, net the captain on shore on an
uninhabited island, and ran away with
the ship; that let them go into what
ship they would, if ever they came to
England again it would crfst'them very
dear; that the ship was mine, and that
he could not put me out of it, tint he
would rather lose the ship and the
'voyage too than disoblige me so much;
so they might do as' they pleased:
however, lie would go on shore and talk
with me, and invited the boatswain to
go with him, and perhaps they might
accommodate the matter with me. But
they all rejected the proposal, and said
they would have nothing to do with me
any more; and if 1 came on board,
they would all go. m shore. Well,
said the captain, if you are ail of this
mind, lei mo go on shore and talk
with him. So awn? he came" to me
with this account, a little' after the
message had been brought' to1 me from
the cockswain*
1 was very glad to see my nephew, 1
must confess; for 1 was not without
apprehensions that they would confine
him by violence, yet sail, and run away
with (lie ship; and then 1 had been
stripped naked in a remote country,
having nothing to help myself; in
short, !had been in a worse ease than
when 1 was alone in the island. But
they had not come that length, it
seems, to my satisfaction; and when
my nephew told mo what they had said
to him, and how they had sworn mnl
shook hands that they would, one and
all, leave ship if I mm suffered to come
on board, I told him lie should not be
concerned at it at all, for I would stay
on shore: 1 only desired he would take
care and send me all my necessary
things on jihore, and leave me a suffi-
cient sum of money, and 1 would find
my way to England im well as J could.
This was a heavy piece of news to
ray nephew, but there wm no way to
help it but to comply; so, in short, lie
went on board the fchip again, and sa-
tisfied I lie men that his' uncle had
yielded to their importunity, arid had
sent for hi.-* goods from on board the
ship; so that the matter was over in a
few hour,-?, the men returned to their
duty, and J began to consider what
course 1 should 'steer.
I was now alone in the most remme
part^ of the world, as I think I may
call it, for I was near three thousand
leagues by sea-farther of* from Eng-
land than 1 was at my island; only,'it
k true, I might travel here by land
over the great Mogul's country to
Sural, might go from thence to Bas-
saro by sea, up the gulf of Persia, and
take the way of the caravans, over the
Desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Sean-
deroon; from thence by sea again to
Italy, and so overland into France;
and this put together might at least be
a full diameter'of the globe, or-wore.
1 had another way before me, 'Which
was to wait for some English ships,
which were coming to Bengal. from
Acbin, oa titt island of Sumatra;-and

ADVENTURES OF
 
get- passage on board them for Eng-
land. But as' 1 came hither without
any concern with the English Emt
India Company, so it would lie dif-
ficult to go from hence without their
licence, unless with great favour of
the captains of the ships, or the Com-
pany's factors; and to both 1 was an
utter stranger.
Here I had the mortification to see
the ship set sail without me; a treat-
ment 1 think a man in my circum-
stances scarce ever met with, except
from pirates running away with the
ship, and setting those that'would not
agree with their villainy on shore.
Indeed, this was next door to if, both
ways; however, my nephew left me
two servants, or rather one companion
and one servant; the first was clerk to
the purser, whom lie engaged to go
with me, and the other was his own
servant 1 took me also a good lodg-
ing in the house of an Englishwo-
man, where several merchants'lodged,
some French, two Italians, or rather
Jews, and one Englishman; here I
was handsomely enough entertained:
and that I might not be said to run
rashly upon any thing, 1 staid here
above nine months considering what
course to take, and how to manage my-
self. 1 had some English goods with
me of value, and a considerable sum
of money: my nephew furnishing
me with a thousand pieces of eight,
and a letter of credit for mere, if I
had occasion, that I might not be
straitened, whatever might'happen,
1 quickly disposed of my goods to
advantage, and, as 1 originally intend-
ed, I bought here some very good
diamonds, widely of all other things,
were the most proper for me, in my
present circumstances; because 1
could always carry my whole estate
about me.
After a long stay here, and many
proposals made for my return to
England, but none falling, to my mind,
the English merchant wholodged with
me, and whom, I had contracted an
intimate acquaintance with, came to
me one morning; Countryman, says
lie, 1 have 'a-project to communicate
to yon, which, as'it suits with my
, thought** may,-for aught 1 know*..suit
 
with yours also, when you 'thai! hare
thoroughly considered it. Here ire
are posted, you by accident, aid i by
my own choice, in a part of the world
very remote from our own country;
hut it is in a country where, by us who
understood trade and business, a great
deal of money is to be got. If you
will put one thousand pounds to my
one thousand pounds, we will hire a
ship here, the first we mm get to onr
minds; you shall be captain, I'll be
merchant, and we'll go a trading
voyage to China: for what should
we stand still for? The whole work!
is in a motion, rolling round and
round ; all the creatures of Cod, hea-
venly bodies and earthly, are busy t*r\d
diligent; why should we be idle?
There are no drones in the world but
men ; why should we be of that num-
ber?
! lilted this proposal very well, and
the more because it seemed to be ex-
pressed with so much good will, and
in so friendly a manner. I will not
say but that I might, by my loose un-
hinged circumstances, be the fitter to
embrace a proposal for trade, or in-
deed any thing else; whereas, other-
wise, trade was none of my element.
However, I might perhaps say with
some truth, that if trade was not my
element, rambling was, and no pro"-
posal for seeing any part of the world
which 1 had never seen before could
possibly come amiss to me.
It was, however, some time before
we could get a ship to otir minds, and
when we had got a vessel, it was not
easy to get English sailors; that is to
say, so many as were necessary to
govern the voyage and manage the
sailors which we should pick up' there.
After some time we got a mate, a
boatswain, and a gunner, English'; a
Dutch carpenter, and three foremast-
men. With these we "found we could
do well enough, having Indian seamen,
such as they were, te make up.
There are so many travellers who
have wrote the history of their voy-
ages and travels th'is way, that it

to others, tmd refer llic reader to those
journals awl travels of Englishmen of
which many 1 fuitl are published, and
more promised every day; it is
enough for me to tell you that we
made tlii? voyage to Achin, lit the
island of Sumatra, and from thence to
Siam where we exchanged some of our
wares for opium and some arrack; the
first a commodity which bear* a great
price among the Chinese, and which,
itt that time, was much wanted tlit»n»»
In a word, we went up to Sushan,
made a very great voyage, were eight
mouths out, and returned to Bengal;
tijid I was very well satisfied with my
adventure, I observe that our people
in England often udmirc how officers
wliivdi the company send into India,
and the merchants which generally
stay there, get such very great, estates
as they do, and sometimes conie home
worth sixty or .seventy thousand
pounds at a time; but it is no wonder,
or at least we shall see so much farther
into it when wo consider the innumcra-
able ports and places where they have
it free commerce, that it will be none;
and much less ii will be so when we
consider that at those places and ports
where the English ships come, there
is such great and constant demands
for .the growth of all other countries,
that there is a certain vent for the re-
turns, as well as a market abroad for
the goods carried out.
In short, we made a very good voy-
age, and 1 got so much money by my
first adventure, and such an insight
into the method of getting more, that
had I been twenty years younger, 1
should have been tempted to' have
staid here, and sought no farther, for
making any fortune; but what was all
this to a mail upwards of threescore,
that was rich enough, and came
abroad more in obedience to a restless
desire of seeing the world than a cove-
tous desire of gaining by if? And,
indeed, I think it is with great justice
1 now call it restless desire, for it was
so, When I was at home, 1 was
restless, to go abroad; and when 1
was abroad, 1 was restless to be at
home. 1 sty, what was this gain to
me? J wis rich enough already, nor
bud f any uneasy df sirei about getting
more money;,and therefore the profit
of the voyage to mn was of uo great'
force for the prompting me forward to
farther undertaking!*; hence 1 ihmigpUt
that by this voyage 1 had made iw
progress at, all, because 1 was come
back, as I might call it, to the' place
from whence 1 came, as to a boine-*:
whereas my eye, which, like that
which Solomon speaks of was never
satisfied with sertng, was still more
desirous of wandering and seeing, I
was come into it part of the world
which I was never in before, and that
part, in particular, which I had heard
much of, and was resolved, to see m
much of it as I could; and then 1
thought I might say I had seen all the
world, that was worth seeing.
But my fellow-traveller and I hud
different notions: I do not name this
to insist on my owu, fori acknowledge
his were the most just, and the most
suited to the end of a merchant'* life;
who, when he is abroad upon adven-
tures, it is his wisdom to stick to
that, as the best thing for him, which
he is like to get the most money by.
My new friend kept himself to the
nature of the thing, and would haw
been content to have gone like a car-
rier's horse, always to the same inn,
backward and forward, provided lie
could, as lie called it, find his account
in it. On the other hand, mine was
the notion of a mad rambling boy, that
never cares to see a thing twice over.
But this was not all: 1 had a kind of
iinpatience upon me to be nearer home,
and yet the most unsettled resolution
imaginable which way to go. In the
interval of these consultations, , my
friend, who was always upon the search
for business, proposed another voyage
to me among the Spice Islands, and:to
bring home'a loading of cloves <from
the Manillas, or thereabouts; places,
indeed, where the Dutch trade, but is-
lands belonging partly to the Spani-
ards; though we went not so far, but
to some other, where they have riot the
whole power, as they hive at Batavta,
Ceylon, &c.
We were not long in. preparing for
this voyage 5 the chief difficulty w»fr in
bringing me, to come into, it: however,
at last, nothing flue offering* and -finding
 
 
ADVENTUfiES Of
 
thai really stirring about and trading,
the profit being so great, and, as I may
say, certain, had more pleasure in if,
and had wore satisfaction to my mind,
than sitting still, which, to me espe-
cially, was the uuhappiest pari of life,
J resolved on this voyage too, which we
made very successfully, touching at
Borneo, and seveiai 'islands whose
names I do not remember, and came
home in about live months. We sold
our spice, which was chiefly cloves and
fiome nutmegs, to the Persian mer-
chants, who carried them away to the
gulf; and making near live of one, wc
really got a great deal of money.
My friend, when we made up this
account, smiled at me: Well now, said
he, with a sort of agreeable- insult upon
my indolent temper, is not this better
than walking about here, like a man of
nothing to do, and spending our time
in staring fit the nonsense and igno-
rance of the Pagans?—Why, truly,
says I, my friend, I think it kf and*I
begin to be a convert to the principles
of mercliandlsing; but I must tell you,
said I, by the way, yon do not know
what 1 ana doing; for if 1 once conquer
my backwardness, and embark hear-
tily, as old as 1 am, I shall harrass you
up and down the world fill J tire you;
for 1 shall pur.sue it so eagerly, 1 shall
never let you lie ^till
But, to he short with my specula-
tions, ^a little while after this there
came in a .Dutch ship from Batavia;
she was a coaster, not an European
trader, of about two hundred tons bur-
then; 'the ;nen, as they pretended,
having been so sickly, that the captain
had not hands enough to go to sea with,
lie lay by at Bengal; and having, it
seems, got money enough, or being
willing, for other' reasons, to go for
Europe,, he gave public notice he would
sell his ship* This came to my ears
before my new partner heard of k, and
1 had: a great mind to buy it; so I
went to him, and told Mm of it. He
considered awhile, for lie was no rash
man neither; but musing some time,
he replied, she Is a little too big; but,
however,, we .will have her. Accor-
dingly, we bought the ship, and agree-
ing' with < the- .master, we paid for her,
and took possession, When we hat!
done so, we resolved to entertain the
men, if we could, to join them with
those we had, for the pursuing our
business; lint on a sudden, they having
received, not their wages, but their
share of the money, as we afterwards
learnt, not one of them was to lie found;
we inquired much about them, find at
length were told that they were all
gone together by land to Agra, the
great city of the Mogul's residence,
and from thence to travel to Surat, ami
go by sea to the gulf of Persia.
Nothing had so much troubled me a
good while as that 1 should miss this
opportunity of going with them; for
such a ramble, 1 thought, and in such
company as would both have guarded
and diveiled me, would have suited
mightily with my great design: and I
should have both seen the world and
gone homewards too: but I was much
better satisfied a few days after, when 1
came to know what sort of fellows
they were; for, in short, their history
was that this man they called captain was
the gunner only,-not the commander;
that they had been a trading voyage, in
which they had been attacked on shore
by some of the Malays, who had killed
the captain ami three of his men; and
that after the captain was killed, these
men, eleven in number, had resolved to
run away with the ship, which they
did, and brought her to Bengal, leaving
the mate and live men more on shore";
of whom hereafter.
Well, let them get the ship how they
would, we came honestly by her, as we
thought, though we did not, I confess,
examine into thing's so exactly as we
ought; for we never inquired any
thing of the seamen, who would cer-
tainly have faltered in' their account,
contradicted one another, and perhaps
contradicted themselves; or one how
or oilier we should have had reason to
have suspected them; but the man
showed us a bill of sale for the ship, to
one Emanuel Oosterehovcn, or some
such name, for I suppose it was all a for-
gery, and called himself by that name,
and we could not contradict him ; and
withal having no suspicion of the thing*
we went through with our bargain.

We picked up some mom English
sailors here after this, and sonic Dutch;
and now we resolved for a second
voyage to tin* smith-east for cloves, &c.
that*is to sav, among the Philippine
and Malacca* isles; and, in short, not
to till up this part of my story with
trifles, when what is to come is so re-
m-.iikable, I spent, from first to last,
fiix yearn lit this country, trading from
port to port, backward and forward,
and with very flood suecess, and was
now tiie lust year with my new partner,
going in the ship ahove mentioned, on
a voyage to China, hut designing first
to S'iam, to huy riee.
In this voyage, being 1>y contrary
winds obliged to beat up and down a
#reat while in the si raits of Malacca,
and among the islands, we were no
aooncr got clear of those difficult seas
than we found our ship had sprung a
leak, and we were not aide, hy all our
industry, to find out where it was. This
forced us to Make, some port, and my
partner, who knew the country better
than I did, directed the captain to
put into the river of Cambodia; for I
had made the English mate, one
Mr. Thompson, captain, not being
witling to take the charge of the ship
upon mvself. This river lies on the
north side of the great bay or gulf
which goes up to Sinm. While we
were here, and going often on shore
for refreshment, {here comes to me
one day an Englishman, and he was, it
seems, a guniicrVmate on board an
English East India- ship which rode in
the same river, up at or near the city
of Cambodia; what brought him hither
we knew not; hut lie conies to me, and
speaking English, J>ir, .says lie, you are
a stranger to me, and J to yon, but I
have «omcfhing to tell you that very
nearly concerns you.
I looked steadfastly at htm a good
while, and thought at fis>t 1 km\ known
him, hut 1 did not: If it very nearly
concerns me, .said 1% and not yourself,
what moves you to tell it to* me?—I
am moved, says he, by the imminent
danger you are in, and, for aught J
see, yow have no knowledge of it—I
know no danger 1 am in, "says I, but
that, ray ship m leaky, aid 1 cannot find
it out j but I intend to lay her aground
to-morrow, to me if 1 can find it.—
But, fir, says he, leaky or not leaky,
find it or not find it, yon will be wiser
than to lay your ship on shore to-mor-
row, when you hear what I have to say
to you: do yon know, sir, said he, the
town of Cambodia lies about fifteen
leagues up this' river? and there art;
two large English ships about five
leagues on this side, and three Dutch.
—-Well, said I, and what is that to me?
-—Why, fc'.r, said he, is it. for a man
that is upon mtvh adventures a?* yon
are, lo come into a port and not exa-
mine first what ships there are there, and
whether he is able to deal with them*
f suppose yon do not think you are a
match for them ?- 1 was amused very
much at his discourse, hut not amazed
at it, for 1 could not conceive what he
meant; and I turned short upon him,
and raid, Sir, 1 wish you would explain
yourself; I cannot imagine what rea-
son 1 have to he afraid of any of the
Company's ships, or Dutch ships: I
am no interpoler; what can they have
to my to me? He looked like a man
half angry and half pleased, and pausing
awhile,'hut smiling, Well, sir, says he,
if you think yourself secure, you must
take your chance; 1 am sorry your
fate should blind you agahist good ad-
vice; but assure yourself. If you do not
put to *c:i immediately, you will the
very next tide be attacked by live long-
boats full of men, «nd perhaps, if you
are taken, you will be hanged for a pi-
rate, and the particulars he examined

I should have met with a better recep-
tion than this, for doing you a piece of
service of . such importance.—I can
never lie ungrateful, said I, for any ser-
vice, or to any man that offers me any
kindness; but it is past; my compre-
hension what they should have such a
design upon mo for: however, since
you say there is no time to be losti and
that there is some villainous design on
hand against me, 1 will go cut board
this minute, and put to sea immediately,
if my men can stop the leak, or if; we
• can swim without stopping'it: but, sir,
said I, shall I go away ignorant of the
cause of all this? Can yott give me-no
further light info it?*—I *tm fell you

Ammtmws op
 
I have a Dutch seaman here with me,
and 1 believe 1 could persuade him to
tell you the rest; hut there is scarce
time for it: hut the short of the story
is this, the first part 'of which, 1 sup-
pose, you know well enough, viz. that
you was with this ship at Sumatra; that
there your captain was murdered hy
the Malays, with three of hia men;
and that you, or some of those that
were on hoard with you, ran away
with the ship, and are since turned pi-
rates. This is the sum of the story,
and you will all lie seized as pirates, I
can assure, and executed with very
little ceremony; for you know mer-
chant ships show hut little hw to pi-
rates, if they get them into their power,
—Now you speak plain English, said
1, and 1 thank you; and though 1 know
nothing that we have done like what
you talk of, for ! am sure we came ho-
nestly and fairly hy the ship; yet see-
ing such a work is doing, as you say,
and that you *ccm to mean honestly, 1
will he upon my guard,—Nay, sir, says
lie, do not talk of being upon your
guard; the best defence is, to he out of
the danger 5 if yon have any regard for
your life, and the lives of all your men,
put to sea, without fail, at high water;
and as you have a whole tide before
you, yott will be gone too far out be-
fore they can come clown; for they will
come' away at high water, and as they
have twenty miles to come, you will
get near two hours of them by the
difference of the tide, not reckoning the
length of the way; besides, as they are
only boats, and not ships, they will not
venture to follow you far out to sea,
especially if it blows*—Well, said I,-
you have been very kind in this; what
shall I do tor you to make you amends >
—Sir, says lie, you may not be willing
to make me any amends, because you
may not be convinced of the truth of
it": 1 will make an offer to you; 1 have
nineteen months* pay due to me on
board'the ship ***, which t came out
of England m; and the Dutchman that
ia'with. irie has seven months' pay clue
to 'him; if you will make good our pay
to tig, we will go along with you: if
you fed nothing more in it, we will de-
sire' id' more $ but if we do convince
yok that we have saved your lives, and
the ship, and the lives of all the men
in her, we will leave the rest to you.
I consented to this readily, and went
immediately on board, and the two men
with me. As soon m I came to the
shtp*s side, my partner, who was on
board, came out on the quarter-deck,
and called to me, with a great deal of
joy, O ho! O ho I we have stopped, the
leak! we have stopped the leak!—Say
youso? said I, thank God; but weigh
anchor then immediately.—Weigh! &ays
lie; what do mean by that? What "k
the matter?—-Ask no questions, said 1 _;
but all hands to work, and weigh with-
out losing a minute. He was" surpri-
sed, but, however, lie called the cap-
tain, and he immediately ordered the
anchor to be got up; and though the
tide was not quite down, yet a little
land-breeze blowing, we stood out to
sea. Then 1 called him into the cabin,
and told him the story; and we called
in the men, and they told us the rest of
it; but as it took up u great deal of
time, before we had done a seaman
comes to the cabin-door, and called
out to us that the captain bade him
tell us we were chased. Chased! says
I j by what?—By five sloops, or boats,
says the feilowj full of men.—Very
well, said 1; then it i? apparent there is
something in it. In the next place 1
ordered all our men to be called up,
and told them there was a design to
seize the ship, and to take us' for pi-
rates, and asked them if they would
stand by us, and by one another; the
men answered cheerfully, one and all,
that they would live and die' with us.
Then 1 asked the, captain what way he
thought best for us to manage a fight
with them; for resist them I was re-
solved, we would, and that to the last
drop. He said readily that the way
was lo keep them off with our great
shot as long as we could, and then to
fire at them with our small arms, to
keep them from boarding us; but
when neither of these would do.'any
longer, we should retire to our close
quarters; perhaps they had not mate-
rials to break open our'bulk-heads, or
get In upon us.
The gunner had, in the mean time
orders to bring two guns to bear fore
and aft, out of the steerage, to clear
KUBINSON i'itUSOfl

the deck, and load them with musket-
bullets and mimII pieces of tiki iron,
and what came next to hand; and
thus we made ready For fight: but all
this while we kept out to sea, with
wind enough, and could see the boats
at a distance, hying five large long-
boats, following us with all the sail
they could make.
Two of those boats (which by our
glasses we could see were English)
out-sailed the rest, were near two
leagues a-hend of them, and gained
upon us considerably, so that we
found they would come up with us»;
upon which we fired a gnu without
ball to iutimatc that they should bring
to; and we put out a flag of truce, as
"a signal for parley; but they came
crowding* after us, till they came
within shot, when we took in our white
flag*, they having made no answer to
it, and hung out a red lag, and fired
at them with a shot. Notwithstand-
ing this, they came on till they were
near enough to call to them with a
speaking-trumpet which we had on
board; so we called to them, and
bade them keep off, at their peril.
It was all one; they crowded after
us, and endeavoured to come under
our stern, so as to board us on our
quarter: upon which, seeing they
were resolute for mischief, and de-
pended upon the strength that fol-
lowed them, I ordered to bring the
ship to, so that they lay upon our
broadside; when immediately we fired
five guns at them, one of which had
been levelled so true as to carry away
the stern of the hindermost boat,
and bring them to the necessity of
taking down their sail, and running
all to'the head of the boat to keep her
from sinking; so she lay by, and bad
eaougb of it; but seeing the foremost
boat crowd on after us, we made ready
to ire at her in particular. While
this was doing, one of the three boats
that was behind, being forwarder than
the other two, made up to the boat
which we had disabled, to relieve her,
and we could see her take out the
wen: we called again to the fore-
most boat, and offered a truce, to
parley again, and to know what her
business was with us; but had no
answer, only she crowded close un-
der our stern Upon this our gitti-
ner, who was a very dexterous fellow,
run out liu two chase-guns, and fired
again at her, but the shot juksiug,
the men in the boat shouted,, waved
their caps, mid came on; but the
gunner, getting quickly ready again,
tired among tltettt a second time, one.
shot of which, though it,misled the
boat itself, yet fell in among the men,
and we could easily see bad done a
great deal of mischief among them;
but we took no notice of that, wore
the ship a<rain, and brought our quar-
ter to bear upon them, and tiring«
three guns* more, we found the boat
wm almost split to pieces; in parti-
cular, her rudder and a piece of her
stern was shot quite away; so they
handed her sail immediately, and
were in great disorder. But to com-
plete their misfortune, our gunner let
fly two guns at them again; where
he hit them we could not tell, but we
found the boat was sinking, and some
of the men already in the water: upon
this ! immediately manned out our
pinnace, which we had kept close by
our side, with orders to pick up some
of the men, if they could, and save
them from drowning, and immedi-
ately come on board the ship with
them, because we saw the rest of the
boats began to come up. Our men in
the pinnace followed their orders, and
took up three men, one of whom
was just drowning, and It was a good
while before we could recover Mir.
As soon as they were on board, we
crowded all the sail we could make,
and stood farther out to sea; and we
found that when the other three boats
came up to the first, they gave over
their chase.
Being thus delivered from a dan-
ger, which, though 1 knew not the
reason of it, yet seemed to be much
greater than! apprehended^ 1 resglved
that we should change our course,
not let any one 'know whither we
were going: so we stood out to sea
eastward, quite out of the cou:«e 'of
all European ships, whether they were
bound to China or any where else within
the commerce of the European nation?.
When we were at sea, ,w« begap to
ADVENTURES OF
 
consult with the two seamen, and In-
quire what the meaning of all this
should ho-; an<! the Dutchman let m
into the secret at once, telling' m that
the fellow that sold m the shijs as
we said, was no more than a thief,
that hud run away with her. Then he
told us how the captain, whose name
too he told its, though I do not re-
member it now, was treacherously
murdered by the natives on the coast
of Malacca," with three of his men;
mid that he, this Dutchman, and four
more, got into the woods, where they
wandered about a great while, till at
length he, in particular, in a mira-
culous manner, made his escape, and
swam off" to a Dutch ship, which,
sailing near the shore in its way from
China, had sent their boat on shore
fur fresh water; that he durst not
come to that part of the shore where
the boat was, but made ?hift in the
inght to take the water farther off,
atitl swimming a great while, at last
the shin's boat took him up.
He then told us that he went to
Batavja, where two of the seamen
belonging to the ship arrived, having1
deserted' the rest in their travels, and
gave an account that the fellow who
had run away with the ship sold her
at Bengal to* a set of pirates, which
were gone a cruising in her; and that
they 'had already 'taken an English
ship and two Dutili ships very richly
laden.
This latter part was found to con-
cern us directly, though we knew it
to be false: yet, 'as my partner said
very justly, if we had fallen into their
hands, aiid they-had had such a pre-
possession against us beforehand, it
had been in" vain for us to have de-
fended ourselves, or to hope for any
good 'quarter at their hands; and es-
pecially considering that our accusers
had been our judges, and that we
could have expected nothing from
them but what rage would have dic-
tated, and an ungoverned passion hare
executed; and therefore it was his
opinion we should go directly back
to' Bengal, from whence we came,
without'putting in at any port what-
ever $ because''there we could give' a
good account of ourselves, could
prove where we were when (he ship
put in, of whom we bought her,
and the like; and, which was more
than all the rest, if we were put upon
the neccsMty of bringing it before the
proper judges, we should be sure to
have some justice, and not to be
hanged first and judged afterwards.
'1 was some time of my partner's
opinion; but after a little more serious
thinking, i rokl him 1 thought it was a
very great hazard for us to attempt re-
turning to Bengal, for that we were on
the wrong side of the Straits of Ma-
lacca, and that if the alarm was given,
we should he sure to be way-laid on
every side, as well by the Dutch of Ba-
tavia as the English elsewhere; that if
we should be taken, as it were, run-
ning away, we should even condemn
ourselves, nmt there would wont no
more evidence to destroy us, J also
asked the English sailor's opinion, who
said fie was of-my mind, and that we
should certainly be taken. This dan-
ger a little startled my partner, and all
the ship's company, and we imme-
diately resolved to go away to the coast;
of Tonquin, and so on to the coast of
China; and, pursuing the first design
as to trade, find some way or other to
dispose of the ship, and come back in
some of the vessels of the country,
such as we could get. This was ap-
proved of as the best method for our
security; and accordingly we steered
away N. N. E. keeping above fifty
leagues off* from the usual course to
the eastward. This, however, put us
to some inconvenience; for, first, the
winds, when we came to that distance
from the Shore, seemed to be more
steadily against us, blowing almost
trade, as we call it, from the E, and
E. N. E. so that we were a long while
upon our voyage, and we were but ill
provided with" victuals for so long a
run; and, which was still worse, there
was some danger that those English
aid Dutch ships, whose boats pursued
us, whereof some were bound that
way, might be got in before us, and if
not some other ship bound to China
might have information of us fromthem,
and pursue us with the'same vigour.
1 must confess, 1 was now very un-
easy, and thought myself, including the
late escape from the long-boats, to
have been in the most dangerous con-
dition, that ever I was through my past
life; for whatever ill circumstanced I
had been in, 1 was never pursued for a
thief before; nor hud i ever done any
tiling that merited the name of disho-
nest* or fraudulent, much less thievish;
I had chiefly been my own enemy, or,
as 1 may rihtly say, 1 have been no-
budv's enemy but my own; hut now 1
was embarrassed in the worst condition
imaginable; fur though 1 wtn perfect-
ly innocent, I way in no condition to
make that innocence npp«\ir; and if i
had been taken, it ha.I been under a
supposed guilt of the worst kind.
This made me very anxious to make
an escape, though which way to do it"
1 knew not, or what port or place we
could go to. My partner seeing me
thus dejected, though lie was the most
concerned at iir.sf, began to encourage
me, and describing to me the several
ports of that coast, told trie he would
put iti on the coast of Cochin China, or
the hay of Tonquiu, intending to go
afterwards to Mac^o, a town once in
possession of the Portuguese, and
where still a great many European fa-
milies resided; and particularly the
missionary priests usually went thi-
ther, in order to their going forward
to China.
Hither then we resolved to go; ami
accordingly, though after a tedious and
irregular course, and vry much strai-
tened for provisions, we came within
sight .of the coast very early in the
morning; and upon reflection on the
past circumstances we were in, and the
danger if we had not escaped, we re-
solved to put into a small 'river, which,
however, had depth enough of water
for us, and to see if we could, either
overland or by the ship's pinnace, come
to know what ships were in any port
thereabouts. This happy step was,
indeed, our deliverance, for though
we did not immediately see any Euro-
pean ships in the bay of Tonquin, yet
the next morning' there came into the
bay two Butch ships; and a third, with-
out any colours spread out, but which
we believed to be a Dutchman, passed
by at about two leagues* distance, steer-
ing for the coa&t of China; awl in the
afternoon went by two English ships
Hearing the same eonr.se; and thus we
thought we saw ourselves beset, with
enemies both one way and the other.,.
The place we were in wm wild and
barbarous; the people thieves, even by
occupation or profession; and though,
it is true, we had. not much to seek d£
them, and except #eltin# a few provi*
skins, eared not how little we had to do
with thrui, yet it was 'with much diffi-
culty that we kept ourselves from
being insulted by them several ways.
We were in a small river of this coun-
try, within a few leagues of its utmost
limits northward; and by our boat we
coasted north-cant, to the point of land
which opens the great bay of Tonquin;
and it was in this beating up along the
snore that wo discovered we were sur-
rounded with enemies. The people
we were among were the moat J>arba-
rotts of all the inhabitants of the coast,
having no correspondence with any
other nation, and dealing only in fish-
oil, and such gross commodities; and
it may be particularly seen that'they
are the  most uarbanms of any of the
inhabitants, Among* oilier customs
they have this one, viz. that if any ves-
sel has the misfortune to be ship-
wrecked upon their coast, they pre-
sently make the men all prisoners or
slaves; and it was not long before we
found a piece of their kindness this
way, on the occasion following*.
1 have observed above, that our ship
sprang a leak at sea, and that we could
not find it out; and it happened that,
as 1 have said, it was stopped unex-
pectedly, in the happy minute of our
being to be seized by the Dutch and
English ships in the bay of Siam; yet
as we did not find the ship so perfectly
tight and sound as we desired, we re-
solved, while we were at this place, to
lay her on shore, and take out what
heavy things we had on board, and
clean her bottom; and, if possible, to
find out where the leaks were. Ac-
cordingly, having lightened the ship,
and'brought all' our guns and other
moveables to one side, we tried to
, bring her down, that we might come at
her bottom$ but, on. second thoughte,

ADVENTURE* OF
would let fly among thcin, i called
'back 'again to him, and bid him not
.offer to fire, Tut' the carpenter would
clothe \iorh without him; but bid him
heal another pitch keltic, which our
cook, who was on board, took cure of:
full- the enemy whs so terrified with
What they had met with in their first
attack, that they would not come on
again | and some of them who were
farthest off, seeing the ship swim, as it
were, upright, began, as we suppose, to
see their mistake, and give over the
enterprise, finding it was not as they
expected. Thus we got clear of this
merry fight, and having got some rice
and some roots and bread, with about
sixteen hogs on board, two days befote,
we resolved to stay here no longer, but
go forward, whatever came of it; for
we made no doubt but we should be
surrounded the next day with rogues
enough, perhaps more than our piteh-
Icettle would dispose of for us. We
therefore'got all our things on board
the same evening, and the next morn-
ing were ready to sail: in the mean
time, lying at anchor at some distance
from the shore, we were not so iniich
concerned,' being now in a fighting
posture, as well as in a sailing posture,
if any enemy had presented. The next
day, having finished our work within
board, and finding our ship was perfect-
ly healed of all her leaks, we set sail.
tVe would have gone into the bay of
Tonquiu,for we wanted to inform our-
selves of what was to be known con-
cerning the Dutch ships that had been
'there; but we durst not stand in there,
because we had seen several ships go
in, as we supposed, but a little before;
so we kept on N.E. towards the island
of Formosa, as much afraid of being
seen by a Dutch or English merchant
ship, as a Dutch or English merchant
ship 'in the Mediterranean is of an Al-
geririe man of war.,
''.When we were thus got to sea, we
'kept on N. E, as if we would go to the
'Manillas.or the Philippine islands, and
this we'did that we niight not fall into
\ the, way, of any of the European, ships;
an^T't^n we steered north, till we came
>to',tlie''iatinide of 22 cleg, 30 min. by
.which means we made th^ island of For-
mosa directly * -where we came to an
anchor, in order to get water and fresh
provisions, which the people there, who
are very courteous .and civil in their
manners, supplied us with willingly,
and dealt very fairly and punctually
with tis in all their agreements and bar-
gains, which is what we did not find
among other people, and may he owing
to the remains of Christianity which
was once planted here by a Dutch
missionarv of protestants, and is a tes-
timony ot what I have often observed,
viz. that the christian religion always
civilizes the people and .rctorms their
manners, where it is received, whether
it works saving effects upon them or no.
From thence we sailed still north,
keeping the coast of China aC an equal
distance, till we knew we were beyond
all the ports of China where our'Eu-
ropean ships usually come; being re-
solved, if possible, not to fall into any
of their hands, especially in this coun-
try: where, as our circumstances were,
we could not fail of being entirely rtiiiicd.
Being now come to the latitude of
thirty degrees, we resolved to put into
the first trading port we should come
at; and standing'in'for the shore, a
boat came off two leagues to us, with
an old Portuguese pilot'on board, who
knowing us to be an European ship,
came to oiler his service, which, in-
deed, we wore glad of, and took hini
on board; upon which, without asking
us wrhither we would go, he dismissed
the boat he came in, and sent it back.
1 thought it was now so much in our
choice to make the old man carry us
whither we would, that 1 began to talk
to him about carrying us to the gulf of
Nanquin, which is the most northern
part of the coast of China. The
old man said he knew the gulf of
Nanquin very well, but smiling, asked
its what we would do. there I 1 told, him
we would sell our cargo and purchase
China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea,
wrought silks, &c. and so would return
by the same course we came.  He. told
lis our best port had been to have put
in at Macao, where -we could not bave
failed of a market for our opium  to
.our satisfaction,, and might for our
money have purchased'all sorts "of
China goods' as chetp ss we could at
Nanquin,
 
 
fit
 
 
Not being able to put the old man
out of Ills talk, of which he was very
opinionated or conceited. 1 told him
we were gentlemen us weli us mer-
chant*, and that we had a_ mind to go
and see the great city of Peking, and
the famous court of the monarch of*
China, Why then* says the old man,
yon jdiould go to Ningpo, where, by
tfi»» river which runs into the sea there,
you may go up within live leagues of
the great'ennui This canal is a navi-
gable stream, which goes through the
'heart of that vn-d empire of China,
crones all the rivers, pa-^c* some con-
siderable hills, by fke help of sluices
and jfut.es, and goes up to the city
of Peking, being in length near two
hundred and seventy league*.
Well, said f» seignior Portuguese,
but that is not oiii* business now; the
great question is, if yon can curry ns
up to the city of Nanquin, from whence
we can travel to Peking afterwards?
Ife said we could do m very well, and
that there wits a great Dutch ship
gone up that way just before. Tim
gave me a little'shock, for a Dutch
ship wm now our terror, und we had
much rather have met the devil, at
least if he had riot come in t >o fright-
ful a figure; and we depended upon it
that a "Dutch ship would be our de-
struction, for we were in no condition
to fight them; all the ships they trade
with into those parts being of great
burden, and of much greater force
than we were.
The old man found me a little con-
fused, and under some concern, when
lie named a Dutch ship; and said to
me, sir, you need be tinder no appre-
hensions of the Dutch; I suppose they
ire not now at* war with your nation?
—No, said 1, that's true; but 1 know
not what liberties men ma? take when
the? are out of the resell of the laws of
their own country.—Why,- says he, you
are no pirates;'what need yon fear?
They will not meddle with peaceable
merchants, sure.
If I had atiy.. blood in ray body that
lid not tf tip' into my face at that
word, it was hindered % some stop in
the ve?sds appointed by nature |.o cir-
culate It, fbr'it prit me into the greatest
disorder and confusion iiti%iiiabM -
nor was il possible for me to conedd it
so, bur the old man easily perceived ft.
Sir, says he, I find you are in some
disorder In your thoughts a! roy talk j
prav be pleaded if) go which way yon
think fit, and depend upon it, I'll do
you alt the service 1 can.—Why, self-
iiifir, said T, it is true, f am a little un-
settled in ray resolution at this time,
whither to srb in particular j audi am
something more so tor what you*said
about pirates. I hope there are no pirates
in these seas: we are hut in an ill condi-
tion to meet with them, for yon see we
have but a small force, and are but
very weakly manned.— 0, sir, says he,
don't be concerned, 1 do not know that
there have been any pirates in these
seas these fifteen years, except one,
which was seen, as" J 'hear, in the bay
of Stain, about a month since; hut
you may be assured she is gone to the
southward; nor wm she a snip of any
great; force, or tit for the work: she
was not built for a privateer, but was
run away with by a reprobate crew
that was'' on board, after the captain
and sonic of liis^neti had beeij mur-
dered by the Malayans, at or near the
Mand of Sumatra.—What! said I,
seeming to know nothing of the mat-
ter, did they murder the captain?-*
No, said he", I don't understand that
they murdered him; but as they after-
wards ran away with the ship, it is ge*
nerally believed that they betrayed him
into the hands of the Malayans, who
did murder him •, and perhaps they pro-
cured them to do it.—Why then, said I,
they deserve death m much as if they
had done it themselves.—Nay, says the
old man, they do deserve it ^ and they
will certainly "have it, If they light upob
any English or Dutch ship: for they
have all agreed together, that if tlief
meet that rogue they'll give Mm irt>
quarter.—Bui, said l to him, you say
the pirate is gone out of ttese seat;
how can the? meet with him then?—
Whv, thaPs true, says he, they do sty
so; "but he was, m I tell yoa, in tfte
bay of Siam, in the river Cambodii?
and was discovered there' by sows
Dutchmen who belonged to the*'4h!]j^
and who were left on shore whepf fHef

ilig only two boats within reach of him,
tacked'about, and fired at those.two,
and disabled them before the others
came up, and then standing off to sea,
the others were not able to follow, and
so he got away; but they hate all so
exact a, description of the ship, that
they will be sure to know her; and
wherever they find her they bate vowed
to gi?e no quarter either to the captain
or seamen, but to hang them-all tip at
the yard*arm.—What! said J» will they
execute ,them right or wrong; hang
them first, and judge them afterwards?
—0 sir, says the old pilot, there is no
need to make a formal business of it
with swell rogues as those; let them
tie them back to back, and set them
airing. His no more than they de-
»erve.
1 Knew 1 had my old man fast on
board, and that he could do no harm,
so that 1 turned abort upon him: Well
»ow» seignior, said I, this is the ¥ery
reason why 1 would have you carry us
up to Manquin, and not put back to
Macao, or to any other part of the
country where the English or Dutch
ships come'; for be it known to you,
seignior, those captains of the English
an! Dutch ships are a parcel of rash,
eroud, insolent fellows, that neither
now what belong* to justice, or how
tO' behave themselves as the laws of
QM ,and nature direct; but being
proud of their, offices, and not under-
standing their power, they would act
the, »urderers, to punish^ robbers $
would take upon them to insult men

laps 1 may life to bring some of them
to account for it, when they may be

.. - Willi, till I..told: Mm  that. tbi* was
Dm very-ship they attacked, and gave
Mat« lull ftccount of the skirmlw we
bftd.-wkb-their boats, and, how foolishly
tai cmninfl?-liifty:bebftv6d. I toM
him all the story < of, ©or buying the
ship, and how the Dutchman served us,
I told him the reasons I had to believe
the story of killing the master by the
Malayans was true, as also the running
away with the ship; but it was all a
fiction of their own to suggest that the
men had turned pirates, and they
ought to have been sure it was, so be-
fore they had featured to attack us by
surprise, and oblige us to resist them;
adding, that the? would have the blood
of those men, whom we killed there k
just defence to answer for.
The old man was amazed at tub re-
lation, and told us we were very much,
in the right to go away^ to the north;
and that.if he might advise us, it should
be to sell the ship in China, which we
might very well do, and buy or build
another in the country; and, said, he,
though you will not get so good a
ship, yet you may get one able enough
to carry you and all your goods back
again to Bengal, or any where eke. I
told him I would take his advice when
1 came to any port where 1 could find
a ship for my turn, or get, any custo-
mer to buy this. He replied, 1 should
meet with customers enough for, the
ship at Nanquin, and that a Chinese
junlk would serve me very well to go
back again; and that he would pro-
cure me people both to buy one and
sell the other. Well.but, seignior,
said I, as you say they know the ship
so well, 1 may, perhaps, if ! follow'
vour measures, be instrumental to
bring some honest innocent men into.a
terrible broil, and perhaps to be mur-
dered in cold blood; for wherever they_
find the ship, they will prove the guilt
upon the men, by proving this was the
ship, and so innocent men may pro-
bably be overpowered and murdered
—-Why, says.the old man, Fli find out
a' way to , prevent that also; for as 1
know all those commanders, you speak
of v^ry. well, and shall see them all as
they'pftts by, 1 will be sure to set them
to fights In the thing, apd, tet.theni
knbw that they had been so much in
the wrong; that though the people
who were op hoard, at first, mignt p®
away with the ship, yet it was not true
that they had turned pirates j apd that,
in .particular, these rw$re not the mea

ttttit ftrsf went off with the ship, but in-
ntteentty bought tier for their trade;
and I am persuaded they will m far lie*
lieve me, as at least to act more can*
lions! y for the time to come.
While these firings'were passing be-
tween us, 'by way of discourse', we
went forward*directly for Nanquin, awl
in about thirteen days' sail came to an
anchor at the south-west point of the
great gulf of Nan (pi hi; where, by the
way, 1 came by accident to understand
that two Dutch ships were gone the
length before me, and that I should
certainly full into their hands, I eon-
stilted in? partner again in litis ext*
gency, arid fie was as much at a loss
is I was, and would very gladly have
been safe on shore almost any where:
however, 1 was not in such perplexity
neither, but 1 asked the old pilot If
there was no creek or harbour which I
might put into and pursue my business
with the Chinese privately, and lie in
no danger of the enemy, tie told ine,
if I would sail to the southward about
forty-two leagues, there was a little
port called  Qninchang, where the
fathers of the mission usually landed
from Bla?ao, on their progress'to teach
tie Christian religion to the Chinese,
and where no European ships ever put
io; and if 1 thought to put in there, 1
might consider what farther course to
take when I was on shore. He con-
fessed, he said, It %vas not a place for
merchants, except that at some certain
times they had a kind of a fair there,
when the merchctvH from Japan came
over thither to buy the Chinese mer-
chandiscs.
'We all agreed to go back to this
place; the name of the port, as he
called it, 1 may perhaps spell wrong,
for 1 io mat particularly remember it,
baring lost this, together with the
names of many other places set down in
a little pocket-book, which was spoiled
by tie water by an accident; but this 1
remember, that the Chinese or Japa-
nese merchants we corresponded with,

which; oar' Portuguese1-pilot gave it,

HOMn'togO'tothit^ace, we weighed
the next day, having oily gone twice
on shore where wte were to g«t freih

people of the country were' wry ctvilto
li*, and brought m abundance of "tlilrtgi
to sell to iis, J mean of provhriotif,
phtnts, roots«, ten, rice, and ''boibo
fowls, but nothing without money. • •
 We came to the other port" (tlii
wind being contrary) nottill five daytt
but it was very much to our satisfac*
tiori; and I was joyful, and J may
say thankful, when 1 set my  foot
on shore, resolving, and my partner
too,- that if it was possible to dis-
pose of ourselves and effects any other
way, though not every way to our ss»
tisfaction/we would never set one foot
on boatel that unhappy vessel more;
and, indeed, 1 must acknowledge, that
of all the circumstances of life that
ever 1 hud any experience of, nothing
makes itiknkind so completely inise*
rable as that of being in constant fear.
Well does the Scripture say, "The
fear of man brings a snare j" it is a life
of death, and the mind is so entirely
oppressed by it, that it is capable of no
relief.
Nor did it fall of its usual operations'
upon the fancy, by heightening every
danger, representing the English ana
Dutch captains to be men incapi b e of
hearing reason, or of distinguishing
between honest men and rogues; or
between a story calculated for our own
turn, made out of nothing, on purpose
to deceive, and a true genuine account
of our whole voyage, progress, and de*
sign; for we might many ways have
convinced any reasonable creature that
we were not pirates; the goods we had
on board, the course we steered, otir
frankly showing ourselves, and enter-'
ing into such and such ports; and even
our very manner, the force we had, 'the
number of men, the few arms, little
ammunition, short provisions; all these
would have served to convince any
men that we were no pirutet*  Th»

ADVENTURES OF
 
tilt two Dutchmen on board* These,
wid many other particular circum-
stances, might have made it evident to
the understanding of any commander,
whose hoods we might tall into, that
we were no pirate?. But fe«t'*\ that
blind, useless passion, worked another
way,.and threw us into the vapours*, it
bewildered our understandings, and set
the imagination at work to form a
thousand terrible thing's that perhaps
might never happen. We first sup-
posed, as indeed every body had rela-
ted to uk, that the seamen on board
the'English and Dutch ships, but espe-
cially the Dutch, were so enraged at
the name, of a pirate, antl especially at
our beating off their boats and escap-
ing, that they would not irive them-
selves leave to inquire 'whether we
were pirates or no; but would execute
us off hand, as we call it, without
giving iw any room for a defence. We
reflected that there really was so much
apparent evidence before them, that
they would scarce inquire after any
more; as, first, that the ship was cer-
tainly the same, and that some of the
seamen among them knew her, and had
been on board her; and, secondly, that
when we had intelligence at the river
of Cambodia that they were coming
'down; to examine us, we fought their
-boats and tied; so that we made no
doubt but they were as fully satisfied
of our being pirates, as we were satis-
fied of the contrary; and, as I often
said, I know not but I should have
been apt to have taken those circum-
stances for evidence, if the tables were
turned, and my ease was theirs; and
have made no sciuple in cutting all the
crew to pieces, without believing, or
ferhaps considering, what they might
ave to offer in their defence.
 But let I hat be how it will, these
were our apprehensions; mu both my
partner and 1. scarce slept a night
without dreaming of halters and yard-
arms, that is to gay, gibbets 5 of fight-
ing, and being taken; of killing, and
'being lei Heel: and one night 1 was in
such a fury in my dream, fancying the
Dutchmen had boarded us, and 1 was
'knocking one of their seamen down,
::&aj;, I,struck- toy double;i§t against the
•:^fe;Of' the catpp 1 •% ia-with gutgrB
force, as wounded my hand grievously,
broke my knuckles, and cut and
bruised the flesh, so that it awaked me
o?|t of my sleep.
Another apprehension 1 had was,
the cruei ir-wge we might, meet with
from them if we fell into their uands:
then the story of Amboyna came into
my head, and how the Dutch might per-
haps torture us, as they did our coun-
trymen tncre, a:^1 make some of our
men, by extremity of torture, confess
those crimes they never were guilty of,
or own themselves and all of us to be pi-
rates, and so itiiw would put us to death
with a formal appearance of justice;
and that they might be tempted to do
thi? for the gain of our ship and cargo,
which was worth four or five thousand
pounds, put all tog-ether.
These things tormented me and my
partner too, night ami day; nor did
we consider that the captains of ships
have no authority to act thus; and if
we had surrendered prisoners to them,
they could not answer the destroying
us, or torturing 11s, but would lie ac-
countable for it when they came to
their own country; this, 1 say, gave
ine no satisfaction; for if they were to
act thus with us, what advantage would
it be to us that they should be called
to an account for it? or if we were
first to be murdered, what satisfaction
would it be to us to have them punished
when they came home?
1 cannot refrain taking notice here
what reflections I now had upon the
vast variety of my particular circum-
stances; how hard 1 thought it was,
that I, who had spent forty years in a life
of continual difficulties, and was at last
come, as it were, to the port or haven
which all men drive at, viz. to Lave
rest and plenty, should be a volunteer
in new sorrows by my own unhappy
choice; and that I, who had escaped
so many dangers in my youth, should
now come to be hange'd in my old age,
and in so remote a place, for a crime
which 1 was not in the least inclined
to, much less guilty of.
After these "thoughts, something of
religion would come in; and 1 should
be considering that this seemed to me to
.be a disposition, of immediate Pfwi-
depce, aa4i oijgbjtto/lojt^ «pp it-sad
 
submit to- it as suck f that although I
was innocent as to wen, 1 was far from
being innocent as to my Maker; and 1
ought to look in and examine what other
crimes in my Till1 were most obvious to
me, and for which Providence might
justly inflict this punishment as n re-
tribution; nod tlilit 1 ought to submit
to this, just as 1 would to a shipwreck,
if it bus! pleaded God to have brought
such a disaster upon jr«c.
In its turn, natural courage would
sometimes take its place, ami then 1
would be talking* myself up to vigorous
resolutions; that I would not be taken
to be barbarously used by a, parcel of
merciless wretches in cold blood; that
it were much better to have fallen
into the bands of the savages, though
1 was sure they would feast upon me
when they had taken me, than those
who would perhaps glut I heir rae;e
upon rue by inhuman tortures and
barbarities; that in the case of the
savages I always resolved to die fighting
to the last gasp, and why should J
not do so now, seeing it was much
more dreadful, to me at least, to think
of foiling into these men's hands, than
ever it was to think of being eaten by
men? for the savages, give them their
due, would not eat a man till lie was
killed and dead, but that these men
had many arte beyond the cruelty of
death. Whenever these thoughts
prevailed, I was sure to put myself
into a kind of fever with the agita-
tion of a supposed fight; my blood
would boil, and my eyes sparkle, as
if 1 was engaged, and 1 always resolv- .
ed to take no quarter at their bauds;
but, even at last, if I could resist no
longer, 1 would blow up the ship and
1 all that was in her, and leave them
but little booty to boast of.
The greater weight the anxieties and
perplexities of these things were to
our thoughts while we were at sea, the
greater was our satisfaction when we
saw ourselves on shore; and my part-
ner told me lie 'dreamed that he bad
a very heavy dead upon his back,
which,he was to carry up a hill, and
fetifvj that lie was not able to stand
longer under it.; but that .the Portu-
guese pilot came and took it off his
• taek^and -the Mil --disappeared the
ground before « him , appearing til
smooth and plain; and truly it was so $
they were all like men who had a
load taken oif their backs,' For tny-
pari, 1 had a weight taken off from
my heart thai it was not able any
longer to bear; and, us 1 said altove,
we resolved lo go no more to sen in
that ship. When we came on shore,
the obi pilot, who was now our friend,
got us a lodging* and. a warehouse for
our goods, which, by the way, was
much the same: it was a ii'tle house*
or hut, with a larger house adjoining'
to if, all built with canes, and pali§*
aducd round with large caucs, to keep
out pilfering thieve?-, of which it seems,
there were not a few in that country j
however, the magistrates allowed m
a little guard, and we had a soldier
with a kind of halberd, or half-pike,
who stood sentinel at our door, to
whom we allowed a pint of ries, and
a little piece of money, about the
value of threepence, per day, so that
our goods were kept very safe.
The fair, or wait, usually kept in
this place, had been over some time;
however, we found that there were
three or four junks in the river, and
two Japanera, 1 mean ships from
Japan, with goods which they had
bought in China, and were not gone
away, having some Japanese merchants
on shore.
The first thing our old Portuguese
pilot did for us was, i.oget us acquaint*
ed with three missionary Romish
Priests who were in town, and who
had been there some time converting
the people to Christianity; but we
thought they made but poor work of
it, and made them but sorry Chris-
tians, when they had done; however,
that was none of our business. One
of these wits a Frenchman, whom
they called Father Simon: another
was a Portuguese, and the third a
Genoese,; but Fattier Simon  was
courteous,-easy in his manner, and very
agreeable company; the other two
were more reserved, seemed rigid and
austere, arid applied seriously to the
work they came about, viz. to- talk
with, and insinuate themselves among
the-., inhabitants, wherever -, they Mm

with thaae men | and  though, I* must
confesi, the conversion, as< they call It* -
of. the; Chinese to Christianity is so far
ironr the'true conversion required 'to
toring. heathen people to the faith .of
Christ j that it  seems to amount to
little in ore than, letting them know the
name of Christy and say some prayers
to'the Virgin Mary and her Son, in a
tongue  which' they understand not,
and to cross themselves,' and the like;
yet it mast lie confessed-that the reli-
gionists, whom we;call missionaries,
have a- firm  belief that these people
will'be- saved* and that they are the
instruments of it; and, on this accont,
they undergo not only the fatigue ^ of
the.voyage, and the hazards of living
ill' such "places, - but oftentimes death
itself, with the most violent tortures,
for the sake of this work.
 .;But to return to my story: Tins
French priest. Father Simon,"was ap-
pointed, it seems, by order of the chief
of the mission, to go up to Peking, the
royal «eat of the Chinese emperor, and
waited only, for another priest, who
was ordered to come to him from Ma-
cao, to go along with himj and we
scarce ever met together but he was
inviting me to go that jonrne?;  telling
me how he would shorn- me all the glo-
rious things of that mighty empire,
and, among the' rest, the greatest city
in the world; a city, said he, that your
IjOrtdon and our Paris put together,
cannot he equal to.  This was the city
of Peking,  which, 1 confess, is very
great, and infinitely full of people; but
as I looked on those things with dif-
ferent eyes from' other men, so I shall
•give my opinion: of them in a few
words, when :I come in the course of
my travels to speak more particularly
of them.' . '  . ''
But, first, I come to my friar or mis-
sionary. Dining with- liim one day,
and* 'being very merry together, I
flowed some little inclination to go
.with him; and,lie pressed me and my
partner.very hard, and with a grea't
many'persuasions, to consent. Why,
:'F*ther Simon, -says my partner, should
'you desire our company so. much I yon

says he; our religion does not divest
ns of good manners: besides, we arc
here like countrymen; and so we aref
compared to the place we are in\ and
if you are huguenots, and 1 a catholic,
we may all be 'Christians at testy at
leasts we are all gentlemen1,, and we
may converse so, without being' uneasy
to one another. 1 liked this part of
his discourse very well, .and it began to
put me in mind of-my priest that 1 had
left in the Brazils j but this, father Si*
mon did not come up to his character
by a great deal; for though Father Si-
mon had no appearance of a criminal
levity in htm neither, yet he had not
that'fund of Christian zeal, strict piety f
and sincere affection to religion, that
my other good ecclesiastic had.
But to leave him- a little, though he
never left us, nor soliciting us to go
with him; we had something eke he-
fore us at first, for we had all thie
while our ship and our merchandise' to*
dispose of, and we began to1 be very
doubtful what we should do, for we
were now in a place of very little busi-
ness; and once 1 was about to venture
to sail for the river of Kilam* and. the
city 'of Nanquin; but Providence
* seemed now more visibly, ml thought/
than ever, to concern  itself in our
affairs; and 1 was encouraged, from
this very time, to think 1 should one
. way or other get out of this entangled
'circumstance, and be brought home to
my own country again, though I. had
not the least view of .the manner,.
Providence, I say, began here to clear
up our way a little: and the first thing
that offered was, that, our old Portu-
guese pilot brought,, a Japan merchant
to us, who inquired what 'goods we
had; and, in the Irst place, he bought
all oar opium, and gave us a very good
..price' for it, paying us., in gold 'by
'Weight,'some in small'pieces-of their
own < coin* and some in small .wedges,

he- miirht perhaps- deal for1 the ship too,
and' 1 'Ordered the interpreter to pro-
pose it to liiih; tie shrunk up his
dhoulders at it, when It \%m first pro-
posed lo him; but In a few days after
lie came to me, with one of the mis*
tsionary priest* for Ms interpreter, and
told me he had a proposal to make to
me, which was this:—«he had bought a
great qnantity of goods of us, when lie
had no thoughts of proposals being
made to him~of buying the ship; and
that,therefore,he had not money enough
to pay for the ship: but if 1 would let
the same men'who were in the ship na-
vigate her, he would hire the ship to go
to Japan; and would send thern from
thence to the Philippine islands with
another loading, which he would pay
the freight of before they went from
Japan; and that at their return he
would buy the ship. I be'/an to listen
to his proposal* and so eager did my
head still ran upon rambling, that 1
could not but begin to entertain a no-
lion of going myself with-him, and so
to sail from the Philippine islands away
Co the South Seas; accordingly 1
asked the Japanese merchant if he
would not hire us to the Philippine
Islands, and discharge" us there. He
said» No, he could "not do that, for
then he could not have the return of
Ms cargo; but he would discharge us
in Japan, uat the ship's return. Well,
still 1 was for  taking him at that pro-
posal, and going myself; but my part-
ner, wiser than' myself, persuaded me
from It, representing the dangers, as
well of the seas as of the Japanese,
'who are a'false, cruel, and treacherous
people; likewise those of the Spaniards
'at the Philippines,  more false, cruel,
and treacherous, than they.
But to bring this long' turn of our
affairs to a conclusion: the irst thing
we had to do was, to consult with the
'captain of the ship, and with Ms men,
«nd know if they were willing t© go to
Japan; and while I was doing this, the
young man whom my nephew had left
-.with me as my com pinion for my tra-
-"Wts came to roe, and told me that he
thought that voyage promised very fair,
anoV'that there was. a great prosp'ect of

which really was considerable,' and till
he was a young fellow as likely tod©
well in it as any I knew, ! iuoliued to
let him go; but I told him I would
consult my partner, and give him an
answer the next day* • Mf partner anil
1 discoursed about it, and my partner
made a most generous offer: Yoti
know it has been an unlucky ship,
said he, and we both resolve not to go
to sea in it again; if your steward (so
he called my man) will venture the
voyage, i will leave my share of the
vessel to him, and let him make the
best of it; and if we live to meet In
England, and he meets with success
abroad, lie shall account for one" half
of the profits of the ihip's freight t®
us; the other shall be his own, 
If rny partner, who was no way eon*
cerned with my young man, made him
such an ofter, "1 could do no less than
offer liiffi the. jsjone: and- all the ship1!
company being willing logo with Mm,
we made over half the ship to'him ia

fan merchant proved a very punctual
onest man to him; protected 'him at
Japan, and got" him a: licence to com*
on shore, which  the Europeans In gei
neral have not lately obtained; pay
him his freight very punctually; tent
him to the Philippines, loaded with Js~
pan and China wares, and a supercargo
of their own, who, trafficking with the
Spaniards, brought back European
goods« again, and a great quantity of
cloves and other slices; and there1'he
was not only'paid-his freight very well,
and at a very good price, 'but not being

sold liis cargo very well. Here, having
got a- good acquaintance at Manilla, he
got Ms ship made a free ship; and the
governor of AJunilla hire! him to go to
Acapulco in America, on the count of
Mexico, and gave him a licence to
land there,and t»f travel to Mexico, and
to pass in aay Spanish ship lo Europe
with till ,his men. He made- the voyage
to Aeapuleo very happily, aud there lie
sold his .ship; iiiiil having there also
ohtaiued allowance to travel by hmd to
Porto Belio, lie found means, some-
how or oilier to get to Jamaica, with
all his treasure; and ahout eight years
after came.to Enghtnd exceeding rich,
of which I shall take notice in its
place; in the mean time, I return to
our particular aiikhs.
Being now to part with the ship and
ship's company, it came before us, of
course, to consider what reeompenee
we should give to the two men that
gave us such timely notice of the design
against us m the river Cambodia. The
truth whs, they had done us a very con-
siderable sen ice, and deserved well at
our hands; though,!*? the way, they were
a couple of rogues too; for as they be-
lieved the story of our being* pirates,
and tliat we had really run away with
the ship, they came down to us not
only to betray the design that was
formed against us, but to go to sea
with us us pirates; and one of thera
confessed afterwards that nothing else
but the hopes of going a roguing
brought him to do it: however, the
service they did us was not the less:
and, therefore, as I had promised to be
grateful to them, I first ordered the
money to be paid them which they said
was cine to them on board their res-
pective ships; over and above thai, I
gave each of thera. a small sum of
.money in gold, which contented them
very well;'then 1 made the English-
man gunner in the ship, the gunner
.being now made second mute and pur-
ser; "the Dutchman ! made boatswain;
so they were both very well pleased,
and proved very serviceable, being bot.li
able seamen, and very stout fellows.'
' We were now on shore in China: if
1 thought myself banished and remote
.frotn my own country at Bengal, where
Jbhad many wajs,t© get home for, my
money, what could 1 think of myself
now, when 1 was got about a thousand
leagues farther otf from home, ami
perfectly definite of all manner of
prospect of return. All we had lor
it was, that in about four months'
time there was to be another fair
at thy place whei'c we were, uud
then we ought he able to purcba.-.e
ad sorts of the manufactures ofihe
country, aud withal might possibly
find some Chinese junks or vessels
from ToiMjiiiu, that would be to be
sold, and would carry us and out
goods whither we pleased. This 1
liked very well, and resolved to wait;
besides as our particular persons were
not obnoxious, so if any English or
Dutch ships came thither, perhaps
we might have an opportunity to
load our goods, and get passage to
some other place in India, nearer
home. Upon these hopes we resol-
ved to continue here; but, to divert
ourselves, we took two or three jour-
nies into the country* First, we
went ten (lays journey, to the city of
Nanquin, a city well worth seeing,
indeed; they say it has a million of
people in it: it is regularly built,
the streets all exactly straight, and
cross one another in direct lines,
which gives the figure of it great ad-
vantage. But when 1 come to com-
pare the miserable people of these
countries with ours, their fabrics,
their manner of living, their govern-
ment, their religion, their wealth, and
their glory, as some call it, 1 must con-
fess that I scarcely think it worth my
while to mention them here. It is very
observable, that we wonder at the
grandeur, the riches, the pomp, the
ceremonies, the government, the
manufactures, the commerce, the
conduct of these people; not' that it
is to be wondered at, or indeed in the
least to be regarded, but because
having a true notion of the barbarity
of those countries the rudeness and the
ignorance thai prevails there, we do
not expect to find any such thing so
far off. Otherwise, what are their
buildings to the palaces and royal
buildings of „ Europe? What their

with which ail their greatness and

wise it is in itself nothing at all;
for what 1 have *uid of their ships
may be said of their armies and
troops all the forces of their empire,
though they were to bring two mil-
lions of men into the field together,
would he able to do nothing but ruin
the country, and starve themselves, if
they were to besiege a strong town
in Flanders, or to light a disciplined
army; one good line of German
cuirassiers or of French cavalry,
might withstand all the horse • of
China; a million of their foot could
not stand before one embattled body
of our infantry, posted so as not
be surrounded, though they were to
be not one to twefity in number; nay,
1 do not boast if 1 say that thirty thou-
sand German or English foot, t and
ten thousand horse, well maiffiged,
could defeat all the forces of China;
and so of our fortified towns, and of
the art of our engineers in assaulting
.and defending towns; there is not a
fortified town in China, could hold
out one month against the batteries
and attacks of an European army;
and^at the same time,'all' the armies
of China could never take such a
town as Dunkirk, provided it was not
starved;, tip,, not in a tea years' siege.

As their strength and. their grandeur,
so their navigation, commerce and
husbandry is very imperfect, compared
to the same things in Europe: also in
their knowledge* their learning unci
"m their skill in the sciences, they are
either very awkward or defective,
though they have globes and spheres,
and a f-tiiatterlfig of the mathematics,
and think they know more than ail
the ivorid besides; but they 'know
little of the motions of the heavenly
bodies: and so grossly and absurdly
ignorant are their common people,
that when the sun is eclipsed, they
think a great dragon lias assaulted

it; and they fall a clattering with
all the drams and kettles in the coun-

'. I 'wis now, as near as 1 can com-
pute, in the heart of China, about
thirty degrees north of the line, for
we were 'returned from Nanquin:
I had,, indeed, a mind to see the city
of' Peking, which I had heard so
much of, and Father Simon impor-
tuned tiie daily to do it. At length
his time of, going away being set,
and the other' missionary who was to
§© with Mm being arrived from
faeao, it was necessary that we
-should resolve either to go or not;
so I  referred it wholly to my partner,
aid left, it wholly to Ms choice, who
at length resolved''it in the affirma-
tive, and we prepared for our journey.
We set. out with very good  advantage,
as' to finding the way, for we got
leave to travel in the retinue of one
of their Mandarins, a kind of viceroy
or principal magistrate in the pro-
vince1 'Where they reside, and who
take great' state upon them, travelling
with great attendance' and with great
homage from the people, who are
sometimes greatly impoverished by
them, being obliged to furnish pro-
visions for them and all their atten-
dants In their journeys. That which
1 • particularly observed, as to our
travelling with his baggage, was this,
that though we received sufficient pro-
vision's, both for ourselves and our
horses from the country, as belonging
tQ'thi' Mandarin, yet we were obliged ,
to: pay-for every thing we had, after
tie'"market, price of the country, and
•the' Mandarin's "steward-collected'it
durrfrotii lis'; *o-tuat our traveling
la toe retinue'of the Mandarin; thoigl
it was a very great kindness to us,
was not such a m%My 'favour fn him
but was a" great' advantage "to Mm
considering there were above thirty
other people travelling in the same
manner besides us, under the protec-
tion of his retinue; for the country
furnished all the provisions for nothing
to him, and yet lie took our money for
them,
We were twenty-five clays travelling
to Peking, through a country infinite*
ly populous, but I Jhiek badly culti-
vated; the husbandry, the economy,
and the way of' living miserable,
though they boast so much of the
industry of the people ; 1 say miser-
able if compared'with our own, but
not so to these poor wretches,' who
know no other. The pride "of the
people is infinitely great, and exceeded
by nothing but their poverty, in some
parts, which adds to that which I
call their misery; and 1 must needs
think the naked savages of America
live much more happy than the
poorer sort of these, because as they
have nothing, so they desire nothing;
whereas these are proud and insolent^
and in the main are in many parts _
mere beggars and drudges; their os-
tentation is inexpressible j and, _ if
they can, they love to keep multitudes'
of servants or slaves, which, is to the
last degree ridiculous, as well as the
contempt of all the world but i them*
selves,
I must confess, I travelled more
pleasantly afterwards in the' deserts
and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary
than here 5 and yet the roads here are
well paved and well kept, and" very con-
venient for travellers: but nothing was
more awkward to me than to see such a
Jta«j^ty, imperious, insolent people,
in the midst of the grossest simplicity
and ignorance; and my friend Father
Simon and 1 used to 'be very, "merry-
upon these occasions, to see 'the beg^
garfy pride of these people:"for ex-'
ample, coming by the house of a eoun-
try gentleman, as Father 'Simon "called"
him, about' ten' leagues off' the "city
of :Nanqujn, we had. fwt df/'ill .the.
honour to ride with the faster "of the;
house about two'mites;:'the state €eV;
rode in was. a perfect Bon 'Quiiitiim,""
being a mixture of pomp and poverty.
m
 
His habit was  very proper for a sea-,
ratntuch, or 'merry-andrew, being a
dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tas-
sels, and cuts and slashes almost on
every side 5 it covered a taffaty vest,
as greasy as a bucber's, and which tes-
tified that his honour must he a most
exquisite sloven. His horse was but a
poor, starved, hobbling creature, and
lie had two slaves followed him on foot
to drive the poor creature along; he
had a whip in his hand, and he belabour*
ed the beast as fast about the head as
his slaves did about the tail 5 and thus
he rode by us, with about ten or twelve
servants, going from the city to his
country seat, about half a league before
us., We travelled on gently, but this
figure of a gentleman rode away before
ms, and as we stopped at a village about
an hour to refresh us^ when we came
by the country seat of this great man,
we saw him in a little place before his
door, eating his repast. It was a kind
of a garden,, but he was easy to be
seen; and we were given to understand
that the more we looked at him the
better he would be pleased. He sat
under a tree, something like the palmet-
to, which effectually shaded hi in over
the head, and on the south side; but
under the tree was alsa placed a large
umbrella, which made that^part look
well enough; he gat lolling back in a
great elbow-chair, being a heavy cor-
pulent man, and had his meat brought
Min by two women slaves j he had two
niw, one of which fed the squire with
a spoon, and the other .held the dish
with one hand and scraped off what
lie let fall upon his worship's beard and
taffety vest.
Thus .leaving the poor wretch to
please himself with our looking at him,
as if we admired his pomp, though we
really.pitied and contemned him, we
pursued our journey $ only Father Si-
mon had the curiosity to stay to inform
himself what datntieg the country jus-
tice had to feed on in all his state, which
lie #had, the honour < to taste of, and,
which wa§, I think, a mess of boiled
ricf, with a great piece of garlic ia it,
and,a little, hag .filled with green pep-
per, and another plant .which they have
there,, toqietbiijy like oar ginger, bvjt
smelling like miisk*. and tasting  like
mustard 1 all this was put together*
and a small piece of lean mutton boiled
in it, and this was his worships re-
past; four or five servants more atten-
ded at a distance, who, we. supposed*
were to eat of the same after their
master. . \>-\,
As for our mandarin with whom-we
travelled, he was respected as a king,
surrounded always with his gentlemen;'
and attended in all his appearances with
such pomp, that I saw little of him' but
at a distance j but this 1 observed, that
there was not a horse in his retinu«
but that our carriers' pack-horses in
England seemed to me to look much
better; though it was hard to judge
rightly, for they were so covered
with equipage, mantles, trappings,
&c. that we could scarce see any thing
but their feet and their heads as they
went along,
1 was now light-hearted, and all ray
trouble and perplexity that 1 have, given
an account of being over, 1 had no
anxious thought about me, which
made this journey the pleasanter to
me 5 nor had 1 any ill accident attended
me, only in passing or fording a small
river, my horse fell, and'made mt
free of the country,, as they call it,
that is to say, threw me in; the' place
was not deep, but it wetted me all
over, I mention it, because ii spoiled
my • pocket-book, wherein 1 had set
down the names of several -people
and places which 1 had occasion -to;
remember, and.which, not taking due;
care of, the leaves rotted, aid tie-
words were never after to be read^ to
my great loss as to the names of some
places I touched at in this journey. • .
At length we arrived at Peking; i -
had nobody with me but the youth
whom my nephew the - captain . had .
given me to attend me as a servant*,.
and who proved very trusty and ;diliv
gent; and my partner had nobody with 
him but one servant,' who was-* kins* -

ADVENIOflilS Of
 
English;  and, indeed* this old man
wm§ - & most useful implement to us
every where; fur we had nor been
above a week at Peking; when lie came
laughing, Ah, seignior lnglese, says
he,,.!'have something to tell you will
make yotir heart glad*—* My heart glad I
says 1; what can that be? 1 clout know
mj tiling in this country can either
give me joy or grief, to any great cle-
free.—Yes, yes, said the old man, in
roken English, make you glad, me
sorry.—Why, said I, will it make you
sorry?—Because, said lie, you have
brought me. here twenty-five days'
journey, and will leave me to go hack
alone, and which way shall 1 get to
ray port afterwards without a ship,
without a horse, without pecune .* so he
called.money, being* his broken Latin,
of which he had abundance 'to make
us. merry with. In short, he told us
there wm a great caravan of Musco-
vite and Polish merchants in the city,
preparing to set out on their journey
by laud to Muscovy, within four or five
weeks, and he wits sure we would take
the -opportunity to go with them, and
leave him behind, to go hack alone,
I confess I was greatly surprised
with this good news, and had scarce
power to speak to him for some time:
but at" last I turned to him, How do
you know this? said I, Are you sure
it is true?-—Yes, says he; I met this
morning in the street an old acquain-
tance of mine, an Armenian, who is
among them; he came last from As-
tfticari, and was designing to go toTon-
fttln, where I formerly knew him, but
mm altered his mind, and is now re-
itived to go with the caravan to' Mos-
cpwv and so down the river Wolga to
Astracan.—Well, seignior, says I, do
i»t, be uneasy about being left to go
back '.alone; if this be a method for
aiy>return to England, it shall be your
fault if you go back to Macao at all.
We tiien went to consult together
what was to he done; and I asked my
partner what tie thought of the pilot's
iiews, ^and whether it would' suit with
Ms^ffairs? He told me he would do
just «s I would, 'for, he had settled all
hi§» affairs so well at Bengal, and' -left
Ms effects in such good kauris, that m
we; had made a good voyage here, if he
could vest it in China silks, wrought
and raw, such as might be worth the
carriage, lie would be content to go to
England, and then make his voyage
back to Bengal by the Company*?*
ships.
Having resolved upon this, we agreed
that if our Portuguese pilot would go
with us, we would bear his charges to
Moscow, or to England, if he pleased;
nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed
over generous in that neither, if we
had not rewarded him farther, the
service he had •clone us being really
worth more than that: for he had not
only been a pilot to us at sea, but he
had* been like a broker for us on shore;
and his procuring for us the Japan
mercliant was* -some hundreds of pounds
in our pockets. So we consulted to-
gether about it, and being willing to
gratify him, which was but doing him
justice, and very willing also to have
him with us besides, for he was a most
necessary man on all occasions, we
agreed to give him a quantity of coin-
ed gold, which, a« 1 compute it, came
to about one hundred and seventy-five
pounds sterling, between Us, and to hear
all his charges, both for himself and
horse, except only a horse to carry
his goods. Having settled this between
ourselves, we called him to let him
know what we had resolved. I told
him he had complained of our being
to let him go back alone, and I was
now to tell him we were resolved he
should not go back at all; that as we
had resolved to go to Europe with the
caravan, we resolved also he should go
with us; and that we called him to know
his mind. He shook his head, and said,
it'was a long journey, and he had no
pecune to carry him thither, or to sub-
sist himself when lie came there.  We
told him we believed it was so, and
therefore we had resolved to do some-
thing for hi in that should let him see
how sensible we were of the service he
had done us, and also how agreeable he
was to us; and then I told him whit
we had resolved to give him here,
which he- might lay out as we would
do our own * and that as for his charges,
if lie'would go with us 'we. would set
him safe: ©ir shore,; (life antfcastiilttes
excepted,) either in Muscovy- or lag-
 
hoIUNSon rursoK.
m
 
lliiiil, which he would, at our own
charge, except ouly the carriage of
his good*, lie received the proposal
like 11 ujitu transported, and tuhl us he
would go with u* over the whole world;
and so wc ail prepared for our journey.
However, as ii was with u*s so it wa«
with the other merchants; they had
many things to doj find instead of
being ready In five weeks, il was four
mouths and sonic days before ail things
were got together.
Jt was the beginning of February,
our style, when we set out from Peking.
My partner and the old pilot had gone
express buck to the port where we hud
first put iii» to dispose of some goods
which we hud left there; and I, with a
Chinese merchant whom I had some
knowledge of at Nauquin, and who
came 'to Peking on bis own affairs,
went to Nanquin, where 1 bought
ninety pieces of fine damasks, with
about two-hundred pieces of other
very tine silks of several sorts, Home
mixed with gold, and had nil, these
brought to Peking agaiusf my partner's
return; besides this we bought a very
large quantity of raw silk, and some
other goods, our cargo amounting1, in
these goods only, to about three thou-
sand five hundred pounds sterling;
which, together with tea, and some fine
calicoes, and three camels' loads of
nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all
eighteen camels for our share, besides
those we rode upon j which, with two
fir three spare horses, and two horses
loaded with provisions, made us, in
short, twenty-six camels and horses iu
our retinue.
The company was very great, and,
'88 near as f can remember, made be-
tween three and four hundred horse,
and upwards of one hundred and twenty
'inert; very well armed, and provided for
all events: for as the eastern caravans
•are subject to'be attacked by the Arabs,
so "are these by the Tartars ; but they
are not altogether so dangerous as the
Arabs, nor 'so barbarous", when they
prevail
, The company consisted of people of
.several nations;'.hut there were above
sixty -of them 'merchant's or inhabit-
ants of Moscow; though of them som'e
%wfe Livoniand; ajnd/to our particular
satisfaction, five of them were Scots,
who appeared also to be men of'great
experience in buMtu'ss, and'of'Very
good substance. ' 
When lie had travelled one day's
journey, the guides who were live in
number, called all the gen tie in en and
merchants, that is to say, all the pas-
sengers except the servants, to a great
council, us tltpy called it. At" this
council every orie deposited ti certain
tjuaurity of money to u, common stock,
for the necessary expense of buying
forage on the way, where it was* not
otherwise to be bad, and for satisfying'
the guides, getting horses, and'the
like: and here ttiey constituted the
journey, us they call it, viz, they named
captains and officers 4o draw us all Up,
and give the word of command, in
case of an attack, and give every one
their turn of command; nor was this
forming m into order, any more that
what we found needful upon the way,
as shall be observed.
The road ail on this side of "the
country is very populous and is full
of potters, mid earth makers, that is
to say, people! that temper the ettrth
for the China-ware: and as I was
coining along, our Portugal pilot, who
kid always something or other to say
to make its merry, came sneering to
me, anil told nie he would shew me
the greatest rarity in all the country,
and that I should have this to say of
China, after all the ill-humoured things
1 had said of it, that ! had seen one
thing which was not to he seen in all
the world beside. I was very impor-
tunate to know what it was; at last
he told me it was a gentleman's house
built with China-ware. Well, says I,
are not the materials of their buiiuings
the product of their own country,
and so it is all China-ware, is it not?—
No, no, says lie, I mean it is a house
all made of Chiiia-ware, such m you
call it in England, or as it is called ih
our country, porcelain,—-Well, says" I,
such a thing may be; how big is-it?
Can we carry it in a box upon a camel?
If wc can we will buy it.-~Upon' it
camel! says the old pilot, holding tip
both his hands; why there Is & fcmtly
of thirty people lives in it.

had 1 not been'upon the journey. I
could have, staid >nine day to sec and

fo'd me there were fountains ami umi-
ponds in the warden, all paved on the
bottom and sides with the same; and
fuse statues set up in rows on the
walks, entirely formed of the porce-
lain earth and burned whole.
As this is one of the singularities of
'China, so they may be allowed to
excel in it; but I am very .sure they
excel iu their accounts of it; for they
told mo Mie.h incredible things of their
performance in crockery-ware, for such
it is. thai i ease not to relate, as know-
ing it could not. be true. They told
me, in particular, of one workman

ADVENTURES OF
 
occasion, and yet with melt cool
courage too, that 1/ never'saw any
ifiatt ;iu action fitter1 for command.
As soon as wo carnc up to them, we
frreel our pistols in their faces, and
then drew; but they fled in the great-
est 'confusion imaginable. The only
stand any of them made was on our
right, wncrc three of them stood, and,
by signs called the rest to come back
to them, having a kind of scimitar iii
their hands, and their bows hanging
to their hacks. Our 'brave comman-
der, without asking any body to fol-
io*? him, gallops up close to them,^
and with his fusee knocks one of
them off his horse, killed the second
with his pistol, and the third ran
away; and thus ended our fight: hut
we had this misfortune attending it,
that all our mutton we had in chase
got away. We had not a man killed
or hurt; but as for the Tartars, there
were about live of them killed; how
many were wounded we knew not;
but this wc knew, that the other
party were so frightened with the
noise of our guns," that they made
off, and * never made any attempt
upon us.
We were all this while in the
Chinese dominions, and therefore the
Tartars were not so bold as after-
wards; hut in about five days we
entered a vast, great; wild desert,
which held us three clays and nights'
march; and we were obliged to carry
our water : with us in great leathern
bottles, and to encamp all night, just
as !'have heard they do in the desert
of Arabia.
'1 asked our guides whose dominion
tills was in; and they told -me this
was a kind of border, that might be
called no man's land, being a part
of   ftreafc 'Karakathay, or Grand
Tartafy; but, however, it was all
reckoned as belonging to China, but
that there was nV care taken here
to" preserve' it from the inroads of
thieves, and therefore it' was reckoned
the worst desert in the whole march,
fhottgh we were to go over some
Afticii larger.
In passing this' wilderness, which
Was'f at tot very" frightful -to' me,
Hire saw, two or three' tithes, little
paities of the Tartars, but they seemed
in be upon their own affairs, and to
have no design upon us: and no,
like the man who met the devil, if
they had nothing to say to us, we
had" nothing to say to them; we let
them go. *" Once, however, a party
of them came so near as to stand
and gaze at us; whether it was to
eonsiuer if they should attack us or
not, we knew not; but when we
were passed at some distance by
them, we made a rear guard of forty
men, and stood ready for them, hit-
ting the caravan pass half a mile or
thereabouts before us: hut after a
while they marched off; only we
found they saluted us with live ar-
rows at their parting, one of which
wounded a horse, so that it disabled
him, and we left him the next clay,
poor creature, in great need of a good
farrier: they might shoot more ar-
rows, which might fall short of us,
but we saw no more arrows or Tartars
that time.
We travelled near a month after
this, the ways not being so good
as at fin4, though still in the domi-
nions of the emperor of China, but
lay for the most part in villages, s»ome
of which were fortified, because of
the incursions of the Tartars. When
we were come to one of these towns
(it was about two flays .and a half
journey before we were come to the
city or* Naum), 1 wanted to buy a
earn el, of which there are plenty to
be sold all the way upon that road,
and horses also, such as they are,
because so many caravans coming
that way the? are often wanted. The
person that t spoke to, to get me a
camel, would have gone and fetched
'One for me; but I, like a fool, must
be officious, and go myself along
with him: the place was "about two
miles out of the village, where - it
seems they kepi the camels and horses
feeding under a guard.
I walked it on foot, with my old
pilot and a Chinese, being very de-
sirous of a little variety., "When we
Came to the place, it* was a low
ma'rshy ground, walled.round with,a
stone wall, piled up dry, without
mortar or earth among it, Eke a pari,
uohinson cmusoiL
w
 
with a little guard of Chinese soldiers
at the door. Having bought a camel,
and agreed Cor the price, 1 came
away, and tlie Cliiite.-euutJi that went
with itie led tin* camel, when on a
.sudden came up five Tartars on horse-
hack; two of rliciii seized the fellow
md took the camel from him, while
the other three stepped up to me
and my old pilot, string" us, m it
were, unarmed, for I had no weapon
about me hut my sword, which could
but ill defend me. against three horse*
men. The first that came up stopped
short upon my drawing- my sword,
for they are arrant cowards; hut a
second coming" upon my left, gave-
roe a blow on the head, which 1 never
felt titi afterwards, and wondered,
when 1 came to myself, what was
the matter, and where 1 was, for lie
laid me flat on the ground; but my
never-failing old pilot, the Portu-
guese (so Providence, unlooked for,
directs deliverances .from dangers
which to us are unibrseen), had a

nothing of, nor the Tartars neither;
if they had, I suppose they would
not have attacked us; but cowards
are always boldest when there is no
danger. The old man seeing me
down, with a bold heart stepped up
to the fellow that had struck me, and
laying" hold of his arm with one hand,
and pulling him down by main force
a little towards him with the other,
shot h'ftn in the head, and laid him
dead upon the spot He then imme-
diately stepped up to him who had
stopped us, as 1 said, and before he
could come forward again, made a
blow at him with a scimitar which lie
always wore, but missing the mail
cut his horse in the side of his head,
cut one of the ears off by the root,
and a great slice down by the side of
his face. The poor beast, enraged
with the wound, was no more to be
governed bv his rider, though the fel-
low sat well enough too, but away he

like a pole-axe, but not a pole-axe

Ktill too, and fell to work with his
tackle to charge his pistol again;
but as soon as the Tartar saw the pis-
tol, away he scoured, and left my
pilot, my champion i called him after*
wards, a complete victory.
By this time f was a little reco-
vered; for I thought wheu I first
began to wake, that i had been in
a sweet sleep; but, as J said above*
1 wondered where I was, how 1 came
upon the ground, anil what was the
matter; but a few moments after,
as sense returned, 1 felt pain, though
I did not know where; so 1 clapped
in? hand to my head, and took it
away bloody; then I felt my head
ache; and then, in a moment/memo*
ry returned, and every thing wag
present to me again* I jumped upon
my feet instantly, and got hold of
my sword, but no enemies in view;
1 found a Tartar lie dead, mi
his horse standing very quietly by
him; and, looking farther* 1 saw
my champion and deliverer, who
had been to see what the Chinese
had done, coming back with his
hanger In his hand: the old mmp
seeing me on my feet, came running
to me, and embraced me with a great
deal of joy, being afraid before that 1
had been killed; and seeing me
bloody, would stilt see how 1 was hurt;
but it was not much* only whit we
call a broken head; neither did t
afterwards find any great inconveni-
ence from the blow, for it was well
again in two or three days.

be f aid for the camely 1 disputed it,
and It was brought to .a hearing before
the Chinese judge of the place. To
give him his due, .he acted, with a
great- deal of prudence and impar-
tiality; -and, having heard both sidesf
he - gravely asked. the Chinese man
that went with me,to buy the camel,
whose servant he was? I am no ser-
vant, says he, but went with the
stranger.—At whose request? says the
justice. At the stranger's request,
says he. Why then, says the justice,
you were the stranger's servant for
the time j and the camel being de-
livered to his servant, it was deli-
vered to him, and he must pay
for it.
1 confess the thing was so clear*
that 1 had not a word to say: but,
admiring to eee such just reasoning
upon the 'Consequence, and an accu-
rate stating of the ease,' 1 paid wil-
lingly for the camel, and seat for
another; but* you may observe, 1
did not go to fetch it myself any
more, for I had had enough of that.
The city of Naum is a frontier of
the Chinese empire; they call it
fortified, and so it is, as fortifications
go there; for this I will venture to
affirm, that all the Tartars in Kara-
katltay, which, 1 believe, are some
millions, could not batter down the
walls, with their bows and arrows;
but to call it strong, if it were attack-
ed with cannon, would lie to make
those who understand it laugh at
you.'
We wanted, as I have said, above
two days' journey of this city, when
messengers were sent express to
•every part of the road, to tell all
travellers and caravans to halt till
they had a guard sent for- them j for
that an unusual body of Tartars,
making ten thousand in all, had ap-
peared*" in the way, about thirty miles
beyond' the. city.
. . This wa&;very bad news to travel-
ler*;-however it was, carefully done
of the governor! and we were,,very
glad  to :?be,ftr we; should, have a guard.
Accordingly, two days after, we had
two hundred soldien  sent us from
a garrison ©f the Chinese, on  ettr
left, and three hundred more from the
city of Naum, and with these we ad-
vanced boldly; the three hundred
soldiers from Naum marched in our
front, the two hundred in our rear,
and,our men on each side of our ca-
mels, with our baggage, and the whole
caravan in the centre; in this order
and well prepared for battle, we
thought ourselves- a match for the
whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, -
if they had appeared; but the next
day, when they did appear, it was
quite another thing.
It was early in the morning, when,
marching from a well situated little
town, called Changu, we had a river
to pass, which we were obliged to
ferry; and had the Tartars had any
intelligence, then had been the time
to have attacked us, when the cara-
van being over, the rear guard was
behind; but they did not appear
there. About three hours after, when
we were entered upon a desert of
about fifteen or sixteen miles over,
behold, by a cloud of dust they
raised, we saw an enemy was at
hand; and they were at hand, in-
deed, for they 'came on upon the
spur.
The Chinese, our guard on the
front, who had talked so big the clay
before, began to stagger; and the
soldiers frequently looked behind
them, which is a certain sign in a
soldier that he is just ready to run
away. My old pilot was of my mind;
and being near me, called out, Seig-
nior Inglese, says he, those fellows
must be encouraged, or ' they will
ruin us all; for if the Tartars* come
on, they will never stand it.—I am
of your mind,, said I; but what must
be "done ?—Done 1 says he, let fifty
©f our men advance, and iank them
on each wing, and encourage them:
and they will fight like brave fellows,
in brave company; but, without this,
kthey will every man turn his back.
* Immediately I rode up to our leader,
and, told aim, who was exactly of
our mind 5 „ and accordingly fifty of
us marched, to the right wing, and
fifty to the left, and the rest mfcde-k
line "of rescue,; and so we .marched,
 
 
m
 
leaving -the last two hundred men to
make a body by themselves, and to
guard the camels; only that, if need
were, they should send  a hundred men
to assist the last fifty.
In a word, the Tartars came on, and
an innumerable company, they were;
how many we could not tell, but ten
thousand, we thought, was the least;
a party of them came on first and
viewed our posture, traversing the
ground in the front of our line; and,
as we found them within gun-shot,
our leader ordered the two wings to
advance swiftly, and give them a salvo
on each wing with their shot,*which
was clone; hut they went off, and I
suppose back, to give an account of
the reception they were like to meet
with; and, indeed, that salute cloyed
their stomach*, for they immediately
halted, stood awhile to consider of it,
and wheeling off to the left, they gave
over their design, and said no more to
lis4? for that time j which was very agree-
able to our circumstances, which were
but very indifferent for a battle with
smell a number.
Two days after we came to the city
of Maun* or Naum j we thanked the
governor for his care of us, and col-
lected to the value of a hundred
crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave
to the soldiers sent to guard us; and
here we rested one dav. This is a
garrison, indeed, and there were nine
hundred soldiers kept here; but the
reason of. it was, that formerly the
Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them
than they now do, the Muscovites
having abandonee! that part of the
country, which lies from this city west
for about two hundred miles, as deso-
late and unfit for use; and more espe-
cially being so very remote, and so
difficult to send troops thither for its
defence: for we had yet above two
thousand miles to Muscovy, properly
so called,
a After this we passed several great
rivers^ and two dreadful deserts; one
of which we were sixteen days pas-
sing over; and which, as 1 said, was
to be called no man's land; and, on
the 13th of April, we came to the
frontiers., of the Muscovite dominions^

in, as I called it, a Christian country*
or, at least, in a country governed by

not where the people, given up by

stocks and stones; worship monsters,
elements, horrid-shaped animals, and
statues or images or monsters. Not
a town or city we passed through but
had their pagods, their idols, and their,
temples, and ignorant people worship-
ping even the works of their own
hands. Now we came where, at last,

ney. Well, says I, but still it is better
than paganism and worshipping of
devils.-—Why, I will tell yon, says he,

•and miles farther, Is' inhabited by the
w^rst and most Ignorant of pagans;
and so, indeed, we found it.
'We were now launched into the
greatest piece of solid earth, if I 'un-
derstand any thing of the surface of
ihe globe, that is to be found in any
part of the' world'; we had, at least,
twelve thousand miles to the sea cast-
ward; two thousand to the bottom of
Ihe Baltic sea, westward; and above
three thousand, if we left that sea and
went on west to the British "and French
Channels: we had full five thousand
miles tO' the Indian or Persian sea,
south; and about eight hundred to the
frozen sea north, Kay, if some peo-
ple may be believed, there might be
no sea, north-east tilt we came round
the pole, and consequently into the
north-west, and so had a continent of
land into America, the Lord knows
where; though 1 could give some
reasons why 1 believe that to be a
mistake.
As we entered into the Muscovite
dominions a good while before we
came to any considerable towns, we
had nothing "to observe there but this;
first, that all the rivers run to the east;
as 1 understood by the charts, which
some In our caravan had with them,
it was plain all these rivers ran into the
great river Yamour, or Gamour j which
fiver, by the natural course of it, must
fun into the East sea, or Chinese ocean.
The story'they tell us, that the month
M this' river is choked up with bul-
rushes of a monstrous growth, viz.
ihree feet about, and twenty or thirty
feet high,' 1 must be allowed to say,
1' believe nothing of it; but, as its
navigation is of no use, because there
is no trade that way, the Tartar*, to
whom it alone belongs, dealing in no-
thing but cattle, so nobody, that ever
1 heard of, has been curious enough
either to' go down to the' mouth of
It in boats, or come up from the
mouth of it in ships, as far as I can
find': but this is certain, that this river
running east in the latitude of about
ifty degrees, carries a vast concourse
of rivers along with it, and finds an
ocean to empty Itself in that latitude $
so we are sure* of sea there.
Some, leagues to the north of this
river there are teveral considerable
rivers, whose streams run as due north
as the Yamour runs east, and these
are all found to join their waters with
the great river Tartarus, named so from
the northermost nations of the Mogul
Tartars; who, as the Chinese say, were
the first Tartars in the world; and who,
as our geographers allege, are the Gog
and Magog mentioned in sacred story,
These rivers running all northward, as
well as all the other rivers I am yet to
speak of, make it evident that the
northern ocean bounds the land also
on that side; so that it does not seem
rational In the least to think that the
land can extend itself to join with
America on that side, or that there is
not a communication between the
northern' and eastern ocean; but of
this 1 shall say no more; it was my
observation at that time, and therefore
1 take notice of it in this place.
We now advanced from the river
Arguua by easy and moderate jour-
neys, and were very visibly obliged to
the care the Czar of Muscovy^ has
taken to have cities and towns built in
as mail? places as it is possible to place
them, where his soldiers keep garrison,
something like the stationary soldiers
placed by the Romans in the remotest
countries of their empire; some of
which that 1 had read of were placed
in Britain, for the security of com-
merce, and for the lodging travellers;
and thus it was here; for wbere«ever
we came, though at these towns and
stations the garrisons' and governors
were Russians and professed Christians,
yet the inhabitants were mere pagans;
sacrificing to idols, and worshipping
the sun, "moon, and stars, or all the
host of heaven; and not only so, but
were, of all the heathens and pagans
that ever 1 met with, the most barba-
rous, except only that they did not eat
men's flesh, aa our savages of Aine^
rica did.
'' Some instances of this we met with
in the country between Arguna, where
we enter the Muscovite dominions, and
a city of Tartars and Russians toge-
ther, called Nortziousky, in which is a
continued desert or forest, which cost
us twenty days to travel over. In a
village, near the last of these places, I

way of living, wliieli Is most brutbh
ami iios,ii(i*erablc: they had, 1 suppose,
a great sacrifice that day; for there
btootl out, upon an old stump of a
tree, an idol made of wood, frightful
a$'the devil; at least, as any tiling we
can think of to represent the devil can
he made: it had a head not so much as
resembling any creature that the world
ever saw;'ears as big us gouts' horns,
and as high j eyes as big as a crown-
piece; a nose like a crooked ram's
horn, and a mouth extended four-cor-
nered, like that of a Hon, with horrible
teeth, hooked like a parrot's under-
bill: it was dressed up in the filthiest
maimer that you could suppose; its
upper garment was of sheep-skins,
with the wool outward; a great
Tartar bonnet on the head, with two
horns growing through it; it was
about eight feet high, yet had no feet
or legs,"'or any other proportion of
parts.
This scarecrow was set up at the
outside of the village; and when I
came near to it, there were sixteen or
seventeen creatures, whether men or
women 1 could not tell, for they
made no distinction by their habits,
either of body or head, all laying
flat upon the giound round this
formidable block of .shapeless wood:
i saw no motion among them any
more .than if they had been logs of
wood, like the idol* and at firnt 1 really
thought they had been so; but, when I
came a little nearer, they started up
upon their feet, and raised a howling cry
as if it had been so many deep-moutheu
hounds, and walked away, as if I hey
we»*e displeased at our disturbing them.
A little way off from the idol, and at
the door of a tent or hut made all of
sheep-skins and cow-skins dried, Ftood
three butchers,—I thought they were
such; for when 1 came nearer to them,
1 found they had long knive* in their
hands; and in the middle of the tent
appeared three sheep killed, and one
young bullock or steer. These, it
seems, were sacrifices to that senseless
log of an idol; the three men were
priests belonging to it, and the seven-
teen prostrated wretches were the
people who brought the offering/-and
were making their prayer* to that
stork.
I confess,, I. .was more moved at their
stupidity and brutish worship, -of ;a

glorious and. best creature, to whom
lie had granted so, many advantage*,

with faculties and capacities adapted
both to honour his Maker and, be ho-

it was, and I saw it before my eyes,

let' litem see that it had no .power
to help itself; and consequently could
not lie an object of worship* or to be
prayed to, much less help them that
olerecl sacrifices to it.
He laughed at me: says lie, Your
zeal may be good, but what do you
propose to yourself by it?—-Propose!
said I, to vindicate the honour of God,
which is insulted by this devil-worship.
•—But how will it vindicate the honour
of God, said he, while the people will
not be able to know what you mean
by it, unless you could 'speak to them,
and tell them so? and then they will
fight you, and beat you too, I'll assure
you; for they are'desperate fellows,
and that especially in defence of their
idolatry .—Can we not, said 1, do it in
the night, and then leave them the rea-
•sons and the causes in writing in their
own language ?—Writing! said he;
.why there is not a man in five nations
of them that knows any thing of a let-
ter, or how to read a word any way.—
Wretched ignorance! said I to him;
.however, I have a great mind to do it;
•perhaps nature may draw inferences
from it to them, to let them see how
brutish they are to worship such horrid
.things.—Look you, sir, said he, if
;your zeal prompts you to it so warmly,
•you must do it; but, in the next place,

into my .head for awhile, but 1 harped
upon the fame string still; and all that
dny I mm nmmj to put my,-project in
execution. Towards the evening the
Scots merchant met roe by accident In
our walk about the town, and. desired
to .speak with me; 1 believe, said he,
I have you put off your good design; 1
have been a little"concerned about it
since; for 1 abhor idolatry is much as>
yon can do.—Truly, said* 1, you have
put it off a little, as to the execution of
it, but you have not put. it out of my
thoughts; 'and! believe 1 shall do it'Still
before 1 quit this place, though 1 were
to be delivered up to the in for satisfac-
tion,—Ko, no, eaicl he, God forbid
they should deliver you up to such a
crew of monsters! the? shall .not do
that neither; that would be murdering-
you indeed.—-Why, said I, how would
they use me?*—Use you! said he, I'll
tell you how they served a poor Rus-
sian, who affronted them in their wor-
ship, just us you did, and whom they
took prisoner, after they had lamed
him with an arrow, that lie could nol
run away: they took him and stripped
him stark-naked, and set him upon the
top of the idol-monster, and stood all
roiiiM^ him and shot as many arrows
into him as would stick over his whole
body; and then they burnt him, and
all the arrows sticking in him, as a sa-
crifice to the idol.—'And was this the
same idol? said I. Yes, said he, the
very same.—-Well, said I, I will tell
you'a story. So I related the story of
our men at Madagascar, and how they
burnt and sacked 'the village there, and
killed man, woman, and child, for their
murdering one of our men just as it is
related before; and I added, that I
thought we ought to do so to this vil-
lage.
He .listened very attentively to the
story; but when ! talked of doing, so
to that village, said he, You mistake
very much; it -was not this village, it
was almost a hundred miles from this
place; but it was the same idol, for
they carry him about in procession all
over the country.-^Well, said I, then
that idol ought to be punished for it;
and it shall/'said I, if I live this night
out.
 ^ In a word, finding me resolute,'he
"liked the design, 'and told me I should
..not go alone, but; he would go with
me^ but he'Would go first and bring
a tftbiit fellow, one of his countrymen,

to go -also, with us; and ©tie, said he,
H5'fanioiiR:ior his-zeal- as you can de-
sire any one'to be against such devilish
tilings m these. In a word, lie brought
me his comrade* a Scotsman, whonihe
called .captain'Richardson; and I gave
him a full account of what 1 had seen,
and also what I intended: and lie told
me readily, he would go with me if il
co.3t liiiii 'his life. So we agreed to go,
only we three. I had, indeed, proposed
it to my partner, but lie declined it.
He said, lie was ready to assist me to
the utmost, and upon all occasions,
for my defence; but this was an ad-
venture quite out of his way; so, I
say, we resolved upon our work, only
we three and my man-servant, and to
put it in execution that night about
midnight, with ail the secrecy imagi-
nable.
However, upon second thoughts we
were willing* to delay it till the next
night, because, the caravan being to set
foward in the morning, we supposed
the governor could not pretend to give
them any satisfaction upon us when
we were out' of his power. The Scots
merchant, as steady Iti his resolution
for the enterprise, as bold in execut-
ing, brought me a Tartar's robe or
gown of sheep-skies, and a bonnet,
with a bow and arrows, and had pro-
vided the same for himself and his
country man, that the people, if they
saw us, should not be able to determine
who we were.
AM the first night we spent in mix-
ing up some combustible matter with
aqua vita, gunpowder, and such other
materials as we could get; and, having
a quantity of tar in a little pot, about
an hour after night we set out upon
our expedition.
We-came to the place about eleven
o'clock at night, and found that the
people had not the least jealousy of
.danger attending their idol. The night
was cloudy; yet the moon gave U3
light enough to see that the idol stood
.just in the same posture and place that
it did before. The people seemed to
be all at their rest; only, that in the
'great hut, or tent, as we called it,
. where we saw the,three- priests whom
'"W^ mistook for butcher?!, we saw a
light; arid-going up clotie'to the door,
we heard people talking*-ad If the:re
five or six of'them'?'we concluded,
therefore, that if we tet wildfire'to the
idol, these men would come out imme-
diately and run up to the place-to'res*
cue it from the destruction that we in*
tended for it; and what to''do -'Willi
them we knew not. Once we thought
of carrying it away and setting fire to
it at a distance, but when we came to
handle it, we found it too bulky for our
carriage; so we were at a Joss again.
The second Scotsman was for netting
fire to the tent or hut, and knocking
the creatures that were there on the
head, when they came out; but I
could not join with that; I was against
killing them, if it were possible to
avoid' it. Well, then, said the Scots
merchant, I will tell, yon what we will
do: we will try to make them pri-
soners, tie their hands, and make them
stand and see their idol destroyed.
As it happened, we had twine or
packthread enough about us, which we
used to tie our firelocks together with j
so we resolved to attack these people
first, and with as little noise as we
could. The first thing we did, we
knocked at the door, when, one of-the
priests coining' to it, we immediately
seized upon him, stopped his mouth
and tied his bands behind him, and led
him to the idol, where we gagged him
that he might not make a noise, tied Ms
feet also together, and left him on the
ground. '
Two of us then waited at the door,
expecting that another would come
out, to see what the matter was; but
we waited so long till the third  man
came back to us; and then >nobody
coming out, we knocked again gently,
and immediately out came two more,
and--we served them just in the same
manner, but were obliged to go mil
with them, and lay them down'by the
idol some distance from one another;
when, going back, we found' two' more
were come out to the door,'and a' third
stood behind them within the'"door.
We seized the two, and immediately
tied them, 'when the third "Stepping

'ADVENTURI& OF
 
out a composition we" had made, that
would only smoke and stink, lie set fire
to it and threw it in among tlicin: by
that time the other Scotsman and my
man, taking charge of the two men al-
ready bound, and tied together also by
the anii, led them away to the idol,
and left them there to see if their idol
would relieve them, making haste back
to us.
When the furze we had thrown in
had tilled the hut with so itiueh smoke
that they were almost suffocated, we
then threw in a small leather bag of
another kind, which flamed like a candle,
and following it in, we found there
were hut four people, and as we sup-
posed, had been about some of their
diabolic sacrifices. They appeared, in
short, frightened to death, so as to sit
trembling and stupid, and not able to
speak neither, for the smoke.
In a word, we took them, bound
them as we had done the other, and all
without any noise. 1 should have said
we brought them out of the house, or
hut, first •, for indeed we were not able
to bear the smoke any more than they
were. When we had done this, we car*
rietl them altogether to the idol: when
we eame there we fell to work with Mm;
.•nd first we daubed him all over, and
b-> robes also, with tar, and such other
i off as we had, which was tallow mixed
w«r,h brimstone; then we stopped his
.-.•\es and ears and mouth full of gun-
powder; then we wrapped up a great
i«i--ce of wild-fire in his bonnet; and
11»«!ii sticking all the combustibles'we
li.id brought with its upon him, w,e
(•>kcd about to see if we could find
:>:iy thing eke to help to burn himj
•.'en my Scotsman remembered that
by the tent or hut, where the men
"vre, there lay a heap of dry forage,
w hethcr straw or rushes I do not remem-
ber; away he and the other Scotsman
i an Mid fetched their arms full of that.
When we had clone this, we took
;:!! our prisoners, and brought them,
b;i\ing'untied their feet and imgagged
\vir months, and made them,stand up,
and set them just before their monstrous
hlol, and then set fire to the whole.
We staid by it ,'a quarter of an hour,
<•• thereabouts, till the powder in the
eyes and month and ears of the idol
blew up, and, as we could perceive,
bad split and deformed the shape of it;
and in a word, till we saw it burnt into
a mere block or a log of wood; and
setting the dry forage to it we found it
would be soon quite consumed; so we
began to think of going away; but the
Scotsman .said, no, we must not go, for
these poor clehided wretches will all
throw themselves into the fire, and burn
themselves with the idol. So we re-
solved to stay till the forage was burnt
clown too, and then we came away and
left them.
After the feat was performed, we
appeared in the morning among our
fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in
getting ready for our journey; nor could
any man suggest that we had been any
where hut in our beds, as travellers
might he supposed to be, to fit them-
selves for the fatigues of the day's
journey.
But the affair did not end so; the
next day came a great number of the
country people to the town gates, and
in a most outrageous manner demanded
satisfaction of the Russian governor
for the insulting their priests, and burn-
ing their great Cham Chi-Thaungu.
The people of Nertsinskay were at first
i n a great consternation, for they said
the Tartars were already no less than
thirty thousand strong. The Russian
governor sent out messengers to ap-
pease them, and gave the in all the good
words imaginable; assuring them that
he knew nothing of it, and that there
had not a soul in his garrison been
abroad, so that it could not be from
any body there; but if they could let
him know who did it, they should be
exemplarily punished. They returned
haughtily that all the country reve-
renced the great Cham Chi/f haungu,
who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal
would have dared to offer violence to
his image but some christian miscreant;
and they therefore resolved to denounce
war against him and ail the: Russians,
who, they said, were miscreants and
christians.,
The governor, still patient, and un-
willing to make a breach, or to have
any cause of war alleged to be given by
2B9
 
 
him, the czar having strictly charged
them to treat the conquered country
with gentleness and civility, gave them
still all the good words lie could. At
last he told "them there was a caravan
gone towards Russia that morning, and
perhaps it was some of them who had
done them this injury; and that if they
would he satisfied with that, lie would
send after them to inquire into it. This
seemed to appease them a little; and
accordingly the governor sent after us,
and gave us a particular account how
the thing was, intimating withal, that
if any in our caravan had done it, they
should make their escape; but that
whether we had done it or no, we should
make all the haste forward that was
possible; and that, in the nican time,
lie would keep them in play as long im
he could.
Tltw was very friendly in the gover-
nor; however, when it came to the ca-
ravan, there was nobody knew any
thing of the matter ; anil m for us that
were guilty, we were least of all sus-
pected. However, the captain of the
caravan for the time took the hint that
the governor gave us, and we travelled
two' days and two nights without any
considerable stop, and then we lay at a
village called PI othus; nor did we make
any long stop here, but hastened on to-
wards Jaraweim, another of the Czar
of Muscovy's colonies, and where we
expected we should be safe. But upon
the second day's march from Plothus,
by the clouds* of dint behind us at a
great 'distance, some of our people be-
gan to he sensible we were pursued.
We had entered a great desert, and had
passed by a great lake called Schakg
0«*er, when we perceived a very great
body of horse appear on the other side
of tne lake, to the north, we travelling
west. We observed they went away
west,-as we did, hut had supposed we
would have taken that side of the lake,
whereas we ?ery happily took the south
sidt; and in two days more they dis-
appeared again: for they believing' we
were still'before them,'pushed on till
they came to the river Udda, a very
great river when it passes farther north,
but when w« came to it we found, it
narrow and iordable.
The third day, they 'had either found
their mistake, or had intelligence of
m, and cuwie pouring in upon m to-
wards the dusk of the evening*. We
had, to our great satisfaction, Just
pitched upon a place for our camp,
which was very convenient for the
night; for m we were upon a desert,
though but at the beginning of it, thai
was above live hundred miles over, we
had no town;; to lodge at, and, indeed,
expected none but the city Jaruwena*
which we had yet two day's march to;
the deceit, however, had some (cw
woods in it on this side, and little rU
vers, which ran all into the great river
Udda; it was in a narrow strait, be-
tween little, but very thick wooda, that
we pitched our little camp for that
night, ox peeling to be attacked before
morning.
Nobody knew but ourselves what we
were pursued for: but as it was usual
fot the Mogul 1 altars to go about in
troops in that desert, m the caravans
always fortify themselves every night
against them, as against armies of rob-
bers; and it was therefore no new thing
to be pursued.
But we had this night, of all the
night* of our travels, a most advantar
gcou«icamp; far we lay between two
wood*, with a little livulct running just
before our front, so that we could not
be surrounded, or attacked any way
but iu our front or rear. We took care
also to make our front as strong as we
could, by placing our packs, with our,
camels and horses, all in a line, on the
inside of the river, and felling some
trees in our rear.
In this posture we encamped for the
night; but the enemy was upon us be-
fore we had finished our situation.
They did not come on us like thieves,
as we expected, but sent three messen-
gers to us, to demand the men to be
delivered to them that had abused their
priests, and burned their god Cham
Ohi-Thaungu with fire, that they mklil
burn thera with fire; and upon info,
they said, they woujd go away, and

body dki it. The leader of the cara-
van sent word he was well assured t hat-
it was not. done by. any of our camp9
that we were peaceable merchants,
travelling'- on., our business j, that we
had done, no harm to them or to any
one. '.else.; and that, therefore, they
must; look .farther for their enemies
who had injured them, for we were not
the-people; so desired them not to
disturb us, for, if they did, we should
defend ourselves.
They were far from being* satisfied
with this for an answer$ and a great
crowd of them came running' down in
the morning, by break of day, to our
camp; but seeing us in such an unac-
countable situation, they durst come
no farther than the brook in our front,
where they stood, and showed us
such a number that indeed terrified
us very much; for those that bpoke
least of them, spoke of ten thousand.
Here they stood and looked at us a
while, and then setting up a great howl,
they let fly a cloud of arrows among
us; but we were well enough fortified
for that, for we sheltered under our
baggage, and 1 do not remember that
one of us was hurt.
Some time after this, we saw them
move a little to our right, and expect-
ed them on the rear; when a cunning
fellow, a Cossack of Jarawena, in the
pay of the Muscovites, calling" to the
leader of the caravan, said to, him, Fll
go send all these people away to
Siheilka; this was a city four or ire
days' journey at least to the right, and
rather behind us. So he takes his
bow and arrows, and getting on horse-
back/ he rifles away from our rear
directly, as, it were" back to Nertsin-
skay; after this, he takes a great cir-
cuit about, and comes directly on the
army of the Tartars, as if he had been
sent express to tell them a long story,
that the, people who had burnt .the
Cham , Chi-Thaungu were gone to
Siheilka, with a caravan of miscreants,
as -he called them, .that is to. say,
Christians 5 and that they had resolved
to. burn -the god Schal-Isar, belonging
lo.theTongueses.
  As this fellow was himself a mere
Tartar "tad- perfectly spoke their lan-
guage* he .counterfeited so well, thai
they -all took it from him, and away-
they drove in a most violent hurry to
Siheilka, which,-it seems, was five days
journey to the north; and in less than
three hours they were entirely out
of our sight, and we never heard any
more of "them, nor whether they went
to Siheilka or no. So we passed away
safely on to Jarawena, where there was
a garrison of Muscovites, and there
we rested five days 5 the caravan being*
exceedingly fatigued with the last
clay's hard inarch, and with want of
rest in the night., , -
From this city we had a frightful
desert, which held us twenty-three
days* march. We furnished ourselves
with some tents here, for the better
accommodating ourselves in the night 5
and the leader of the caravan procured
sixteen carriages, or waggons of the
country, for carrying our water or pro-
visions; and these carriages were our
defence, every night round our little
camp; so that had the Tartars ap-
peared, unless they had been very
numerous indeed, they would not have
been able to hurt us.
We may well be supposed to want
re*t again after this long journey; for
in this desert we neither saw house-
nor tree, and scarce a bush; though
we saw abundance, • of the sable hun-
ters, who are all Tartars of the Mogul
Tartary, of which this country is a
part 5 and they frequently attack,
small caravans, but we saw no numbers
of them together.
After we had passed this desert, we
catne into a country pretty well inha-
bited; that is to say, we found towns
and castles, settled by the Czar of
Muscovy, with garrisons of stationary
soldiers, to protect the caravans, and
defend the country against the Tartars,
who would otherwise make it very
dangerous travelling; and his czarish
majesty has gi?en such strict orders
for the well guarding the caravahs and
merchants, that, • if' there are any
Tartars heard of in the country, de-
tachments of, the garrisons are always
sent to see the travellers safe from
station to station. And thus the
governor of Adinsko?, whom 1 .had
an opportunity to make a visit to*, by
means-.of the Scpte. merchant, who
robinson cnumm*
MB'S
 
wis acquainted with lum, offered us a
guard of fifty men, if we thought there
was ail? danger, to the next station.
I thought, long before this, that as
we catne nearer to Europe we should'
find the country better inhahitcd, unci
the people more civilised; but 1 found
myself mistaken in both; for we had
yet the nation of the Tongueses to pass
through, where we saw the same to-
kens of paganism and barbarity m be-
fore; only, as they were conquered by
the Muscovites, they were not so dan-
gerous; hut for rudeness of manners,
and idolatry, no people in the world
ever went beyond them; they are
clothed all in skins of beasts, and their
houses are built of the same; you
know not a man from a woman, neither
by the ruggedness of their counte-
nances nor their clothes; and in the
winter, when the ground is covered
with snow, they live under-ground in
vaults, which have cavities going from
one to another, 
If the Tartars had their Chain Chi-
Thaungu for a whole village or coun«
try, these had idols in every hut and
every cave: besides, they worship the
stars, the sun, the water, the snow,
and, in a word, every thing they do
not understand, and they understand
but very little; so that every element,
every uncommon thing, sets them
a*saerificing. I met with nothing
peculiar to myself in all this country,
which 1 reckon was, from the desert I
spoke of last, at least four hundred
miles, half of it being another desert,
which took us tip twelve days severe
travelling, without; house or tree;
and we "were obliged again to carry
our own provisions, as well water
as bread. After we were out of this
desert, and had travelled two days, we
came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or
station on the great river Janezay,
which, they told us there, parted
Europe from Asia.
Here I observed ignorance and
paganism still prevailed, except in the
Muscovite garrisons; all the country
between the river Oby and the river
Janezay is as entirely pagan, and the
people as barbarous, as the remotest
tof the Tartars | »ay» as- any 'nation,
,. for might 1 know, in Ask or America.
I also found, which I observed to
the Muscovite governors whom 1
bud an opportunity to converse with,,-
that the poor pagans are not much
wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being
under the Muscovite government;
which they acknowledged was true
enough; but that, as they said, was none
of their business; that if the easar ex**
peeled to convert hi? Siberian, Ton-
guesc, or Tartar subjects, it should be
done by sending clergymen among
them, not soldiers; and, they added,
with more sincerity than ! expected*
that they found it was not so much
the concern of their monarch to
make the people Christians as it mm
to make thein subjects.
From this river to the great river
Oby, we crossed a wild uncultivated
country, barren of people and good
management, otherwise it is in Itself
a most pleasant, fruitful, \ni agree-
able country. What inhabitants we
found in it are all pagan?, except
such ab are sent among them from
Russia: for this m the country, I
mean on both sides the river Oby,
whither the Muscovite criminals that
are net put to death are banished, ami
from whence it is next to impossible
they should ever come away.
1 have nothing material to say of
my particular affairs till I came to
Tobolsk*!, the capital city of Liberia,
where 1 continued some time on the
following occasion.
We had now been almost seven months
on our journey, and winter began to
come on apace; whereupon my part-
ner and ! called a council about our
particular affairs, in which we found
It proper, as we were bound for En-
gland, and not for Moscow, to
consider how to dispose of our*
selves. They told its of sledges
and rein deer to carry us over the
snow in the winter time: and, indeed*
they have such things that it would
be incredible to relate the particulars
of, by which means the Etissiatts
travel more in the winter than-they can
in summer, as in these sledges'-they
are abte to run night ami day;'-tie

ADVENTURES OF
and hard as a stone, and they run
upon the surface, without any regard
to what is underneath.
Hut 1 had no occasion to push at
a winter journey of this kind; 1 was
bound to England, not to Moscow,
and my route lay two ways; either
1 must" go on as the caravan went,
till 1 came to Jaroslaw, and then go
off west for Narva, and the gulf of
Finland and so to Dantzic, where I
might possibly sell my China cargo
to good advantage; or ! must leave
the" caravan tit a little town on the
jDwintt* from whence I had but mx
days by water to Archangel, and
from thence might be sure of ship-
ping either to England, Holland, or
'Hamburgh.
Now, "to go any of these journeys
in the winter would have been pre-
posterous ^ for as to Dantzic, the
Baltic would have been frozen tip,
and I could not g#! passage; and to
go by land in those countries wits
fer less safe than among the Mogul
Tartars; likewise, to go to Archangel
in October, all the ships would fie
gone from thence, and even the mer-
chants who dwell there in summer
retire south to Moscow in the winter
when the ships are gone; so that 1
could have nothing but extremity of
cold to encounter, with a scarcity of
provisions, and must lie in an empty
town all the winter; so that, upon
the whole, I thought it much my bet-
ter way to let the caravan go, and
make provision to winter where 1
was, at Tobolski, in Siberia, in the
latitude of about sixty degrees, where
1 was sure of three things to wear out
a cold winter with, viz. plenty of pro-
visions, such as the country afforded,
a warm house, with fuel enough, and
excellent company.
1 was now in a quite different cli-
mate from my beloved island, where
I never felt cold except when I had
my ague; on  the contrary,  1 had
much to do to bear any clothe? on toy
hack, and never tnade< any Ire but
without doors, which was necessary
for dressing my food, &c Now I
made<me three good vests, with' large
•tobe* or- gowns over them, to hang
ti6witto:tfte feet, and button'dose to
the wrists; and all these lined with
furs, to make them sufficiently
wan n.
As to a wr^itj house, ! mu?t con-
fess I greatly disliked our way in
England of making fires in every
room in the house in open ehirn-
nies, which, •when the fire was out,
always kept the air in the room
cold as the climate; but taking an
apartment in a good house in' the
town, 1 ordered a chimney to be built
like a furnace, in the centre of six
several rooms, like a stove; the funnel
to carry the smoke went up one way,
the door to come at the fire went in
another, and all the rooms were kept
equally warm, but no fire seen, just
as they heat the bagnios in England.
By tliis means, we had always the
same climate in all the room?, and an
equal heat was preserved; and how
cold soever it was without", it was
always warm within; and yet we saw
no fire, nor were ever incommoded
with smoke.
The most wonderful thing of all
was, that it should be possible to meet
with good company here, in a coun-
try so barbarous its that of the most
northerly parts of Europe, near the
frozen ocean, within but a very few
degrees of Nova Zembla. But this
being the country were the state
criminals of Muscovy, as 1 observed
before, are all banished, this city
was full of noblemen, gentlemen,
soldiers, and courtiers of" Muscovy.
Here was the famous prince Gallit-
zen, the old "'general Robostiskl, and
several other persons of note, and
some ladies. By means of my- Scots
merchant, whom, nevertheless, I
parted with here, 1 made an1 ae*
quaintance with several of these gen-
tlemen; and from these, in the' long
winter nights in which 1 staid here,
I received several very agreeable visits.
If was talking one night with prince^
—, one of the banislied ministers of
state belonging to the Czar 'of Mus-
covy, that the discourse of mf parti-
cular case began. He had been telling
me abundance of fine things of the
greatness, the magnificence, the dorti*
nions, and the absolute power'of the
eiiip&or 'of" the Ittsitos: I'lm**
 
 
 
 
m
 
rupted him, awl told 1*1 in 1 was a
greater and more pow^rl'sil prince than
evett the Cor of Mustuvy was,, though
uiy dominions were not mj largo, or
my people so main*. The Russian
grandee 'looked a little surprised, and
fixing his eyes steadily uporMue, began
to wonder what 1 meant. I told h«m
his wonder would reuse when J had
explained myself. First, I told him 1
had absolute disposal of the live* and
fortunes of all my subjects; that not-
withstanding my absolute power, 1 had
not one person' disaffected to my go-
vernment, or to my person, in all my
dominions. Uc shook his head at
that, anil said, there, indeed, 1 outdid
the Czar of Muscovy. 1 told him
that all the lauds in my kingdom were
my own, and all my subjects were not
only my tenants, hut tenants fit will;
that I hey would all fight for inc to tin.1
liii>t drop; arid that never tyrant, for
such 1 acknowledged myself to be,
was ever so universally beloved, and
yet so horribly feared by his subjects.
After amusing him with these rid-
dles in government fvT a while, I
opened the case, and told him the
story at large of my living in the
island; and how 1 managed both my-
self and the people that were wider
me, just as 1 have since minuted it
down. They were exceedingly taken
with the story, and especially the
prince, who* told me, with a sigh*,, that
the true greatness of life was to be
masters of ourselves; that lie would
wot have exchanged such a state of
life as iniiie to be Czar of Muscovy;
and that he found more felicity in the
retirement lie seemed to be banished
to there, than ever lie found in the
highest authority lie enjoyed in the
court of his master, the czar; that
the height of human wisdom was to
bring our tempers down to our cir-
cumstances, and to male a calm
within, under the weight of the great-
est storms without. When lie came
first hither, he said lie used to tear the
hair from his head, and the clothes
from his back, as others had done be-
fore him | but a little time and con-
sideration had made him look into
himself, as..well as round himt to
tSitg3 without; that he -fotuid the
mind of man, if it was htft once
brought to ivfleet upon the state of
u»met>al life, and how little this world
was concerned it' its true felicity, vtas
perfectly capable of making" a felicity
for itself, fully sati-lviug to itself,
and, suitable to its own best ends and
(icon's, with but very little assistance
from the world; the air to breathe jn,
food to sustain life, clothes for warmth,
and lihcMy for exercise, in order to
heahh, completed, in his opinion, all
that tiit* world could do for us; and
though ihe greatness, the authority,
(he riches, and the pleasures which
some enjoyed in the world, had much
in them that- was agreeable to its, yet
all those things chiefly gratified the
coarsest of our alVections, such as our
ambition, our particular pride, avarice,
vanity, and senwnality; all which being"
the mere product of the, worst part of
man, were in themselves crimes, anil
had in them the seeds of all manner
of crimes; but neither were related
to, nor concerned with, any of those
virtues that constituted us wise men,
or of those graces that distinguished
us as Christians; that being now de-
prived of all the fancied felicity winch
he enjoyed in the full exercise of all
those vices, he said he was at leisure
to look upon the dark ndc of them,
where lie found all manner of defor-
mity, and was now convinced that
virtue only makes a man truly wise,
rich, and great, and preserves him in
the way to a superior happiness in ft
future state; and in this, lie said, they
were more happy in their banishment
than all their enemies were, who had
the full possession of ail the wealth
and power they had left behind them.
Nor, sir, says*tie, do 1 bring n^ mind
to this politically, by the necessity of
my circumstances, which some call
miserable; but, if 1 know any thing
of myself, 1 would not now go back,
though the czar my master should call
me, and reinstate me in all my former
grandeur: I say, I would no more g#
back to it than 1 believe my soul, when
it shall be delivered from this prison
of the body, and lias had a taste'of the
glorious state beyond life, would c#»c
back to the gaol of flesh' and blood it
is now enclosed in» and leafe.hoftron,

ADVENTOBIS OF
 
wight be evm ferccived in bis counte-
nance $ nor could he immediately an-
iwer me' when 1 had dtfne, and as
It were hesitated what he would say
to it: but after he had paused a little,
lie-'embraced - me, and said, how un-
happy 'are we, unguarded creatures
as weare, .that even our greatest acts of
friendship are made snares unto us,
'»id we are made tempters of one
another! My dear friend, said ^he,
our offer is so sincere* as such kind-
ness k it, is so disinterested in itself,
and is to calculated for my advantage,
that I must have ?ery little knowledge
of the world if 1 did not both wonder
at it, and acknowledge the obligation
i have upon me to you for it ^ But did
you believe I was sincere in what 1
have often said to you of my contempt
of the world? Did you believe 1 spoke
my very soul to you, and that I
had realty obtained that degree of feli-
city here that had placed me above ail
that the world could give* me? Did
you believe 1 was sincere when I told
you 1 would not go back, if 1 was re-
called even to be all that 1 once was
in the court, with the favour of the
czar mv master? Did you believe
ine,:my friend, to be an honest man;
or did you believe me to be a boasting
hypocrite? Here lie stopped, as if he
would hear what 1 would say; but,
indeed, ! soon after perceived that he
•stopped because Ms spirits were in
motion, his great heart was full of
struggles, and he could not go on.
1 was, 1 confess, astonished at the
thing as well as at the man, and 1
used some arguments with him to
urge him to set himself free; that
:lie ought to look upon this as a floor
opened by Heaven for Ms deliverance,
and a summons by Providence, who
has the care and disposition of all
event*?, to do himself good, and
•to'''render Mtaself useful in the
world,
'  lie had by this time recovered
"himself; how do'you know, sir, says
•he 'warmlv, bur that  Instead of a
'''Summons from'Heaven, it may be a
feint of another "instrument $ ' repre-,
tenting :M- altering' coloursi;:to 'me
fhe;»hbtf of felicity-as a ddifetaMce,
which may in itself be my snare, aid
tend directly to my ruin? If ere ! am
free from the temptation of returning
to my former miserable greatness;
there 1 am not sure but that ail the
seeds of pride, ambition, avarice,
and luxury, which I know remain in
nature, may revive and take root, and,
in a word, again overwhelm me; and
then the happy prisoner, whom you
see now master of his soul's liberty,
shall be the miserable slave of his
own senses, in the full of all personal
liberty. Dear sir, let me remain in
this blessed confinement, banished
from the crimes of life, rather than
purchase a show of freedom at the
expense of the liberty of my reason,
and at the future happiness which I
now have in ray view, but shall then,
1 fear, quickly lose sight of; for 1 am
but flesh; a man, a mere man: have
passions and affections as likely to pos-
sess and overthrow me as any man:
0 be not my friend and tempter both
together.
If 1 was surprised before, I was
tpiite dumb now, anil stood silent,
looking at him, and, indeed, admiring
what 1 saw. The struggle in his soul
was so great, that though the weather
was extremely cold, it put him into a
most violent sweat, and I found -lie
wanted to give vent to his mind; so
1 said a word or two, that i would
leave him to consider of it, and wait
on him again, and then 1 withdrew to
my own apartment.
About two hours after, 1 heard
somebody at or near the door of
my room, and ! was going to open the
door, but he had opened it, and came
in. My dear friend, says he, you
had almost overset me, but 1 am 're-
covered. l)o not take it Ml that 1
do not close with your offer; 1 assure
you it is not for want of sense of the
Kindness of it in you $ and 1 came to
make the 'most sincere acknowledge*
.ment of it to you; but 1 hope 1 have
•got the Yictory over myself.—My lord,
said 1,1 hope* you are' folly satisied
thai-yon do not resist' the call .of
Heaven.-—Sir, said he, if it had''been
from Heaven, the same'power would
have inlueflcM me to have accepted
m
 
it: but 1 iidpe, and am fully satisfied,
that it is from Heaven that I decline
itj and 1 have infinite satisfaction
in the parting, that you shall leave
me an honest man still, though not a
free mail.
1 had nothing to do but to acquiesce,
and make professions to him of my
having no end in it but a sincere de-
sire to serve him. lie embraced me
?ery passionately, and assured me
lie was sensible of that, and should
always acknowledge it; and with thai
he offered me a very fine present of
sallies, too much, indeed, for ine to
accept from a man in his cireuiiistan-
ces, and 1 would have avoided
them, but he would not be refused.
The next morning 1 sent* my ser-
vant to his lordship with a small pre-
sent of tea, and two pieces of China
damask, and four little wedges of
Japan gold, which did not all weigh
above 'six ounces or thereabout, but
were far short of the value of his
sables, which, when 1 came to En-
gland, I found worth near two hun-
dred pounds. He accepted the tea, and
one piece of the damask, and one of the
pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp
upon it, of the Japan coinage, which
1 found he took for the rarity of
it, but would not take any more;
and he sent word by my servant that
he desired to speak with me.
When 1 came to him, lie told me
I knew what had passed between us,
and hoped 1 would not move him
any more in that affair; but that,
since 1 had wade such a generous
offer to him, he asked me if. 1 had
kindness enough to offer the same to
another person that he would name to
ine, in whom he had a great share of
concern, i told him that 1 could riot
say I inclined to do so much for any
but himself, for whom 1 had a par-
ticular value, and should have been
glad to have been the instrument of
his deliverance j however, if he would
please to name the person to me, 1
would give him my answer. He told
me it was his only son; who though 1
had not seen him, yet he was in the
same condition, with himself, and
above two hundred miles Croni him,
©a the other side of the Oby -, but that
if 1 consented, he would tend for
him.
1 made no hesitation, but told him 1
would do it. I made some ceremony
in letting him understand that it was
wholly on his account; and that seeiaf
I could not prevail on him, 1 woulu
show my respect to him by my con-
cern for*his son; but these*things are
too tedious to repeat here. He sent
away the next day for his son; and in
about twenty days he came back with
the messenger, bringing six or seven
horses loaded with very rich furs, and
which, iii the whole, amouuted to a
very great value, His servants brought
the horses into the town, but left the
young lord at a distance till night,
when he came incognito into our
apartment, and his father presented
him to ine, and, in short, we concerted
the manner of our travelling, and
every thing proper for the journey.
1 'had bought a considerable quan-
tity of sables, black fox skins, ine
ermines, and such other furs as are
very rich, in that city, in exchange for
some of the goods 1 had brought from
China; in particular for the cloves and
nutmegs, of which 1 sold the greatest
part here, and the rest afterwards at
Archangel, for a, much better price
than I could have, got at London;
, and my partner, who was sensible of
the profit, and whose business more
particularly than mine was merchan-
dise, was mightily pleased with our
stay, on account of the traffic we made
here.
It was the beginning of June when
I left this remote place, a city, I be-
lieve, little heard of in the world;
and, indeed, it is so far out of the road
of commerce, that I know not how it
should be much talked of. We were
now reduced to a very small caravan,
having only thirty-two horsei , and
camels in all, and all of them passed
for mine, though my new guest wm
proprietor of eleven of them; it was
most natural also that I should take
more gerfanfi with me than, 1 had
before.; and the young lord passed,for
my steward; what great man 1 paased
for myself, 1 know'not, neither did it
concern me, to, iaqui«# We ,h«f. here

we should advance to those frees, and

us in a body; it was, indeed, my obi
Portuguese pilot who proposed it. and
who had tliib excellency attending him,

apt to direct and encourage us in earns
of the most danger. We. advanced im-
mediateiy.with what speed we coubLand

them, keeping their stand, and not
attempting to hinder us. When we

a very great spring of water, which
running out in a little brook, was*, a
little farther, joined by another of the

of a considerable river, called after-
wards the VVinska: the trees which
grew about this spring were not above
two hundred, but very large, and stood
pretty thick, bo that as soon m we got
in we saw ourselves perfectly safe
from the enemy, unless they attacked

While we staid here waiting the mo-
tion of" the enemy some hours, without
perceiving they made any movement,
our Portuguese, with some help, cut
several arms of trees half off, and laid
them hanging across from one tree to
another, and in a manner fenced us in.

ADVENTURES Of
sure to take good mm; we bade lilin
give the word'of command, which he
delayed so long, that they were some
of them within two pikes length of us
when we lei fly. We aimed so true
that we killed 'fourteen of them, and
wounded several others, as also several
of their horses; for we had all of us
loaded our pieces with two or three
bullets at least.
They were terribly surprised with
our fire, and retreated immediately
about one hundred rods from us, in
which time we loaded our pieces again,
and seeing them keep that distance,
we sallied out, and catehed four or five
of their horses, whose riders we sup-
posed were killed; and coming, up to
the dead, we judged they were Tar-
tars, but knew not how they came to
make an excursion such an unusual
length.
We slept little, you may be sure,
but spent the most part of the night
in strengthening our situation, unci
barricading the entrances into the
wood, and keeping a strict watch.
We waited for day-Tight, and when it
came, it gave us a very unwelcome dis-
covery, indeed; for the enemy, who
we thought were discouraged with the
reception they met with, were now
greatly increased, and had set up
eleven or twelve huts or tents, as -if
they were resolved to besiege us; and
this little camp they had pitched upon
the open plain, about three quarters
of a mile from us. We were, indeed,
surprised at this discovery; and now,
I confess, 1 gave myself over for lost,
and aU^that I^hadj the loss of my
tffecte did not lie so near me, though
very considerable, as the thoughts "of
Mkng into the'hands of 8uch'"barba-
rjfttt*, at the latter end of my journey,
ttfterso many difficulties and hazards
at, find gone through, and even in
s^jjfbt of our port, where we expected
safety and deliverance. As to my
partner, he was raging, and declared
that to lose his goods would be his
ruin, and that he would rather die
than be starved; and he was for fight-
ing to the last drop*
The young lord, a gallant youth,
was for lighting to the last alsoj and
my old pilot was of the opinion we
 
were able to resist them all in the
situation we were then in; and thus
we spent the day in debates of what
we should do: but towards evening
we found that the number of our
enemies still increased, and we did not
know but by the morning they might
still be a greater number $ so I began
to inquire of those people we had
brought from Tobolsk!, if there were
no private ways, by which we might
avoid them in the night, and perhaps
retreat to some town, or get help to
guard us over the desert, 'The .Sibe-
rian, who was servant to the young
lord, told us, if we designed to*avoid
them, and not fight, lie would engage to
carry us oil" in the night, to a way that
went north, towards the river Petrou,
by which lie made no question but we
might get away, and the Tartars never
the wiser; but, he said, his lord had
told him he would not retreat, he
would rather choose to fight. I told
him he mistook his lord;"for that he
was too wise a man to love fighting for
the sake of it; that 1 knew his'lord
was brave enough, by what lie had
showed already; but that bis lord
knew better than to desire seventeen or
eighteen men to fight fi?e hundred, un-
less an unavoidable necessity forced
them to it; and that, if he thought it
possible for m to escape in the night,
we had nothing eke to do but to" at-
tempt it. He answered, if his lord-
ship gave him such orders he would
lose his life if he did not perform it;
we soon brought his lord to give that
order, though privately, and we imme-
diately, prepared for the putting it in
practice.
And, first, as soon as it began to be
dark, we kindled a fire in our little
camp, which we kept burning, and
prepared so as to make it burn all
night, that the Tartars might conclude
we were still there; but'as.toon a* it
.was dark, and we could see the stars
(for our guide would not stir before),
having ail oar horses and camels ready
loaded, we followed our new guide,
who 1 soon found steered himself by
the north star.
After we had travelled two hours
very hard, it began u be lighter still;
not .that U was quite dark all night,
2!IS
 
but the moon began to rise, so thai.
In short, it was rather lighter than we
wished it to be; but by six o'clock the
next morning' we were got above thirty
miles, having almost spoiled our
horses. Here we found a Russian vil-
lage, named Kermazinskoy, where we
rested, and heard nothing of the Kal-
muck Tartars that day/ About two
hours before night we set out again,
and travelled till eight the next morn-
ing, though not quite so hard as be-
fore; and about seven o'clock we
passed a little river, called Kirtza,
and came to a good large town inha-
bited by Russians, called Ozoinoys;
there we heard that several troops of
Kalmucks had been abroad upon the
desert, but that we were now com-
pletely out of clanger of them, which
was to our great satisfaction. Here wc
were obliged to get some fresh horses;
and having need enough of rest, we
staid five days; and my partner and I
agreed to give the honest Siberian who
brought lis thither the value of ten
pistoles.
In five days more we carnc to Vens-
lima,  upon tlte river Wirtzogda, and
running into the Pwina: we were
there, 'very happily, near the end of
our travels by land, that river being
navigable, in seveii days' passage, to
Archangel. From henee we came to
Lawrenskoy the 3d of July; and pro-
viding ourselves with two luggage-
boats, and a barge for own conve-
nience, we embarked the 7th, and ar-
rived all safe at Archangel the 18th;
having been a year, five months, and
three days on the journey, including
our stay of eight months at Tobolsk!.
We were obliged to stay at this place
six weeks for the arrival of the
•hips, and must have tarried longer had
not a Ham burgher come in above a
month sooner than any of the English
8hip's; when after some consideration
that the city of Hamburgh might hap-
pen to be aa good a market for our
goods as London, we all took freight
with him; and, having put our goods
on board, it was most natural for me to
put my steward on board to take care
of them; by which means my you'rig
lord had a sufficient opportunity to
conceal himself, never coining on shore
again nil the time we staid there; and
this lie did that he might not be seen
in the city, where some of tin? Moscow
merchants would certainly have seen
nnd discovered him.
We then set sail from Archangel the
20th of August the same year; and
after no extraordinary bail voyage, ar-
rived safe in the lilbe the 18th of Sep-
tember, f fere my partner and I found
a very good sale for our goods, as well
those of (Jhinaas the sables, &e, of Si-
beria; and dividing'the produce, my
share amounted to H-ifhL 17*. 3d. in-'
eluding about six- hundred pounds
worth 'of diamonds' which 1 purchased
at Bengal.
Here the young lord took his leave
of us, and went tip tiie Kibe, in order
to go the court of Vienna, where he
resolved to seek protection, and could
correspond with those of his father's
friends who were left alive. We did
not part without testimonies of grati-
tude for the1 service 1 had clone him,
and his sense of iny kindness to the
prince his father.
To conclude, having staid near- four
months in Hamburgh,' I came from
thence by land to the Hague, where 1
embarked in the packet, and arrived;la
London the 10th of January, 1-705;
having been absent from England, ten
years and nine months. And her* 1
resolved to prepare for a longer jour-'
ney than all these, having lived a' life
of infinite variety^ seventy-two ye«s,
and' learned -sufficiently to know-- the
value of retirement, and the 'blessing
of ending our days • in peace. ''
 
THE END.
THE
JLi 1 X l4j O X 1j Jo X O hj»
The lives of literary men are generally passed In the obscurities of the closet,
which conceal, even from friendly inquiries, the artifices of study, whereby
each may have arisen to eminence. Whether the author of Robinson
€Rf/so£ was born on the continent, or in this island, in London, or in the
country; was uncertain. And whether his name was Foe or De I?oe was
somewhat doubtful. It is at length known with sufficient certainty, that he was
the son of James Foe, of the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, London, citizen
and botcher; who was himself the son of Daniel Foe of Elton, Northampton-
shire, yeoman, and who obtained his freedom by serving- his apprenticeship
with John Levit, citizen and butcher. Our author was admitted to his freedom
by birth on the 26th January, 1687-8. The concluding sentiment of The True
Born Englishman, we now see was then as natural, as it ever will be ju.st.
Then, let us boast of ancestors no more.
For fame of families is all a cheat;
? Tie personal virtue only makes us great.
According to the Gazette, Daniel Foe, or De Foe, as he is said by his enemies
to have called himself that he might not be thought an Englishman, was born
in London, about the year 1663,-^His family were probably Dissenters, among
whom he received no unlettered education; at least it is plain, from his various
writings, that he was a zealous defender of their principles, and a strenuous
supporter of their politics, before the liberality of our rulers in church
and state had freed this conduct from danger. He merits the praise
which is due to sincerity in manner of thinking and to uniformity in
habits of acting, whatever obliquy may have been cast on bis name, by
attributing writings to him, which, as* they belonged to others, he was studious to
disavow.
Our author was educated at a dissenting academy, which was kept at
Newington Green by Charles Morton. He delights to praise ** that learned
gentlemen," whose instructive lessons he probably enjoyed from lfi/5 to 1680,
m a master, who taught nothing either in politics, or science, which was
dangerous to monarchial government, or which was improper for a diligent
scholar to know. Being in 3 705 accused by Tutchin. of illiterature, De
Foe archly acknowledged, "I owe this justice to my ancient father,
who is yet living, and in whose behalf I freely testify, that if I am a block-
head, it was nobody's fault but my own, he having spared nothing that
might qualify me to* match the accurate Dr. B—«— or the most learned
Tutchin^
De Foe was born a writer, as other men are born generals and statesmen:
and when he was not twenty-one, he published, in 1683, a pamphlet again*!
.« very prevailing sentiment in favour of the Turks, as opposed to tits
 
THE LIFE (If DE FOE. mj
Austrian*; lit was a matt who would %tit as well as write for his principles;
and before lie was three*and-twenty he appeared in anus for the Dutte of
Monmouth, in June 1685, Of this exploit he boasts itt his latter years,
when if was no longer dangerous to avow his participation in that imprudent
enterprise, with greater men of similar principles.
Having escaped from the dangers of battle, and from the fan^s of
JcflFry's, De Foe found complete security i» the more gainful pursuits of
peace. Vet, lie was prompted by life y.eal to mingle in the Controversies of
the reign of James 2nd. whom he efficaciously* opposed, by warning the
dissenters of the secret danger of the insidious tolerance, which was offered
by the monarch's bigotry, or by the minister's artifice,, When our author
collected his writings, lie did not think proper to re-publish either his tract
against the Turks, or his pamphlet against the King.
De Foe was admitted a Liveryman of London on the 26th. of January,
1687—-S, when, being allowed his freedom by birth, lie was received a member
of that eminent corporation. As lie had endeavoured to promote the
revolution by his pen and Ids sword, he had the satisfaction of partaking
ere long, in the pleasures and advantages of that great event. During
. the hilarity of that moment, the Lord Mayor of London asked king William
to purtake of the city feast on the 2.9th. of October, J68!l. Every  honour
was  paid thq .sovereign of the people's choice, A regiment of volunteers
composed of .the chief citizens,, and commanded by the celebrated Earl of
Peterborough, attended the King and Queen from Whitehall to the Mansion*
house. Among these troopers, gallantly mounted, and richly accoutred, was
Daniel -De Foe, if we pay believe* Oidmixon.
While our author thus displayed his zeal, and courted notice, he is said to
have acted as a hosier, in Freeman's~yard, (Jorahili: but the hosier and tie poet
are very irreconcileabie characters. With the usual imprudence of superior
genius, he was carried by his vivacity into companies who were gratified by
his wit. He spent those hours with a small society for the cultivation of
polite learning, which be ought to have employed in the calculations of the
counting-house: ami being obliged to abscond from his creditors in 1692, lie
iiatiirally attributed- those misfortunes to the war, which were< probably
owing to hi* own misconduct. An angry creditor took out I commission of
bankruptcy, which was soon superseded on the petition of those to whom he
was most indebted, who accepted a composition on his single bond*  This he
punctually paid by the efforts of unwearied1 diligence. But some-of those
creditors,, who had "been thus satisfied, falling afterwards into' distress them-
selves, De Foe voluntarily paid them their whole claims; being then hr ritiitg
circumstances froiti King William's favour. This if such an example^ of
honesty as it would be unjust to De Foe and to the world to conceal: -Being
jreproiehtd in 1705' by Lord Haversham,. with- mercenarinesf,.' our' author
feelingly mentions; "flow, with a numerous family, and no helps "brnVuis
own inuustry, he had forced his way with undiscwiragcd diligence;, through a
sea-'of misfortunes, and reduced his debts, exclusive of - composition^ from
seventeen thousand to less than .Jive thousand pounds." He cotttmued'ty
carry oa the pantile works near Tilbury Fort though probably with"no great
success., It was afterwards, sarcastically said, that he Hi -not, like the- 'Egypt-

have procured business' by his' care, and accumalated wealth without a risk;
but, «s he assures us in liis old age, Providence, which had (Piker work for Mm
t& do, placed a secret aversion fa Ms mind to quitting England, He had con-
fidence enough in his own talents to think, that on this field lie could gather
laurels, or at least gain a livelihood.
Jii a projecting age, as our author denominates King William's reign, he was
himself a projector. While he was yet young, l')e Foe was prompted by a
vigorous mind to think of many schemes, and to ofleY, what was most pleasing
to the ruling powers, mays and means for carrying on the war. He wrote, as
he says, many sheets' about the coin; lie proposed a register for seamen, long
before the act of parliament tens thought of; he projected county hanks, and
factories for goods; lie mentioned a proposal for a commission of inquiries into
hanliritpts* estates; lie contrived a pension office for the relief of ike poor.
At length, in January 1 (>!)(»-J\ he published his Essay upon Projects; which
he dedicated to Palby Thomas, not as a commissioner of glass duties, under
whom lie then served, or as a friend, to whom he acknowledges obligations;
but as the most .proper judge on the subject. It is always curious to trace a
thought, in order to see where it first originated, or how It was afterwards ex-
panded. Among other projects, which shew a wide range of knowledge, he
suggests to King William the imitation of Louis XIV,, in the establishment of
a society " for encouraging polite learning, for refining the English language,
and for preventing barbarisms of manners." Prior offered, in 1700, the same
project to King William, in his Carmen Seculare; Swift mentioned in 1710, to
Lord Oxford, a proposal for improving the English tongue; arid Tickcll
flatters himself in his Prospect of Peace, that our daring language shall sport
no more in arbitrary sound. However, his projects were taken, certain it is,
that when l)e Foe ceased to be a trader he was, by the interposition of Dalby
Thomas probably, appointed in 1695, accomptant to the commissioners for
managing the duties on glass; who with our author ceased to act, on the 1st of
August, 1699} when the^tax was suppressed by act of parliament.
fVotn projects of ways and means, De Foe's ardour soon carried him into
the thorny paths of satiric poetry; and his muse produced, in January 1700-1,
The True-bom Englishman. Of the origin of this satire, which was the cause of
much good fortune, but of some disasters, he gives himself the following
account:—" During this time caine out an abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verse,
written by one Mr. Tut chin, and called The Foreigners: In which the author,
who he was I then knew not, fell personally upon the King, then upon the
'Dutch nation, and, after having reproached "his Majesty with crimes that Ms
worst enemies could not think of without horror, he sums up all in the odious
©line of Foreigner. This filled me with a kind of rage against the book, and
gave birth to a trifle, which 1 never could hope should have met with so general
•n acceptation." The sale was prodigious, and probably unexampled; as
SachevereFs trial had not then appeared. The True-born Englishman was
fenswerecl, paragraph by paragraph, in February 1700-1, by a writer, who
brings haste to" apologize for dulness, For this defence of King William and
;the Dutch, 'which was'doubtless circulated by detraction and by power, De Foe
'Was amply rewarded "How this poem was the occasion/' says he,'" of my being
known to his'Majesty; how ! was afterwards received byliim; how employed
abroad; -and how above my capacity of deserving, rewarded, is no' part of the
present ease/* Of the particulars, which the author thus 'declined to tell,
nothing now can be'told.  It is only certain, that he was admitted'to personal
Interviews with the ling, who was no reader of poetry, and that for the royal
favours• De Foe was always grateful,

is certainly a persuasive performance, though we may tmppoac* that many
voters were influenced then by arguments still more persuasive. And he con-
cludes with a sentiment, which how not been too often repeated, That nothing
can make m formidable to our neighbour*, and maintain the reputation of our
nation* but union among ourselves.

peace, tie shall be, glad to quit Flanders for an equivalent." Who at present
doer not wish'that m Foe*s argument'had been in ore studiously react, and-more
efficaciously admitted?' .
  A; scene of sorrow soon after opened, which probably embittered our
author's''future life. 'The death of King William deprived him of a protector,
who, he says, trusted, esteemed, - and much more valued him than lie deserved;
and who,'as he flattered himself amidst his latter distresses, would never have
suffered him to be treated as he had been in the world. Of that monarch'*
memory» he says, that he never patiently heard it abused, nor ever could do
s©'; and1 in this gratitude to a Royal Benefactor there is surely much to praise,
hut nothing to biame.
In the midst of that furious contest of party, civil and religious, which
ensued on the accession of Queen Anne, our author was no unconcerned
spectator. He re-printeci his Enquiry into the occasional Conformity of
Dissenters, which had been 'published "in 1697, with a dedication to Sir
Humphrey Edwin, a Lord Mayor, who having carried the Eegalia to - a
conventicle, gave rise to some wit in The Tale of a Tub, and occasioned some
clauses in an Act of Parliament. De Foe now dedicated his Enquiry to John
How, a dissenting minister, of whom Anthony Wood speaks well. Mr. How
ilid not much care, says Calamy, to enter upon an argument of that nature
with one of so warm a temper as the author of that Enquiry, and contented
himself with publishing some considerations on the Preface of mi Enquiry
'Concerning the occasional conformity of Dissenters.
De Foe's pertinacity soon produced a reply. He out-laughs and out-talks
Mr. How, who had provoked his antagonist's wrath by personal sarcasms, and
who now thought it hard that the old should be shoved off the stage by the
young. De Foe reprobates with the unforbearance of the times, *• this fast
and loose game of religion;" for which he had never met with any considerable
excuse but this, "that this is no conformity in point of religion, but done
as a civil action.** He soon after published another Enquiry in| order to
«hew, that the Dissenters are no ways concerned in occasional conformity.
The controversy, which in those days occasioned such vehement contests
between the two houses of Parliament, is probably silenced for ever.
"During the first fury of highflying," says he, "I fell a sacrifice for
writing against the madness of that high party, and in the service of the
Dissenters." He alludes here to The 'Shortest Way, which he published
towards the end of the year 1/02; and which is apiece of exquisite irony,
though there are certainly passages in it that might have shewn considerate men
how much the author had been in jest. He complains how hard it was, that
this should not have been perceived by all the town, mid that not one mam
can me it, either Church-man or Dissenter. This is one of the strongest
proofs, how much the minds of men were inflamed against each other, and
how little the virtues of mutual forbearance and personal kindness existed
amid the clamour of contradiction, which then shook the kingdom, and gave
rise to some of the most remarkable events in our annals. The Commons
shewed their zeal, however they may ha?e studied their dignity, by prosecuting
several libelists.
During the previous twenty years of his life, De Foe had busied himself
unconsciously in charging a mine, which now blew himself and 'his << family
into .air. lie had fought for Monmouth; he had- opposed1 King Jatnes;
he had vindicated The ftevotution; be had panegrized King William; he had
defended the rights of the collective body of the people; he had displeased
the Treasurer and the General by objecting to the Flanders war; he had
bantered Sir Edward Seymour, and Sir Christopher Musgrave, the Tory leaders
of Jhe Commons; he had just ridiculed all the highflyers in the kingdom r and
he,was at length obliged to seek, for shelter from,the indignation "of-per*oi>*
mi parties, thus overpowering and resistless.
 
THE L#E OF DB FoE, 30f"
 
 A proclamation was Issued in January, 1/02-3, .offering -'a 'reward .of
fifty pounds for discovering his retreat, De Foe was described _ by the Gazette
as a middle sized spare man, about forty years old, of » brown'complexion
and dark brown hair, though he wears a wig, having <a hook nose,, a siprp. cliui,v
grey eyes, and a large mole near his mouth. '.,.;.'
He soon published An Explanation; though he wonders to find their .should
be any occasion for it. "But since ignorance," says lie, "has. led inos.i - in<ea..
to a censure'of the book, mud some people 'are like to come under the dispirit-.,
sure of the government for it; in justice to those who are'in danger to suffer by.
it; in submission to the Parliament and Council who may be offended at it;
and courtesy to all mistaken people, who, it seems, hare not penetrated 'into
the real design; the author presents the world with the genuine meaning of the
paper, which be hopes may allay the anger of government, or at least satisfy
the minds of such as imagine a design to inflame and divide u$." Neither liic
suh'missivencss to the ruling powers, nor his generosity to his printers, was a
sufficient shield from the resentment of his enemies. He was found guilty of
a libel, sentenced to the pillory, and adjudged to be fined and imprisoned. Ttius,
as he acknowledges, was he a second time ruined, and by this affair, as he
asserts, he lost above ^3,500 sterling, which consisted .probably in his brick
works, and in the more abundant product of his pen.
When, by these means, immured in Newgate, our author consoled himself
with the animating reflection, that having meant well, he unjustly suffered.
He had a mind too active to be idle in the solitude of a prison, which is seldom
invaded by visitors. And he wrote a hymn to the pillory, that
Hieroglyphick state machin,
Contrived to punish fancy in.
In this ode the reader will find satire, pointed by his sufferings; generous
sentiments, arising* from his situation; and an unexpected low of easy verse.
For example.
The first intent of laws  ' '
Was to correct.the effect, and check the cause.
And all the ends of punishment
Were only future mischiefs to prevent:
But justice is inverted, when
Those engines of the law,
, Instead of pinching vicious men,
Keep honest ones in awe.
He employed this involuntary leisure in correctingi for the press a
collection of his writings, which, with several things he had no hand in, had'
been already published by a piratical printer. He thought it a most/un-.
accountable boldness in him to print that particular book called The_ Shortest
Way with the Dissenters, while he lay under the public resentment for the
same fact. In. this collection of 1703, there are one-and-twenty treatises in ,
poetry and prose, beginning with The True Born Englishman, and ending',
The Shortest Way to Peace ami Union. To this volume there was preixel ,
the first print of 13e Foe; to which was afterwards added, the apt inscription,
Laudator et alget;
1 In the solitariness of a gaol, the energy of De Foe projected, The Ttevlett.'
This is'a periodical paper in 4to, rwhich was first published on the 111th of';
February, 1703-4; and which was Intended to treat of news, foreign and'
domestic; of politics, British and'European; of trade particular and universal.
But out author foresaw, from the natural aversion of the age to •any tedious^
nfmkr-i that, however profitable, the world would never read, if it were' not'
diterting.   With this design, both  instructive and' atriusing, he skilfully in-
§titite§':ir Sounded €imhp which discusses questions iir'divfaity, morals,, toaiy',
 
trade, language, poetry, love, marriage, drunkenness and gaming. Thus, it Is
easy to see, thai The Review pointed the way to the Tatlers, Spectators,
and Guardians, which maybe allowed however to have treated those interesting
topics with more delicacy of humour, more terseness of ^ style, and greater
depth of learning: yet, has De Foe many passages, both of prose and poetry,
which, for refinement of wit, neatness of expression, and efficacy of moral,
would*do honour to Steele or to Addison. Of ail this was Johnson unconscious
when he speaks of the Tatlers and Spectators as the first English writers, who
had undertaken to reform either the savageness of neglect, or the impertinence
of civility; to shew when to speak, or to be silent; how to refuse, or how to
In the nmktof these labours our author published, in July 1704, The Storm;
or, a collection of the most remarkable casualties, which happened in the
tempest, on the 23rd of November, 1703. In explaining the natural crimes
of wiwhf De Foe shews more science, and in delivering the opinions of the
ancients that this island was more subject to storms than other parts of the
world, he displays more literature than he has been generally supposed to
possess. Our author is moreover entitled to yet higher praise. He seized
that 'awful occasion to inculcate the fundamental truths of religion, the being
of a God, the superintendency of Providence, the certainty of heaven and hell,
the one to reward, the other to punish. #
While, as he tells himself, he lay friend less in the prison of Newgate, ins
family ruined, and himself without hopes of deliverance, a message was
brought him from a person of honour, whom till that time he had not the
least knowledge of. This was no less a person than Sir Robert Hariey, the
Speaker of the House of Commons. Ilarley approved probably of the prin-
ciples and conduct of De Foe, and doubtless foresaw, that; during a factious
afire,'such a genius could be converted to many uses. And he sent a verbal
nVcs'sa^e to the prisoner, desiring to know what'he could do for him. Our author
readily wrote the story of the blind man in the Gospel j concluding, Lord, that
I may receive my sight. t
When the high-flyers were driven from the station, which enabled them to
inflame rather "than conciliate, Hariey became Secretary of State, in April
1704. He had now frequent opportunities of representing the unmerited suf-
ferings of De Foe to the Queen and to the Treasurer; yet, our author con-
tiiiued four months longer in gaol. The Queen, however, inquired into his
circumstances; and Lord Godolphin sent, as he thankfully acknowledges, a
considerable sum to his wife; ami to him, money to pay his fine, and the
expeiiee of his discharge. Here is the foundation, says he, on which he built
hk irst'seiise of duty to the Queen, ant! the indelible bond of gratitude to his
first benefactor. "Let any one say, then," he asks, "what I could have clone,
less or more than I have done for such a Queen and such a benefactor?" All
tills he manfully avowed to the world, when Queen Anne lay lifeless and cold,
as King William, his first patron; and when Oxford, in the vicissitude of
party, had been persecuted by faction, and overpowered, though not conquered,
by violence. n .. . p
Such was the high interposition by which De toe was relieved from
Newgate, in August" 1/04. In order to avoid the town-talk he retired imme-
diately to St. Edmund's Burv: but his retreat did' not prevent persecution.
Dyer, the news writer, propagated that De Foe bad^fled from justice. Fox, the
bookseller, published that he had deserted his security. Stephen, a state mes-
senger every where said that he had a warrant for seizing him. This 1 suppose
 was wit, during the witty age of Anne. In our duller days of law, such out-
rage* would be referred to"the judgment of a jury. De Foe informed the Se-
cretary of State where he was, and when he would appearj but he was told not
to fear, m he had not fraasgressei. Notwithstanding' this vexation, mw

produced in March, 1705, The Cmmlhlttigr; or Memoirs of Sundry Trans-
actions, f rein the World in the Moon. It was one of Do Foe's felicities to
enteh the living mnnnen as they rme, or one of his resource.*, (o shunt fatly m
it flt'W. In the Immr ttw^uasre he applies his satiric tile to the prominences
of every character: of the poets, from Dryden to IVdYy; of the wits, from
Addison to Prior; of the metaphysicians, from Malbraiwhe to Ifoblts; of the
freethinkers, from Asgyll to the Title of a Tub. Our author continually corn*
plains of the iii usage of the world; but with all his aci.iteru^s he did not
advert, thai lie who'"attacks the world, will be by the world attacked. He
makes the lunar politicians debate the policy of Charles XII. in pursuing the
Saxons and Poles, while the Muscovites ravaged Ids own people. I doubt
whether it were on this occasion that the Swedish ambassador was so ill-
advised as to complain against I)e Foe for merited ridicule of u futile warfare.
The" had not then discovered, that the best defence a train «4 the shafts of
satire is to let them fly. Our author's sentiment was expanded by Johnson,
in those energetic lines, which thus conclude the character id* the Swedish
Charles :«—-
"Who left the name, at which the world grew pale,
'i( To point a moral, or adorn a tale."
l)e Foe was so little disturbed by the. appearance of 7'//" Jfww <*ttlf <»r accu-
rate reflections on the CoiiMdidator, that he plunircd into n controversy with Sir
Humphrey AJaekworth abotit his bill for employi/tir the jt</t/r. Tin* had been
passed by "the Commons, with trrcat applause, but received by 1 lie Peers with
suitable caution. De Foe, eofisidexift^flfB/j/^wiW/^^^
represented if, through several Reviews, as h plan which would ruin the industri-
ous, and thereby augment the poor. Sir Humphrey endeavoured, to support hi*
workhouses in every parish, with a parochial capital for carrying on parochial
manufacture. This drew from ])e Foe his admirable treatise, which he entitled
(Jk'htjf alma no Charity, As an English freeholder lie claimed if- m a right, to
address his performance to the House of Commons, having- a particular interest
in the common good; but considering the persons before whom he appeared, be
laid down his archness, and assumed his dignity, fie maintained with wonderful
knowledge of fact and power of argument, the following positions: 1st, That
there is in England more labour than hands to perforin it; and consequently a
want of people, not of employment: 2dly, No man in England of sound limbs
and seines, can be poor merely for want of work, Mlyf All workhouses for
employing the poor, as now they are employed, serve to the rain of families aad
the increase of the poor: 4thlv," It is a regulation of the poor that is wanted, not
a setting th*u« to a work. Longer experience shews this to be a difficult
subject,*" which increases in difficulty with the effluxion of time,
Dc Foe had scarcely dismissed Sir Humphrey, when he introduced Lord Ha*
versham, a ftcrf who is famous in our story, as a maker and publisher of
speeches, His lordship published his speech on the state of the nation in 1705,
which was cried about the town with unusual earnestness. Our author's pru-
dence induced him to give no answer to the speech; but a pamphlet, which was
hawked about the streets and sold for a penny, our author's shrewdness consi-
dered as a challenge' i& every reader. He laughed and talked so much, through 
several Reviews, abotit this factious effusion, as to provoke a defence of topics,
which Ills lordship ought neither to have printed nor spoken. De Foe now pah-
 
 
 
lisfced a Mepjy to Lord Mamrdam9s Vindication of Ms Speech. During well
battles the town never fails to cheer the smaller combatant Our author, with
an allusion to the biography of both, says.sarcastically; "But, fate that makea
footballs of men, kicks some up stairs and some aown; some are advanced
mthout honour, others suppressed without infamy; some are raised without me*
rit, some are crushed without a crime; and no man knows by the beginning' of
thing*, whether his course shall issue in a peerage or a pillory*'
In the midst of these disputes, either grave or ludicrous, De Foe published
Advice to all Parties* He strenuously recommends that moderation and for-
bearance, which his opponents often remarked he was not'so prone to practice
as to preach. While lie thus gave advice to all parties, he conveyed many salu-
tary' lessons to the Dissenters, whom he was zealous to defend. In the Review,
dated the 25th of December 1705, he conjures them for God's sake, if not for
their own gake, to be content. ** Are there a few things more you could wish
were done for jrou? resolve these wishes into two conclusions. 1st Wait till
Providence, if it shall be'for your good, shall bring them to pass; 2dly. Com-
pare the present with the past circumstances, and you cannot repine without the
highest ingratitude both to God and man."
De Foe found leisure, notwithstanding all those labours, perhaps a necessity,
to publish in 1705, a second volume of \he writings of the author of the True
Born Englishman, The same reasons which formerly induced him to collect
some loose pieces, held good, says he, for proceeding to a second volume,
'* That if 1 do not, somebody else will clo it for me/* He laments the scan-
dalous liberty of the press; whereby piratic printers deprive an author of the
native product of his own thought, and the purity of his own style. It is said,
though perhaps without authority, that the vigorous remonstrances of De Foe'
procured the act for the encouragement of learning by vesting the copies of printed
books in the authors or their assigns. The vanity of an administation which
affected to patronise the learned, concurring with the mutual interest of book-
makers and booksellers, produced this salutary law, that our author alone had
called for without success. De Foe's writings, thus collected into volumes,
were soon a third time printed, with the addition of a hey. The satire being now
pointed by the speciication of characters, and obscurities being illuminated by
the annexation of circumstances, a numerous class of readers were, induced,
by their zeal of party, or desire of scandal, to look for gratification from our
authors treatises. He is studious to complain, that kts fPritings had heen
most neglected of then\, who at the same time have owned 'them useful. The
second volume of 1705, containing eighteen treatises m prose and rhyme,
begins with a new discovery of an old intrigue, and ends with Royal
RetMcn.
The fmt If 05 was a year of disquiet to De Foe,, not so muck from the op-
pressions - of state as from the persecutions of party. When Hi business, of
whatever nature, led him to Exeter, and other western towns, in August,
September, and October, 1705, a project was formed to send Mm as a soldier
to the army; at a time when footnten were taken from the coaches as recruits:
but consdbus of his being a freeholder of England, and a liveryman of London,
he knew" that such characters could not be violated, in this nation,, with impu-
nity; When some of the western justices, of more zeal of party than, sense of
duty, heard from' his opponents of De Foe's journey, they determined tO'appre*
hendlum as*y vagabond; but our author, who, among other .qualities, had per-
sonal'courage In a high degree, reflected, that to face danger is roost effectually"
to prevent \%- In his absence, real suits were commenced against him., for ncti- ;.

lie Foe began the year i*70<» with A Hymn to Peace; occasioned by the
two'Houses of Parliament joining in one address to the Queen. On the 4th
of May lie published An Essay" at removing National Prejudice against am
Union teith Scotland, A few weeks after he gave the world a second Essay,
to soften rancour and defeat perversity. But the time was now come, when
lie was to perform what he had often promised; and lus fruitfulneas produced
in July, 1/06, -Jaw Dirhio, a satire against tyranny and passive 'Obedience,
which had been delayed, for fear, as lie declares of parlmmentarir censure.
Of this poem, it cannot be said, as of Thompson's pberty, that it was written
to prove% what no man ever dented. This satire, Bays the preface, had
never been published, though some of it has been a long time in being,-had
not the. world seemed to be going mad a second time with the error of passive
obedience, and non-resistance. And because some men require, says he, more
explicit answers, 1 declare, my belief, that a monarchy, according to the
present constitution, limited by Parliament, and dependant upon km, is not
only the best government in the world, but also the best for this nation »
particular, most'suitable to the genius of the people, and the circumstances of
the whole body. Dryden had given an example a few years before, of argu-
mentative poetry in his Hind "and Panther; by which he endeavoured ^ to t defend
the tenets of the Ohurch of Rome. Our author now reasoned in 'rhyme
through 'twelve books, in defence of every man9s birth-right by nature, when
all sorts of liberty were run down and* opposed. His purpose is doubtlesa
honester than Dryden's; arid his* argument, being in support of the better
euttse, is perhaps superior in strength": but in the" Jure Pimm we look in
vain for
The varying verse, the full resounding line.
The long majestic march, and energy divine.
Our author was soon after engaged in more important, because much more
useful business. Lord Godolphin, who knew how to discriminate character,
determined to employ hitn on an errand, which, as he,says, was far from being
unfit for' a sovereign to direct, or an honest man to perform. ^ By his Lord-
ship he was carried to the Cjueen, who said to him, while he kissed her hand,
that she had such a satisfaction in his former services, that she had again ap^
printed him for another affair, which teas something nice, but'the .treasurer
would tell Mm the rest. In three days he was sent to Scotland His knowledge
of commerce and revenue, his powers of insinuation, and above all his readiness
of pen, were deemed of no small utility in promoting the Union, He arrived'
at Edinburgh, in October, 1706. And* we shall find Mm no inconsiderable
actor in tte performance of that greatest of all good works* He attended^the
Committees of Parliament, for whose use he made several of the calculations
on the subject of trade and taxes. He complains, however, that when after-
wards some clamour was raised upon the inequality of the proportions, and
the contrivers began to be blamed, and a little threatened a-la-mob, then it
was D. F. made it all, and he was to be itoned for it He endeavoured to
confute all that was published by Webster, and Hodges, and the other writers
in Scotland against the Union: and he had Ms share of danger, since, as he
says, he was watched by the mob; had his chamber windows insulted,5 but, by
tie prudence of his friends, and God's providence he escaped. In the midst of
this great scene of business and tumult, he collected the documents, which he .after-
wards publiftked for the instruction of posterity, with regard to-one of-(he
most -difficult; and at the same time, the most fortunate transactions in our
annate.
 
X 2Q.
 
During all those labours awl risnues, De Foe published in December, 1706,
"'Caledonia, a Poem, in honour of the Scots Nation, This poetic ' essay which
''tyros intended to rescue Scotland from Slander in opinion, Caledonia" herself
'.bade him dedicate to the Duke of Qtieensberry. Beside other benefactions,
the Commissioner gave the author, whom he calls Daniel De Foe, Esquire,
an exclusive privilege to sell his encomiastic strains for seven years, within the
country of his celebration. Amidst our authoi's busy occupations at Edinburgh,
he <vas anxious  to assure the world, that wherever the writer may be, the
Reviews are written with his own hand; no person having, or ever had, any
concern in writing them, but the known author, P. F. On the Kith Ja-
nuary/the Act of'Union was passed by the Scots Parliament; and De Foe
returned to London, in February, 1706-7. While he thus acted importantly
at Edinburgh, he formed connections with considerable.-persons, who were
 proud of his future correspondence, and profiled from hi* political interests.
How otir author wits rewarded by the ministers who deriveu a benefit from
those services, and from that danger, as lie does not tell, cannot now be
known. Before Ins departure for" Scotland, indeed, Lord Godolphin as he
acknowledges, obtained for him the continuance of an appointment, which her
Majesty, by the interposition of km first benefuctor, had been pleased to make
him, in consideration of a former service, in u foreign country, wherein he
run1 as much risk as a grenadier on the counterscarp. "As he was too prudent
'to disclose his secret services, they must tit present remain undiscovered. Yet
is there reason to think that he hud a Pension rattier than an Office, since his
name is not in the red book of the Queen; and he solemnly avers, in his Appeal,
that he had not interest enough with Lord Oxford to procure him the arrears
. due to him in the time of the former Ministry. This appointment, whatever
it were, he is studious to-tell, he originally*owed to Harley: he, however,
'thankfully acknowledges, that Lord Godolphin continued his favour to him
after the unhappy breach that separated his first benefactor from the Minister,
who continued in power till August, 1710.
The nation, which'was filled with combustible matter, burst into flame the
moment of that memorable separation, in 1707. In the midst of this
conflagration our author was not inactive. He waited on Harley after he had
been driven from power, who generously advised him to continue his services
fo the Qneenf which he supposed would hare no relation to personal differences
ttmong* statesmen. Godolphin received him with equal kindness, by saying,-—
 I always think a man honest till I find to the contrary. And if we may credit
Be Foe's asseverations, in the presence of those who could have convicted hita
of falsehood,' he for three years held no correspondence with his principal bene-*
factor, which the great man never took ill of Mm,
,'; As earl? as February, 1706-7, De Foe avowed his purpose to publish the
History of the Union, which he had ably assisted to accomplish. This design
he executed in 1709, though he was engaged in other- lucubrations, 'and gave
the world a Review three times a week. His history seems to have been
little noticed when it first appeared 5 for, as the preface states, it had many
''''difficulties in the way; 'many factions to'encounter, and parties to please.
Yet'it waste-published in 1712; and a third time in 1?'86, when a similar'union
/ hid "become the topic of public debate and private conversation. The subject
"of this work is the completion of a measure which was carried into effect,
''''ftOtwithstatwlIttg obstruction* apparently insurmountable, and tumults ..ap-
-'froichlng to'rebellion, and which has produced the fends designed,. beyond
-ixpeetations whether we consider its'influence on 'the governments or-'it*

History is chiefly valuable as II transmits a faithful copj of die mmnm mi
sentim'ents of every age. This narrative of De Foe is a drama, in whichjie
introduces the highest peers and the lowest peasants, speaking and acting
according as they were each actuated by their characteristic passions; aad while
the man of taste is amused by his manner, the man of business may draw in-
struction from the documents, which are appended to the end, and interspersed
in every page. This publication had atone preserved his name, had his Crusoe
.pleased us km,
De Foe published in 170!), what indeed required less effort of the intellect
or the hand, The Jfhtory of Addresses; with no design, he says, and as we may
believe, to disturb the pub'lie peace, but to compare the present tempers of-
men with the past, iu order to discover who had altered for the better, and
who for the worse. He gave a second volume of Addresses in 1711,
with remarks serious and comical. His purpose plainly was to abate, liy
ridicule, the public fervour with regard to Sacheverel, who, by I know tiot
what fatality, or folly, gave rise to eventful changes. De Foe evinces, by these
tiinefnl publications, that amidst ail that enthusiasm and tumult, he preserved
his senses and adhered to his principles.
When by such imprudence as the world had never seen before, Godolphiu
was in his turn expelled, in August, 1710, our author waited on the ex-minis-
ter; who obligingly said to him, That he had the same good will, but not the
same power to assist Mm: and Godolphin told him, what was of more real use,.
—-to receive the Quern's commands from her confidential servants, when he mm
things settled. It naturally occurred to De Foe, that it was his duty to go
along with the ministers, while, as lie says, they did not break in on the Con-
stitution. And who can blame a very subordinate officer, (if indeed he held
an office), who had a wife and six children to maintain with very precarious
means? He was thus, says he, cast back providentially on his first benefactor,
who, laid his ease before Her Majesty, whereby he preserved his interest
without any engagement. On that memorable change, De Foe however
somewhat changed "his tone. The method I shall take, says he, in talking of
the public affairs, shall for the future be, though with the # same design to
support truth, yet with more caution of embroiling myself with a party, who
have no mercy and who have no sense of service,
De Foe sow lived at Newington, in comfortable circumstances, publishing
The Reviews, and sending out such tracts, as either gratified' his prejudices,
or supplied his needs.. During that contentious period he naturally gave and
received many wounds; and fie prudently entered into a truce with Mr: J.
Dyer, who was engaged in similar occupations, that, however they might
clash' in party, they "may write without personal reflections, and thus differ
still, and yet'preserve the christian and the gentleman. ^ But between professed
controvertistssueha treaty could only be perserved in with Punic faith. ^
While thus occupied, lie Foe was not forgotten by the City of Edinburgh,
with the usual ingratitude of public bodies. On the first of February, 1710-11,
that corporation, remembering his Caledonia, empowered him to publish the
Edinburgh tCourant, in the room of Adam Boogfe, though 1 suspect that-he
did not continue long to edify the Edinburgh citizens by his weekly lucubrations.
He had theft much to think of, and much to do at a distance: and, he soon
after gave some support to Lord Oxford's South-sea Project* by publishing
an Emm on the South-sea Trade, with an inquiry into the reasons of the
present complaint against the settlement of the- South-tea, Cottipany. _ In the
same year-he published an Essav at a plain Exposition of .that difficult fltflte
-*A, Gmd Peaee.- He obviously intended to abate the national ardour for ivtr,
and to incite a national desire of quiet. - .  , :.;

the hardest tasks' which can he assigned to British Statesmen—the re-e«»nsh-
ment of tranq^lity attar a glorious war. The treaty at Utrecht femisbes a
 
 
 
memorable example of this,' The furious debates which ensued within the
walls of Parliament and without, are sufficiently remembered. About this
time, says Buyer, in May, 17" 1 *3» a paper entitled Mereutor, or Commerce
Retrieved, was published on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This
was first fathered on Arthur Moore, agisted by Doctor D'Avenant; but the
latter solemnly denied it: and it soon after appeared to be the production of
Daniel De Foe, an ambidextrous hireling, who for this dirty work, received a
large weekly allowance from the treasury. That lie wrote in the Mercator
De Foe admits; but lie expressly denies "that lie either was the author of
it, had the property of it, the printing* of it, the profit of it, or had the power
to put anything-into it, if he would," And,, by his appeal he affirms before
God and the world, "that he never had any payment or rewaid for writing1
any part of it." Yet that he was ready to defend those papers of the Mercator
which were really his, if men would answer with arguments rather than abuse;
though not those things which he had never written, but for which lie had
received such usage. He add<«, with the noble spirit of a true born Englishman,
"The press was open to me as well as to others; and how, or when I lost
niy English liberty ofapeahia^ my mi ml, I hnow not: neither how my speaking*
my opinwns, without fee or reward, could authorise any one to call me villain,
rascal, traitor, and such opprobrious names."
Of the imputed connection with hU Ji-n't henl*faetor9 Harley, during that
memorable period, our author speaks with equal "firmness at a moment when
firmness was necessary. *'I solemnly protest," says he, by his sfppeal,"m the
presence of Him who shall judge us all, that 1 have received no instructions,
orders, or directions for writing- any tiling*, or materials from Lord Oxford, since
Lord Godolphin wasTi easurer, or taut 1 have ever shewn to Lord Oxford any thing
J had wi it ten or printed." J le challenges the world to prove the contrary; and he
affirms, that lie always capitulated for liberty to speak, according to bis own judg-
ment of things. As to consideration, pension or reward, lie declares most solemnly
that he had none, except his old appointment made him long before by Lord
Godolphin. What is extremely probable we may easily credit, without such
strong asseverations. However Lord Oxford may have been gratified by the
voluntary writings ofDe Foe, he had doubtless other persons who shared
his confidence, and wrote His Examiners.
But De Foe published that, which by no means promoted Lord Oxford's
views, and which, therefore, gained little of his favour. Our author wrote
against the peace of Utrecht, because lie approved of it as little us he had
done the treaty -of Gertruydenburgh, under very different influences, a few
years before. The peace he was for, as lie himself says, was such as should
neither have given the Spanish Monarchy to the House of Bourbon, nor to
the House of Austria; but that this bone of contention should have been
so broken to pieces, as that it should not have been dangerous to Europe;
and that England and Holland should have so strengthened themselves, by
sharing its commerce, as should have made them no more afraid of France
or the 'Emperor $ and that all that we should conquer in the Spanish West
Indies should be our own. But it is equally true, he affirms, that when the
peace was established, "I thought our business was to make the best of it;
and rather to inquire what improvements could be made of it, than to be con-
tinually exclaiming against those who procured it."
,, He manfully avowed his opinion in 1715, when it was both disgraceful and
dangerous, that the 9th article of the Treaty of Commerce was calculated for
the advantage of our trade; "Let who will make it, that," says he, "is no-
thing to me. My reasons are, because it tied up the French to open the door
to our manufactures, at a certain duty of importation there, and left the parlia-
ment ;of Britain at liberty to shut their* s out, by m high duties as they pleased
.here,, there being no limitation upon us as, to duties on French goods, but that
.other,nations should pay the same, tWhile the' French were thus bound, aod
 
 
the British free, I always thought we must lie in a condition to trade'to advan-
tage, or it must lift our own fault: this was i»y opinion, and is bo still; and f
would engage to maintain it against any man, on a public stage, before a jury
of lift? merchants, and venture my life upon the cause, if I were assured of fair
play in the dispute. But, that it was my opinion, we might carry oil a trade
with France to our great advantage, and that we ought for that reasou to trade
willi them, appears in the third, fourih, fifth, and sixth volumes of The Review,
above Bine years before The Mereator was thought of.*' Experience lias de-
cided in favour of l)e Foe against his opponents, with regard both to the theory
and the practice of commerce.
In May 1?13» our author relinquished the Review, after nine years* conti-
nuance: in Newgate it began, and in Newgate tt ended. Whether we consider
the frequency of the publication, or the power of his disquisitions, the pertina-
city of his opponents, or the address of his defences, amid other studies without
assistants, this must be allowed to be such a work, as few of our writers have
equalled. Yet, of this great performance, said <»ay; "The poor Review u
quite exhausted, and grown so very contemptible, that though he lias provoked
all Ms brothers of the quill, none will enter into a controversy with him. The
fellow, who had excellent natural parts, but wanted a small foundation of learn-
ing, is a lively instance of those wits, who, a* an ingenious author .says, will
endure but one skimming." Poor Clay bad learned this cant in the Scriblerus
Club, who thought themselves the wisest, the wittiest, and virtuousest men, that
ever were, or ever would be. But of all their works, which of them have been
so often skimmed, or yielded such cream, an Rof/nison Crusoe^ the Family In-
structor, or Religious Courtship F Some of their writings may indeed be allowed
to have uncommon merit; yet, let them not arrogate exclusive excellence, or
claim appropriate praise.
When l)e Foe relinquished the Review, lie began to write A Ceneral
History of Trade, which he proposed to publish in monthly numbers. _ Hie
first number appeared on the first of August 171*5. His great design was
to shew the reader, u IF hut the whole world is iff; this if an? tmployed in as
(0 trade," But his more iinme Hate end iros, to reef if a the misfofte we are
faUen into as to commerce, and to inform thof,c who are willing to inquire into
the truth. In the execution of this arduous undertaking, lie avows his intention
of speaking what reason dictates and fact justifies, however he may clash with
the popular opinions of some people in trade. He could not, however, wholly
abstract himself from the passing scene. When his second number appeared,
on the 15t!i of August; 1/13, he gave a discourse on the harbour of Dunkiik;
wherein lie insists/that the port ought to be destroyed, if* it must remain with
France; hut, if it were added to England, or made*a free port, it would be for
the good of mankind to have a safe barliour in such dangerous seas. This his-
tory of trade which exhibits the ingenuity, the strength, and the piety of Dc
Foe, extended only to two numbers. The agitations of the times carried film
to other literary pursuits; and the factiousness of the tiroes constrained him to
attend to personal security* "While I spoke of things thus," says our author*,
"1 bore infinite reproaches, as the defender of the peace, by pamphlets, which
I had no hand ift.,, He appears to have been silenced by noise, obloquy, and
insult, and (hiding himself in this manner treated, he declined writing at all, as
lie assures us; and for great part of a year never set pen to paper, except in the
The Reviews. u After this," continues he, "f was a long time absent in the
north of England** though we may easily infer, for a very different reason thin
that of the famous retirement of Swift, upon the final breach between Oxford
and Bolingbrokc.
The place of his retreat is now known to have been Halifax, or the borders of
Lancashire. And observing here, as tie himself relates, the insolence of the M-
f&h*m .party, and how they insinuated the Pretender's rights into the common
"people, *' I set pea to paper again, by writing A Seasonable Caution? and 'to

wrote three ©tier pamphlets; tie first, What if the Pretender should come?
the second. Reasons againjt&e succession if the House of Hanover; the third.
What jf,the Queen should die? "Nothing could be more plain," says he, " than
that the lilies of these were amusements, in order to'put the books into the
hands of those people, who have been deluded by the Jacobites." These petty
volumes were so much approved by the zealous friends of the Protestant suc-
cession, that they were diligent to disperse them through the most distant coun-
ties. . And De Foe protests, that had the Elector of Hanover given him a
thousand pounds, he could not have" served him more effectually, than by
writing these, three treatises.
The reader will learn with surprise and indignation, that for these writings
0.e Foe ^. was arrested, obliged to give -Eight Hundred pounds bail, contrary
toithe Bill,of Rights, and prosecuted by information during Trinity Term 171&
This groundless prosecution was instituted by the absurd zeal of William
Benson, who afterwards became ridiculously* famous for literary exploits,
which justly raised him to the honor* of the Dunciad. Our author attributes
this prosecution to the malice .of bis enemies, who were numerous and
powerful. No. inconsiderable people were heard to say, that they knew.the
books were against the Pretender, but that Be Foe had disobliged them in
other things, mul they resolved to tale this advantage to punish him. Tfain
story is the more credible, as he had procured evidence to prove the fact,
had the trial proceeded. He was prompted by consciousness of innocence
t& defend himself in the Review during the prosecution, which offended the
Judges, who, being somewhat infected with the violent spirit of the times,
committed him to Newgate in Easter Term 1713. He was however soon
released on making a proper submission. But it was happy for De Foe
that his first benefactor wag. still 'in power, who procured him the Queen's
pardon in November 1713. This act of liberal justice was produced by the
party-writers of those Much and bitter days, m an additional proof of Lord
Oxford's attachment to the Abdicated family, while De Foe was said to be
convicted of absolute Jacobiteism, contrary to the tenor of his life, and the
purpose of his writings. He himself saici sarcastically, that they might as
well have made him & Mahometan, On his tomb stone might have been en*
graved, that he was the only Englishman who had been obliged to ask a royal
pardon, for writing in favour of the Hanover succession.
*' By this time/' says Boyer, in October 1714, "the treasonable design to
bring in the Pretender was manifested to the world by the agent of one of the
lute managers, Be Foe, in his History of the White Steffi The detection of
the Secret History of ike White Staff, which was soon published confidently
tells that it was written by De Foe $ as is to be seen by his abundance of
words,, .his false thoughts, and kis false English." We now know that there
was .at that epoch, no plot in favour of the Pretender, except in the assertions
of those who wished to promote there interest by exhibiting their zeal Ami
'I'have,shewn that De Foe had clone*more to keep out the-Pretender, than
the political tribe,,who proited from his zeal, yet detracted from his fame*
"No sooner was the Queen dead," says he, "and the king as right required,
proclaimed, but the rage of men increased upon me, to that degree, thai
their threats were such as I am unable to express. Though I have written

Maecenas has his modern fancy strung,
And fixed his.pension first, or he had never sung.
While thus insulted by enemies, and discountenanced by power, De Foe
published his Appeal fa Hmwnr and Justice, in 1/16; being tt if tie amount
of Jits conduct in puhl'w affairs, Asa motive for this intrepid measure, he
affect iugly says, "That, by the hints of mortality and the infirmities of ft
life of sorrow' awl fatigue, I have reason to think, that 1 am very near to the
great ocean of eternity, and the time may not be long ere 1 embark on the
last voyage: wherefore, I think 1 should even acwwnts with this world before
1 go, tlrit no slanders may lie against my heirs, to disturb them in the peaceable
possession of their father's inheritance, his character." It is a circumstance
perhaps unexampled in the life of any other writer, that before he could
finish his appeal, he was struck with an apoplexy. After languishing more
than six weeks neither able to go on, nor likely to recover, bis friends thought
fit to deiay the publication no longer. ** It is the opinion of most, who know
him," says Baker, the publisher, ** that the treatment which he here complains
of, and others of which lie would have spoken, have been the cause of this
disaster. When the anient mind of J)e Foe reflected on what he had done,
and what he had suffered, how he bad been rewarded and persecuted, his heart
melted in despair. I lis spirit, like a candle struggling1 in the socket, biased
and sunk, and blazed and sunk till it disappeared in darkness.
While his strength remained he expostulated with his adversaries in the
following terms of gnat manliness, and instructive intelligence;—" It ha#
been'the disaster of all parties in this nation, to be very lint in their turn, and'
as often a* they have been so, f have differed with them all, and shall do so.'
I will repeat some of the occasions on the whig side, because from that
quarter the accusation of my turning about comes.
"The first fhm I had the* misfortune to differ with my friends, was about'
the year 10*83, when the Turks were besieging Vienna, and the Wtiigi la
Knirland, generally speaking, were for the Turks taking it, which J, having
read the history of the cruelty and perfidious dealings of the Turks in their
wars, and how they had rooted out the name of .the Christian religion in above
three score and ten kingdoms, could by no means agree with: and though
then but a young man, and a younger author, I opposed it, and wrote agaihtt
it, which was taken very unkindly indeed.
"The next time I differed with my friends wa? when King James'was
wheedling the Dissenters to take off the penal law?* and test, which 1 could by
no means come into, I told the Dissenters I had rather the Church of
England should pull our clothes off by inm and forfeitures, than the f aplsti
should fall both upon the Church ami the Dissenters, and pull our skins off
by Ire and faggot,
u The next difference, I had with good men, was about'the scandalous
practice of occasional conformity, in which I had the misfortune to make
tpany'honest men angry, rather because 1 had the better'of the argument*
than because they disliked what I said. ''':

Will the same independence of spirit, but with greater modesty of manner,
oar author openly disapproved of the intemperance,'which was adopted by go-
vernment in I?J4, contrary to. the original" purpose of George I.  '*' It is and
.ever ;was my opinion," says De Foe in his Appeal, " that moderation is the only
virtue by which the tranquillity of this nation can lie preserved; and even the
king himself, (I believe his majesty will allow me .that freedom,) can only be
happy in' the enjoyment of the crown,  Ify a moderate administration: it he
„ .should.be•obliged, contrary to his known disposition, to=join with intemperate
councils, if'it does not lessen his security, I am persuaded it will lessen hta'satis-
faction. To attain-at the happy calm, which is the consideration tha-t-ahoutd move
us all (and he would merit to be called the nation's physician who could prescribe

thority, he is to he censured: whether Addison defended the Septennial "Bill;
or the Peerage Bill, he is to he praised, With the same misconception'i>f 'the

The State Anatomy, in 17i/» The titrw* however will at last come, 'when'the
world will judge of men from their actions rather than pretension*. " "[
The death of Anne, and the accession of George I. seem to have, convinced
De Foe. of the vanity of party writing', And from this eventful epoch, he-ap*
pears to have studied- how to meliorate rather than to harden the heart 5 how to
regulate, more than to vitiate the practice of life. 
Early in 1715 lie published The Family Instructor, in three parts: 1st. re-
lating to fathers and children; 2nd. to masters and servants; 3d. to husbands
and wives.- He carefully concealed his authorship* lest the good effects of his
labour should he obstructed by the great imperfections of the writer, - The
world was then too busy to fook immediately into the work. The hook-
seller soon procured a recommendatory letter from the'Reverend Samuel
Wright, a well known preacher In the Black friars. It was praised from the
pulpit and the press; and the utility of the end, with the attractiveness of the
execution, - gave it, at length, a general reception. The author^ first design
was to write""a Dramatic Poem; but the subject was too solemn, and the-text
too copious, - to admit of restraint, or to allow excursions. His purpose was
to divert and instruct, at the same moment; and by giving it a dramatic form,
it has been called by some a religious play. De Poe at last says, with his usual
archness, as to its being called a play, lie it called so if they please; it must
be confessed some parts of it are too much acted in many families among' us.
The author wishes, that either all outplays were as useful for the improvement
 and entertainment of the world, or that they were less encouraged. There is,., 1
think, some mysticism in the preface, which it were to be desired, a judicious
hand would expunge, when The Family Instructor shall be again reprinted:
for, reprinted it will be, while our language endures; at least, while wise men
shall continue to consider the influences of religion and the practice Of mora1 h. as
of the greatest use to society. " - 
De Foe afterwards added a second volume, in two parts; 1st, relating to
Family Breaches; 2dly» to the great Mistake of mixing the Passions in the ma*
mging of Children. He considered it, indeed, as a Sold adventure to write a
second volume of any thing; there being a general opinion among modern rea-
ders,-that second parts never come up to the spirit of the first.  ffe quotes Mr.
Milton, for differing from the world upon the question, and for affirming with
regard -to his own great performances, That the people had a general sense 'hf
the lorn of paradise, Sui mot an equal gust for regaining it. Of 'De Fde^s
second volume, it will easily be allowed, that it is as'tnstructive and pleasing fes
the first, His Religious Courtship f+which he published In 1722, may prbperly
be considered-as a third volume. For the design is equally moral, tWmanneris
equally attractive, and it may in the same manner be caMe&b religious play. '<'
 'But'the time at length came, when De Foe was to deliver to-the1 world tile
most .popular of all his performances. In April 1719; he published the Wgli
known Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe* The reception" wis
immediate and universal; and Taylor, who purchased the manuscript after every
bookseller had refused it, is said to have gained a thousand pounds. -. If It be

Robinson Crusoe had scarcely drawn his canoe ashore, when lie was attacked
by'his oil! enemies, the images. He was assailed first by The Life and strange
Adventure** of Mr. />—•— De F—, of London, Hotter, 'teho has lived above
Fifty Years by himself in the Kingdoms of North' and South Britain. ^ Inn, d nil
dialogue between De foe, Crusoe, and his man Friday, our Author's life Is lam-
pooned, and his misfortunes ridiculed. But lie who had been struck by apo-
plexy,'and who was now discountenanced' by power, was no It object of an
Englishman's satire. Our author declares, when he was himself a writer of sa-
tiric-poetry,' that he never reproached any man for his private infirmities, for
having his house burnt; his ships cast away, or" his fitmily ruined; nor had he
ever lampooned any one, because he could not pay his debts, or differed in
judgment from him/' Pope has been justly censured for pursuing a vein of
satire extremely dissimilar. And Pope placed De Foe with Tutchin, in The
Duneiad, when our author's infirmities were greater and his comfort less. He
was ajrain assaulted in 1719, by An Epistle to D— De F—, the reputed
author of Robinson 'Crusoe. -"Mr. Foe,?? says the letter writer, "I have pe-
rused your pleasant story of Robinson Crusoe; and if the faults of it had- ex-
tended no further than the frequent solecisms and incorrectness of style, impro-
babilities, and sometimes impossibilities, I had not given you the trouble of this
epistle."' "Yet," said Johnson to Piozzi, " was there ever any thing written by
mere man,' that'was wished longer by its readers, except Don Quixote, Robin-
ion Crusoe, and the Pilgrim's Progress?" This epistolary critic, who renewed
his angry attack'when the second volume appeared, has all the dullness, without
the acumen, of Dennis, and all his malignity, without his purpose of reforma-
tion;" The Life of Crusoe has passed through innumerable editions, and has
been translated into foreign languages, while the criticism sunk into oblivion.
De Foe Bet the critics at defiance while he had the people on his side. As a
commercial legislator he knew, that it is rapid sale which is the great incentive:
and, in August 1719, he published a second volume of surprising adventures,
with similar success. In hope of profit and of praise, he produced in August
1720, Serious Reflections during the Life of Robinson Crusoe, with his vision of
the'Angelic World, He acknowledges that the present work is not merely the
product of the two first volumes, but the two first may ratner be called the pro-
duct of this: the fable is always made for the moral, not the moral for the fable.
He however 'did not advert, "that instruction must be insinuated rather than
enforced. That this third volume has more "morality than fable, is the cause
I« fear that it has never been read with the same avidity as the former two, or
spoken of with the same1 approbation. We ail prefer amusement to instruc-
tion i 'and he who would inculcate useful truths must study to amuse, or he will
offer hit lessons to an auditory, neither numerous, nor attentive,
. The .tongue of detraction is seldom at rest. It has often been repeated, that
De'Foe. had surreptitiously appropriated the papers of Alexander Selkirk, a
Scotch mariner, who having lived solitarily on the isle of Juan Fernandez, four
years and four months, was relieved on the 2nd. of February, 170&-9,' by
'Captain Woodes logers, in his Cruising Foyage round the frorld. But' let
no'one draw inferences'till the fact be first ascertained. The adventures of
Selkirk bud been thrown into the air, in 1712, for literarjr bawls 4o-devout;
and.'Delta* mm have catched a common prey, which 'he converted to
the uses of lis "intellect, and distributed for the purposes of his' interest.
Thus -lie-Way have "fairly acquired the'fundamental incident -of 'Crusoe's
life | ''but*W':did not borrow the various events, the useful; moralities,  or the
eftgaging style.'-^ Few'irien could twite 'inch a Poem j' and few' Selkirk**" could
l«italr»ptbetfe aft original. 'It w» the happiness of' De Foe, :tHa't" m mmmj
writers have succeeded in relating enterprises by land, he excelled in minuting
 
adventures-by sea, with such felicities of language, such attract!?^ varieties,
such  insinuative instruction, m lime- seldom*" been equalled .'but never
surpassed.
While De Foe in tliis manner busied himself in writing adveutures, which
have charmed every reader, a rhyming fit returned on him. He published in
1J20, Tim Complete Jrt qf* Pointing, irhkh he did into tinglhh (mm rhV
French of I)u Fresnoy. Dryden Had given, in Jb'!>5, a translation til Pit
Fre*nov*s Poem, which has fieen esteemed for its knowledge of the Sister
arts. What could tempt De Foe to this undertaking' it is not easy to discover,
unless we may suppose, that he hoped to gain a few guineas, without much
labour of the head or hand. Dryden has been justly praiaed for relinquishing 
vicious habits of coin position, and adopting better model* for his muse.
De Foe, after lie had seen the correctness, and heard the music of Pope,
remained unambitious of accurate rhymes, and regardless of sweeter numbers*
Hi* politics and his poetry, for which he was long' famous among biographers,
would not have preserved his name beyond the fleeting day; yet 1 suspect that,
in imitation of Milton, lie would have preferred his Jure Dirhm to hi*
Robinson Crusoe.
De Foe lived not then, however in pecuniary distress, for his genius and his
industry were to .Mm the mines of Potosi: and in 1J22, lie obtained from the
Corporation of Colchester, though my inquiries hare not discovered by what
interposition, a ninety-nine years lease of Kings wood Heath, at a yearly rent of
a hundred and twenty pounds with a fine of live hundred pounds. This
transaction seems to evince a degree of wealth much above want, though the
assignment of his lease not long after to Walter Bernard, equally proves,
that lie could not easily hold what he had thus obtained, Kingswo'od Heath
m now worth three-hundred pounds a year.
Whatever may have been his opulence, our author did not waste his sub-
sequent life in unprofitable idleness. No one can be idly employed who
endeavours to make his fellow-subjects better citizens and wiser-men.
This will sufficiently appear if we consider his future labours, under the distinct
heads of voyages; fictitious biography; moralities, either grave or ludicrous;
domestic travels: and tracts on trade.
The success of Crusoe induced De Foe to publish in 1/20, The Life and
Piracies of Captain Singleton, though not with similar success. .The plan
is narrower and the performance is less amusive. In 1725, he gave A New
Voyage round the World, hij a course never sailed before* Most,voyager's'
have had this misfortune, that whatever success they bad In the adventure,
they had very little in the narration: they are indeed full of the incidents' of
sailing, but they have nothing of story for the use of readers who never
intend to brave die dangers of the sea. These faults De Foe is studious "to
avoid in his new voyage* He spreads before his readers such ad ventures .as nc
writer of a real voyage can hope to imitate, if we except the teller of' Ansonfa
tale. In the Life of Crusoe we are gratified by continually imagining that
the fiction is a fact: in the voyage round the world, we are pleased by con-'
stantly perceiving that the fact'is a fiction, which, by uncommon skill, is
made more interesting than a genuine voyage*
Of fictitious«biography it is equally true, that by matchless art it maybe
made more instructive than a reaUlfe. Few of our writers have excelled De
foe In this kind of biographical narration, the great qualities of which are,
fo attract by the diversity of circumstances, and to instruct by the uscftilneas
of examples. , i .•.
He published in 1720, the History of Duncan Campbell. Of a person who
was born,. deaf, and. dumb, but who himself taught the deaf nod dumb to
understand,-It la easy to see that the life, would, be extraordinary. Jt will'be
Iwtnd thai the author. b»§ intermixed i©me disquisitions of learning* and lis*
 
qqntrived that the merriest passages shall end with some edifying moral The
fortunes and, Misfortunes officii Flanders, were made to gratify the world iti
1721. De Foe was aware that in relating a vicious life, it was necessary to make
the best use of a bad story, and lie artfully endeavours, that the reader shall
be more pleased with the moral than the fable, with the application than the
relation i with tlr end of the writer than the adventures of the person.
There was published in 17-21, a work of a similar tendency, the Life of
Colonel Jack, who was bora a gentleman, but was bred a pickpocket. Our
author is studious to convert his various adventures into a delightful^ field,
where the reader might gather herbs, wholesome and medicinal, without
the incommodation of plants, poisonous or noxious. In 1/24, appeared the
jii/e of Roxann* Scenes of crimes pan scarcely be ^represented in such a
manner, says Be Foe, hut some make a criminal use of them; but when vice
is painted in iti low prized colours it is not to make people love what from
the, .{rightfulness of theiifigures they ought necessarily to hate. Yet, I am
not convinced, that the world has been made much wiser, or better, by the
perusal of these live.*: they may have diverted the lower orders, but I doubt
if they have much improved them; if however they have not made them
better they have not .left them worse. But they do not^ exhibit many
scenes which are welcome to cultivated minds. Of a very different, quality
are the Memoirs of a (JamHer, during the Civil Wars in England, which
seem to have been published without a date. This is a romance the likest to
truth that ever was written* It is a narrative of great events, which is drawu
with such,simplicity, and enlivened with such reflections, as to kiform the
Ignorant and entertain the wise.
The moralities of De Foe, whether published in single volumes, or inter-
spersed through many passages, must at last give him a superiority over the
crowd of his contemporaries/ The approbation which has been long given to
his Famihj Instructor, and his Religious Courtship, ^seein to eon tain the
favourable decision of his country men. But there are still other performances
of this nature, which are now to be mentioned, of not inferior merit.
De Foe published, in 1722, A Journal of the Plague in 1(165. The author's
artifice consists in fixing the reader's attention by the deep distress of feliow-
inen; aod, bv recalling "the reader's recollection to striking examples of mor-
tality,, he endeavours 'to inculcate the uncertainty of life, and the usefulness of
reformation. In 1724, Dc Foe published, The Great Law of Subordination*
This is an admirable commentary on the unsufftrable behaviour of servants.
Yet though lie interest by his mode, inform by his foots, and convince by
his argument, he fails at last, by expecting from lavo what must proceed from
manners,- Our author gave the Political History of the Devil, m J 726. The
matter, and the mode conjoin to make this a charming performance. He engages
poetry and prose, reasoning and wit, persuasion and ridicule, on the side of re-
ligion and morals, with wonderful efficacy. De Foe wrote a system^ of magic in
l?26. This may be properly regarded as a supplement to the History of the
Devil,. His end and his execution are exactly the same. He could see no great
harm' in the present pretenders to magic, if the poor people would but keep their
tnoney in -their pockets, and that they should have their pockets ^picked by
8ucja an unperforming, unmeaning ignorant crew as.thesfe are, is the only
;»agic De Foe could see in the whole science. But the reader will discover
ift our author's system extensive erudition, salutary remark, and useful satire.
De Foe published in,, 1727, his Treatise on the Use mid'Abuse of the Marriage
9ed. The--author had begun.this performance thirty years before: lie delajei
ib# «uhli«fitiony though it had been long finished, in hopes, of reformation*
But being now vrown old and out of the reach of scandal, and, despairing of
amendment from a vicious, age, he thought proper.to. clmeMs days with this
satire. He appealed to .that judge* before. Whom he expecte<L*oon to appear,

endeavour to perform it in a manner, which was the least liable to reflection;
arid the rnbst answerable to the end of It—-the reformation of'the 'guilty.
After such an apnea!, "and ?noh asseverations, I will only remark, that tills'§•
an excellent hook with an improper title page. * ''.
We are now-to consider our author's fours. He published his Trnv&W
through l;ngland, in 1724 and 17*25; and through Scotland in 1727. He Foe'
was not one of those travellers who seldom quit the bunks of the Thttines.-
He had made wide excursion* over all those countries with observant'-everf
and a vigorous Intellect. Hie great artifice of these! volumes consists % the"
frequent mention of such men and things, as are always welcome to 'the
rentier5* mind.
Be Foe's Commercial Traets are to be reviewed bistlv. Whether his fancy
gradually failed, as age, hastily advanced, i am uttahled to tell. He certamly-
began, in 172£, to employ his pen more frequently on the real business
of common life, fie published in 17-7, The Cnmpfet' fCngthh Tradesman;
directing him in the several parts of trade. A second volume soon after
followed, which was addressed ehieily to the more experienced and more
opulent traders. In these treaitses the tradesmen found many direction* of
business and many lessons*of prudence. i)e Foe was not one of those writers,
who consider private vieesn* ptthtw henejits*. Goo forbid, he exclaims, that I
should be understood to prompt the vices of the age, in order to promote any
practice of traffic; trade need not bedestroyed though vice were mortally wountf*
ed. Willi this .salutary spirit he published, in J 7-*H» A Plan of the Engi'mh Com-
merce. This seems to be the conclusion of what he hud begun in 1713. In
1728, Gee printed his Trade and Navigation considered. l)e Foe insisted, that
our industry, our commerce, our opulence, and our people, had increased alii
were increasing. Gee represented that our manufactures had received mortal
stabs; that our poor won'4 destitute, and our country miserable, l)e Foe
maintained the truth which experience has taught to unwilling auditors. Gee
asserted the falsehood, without knowing the fact: yet Gee is quoted, while De
Foe, with all his kftowbdge of the subject, as a commercial writer, is almost
forgotten. The reason may be found perhaps in the characteristic remark with
which h» opens his plan. 'I'rade, like religion, is what every body talks of, but
few understand.
When curiosity lias contemplated such copiousness, such variety, and audi
excellence, it naturally inquires, which was the last of De Foe's performances?
Were we to determine from the elate of the title page, the Plan of Commefc$
must be admitted to be his last. But if we must judge from his prefatory
declaration in The Abxme of the Marriage Bed, where he talks of cloting km
days with thh natirc, which he was so far from seeing cause of being ashamed
of,' that he hoped lie should not be ashamed of it where tie wm going to account
for it, we must finally decide, that our author closed his career " with thh wfl*
right intention for the good of mankind.9* *
De Foe, after those'innumerable labours, which I have thus endeareured to
recal to the public recollection, died in April, 1/31, within the parish of Si.
Giles's, Cripplegate, London, at an age, if he were born in 1663, when it was
time to prepare lor hh last voyage. He left a widow, Susannah, who did'not

It is 'only said flat be was a wretched writer in the Flying Post, and the author
•of Alderman Barber's life, De Foe probably died insolvent; for tetters of ad-
ministration oa Ms goods and chattels were "granted to Mary Brooke, widow,
a credifcris:, in September 1738, after summoning in official form the next of
"-kin to appear. John Dunton, who personally knew our author,, describes him
in 1705, as a man of good parts ana clear sense; of a conversation ingenious
and brisk: of a spirit enterprising and bold/but of little prudence; with good
nature and real honesty. Of his petty habits little now can be told, more 'than
he lias thus confessed himself: Goo 1 .thank thee, !am not a drunkard, or a
swearer, or a whorcmaster, or a busy-body, or idle, or revengeful; and though
. this'be tree, and 1 challenge all the world to prove to the contrary, yet I must
own, I see small satisfaction in all the negatives of common virtues; for though
1 have not been guilty of any of these vices, nor of many more, I'have nothing
to infer from thence,*but Te Dmm laudamus. He says himself,
Confession will anticipate reproach;
He that reviles us then, reviles too much;
All Satire ceases when the men repent,
'Tis cruelty to lash the penitent.
When De Foe had arrived at sixty-five, while lie was encumbered with a fa-
mily, and, 1 fear, pinched with penury. Pope endeavoured, by repeated strokes,
to bring his grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. This he did without propriety,
and, m far as appears, without provocation; for our author is not in the black
list of'scribblers, who by attempting to lessen the poet's fame, incited the sa-
tirist's Indignation. The offence and the fate of Bentley'and De Foe were
nearly aliice. Bentley would not allow the translation to be Homer, De Foe
had endeavoured to bring Milton into vogue seven years ere the Paradise Loni
and Chevy Chase had been criticised in the Spectators by Addison. Our author
had said in M$re Reformation,
Let this describe the nation's character,
One man reads Milton, forty -——-.-——
The case is plain, the temper of the time,"
One wrote the lewd, the other the sit Mime.
An enraged poet alone could have thrust into the'Dunciad, Bentley, a pro-
found scholar, Cibber, a brilliant wit, and De Foe, a happy genius. Phis was
the consequence of exalting satire as the test of truth; while truth ought to
have been enthroned the test of satire. Yet,U ought not to be forgotten, that
De Foe lias 'some sarcasm in his System'of Magic, on the Sylphs and Gnomes,
which Pope may have deemed a daring invasion of his Rosicrutian territories. ^
De Foe has not yet outlived his century, though he has outlived most of his
contemporaries. Yet the time is come, when he must be acknowledged as one
of the ablest, as he is one of the most captivating writers, of which this island
:can boast. Before he can be admitted to this pre-eminence, he must be consi-
dered distinctly, as a poet, as a novelist, as a polemick, as a commercial writer,
mi w a grave historian. As a poet, we must look to the end of his effusions
rither than ,to his execution, ere we can allow him considerable praise. To
ftiolllfy national animosities, w to vindicate national rights, are certainty noble
"objects, which merit the vigour and the imagination of "Milton, or the flow and
precision of Pope; but our author's energy runs into harshness, and his «weet-
'ees« is ;to be tasted in his prose, in ore than iujhis poesy; if we regard the- adven-
'teres ofOtisoe, tike the adventures of Telemactais, as a poem, his moral, hi§
'.incident*; and hi\language, must lift him high on the pott's scale, , His pro-

more numerous edition*. And he wbo*e works have p)cu>cd generally and
pleased long* j must be deemed a writer of no ^mull estimation; the people's
verdict being the proper test of what they are the proper judges.
As a polemic, 1 fear we must regard our uuthor with less kindness, though it
must be recollected, that he lived during a contentious period, when two parlies
distracted the nation, and writers indulged in great asperities. Hut in opposition
to reproach, let it ever be remembered, that he defended freedom, without
anarchv; that lie supported toleration, without libertinism; that he pleaded for
moderation even amidst violence. With aeute.ncss of intellcrf, with keenness of
wit, with archness of diction, and pertinacity of design j it must ho allowed that
nature had qualified, in a high degree, I)e Foe, for a disputant. His polemical
treatises, whatever might have been their attractions once, may now be delivered
without reserve to lho.se who delight iu polemical reading, De Foe, it must be
allowed, wan a party-writer. Hut were not Swift and Prior, Sfeel and Addison,
Halifax and Bolingbroke party-writers? I)e Foe, being a party-writer upon
settled principles, did not change with the change of parties: Addison and Steel,
Prior and Swift, connected a* they were with persons, changed their note ass per-
sons were elevated or depressed.
As a commercial writer, De Foe is fairly entitled to stand in the foremost nmk
/imoug his contemporaries, whatever may he their performances or their fame.
Little would he his prai.se, to.say of him, that he wrote on commercial legislation
like Addison, who when he" touches on trade, sinks into hnbeciility, without
knowledge of fact, or power of argument. The distinguishing characteristics of
De Foe,'"as a commercial disquisitor are originality and depth. He has many
sentiments with regard to traffic which are scattered through hi* review*. And
which 1 never read in any other book. Hi* Owing Jims no dmriitj is a capital
performance, with the exception of one or two thoughts about the abridgement
of labour by machinery, which are either half formed or half expressed. , Were
we to compare De Foe with D'Avenant it would be found that fPAvaiatit ha*
more detail from official documents; that De Foe lias more fact from wider
inquiry. D'Avenant is more apt to consider laws in their particular applica-
tion; De Foe more frequently investigates commercial legislation in its general
effects. From the publications of D'Avenant it is sufficiently clear, that he
was not very regardful of means or very attentive to consequence*; Defoe
is more correct in his motives, and rnore salutary in his end*. But, lis a
commercial prophet, De Foe must yield the palm to Child; who foreseeing
from experience that men's conduct must finally lie directed by their principle*,
, foretold the colonial revolt: De Foe, flowing his prejudices^to obscure his
sagacity, reprobated that suggestion, because lie deemed interest a iiiore
strenuous prompter than enthusiasm. Were we however to form an opinion
cot from special passages, but from whole performances, we must incline to
DeFoe, when compared with the ablest contemporary: we must allow bitn
the preference, on recollection, that when he writes on commerce he seldom
fails to insinuate some axiom of morals,, or to inculcate some precept of
As an historian, It will be found, that our author had few equals in the English
language, when he wrote. His Memoirs of a Cavalier shew how wei he could
execute. the lighter narratives. His History of the Union effaces that he wa§
 
equal to the higher department of historic composition. This is an account
of a single event, difficult indeed in its execution, but beneficial certainly in
its consequences. With extraordinary skill and information, our author
relaxes, not only the event, but the transactions which preceded, and the effects
which followed, lie is at once learned and intelligent. Considering the
factiousness of the age, his candour is admirable. His moderation is exem-
plary. And if he spoke of James I. as a tyrant, he only exercised the prerogative,
which our historians formerly enjoyed, of casting obloquy on an unfortunate
race, in order to supply deficiency of knowledge, of elegance, and of style. In
this instance l)e Foe allowed his prejudice to overpower his philosophy. If the
language of his narrative wants the dignity of the great historians of the current
times, it has greater facility; if it be not'always grammatical, it is generally
precise; and if it be thought defective in strength, it must be allowed to excel
in sweetness.
Such then are the pretensions of De Foe to be acknowledged as one of the
ablest and most useful writers of our island.

That I would set tiiy HtV on any chance,
To mend St, or be rid orj't.
Whbk once sordid Interest seizes on the heart,

anil to taste—4kk it perverts, arid that it
annihilates. The time may conic, my friend,
when death shall dissolve the sinews of

her rights,
Such were the words of the Advocate Ne-
mours to Pierre dc la Motte, a» the latter
stept at midnight Into the carriage which was
to bear him far from Parts, from his creditors
and the persecution of the laws. I)e In Matte
thanked him for this last instance of his kind-
ness; the assistance lie had given him in

uttered a sad adieu! The gloom of the hour,
and the peculiar emergency of his circutiu
ilAnces, sunk him in silent reverie
Whoever has read Guyot de Pitaval, the
most faithful of those writers who record the
proceedings in the Parliamentary Courts of
Paris during the seventeenth century, must
surely remember the striking story of Pierre
de la Motte and the Marquess Philippe dc
Montalt: let all such, therefore, be informed,
that the person here introduced to their notice
was that individual Pierre de la Motte.
As Madame de la Motte leaned from the
coach window, and gave a last look to the
wall* of Paris—Paris, the scene of her former
happiness, and the residence of many dear
friends—the fortitude, which had till now
supported her, yielding to the force of grtef—
Farewell all! sighed she, this last look and
we are sepawtcct for ever! Tears followed
her wordi, and, sinking back, she resigned
herself to the stillness of sorrow. The recol-
lection of former times pressed heavily upon
her heart; a few months before and she was
surrounded by friends, fortune, and conse-
quen'ce; now she was deprived of all, a
miserable exile from be? native place, without
home, without comfort—almost without hope.
It was not the least of her afflictions that she
bad been obliged to quit Paris without bid-
ding adieu to her only son, who was now on
duty with his regiment in Germany; and
such liad been the precipitancy of this ie-
moval, that had she even known where be
was stationed, she had no time to inform hiw
of it, or of flit4 alteration in bis father*s cir-
cumstances.
Pierre do la Motte was n gentleman, de-
scended from an ancient bouse of France.
lie was a man whose passions often overcame
his reason, and, for a time, silenced bis con-
science; but though the image of virtue,
which nature had impressed upon lit? heart,
was sometimes obscured by the passing in-
fluence of vice, it was never wholly obliterated.
With strength of mind sufficient to bate
withstood temptation, he would have bcim a
good man; as it was, he was always a weak,
and sometimes a vicious iitt»wiiitT of society;
yet his mind was active, and bis imagination
Vivid, which co-operating with the force of
passion, often dazzled his judgment and sub-
dued principle. Thus he was a man, infirm
in purpose and visionary in virtue;—in a
word, his conduct was suggested by feeling,
rather than principle; and his virtue, such
as it was, could not stand the pressure of
occasion.
Early in life be had married Constance
Valentia, a beautiful and elegant woman,
attached to her family and beloved by them.
Her birth was equal, her fortune superior to
his; and their nuptials bad been celebrated
under the auspices of an approving and flat-
tering world. He* heart was devoted to La
Motte, and, for some time, she found In
Win an affectionate husband; but, allured
by the gaieties of Paris* he was soon devoted
to its luxuries, and in a few years bis fortune
and affection were equally lost in dissipation.
A false pride had still operated against his
interest, and withheld him from honourable
retreat while it wan yet in his power t the
habits which he bad acquired, enchained him
to the scene of his former pleasure; and thus
he had continued an expensive style of life till
the means of prolonging it were exhausted.
lie at length awoke from this lethargy of
security; but it was only to plunge into new
error, and to attempt schemes for the rep
ration of his fortune, which ^ served to tunk
him deeper in destruction. The consequent e
of a transaction, in which be thus engaged,
now drove him, with the strait wreck of hit
 
 
B
i
property, into dangerous and ignominious
It was his design to pass into one of the
southern provinces, and there seek, near the
borders of the kingdom, an asylum in some
obscure village., Wis family consisted of a
wife and two-faithful domestics, a man and
woman, who had followed the fortune of their
master.
The night was dark and tempestuous, and
at about the distance of three leagues from
Paris, Peter, who now acted as postillion,
having driven for some time over a mrild
heath where many ways crossed, stopped, and
acquainted Be la Motto with his perplexity.
The sudden stopping of the carriage roused
the latter from nis reverie, and filled the
whole party with the terror of pursuit; he
was unable to supply the necessary direction,
and the extreme darkness made it dangerous
to proceed without one. During this period
of distress, a light was perceived at some
distance, and after much doubt and hesitation,
La Motte, in the hope of obtaining assistance,,_
alighted and advanced towards it; he pro-'
eeeded slowly, from the fear of unknown pits.
The light issued from the window of a small;
and ancient house, which stood alone on the
heath, at the distance of half a mile.
Having reached the door, he stopped for
gome moments, listening in apprehensive
anxiety—no sound was heard hut that of the
wind, which swept in hollow gusts over the
waste. At length he ventured to knock, and
having waited for some time, during which
he,indistinctly heard several voices in conver-
sation, some one within inquired what he
wanted? Ia Motte answered, that he was a
traveller who had lost his, way, and desired to
be directed to the nearest town. That, said
the person, is seven miles off, and the road
bad'enough, even if you could see it ;• if you
only want a bed, you. may have it here, and
had better stay.
The " pitiless pelting" of the storm, which
at this' time beat with increasing fury upon
La Motte, inclined him to ^ give up the at-
tempt , of proceeding further till day-light;.
but, desirous of seeing the person with whom
he 'cofiVQrsecu before he ventured to expose his
family by calling up the, carriage, he asked
to, be admitted. The door was now opened
by a tall figure with a light, who invited La
Motte ,to enter, He 'followed the man through
a passage into a room almost unfurnished,
iii; one comer of which a bed was spread upon
the floor. The forlorn and desolate aspect of
this .apartment made' La Motte shrink invo-
luntarily, and he,was turning to go out when
the man suddenly pushed him, back,, and he
heard the' door locked upon him; his heart
failed, yci.he made a desperate, though vain,
effort to "force the door," and called loudly for
retaftse* .No answer was returned; but, he
distinguished the voices of men in the room
above, and, not doubting but their intention
was to rob and murder him, his agitation, at
first, overcame bis reason. By the light of
some almost-expiring embers, he perceived a
window, but the hope which this discovery
revived was quickly lost, when he found the
aperture guarded by strong iron bars. Such
preparation for security surprised him, and
confirmed his worst apprehensions. Alone,
unarmed—beyond the chance of assistance,
he saw himself in the power of people whose
trade was apparently rapine !—murder their
means !•—Atter revolving every possibility of
escape, he endeavoured to await the event
with fortitude; but La Motte could boast of
no such virtue.,
The voices had ceased, and all remained
still for a quarter of an hour, when, between
the pauses of the wind, he thought he dis-
tinguished the- sobs and moaning of a female;
he listened attentively, and became confirmed
in his conjecture; it was too evidently the
accent of distress. At this conviction the
remains of his courage forsook him, and a
terrible surmise darted, with the rapidity of
lightning, across his brain. It,was probable
that his carriage had been discovered by the
people of the louse, who, with a design of
plunder, had secured his servant, and brought
hither Madame Be la Motte* He was the
more inclined to believe this, by the stillness
which had for some time reigned in the house,
previous to the sounds, he now heard. Or it
was possible that the inhabitants were not
robbers, but persons to whom he had been
betrayed by his friend or servant, and who
were appointed to deliver him into the hands
of justice. Yet he hardly dared to doubt the
integrity of his friend, who had been intrusted
with the secret of his flight and the plan of
his route, and had procured him the carriage
in which he had escaped. Such depravity,
exclaimed La Motte, cannot surely exist in
human nature; much less in .the heart of
Nemours I
This ejaculation was interrupted by a noise
in the passage leading to the room: it ap-
proached—the door was unlocked—and the
man who had admitted La Motte into the
house entered, leading, or rather forcibly
dragging along, a beautiful girl, who appeared
to be about eighteen. Her features were
bathed in tears, and she seemed to suffer the
utmost distress, 'the man fastened' the lock
and put the key in his pocket He then
advanced to La Motte, who had before ob-
served other persons in. the, passage, and
pointing a pistol to his breast, You 'are
wholly . in out power, said he, no assistance
can reach you; if you wish to save your life,
swear that you will convey this girl where 1
may never see her more 5 or rathe? consent to
take her with you,' for your oath 1 would not
 
 
 
 
 
 
believe, and 1 can take care yon shall not find'
me ugain.^—Answer quickly, you have no
time to lose.
He now seized the trembling hand of the
girl,, who shrunk agliastt with terror, and
hurried her towards La Motte, whom surprise
still kept, silent. She sunk at his feet, and
with supplicating eyes, that streamed with
tears, implored him to have pity on her.
Notwithstanding' his present agitation, lie
found it impossible to contemplate the beauty
and distress of -the object before him with
indifference. Her youth, her apparent in-
nocence—the artless energy of her manner
forcibly, assailed' his, heart, 'and he was going
to speak, when the ruffian, who mistook the'
silence of astonishment for that of hesitation,
prevented1 him, 1 have a horse ready to take
you from hence, said lie, aud I will direct
you over the heath. If you return within an
hour, yon die :' after then, you are at liberty
to come here when you please.
La Motte,. without answering, raised the
lovely girl from the floor, and was so much
relieved from his own apprehensions, that he
had leisure to attempt dissipating hers.' Let
us be gone, said the ruffian, and have no
more of this nonsense; you may think your-
self well off it's no worse. 1*11 go and get
the horse ready.
The last words roused La Mottc, and per-
plexed him with new fears; he dreaded io
discover his carriage, lest its appearance
might tempt the banditti to plunder; and to
depart on horseback with this man might
produce a consequence yet more to be dreaded.
Madame la Motte, wearied with apprehen-
sion, would, probably, send for her husband
to the house, when all the former danger
would be incurred, with the additional evil
of being separated from his family, and the
chance of being, detected by the emissaries of
justice in endeavouring to recover them. As
these reflections passed over his mind In
tumultuous rapidity, a noise was again heard
in the passage, an uproar and scuffle ensued,
and in the same moment he could distinguish
the voice of his servant, who had been Kent
by Madame La Mottc in search of him.'
Being now determined to disclose what could,
not long be concealed, he exclaimed aloud,
that a horse was unnecessary, that he had a
carriage at some distance, which would con-
vey them from the heath, the man who was
seized being his servant.
The ruffian, speaking through the door,
bade him be patient a while and he should
hear mote from him. I^a Motte now turned
his eyes upon his unfortunate companion,* -
who, pale and exhausted, leaned for support
against the wall. Her features, which were
delicately beautiful, had gained from distress
an expression of captivating sweetness: she
had

sleeves, showed, but did not adorn, Jiet figure:

part of her haft had fallen in'disdrtler,' while

moment of further observation bef|*htHetl
the surprise of La Motte, 'and interested liim
more warmly in her favour. Such'clegAiice'
and apparent refinement, contrasted'1 with* the
desolation of the house, arid the savage'man*
ncrs of its inhabitants, seemed' to' hirit'lilce
a romance of imagination, rather than an
occurrence o( real life. He endeavoured to
comfort her, and his sense of €onipassleii%»3
too sincere to be misunderstood, ffer; ttfcor
gradually subsided into gratitude' nrrf gHcf.
Ah, Sir, said she, Heaven has sentjrbfe til
my,relief, and will aurely reward YotSf'foVyour'
protection: I have no friend irV the "world, if
I do not find am in yon, '. 
La Motte assured her of hiii'" Mttdhess,
when he was interrupted by the entrance of
the ruffian. He desired to be conducted to
his family. All in good time, replied the
latter; 1 have taken care of one' of them*
and will of you, please  St. Peter; so be
comforted. These comfortable words renewed
the terror of La Motte, who now earnestly
begged to know if his family were safe. O!'
as tor that matter they are safe enough,1 and'
you will be with them presently; but'don't'
stand jmrlgiriff here nil night. l)o you choose'
to go or stay? you know the condition's.
They now bound the eyes of La Motto' and'
of the young lady, whom terror had hitherto
kept silent, and then placing them on two-'
horses, a man mounted behind each," and
they immediately galloped oft'., They 'had
proceeded in this wr.y near half ari "hop?,,
when Ln Motte entreated to know whither "he"
was going? You will know that by'and by,
said the ruffian, so be nt peace,' Finding
interrogatories useless, La 'Motte''resthnect
silence till the horses'stopped. His conductor
then hallooed, and being answered By voice*
at some distance, in a few moments the" sotitid'
of carriage wheels was heard, and, ptesentty
after, the words of a man directing Peter
which way to drive, As the carriage ap-
proached, La Motte called, and, to*his Inex-
pressible joy, was answered by'his wife.
You are now beyond the borders of' the
heath, and may go which way you, will, said
the ruffian; M" you return within my hdur,'
you will be welcomed by a brace of-jfatflety*
This' was a very unnecessary caution'' tp I'd
Mottc, whom they now released. The' ydtsftg
stranger sighed deeply, as the erttdred 'tji'e
carriage; and the ruffian, having bestowed
upon Peter some directions iud more tfireats,

wait long.
La Motte immediately gave a short rela-
tion of what passed at the house, including
an account of the manner in which the young
stranger had been introduced to him. During
this narrative, her deep convulsive sighs fre-
quently drew the attention of Madame La
Motte, whose compassion became gradually
Interested in her behalf, and who now en-
deavoured to tranquilue her spirits. The
unhappy girl answered her kindness in artless
and simple expressions, ami then relapsed
into tears and silence, Madame forbore for
the present to ask any questions that might
lead to a discovery of her connexions, or seem
to require an eypknation of the late adven-
ture, which now furnishing her with a new
subject of reflection, the sense of her own
misfortunes pressed less heavily upon her
mind, The distress of La Motte was even
for a while suspended; he ruminated on the
late scene, and it appeared like a vision, or
one of those improbable fictions that some-
times are exhibited in a romance: he could
reduce it to no principles of probability, nor
render it comprehensible by any endeavour to
analyze it. The present charge, and the
chance of future trouble brought upon him
by this adventure, occasioned some dissatis-
faction; but ihe beauty and seeming inno-
cence of Adeline united with the pleadings of
humanity in her favour, and he determined to
protect her.
The tumult of emotions which had passed
n the bosom of Adeline began now to sub-
side; terror was softened into anxiety, and
*U -q> lit into grief. The sympathy so evident
in the manners of her companions, particu-
larly in those of Madame La Motte, soothed
her heart, and encouraged her to hope for
better days,
Dismally and silently the night passed on,
for the minds of the travellers were too much
occupied by their ..several sufferings to admit
of conversation.
The dawn, so anxiously watched for. at
length appeared, and introduced the strangers
more fully to each other. Adeline derived
comfort, from the looks of Madame La Motte,
who gazed frequently and attentively at her,
and thought she had seldom seen a counten-
ance so interesting, or. a form so striking.
The languor of sorrow threw a melancholy
grace upon her features, that appealed imme-
diately to the heart; and there was a pene-
trating sweetness in her blue eyes, which
indicated an intelligent and amiable mind,
La Motte now looked anxiously from the
coach window, that he might judge, of their
situation, and observe whether he was fol-
lowed. The obscurity of the dawn confined
his views, but no person appeared. The sun
at length tinted the eastern clouds and the
tops of the highest hills, and soon after burst
in full splendour on the scene, The terrors
of I/a Motte began to subside, and the griefs
of Adeline to soften, They entered upon a
lane confined by high banks and overarched
by trees, on whose branches appeared the first
green buds of spring glittering with dews.
The fresh breeze of the morning animated the
spirits of Adeline, whose mind was delicately
b« r. si hie to the beauties of nature. As she
 
viewed the flowery luxuriance of the turf, ami
the tender green of the trees, or caught, be.
tween the opening banks, a glimpse of the
varied landscape, rich with wood, anil failing
into blue find distant mountain**, her heart
expanded in momentary joy. With Adeline
i he charms of external nature were heightened
by those of novelty; she had seldom seen the
grandeur of an extensive prospect, or the mag-
nificence of a wide horizon—and not often the
picturesque beauties of more confined scenery.
Her mind had not lost by long oppression
that elastic energy, which resists calamity;
else, however, susceptible might have been
her original taste, the beauties of nature would
no longer have charmed her thus easily even
to temporary repose.
The road, at length, wound down the title
of a hill, and La Motte, again looking anxi-
ously from the window;, saw before bim an
open champaign country f through which the
road,  wholly unsheltered from observation,
extended almost in a direct line. The clanger
of these circumstances alarmed him, for his
flight might, without difficulty, be traced fm
many leagues from the hills he was now de-
scending. Of the first peasant that passed,
he inquired for a road among the hills, but
heard of none. La Motte now sunk into his
former terrors. Madame, notwithstanding
her own apprehensions, endeavoured to re-
assure him; but finding her efforts ineffec-
tual, site also retired to the contemplation of
her misfortunes. Often, as they went on, did
lm Motte look back upon the country they
had passed, and often did imagination suggest
to him the sounds of distant pursuit.
The travellers stopped to breakfast in a
village, where the road was at length obscured
by woods, and La Motte's spirits again re-
vived. Adeline appeared more tranquil than
she had yet been, and La Motte now ashed for
an explanation of the scene he had witnessed
on the preceding night. The inquiry renewed
all her distress, and with tears she entreated
for the present to be spared on the subject.
La Motte pressed it no farther, but he observed
that for the greater part of the day she seemed
to remember it in melancholy and dejection.
TJiey now travelled among the hills, and were,
fl wci'orc, in less danger of observation; but
l^Motte avoided the great towns, and stopped
it. obscure ones no longer than to refresh the
horses. About two hours afternoon, the road
wound into a deep valley, watered by aTiviikt
and overhung with wood. La Motte called
to Peter, and ordered him to drive to a thickly
embowered spot, that appeared on the left.
Here lie alighted with his family • and Peter
having spread the provisions on the turf, they
seated themselves and partook of a repast,
which, in other circumstances, would have
been thought delicious. Adeline endeavoured
to smile, but the languor of grief was now
heightened by indisposition* The.-violent
agitation of mind and fatigue of body-wliich
«he had suffered for the last'twenty-four hows,
bad ovcrpowed her strength,. and wl^n,!*
Motte lea her back to the carriage, her tfrbele
frame trembled with illness. But she tttUpgd
no complaint, and, having long obseWftf ;ihc
dejection of her companions, she wade a.feblc
effort to enliven them. 
They continued to travel throughout, the
day without any accident or interruption* and
about three hours after sunset arrived at Afpxi-
ville, a small town where 1j& Monte deter.
mined to pass the night. Bcpofe was, indeed,
necessary to the whole party, whoso pale and
haggard loolcs, as they alighted frota the car-
riage, were but too obvious to pass unobserved
by the people of the inn. As soon as jbods
could be prepared, Adeline withdrew.tocher
chamber, accompanied by Madame La Motto,
whose concern tor the fair, stranger made her
exert every effort to soothe and console.her.
Adeline wept in silence, and takirig-the hand
of Madame, pressed it to her bosom, . These
were not merely tears of grief— they wereiain*
gled with those wbicli flow (mm the grateful
heart, when, unexpectedly, it meets with sym-
pathy. Madame La Motte understood them.
After some momentary silence, she renewed
her assurances of kindness, and entreated
Adeline to confide in her friendship; but she
carefully avoided any mention of the subject
which had before so much affected 'her.
Adeline at length found words to express her
sense of this goodness, which she did in a
manner so natural and sincere, that Madame,
finding herself much affected, took leave of
her for the night*
In the morning, La Motte1 rose at an early
hour, impatient to be gone. -Every thing. ««
prepared for bis departure, and the breakfast
had been waiting some time, but Adeline did
not appear. 'Madame La Motte went to  her
chamber, and found her sunk in a disturbed
slumber. Her breathing was short and irre-
gular—she frequently started, or sighed, unci
sometimes she muttered an incoherent sen*
tfsnec. While Madame gazed with' concern
upon her languid countenance, she awoke,
and, looking up, gave he? hand to Madame
La Motte, who found it burning- with' fever*
She had paestd a restless night, and* as *he
now attempted to rise, he? brad, which, beat
with intense pain, grew giddy, her strength
failed, and she' sunk back*
Madame was much alarmed, being afconce
convinced that it was impossible she'could
travel, and that a delay might prove fatal.-to
her husband. She went to inform him of the
truth, and his distress may be more-easily im-
agined than described. He saw all the incon-
venience and danger of delay, ytl he could not
so far divert himself of humanity as to aban«
don Adeline to the cate, 01 rather to the neglect,
 
B3
 
of strange;*. , He tent immediately for a phy-
sloi,fti%-wW pronounced her to be in a high
fever* and .said a removal in her present state
mtfsibe fetal. La Motto now determined to
wail!the event, and endeavour to calm, the
trsm*jx>rts  of' terror which &%, times, assailed
him».,-fta ,the mean while he took such pre-
cautions 'as hi*; situation admitted of, passing
the greater part of the day out of the village,
in a'sppt;(mm.whence he had a view-of the
roadfof some distance,! yet, to he exposed to
defttrfutioBby-the illness of a girl whom he.
did-not know, and who had, actually been
fofted upon Win, was a .misfortune to which
lia Motte'bad not philosophy enough to sub-
mit with composure. ,
Adeline's fever continued to increase during
the whole day, and at night, when the physi-
cian-took his leave, he told La Motte the
event would<very  soon be decided. La. Motte
received this intelligence with real concern.
The beauty and innocence ^ Adeline had
overcome, the disadvantageous circumstances
under which she had been introduced to him,
and" he now gave less consideration to the in-
convenience she might hereafter occasion him,
than to the hope of" her recovery.
;,Madame La Motte watched over her with
tender anxiety, and observed with admiration
her-patient sweetness and mild resignation.
Adeline amply repaid her, though she thought
she'could not—Young as I am, she would
my, and deserted by those upon whom I have
a claim for protection, 1 can remember no con-
nexion to make me regret life so much, as that
t< hoped to form with you. If l live, my
conduct will best express my sense of your
goodness;—.words are but feeble testimonies,
; The sweetness of her manners so much at-
tested Madame La Motte, that she watched
the crisis of'her disorder with a solicitude
which precluded every other interest. Ade-
line passed a very disturbed night, and, when
the' physicion appeared in the morning, he
gave orders -that she should be indulged with
whatever she liked, and answered the inquiries
of La Motte with a frankness that left him
nothing to hopef
;. In the mean time, his patient, after drinking
profusely of some mild liquids, fell asleep, in
which ihe continued for several hours, and so
profound was her repose, that her breatli alone
gs»ve sign of existence. She awoke free from
fever, «nd with no other disorder than weak-
ness, which in a few days she overcame so well
as to be -able to set out with La Motte for
B**—,-a village out of the great road, which
.he thought it prudent to quit,. There they
passed the following night, and early the next
'morning commenced their journey upon a wild
.and- woody tract of country, they stopped
.About noon at * ..solitary, village, where they
took refreshments, and obtained directions for
passing the vast forest of Fontanvilk, upon
the borders of winch they now were. La
Motte wished at first to take a guide, but he
apprehended more evil from the discovery he
might make of his route, than he hoped for
benefit from assistance in the wilds of this un-
cultivated tract
La Motte now designed to pass on to Lyon*,
where he could either seek concealment in its
neighbourhood, or embark on the Rhone for
Geneva, should the emergency of his circum-
stances hereafter requite him to leave France.
It was about twelve o*clock at noon, and he
was desirous to hasten forward, that he might
pass the forest of Fontanville, and reach the
town on its opposite borders, before night-fall.
Having deposited a fresh stock of provisions in
the carriage, and received such directions as
were necessary concerning the roads, they again
set forward, and in a short time entered upon
the forest. • It was now the latter end of April,
and the weather was remarkably temperate
and fine. The balmy freshness of the air,
which breathed the first pure essence of vege-
tation; and the gentle warmth of the sun,
whose beams vivified every hue of nature, and
opened every floweret of spring, revived Ade-
line and inspired her with life and health.
As she inhaled the breeze, her strength seemed
to return, and as her eyes wandered through
the romantic glades that opened into the forest,
her heart was gladdened with complacent de-
light: but when from these objects she turned
her regard upon Monsieur and Madame La
Motte, to whose tender attentions she owed
her life, ami in whose looks she now read en-
teem and kindness, her bosom glowed with
sweet affections, and she experienced a force
of gratitude which might be called sublime.
For the remainder of the day they continued
to travel, without seeing a hut or meeting a
human being. It was now near sunset, and
the prospect being closed on all sides by the
forest, La Motte began to have apprehensions
that his servant had mistaken the way. The
road, if a road it could be called, which af-
forded only a slight track upon the grass, was
sometimes over-run by luxuriant vegetation,
and sometimes obscured by the deep shades,
and Peter at length stopped uncertain of the
way. La Motte, who dreaded being benighted
in a scene so wild and solitary as this forest,
and whose apprehensions of banditti were very
sanguine, ordered him to proceed at any rate,
and, if he found no track, to endeavour to gain
a more open part of the forest. With these
orders Peter again set forwards; but having
proceeded sonic way, and his views being still
confined by woody glides and forest walks, he
began to despair of extricating himself, and
t stopped for further orders. The sun was, now
'set; but as La Motte looked anxiously from
the window, he observed -upon the vivid glow
of the western horizon some dark toweis'rising
from among the trees at a little' distance, and

The carriage drove along initio* the shade
of " melancholy boughs," through which the
evening twilight, which yet coloured the air,
cliff used a solemnity that vibrated in thrilling
sensations upon the hearts of the travellers*
Expectation kept them silent* The present
scene recalled to Adeline a remembrance of
the late terrific circumstances, and Iter mind
responded hut too easily to the apprehension
of new misfortunes. La Motte slighted at
the foot of a green knoll, where the trees again
opening to light, permitted a nearer though
imperfect view of the edifice.

Hi: approached, ami perceived the Gothic re*
mains of an abbey: it stood on a kind of rude
lawn, overshadowed by high and .spreading
trees which seemed coeval with the building,
and diffused a romantic gloom around. The
greater part of the pile appeared to be sinking
into ruins, and that which had withstood the
ravages of time, showed the remaining fea-
tures of the fabric more awful in decay. The
lofty battlements, thickly en wreathed with ivy,
were half demolished, and become the resi-
lience of birds of prey. Huge fragments of
the eastern tower, which was almost demo,
lished, lay scattered amid the high grass, that
waved slowly to the breeze. 4I The thistle
shook its lonely head; the. moss whistled to
the wind." A Gothic gale, richly orna-
mented with fret-work, which opened into the
main body of the edifice, hut which was now
obstructed with brush-wood, remained entire.
Above the vast and magnificent portal of this
gate arose a window of the same order, whose
pointed arches still exhibited fragments of
stained glass, once the pride of monkish de-
votion. La Motte, thinking it possible it
might yet shelter some human being, ad-
vanced io the gate and lifted a massy knocker.
The hollow sounds rung through the empti-
ness of the place. After waiting a few mi-
nutes, he forced back the gate, which was
heavy with iron work and creaked harshly on
its hinges.
He entered what appeared to have been the
chapel of the abbey, wticre the hymn of devo-
tion had once been raised, uml the tear of
penitence had once been shed; sounds, which
could now only be recalled by imagination^—
tears of penitence, which had been long since
fixed in fate. La Motte paused a moment,
for he felt a sensation of sublimity rising Into
terror—-a su*i>cnskM of mingled astonishment
anil awe! He surveyed the vjwtnette of the"
place, and as he contemplated its ruins, fahey
bore him bark to past apes.*—Arid these walls,
said he, where once superstition lurked, and
austerity anticipated an' earthly *nr&)itorvY

The deepening' glooro now reminded I**
Motte that he had no tinie'to' losw; hut ihirio*
sky prompted him to explore further, -and he
obeyed the impulse* An he walked wet the
broken pavement, the sound of bin step* ran iff
echoes through the place, and seemeif lik«»thf>
mysterious accents of the dead reproving ibo"
sacrilegious mortal who thus daren to disturb
their precincts.
From this chapel he passed into Che nave of
the great church, of which one window, wore
perfect than the rest, opened upon a long vistu
of the forest, through which was seen the rich
colouring of evening, melting by fmpt*rorpti»
hie gradations into the solemn gray of upper
air. Dark hills, whose outline appeared ins-
tinct upon the vivid glow of the horizon,
closed the perspective. Several of the pillar*,
which hail once supported the roof, remained
the proud effigies of sinking greatness, and
seemed to nod at every murmur of the blast
over the fragments of those that had fallen a
little before them* La Motte sighed. The
comparison between himself and the gradation
of decay which these columns exhibited, wan
but too obvious artel affecting. A ft-w year«t
said he, and 1 shall become like the mortal*
on whose rclicks I now gate, and, like them
too, 1 way he the subject of meditation to- ft
succeeding generation, which shall totter but
a little while over the object they contemplate
er# they also sink into the dust.
Kctiring front the scene, he walked through
the cloisters, till a door, which rommunicateo1
with the lofty part of the building, aftractrf
his curiosity, fie opened this, and perceived
across the foot of the staircase another door;
—but now, partly checked by fear,'and partly
by the recollection of the surprise his ntmlltr
might feel In bis absence, he returned witn

Auft situation L» Motte and Peter endeayoured
to awe the carriage. The extent of this mis-
fortune  was adw dif€»Y«?ed, for they perceived
that the wheel wait  bmkA Their iiitresg was
reasonably- great* for not only was the coach
disabled" from proceeding, hut it could not
even afford a shelter from the-cold dew* of the
night, it being impossible to preserve It in an
upright situation. After a few moments*
silence, La Motte proposed that they should
return to the rains which they had just quitted,
which lay at a very short distance, and pass
the night in the most habitable part of them;
that, when morning dawned, Peter should
take one of the coach horses, and endeavour to
find a road and a town, from whence assistance
could be procured for repairing the carriage*
This proposal was opposed by Madame La
Motte, who ihudderecf at the idea of passing
so many hours of darkness in a place so forlorn
as the monastery. Terrors, which she neither
endeavoured to examine or combat, over c&mt
her, and she told La Motte she had rather re-
main exposed to the unwholesome dews of
night, than encounter the desolation of the
mills* La Motte had at first felt an equal
reluctance to return to this spot; but having
subdued his own feelings, he resol?ed not to
yield to those of his wife.
The horses being now disengaged from the
carriage^ the party moved towards the edifice.
As they .proceeded, Peter, who followed them,
struck a light, and they entered the ruins by
the flame of sticks which he had collected.
The partial gleams thrown across the fabric
seemed to make 'Its desolation more solemn,
while the obscurity of the greater part of the
pile heightened its sublimity, and Jed fancy on
to scenes of horror. Adeline, who had hitherto
remained in silence, now uttered an exclama-
tion of mingled admiration and fear. A kind
of pleaskg dread thrilled her bosom, and filled
aE her soul. Tears started into her eyes:_
she wished yet feared to go on ;~~«he hung
upon the arm of La Motte, and looked at him
with-«- sort of hesitating interrogation.
He opened the door of the great hall, and
they entered j its extent was lost in gloom,—
Let us stay here, said Madame de La Motte,
1 #111 go no farther. La Motte pointed to the
broken roof, and was proceeding, when he was
interrupted by an uncommon noise, which
passed along the hall. They were all silent—
it'Was the silence of'terror. Madame La
Motte spoke first. Let us quit this spot, said
she, any evil is preferable to the feeling which
now- oppresses me.-. Let us retire instantly.
The stillness had for some time remained un-
disturbed, and La Motte, ashamed of the fear
he had involuntarily betrayed, now thought It
necessary to affect a boldness which he did not
feel. Me therefore - opposed ridicule to the
terror of Madame, and indited 'Upon proceed-
ing. Thus compeEed to acquiesce, she tra-
versed the hall with trembling steps. They
came to a narrow passage* and Peter's sticks
being nearly exhausted, they awaited" here,
while he went in search of more.
The almost expiring light flashed faintly
upon the walls of the passage, showing the
recess more horrible. Across the hall, the
greater part of which was concealed in shadow,
the feeble ray spread a tremulous gleam, ex-
hibiting the chasm in the roof, while many
nameless objects were seen imperfectly through
the dusk. Adeline with a smile inquired of
La Motte if he believed in spirits* The ques-
tion was ill-timed; for the present scene im-
pressed its terrors upon La Motte, and, in
spite of endeavour, he felt a superstitious
dread stealing upon him. He was now, per-
haps, standing over the ashes of the dead. If
spirits were ever permitted to revisit the earth,
this seemed the hour and the place most suit-
able for their appearance. La Motte remain-
ing silent, Adeline said, Were 1 inclined to
superstition—she was interrupted by a return
of the noise which had been lately heard. It
sounded down the passage, at whose entrance
they stood, and sunk gradually away. Every
heart palpitated, and they remained listening
in silence. A new subject of apprehension
seized La Motte:—.the noiee might proceed
from banditti, and he hesitated whether it would
be safe to proceed. Peter now came with the
light: Madame refused to enter the passage
—La Motte was not much inclined to it; but
Peter, in whom curiosity was more prevalent
than fear, readily offered his services. La
Motte, after some hesitation, suffered him to
go, while he awaited at the entrance the result
of the inquiry. The extent of the passage
soon concealed Peter from view, and the
echoes of his footsteps were lost in a sound
which rushed along die avenue, and became
fainter and fainter till it sunk into silence.
La Motte now called aloud to Peter, but no
answer was returned; at length, they heard
the sound of a distant footstep, and Peter soon
after appeared, breathless, and pale with fear.
When he came within hearing of La Motte,
he called out, An please your honour, I*ve
done for them, 1 believe, but I've had a hart
bout* 1 thought 1 was righting with the
devil—What are you speaking of? said La
Motte.
They were nothing but owls and rooks
after all, continued Peter; but the light
brought them all about my ears, and they
made such a confounded clapping with their
wings, that 1 thought at first t had been betel

The latter part «# the sentence, intimating
a suspicion of his courage, I a Monti, could
hme dispensed with, and to retrieve in some
degree bis reputation* he made a point of pro-
ceeding through the passage* They now
nwvod on with alacrity, for, aa Peter said,
they luad nothing to fcar»
The passage led Into a large area, on one
aide of which, met a range of cloisters, ap-
peared the west tower, and a lofty part of trie
edifice; the other side was open to the woods.
I/a Motte led the way to a door of the tower,
which lie now perceived was the same lie had
formerly entered; but lie found gome diffi-
culty in advancing, for the area wa* overgrown
with brambles and nettles, ami the light which
Peter carried afforded only mi uncertain
gleam. When lie unclosed the door, the
dismal aspect of the place revived the appre-
hensions of Madame lift Motte, antl extorted
from Adeline an inquiry whither they were
going. Peter held up the light to show the
narrow staircase that wound round the tower;
hut La Motte, observing the second door,
drew back the rusty bolts* and entered a spa-
cious apartment* which, from its ntyle and
condition, was evidently of a much later date
than the other part of the structure: though
desolate and forlorn, it was very little impaired
by time; the walls were damp, but not de-
cayed; and the glass was yet firm in the
windows,
They passed on to a suit of apartments
resembling the first they had seen, and ex-
pressed their surprise at the incongruoua
appearance of this part of the edifice with
the mouldering walls they had left hehinch
These Apartments conducted them to a
winding passage, that received light and air
through narrow cavities placed high in the
wall; and was at length closed by a door
barred with iron, which being with some
difficulty opened, they entered a vaulted
room. I* Mottc surveyed it with a ftcruti*
ntzing eye, and endeavoured to conjecture for
what purpose, it had been guarded by a door
of such strength; but he saw little within to
assint tm curiosity. The room appeared to
have been built in modern times upon a
Gothic plan, Adeline approached a large
window that formed a kind of recess raised
by one step over the level of the floor; the
observed to 1m Motto that the whole floor
wan inlaid with Mosaic work; which drew
from him, a remark, that the style of this
apartment was not strictly Gothic. He passed
on to a door which appeared on the opposite
side of the apartment, arid, unlocking it,
found himself in the great ball by which he
had, entered the fabric.
He now perceived, what the gloom had
hvfme concealed, » spiral ttaiwaie whidh led
to a- gallery above, awl which, Item Itt pt*»

the rooms they should pass the night, tlity
determined to return to thai which opened
from the tower.
A Ire wan kindled on a hearth* which it i$>
probable bad not for many yean before af-
forded the warmth of hospitality; arid 'Peter
having spread the provision lie had brought
from the coach, l«a Motte and bis family*
encircled round the ire, partook of a repast
which hunger and fatigue made delicious*
Apprehension gradually gave way to confi-
dence, for they now found themselves in
something like a human habitation, and they
had leisure to laugh at their late terror*; but,
m the blasts shook the doors, Adeline often
started, and threw a fearful, glance around.
They continued to laugh and talk cheerfully
for a time; yet their merriment was transient,
if not affected; for a sense of their peculiar
and distressed circunistances pressed upon
their recollection, and sunk each individual
into languor and pensive silence. Adeline
felt the forlornnesn of her condition with
energy; she reflected upon the past with
astonishment, and anticipated the future with
fear. She found herself wholly dependent
upon strangers, with no other ckhn than
what distress demands from, the common sym-
pathy of kindred beings; sighs swelled her
heart, and the frequent tear startsd to her
eye; but she checked it, ere it betrayed on
her cheek the sorrow which she thought It
would be ungrateful to reveal.
iia Motte at length broke this meditative
silence, by directing the fire to be renewed
for the night, and the door to be secured e
this seemed a necessary precaution, even in this
solitude, and was effected by means of large*
stones piled against it, for other tautening
there was none. Jt had frequently occurred
to La Motte, that this apparently forsaken
ediiee might be a place of refuge to banditti.
Here wan' solitude to conceal them; and a 
wild and extensive forest to assist their
schemes of rapine, and to perpfex with its
labyrinths those who might be bold  enough
to attempt pursuit. These apprehensions,
however, he hid within his own boMpi, saving
his companions from a filiate &f the uneasiness
tiiey occasioned. Peter was ordered to watch
at the door; and having given the &e . *

; The night passed on without disturbance.
Adeline slept, but uneasy dreams ieeted "be-
fore her fancy, and she awoke at an early
hourt'thc recollection of her sorrows arose
upon bet mind, and yit-Ming to their pres-
sure, her tears flowed silently and fast That
she "might indulge them without restraint,
she went to a window that looked upon an
open 'part of the forest; all was gloom and
silence j she' stood for some time viewing the
shadowy scene.
The :I«t tender tints of morning now ap-
peared on the verge of the horizon, stealing
upon the darkness;—so pure, so fine, so
etherial! It-seemed as if heaven was opening
to the view. The dark mists were seen to
roll off* to the west, as the tints of light grew
stronger, deepening the obscurity of th %i part
of the hemisphere, and involving the features
of the country below; meanwhile, In the
, e%st, the hues became more vivid, darting a
trembling lustre far around, till a ruddy glow,
which fired all that part of the heavens, an-
nounced the rising sun. At first, a small
line of inconceivable splendour emerged on
the horizon, which quickly expanding, the
sittt appeared in all his glory, unveiling the
whole face 'of nature, vivifying every colour
of the landscape, and sprinkling the dewy
earth with glittering light. The low and gentle
responses of birds, awakened by the morning
ray, now broke the silence of the hour; their
soft warblings rising by degrees till they
swelled the chorus of universal gladness.
Adeline's heart swelled too with gratitude
• and adoration.
The scene before her soothed her mind, and
'exalted her1 thoughts to the great Author of
Nature; she uttered an involuntary prayer:
Father1 of good, who made this glorious
icette! 1 resign myself to'thy hands: thou
wilt support me under my present sorrows,
and to protect me "from future evil.
Thus confiding in the benevolence of God,
she wiped the tears from her eyes, while the
sweet union of conscience and reflection re-
warded'her trust; and her mind, losing the
feelings which had lately oppressed it, became
tranquil and composed*
"7 lis, "Motte'awoke soon after, and Peter
prepared' to set out on his expedition* As
ne mounted his horse, An* please you, master,
said' he, I think we ahd as good look no

lj&ht, it's none so bad, but what a little
patching ' up , would make it comfortable

thought of Peter's words, * During the in-
tervals of the night, when anxiety had kept

this place afforded it. The desolation of the
spot was repulsive to his wishes; but lie had
only a choice of evils—a forest with liberty
was not a bad home for one who had too
much reason to expect a prison. An he
walked through the apartments, and ex-
amined their condition more attentively, he
perceived they might easily be made habit.
able; and now surveying them tinder the
cheerfulness of morning, his design strength-
ened; and he mused upon the means of ac-
complishing it, which nothing seemed so
much to obstruct as the apparent difficulty of
procuring food*
He communicated his thoughts to Madame
La Motte, who felt repugnance to the scheme.
1m Motte, however, seldom consulted his
wife till he had determined how to act; and
he had already resolved to be guided in this
affair by the report of Peter. If he could
discover a town in the neighbourhood of the
forest, where provisions and other necessaries
could be procured, he would seek no further
for a place of rest.
In the mean time he spent the anxious
interval of Peter's absence in examining the
rain, and walking over the environs; they
were sweetly romantic, and the luxuriant
woods with which they abounded, seemed to
sequester this spot from the rest of the world.
Frequently a natural vista would yield a view
of the country, terminated by hills,'which
retiring in distance faded into the blue hori-
zon. A stream, various and musical in its
course, wound at the foot of the lawn on
which stood the abbey; here it silently glided
beneath the shades, feeding the flowers that
bloomed on its banks, and diffusing dewy
freshness around; there it spread in broad
expanse to day, reflecting the sylvan scene,
and the wild deer that tasted its waves. La
Motte observed every where a profusion of
game; the pheasants scarcely fiew from his
approach, and the deer gazed mildly at him
as he passed* They were strangers to man!
On his return to the abbey, La Motte
ascended the stairs that led to the tower.
About halfway up, a door appeared in the
wall; it yielded, without resistance, to his
hand; but a sudden noise within, accompanied
by a eloud of dust, made him step back and
close the door. After waiting a few minutes,
he again opened it, and perceived a large room
of the more modern building. The remains oi
tapestry hung in tatters upon the walls, which
were become the residence of birds of prey,
whose sudden flight on the opening of the
door had brought down a quantity of dust,
and occasioned the noise. The windows were
shattered, and almost without glass; but he
was surprised to observe some remains of
furniture; chairs, whose fashion and condi-
tion bore the date of their antiquity; a broken

table, ami an iron grate almost consumed by
rust.
On the opposite side of the room was a
door which led to another apartment, propor-
tioned like the fiwt, hut hung with artm
somewhat less tattered In one aimer stood
s small bedstead, and a few shattered chain
were placed round the walls. La Motte gazed
with a mixture of wonder and curiosity. *Tis
strange, said hef that these rooms, and these
alone, should bear the marks of inhabitation;
perhaps, some wretched wanderer like myself,
may have here sought refuge from a perse-
cuting world; and here, perhaps, laid down
the load of existence; perhaps, too, 1 have
followed his footsteps, but to mingle my dust
with his! He turned suddenly, and was
about to quit the room, when he perceived a
small floor near the bed; it opened into a
closet, which was lighted by one AmaU win-
dow, and was in the same condition as the
apartments he had passed, except that it was
destitute even of the remains of furniture. As
he walked over the floor, he thought he felt
one part of it shake beneath his steps, and,
examining, found a trap door. Curiosity
prompted him to explore further, and with
some difficulty he opened it It disclosed a
staircase which terminated in darkness. La
Motte descended a few steps, but was unwill-
ing to trust the abyss; and, after wondering
for what purpose it was so secretl? constructed,
he closed the trap, and quitted this suit o(
apartments.
The stairs in the tower above were so much
decayed, that he did not attempt to ascend
them: he returned to the hall, and by the
spiral staircase which he had observed the
evening before, reached the gallery, and found
another suit of apartments entirely furnished,
very much like those below.
Ife renewed with Madame La Motte his
former conversation respecting the abbey, and
she exerted all her endeavours to dissuade
him- from his purpose, acknowledging the
olitary security of the spot, but pleading that
other places might be found equally weE
idapteu' for concealment and more for com-
fort. This 1a Motte doubted; besides, the
forest abounded with game, which would, at
once, afford bim siriusetaent and food, a cir-
cumstance, considering his small stock of
money, by no means to be overlooked; and he
had suffered his mind to dwell so much upon
the scheme, that it was become a favourite
one. Adeline listened in anxiety to the dis-
course, and waited the issue of Peter's report.
The morning passed but Peter did not re-
turn. Our solitary party took their dinner of
the provision they had fortunately brought
with them, and afterwards walked forth into
the woods, Adeline, who never suffered any
good to pass unnoticed because it came at*
tended with evil, forgot for a while the deso-
lation of the abbey in the benuty of |h«
adjacent scenery. The pleasantness of tlis
shade* soothed her hmrt^ and the varied
features of the landscape amused her fancy;
she almost thought she could be-contented to
live here. Already she begpw to feel an
interest in the concerns of her companions,
and for Madame La 31 otto she felt more;
it was the warm emotion of gratitude and
affection.
The afternoon wore away, and they re-
turned to the abbey, Peter was still absent,
and his absence now began to excite surprise
and apprehension. The approach of darkness
also threw a gloom upon the hopes of the wan*
derers: another night must be passed under
the same forlorn circumstances as the pre-
ceding one I and, what was still worse, with
a very scanty stock of provisions. The for-
titude of Madame La Motte now entirely
forsook her, and she wept bitterly. Adeline's
heart was as mournful as Madame**, but she
rallied her drooping spirits, and gave the first
instance of her kindness by endeavouring to
revive those of her friend.
La Motte was restless and uneasy, and,
leaving the abbey, he walked alone the way
which Peter bad taken. He had not gone

trees,leading his horse.—What news, Peter?
hallooed La Motte, Peter came on, panting
for breath, and said not a word, till La
Motte repeated the question In a tone of
somewhat more authority. Ah, bless you,
master! said he, when he had taken breath
to answer, 1 am glad to see you; i thought

Motte, But how came you in this condition t

and endeavoured to proceed* When, 1 left

you directed, and turning to the right of that
grove of trees yonder,'! looked this way aal

Is It impossible for you to speak to the
point ? 'said La Motte s omit these foolish par-
ticular*, and tell whether yon have succeeded,
 Well, then, master, to be short, for that's
the nearest way after all, I wandered a long
while at random, I did not know where, all
through a forest like this, and I took special
care to note how the trees stood, that I might
find my way back. At last f came to another
'path, and was*, sure 1 should find something

gave my horse a lash that sounded through

tttum without my business.
 Bo be less tedious, said La Motte, if It is

. -It is "in my nature, answered Peter, and if
it wag ntorc in my nature your honour should

And what have you got in that basket?
Why, master, 1 bethought me that we
could not get away from this place till the
carriage was ready to draw us, and m the mean
time, says I, nobody can live without victuals,
so 111 efen lay out the'little money I have
and take a basket with me.
Thal*§ the only wise thing you have done
yet, and this, indeed, redeems your blunders.
Why now, master, it does my heart gom!
to hear you speak; I knew I was doing for
the best all the while: but I've had a hard
job to find my way back; and here's another
piece of ill luck, for the horse has got a thorn
in his foot.
La Motte made inquiries concerning the
town, and found it was capable of supplying
him with provision, and what little furniture
was necessary to render the abbey habitable,
This intelligence almost settled his plans,
and'he ordered Peter to return on the follow-
ing morning and make inquiries concerning
the abbey. If the answers were' favourable
to his wishes, he commissioned him to buy a
cart and load it with some furniture, and
some materials necessary for repairing the
modem apartments. Peter stared: What,
does your honour mean to live here?
Why, suppose I do?
Why, then your honour has made a wise
determination, according to my hint; for your
honour knows*! said-
Well, Peter, it is not necessary to repeat
what you said; perhaps I had determined on
the subject ^before.
£gad,(master, you're in the right, and I'm
glad of it, for I believe we shall not quickly
be disturbed here, except by the rooks and
o.fls. Yes, yes—I warrant I'll make it a
.place fit for a king; and as for the town, one
may get any thing, I'm sure of that; though
they think no more about this place than they
do about India or England or any of those
places.'
They now reached the abbey, where Peter
was received with great Joy: 'but the hopes'
of his mistress and Adeline were repressed,
when they learned that he returned without
having executed his commission, and heard
his account of the town. La Motte's orders
to Peter were heard with almost 'e^ual'con-
cern by Madame and Adeline; but the latter
concealed her uneasiness, and used all her
efforts to overcome that of her friend. "The
sweetness of hei behaviour, and the* air of
satisfaction she assumed, sensibly affected
Madame, and discovered to her a' source of
comfort which she had hitherto overlooked.
The affectionate attentions ' of her young
friend  promised to console' her for the want
of other society,, and 'her conversation tt>
enliven the hours which might otherwise' be"
passed in paifjfttl regret* '•   i,,;

by the intrinsic value of a heart
That might 1m» «umr»(><l In chrystal,

Annette now kindled the fire for the? night:
Peter** basket was opened, and supper pre-
pared, Madame La Motte was still pensive
and silent,-—There is scarcely any condition
so bad, said Adeline, but we may one time
or the other wish we had not quitted it.
Honest Peter, when he was bewildered iu the
forest, or had two enemies to encounter in-
stead of one, confesses he wished himself at
the abbey. And 1 am certain, there is uo
situation so destitute, but comfort may lie
extracted from it. The blaze of this lire
shines yet more cheerfully from the con-
trasted dreariness of the place; and this
plentiful repast is made yet more delicious
from the temporary want we have suffered.
Let us enjoy the good and forget the evil.
Vou speak, my clear, replied Madame La
Mottc, like one whose spirits have not been
often depressed by misfortune (Adeline
sighed), and whose hopes are therefore vigor-
ous* Long suffering, said La Motte, has
subdued in our minds that elastic energy
which repels the pressure of evil and dances
to the bound of joy. Hut I speak in raph-
sody, though only from the remembrance of
such a time. 1 once, like you, Adeline,
could extract comfort from most situations.
And may now, my dear Sir, said Adeline,
Still believe it possible, and you will find it
is so.
The illusion is gone—1 can no longer
deceive myself.
Pardon me, ^If*, if 1 say, it is now only
you deceive yourself, by suffering the cloud
of sorrow to tinge every object you look upon.
It may be so, said La Motte, but let us
leave the subject,
After supper, the doors were secured, m
before, for the night, anil the wanderers re-
signed tliemselves to repose.
On the following morning, Peter again set
out for the little town of Arboine, and the
hours of, his absence were again f>pent by
Madame La Alette and Adeline in mucn
aniiety and some hope, ftir the intelligent*;
he might bring concerning the abbey might
vet release them from the plan* of,!** jtlotte.
'.Towards the close of the clay lie was <k>scried
coming slowly an; and th* cart, which
accompanied him, too certainly confirmed
their fears. lie brought materials far mpairing
tiie place, and twine furniture*
Of the abbey he gave an account, of whkli
the following is the substance t—4t belonged.,
together with a large part of tiie adjacent
forest, to a nobleman, who now resided with
his family on a remote estate* He itilierttwl
it, in right of his wile, from his father-in*
law, who had caused the more modern apr*r»-
ments to be erected, and had reside*! iu them
some part of every year, for the purpose pi*
shooting and hunting. It was reported, that
some person was, soon after it came to the f»f»»
sent possessor, brought secretly to the abbey
and confined In these apartments; who. or
what he was, had never been conjectured, and
what became of him nobody knew. The
report died gradually away, and many person*
entirely disbelievcu the whole of it. Hut
however this affair might be, certain it was,
the present owner hail visited the abbey only
two summers since his succeeding t© it| and
the furniture after some time, was removed.
This circuiiMtance had at first excited
surprise, and various reports rose in conse-
quence, but it was difficult to know what
ought to be believed. Among the reft, it
was said that strange appearance* had been
observed at the abbey, and uncommon noises
heard; and though this report had been
ridiculed by sensible persons as the idle
Mipcrstition of ignorance, it had fastened so
strongly upon the minds of the common
people, that for the last seventeen year*
none of the peasantry bad ventured to ap-
proach the spot. The abbey wis now, there*
fore, abandoned to decay.
La Motte ruminated upon this account*
At first it called up unpleasant idea*, but
they were soon dismissed, and considevatioita
more interesting to his welfare took place:
he congratulated himself thai he had  now
found a spot where he wax not likely m be
either discovered or disturbed; yt«t It could
not escape biro that there was a strange wiftei-
dence between one part of Peter's narrative,
and the condition of the chambers .that
opened from the tower above stairs." The
remains of furniture, of which A© other
apartments were void—the solitary bed—the
number and connexion of the rooms, were
circumstances that united to con firm his opU
nion. This, however, he concealed in bin
own breast, for lie already perceived that

But they had only to submit In silence.
 
 
THE. 86MANCI3 OF THB FOREST.
 
and whatever disagreeable apprehension might
intrude; upon them, they now appeared will-
ing to suppress the expression of it* Peter,
indeed, was exempt from any evil of this
kind; -he knew no fear, and his mind was
now wholly occupied with his approaching
business, Madame La Motte, with a placid
kind of despair, endeavoured to reconcile her*
self to that which no effort of understanding
could teach her to avoid, and which an in-
dulgence in lamentation could only make more
intolerable. Indeed, though a sense of the
immediate inconveniences to. be endured at
the abbey had .made her oppose the scheme
of living there, she did not really know how
their situation could be improved by removal:
yet .her thoughts often wandered towards
Paris, and reflected the retrospect of past
times, with the images of weeping, friends
left, perhaps, for ever. The affectionate en.
dearmentB of her only son,' whom, from the
danger of his situation, and the obscurity of
hers, the'might reasonably fear never to see
again, arose upon he? memory and overcame -.
her fortitude* Why—why was 1 reserved for'
this homf? would she say, and what will-be
my years to come?
Adeline had no retrospect of past delight
to give emphasis to present calamity—no
weeping friends~~no dear regretted objects to
point the edge -of sorrow, and throw a sickly
line upon her future prospects: she knew not
yet the pangs of disappointed hope, or the
acuter sting of self-accusation; she had no
misery but what patience could assuage, or
fortitude overcome*
At the dawn of the following clay Peter
arose to his labours he proceeded with ala-
crity, and in a few. clays two of the lower
apartments were so much' altered for the better
that Ia Motte began to exult, and his family
to perceive .that their situation would not be
so miserable as they had imagined. The
furniture Peter 'had' already brought was dis-
posed in' these rooms, one o£ which* was the
vaulted.apartment. Madame La Motte furw
wished this: as a sitting-room, prefering it
for it§ large Gothic window, that descended
almost to the floor, admitting a prospect of
the lawn, and the picturesque scenery of the.
surrounding'woods* 
Peter having returned to Aubolne for a.
further supply, all the lower.apartments were
in a few weeks not only habitable, but com-
fortable. These,.however, being insufficient
for the. accommodation of. the family, a room
above stairs was prepared .for Adeline: it was
the chamber that opened immediately from*
the tower, and she prefered it to those beyond,
because it'was less distant from the family,
and the windows fronting an avenue of the
forest' afforded a more  extensive prospect
The tapestry, that was decayed, and,, hung
loosely from the walls* was now nailed' tip,
and made to look less desolate! and though
the room had still a solemn aspect, from it§
spaciousness and the narrowness of the win-
dows, it was not uncomfortable.
The first night that Adeline retired hither,
she slept little: the solitary air of the place
affected her spirits; the more so,' perhaps,
because she had, with friendly consideration,
endeavoured to support them in the presence
of Madame La Motte. She remembered the
narrative of Pete?, several circumstances of
which had impressed her imagination in spite
• of her reason,-and she found it difficult wholly
to subdue apprehension* • At one time, terror
so strongly seized her' mind, that she had
even opened the door with an intention, of
calling Madame, lia Motte; but, - listening
for a moment on the stairs of the tower,, every
thing seemed still: at length, fthe heard the
voice of Im Motte speaking cheerfully, and
the absurdity of her feass struck her forcibly;
she blushed that the had for a moment sub*
mitted to them, and returned to 'her chamber
wondering at herself.

SHFABtSPBAHH,
La Motte arranged his little plan of living.
His mornings were usually spent in shooting
or fishing, and the dinner, thus provided by
his industry, he relished with a keener appe-
tite than had ever attended him at the luxuri-
ous tables of Paris. The afternoons he passed
with his family: sometimes he would select a
book from the few he had brought with luiu,
and endeavoured to fix his attention to the
words his lips repeated:—-but his mind suf-
fered little abstraction from its own cares,
and the sentiment he pronounced left no trace
behind it. Sometimes he conversed, but 
oftener sat in gloomy silence, musing upon
the past, or anticipating the future
At these moments, Adeline, with a sweet-
ness almost irresistible, endeavoured to enliven
his spirits, and to withdraw him from himself.
Seldom she succeeded; but when she did, ttie
grateful looks of Madame La Motte, and the
benevolent feelings of her own bosom,- rea-
lized the cheerfulness she had at first only
assumed. Adeline's mind had the happy
art, or, perhaps, it were" more justlo say, the
happy nature, of accommodating itself to her
situation* Her present condition, though'
forlorn, was not devoid of comfort, and this
comfort was'confirmed'by her virtues.  So
much she won upon the affections of her pro-
tectors, that Madame La Motte loved- her as

her child, anil !* Motte himself, though &
mam little susceptible of tenderness, could not
be insensible to her solicitudes. Whenever
he relaxed from the snllenness of misery, It
was ftt the influence of Adeline.

provision* from Auboine, and, on those occa-
sions, always quitted the town by a route eon.
trary to that leading to the abbey. Several
weeks having passed without molestation. La
Motte dismissed all apprehension of pursuit,
and at length became tolerably reconciled to
the complexion of his circumstances.
As habit and effort strengthened the forti-
tude of Madame 1a Motte, the features of
misfortune appeared to soften. The forest,
which at first seemed to- her a frightful soli-
tude, had lost its terrific aspect; and that
edifice, whose half demolished walls and
gloomy desolation had struck her mini with
the force of melancholy and dismay* was now
beheld as a domestic asylum, and a safe refuge
from the storms of power*
She was a sensible and highly-accomplished
woman, and it became her chief delight to
form the rising graces of Adeline, who had, as
bus been already shown, a sweetness of dispo-
sition, which made her quick to repay in-
struction with improvement, and indulgence
with love. Never was Adeline so pleased as
when she anticipated her wishes, and neve? so
diligent as when she was employed in-her
business. The little affairs of the household
she overlooketl and managed with such admir-
able exactness, that Madame La Motte had
neither anxiety nor care concerning them.
And Adeline formed for herself In this barren
situation, many amusements that occasionally
banished the remembrance of her misfortunes.
1m Motte's books were her chief consolation.
With om« of these she would frequently ram-
ble into the forest, where the river, winding
through a glade, diffused coolness, and with
its murmuring accents invited repose; there
she would seat herself, and, resigned to the
illusions of'the'page, pass many hours in
oblivion of sorrow.
Here too, when her mind wst» tranquillized
by the surrounding scenery, she wooed the
gentle muse, and indulged in ideal happiness.
The delight of these moments she commemo-

Madame La Motte had frequently ex»
pressed curiosity concerning the events of
Adeline's life* and by what circumstances she
had been thrown into a situation so perilous'
and mysterious as that in which 1a Motte
had found her. Adeline had given1 a brief'
account of the manner in which she had beat
brought thither, but had always with tea.fi 
entreated to be spared for that time from' a
partial lar relation of her history. II er spiff is
were not then equal to retrospection $ but now
that they were soothed by quiet, and strength-
ened by confidence, she one day gate Madame
La Motte the following narration.

but of small fortune, who (m many yeart
resided at Paris, Of my mother 1 'hi*?e a

thought he had little tenderness for me. But

whom I could look up for protection and love*,<

by the influence of he? ideal host, and was
resolute In rejecting the veil. Here I passed
several yews of miserable resistance against
cruelty and superstition. My father I seldom
saw; when T did, I entreated him to alter
my destination; but lie objected that his
fortune was- insufficient to Support me in the
worlds and at length denounced vengeance on
my head if 1 persisted in. disobedience*
irou, my dear Madam, can form little idea
of tlte-'Wtetcbedaesa of my situation, con-
deinned. to perpetual imprisonment, and im-
prisonment of the most, dreadful kind, or to
the vengeance of a father, from whom I had
no appeal* My resolution relaxed—for some .
time 1 paused upon the choke of evil^—.but
at length the horrors of 4he-*aoi!astic life rose
m fully to my view,, that, fortitude gave way
before them. Excluded * from the  cheerful,
intercourse of society—.from the pleasant view"
of n»tore—almost from the light of day-
condemned to silence—?igid • formality—ab-
stinence and penance—-cbtfdewitied to forgo
the delights of a world which imagination
painted in the gayest and most • alluring co-
lours, and whose hues were, perhaps, not the
less captivating-because they were only ideal
—-such wan the sate to which I was destined.,
Again my' resolution was invigorated: my -
father's cruelty subdued tenderness, and'
roused indignation.  Since he can forget,
said I, -the affection of a parent, and condemn
his child without remorse to wretchedness
and despair—-the bond of filial and parental •
duty no longer subsists between us—he has 
himself dissolved it," and I will yet struggle
for liberty and life.
Finding me. unmoved by menace, the Lady
Abbess had now recourse to more subtle
imeajswres t she condescended to smile, and
even I© flatter; but hers was the distorted
smile of cunning, not the gracious emblem of
kindness; it provoked disgust, instead of
inspiring affection, She painted the character
of a vestal in the most beautiful tints of art-
its holy innocence-—its mild dignity-—its sub-
lime devotion. 1 sighed as she spoke. This 
she regarded as a favourable symptom, and
proceeded on her picture with more anima-
tion. She described the serenity of a monastic
life—-its security from the seductive charms,
restless passions, and sorrowful vicissitudes-
of the world—the rapturous delights of re-
ligion, and the sweet reciprocal affection of
the 'sisterhood.
So 'highly she finished the piece, that the
lurking lines of cunning would, to an inex*
penanced eye, have escaped detection* Mine
was- too sorrowfully informed. Too often-
had 1 witnessed'the secret tear and bursting'
sigh of vain regret, the sullen pinings of db
content, and the . mute anguish of despair
My silence and my manner assured her or'my
incredulity, and it was with difficulty'that
she preserved a decent composure.
Miy father, as may be imagined, was
highly incensed at mj perseverance, which
he called obstinacy; but,' what will not by
so easily believed, he soon after relented,
and appointed a clay to take me from the
convent, O I Judge of my feelings when I
received this intelligence. The joy it occa-
sioned awakened all my gratitude; I forg<a
the former cruelty of my father, and that the
present indulgence was less the effect of his
Kindness than of my resolution. I wept that
I could not indulge his-every wish.
What days of blissful expectation were
those that preceded my departure! The
worlds from which I bad been hitherto r«-
€iuded-**the world, in which ray fancy had
been jo often delighted to roam~*whbge paths
were strewn with fadeless:roses—whose ever?
scene smiled in beauty and invited .to delight
—where all the people were good$ and'mil the
good happy—Ah ! then that world was burst-
ing upon my view. Let me catch the raptu-
rous remembrance before it vanish !. It is
like the pacing lights of autumn,' that gleam
for a moment on a hill, and then leave it to
darkness. 1 counted the days and hour* that
withheld me from this fairy land. It was in
the convent only that people weie deceitful
and cruel; it was there only that misery
dwelt 1 was quitting it all! Howl pitied
the poor nuns that were to be left behind!
I would have given half that world 1 prized
so much, had it been mine, to have taken
them outtwith me.
The long wished for day at last arrived.
My father came, and for a moment my joy
was lost in the sorrow of' bidding farewell to
my poor companions, for whom I had never
felt such warmth of kindness as at this in-
stant I was won beyond the gates o£ the
convent. 1 looked around, me, and viewed
the vast vault of heaven no longer bounded t
by monastic walls, and the green earth ex-
tended in hill and dale to the round verge 
of the horizon! My heart danced. with de-
light, tears -swelled in my eyes, and for some
moments 1 was unable t© speak* My thoughts
rose to heaven in sentiments of gratitude to
the Giver of all good!
At length I 'returned to-my father; Bear
Sir, said I, how 1 thank you for my delive-
rance, and how- I-wish 1 could do every

very dissonant to the joy and gratitude which
I had but* moment before felt and expressed
to him.—.Pardon, Madam, a relation of these
trivial circumstances; the strong vicissitudes
of feeling which they impressed upon my
heart, make me think them important, when
they we, perhaps, only disgusting.
No, my dear, said Madame 1& Motto, they
art interesting to me; they illustrate little
traits of character, which I love to observe.
You are worthy of all my regards, and from
this moment 1 give my tenderest pity to your
misfortunes, and my affection to your good-
ness.
These words melted the heart of Adeline;
she kissed the hand which Madame held out,
and remained a few minutes silent. At length
she said, .May 1 deserve this goodness I and
may I ever be thankful  to God, who, in
giving me such a friend, has raised me to
comfort and hope I
My father's house was situated a few
leagues on the other side of Paris, and in our
way to it we passed through that city. What
a novel scene! Where were now the solemn
faces, the demure manners I had been accus-
tomed to see in the convent? livery coun.
tettauee was here animated, either by business
or pleasure; every step was airy, and every
smile was gay. Ail the people appeared
like friends; they looked and smiled at me;
I smiled again, and wished to have told them
how pleaded I was. How delightful, said 1,
to live surrounded by friends I
What crowded streets! what magnificent
hotels I what splendid equipages! 1 scarcely
observed that cite streets were narrow, or the
way dangerous. What bustle, what tumult,
what delight! 1 could never>ibe sufficiently
thankful that 1 was removed from the con-
vent. Again I • was going to express my
gratitude to my father, but his looks forbad
ma, and 1 was silent* I am too diffuse; even
the feint forms which memory teBecta of
pasted delight are grateful to the heart* The
shadow of pleasure is still ga»d upon with
a melancholy enjoyment, though the sttb.
stance is led beyond'our reach.
Having quitted Paris, which I left with
many sighs, and gazed upon till the towers of
every church dissolved in distance from my
view, jure entered upon a gloomy and unfre*
quentld road. It was evening' when we .
touched a wild heath; I looked round in
search of a human dwelling, but could find
none | and -not a human being was to be
seen, 1 experienced something of' what 1
used to feel In the content; my heart had
not been so sad tince I left It. Of my father,
who still sal in silence 1 Inquired if we were
near home? he answered in the affirmative.
Night came on, however,' before 'we reached
the place of our destination; It was ft lone
house on the waste; but 1 need not describe
it to you, Madam. When the carriage
stopped, two men appeared at the door, mi,
assisted us to alight i so gloomy were their
countenance*., and so few their vonls, I
almost fancied myself again in the convent;
certain it is, 1 had not seen such melancholy
faces since 1 quitted it- Js this a part of the
world 1 have so fondly contemplated V mlA f.
The interior appearance of the house 'Was
desolate and mean; 1 wa» *urpriscd that my
father had chosen such a place for his babita*
tion, and also that no woman was to be seen;
but 1 knew that inquiry would only product
a reproof, and was therefore silent* At
supper, the two men I hud before seen sat
clown with us; they said little, but leeificd
to observe me much, 1 wm confuted And
displeased; which my father noticing, frown*
ed *t them with & look which convinced me
he meant more than 1 comprehended. When
the cloth was drawn, my father took my
hand and conducted me to the dmr of my
chamber; having sot down the candle, and
wished me good night, he left me to my own
solitary thoughts.
How different were tliey 'fVom those I had
indulged a few hours before I then expect**
tion, hope, delight, danced before me; now
melancholy and disappointment chilled the
ardour of my mind, and discoloured my fu-
ture prospect. The appearance of every thing
around conduced to <Wpre*s me. On the
Hoar lay a small bed without curtains or
hangings; two old chain and a table were
all the remaining furniture in the room. 1
went to the window, with nit intention of
looking out upon the surrounding scene, and
found 'it was grated. 1 was shocked at this
circumstance, and comparing it with the
lonely situation and the strange appearance of
the house, together with the countenances and
behaviour of the men who had supped- with
us, 1 was lost in a labyrinth of conjecture.
At length 1 lay down to sleep i but the
anxiety of my mind prevented repose; gloomy
unpleasing Images flitted before my fancy,
and 1 fell into a sort of waking dreams 1
thought that 1 was in a lonely forest with my
father; his looks were severe, and bis ges-
tures menacing t .he upbraided me for leaving
tht convent, and while lie spoke, drew from
his pocket a mirror, which he held before my
face; I looked in it and saw, (my blood now
thrills as i repeat it) 1 saw myself wounded,
and bleeding profusely. Then I thought
myself in the house again? and suddenly
heard these words-, in accents  so distinct,
that for some time after 1- awoke 1 could
««rccly believe them ideal, Depart, this house,
destruction hovers here.

.1:8;
TUS,ROMANCE OF THE FOBE5T.
 
-I jras awateeaed by a footstep on the stairs;
;4t,was my father retiring to bis chamber; the
lateness .of the hour surprised me, for it was
.pa^t midnight. , -
fin the. folio wing, morning, the party of the
=prececting evening assembled at breakfast, and
were as gloomy and silent as before. The
table was, spread, by,a boy of my father's;
but the cook and the housemaid, whatever
they might be, were invisible..
The next morning I was surprised, on at*
tempting tp, leave my chamber, to find the door
locked.; 1 waited a considerable time before I
ventured to call; when I did, no answer was
returned; I then went to the window, and
called more loudly., but my own voice was
still the only sound •! heard. Near an hour
I passed in a state .of surprise .and terror not
to be described; .at' length I beard a person
coming up stairs, and 1 renewed the call; I
•was answered, that my father had that morn-
ing set off for Paris, whence he would return
in a few, days; in the meanwhile he had
ordered „me to be confined, in. my chamber.
On my expressing surprise and apprehension
•at this circumstance, 1 was assured I had
.nothing to fear, and that I should live as
well as if I was at liberty.
The latter part of this speech seemed to
contain an odd kind of comfort $ I made little
.reply, but submitted to necessity. Once more
I , was abandoned to sorrowful reflection:
what a day was the one I now passed ! alone,
and agitated with grief and apprehension. I
endeavoured to conjecture the 'cause of this
harsh treatment; and at length concluded it
was designed by my father, as-.a punishment
for my former disobedience. But why aban-
don me to, the power of strangers, to men,
whose countenances bore the stamp of villany
m strongly as to impress even .my inexpe-
rienced .mind with terror I Surmise involved
me only deeper in perplexity, yet I found it
impossible to forbear pursuing the subject;
and .the day, was .divided between.lamentation
.and conjecture.: Night at length came, and
such, a -night I JDarkness pEougnt new terrors i
J, looked, round the chamber for -some meani
<*f fastening, my,door on the inside, but could
perceive .;none;; at. last I contrived to place
the. bacjc .of a chair .in an .oblique direction, so
asi to render it secure. 
1 had scarcely done this, And lain down
-upon ray bed in my clothes, not to sleep, but
to watch,' when 1 heard a rap at the door of
the house, which was opened and shut so
quickly, that the person who had knocked,
seemed only to deliver, a letter or message.
Sooa ^ after, I heard voices at intervals in a
room below stairs, sometimes speaking very
low,, and sometimes rising all' together, as if
in, dispute*, Something more excusable than
curiosity made me .endeavour to distinguish
what was said, but. in vain; now and their a
word or two reached toe, and once 1 heard
my name repeated, but no more.
Thus passed the- hours till midnight, when
all became still. 1 had lain for 'some time in
a state between fear and hope, when 1 heard
the lock of my door gently moved backward
and forward; 1 started tip and listened; for a
moment it was still, then the noise returned,
and I heard a whispering without; my spirits
died away, but 1 wis yet sensible. Pre,
sently an effort was made at the door, as if to
force it; I shrieked aloud, and immediately
heard the voices of the men 1 had seen at
my father's table: they called loudly for the
door to be opened, and on my returning no
answer, uttered dreadful execrations. I had
just strength sufficient to move to the window,
in the desperate hopa of escaping thence; hut
my feeble efforts could not even shake the
bars. 01 how can I recollect thene moments
of horror, and be sufficiently thankful that'I
am now in safety and comfort!
They remained Home time at 'the door,
then they quitted it, and went down stairs.
How my heart revived at every step of their
departure! 1 fell upon my knees, thanked
Ciocl that he had preserved me this time, ami
implored his further protection.' 1 was rising
from this short prayer, when suddenly 1 heard
a noise in a different part of the room, and
on looking round, 1 perceived the door of a
small closet open, and two men enter the
chamber.
They seized me, and I sunk senseless in
their arms; how long I remained in this con-
dition I know not; but on reviving,' 1 per-
ceived myself again alone, and heard several
voices from below stairs. I had presence of
mind to run to the door of the closet, my
only chance of escape; but it was locked!
I then recollected it was possible that tlvj
ruffians might have forgot to turn the key of
the chamber door, which was held by the
chair; but here, also, I was disappointed*
I clasped my hands in an agony of despair,
and stood for some time immoveable.'.
A violent noise from below roused me, and
soon after I- heard people ascending the stairs;,
I now gave myself up i for lost. The steps
approached, the door of the closet was again
.unlocked. • I stood calmly,' and again saw,
the men enter the chamber; I neither spoke,
nor resisted: the faculties of my soul were
wrought up beyond the power of feeling; as
a violent blow on the body stuns for awhile
the sense of pain. They led me down stairs;
the door of a room below was thrown open,
and I beheld a stranger; it was then that my
senses returned; I shrieked and resisted, but
was forced along. It is unnecessary'to say
that this stranger was Monsieur. La Blottc,
or to add, that 1 shall for ever bl«s him as
my deliverer.
Adeline ceased to speak; Madame 1a
 
 
10'
 
Motte remained silent* There were twite
ciretinistanees in Adeline's narrative, which
mlml all her curiosity. She asketl if Adeline
believed her father to be a parly in this mys-
terious affair. Adeline, though it was im-
possible to doubt that lie had been principally
iuid materially concerned in some part of it,
thought, or said she thought, lie was innocent
of any intention against her life. Yet, what
motive, said Madame La JVlottc, could there
be for a degree of cruelty m apparently un-
profitable ?—-Here the inquiry ended; and
Adeline confessed she had pursued it till her
mind shrunk from;all further research.
The sympathy which such uncommon
misfortune excited, Madame La Mottc now
expressed without reserve, and this expression
of it strengthened the tie of mutual friend-
ship. Adeline felt her spirits relieved by the
disclosure she had made to Madame La
Mottc; and the latter acknowledged the value
of the confidence, by an increase of affec-
tionate attentions.

Abrupt the social board'to quit. Wharton,
La Motte had now passed above a month
in this seclusion | and his wife had the
pleasure to see him recover tranquillity and
even cheerfulness. In this pleasure Adeline
warmly participated;'and she might justly
have congratulated herself as one cause of
his restoration; her cheerfulness and delicate
attention bad effected what Madame La Motte's
greater anxiety had failed to accomplish. La
Motte did not seem regardless of her amiable
disposition, and sometimes thanked her in a
manner more earnest than was usual with him.
She, in her turn, considered him as her only
protector and now felt towards him the affec-
tion of a daughter.
The' time she had spent in this peaceful
retirement had softened the remembrance of
past events, arid restored her mind to its
natural tone; and when memory brought
back to her v|ew the former short and roman-
tic expectations of happiness, though she
gave a sigh to the rapturous illusion, she less
lamented the disappointment, than rejoiced
in her p *esent security and comfort.
But the satisfaction which La Motte's
cheerfulness diffused around him was of short
continuance; he became suddenly gloomy
and reserved,; the society of bis family was no
longer grateful to him; and he would spend
whole hours in the most secluded parts of the
forest, devoted to melancholy and secret grief.
lie did not, as formerly, indulge the humour
of his sadness, without restraint, in the pre-
sence of others ; he now evidently endeavour-
ed to conceal it, and affected it cheerfulness
that was too artificial to escape detection.
His servant Peter, either impelled hy cu-
riosity or kindness, sometimes followed hhu
unseen, into the forest. lie observed hhn
frequently retire to one particular spot, in a
remote part, which having gained, he always
disappeared, before Peter, who was obliged
to follow at a distance, could exactly notice
where. All his endeavours, now prompted
by wonder and invigorated by disappoint-
ment, were unsuccessful,' and' he was at
length compelled to endure the tortures of
unsatisfied curiosity.
This change in the manners and habits of
her husband was too conspicuous to prm
unobserved by Madame La Motte, who
endeavoured, by all the stratagems which
affection could suggest, or female in/cntion
supply, to win him to her confidence. He
seemed insensible to the influence of the
first, and withstood the wiles of the latter.
Finding all her efforts insufficient to dissipate
the glooms which overhung his mind, or to
penetrate their secret cause, she desisted from
further attempt, and endeavoured to submit
to this mysterious distress.
Week after week elapsed, and the same
unknown cause sealed the lips and corroded
the heart of La Motte. 'The place of his
visitation in the forest hud not been traced."
Peter had frequently examined round the
spot where his master disappeared, hut had
never discovered any recess which could be
supposed to conceal him. The astonishment'
of the servant was at length raised to an
insupportable degree, and he communicated
to his mistress the subject of it.
The emotion which this information ex-
cited, she disguised from' Peter, and reproved
him for the means he had taken to gratify his
curiosity. But she revolved this circumstance
in her thoughts, and comparing it with the
late alteration in his temper, her uncasiftegft
was renewed, and her'perplexity'considefawi^"
increased. After much consideration, bein^
unable to assign any other motive for' hi*
conduct, s^o began to attribute it to the
influence of illicit passion; and her"heart,
which now out-ran her judgment, confirmed
the supposition, and roused all the torturing.
pangs of jealousy.
(.'comparatively speaking, she bad never
known affliction till now ; she had abandoned
her dearest friends and connexions—had re-
linquished the gaieties, the luxuries, ''anA
almost the necessaries of life ;—fled wltlrher

Her beauty out of the question, who else,
indeed, could it be in *a spot thus secluded
from the world t
The same cause destroyed, almost at the
same moment, her only remaining comfort;
and when she wept that she could no longer
look for happiness in the affection of La
Motte, she wept also, that she could no
longer seek 'solace in the friendship of Adeline.
•She had too great an esteem for her, to doubt,
at first, the integrity of her conduct; but,
m spite of reason, her heart no longer ex-
panded to her with its usual warmth of kind-
ness. She shrunk from her confidence; and
as the secret brootlings of jealousy cherished
tor 'Suspicions, she became less Kind to her,

She now condescended to a meanness which
she had before despised, and, ordered Peter to
watch the steps of his master, in order to'
discover, if possible, the' place of his visita-
tion! So much did, passion win upon her
judgment, by time and indulgence, that she
sometimes ventured even' to douM the into*
grity of Adeline, and afterwards proceeded to
believe it possible that the, object of JU
Motte's rambles might, be, an assignation
with her. What suggested this conjecture
was, that Adeline frequently took long walks
alone in 'the forest, ancl'.sometimei was absent
from the abbey for many hours. This eta
cumstanccj which Madame La, Motte had at
first attributed'to Adeline's fondness for the
picturesque beauties of nature, now operated
forcibly upon her imagination* and she could
view it in no other light, than- as affording an
opportunity for secret conversation with her
husband.
Peter obeyed the orders of his mistress villi

his own curiosity. All his endeavours were,
however, fruitless; he never dared to folio*

that fortitude which is so necessary for our
preservation* " Adeline does- not weep, yet
her Mate is as wretched as your own, for 1
know not how long I shall be able to protect
her*'
 Notwithstanding her,, terror, this repioof
"touched the pride of Madame La Motte, who
dried-her tears, but disdained to reply, and
looked "at Adeline with a strong expression of
displeasure* As-they moved silently toward
the abbey, Adeline asked La Motte if he was
'sure'they were the king's officers who inquired
for htm. I cannot doubt it, he replied, who
else could possibly inquire for me? Ik-sides,
the behaviour of the man, who mentioned, my'
-iift«?»vi^t« the matter beyond a question.
Perhaps not, said Madame La Motte s-let
us wait till morning ere we set off* We may
then titid it will be unnecessary to go*
We nay, indeed | the king's officers would
probably by that time have told us as much,
lilt Mottewent to give orders to Peter. Set
tilt* in an hour! said Peter, Lord bless you,
master! only'consider the eoaeh wheel; it
would take me a day at least to mend it, for
your honour knows-1 never mended one in my
life*
'- This was a circumstance which La Motte
"had entirely overlooked. When they settled
-at the abbey, Peter had at first been too busy
in repairing the apartments, to remember the
carriage; -and afterwards,, believing it would
not«mie-kly be wanted, lie had neglected to do
it. ;-La Matte's temper .now- entirely forsook
-him,and Willi many execrations he ordered
'Pete*-to-go to work immtdiately: but on
«eardMngfot- the -materials formerly bought,
llicy were-no where to be found; and-Peter at
'length remembered, though he was prudent
'enough' to conceal this circumstance, that he
"bail-wed'the nails in repairing the abbey.
''It; wita now, "therefore, impossible to. quit
'the forest that night,, and La Motte had only
•id consider the most probable plan of conceal-
'inent, should -the officers of justice visit the
ruin before  tlio 'morning; a circumstance
which the thoughtlessness 9f Peter, in return-
ing from Auboine by the straight way, made
not unlikely.
At first, indeed, it occurred -to him, that,
though his family could not be removed, .he
-:might, himself take one of the horses, and
escape from the forest before night. But he
'thought'-there would still.be some, dapger of
detection in. the towns through which he must
pasts, and lie could not well bear, .the idea ©i
; .leafing hm fainily -unprotected, without,know-
ing when lie could return to them, or'whither
he could direct them to follow him, hti
Motte was not a man of very vigorous resolu-
tion, and he, was, perhaps, rather more willing
to suffer'in company than alone.
After much consideration, he recollected
the trapdoor of the closet belonging to the
chambers above. It was invisible to the eye
and whatever might be its direction, it would
securely shelter /mm, at least, from discover}'.
Having deliberated further upon the subject
he determined to explore the recess to wlitrh
the stairs led, and thought It possible that for
a short time his whole family might be con-
cealed within it. There was little time be.
twecn the suggestion of the plan and the exe-
cution of his purpose, for darkness was
spreading arountt, and in every murmur of
the wind he thought he heard the voices of
his enemies.
. . Me .called for a light, and ascended alone to
the chamber. When he came to the closet,
it was some time before he could find the
trap-door, so exactly did it correspond with
the boards of the floor. At length, he found
and raised it. The chill damps of long con-
fined air.ruxhed from the aperture, and lie
stood for, a moment to let them pass, ere lie
descended. As he stood looking down the
abyss, he recollected the report which Peter
had brought concerning the abbey, anil it
gave him an uneasy sensation. But this soon
yielded to more pressing interests.
The -stairs were steep, and in many places
trembled beneath his weight. Having con-
tinned to descend for seme time, his feet
touched the ground, and'he found himself in
a narrow passage; but as he turned to pursue
it, the damp vapours curled round him and
extinguished the light. 'He called aloud for
Peter, but could make nobody hear, and after
some time he endeavoured to find his way up
the stairs. In. this, with difficulty, he suc-
ceeded, and passing the chambers with cauti-
ous steps descended the tower.
The security which the place he had ;ust
quitted seemed to promise, was of too m .ich
importance to be slightly rejected, and he de-
termined immediately to make another expe-
riment with the light:—-having now feed it
in a lantern, he descended a second time to
the passage. The current of vapours occa-
sioned by the opening of the trapdoor was
abated* and the fresh air thence admitted hail
begun to circulate: La Motte passed on un-
molested.
The passage was ,of considerable length,
.and Jcil him to a dcor which'was fastened.
Hei placed the lanthcm at some distance, to
avoid -the current of'air,":and applied w*
strength to the door. It shook' "under his
hands, but did not yield. Uponexawinwg
it .more closely, he perceived' 'the1 wood'round
tlie,-,look was decayed, r/rbhably by the'dampH.
'and this encouraged him to proceed*'  Aiu*£
wwie time it gave way to his effort, anil lie
found himself in a square Mono room.
., lie stood for some time to survey it. The
walls* which were dripping with unwhole-
some dews, were entirely bare, and afforded
wot even a window. A small iron grate
alone admitted the air. At the further end,
near a low recess, was another door. 1a%
Motte went towards it, and, as he passed,
looked into the recess. Upon the ground
within it stood a large chest, which he went
forward to examine; and, lifting the lid, he
saw the remamtt of a human skeleton. Hor-
ror struck upon bin heart, and he involuntarily
stepped back. During a paose of some mo-
ments, his first emotion subsided. That
thrilling curiosity, which objects of terror
often excite in the human mind, impelled
him to take a second flew of this dismal
{spectacle.
La Motte stood motionless as he gazed;
I lie object before him seemed to confirm the"
report that some person had formerly been,
murdered in the abbey. At length lie closed
the chest, and advanced to the, second floor,
which also was fastened, but the key was in
the lock. He turned it with difficulty, and
then found the door was held by two strong
bolts. Having undrawn these, it disclosed a
flight of steps, which he descended. They
terminated in a chain of low vaults, or rather
cells, that, from the manner of their construc-
tion and present condition, seemed to be coe-
val with the most ancient parts of the abbey.
La Motte, in his Chen depressed state of mind,
thought them the burial places of the monks,
who formerly inhabited the pile above; but
they were more calculated for places of pe-
nance for the living, than of rest for the dead.
Having reached the extremity of these cells,
the way was again closed by a door. 1a
Motte now hesitated whether he should at-
tempt to proceed any further. The present
xpot seemed to afford the security he sought.
Here he might pass the night unmolested by
apprehension of discovery; and it was most
probable, that if the ©fleers arrived in the
night, and found the abbey vacated, they
would quit it before morning, or, at least,
before he could have any occasion to emerge
imm concealment. Theme considerations re-
stored his mind to a state of greater composure.
His only immediate care was to bring his
family, as soon as possible, to this place of
security, lest the officers should come un-
awares upon them; and while he stood thus
uui&ing* tie blamed himself for delay.
, Bat an irresistible desire of knowing to
what this door led, arrested his steps, and he,
turned .to open it, The door, however, was
fastened; and «t he attempted to force it, he
suddenly thought he heard a rtolce above. It"
now .occurred to, him that the officers might
already, feave arrived, and he quitted the cells
with precipitation, intending (o listen at the
trap-door. *'
There, salt! he, 1 may wait tii security, and
perhaps ntmr something of what fMMfftea* My
family will not be known, of at least not jbujet,
and tneir ttneaaineM on my account they mmt
learn to endure.  •  .
These were the argument*.of I* M©tt©f to
which, it iiviwt be owned, selfob prudence
was more conspicuous than tender anxiety for
his wife. He had by this time reached the
bottom of the stairs, when, on looking up, lie
perceived the trap«door was'left open; and
ascending in haste to close it* he heard.foot-
step'!* advancing through the chambers above.
Before he could descend entirely out of tight,
he again looked up, arid perceived through
the aperture the face of a man looking down
upon him, Blaster, cried Peter.-—La Motte
was somewhat relieved at the aound oT his
voice, though angry that'he bad occaaioncd
him mo much terror.
What  brings yon hetef aid what is the
matter below?
Nothing, Sir, nothing's the matter,, only
my mistress sent me to «ee after your honour*
There*** nobody there then ? said La Motte,
setting his foot 'upon the step. 
Yes, Sir, there is my mistrew and Made*
moisellc Adeline, and*—
Well—well—-said La Motte brakly, go
your ways, 1 am coming.
He informed Madame La Motte where he
had been, and of hi« intention of gectfting.
himself, and deliberated upon th*t mean*-of
convincing the officers, should. they, arrive,
that he had quitted the abbey*  For, thin pur-
pone he ordered ail the moveable furniture to
be conveyed to the cells below. Im Motte
himself assisted in thin bucinuss, and .every
hand was employed for dispatch. In a very
short time the habitable part of, the fabric
was left almost as deaolate as he bad found
it. He then bade Peter take the hoae* to *
distance from the abbey and tura them- loose.
After further consideration, he thought it
might contribute to mislead.- them, 4f he
placed in some connpicuouH part of,the. fabric
art inscription, signifying km coudifiou, and
mentioning the date of his departure from
the abbey.' Over the door of the tower which

therefore cut the following lines«

for those of tenderness.

La Motte, sighing, suppose, my dear, Peter
returns to .Anboine to-morrow? He may
there learn something more of this affair; cr,
at least, he might procure a carriage to con-
vey us hence.
To be sure'he might, said La Motte pee-
vishly, and people' to attend it also, peter
would be an excellent person to show the
officers the way to the abbey, and to inform
them of 'what they might else be in doubt
about, my concealment here.
How cruel is. this irony I -replied Madame
La Motte. I proposed only what I thought
would -be -for our niutoal good; 'my Judg-
ment was, perhaps, wrong, hut my intention
was certainly right. Tears swelled into her
eyes as she spoke these words. Adeline
wished to relieve her; but delicacy kept her
silent. La Motte observed the effect of his
sneech, and something like remorse touched
'his heart. i' He approached, and taking her
hand, You must allow for the perturbation of
my mind, said he,' 1 did not mean to afflict
you thus. The idea of sending Peter to
Auboine, where he lias already done so much
harm by his blunders, teased me, and 1 could
not let it pass unnoticed. 'No, my clear, our
only chance of safety is to remain where we
are white our provisions last. If the officers
do not come'here to-night, they probably will
to-morrow, or, perhaps, the next day. When
they have Bearcfied the abbey, without finding
me, they will depart; we may then emerge
from this recess, and take. measures for re-
moving to a.distant country.
^ Madame La Motte acknowledged the jus-
tice of his words; and her mind being re*
lieyed by the little apology he had made, she
became tolerably cheerful.,. Supper being

CHAPTER V."
A 8CBPmiSJU~AM MtVEH^UaB—-A
Thk night passed without any alarm; Peter
had remained upon his post, and beard no-
thing that prevented his sleeping. 1a Motto
-heard him, long before he iaw Mmf most
musically snoring; though It mast be owned
there was more of the bass than of any other
part of the gamut in his performance. He
was soon roused by the bravura of La Motte.
whose notes sounded discord to bis ears, aao
destroyed the torpor of his tranquillity.
Ooa bless you$ master! what's the matter?
cried Peter, waking, are they come?
Yes, for aught you care, they might be
come. Did I place you here to steep, sirrah?
Bless you, master, returned Peter, sleep i§

would not deny it to a dog hi such a place as

La Motte sternly questioned him concern-
ing any noise be might huve heard in the
night;' and Fe?tet fall,as solemnly protested
he had beard none; m assertion which waa

mult of his mind t, the agitation Of terror -sub-
sided; and reason beamed a feeble ray upon
liis hopet* , lie listened attentively; and per-'
ceivirig.' thai all was silent, advanced with
cautioil, to the stone room, and thence to the
foot "of the stairs that led, to the trap-door.
It was- closed: no sound was heard abovt*
He watched a long time, and the silence
continuing* his hopes strengthened; and at
length he began to believe that the officers
had quitted the abbey; the day, however,
was spent in anxious watchfulness. He did
not dare to unclose the trap-door; and he
frequently thought he heard distant noises.
It was evident, however, that the secret of
the closet had escaped discovery; and on this
circumstance he justly founded his security*
The following night was passed, like the day,
in trembling hope and incessant watching.
But the necessities of hunger now threat-
ened them. The. provisions, which had been
distributed: with the nicest economy, were
neatly exhausted!, and the most deplorable
contttguettcet might be expected,,from their
remaining longer in concealment. Thus cir«
cumstanced, La Motte deliberated upon the
most prudent method of proceeding. There
appeared no other alternative, than to send
 Peter to Anboine, the only town from which
he could return within the time prescribed by
their necessities. There was -game, indeed,
in*' the forest; but Peter could neither handle
a 'gun nor use a fishing rod to any advantage.
It was therefore agreed he should go to
Atibdin© for a supply of provisions, and at
the'same time bring materials for mending
the coaehowheel, that they might have some
ready conveyance from the forest. La Motte
forbade Piter to ask any questions concern-
ing the people who had inquired for him, or
tele 'amy methods for discovering whether
they had quitted the country, lest his blun-
ders should  again betray him* He ordered
him to be entirely silent as to these subjects,
and to finish* his business and leave the place
with aH possible dispatch.
A difficulty yet remained to be overcome—
Who should first venture abroad into the
abbey, to learn whether it was vacated by the
officers of justice P La Motte considered that
if he was again seen, he should be effectually
betrayed; which would not be so certain if
one'of his family was observed, for they were
all unknown to the officers. It was neces-
sary, however, that the person he sent should
have courage enough to go through with the
inquiry, and wit enough to conduct it with
caution. Peter, perhaps, had the first; but
wan certainly destitute of the last Annette
had neither. La' Motte looked at his wife,
and asked1 her if, for- his sake, she dared to
venture. Her heart shrunk from the pro-
'fmtitj yet she was unwiEing to refuse, or ap-
 'par' indifferent  upon a point so essential to
the safety of her bwband* Adeline ©bserved
in her countenance the agitation of her mind,
and, surmounting the fears which had hitherto
kept her silent, she offered herself to go.
They will be less likely to offend me, said
she, than a man.—Shame would not softer
La Motte to accept her offer; and Madame,
touched with the magnanimity of her conduct,
felt a momentary renewal or all her former
kindness. Adeline pressed her proposal no
warmly, and seemed so much in earnest, that
La Motte began to hesitate. Yon, Sir, said
she, once preserved me from the most immi-
nent danger, and your kindness has since pro-
tected me s do not refuse me the satisfaction
of deserving your goodness by a grateful re-
turn of it Let me go into tne abbey; and
if, by so doing, 1 should preserve yon from
evil, I shall be sufficiently rewarded for what
little danger 1 may incur,, for my pleasure
will be at least equal to yours.
Madame La Motte could scarcely refrain
from, tears as Adeline spoke; and La Motte
sighing deeply, "said, well,' be it so; go,
Adeline, and from this moment consider me
as your debtor.' Adeline staid not to reply,
but taking a light, quitted the cells, Jba
Motte following to raise the trap-door, and
cautioning her to look, if possible, into every
apartment before she entered it If yon should
be seen, said he, yon must account for your
appearance so as not to discover me. Your
own presence of mind may assist you, 1 can-
not—God bless yon I
When she was gone, Madame La Blotters
admiration of her conduct began to yield to
other emotions. Distrust gradually under-
mined kindness, and jealousy raised sus-
picions. It must be a sentiment more
powerful than gratitude, thought she, that
could teach Adeline to subdue her fears.
What, but love, could influence her to a con-
duct so generous! Madame La'Motte, when
she found it impossible to account for Ade-
line's conduct without alleging some interested
motives for it, however her suspicions might
agree with the practice of the world, had
surely forgotten how much she once admired
the purity and disinterestedness of "her young
friend.
Adeline, mean while, ascended to the
chambers: the cheerful beams of the sun
played once more upon her sight, and re-
animated her spirits; she walked lightly
through the apartments, nor stopped till she
came to the stairs of the tower. Here she
stood for some time, but no sounds met her
ear, save the sighing of the wind among the
trees, and at length she descended. She
passed the apartments below without 'seeing
any person, and the little furniture that
remained seemed to stand exactly as she had
left it. She now ventured to look out from
the tower; the only animate objects that

Without waiting Adeline's reply, he
sprang to the door of the tower. She now
thought it would betray a consciousness of
the truth 'of Ms conjecture to follow him, and
resolved f» remain below. But upon further
consideration, it occurred to her that he

ran to his young' master—shook bim by the
hand, in' spite of the frowns; of 'pa Motte;
ran every where, without knowing for; what,
and gave no rational' answer to any thing that
was said to him.
After their first emotions' were  subsided,
La Motte, as if suddenly recollecting himself, .
resumed his wanted solemnity: 1.' am _' to,

1 am still, perhaps' surrounded by danger.'
Let us secure a retreat while it is yet in our _
power, continued he; in a few Jiours the'
king's officers may search for me again.
Louis comprehended his fathers words, \
and immediately relieved his apprehensions
by the following relation;—. "" •
A letter from Monsieur Nemours, con-
taining an,account ofyottr 'flight from Paria,
reached me at Peronne, where 1 Was then
upon duty with my regiment He mentioned
that you were gone towards the south of
France, but as he had not since heard
from you, he waa ignorant of the place
of your refuge. It was, about this 'time
that I was dispatched into' Flanders; and
being unable to obtain further intelligence of
you, 1 passed some weeks' of very painful
solicitude. At the conclusion pf the cam- .
paten I obtained leave of absence, and Im-
mediately set out for Paris, hoping to learn
from Nemours where you had "found an
asylum.'
Of this, however, he was equally Ignorant
with myself. He informed, me that you had.
once before written to him 'from D~*—, upon
your second day's journey from Paris, under
an assumed name, as had been agreed upon;
and that you then said the fear of discovery
would prevent your hazarding another' letter*
He therefore remained ignorant of your abode,
but said he had no doubt you had continued
your journey to the southward. 'Upon this
slender -information I quitted Paris in search
of you, and proceeded immediately to *V~-~~,'
where my inquiries- concerning your further
progress were successful as far as M—-—'
There they told me you had staid some time, •
on account of the illness of a young lady; a
circumstance which perplexed me much, as 1
could not imagine what young lady would
accompany you. ' 1 proceeded, however,' to''"
L—; but there all traces of you seetnrf
to be lost." As I sat musing at the window
of the inn, I observed'some scribbling on the
glass, and the curiosity of idleness prompted
me'to read It. 'I thought 1 knew the chsrac-
 
 
80
 
t«% *nd A* Miles 1 ttftti confirmed nij oon-
jectures, for i remembered to have heard you
often repeat them.
Here 1 renewed my inquiries concerning
your route, and at length 1 made the people
»f the inn recollect you, and traced you as
far as Auboine. There I again lost you,
till upon my return from a fruitless inquiry
in the neighbourhood, the landlord of the
little inn where 1 lodged, told, me he believed
lie had heard news of you, awl immediately
recounted what had happened lit a Mack-
smith's shop a few hours before.
His description of Peter was so exact, that
1 had not a doubt it was you who inhabited
the abbey; and as I knew your necessity for
concealment, Peter's denial aid not shake my
confidence* The next morning, with the
assistance of my landlord, I found my way
hither, and having searched every visible
part of the fabric, I began to credit Peter's
assertion: your appearance, however, de-
stroyed this fear, by proving that the place
wes still inhabited, for you disappeared so
instantaneously.that I was not certain it was
you whom I had seen. 1 continued Reeking
you till near the close of day, and till then
scarcely quitted the chambers whence you
had disappeared, I called on you repeateoly,
believing that my voice, might convince you
of your mistake. At length I retired to pass
the night at a cottage near the border of the
forest
1 came early this morning to renew mv
inquiries, and hoped that, believing yourself
safe, you would emerge from concealment.
But how was I disappointed to find the abbey
as silent and solitary as 1 had left it the
preceding evening I I was returning once
more from the great hall, when the voice of
this young lady caught my ear, and effected
the discovery I had so anxiously sought
'This little narrative entirely dissipated the
late apprehensions of La Motte; but he now
dreaded that the'inquiries of his son, and his
own obvious desire of concealment, might
excite a curiosity amongst the , people of
Auboine, and lead to fi discovery of his true
circumstances. However, for the present he
determined to dismiss all painful thoughts,
and endeavour to enjoy the comfort which the
presence of his ion had brought him. The
furniture was removed to a more habitable
part, of the abbey, and the cells were again
abandoned to their own glooms.
The arrival of her son seemed to have
animated Madame La Motte with new life,

absorbed im joy,' She often gazed silently on.
hirij with a mother's' fondness,, and her par-
tiality heightened every improvement which
tirrje had wrought in his person, and manner.
He was. now in his twenty-third year.; his
person was manly and his air military; his
manners were unaffected and graceful, rather
titan dignified; and though his featuna wrtr©
irregular^ they composed a countenance which,"'
having seen it once, you would seek ife agala* 
She made eager inquiries' after the -.friend*;'
she had left at Paris, and learned'that within '.
the few months of her absence some hud'died \
and others quitted the place. La Motte- als©
learned that a very strenuous search for him
had been prosecuted at Fans; and, though-
this intelligence wan only what he had before
expected, it shocked him so much, that he
now declared it would be expedient to temove
to a distant country. Louis did not scruple
to say that he thought he would he as safe
at the abbey as at any other place; acid re-
petted what Nemours had said, thai the
King's officers had been unable to trace my
part of his route from Paris.
Besides, resumed Louis, this abbey is
protected by a supernatural power, and none-.'
of the country people dare approach it. •
Please you, my young master, said I'ster,
who was waiting, in the room, we were
frightened eno«gli the iirst night w6 came'
here, and I myself, Clod forgive mef thdaght'
the place was inhabited by devils, but they
were only owls, aad such like* after all.
Your opinion was not asked, said'  -L*

Peter was abashed. When he had quitted
the room, La Motte asked his .son irkh>
seeming carelessness, what west, the - refKOtsv'
circulated by the country people? O!  Sir,
replies Louis, I cannot recollect half of them t
1 remember, however, they  said' that* many 
years ago, a person (but nobody had -ever
seen him, so we may judge how far the report
ought to be credited)—* person was prfrrfctely -
brought to this abbey, and conined in some 
part of it, and that there was strong- reg|S0t»
to believe he came unfairly to his end*' -
La Motte sighed. rl*hey further said, eon*';
tinned Louis, that the spectre of the deeossect
had ever sirtpe watched nightly mmmm the?

mde*4 mff that the person who was brought
here, was never known to depart; but I do
not fi»4 it certain' that, he ever arrived: that
there was strange, privacy and mystery ob-
served,, while he was here, and that the abbey
fap neter since been Inhabited by its owner.
There seems, however, to be nothing in all
this that, deserves to be remembered,—La
Motte raised his head, as if to reply, when
the entrance of Madame turned the discourse
<upon a new subject, aiid it was not resumed
that day.
Fetter was now dispatched for provisions,
while La Motte and Louis retired to consider
how far it was safe for them to continue at
the abbey. La Motte, notwithstanding the
assurances lately given him, could not but
think that Peter's blunders and Ids son's in-
quiries might lead to a discovery of his resi-
lience. . lie revolved this in his mind for
«oin$ time; but at length a thought struck
him, that the latter of these circumstances
might considerably contribute to his security.
If you, said he to Louis, return to the inn at
Auttoine, from whence you were directed here,
and without seeming to intend giving intel-
ligence, do give the landlord an account of
your having fount! the abbey uninhabited,
and then add, that you had discovered the
residence of the person you sou^t in some
distant town, it would suppress any reports
that may at present exist, and prevent the
belief of any in future. And if, after all this,
you can trust yourself for presence of mind
and command .of countenance, so far as  to
describe some dreadful apparition, I think
these circumstances, together with the dis-
tance of the abbey and the intricacies of the
forest, could entitle me to consider this place
as iny castle.
Louis agreed to all that his father had pro-
posed, and on the following day executed his
. commission with such success, that the tran-
quillity of the abbey might be then said to
J»?f been entirely restored,
llhus ended this adventure, the only one
tbatjhad occurred/to disturb the family miring
their residence'in the forest. Adeline, re-
jnoved from the -apprehension of those evils
#idi m*hicli the late situation of La Motte had
threatened her, and from the depression which
her'interest in Mi occasioned her, now, experi-
enced a more than usual complacency of mind*
She thought, too, that she observed in
Madame La Motte a renewal of her former
kindness; and this circumstance awakened
all'her gratitude, and imparted to her a plea-
sure as lively as it was innocent. The satis-
faction with which the presence of her son
inspired Madame.La Motte, Adeline mistook
m 'kindness^ to herself, and she exerted her
whole attention in an endeavour to become
utorthy of It.
 Bin the joy whftifr his unexpected arrival
had given to La Motte quickly began to eva-
porate, and the gloom of despondency again
settled on his countenance. Me returned fre-
quently to his haunt in the forest—the name
mysterious sadness tinctured his manner, urn!
revived the anxiety of Madame La Motto,
who was resolved to acquaint her son with
this subject of distress, and solicit his assist-
ance to penetrate its source.
Her jealousy of Adeline, however, she
could not communicate, though it again tor-
mented her, and taught her to misconstrue
with wonderful ingenuity every look and
word of La Motte, and often to mistake the
artless expressions of Adeline's gratitude ami
regard for those of warmer tenderness. Ade-
line had formerly accustomed herself to long
walks in the forest, and the design Madame
had formed of watching her steps, had been
frustrated by the late circumstances, and was
now entirely overcome by -her sense of its
difficulty and danger. To employ Peter in
the affair, would be to acquaint him with her
fears; and to follow her herself, would most
probably betray her scheme, by making
Adeline aware of her jealousy. Being thus
restrained by pride and delicacy, she was
obliged to endure the pangs of uncertainty
concerning the greatest partof her suspicions.
To Louis, however, she related the mys-
terious change in his father's temper, lie
listened to her account with very earnest at-
tention, and the surprise and concern impressed
upon his countenance spoke how much his
heart was interested. lie was, however, in-
volved in equal perplexity with herself upon
this subject, and readily undertook to observe
the motions of La Motte, believing his inter-
ference likely to be of equal service, both to
his father and his mother. He saw, in some
degree, the suspicions of his mother ; but as he
thought she wished to disguise her feelings,
he suffered her to believe that she succeeded.
He now inquired concerning Adeline ; and
listened to her little history, of which his
mother gave a brief relation, with great ap-
parent interest. 80 much pity did he express
for her condition, and so much indignation at
the unnatural conduct of her father,, that the
apprehensions which Madame La , Motte
began to form,' of his having discovered her
jealousy, yielded to those of a different kind.
She perceived that the beauty of Adeline had
already fascinated his imagination, and she
feared that her amiable manners would soon
impress his heart. Had her first fondness
for Adeline continued, she would still have
looked with displeasure upon their attach-
ment, as an obstacle to the promotion and
the fortune she hoped to see one clay enjoyed
by her son. On these she rested all her fu-
ture hopes of prosperity, ai:d'rcgardtd thc_
matrimonial alliance which he might form as,'
the only means of extricating his family from
:«
 
their present difficulties. She- therefore touch-
ed lightly upon Adeline'* merit, Joined eotdly
with Louis, in compassionating her inisfor-
tunes, and with her censure of the father's
conduct mixed an implied swspteitwi of that
of Adeline's. The mean* rdie employed to
repress iIk4 passions of her son had a contrary
direct The indifference which she repressed
towards Adeline, increased his pity for her
destitute condition; and the tenderness with
which she affected to judge the father, height-
ened his honest indignation at hi* character.
As he quitted Madame La Motte, he saw
his father cross the lawn and enter the deep
shade of the forest on the It ft, He judged
this to he a good opportunity of commencing
his plan, and <fwitting the abbey, slowly fol-
lowed at a distance* La Motte continued to
walk straight forward, arid gecmed so deeply
wrapt in thought, that he looked neither to
the right nor left, and scarcely lifted his head
from the ground, Louis had followed him
near half a mile, when he saw him suddenly
htrikc into an avenue of the forest, which
took a different tli-»ction from the way he had
hitherto gone. He quickened his steps that
lie might not lose sight of him, hut, having
reached the avenue, found the trees so thickly
interwoven that La Motte was already hid
from his view.
He continued, however, to pursue the way
before him: it conducted him through the
most gloomy part of the forest he had yet
seen, till at length it terminated in an obscure
recess, over-arched with high trees, whose
interwoven branches secluded the direct rays
of the sun, and admitted only a sort of solemn
twilight Louis looked around in search of
La Motte, but he was no where to be seen.
While he stood .surveying the place, and con-
sidering what further should be done, he ob-
served, through the gloom, an object at some
distance, but the deep shadow that fell around
prevented his distinguishing what it was.
In advancing, lie perceived the ruins of a
small building, which, from the traces that
remained, appeared to have been a tomb. As
he gazed upon i^ Here, *atd he, are probably
deposited the ashes of some ancient monk,
once an inhabitant of the abbey; perhaps, of
the founder, who, after having spent a fife of
abstinence and prayer, sought in heaven the
reward of his forbearance upon earth. Peace
be to his soul! but did he think a life of mere
negative virtue deserved an eternal reward?
Mistaken roan! reason, had you trusted to
its dictates, would have informed you, that
the active virtues, the adherence to the golden
rule, Do as you would be done unto, could
alone deserve the favour of a Deity whose
glory is benevolence.
He remained with his tje$ fixed upon the
spot, and presently saw a figure arise under
tlie arcli of the sepulchre. It started, as if
on perceiving htm, and mtmediattly. di>-.
appeared, l*>ui«, though utilised to fear,'
Mt at that moment an uneasy wnsation, lmt
it almost immediately struck him that this wa*
La Matte himself. 'lie advanced to the ruin
and called him. No answer was returned ;.
and he repeated the fall, hut all was* yet still
as the grave. He then went up to tfie arch*,
way and endeavoured to examine the place
where he had disappeared, but the shadowy
obscurity rendered the attempt fruitless. He
obnerved, however, it little to the right, nil
entrance to the ruin, and advanced Home steps'
down a kind of dark passage, when, recollect-
ing tliiit this plaice might be the Itaujut of
banditti, his danger alarmed him, and lit*
retreated with precipitation.
lie walked towards the abbey by the way
he came ; and finding no person followed him,
and believing himself again in safety, hit
former surmise returned, and he thought it
was La Motte he had seen. He mused upon
this strange possibility, and endeavoured to
assign a reason for so mysterum** a conduct,
but in vain. Notwithstanding this, his belief
of it strengthened, and lie entered the abbey
under as full a conviction as the circumstance**
would admit of, that h was bis father who
had appeared in the sepulchre. On entering
what was now used as a parlour, he was much
surprised to find him quietly seated there
with Madame La Motte and Adeline, and con-
versing as if lie had been returned some time.
He took the first opportunity «f acquaint-
ing his mother with his late adventure, ami
of inquiring how long La Motte hud been
returned befun: him; when, learning that it
was near half an hour, his surprise increased,
and lie knew not what to conclude.
Meanwhile, a perception of the growing
partiality of Louis co-operated with the canker
of suspicion to destroy in Madame La Motte
that affection which pity arid esteem, bad'
formerly excited for Adeline. Her unkind*
ness was now too obvious to escape the uotico
of her to whom it was directed, and, being
noticed, it occasioned an anguish which Ade-
line found it very difficult to endure. With,
the warmth and candour of youth, she Koygbt

La Motte artfully evaded; while at the game
time she threw out bints that involved Adeline

present affliction more intolerable.
I have lost that affection, she'would say,

Thus distressed, she would frequently IcMyc.

would yield to a despondamcy which the had
never known1 till now. ''
One morning, 'being unable to • slop,, she
arose at a very early hour. The faint light
of day now trembled through'the clouds, And
gradually spreading from the horizon, an-
nounced the rising sun* Every feature of the
landseap e was slowly unveiled, moist with
the dews of night attd brightening with the
dawn, "till at length the sun appeared and
shed the Ml food of day., *rfie beauty of
the 'hoar invited her to walk, and she went
forth into the forest to taste the sweets of
morning. , The enrol* of new-waked birds
sainted her im she passed,' and the fresh gale
came scented with' :the breath of flowers,
whose tints flowed more vivid through the
dew drops that hung on their leaves.
She wandered on without noticing the dis-
tance, and, following the windings of the
rfter, came to a dewy glade, whose woods'}
sweeping down to the very edge of the water,
formed a scene so sweetly romantic, that she
sealed herself at the foot of a tree, to con-
template its beauty. These images insen-
sibly soothed her sorrow, and inspired her
with that soft and pleasing melancholy so
dear to the feeling mind.. For some time she
saf lost in a' reverie, while the flowers that
grew1 on the banks beside her seemed to smile
in,new life, and drew from her a comparison
with her own condition. She mused and
sighed, and then, in a voice whose charming
melody was modulated by the tenderness of
her heart, the sung the following words:
S0NHBT,
TO THE LILT.

A distant .echo lengthened out her tenet,
and the sat listening to the soft response, till
repeating the last stanza of the sonnet she
was - anawered by a voice almost as' tender,
and less distant. She looked round in sur-
prise, and" saw a young man in a hunter's
dress leaning against a tee, and gazing on
her with that deep attention which marks m
enraptured mind.
A thousand" apprehensions shot athwart
her busy'thought; and she now first remem-
bered her distance from the abbey. Site rose
in haste to be gone, when the stranger re-
spectfully advanced; but, observing her timid
looks and retiring steps, he paused. She
pursued her way towards the abbey; and
though toiany reasons made her anxious to
know whether she was followed, delicacy
forbade her to loot back. When she reached
the' abbey, finding the family was not vet
assembled to breakfast, she retired to her
chamber, wheie her whole thoughts were
employed in conjectures concerning the stran-
ger. Believing that she was interested on
this point no further than as it concerned the
safety of La Motte, she indulged without
scruple Lhe remembrance of that dignified air
and manner which so much distinguished the
youth she had seen. Alter revolving the cir-
cumstance more deeply, she believed it im-
fossible that a person of life appearance should
e engaged in a stratagem to betray a fellow*
creature; and though she was destitute of a
single circumstance that might assist her sur-
mises of who he was, or what was'hia busi-
ness in an unfrequented forest, she rejected,
unconsciously, every suspicion injurious to his
character, upon further deliberation, there-
fore, she resolved not to mention this little
circumstance to La Motte; well knowing,
that though his dang« might be imaginary.
his apprehensions would be -real, and would
renew all the '"sufferings and perplexity from
which he was but just released* She resolved,
however, to refrain, for -some time walking
in the forest.
When she catue down to breakfast, slie
obterved Madame La Motte to be more than
usually reserved,' La Motte entered the room
soon after her,' and made some trifling obser-
vations on the weather; and, having endea-
voured to support an effort at cheerfulness,
sunk into hfe usual melancholy. Adellna
watched the countenance of Madame with
anxiety; and when there appeared in it a
gleam of kindness, it was as sunshine to her
soul j but she very- seldom suffered Adeline
thus to latter herself. ' Her conversation was
restrained, »nd; ©flea pointed at something
more than could be understood. The entrance
of Louis was a very seasonable relief to
Adeline, who almost feared to trust her voice
with a sentence, lest itl trembling accents
should betray her uneasiness.
This charming morning drew you early
from your chamber? said Louis, addressing
Adeline. You had, no doubt, a pleasant
companion too t said Madame La Motte, a
solitary walk is seldom agreeable.
1 was alone, Madam, replied Adeline.
 
 
 
t$
 
 
Indeed ! your ovn thoughts must be highly
pleasing then.
Alas"! returned Adeline, a tear spile of
Ift-r efforts starting tQ her eye, Uicre are now
few subjects of pleasure left for thenn
That is very surprising, pursued Madame
La Motte.
1$ it, indeed, surprising, Madam, for those
who have lost their last friend to be unhappy?
Madame La Blotters conscience acknow-
ledged the rebuke, and she blushed.
Well, resumed she, after a short pause,
that Is not your situation, Adeline, looking
earnestly at La Motte. Adeline, whose, in-
nocence protected her from suspicion, did
not regard this circumstance; but, smiling
through her tears, said, she rejoiced to hear
her say so. During this conversation, La
Motte had remained absorbed in his own
thoughts; anil Louis, unable to guess at
what it pointed, looked alternately at his
mother and Adeline for an explanation. The
latter he regarded with an expression so full
of tender compassion, that it revealed at
mice to Madame La Motte the sentiments of
tits soul; and she immediately replied to the
last words of Adeline with a very serious air s
A friend m only estimable when our conduct
deserves one; the friendship that survives
the merit of its object is a disgrace, instead
of an honour, to both parties.
The maimer and emphasis with which she
delivered these words, again alarmed Adeline,
who mildly said, she hoped she should never
deserve such censure. Madame was silent;
but Adeline was so much shocked by what
had already parsed, that tears sprurg from
her eyes, and she hid her fact* with her hand-
kerchief.
Louis now rose with some emotion; and
La Motte, roused from his reverie, inquired
what was the matter: but before he could
receive an answer he seemed to have forgotten
that he had asked the question. Adeline
may give you her own account, said Madame
Im Motte, I have not deserved this, said
Adeline rising; but since my presence is
dtapfeasing, I'will retire.
She moved towards the door; when Louis,
who was pacing the room in apparent agita-
turn, gently took her band, laying, Here is
some unhappy rnjatake*-.and would have led
her to the seat s but her spirite were too much
depressed, to endure longer restraint; and,
withdrawing her hand, Suffer me to go, said
she 5 if there is any mistake, 1 am unable to
explain it, Saying this, she quitted the room,
Xjonis followed her with his eyes to the imt;
when turning to his mother, purely, Madam,
said he, -you are to'blame: my life on it she
ctaierra you* warmest tettderties*. •
You are very eloquent in her cause, Sir,
said Madame, may 1 presume to a*k what
interested you thus in her favour
Her own amiable mannas, .rejoined Jjouia,
which no wns can observe without esteeming
them*
But you may presume too much on your
own observations; it is possible these amiable
manners may deceive you.
Your pardon Madam; I may, without pre*
sumption, affirm they cannot deceive me.
You luwe, no doubt, good reasons for thta
assertion, and 1 perceive, by your admiration
of this artless innocence* she has succeeded.
In her design of entrapping your heart.
Without designing it, she.ha* won my
admiration, which would not have been the
awe, had she been capable of the condmct
you mention.
Madame La Motte was going to reply, but
was prevented by her husband, who, again
roused from his reverie, inquired into' the
cause of dispute. Away with this ridiculous)
behaviour, said he in a voice of displeasure;
Adeline has omitted some household duty, 1
suppose; and an offence m heinous deserves,
severe puuisdnuent, no doubt: but let me be
no more disturbed with your petty quarrels;
if you must be tyrannical, Madam, indulge
your humour in private.
Saying this, be abruptly quitted the room f
and Louis juuuediately following, Madame
was left to her own unpleasant reflection**
Her ilLhunmur proceeded from the usual
cause* She had heard of Adeline's watfc'l
and JUi Motte having gone forth into the
forest at an early hour, her imagination,
heated by the broodings of jealousy, suggested
that they had appointed a tweeting. Thii
was confirmed to her by the entrance of Ade-
line, quickly followed by I* Motte ; and her
perceptions thus iaundiced by passion, neither
the presence of her son, nor her usual atten-
tion to cood monnersi bad been able to
restrain fief emotions. The behaviour of
Adeline In the late scene she considered at a
refined piece of art, and the indifiwtos 0
 La Motte as affected. So true is it that

When her first agitation* wefe subsided, sftc

herself, she become more iatfcfied^ deriving

Adeline passed the - greatest < part of the
day alone in her chamber,'-. where* -.haviiu:
examined her conduct, she endeavoured to
fortify her heart - against the unmerited dis-
pleasure of Madame La, Motte. . This. w«s a
task,more difficult than -that -of 'seif*acquit-
tance. She loved her, and had reliction her
friendship, which, notwithstanding the con-
duct of Madame, still appeared 'Valuable to
her* It was true, she had' riot .desetved to
lose it; but Madarne.was so averse to ex-
planation, that there was little probability of
recovering it, however ill-founded might be
the cause-of her dislike •• At 'length7she
reasoned, m tether' perhaps'persuaded her-
self into tolerable, composure;, fbr to ..'resign

thus repaying unkindness, which was suitable
to her own temper, her sentiments, and her
©ride. Self-love may  ht the centre found
which the human affections move; for what-
ever motive conduces to self-gratification may
he resolved into self-love; yet some of these
affections are in their nature mi refined, that
though we' cannot  deny their origin, they
almost deserve the name of virtue, CM" this
species was that of Adeline.
In this employment, mi in reading, Ade-
line passed ms much of the day as possible.
From bookie indeed, she had constantly de-
rived her chief information aid amusement;
those belonging to La Motte were few, hut
well chosen; and Adeline could find pleasure
In reading them more than onca When her
mind was discomposed by the behaviour of
Madame La Motte, or by a retrospection of
her early misfortunes, a book was the opiate
that lulled it to repose. La Motte had neve-
ral of the best English poets, a language
which Adeline had learned in the convent;
their beauties, therefore, she was capable of
tasting, and they often inspired her with en- .
tbusiastic'delight.
At the decline of d»j she quitted her chum-
bet to enjoy the sweet evening hour, but
strayed no farther than an avenue near the
abbey, which fronted the west. Khc read a
little; but finding it impossible any longer to
abstract her attention from the scene around;
she closed' the book, and yielded to the sweet
complacent melancholy which the hour in-
spired* The air was still; the sun sinking
below the distent hill, spread a purple glow
over the landscape, and touched the forest
glades with softer light. A dewy freshness
was diffused upon the air. As .the sun de-
scended, the 'dusk came silently on^ and the
scene assumed a solemn grandeur. As she
roused, she recollected and repeated the fol-
lowing stanzas i

• Tlie sound oFseveral voices.succeeded, and'a

"had little doubt that the officers of justice had
at length discovered his retreat, and the per-
turbation of fear almost confounded his senses s
he, however, ordered the lights to be .extin-
guished, and a profound gilence to be observed,
unwilling to neglect even the slightest possi-
bility of security. There was a chance, he
thought, that the persons might suppose the
place,uninhabited, and believe they had mis-
token the object of their search* His orders
.were, scarcely obeyed, when the knocking was
renewed,, and with, increased violence. La
'Motto, now repaired to a small grated window
in the portal of the gate, that he might observe
the number and appearance'of the .strangers.
'-The, darkness of .the night baffled his pur-
. pose, he could only perceive a giroq* of men

Once, in the paufef of the wind, he thought

left to conjecture," for the renewed knocking
at the gate, again appalled' him; and regard-
'less of the terrors of Madame La Motte and
Adeline, he ran to try his last chance of con-
cealment by means of the trap-door.
'Soon after, the violence of the assailants
seeming .to increase with every gust of the
tempest, the gate," which was old and decayed,
fcurst from its hinges, and admitted them to
the halt ;At the moment of their entrance,
a scream' from'Madame La Motte, who stood
at the door of an' adjoining 'apartment, con-
firmed the suspicions ,of the principal stranger,
who continued to'advance at fest as the dark-
ness would permit him. •
Adeline had'fainted,-and- Madame La
Motte was calling loudly for assistance, when
Peter entered with lights, and discovered the
hall Med with men, and 'his young mistress
senseless''upon'the Moor.' A chevalier now
advanced, and,'soliciting pardon 'of Madame
for the rudeness of his conduct, was attempt-
ing an apology, when, perceiving Adeline, lie
'hastened to raise her from the ground; but
Louis, who now returned, caught her in his
'arms, and desired the stranger not td interfere.
The' person to whom he spoke this, wore
the star of one of the first orders in France,
and had an air of dignity which declared hi in
to be of superior rank He appeared to be
about forty, but perhaps the spirit and fire of
his countenance made the impression of time
upon his features' less perceptible. ' His soft-
ened aspect and insinuating manners,1 while,
regardless of himself, he seemed- attentive
only to the condition of Adeline, gradually
dissipated the apprehensions Of Madame La
Motte, and subdued the sudden' resentment
of Louis. Upon Adeline, who wa* yet ^ in-
sensible, he gazed with an eager admiration,
which seemed to absorb aft the faculties of
his mind. She was' indeed an object tnot to
be contemplafed with indifference*
Her beauty, touched with the Ittfygttid'de-
licacy of illness, gained from sentiment what
it lost in bloom. The negligence -of' her
dress, loosened for the 'purpose' of' free* respi-
ration, discovered'- those gldwing fehaftns,
 which her auburn tresses, that fett in profu-
sion over her bosom, shaded, but" could' not
conceal.
There 'now entered ' another stranger, a
young chevalier, who' having spoke'nastlfy to
the elder, joined the genefal'- group that sur-
'rounded Adeline. He was  of "a p&tmMm
which elegance was ;happiy blended • with
strength, and' had a countenance animated,
but''not haughty;-noble* yet exprwslvt of
"peculiar" sweetness. -Wh«;"rerMe»d' it at

On perceiving htm, a blush of quick sur*
prise paascd over her cheek, for she knew
hip*- to be the stranger she had seen in the
forest. ' Her countenance instantly 'changed
to the paleness of-fterror when she observed
tlie room crowded with people. Louis How
supported her i into another apartment, where
the two chevaliers, who followed', her, again
Apologized for the alarm they had occasioned.
The elder, turning to Madame L» Mottc,
said, Vou are, no doubt, Madam, ignorant
lliat 1 am the proprietor of this abbey. She
started. Be not alarmed,. Madam, yon are
gate and welcome. This .ruinous spot has
been long abandoned by me, and if it has
afforded ydu a shelter I am happy. Madame
La Motto expressed her gratitude for this cop-
ctescentaoa, and Louis declared his sense of
the politeness of the Marquis de Mpntalt, for
that was the name of the noble stranger.
My chief residence, said the Marquis, is in
a distant province, but 1 have a chateau near
the, borders of the forest, and in returning
from an excursion 1 have been benighted and
lost my way. A, light which gleamed through
the trees .attracted me hither; and such was
the darkness without, that I did not know it
proceeded from the abbey till I came to the
door. The noble deportment of the strangers,
the splendour of their apparel, and above all,
this speech dissipated every remaining doubt
of Madame's, and she was giving orders for
refreshments to be set before them, when La
Motte, who .had listened, and was now con-
vinced lie had nothing to fear, entered the
apartment.
He advanced towards the Marquis with a
complacent air; but as he would have spoke,
th* words of welcome faultercd on his lips,
his limbs trembled, and a ghastly paleness
overspread his countenance.
The Marquis was little less agitated, and
m the- first moment of surprise put his hand
upon Ilia,sword; but recollecting himself, he
withdrew it, and endeavoured to obtain a
. i^mmand-of features*' A pause of agonizing,
 silence ensued* , La ftfottc made some motion
'towards  the door, but his'agitated frame-re*
.frisqi to/support him, .and he sunk into a
."4pSr, filent arid. exhausted. , The horror of
hip .countenance, together, with his whole be-
ha&our,., excited the utmost surprise in Ma-
dame, whose eyes inquired of the 'Marquis
more than he; thought proper to answer; his
look increased instead of explaining tbe.mys-
, tcry^ and, expressed a mixture of emotions
which the-.cop Id not analyze. 'Meanwhile
. #he endeavoured to, soothe and revive her bus*
band-;- -but he .repressed h^r' efforts, .and,

La.Motte took a light and M the. Marquis
to a small room in a remote part of the efffftee,
where they remained near an hour. Madame,
alarmed by the length of their absence,'itfent
in quest of them; as she, dttrw near, n isw-

justifiable, prompted her to listen. ,La'M<>f.te

tion. The determined air with which he
spoke this,' while his countenance was over-
spread with a livid hue, made his wife shud-'
der; and she forbore all reply.
Madame La Motte retired to bed* but not
to rest. She ruminated on the past occur-
rence; and her surprise'and curiosity ;con* 
. ceming . the word* and behaviour - of her
husband were but more strongly stimulated
"by 'reflection. One truth, however, appeared; - .
she could not doubt but the myste?iouS' con-
duct'of La Motte, which had for so many
: months oppressed her with anxiety, and the
late scene with the' Marquis, originated from;
; the same'cause. This belief, which-seemed
to prove' how unjustly she had suspected 
Adeline, brought with it a 'pang of self,
accusation. She looked forward to the 'mor-
row, which would lead the Marquis again to
the abbey, with impatience. Wearied nature
at length resumed her rights, and yielded a-/
short oblivion of care.
At a late hour the next day the family.:
assembled to breakfast* Each individual of -
the party appeared silent and abstracted; but.
very different was the aspect of their fea-
tures, and still more the complexion of their'
thoughts. La Motte seemed agitated by
impatient fear, yet the sullenness of despair
overspread his countenance; a certain wild-
ness in his eye at times expressed the sudden;
start'of horror, and again his features would
sink into the'gloom of despondency. . # .-
Madame La Motte seemed harassed with
anxiety; she watched every turn of bet
husband's ' countenance, and impatiently
awaited the arrival of the Marquis.-  Louis
was composed and thoughtful. Adeline
seemed to feel her full share of uneasiness;
she had observed the behaviour of La Motte
Ac preceding night with much surprise, and
the nappy' confidence she had hitherto - re-
posed in him was shaken. 'She feared also, lest
the exigency of his circumstances should pre-
cipitate him again into the world, and that
.he would'be either unable or unwilling Jo
afford her a shelter beneath 'his roof.
During breaMist La Motte frequently fuse

the cause 'of his impatience, and endeavoured

After" breakfast, as Jit; waked upon the
lawn, Jxmis would have joined him, but La
Motte peremptorily declared he imejided to
he along $, and soon after, the'Marqui*' having
not yet arrived, proceeded to a greater distance
from the abbey. , , .
Adeline retired Into their usual working
room-with Madame La Motte, who ailed «!
nil air of cheerfulness 'and' even of ktadhrsM,
Feeling .the necessity of offering some reason
for the striking agitation of La Motte, and
of preventing, the'surprise, which the unex-
pected appearance of 'the Margin* 'Would
occasion Adeline, if she was left to connect it
with his behaviour of the preceding night?
she mentioned that .the'Marquis and La
Motte had long been known to each other,
arid that 'this unexpected meeting, after an
absence of many years, and under circum-
stances so altered and humiliating on, the
part of the latter, had occasioned nim. much
painful emotion. This had been heightened
by a .consciousness, that the Marquis had
formerly misinterpreted some circumstances,
in his conduct towards him, which had caused
a mi ^pension of their intimacy.
This account did not bring conviction to
the mind of Adeline, for it seemed"inadequate
to the degree of emotion which the Marquis
and la. Motte had mutually betrayed. ^ Ilet
surprise was excited,, and her curiosity
awakened by the words, which were meant to
deltide them both. But she forbore to express
her thoughts. . • ,
Madame proceeding with h^r plan, said,,
the Marquis was now expected, and' she
hoped whatever differences remained would be
perfectly adjusted. Adeline blushed,'and
endeavouring to reply, her lips faltered.
Conscious of this agitation,, and of the db-
sort ance of -Madame La Motte, her confusion
increased, and her, endeavours, to suppress
served only to heighten, it. JStill she tried
to renew the discourse, and still she found it
impossible to collect her thoughts. Shocked
lest'Madame should apprehend the sentiment
which had till this moment been concealed
almost, from herself, her colour fled, she
fixed her eyes on the ground, and for mine
time fmmi it difficult to respire, 'Madame
I* Motte inquired if she was ill; when
Adeline, glad of the excuse, withdrew to the
indulgence of her own thoughts, which were
now wholly engrossed by the expectation of
teeing again the young chevalier who had
Aceomp&tiied'the Marquis*

it: I am now obliged' to tell you, 1 care not
how soon yew depart, if 1 am to be sub.
jected to these inquiries. La Motte walked
abruptly awny, and left his son to .doubt
and concern.
The arrival of the. Marquis had dissipated
the jealous fears of Madame lm Motte, and
she awoke to a sense of her cruelty towards
Adeline. When she considered her, orphan
state—the uniform affection which had ap-
peared in her behaviour—the mildness and
patience with which she had borne her inju-
rious treatment, she, was shocked, and took
an early opportunity of renewing her former
kindness. But she could, not explain this
seeming, inconsistency of conduct, without
betraying her late suspicions, which she now
blushed to remember, nor could she apologize
for her former behaviour, without giving
tliis explanation.
, She contented herself, therefore, with ex-
pressing in her manner the regard which was
thus revived. Adeline was at first surprised,
but she felt too much pleasure at the change
to be scrupulous in inquiring its cause.
But notwithstanding the satisfaction which
Adeline received from the revival of Madame
La Motte*s kindness, her thoughts frequently
recurred to the peculiar and forlorn circum-
stances of her condition. She could not help
feeling less confidence than she had formerly
done in the friendship of Madame La Motte,
whose character now appeared less amiable
than her imagination had represented it, and
seemed strongly tinctured with caprice. Her
thoughts often dwelt, upon, the strange intro-
duction of the Marquis at the abhey, and on
the mutual emotions and apparent dislike of
.La Motte and himself; and under these cir-
cumstances, it equally excited her surprise
that La Motte should choose, and that the
Marquis should permit him, to remain in his
territory*
Her mind returned the oftener, perhaps,
to this subject, because it was connected
with Theodore; but it returned unconscious
of the idea which attracted it. She attri-
'buted the interest she felt in the affair to her
anxiety for the welfare of La Motte, and for
her own future destination, which was now
*o deeply involved in his. Sometimes, in-
deed, she caught, herself busy in conjecture
as to the degree of relationship in, which
Theodore stood to the Marquis; but she im-
mediately checked her thoughts, and, severely
blamed herself for having miffered them to
, stray to an object which she perceived was
too dangerous to her peace.

Are less than horriblt iraagiulnga> 
A fKW clays after flic occurrence plated In
the preceding chapter, as Adeline was alone
in her chamber, she was roused from a reverie
by a trampling of horses' near the gate; and
on looking from the casement' she iaw the
Marquis oe Montalt enter the abbey. This
circumstance surprised her, and an emotion,
whose cause 'she did not trouble herself to
inquire for, made her instantly retreat from
the window^ The same cause, however, led
her thither again as hastily | but the object
of her search did not appear, and she was in
no hatte to retire.
As she stood rousing and disappointed, the
Marquis came out with La Motte, and imme-
diately looking up, saw Adeline and bowed.
She returned his compliment respectfully,
and withdrew from the window, vexed at
having been seen there. They went into the
forest, but the Mafquis'fl attendants did not,
as before, follow ifeern thither. When thuy
returned, which was not till after a consider-
able time, the Marquis immediately mounted
his horse and rode away.
For the remainder of the day La Motte
appeared gloomy and silent, and was fre-
quently lost in thought. Adeline observed
him with particular attention and concern:
she perceived that he was always more me*
lancholy after an interview with the Marquis,
and was now surprised to hear that the latter
bad'appointed to dine the next day at ihe
abbey.
When I/a Motte mentioned this, he added
some high eulogiums'on the character of the
Marquis,. and particularly praised his gene-
rosity and nobleness of soul. At this Instant,
Adeline recollected the anecdotes she had for-
merly heard concerning the abbey, and they
threw a shadow over the brightness of that ex-
cellence which La,Motte now celebrated. The
account, however, did not appear to deserve
much credit; a part of it, as far as a nega-
tive will admit of demonstration, having been
already proved false; fm It had been re-
ported that the abbey was haunted, and no
supernatural appearance had ever been ob-
served by the present inhabitants.
Adeline,' however, Ventured to inquire
whether it was the present Marquis of whom
those injurious reports had been raised? La
Motte answered her with a smile of ridicule:
Stories of ghosts and hobgoblins have always
been admired and cherished by the vulgar,
said he; I am inclined to rely upon my own
experience, at least as much as upon' the
accounts of these peasant!; if you have seen
any thing to corroborate these accounts, pray
inform me of li,~"f3iai I may establish my
faith.

 and blushed to find now much he engaged

sunshine of Adeline's mind was clouded,
though she was able to wear her usual air
of cheerfulness. The Marquis was polite,
affable, and attentive: to manners tile most
easy and elegant, was added the fast, reftac*
ment of polished life. II is converj^U<fri/w»*

undergoing some repairs, which make if but
nil uncomfortable residence.
* The Vivacity of lm Motte disappeared with
ot« guest, and tie- stton relapsed into fits of
silence and abstraction.  The Blarquis is a
very agreeable man, said Madame La Motte.
Very agreeable, replied he. And seems to
have an excellent heart, she resumed. An
excellent one, said ija Motte.
You seem discomposed, my dear; what
ha* disturbed you?
, Not 'in the least—I was only thinking,
that with such 'agreeable' talents and such an
excellent'heart, it was a pity the Marquis
should—'
What ?' my dear, sale! Matlsme with im-
patience. That the Marquis should—should
suffer 'this -abbey to fall into rains, replied
tm Motte.
'Is that all? said Madame with disappoint-
trtent.—That is all, upon my honour, said
Ik'Motte, -and left the roam.
Adeline's spirits, no longer supported by
the animated conversation of the Marquis,
Stink into languor, and when he departed she
ifalked' pensively into the forest. She fol-
lowed a little romantic path that wound along
the margin of the stream and was overhung
with deep shades. The tranquillity of the
scenes which' autumn now touched with her
Sweetest tints, softened her mind to a tender
kind'of melancholy; and she suffered a tear,
Hrhich she knew not wherefore had stolen into
her eye, to tremble there unchecked. She
came to a, little lonely recess formed by high
tree*';'the wind sighed mournfully among
the branches, and as it waved their lofty
huadi ftcattered their leaves to. the ground.
She seated herself on a bank beneath,, and
indulged the melancholy reflections that
pressed on her mind*
O! could I dive into futurity and, behold
the events which .await me! said, she ;, 1
should perhaps, by constant contemplation,
be enabled to meet them with fortitude. An
orphan in this wide world—thrown upon the,
friendship of strangers for comfort, and upon
their bounty for the -cry means of existence,
what but evil have I to expect? Alas, .my
father! how could you thus abandon your
child—how leave her to the storms _ of life—,
to sink, perhaps, beneath . them? alas, 1
have no friend! ....'.•
She-was'interrupted by a rustling among
the. fallen leaves; she turned her head, arid
perceiving the Marquis's young friend, arose
to depart. Pardon this intrusion, said, he,
your voice fattraeted me hither, and your
words detained me: my offence, however?
brings with it its own punishment; hating
learned your sorrows-—how can I. help feeling
them myself? would, that my sympathy or
my suffering could rescue you from them !—
He hesitated.—Would that I could deserve
the title of your friend, and be 'thought
worthy of it by yourself!
The confusion of Adeline's thoughts could
scarcely permit her to reply; she trembled,
and, gently withdrew her hand, which he had
taken while he spoke. You have perhaps
heard, Sir, more than is true: I am indeed
not happy; but a moment of dejection has
made me unjust, and I am less unfortunate
than 1 have represented. When I Haiti 1

He looked as if his mind was labouring with
something which he was unwilling to express.
But you "know not how delicately lam cir-
curmtaneed, continued ho t yet I. will aver
that my questions are prompted by the ten-
derest interest in your happiness—and even
by my fears for your safety, Adeline started.
I fear you are deceived, said he, I fear there's
danger near you.
Adeline stopped, and looking earnestly at
him, begged he would explain himself. She
suspected that, some mischief threatened La
Mottc; and Theodore continuing; silent, she
repeated her request. If La IMotte is con-
cerned in this danger, said she. let me entreat
you to acquaint him with .it immediately;
he has hut too many misfortunes to appre-
hend.
Excellent Adeline! cried Theodore, that

you. Mow shall I hint what I fear is too
true, and how forbear to warn you of yonr
danger without—He was interrupted by a
Ftep among the trees, ami presently after saw

charnhr/r. She runiinnted upon the words of
Theodore; and the more she considered them,
the more she was perplex-:, d. Sometimes she
blamed herself for having made an appoint-
ment, doubting whether he had not solicited
it tor the purpose of pleading a passion; and
now delicacy checked this thought, and made
her vexed that she had. presumed upon having
inspired one. She recollected the serious
earnestness of his voice and manner when he
entreated her to meet him; and as they con-
vinced her of the importance of the subject,
she shuddered at a danger which she could
not comprehend, looking forward to the mor-
row with anxious impatience.
Sometimes too a remembrance of the tender
interest he had expressed for her welfare, and
of his correspondent look and air, would steal
across her memory, awakening a pleasing
emotion and a latent hope that she was not
indifferent to him. From reflections like these
she was roused hy a summons to supper:—
the repast was a melancholy <mc, it being the
last evening of Louies stay at the abbey.
Adeline, who esteemed him, regretted his
departure, while his eyes were, often bent on
her with a look which seemed fo express that
he was about to leave the object of his affee-

tton. She endeavoured by her cheerfulness
to rMintmate the- whole party, and especially
Madame. I* Motte, who frequently shed
team. We shall soon meet again, said Ade-
Ym(%  I trust in happier circumstances, Jm

brightened'at her words. Bo you wish it*

tainly'l do, f$he replied: <^n you doubt my

I cannot doubt any thing that is good of

You forget .you have left- Paris, said La
Motte to his son* while a faint, smile crossed
his face; such a compliment would there he
in diameter with the place—in these solitary
woods1- it is quite outre.
The language of admiration is not always
that of compliment, Sir, said Louie. Adeline,
willing to'Change the discourse, asked to what
part of France he was going, lie replied that
his regiment was now at Peronne, and he
should' go immediately thither. After some
mention of indifferent subjects, the family
withdrew for the night to their several
chambers*
The approaching departure of her son
occupied the thoughts of Madame La Motte,
and' she appeared at breakfast with eyes
swoln with weeping. The pale countenance
of Louis seemed to indicate that he had rested
no -better than his mother. When breakfast
was over, Adeline retired for a while, that she
might not interrupt by her presence their last
conversation. As she walked on the lawn
lefoffe the" abbey, she returned in thought to
the'Weurtenccofyestertlay evening, and her
'Impatience for the appointed interview in-
Creased." She was soon joined by Louis. It
"Was unkind of you to leave us, said he, in the

<©T pttstfoii, and he told what'Adeline every
J moment feared to h«ar.'
''This 'declaration,- said Adeline, endeavour-
!ng'tb overcome' the agitation it'excited, gives
;,rne ine^essible concern*
'' 'O, 'say hot 'so -! interrupted Louis, but give
'rnte tome1' slender 'hope' -to supper t me .in the

outrun them all: and suffer me to lvope for a
sentiment less cool than that of friendship, as
well m to believe that t do "not owe your
approbation of me to the actions of others.
1 have long borne my passion in silence,'
because 1 foresaw the difficulties that would-
attend it; nay, 1 have even dared to endea-
vour to overcome it: I have dared to believe
it possible—forgive the supposition, that I
could forget you—and——^
You distress me, interrupted Adeline; this
is a conversation which 1 ought not to hear.
1 am above disguise, and therefore assure you
that, though your virtues will always com.
mand my esteem, you have nothing to hope
from my love. Were it even otherwise, our
circumstances would effectually decide foT us.
If you are really my friend, you will rejoice
that I am spared this struggle between affec-
tion and prudence. Let me hope, also, that
time will teach vou to reduce love within the
limits of friendship.
Never, cried Louis vehemently; were this
possible, my passion would he unworthy of
its object. While he spoke, Adeline's favour-
ite fawn came bounding towards her. This
circumstance affected Louis even to tears.
This little animal, said he, after a short pause,
first conducted me to you: it was witness to
that happy moment when I first saw you
surrounded by attractions too powerful for
my heart; that moment is now fresh in my
memory, and the creature comes even to
witness this sad one of my departure. Grief
interrupted his utterance.
When he recovered his voice, he said,
Adeline! when you look upon your little
favourite and caress it, remember the unhappy
Louis, who will thon be far—far from you.
Do not deny me the, poor consolation of be-
lieving this!
I shall not require such a monitor ^ to
remind me of you, said Adeline with a smile;
your excellent parent* and your own merits
nave sufficient claim upon my remembrance.
Could I see your natural good sense.resume
its influence over passion,' my satisfaction
would equal my esteem for vbu, ,. ' ,
Do not hope it, said "Louis, nor will I wish
it; for passion here is virtue. - As'he spoke
he taw La Motte turning round an angle of
the abbey. The moments are precious, said
be, I am interrupted. O! Adeline, farewell!
and say that you will sometimes think of roe.
'• . .Farewell, said Adeline, who was affected by
his distress—farewell!' and  peace attend y<ro«
I wijl think of you with' the affection of a
sister.—He sighed deeply, and pressed per
. hand; when La Motte, winding round another
projection of the ruin, again appeared- .Age-

his unhappy attachment. Stic remained in
her chamber till 'he had quitted the abbey,
unwilling to subject him or herself to the
patn of a formal parting.
As evening and the hour of appointment
drew nigh, Adeline** impatience increased;
yet when the time arrived, her resolution
failed, and she faltered from her purpose.
There was something of indelicacy and dissi-
mulation in an apjunnted interview on Iter
part, that shocked her. She recollected the
tenderness of Theodore*s manner, and several
little circumstances which seemed to indicate
that his'heart was not unconcerned in the
event. Again she was inclined to doubt
whether lie had not obtained her consent to
this meeting upon some groundless suspicion;
and she almost determined not to go: yet it
was possible Theodore's assertion might be
sincere, and her danger real; the chance of
this made her delicate scruples appear ridi-
culous; she wondered that she had fm a
moment suffered thein to weigh against so
serious an interest, and blaming herself for
the delay they had occasioned, hastened to
the place of appointment.
Th'j little path which led to this spot, was
silent and Military, and when she reached the
recess Theodore had not arrived, A transient
pride made her unwilling he should find that
ahc was more punctual to his appointment
than himself | and nhe turned from the recess
into a track which wound among the trees to
the right. Having walked some way without
feeing any person vr hearing a footstep, she
returned; but he was not come, and she
again left the place, A second time she
came back, and Theodore was still absent*
Recollecting the time at which she had quit-
ted the abbey, she grew uneasy, and calcu-
lated that the hour appointed was now much
exceeded. She was offended and perplexed;
but she seated herself on the turf, and was
resolved to wait the event. After remaining
here till the fall of twilight in fruitless ex.
pectatlon, her pride became more alarmed;
she feared that he had discovered something
of the partiality he had Inspired; and be-
lieving that he now treated her with purposed
. neglect, the quitted the place with disgust
and ielf-accusation.
When these emotions iubsided,and reason
resumed its influence, she blushed for what
she termed this childish effervescence of self-
love. She recollected, as if for the first time,
these words of Theodore s I fear you are de-
ceived, and that some danger is near you.
Her Judgment now acquitted the offender,
and she' saw, only the friend. The import
< of these words, whose truth she no longer
. doubted, again alarmed her. Why did he
trouble'himself to come from the chateau, on
''pnroose to hint her danger, If he did 'lot
wlih to preserve her? And if he wished to
preserve her, what but necessity cottbl have
withheld him from the appointment?
These reflections decided her at once, ftbe
resolved to repair on the following day at cite
same hour to the recess, whither the interest
which she believed him to lake in her faus
would no doubt conduct hiinin th#'hope#C
meeting her. That mmt evil hovered over
her she could not disbelieve, but- what it
might be she was unable to guess. Monsieur
and Madame l-*a Muttc were her fricftd*, and.
who else, removed as she now thong lit 'her-
self, beyond the reach of her father, ecwtil
injure her? But why did Theodore my she
was deceived? 'She found it-impossible to,
extricate herself from the labyrinth of .con-
jecture, but endeavoured to command her
anxiety till the following evening. In the
mean time she engaged herself in efforts t&
amuse Madame La Mottc, who required
some relief after the departure of her son.
Tims oppressed by he? own cares and
interested by those of Madame La Mottc,
Adeline retired to rest, She won lost luer
recollection; hut it was only to fall into
harassed slumbers, such as but .too often
haunt the couch of the unhappy. At length
her perturbed fancy suggested .the following
dream.  . .. .
She thought she was in a large  old .cham*
be? belonging to the abbey, more ancient and
desolate, though in part furnished, than any
she had yet teen. It was itrongly banrica*
cloed, yet no person appeared, while aha
stood musing and iwrveyteg the apartment^
she heard a low voice call her; and looking
towards the place whence it came, she, per-
ceived by the dim light of a lunp a figure
stretched on a bed that lay on the, ffoor*- The
voice called again; and approaching the bed,
she distinctly saw the features .-of. a roan
who appeared to he dying. A-ghastly-palt*
ness overspread his countenance, yet -th«
was an expression &( mildness and dignity, in
it, which strongly interested her* , -
While she looked on him hi* featuwss
changed, and seemed convulsed in the agcf&jtai
of death. The tpectacie shocked her,. anjl
she started b?-ck; but he suddetdy s$ratcba4
forth 'his hand,, and tewing. ten, gwipd it

lengthy hweTerf fte "composed herself to
sleep 5 again she fell into a dream,
wit thought she was bewildered in some
winding pasmgei of the abbey % that it was .
almost dark, and' that she wandered about a
considerable time without being able to find
a flow." Suddenly she heard a bell toll from
above,- and soon after m confusion of distant
voices.- She redoubled her efforts to extricate
hersehV Presently all was still;' and at
length wearied with the search, she sat down
on a' step that crossed the passage. She had
not been icing hare when she saw a light glim-
mer at a distance on the walls; but a turn in
the passage, which was very long, prevented
her seeing from what it proceeded* It con-
tinued to .glimmer faintly for some time and
then grew stronger, when she saw a man
enter the passage habited  in - a long Hack
clp&k like those usually worn by attendants
at funerals, and bearing a torch. He called
to her to follow him, and led her through a
long passage to the foot of a staircase. Mere
she feared to proceed, and was running back,
when the man suddenly turned to pursue her,
and with the terror which this occasioned she
awoke.
'Shocked by these visions, and more so by
their seeming connection, which now struck
her, she endeavoured to continue awake, lest
their terrific images should again haunt her
mind; after some time, however, her har-
aiied spirits again stink into slumber, though
not to repose,
She now thought herself to a large old
gallery, and saw at one end of it a chamber
door standing a little open and a light within j
she went towards  it, and perceived the man
she had before seen, standing at the door and
beckoning her  towards him. ' With the in-
consistency «o common In dreams, she no
l#ngef eiia€«voured to avoid him, butadvanc*
ing,' followed him into a suit of very ancient
apartments hung with black and lighted up
at'If for a funeral. 'Still he led her .on,' till
she found herself in the 'same chamber she 
rfsnetnbefed to have seen in her former dream:
* coffin-covered with a "pall stood-at the fur-
ther end of -the room; some lights and seve-
ral persons surrounded it, who appeared to be
ili great distress,
. Suddenly she thought these persons were
all  gone*- and that she was left alone; that
she #ent up to the coffin, and while she
ga»d upon it, she heard a voice speak, as if
front within, but saw nobody. The man she
had 'before wen, soon after stood by the coffin,
and lifting the pall, she saw beneath it a
diaA'parson, whom she thought to be the
dying chevalier she had seen in her former
diemin | his-features were sunk in death, but
they-"»«»' yet serene, While she looked at
him, *'» sftreanftftf blood gushed from his side,
in!' '^tasMtogvWthe 6m the whole chant*
ber was overflowed; at Ae same time some-
words were uttered in a voice she heard he^
fore; but the horror of the scene so entirely
overcame her, that she started and awoke*
When she had recovered her recollection,
she raised herself in" the bed, to be convinced
it was a dream she had witnessed; and the
agitation of her spirits was so great, that she
feared to be alone, and almost determined to
call Annette. The features of the deceased
person, and the chamber where he lay, were
strongly impressed upon her memory, arid
she still thought she heard the voice and saw
the countenance which her dream represented.
The longer she considered these dreams, the
inore she was surprised; they were so v«ry**
terrible, returned so often, and seemed to he
so connected with each other, that she could
scarcely think them accidental; yet why they
should be supernatural, she could not tell.
She slept no more that night.

JVLIV* C.-SsAR.
When Adeline appeared at breakfast, hot
harassed and languid countenance struck
Madame La Motte, who inquired if she was
ill. Adeline, forcing a smile upon her fea-
tures, said she had not rested well, for that
she had had very disturbed dreams;. she was
about to describe them, but a strong and in-
voluntary- impulse prevented 'her, . .At the
same time La Motte ridiculed her concern so
unmercifully, that she was almost ashamed
to have mentioned it, and tried to overcome
the remembrance of its cause*
After breakfast, she endeavoured to em-
ploy her thoughts by conversing with Ma-
dame La. Motte; but they were really engaged
by the incidents of the last two days, the
circumstance of her dreams, and her conjec-
tures concerning the information to be com-
municated to her by Theodore. They'had
thus sat for some time, when a sound of
voices arose from the great gate of the abbey;
and on going to the casement, Adeline saw
the/Marquis and his attendants on the lawn
below. The portal of the abbey concealed
.several people from her view, and among
these it was possible might be Theodore, who
had not yet appeared: she continuM to look
for him with great anxiety, till the "Marquis-
entered the haU with La Motte-and-seine
other nersonsi soon after which Madame went
to receive him, and Adeline-retired "to her
own apartment.
A message from La Motte, however, soon
called her-to join the party, - whem she .-vainly
hoped to find Theodore*. ;The Marquis i«ro*o
 
 
47
as ah* ftpjproaehed,' and, hairing paid her
some general compliments, the con vernation
took a very lively turn. Adeline, finding it
impossible to counterfeit cheerfulness while
her heart wan sinking with anxiety and dis-
appointment, took little part in it: Theodore
was not once named- She would have asked
concerning him, had it been possible to in-
quire with propriety; hat she was obliged to
content herself with hoping, first, that he
would arrive before dinner, and then before
the departure of the Marquis.
Thus the clay passed in expectation and
disappointment* The evening was now ap«
proaching* and she was condemned to re-
itiain in the presence of the Marquis, appa-
rently listening to a conversation which, in
truth, she scarcely heard, while the oppor*
Utility was perhaps escaping that would
decide her fate, She was suddenly relieved
from this state of torture, and thrown into
one, if possible, still more distressing.
The Marquis inquired for Louis, and
being informed of his departure, mentioned
that Theodore Peyrou had that morning set
out for his regiment in a distant province.
Ue lamented toe loss he should sustain by
his absence; and expressed some very flat-
tering praise of his talents. The shock of
this intelligence overpowered the long-agitated
spirits of Adeline: the blood forsook her
cheeks, and a sudden faintness came over
her, from which she recovered only to a con-
sciousness of having discovered her emotion,
and the danger of relapsing into a second
lit.
She retired to her chamber, where being
once more alone, her oppressed heart found
relief from tears, in which she freely in-
dulged* Ideas crowded so fast upon her
mind, that it was long ere she could arrange
them so as to produce any thing like reason-
ing. She endeavoured to account for the
abrupt departure of Theodore, Is it possible,
said she, that he should take an interest In
my welfare, and yet leave me exposed to the
full force of a danger which he himself fore-
saw? Or am I 'to believe that he has trifled
with my simplicity for an idle frolic, and
lias now left me.. to the wondering apprehen-
sion he has raised? Impossible I a counte-
nance so noble, and a manner so amiable,
eould never disguise a heart capable of
forming so detpicabie a design. Mo!*—
whatever is reserved for me, let roe not re-
linquish the pleasure of believing that he li
worthy- of my esteem.
. She.' was awakened from thought* like
these % a peal oi distant thunder, and now
perceived that the gloominess of evening was'
deepened by the coming storm; it rolled
onward, ami toon after tlie lightning began
to flush alow the chamber. Adeline Was.
superior «• .the" affectation of fear, and was
not apt to be terrified; but Ae w># felt it'
unpleasant to be alone, and hoping that the.'
Marquis might have left the ahby^ slit weal
down to the sitting-room: bat'the threaten*'
ing aspect of the. heavens had hitherto de*'
tained him, and now the evening tempest - 
made him rejoice that he had not quitted a
shelter. The storm continued,  and night
came on. La Motte pressed.<• his guest.to
take a bed at the wbbey, and he at length *-
consented; a circumstance which threw iain*. 
dame La Motte into some perplexity as. to'<
tlie accommodation to be albrded him. After
some time she arranged the affair to her sa». -
tisfaction; resigning her own apartment to
the Marquis, and that of Louis to two of hk
superior attendants; Adeline, it was further
settled, should give up her room to Monsieur'''
and Muclame La Motte, and to remove <o all
inner chamber, where a small bed, usually
occupied by Annette, was placed im her.
At supper tlie Marquis was less gay than
usual; lie frequently addressed Adeline, -and
his look and manner seemed to eiprcst^the -
tender interest which her indisposition, for
she still appeared pale and languid, had'ex-,
cited, Adeline, as usual, made an effort to,
forget her anxiety and appear happy t but
the veil of assumed cheerfulness was too,-
thin to conceal the features of sorrow; awl
her feeble §railes only added a peculiar  soft*' •
ncss to her air. The Marquis conversed with'
her on a variety of subject*, and displayed' mt -
elegant mind. The observations of Adeline, •
which, when called upon4 she gav6 with re-
luctant modesty, in words at once simple'.,
and forceful, seemed to excite his admiration^ 
which ho sometimes betrayed by an inadtef-
teat expression.  . :
Adeline retired early to her room, which
adjoined oa one side to Madame La MotteV, •
and on the other to the closet formerly ».©»•-
tioned* It wai spacious and lofty, -and what:
little furniture it contained was falling ."to,
decay ; but perhaps the present tone of her-
spirits might contribute moito than those cir-
cumstances to. give that air of melancholy'
which seemed to feign in it. She was na*'
willing to go to bed, lest the dreamt thai had'
lately pursued her should return; and.-de*'
termincd to sit tip till she found herself
oppressed by sleep, when it was probable her
rest • would be profound. She placed ... tiff,
light on a small table, and takisga.book,,.

THE ROMANCE OF THE FOREST.
 
 
the night and her own melancholy imoginn-
tmn conspired to raise. As she sat musing,
lie? eyes fixed on the opposite wall, she per-
ceived ihe arras, with which the room was
hung, wave backwards and forwards; «be
continued to observe it for some minutes,
and then rose to examine It further. It was
moved by the wind; and she Hushed at the
momentary fear it had excited; hut she ob-
served that the tapestry was more strongly
agitated in one particular place than else-
where, and a noise that seemed something
more than that of the wind issued thence. The
old bedstead, which La Motte had found in
this apartment, had been removed to ac-
commodate Adeline, and it was behind the
place where this had stood, that the wind
«eemed to rush with particular force; curiosity
prompted her to examine still further; she
felt about the tapestry, and perceiving the
wall behind shake under her hand, she lifted
the arras, and discovered a small door,
"whose loosened hinges admitted the wind,
and occasioned the noise she had heard*
, The door was held only by a bolt, having
undrawn which, and brought the light, she
descended by a few steps into another cham-
oer; she instantly remembered her dreams.
The chamber was not much like that In
which she had seen the dying chevalier, and
afterwards the bier; but it gave her a con-
fused remembrance of one through which she
had passed. Holding up the light to ex-
amine it more fully, she was convinced by
Its structure that it was part of the ancient
foundation* A shattered casement, placed
high from the floor, seemed to be the only
opening to admit light. She observed a
floor on the opposite side of the apartment;
and after some moments of hesitation gained
courage, and determined to pursue tie in-
quiry. A mystery seems to hang over these
chamberg, said she, which it is perhaps my
lot to develope; I will at least see to what
that door leads.
8he stepped forward, and having unclosed
it, proceeded with faltering steps along a
suite of apartments, resembling the first in
style and condition, and terminating in one
exactly like that where her dream had re-
presented the dying person; the remembrance
.struck so forcibly upon her imagination, that
ihe was in danger of fainting; and looking
yound the room, almost expected to see the
phantom of her dream.
Unable to quit the place, she sat down on
iome old lumber to recover herself, while her
spirits were nearly overcome by a sapersti-
4ous dread, such as she had never felt before*
She wandered to what part of the abbey these
chambers belonged, and that they had so
long escaped detection. The casements were
,9$ too high to afford any information from
vfthtot* Wktu she. win fttfficlcntly composed
to consider the direction of the robins and
the situation of the abbey, there appears!
not a doubt that they formed an interior part
of the original building.
As these reflections passed over her mind,
a sudden gleam of moonlight fell upon some
object without the casement. Being now
sufficiently composed to wish to pursue the
inquiry, and believing this object might
afford her some means of learning the situa-
tion of these rooms, she combated he? re-
maining terrors; and in order to distinguish
it more clearly, removed the light to an
outer chamber; but before she could return,
a heavy cloud was driven over the face of the
moon, and all without was perfectly dark;
she stood for some moments waiting a re-
turning gleam, but the obscurity continued.
As she went softly back for the light, her
foot stumbled over something on the floor;
and while she stooped to examine it, the
moon again shone, so that she could distin-
guish through the casement, the eastern
towers of the abbey. This discovery con-
firmed her former conjectures concerning the
Interior situation of these apartments. The
Obscurity of the place prevented her discover-
ing what. it was that had impeded her steps,
but having brought the light forward, she
perceived on the floor an old dagger: with a
trembling hand she took it up, and upon a
©loser view perceived that it was spotted and
stained with rust.
Shocked and suprised, she looked round
tile room for some object that might confirm
or destroy "the dreadful "suspicion which now
rushed upon her mind; hut she .saw only a
great chair with broken arms, that stood in
one corner of the room, and a table in a
condition equally shattered, except that in
another part lay a conftised heap of things,
which appeared to be old lumher. She went
'up to it, and perceived a broken bedstead,
with some decayed remnants of furniture,
•covered with dust and cobwebs, and which
seemed indeed as if they had not been mov ed
for many years* Desirous, however, of ex-
amining further, she attempted to raise what
appeared to have been part of the bedstead;
but it slipped from her hand, and, rolling to
the floor, brought with It some of the re-
mainine lumber* Adeline started aside and
saved herself; and when the noise "it made
had ceased, she heard a small rustling sound,
and as she was abont to leave the chamber,
saw something falling gently among the
'lumber.
It wa§ a small loll of paper, tied -with a
string, and coVered with dust. Adeline took
It up, and on ©peaifig it perceived a hand
writing. She attempted to read, it, hut the
part of the manuscript she looked at was so
much obliterated, that she found'1 this diffi-
cult, though what few words were legible

iitqwcfiHcd Iter wWi curiosity mn\ terror, and
induced her to return with It immediately to
her chamber.
Having reached lie rownroom, she fastened
the private door, and let the arras fall oter it
m before, It was now midnight. The still-
ness of the hour, interrupted only at interval*
by the hollow sighings of the blast, heighi-
etied the solemnity of Adeline's feelings*
She wished she was not alone, and before
she proceeded to look Into the manuscript,
listened whether Madame La Motto was yet
in her chamber;—not the least sound was
heard, unci she gently opened the door. The
profound silence within almost convinced her
that no person was there; but willing to be
further satisfied, she brought the light anil
found the room empty* The lateness of the
hour made her wonder that Madame La
Motte was not In her chamber, and she pro-
ceeded to the top of the tower stairs, to
hearken if any person was stirring*
She heard the sound of voices from below,
and, amongst the rest, that of La Motto
ipeaking in Ms usual tone, .Doing now
satisfied that all was well, she turned towards
tier room, when she heasd the Marquis pro-
nounce her name with very unusual emphasis.
8be paused* 1 adore her, pursued he, and
by Iieaveiw-.He was interrupted by La
Motte, my l^ord, remember your promise.
1 do, replied the Marquis, and 1 will abide
b? it. But we trifle. To-morrow 1 will de-
clare myself, and 1 shall then know both what
to hope and how to act. Adeline trembled so
excessively, that she could scarcely support
herself: she wished to return toher chamber;
yet ihe wa§ too much interested in the words
she had heard, not to be anxious to have
them more fully explained. There was an
interval of silence, lifter which they conversed
in a lower tone. Adeline remembered the
hints of Theodore, and determined, If pos-
sible, to be relieved from the terrible suspense
»he now suffered. She stole softly down a
few steps, that she might catch trie accents
of the speakers, but they were so low that
she could only now and then distinguish a
few words, tier father, say you? said the
Marquis. Yes, my Lord, her father. 1 am
well informed of what i say. Adeline shud-
dered at the mention of her father, a new
terror seized her, and with increasing eager-
ness she endeavoured to distinguish their
words, but for some time found this to be
impossible. • Here h no time to be lost, said
the Marquis, to-morrow then.—-She hetel
La Motte rise, and believing It was to leave
the room, she hurried up the steps, and
having reached her chamber, sunk almost
lifeless in % chair.
It wa« her father only of whom she thought.
Slit doubted not .that he had pursued' and
4istorered her retreat; and though this con-
JS
duct appeared very inronslstefct with hit
former iwhaviour in abandoning hesto strati*
gew, her fears suggested that it would termi-
nate in S'.mic new' cruelly. She did not Itesf-
tate to pronounce this "the danger of which
Theodore had warned her| but ft was iinpos»
siblc to surmise how lie had gained Ms know-
ledge of k, or how he had become sufficiently
acquainted with her story, except through
La Motte, her apparent friend and protector,
whom she was thus, though unwillingly, led
to suspect of treachery. Why, indeed, should
La Motte conceal from her only his know-
ledge of her father's intention, unless lie
designed to deliver het Info his hands? Yet
it wee long ere she could bring herself to
believe this conclusion possible* To dts*
cover depravity in those whom we have loved*
is one of the most exquisite tortures to a
virtuous mind, and the conviction Is often
rejected before it Is finally admitted.
The words of Theodore, which told her ho
was fearful she was deceived, confirmed this
most painful apprehension of 1m Motte, with
another yet more distressing, that Madame
1m Motte was also united against her. This
thought, for a moment, subdued terror mi
left her only grief; she wept 'bitterly. •; Is
this human nature f cried she* Am I doomed'
to find every body deceitful? An ttnexpeeted
discovery of vice in those whom we have
Admired, Inclines us to extend our censor* of
the individual to the species;' wo henceforth
contemn appearances, find too hastily coti-
clude that no person i» to tie trusted.
Adeline determined to throw herself at the
feet of La Motte on the following morning,
and implore his pity and protection. Her
mind was now too much agitated by her own
interests to permit her to examine the matin-
scripts, and she sat musing in her chair till
she heard the steps of Madame La Motte,
when she retired to bed. 1a Motte soon after
came up to his chamber; and Adeltne, the
mild, persecuted Adeline, who had now-
passed two days of torturing anxiety, and
one night of terrific visions, endeavoured w
compose her mind to sleep. In the present
state of her spirits she quickly caught alarm,
and she had scarcely fallen hi to a slumber
when she mm roused by a loud and un-
common noise. She listened, and thmtght
the sound came from the apartments below,
but in a few minutes there was is hasty
knocking at the door of La Motte*s chsmber.
La Motte, who hail just fallen asleep, wa»
not easily to be roused; but the knocking
increased with such violence, that Adeline,
extremely terrified, arose and went to the
ioor that opened trom her chamber' into his,
with a design to call him. She wm stopped
by the voice of the Marquis, which1 lilt 'ttttw
efcarly distinguished at the imt, 'He called

This, mm Madaine' La Mot®, i would
most readily consent to, would our situation
Txgrmit it. But yon well know our asylum
In this abbey depends upon the good-will of
tl|e. jklarquis, 'which' wfe must not wantonly

pose would endanger'tliis* lM us use milder
measures, and -we shall preserve his friendship

Adeline sighed* I obey you, Madam; said
'she $' it is my duty to do so: 'but i may be
pardoned for -saying—-it is with extreme rc-
 fuctance. Madaote La Motte promised to go
immediately to her husband; and Adeline
departed, though not convinced of her safety,
yet somewhat more at ease,
 She soon'alter saw the Marquis depart;
mild a* there  now appeared to be no obstacle
to th© return of Madame La Motte, she ex-
]M!ctcd her with extreme impatience. After
tb.ua .watting near an hour in her chamber,
ahe^as at length summoned to the parlour,
afid there found Monsieur La Motte alone.
lie. arose, upon her entrance, and for some
minutes paced the room in silence. He then
. seated feimself, and addressed her; What you
have mentioned to Madame La Motte, said
he, ..wpuld give me much concern, did I con-
sicler the behaviour of the Marquis in a light
to serious as she does. I know that young
ladies -«re apt'to misconstrue the unmeaning
gallantry of fashionable manners; and you,
Adeline,, can never be too cautious in distin-
guishing between a levity of this kind and a
inoxe serious address.
'"Adeline Was surprised and offended that
,/1^Motte'Should think so lightly both of her
understanding and disposition as his speech
implied. Is it possible, Sir, said she, that
ypu„ have been, apprized of the Marquis's
CDttifttCt?'
It is very possible, and very certain, replied
La; ,Bf e*te with some asperity; and very pos-
sible^also, that I may see this affair with a
 judgment 'less 'discoloured by prejudice than
yQii do. JBut, however, I shall not dkpnte
this point; I shall only request that, since
you. are acquainted with the emergency of my
circumstances, you will conform to them, and
not,.by an ill-timed resentment,.expose me to
. the enmity; of 'the j||ajrquis* Beujsiiow my
$&nd, and'it,is necessary to /ny 'safety that
; ho.should continue, such; but if 1, suffer any
ruftof .my family io treat Mm with rudeness,
_ ...^ipt,,. expect ,to see him my enemy, You
.ww.iureif treat Ipm with complaisance.
Adeline.,, thought the term mdemts a harsh
: .one; as .La Motte applied it, but she forbore
, . fs©j»,,#iy expression of displeasure. I could
:;.Ji#f^wished, Si% sail she, for the privilege
of retiring whenever the Marquis appeared;
but since you believe this conduct would
affect your interest, I ought to submit
This prudence and good-will delightn me,
said La Motto; and since yon wish to servo
me, know that yon cannot more effectually <io
it than by treating the Marquis as a friend.
The word/mw/, 'as it stood connected with
the Marquis, sounded dissonantly to Ade-
line's car; she hesitated, and looked at JLa
Motte. As your frknd, Sir, said she, 1 will
endeavour to—treat him as mine, she would
have said, but she found it impossible in
finish the sentence. She entreated his pro-
tection from the power of her father.
What protection I can afford is yours, said
1m Motte; but you know how destitute 1
'am both of the right and the means of resist-
ing him, and also how much I require pro-
tection myself* Since he has discovered your
retreat, he is probably not ignorant of the
circumstances which detain me here; and if
1 oppose him,'-, he may betray me to the offi-
cers of the law, as the surest method of
obtaining possession of you. We are encom-
passed with dangers, continued La Motte;
would I could see any method of extricating
ourselves!
. Quit this abbey, said Adeline, and seek an
asylum in Switzerland or Germany; you will
then be. freed from further obligation to I he
Marquis, and.from the persecution you dread.
Pardon me for thus offering advice, which is
certainly in some degree prompted by a sense
of ,my own safety, but which, at the same
time, seems to afford the only means of en*
gyring yours*
Your plan is reasonable, said La Motte,
had I money to execute it* As it is, I must
be contented to remain here as • little known
as possible, and defend myself by making
those who know me my friends, .'Chiefly I
must endeavour, to preserve the favour of the
Marquis: he may do much, should your fa-
ther even pursue desperate measures. But
why do I talk thus? your father may ere this
have commenced these measures, and the
effects of his vengeance may now'be hanging
over my head. My .regard for you, Adeline,
has exposed me to this; had I resigned you
to his will, I should have remained secure.
Adeline was so much affected by this in-
stance of La Motte's kindness, which she
could not doubt, that she was unable to ex-
pi ess her sense of it. When she could speak,
she, uttered her gratitude in the most lively
terms.—Are you sincere in these expressions?
said lis Motte. ''
Is it possible I can be less than, sincere?
replied Adeline, weeping at the idea of in»
gratitude.-—Sentiments are easily pronounced,
said La Motte, though they may have no con-
..section with the heart;' I believe them to he
sincere so far only as they inluence our actions.

1 oust the offer which I now make yo% both
of my ikkt and fortune, will, sufficiently
prove the sincerity of mf attachment,' and
atone im the transgression which love only
prompted*
After this specimen of common-place ver-
bosity, which the Marquis seemed to consider
as a prelude to triumph, lie attempted to im.
press, a kiss upon the hand of Adeline, who,
withdrawing it hastily, said, You are already,
my Lord, acquainted with my sentiments
upon this subject, and it is almost.unneces-
sary for me now to repeat that I cannot ac-
cept the honour yon offer pie.
Explain yourself, lovely Adeline! I am
iirnorant that till now 1 ever made you this
oiler.
Most true, Sir, said Adeline; and you do
well to remind me of this, since, after having
heard your former proposal, 1 cannot listen
lor a moment to any other, She rose to quit
the room, Stay, Madam, said the Marquis,
with a look, in which offended pride struggled
•to conceal itself; do not suffer an extravagant
resentment to operate against your true in.
terests; recollect the, dangers that surround
you, and consider the value of an offer which
may afford you at least an honourable asylum.
My misfortunes, my Lord, whatever they
are, 1. have never obtruded upon you; you
will, therefore, excuse my observing, that
your present mention of them conveys a much
greater appearance of insult than compassion.
The Marquis, though with evident confusion,
was going to reply; but Adeline would not
be detained, and retired to her chamber.
Destitute m she was, -her heart revolted from
the proposal of. the Marquis, and "she deter-
mined never to, accept it ,. To' her' dislike of
his general disposition, and' the aversion ex-
cited by his late offer, was, added, Indeed, the

Unhappy main I she exclaimed s and was

wards it, lest some other face than her own
ehoald meet her eyes: other dreadful ideas
and strange images of fantastic thought now
crossed her mind.

thankful; but upon going down to breakfast,
this transient gleam of peace fled upon the
appearance of the Marquis, whose frequent
visits at the abbey, after what had passed,
not only displeased, but alarmed her. She
saw that he was determined to persevere in ad-
'dressing hers and the boldness and insensihi-
lity of this conduct, while it excited her in-
dignation, increased her disgust In pity to
La Motte, she endeavoured to conceal these
emotions, though she now thought that he re-
quired too much from her complaisance, and
began seriously to consider how she might
avoid the necessity of continuing it The
Marquis behaved to her with the most respect-
ful attention; but Adeline was silent and re-
served, and seized the first opportunity of
withdrawing.
As she passed up the spiral staircase, Peter
entered the hall below, and seeing Adeline,
he stopped and looked earnestly at her; site
did not observe him, but he called her softly,
and she then saw him make a signal, as if lie
had something to communicate. In the next
instant, La Motte, opened the door of the
vaulted room, and Peter hastily disappeared.
She proceeded to her chamber, ruminating
upon this signal, and the cautious manner in
which Peter "had given it.
But her thoughts soon returned to their
wonted subjects. Three days were now
passed, and she heard no intelligence of her
father; she began to hope that he had re-
lented from the violent measures hinted at by
lia Motte, and that he meant, to pursue a
milder plan j but when she considered his
character, this appeared improbable, and she
relapsed into her forma fears* Her .residence
at the abbey was now become painful, from
the perseverance of the Marquis and the con-
duct which La Motte obliged her to adopt;
yet she could not think without dread of
quitting it to wtum to her father.
The.image of. Theodore often intruded
upon her busy thought*, and brought with it
a pang which his- itrange departure occa-
sioned. She had a confused notion that his
fate was somehow connected with her own;
and her strugglas to prevent the remembrance
of hini served only to show how much her
heart was his.
To divert her thoughts from these subjects,
and gratify the curiosity so strongly excited
on the preceding night, she now took up the
BIS. but was hindered from opening it by
the entrance of Madame La Motte, who came
to tell her the Marquis was gone. They
passed their morning together in work and
general conversation; La Motte not appear-
ing till dinner, when he said little, and Ade-
line less. She asked him, however, if he had
heard from her father? I have not heard
, torn him, said La Motte; but there is good

state of alarm, cariosity, 'find vexation. She
walked'oiit into the forest ruminating upon
Peters words, and endeavouring to guess to
what they alluded t there Madame La Motto,
joined her, and they  con?ersed 'OR various
topics till they Cached the abbey.
Adeline watched in tain through that day
for ail  opportunity of speaking with Peter,
While he wafted at supper, she occasionally
observed-his countenance with great anxiety,
hoping it might afford her some degree of in-
telligence on the subject of her fears. When
she retired,' Madame La Motte accompanied
her tohetf chamber, and continued to converse
with her'fbr a considerable time, so that she
had no means of obtaining an interview with
Peter.—.Madame La Motte appeared to labour
under some great affliction; and when Ade*
line,""-notfciiig this, entreated to know the
cause of her dejection, tears started into her
eyes,' and she abruptly left the room.
This behaviour of Madame La Motte con-
curred with Peter's discourse to alarm Ade-
line, #ho sat pensively upon her heel, giving
up lift'"reflection, till she was roused by the
sound of a' clock, which stood in the room be-
low,"and which now struck twelve. She was
preparing ' for rest, when she recollected the
MS;- and'was unable to conclude the night
without reading it The first words she
could distinguish were the following:

I Have climbed to the casement, thinking the

sotrtewhat enable me to support these afflic

Adeline shuddered. She feared to read the
coming sentence, yet curiosity prompted her
to proceed* Still she paused: an unaccounUu
hie dread came over her. Some horrid deed
has been done here, said she; the reports of
the peasants are true: murder has been com.
mitted. The idea thrilled her with horror.
She recollected the dagger which had impe-
ded her steps in the secret chamber, and this
circumstance served to confirm her most ter-
rible conjectures. She wished to examine it,
hut it lay in one of these chambers, and she
feared to go in quest of it*
Wretched, wretched victim! she exclaimed,
could no friend rescue thee from destruction I
O that I had been near I Yet what could 1
have clone to save thee? Alas I nothing. 1
forget that even now, perhaps, I am, like
thee, abandoned to dangers from which 1 have
no friend to succour me. Too surely I guess
the author of thy miseries! She stopped,
and thought she heard a sigh, such as on the
preceding night had passed along the chain*
ber. Her blood was chilled, and she sat mo-
tionless. The lonely situation of her room,
remote from the mnt of the family, (for she
was now in her old apartment, from which
Madame La Motte had removed,) who were
almost beyond call, struck so forcibly upon
her imagination, that she with difficulty pre-
served herself from fainting. She sat few a
considerable time, and all was still. When
she was somewhat recovered, her, first design
, was to alarm the family; but further reflec-
tion again withheld her*
She endeavoured to compose her spirits,
and addressed a short prayer to that Being,
who had hitherto protected her in every dan-
ger* While she was thus employed,, her
mind gradually became elevated and re*
assured; a-sublime 'complacency filled her
heart, and »he sat dowa once more to piasue •

A(!"line could not go on. All the circuw*
Mance* that scented to corroborate the fate of
i his unhappy man, crowded upon her mind ;—
the reports concerning the abbey~~thc dreams
which had forerun her discovery of the pri-
vate apartments—-the singular manner in
which she had found the MS.—and the ap-
parition, which slit* now believed she had
rc;;Uy *»een. She blamed herself for not
having yet mentioned the discovery of the
manuscript and chambers to La Motto, and
!'..>•»tived to delay the disclosure no longer
thn; the following morning. The immediate
t-'.u,» that had occupied her mind, and a fear
i if hmng the manuscript before she had wad
it, had hitherto kept her silent.
Such a combination of circumstance*?, she
h.Iicml, could only be produced by some sii-
perr.iiutral power,' operating for the retribu-
tion of the*guilty. These reflections filled
Kir mind with a degree of awe which flic
loneliness of the large old chamber in which
Mie sat, and the hour of the night, mm
heightened into terror. She had never been
superstitious, hut circumstances so uncom-
mon had hitherto conspired in this affair, that
«he'could not believft them accidental. Her
imagination", wrought upon by these rciec-
tiorjR, again became sensible to every impres-
sion; she feared to look *Wnd, lest she should
again see' some dreadful phantom, and she
almost fincied she heard voices swell fa the
storm which now shook the fabric.
Still she Ified to command her feelings so
as tit'avoid disturbing -the family ; but they
became §o painful, that even the dread of La
Mottffg ttidicule had hardly power to prevent
her quitting the chamber. Her mind was now
in inch a stated  that she found it impossible
to pursue the story in the MS* though, to
avojd the tortiircs of suspense, she had at-

proved Adeline for'suffering her fancies to
overcome her reason. She now mentioned
the discovery the had made of the inner, cham-
ber and the manuscript, circumstances which
roused the attention of . La Motto so much*
that he desired to see the. MS. jmd reiwlved
.to go immediately to the apartments described
by Adeline. . , .
Madame La Motte endeavoured to dissuade
him from his purpose; but La Motte,. with
whom opposition had always an effect con-
trary to the one designed, mil who wished to,
throw further ridicule upon the terrors of Ad^
eline, persisted in his intention. He called
to Feim to attend with a light, and insisted
that Madame La Motte and Adeline .should
accompany him. Madame 1M Motte desired
to he excused, and Adeline at first declared
she could not go; but he would be obeyed.
They ascended the tower, and entered the first
chambers together, for each of the party was
reluctant to be the last; In the second cbftHJt*

Lord' bless your honour, said Peter, don't
Jrou'see 1 can't reach them; besides, 1 don't
believe they are made to open; see what
strong iron bars there-are; the room looks
for all the world like a prison: 1 suppose
this- is the place the people meant, when they
said nobody 4hat had been in ever came out.
La Motte, who during this speech had been
looking attentively at the high windows,
whieh if he had §een them at first he had eer-
tainly not observed, now interrupted the elo-
quence of Pete?, and bade him carry the light
before them. They all willingly quitted
'these chambers, and returned to the room
below, where a ire was lighted, and the party
remained together for some time.
La Motte for reasons best known to him-
self, attempted to ridicule the discovery and
fears of Adeline, till she with a seriousness
that checked him, entreated he would desist
lie was silent-; and soon after, Adeline, en-
couraged by the return of daylight, ventured
to-her chamber, and for some hours experi-
enced the blessing of undisturbed repose.
On the following day, Adeline's first care
'Was to obtain an interview with Peter, whom
she had some hopes of seeing as she went
downstairs: h% however, did not appear;
flnd she proceeded to the fitting-room, where
fche found La Motte appparently much dis-
turbed. Adeline asked him if he had looked
'at the MS, I have ran my eye over it, said
lie, but it is so much obscured by time that It
can scarcely be deciphered. It appears to ex-
hibit a strange romantic story $ and I do not
wonder that after yoit had suffered its terrors
to impress your Imagination, you fancied yon
siaw spectres and heard wondrous noises.
Adeline thought La Motte did not choose
- to - be convinced, and she therefore forbore
reply. During breakfast she often looked at
Pete (who waited) with anxious inquiry;
and from Ms countenance was still more as-
- aured that he had something of importance to
communicate. In the hope of some conver-
sation with him, she left the room as soon m
possible, and repaired to her favourite avenue,
where she bad not long remained when he ap-
peared.
Ood bless you! Ma'mselle, said he, I'm
sorry I .frighted you m hist night.
frighted mc, said Adeline; how was you
'coaeerned ia that?
.He {heir informed her that when he -thought
'Hoftiicurand Madame La Motte were asleep,
he bad stolen to her chamber deot, miih an
.intention of giving her the sequel of what he
had begun in the morning; that he. had called
several times as loudly as he dared; but ?«•
ceiving no answer, he believed she was aslap,
or did not choose to speak with him, and he
had therefore left the door. This account of
the voice she had heard, relieved Adding
spirits; she was even surprised that she did
not know it, till remembering the perturha.
tion of her mind for some lime preceding,
this surprise disappeared.
She entreated Peter to be brief in explain.
Ing the danger with which she was threatened.
If you'll let me go on,my own way, Ma'am,
you'll soon know it;, but if you hurry me,
and ask me questions here and there, out of
their places, 1 don't know what I am saying,
. Be It so, said Adeline; only, remember
that we may be observed.
Yes. Ma'msclle, I*m as much afraid of
that as you are, for 1 believe J should be al-
most as ill off; however, that is neither here
nor there, but I'm sure if yon stay in tins old
abbey another night it will be worse for you;
for, as i said before, I know all about it
What mean you, Peter?
- Why, about this scheme that's going on.
What then, is my father.*—.?—Vour
father! interrupted Peter; Lord bless y<m,
that is all fudge, to frighten yon; your father,
nor nobody else has ever sent after you; 1
dare say he knows no more of you, thai:, the
Pope does—not he. Adeline looked dis-
pleased. Yott trifle, said she; if you have
any thing to tell, say it quickly; Iain in
haste. '*- ',
Bless you, young,lady% I meant f.o harm,
I hope you're not angry; 'but I'm sure you
can't deny that your father is cruel. But its
I was saying, tne Marquis deMontalt likes
you; and he and toy master (Peter looked
round) have been laying their heads together
about you. Adeline turned, pale? she com-
prehended a part of the truth, aM eagerly en-
treated him to proceed.
They have been laying their heads to-
f ether about you. This is what Jaqucs tk
farquis's man tells me: Says he, Peter, ;'ou
little know what is going on: I could tell all
if I chose it; but it is not for those who are
trusted to tell again. I Warrant how your
master is close enough with you. Upon
which I was piqued, and resolved to make him
believe I could he trusted as well as lie Per*.

..  • Adeline agreed to the tiuth of all this, anil
wm- somewhat surprised at Peter*s sagacity,
#hc inquired if he knew of any place in the
'Hdtfhboitfhood of the abbey, where she could
remain concealed, till he came with a horse.
.Why yes, Madam, there is a place, now 1
 think of it,'where you may be safe enough,
for nobody goes near; but they say it's
haunted, and perhaps you would not like to go
there. Adeline, remembering .the last night,
'Was somewhat startled at this intelligence;
hut a sense of her present danger pressed again
upon her mind, and overcame every other ap-
.-prehension. Where is this place? said she;
tf it will conceal me, I shall not hesitate
.• It is an old tomb that stands in the thickest
part of the forest, about a quarter of a mile
, off* the nearest way and almost a mile the
.•.other* When my master used to hide him-
nelf -to much in the forest, 1 have followed
him somewhere thereabouts, but I did not
:find oat the tomb till t'other day. However,
< that's, neither here nor there; if yon dare yen.
 tureito it, Ma'mselle, 1*11 show you the near-
 *at. way. So saying he pointed to a winding
''path 'on the right* Adeline, having looked
fbuiul without perceiving any person near, di-
rected >Peter to lead her to the tomb: they
pursued the path, till turning into a gloomy
vomantic part of the forest, almost impervious
to < the rays of the sun, they came to the spot
'whither Louis had formerly traced his father.
 ' The stillness and solemnity of the scene
•truck awe upon the heart of Adeline, who
62
paused and surveyed ii! for*some tiniein' si-
lence. At length Peter led hm Into the inte-
rior part of the ruin, to which theyikicemltil
by several steps. Some old abbot, "%iM he,
was formerly buried here,- as 'the*Marquis's
people say; arid it's like enough that he he-
longed to the abbey yonder,  But I <ton*t. *eo
why he should take it in his head to'walk';: he
wax not murdered, surely'!' '- '• '""
I hope not, said Adeline.    - , .
That's more' than can be said-for'all/ fliaf
lies buried at the abbey though^'aittl^-^-—
Adeline interrupted'him:-Hark! surely I
hear a noiss, said she; Heaven protect; us
from discovery! They listened,-but" all was
still; and they went on, Peter opened a low
door, and they entered upon'-a dark passage,
frequently obstructed by-loose'fragments of
stone, and along which they moved' With 'cau-
tion. Whithev are we going ?' said Adeline.
—I scarcely know myself* said Peter, for 1
never was so far before, but the place /scenw
quiet enough. Something obstructed his;#ay;
it was a door which yielded to lis hand,'and
discovered a kind of cell obscurely geeri brjthe
twilight admitted through a grate;abo,te.*''; A
partial gleam shot athwart the place, leaving
tlie greatest part of it in shadow.- * • •' * ' •!"
Adeline sighed as she surveyed it,"* This »
a frightful spot, said she: hut if "it #111 aflbrd
me a shelter, it is a palace. Rera'ejtnbcr,"'Pe-

THE ROMANCE OF THE FOREST.
 
extravagance and danger of this conduct: she
feuppresicd her emotions, but they at length
compelled her t© withdraw from the presence
of Madame 1m Motte.
CHAP. X.
Thou! to whom the world unknown
With all its shadow? shaj>*'y- in sh<»\vn;
Who set'st ajipailM tli* unreal h«*c»!H%
White fancy hit* the v^iltH'tween;
Ah, Fear! ah, frantic fear I
1 see, I sec thee ni'ar!
1 ktiyw-thy hurrv'd st«'p, tin* haggard eve
Like thee i start* like thee dUorUcr'd ily!
Adeline aiitiowsly watched from her cham-
ber window the turn set behind the distant
hills, and the time of her departure draw nigh;
it set with uncommon splendour, and threw
a fiery gleam athwart the woods and upon
spine scattered fragments of the ruins, which
she could not gaze upon with indifference.-
'Never, probably, again shall I see the sun
sink below those hills, said she, or illumine
this scene 1 Where shall 1 be when, next it
sets—where this time to-morrow? sunk per-
haps in misery! She wept at the thought.
A few hours, resumed Adeline, and the j\lar-
cjuia will arrive—-a few hours, and this abbey
will be a scene of confusion and tumult: every -
eye will be in search of me, every recess will
he explored. These reflections inspired her
with new terror, arid increased her impatience
to be gone.
Twilight gradually came on, and she now
thought it sufficiently dark to venture forth j
but before she went, she kneeled down and
addressed herself to Heaven, She implored
support and protection, and committed her-
self to the care of the Clod of mercies. Having'
done this, she quitted her chamber, and
passed with cautious steps down the winding
staircase. Mo person appeared, and she pro-
ceeded through the door of the tower into the
forest. She looked around; the gloom of the
evening obscured every object.
With a trembling heart she sought the
path pointed out by Peter, which led to the
tomb: having found it, she passed along
forlorn and terrified. Often did "she start aa
the breeze shook the light leaves of the trees#
or as the bat flitted by gamboling in the twi-
light; and often, as she looked hack towards
the abbey, thought she distinguished amid
the deepening gloom the igures of men.
Saving proceeded some way, she suddenly
beard the feet of horses, and goon, after a
sound of voice*, among which she distin-
guished that of the Marquis; they seemed to
come from the quarter she was approaching,
and evidently advanced. Tenor for some
minutes wrested her steps; she stood in »
state ef dreadful hesitation: to proceed was
to run into the hands of the Marquis; to
return was to fall into the power of La Alotte.
After remaining for some time uncertain
whither to fly, the sounds suddenly tuok a
difTcrent direction, and wheeled towards the
abbey. Adeline had a short cessation of
terror; she now understood that the JMarquin
had passed this spot only in his way to the
abbey, and she hastened to secrete hci^If in
the ruin. At length, after much diih'ouhv.
she reached it, the deep shades almost con-
cealing it from her search. She paused at
the entrance, awed by the solemnity that
reigned within, and the titter darkness of the
place; at length she determined to watch
without till Peter should arrive. If any
person approaches, said she, 1 can hear them
before they can see me, and 1 can then secrete
myself in the cell.
She leaned against a fragment of the tomb
in trembling expectation, and as she listened,
no sound broke the silence of the hour. The
state of tier mind can only be imagined by,
considering that upon the present time turned
the -crisis of her fate. They have bow, thought
she* discovered rny flight; even now they are
seeking me in every part of the abbey; 1 hear
their dreadful voices call me; I see their
eager looks. The power of imagination al-
most overcame her. While she yet looked
around, she saw lights moving at a distance;
sometimes they glimmered between the trees,
and sometimes they totally disappeared.
. They seemed to.be in a direction with the
abbey; and she now remembered that in the
morning she had seen a part of the fabric
through an opening in the forest. She had
therefore no doubt that the - lights she saw
proceeded from people in search of her: who,
she feared, not finding her at the abbey,
might direct their steps towards the tomb.
Her place of refuge now seemed too near her
enemies to be safe, and she would have fled
to a more distant part of the forest, but recol-
lected that Peter would, not know where to
find her.
While these thoughts passed over her mtnov
she heard distant voices in the wind, and
was hastening to conceal herself In the cell,
when she observed the lights suddenly dis-
appear. All was soon after hushed in silence
and darkness, yet she endeavoured to find the
way to the cell. She remembered the situation
©f the outward door and of the passage, anVl
having passed these, she unclosed the door ot
the cell. Within it was utterly dark* She
trembled violently, but entered; and having
felt about the walls, at length seated herself
on a projection of stone
She here again addressed herself to Heaven,
and endeavoured to re-animate her spirit! til
Peter should arrive. Above half an> horn
elapsed in this gloomy recess, and bo found
foretoldjtis approach. Her spirits sunk; »ht

feefud some part of their »hm was dtseovwod

|jt Motte* Tills conviction operated some*
tiiiiet so strongly upon Iter fears, m to mm
her to quit file cell alone, and seek In flight
her only cheneo of escape.
While this destga was fluctuating in het
mind* she distinguished through tins grate
abovt ft clattering of hoofs. The noise *p»
froaehed, and at length stopp«l at the tomb.
ii the succeeding moment she beard three
strokes of a whip; her heart beat, and for *ome
moments her agitation was such, that slit* made
no effort to quit the cell. The stroke** wow
repeated; the now mused her spirits, and
stepping forward, ascended to the forest. Slio
called Peter; for the deep gloom would not
permit her to* distinguish either man or horse.
She was quickly answered, I lush! Ma'uiaclle,
our voice* will betray us.
They mounted and rode off a* fast as the
darkness would permit. Adoltne's heart
revived at every step they took. She inquired
what hail pawned at the abt>cy, and how he
ha<l contrived to get away. Speak softly,
Ma'maeUe; yoti*H kttow all hy and by, hut

ere they saw lights move along at a distance;
and coaling mm to a more ojven pan of the
forest, he net off cm a full gallop, and conti-
nued the pare till the horse could hold it no
longer. They looked back, and no lights
appearing, Adeline's terror subsided. She
inquired again what had passed at the abbey
when her flight was discovered. Vou may
speak without fear of being heard, said she,
we arc gone beyond their reach, 1 hope.
Why* Ma*m*ellc, said he, you had not
been gone long before the Marquis arrived,
and Monsieur 1a Motte then found out you
was fled. t)nm this a great rout there waa,
md he talked a great deal with the Marquis*
Speak louder, said Adeline, 1 cannot near
you.
1 will, Ma'mselle-—
Oh! hemveni I interrupted Adeline, What

Marquis's nefvunt, ettej»pted to leap to the
froundj but the man* dbimountlng, bound
er to the horse. One feeble my of hopt at
length beamed upon hor mind s the endea-

TH^, ROMANCE OF THE. FQRJSgT.
music, breathing such dulcet and entrancing
mrarids is suspended grief and awaked the
tiouifo tenderness and pensive pleasure. Add-
liftc listened: in surprise, and' insensibly" be-
came soothed and interested; a 'tender mulan-
elioly stole upoh her heart, and subdued every
'harsherfeeling: but the moment the strain
ceased, the' enchantment dissolved, and she
returned to a sense of her situation.
Again the music'sounded—music such as
charmcth  sleep—and again she gradually
yielded to its sweet magic. A female voice,
'accompanied by a lute, a hautboy, and a few
other' Instruments, now gradually swelled
• into' a tone so exquisite as raised attention
Into ecstasy. It sunk b'y degrees, and touched
11 'few simple notes with pathetic softness,
when the measure was* suddenly changed, and
in a gay and airy melody Adeline distin-
guished the following words:
SONO.
Life's a varied, Wight Illusion,
Joy and Sorrow—-light and shade;
Turn from sorrow'* dark suffusion,
Dutch the |fle«ui-es ere they fade.-
 Fancy paints with lines unreal,
Smile of bliss, and sorrow's uiood;
If tlieybotb are but Meat,
Why reject the seaming good?
Hence! no «toVe! 'tis Wisdom calls ye,
- Bid3 ft» court Time's present aid;
The future trust not—Hope enthralls ye,
"Catch the pleasures ere they fade.*'
The music ceased; but the sounds still
vibrated on her imagination, and she was
sunk in the pleasing languor they had in-
spired, when the door opened, and the Mar-
quis de Montalt appeared. He approached
the sofa where Adeline sat, and addressed her,
hut she heard not,his voice—she had Muted,
lie endeavoured to recover her, and at length
succeeded; hut when she unclosed her ^eyes,
and again beheld hint, *he relapsed into a
state of insensibility; and having in Yam
tried various methods to restore her, he was
obliged to call assistance." Two young wo-
%v.:n entered; and when she began to revive,
he left them to prepare her for his re-appear-
ance. When Adeline perceived that the
Marquis was gone, and that she was in the
care of women,'her spirits gradually returned;
she looked at her attendants, and was sur-
prised to see so much elegance and beauty.
Some endeavour she made ,to interest their
pity; but they seemed wholly insensible to
her distress, and began to talk of the Marquis
in terms of the- highest admiration. They
assured her it would be her own fault if she
was not happy, and advised her to appear so
in his presence. It was with the utmost
difficulty that Adeline forbore to express the
disdain which was rising to her .lips, and that
she listened ,to their discourse in silence. But
she saw the inconvenience and .fhutlessness of
opposition, and she commanded her feel.
They were thus proceeding in their praises
of the Marquis, when he himself appeared;
and waving his Band, 'they immediately
quitted the apartment. Adeline beheld him
with a kind of mute despair while he ap-
proached and took her hand, which she has-
tily withdrew; and turning from him with a
look of unutterable distress, burst into tears.
He was for some time silent, and appeared
softened by her anguish j but again approach-
ing and addressing her in a gentle voice, lie
entreated her pardon for the step which
despair, and, as he called it, love had prompted.
She was too much absorbed in griet to reply,
till he solicited a return of his love; when
her sorrow yielded to indignation, and she
reproached him with his conduct. He pleaded
that he had long loved and Sought her upon
honourable terms, and his offer of those terms
he began to repeat; but raising his eyes to-
wards Adeline, he saw in her looks the con-
tempt which he was conscious he deserved
For a moment he was confused, and seemed
to understand both that his plan was dis-
covered and his person despised; but soon
resuming his usual command' of feature, he
again pressed his suit, 'and solicited her love.
A little refection showed, Adeline the danger
of exasperating his pride by an avowal of the
contempt which his pretended offer of mar-
riage excited; and she thought it not im-
proper, upon an occasion in which the honour
and peace of her life was concerned, to yield
somewhat to the policy of dissimulation. She
saw that her only chance _ of escaping hi*
designs depended upon delaying them, ami
she now wished him to' believe ner ignorant
that the Marchioness was living, and that his
offers were delusive.
 He observed her pause; and ift the eager-
ness to turn her hesitation to Ms''advantage,
renewed his 'proposal 'with increased vehe-
mence.-—To-morrow shall unite' 'usr lovely
Adeline;' to-morrow you shall Consent to be-
come the Marchioness etc Montalt' You 'will
then return my love and-——— _'
You must first deserve my esteem, my Lord.
1 will—I do deserve it. Are you not now
in my power, and do 1. not forbear to take
advafitage of your situation'?' Bo I not make
you the most honourable- proposals ?—Ade-
line shuddered:, If you 'wish 1 should'esteem
you, my Lord, endeavour, if possible, to mate
me forget by what means 1 came into jom
power; if your views are indeed honourable*
prove them so by releasing 'mc from my con-
finement.'
Can you then wish, lovely Adeline, to fly
from him who adores you? replied the 'Mar-
quis with n" studied* air of tenderness. Why
will you exact sd severe a proof of wy dis-
interestedness, a 'disrateresttdness which, ia
 
 
Ttm noMAN< k or mi: ¥Oimi\
t^
 
 
not eonawUrnt'with love? Ko, charming
Adeline! let me at ler&st have the pleasure of
beholding you till tlie bonds of the church
shall remove every obstacle to my love, T,o-
morrow——-.
Adeline saw the danger to which she was
now exposed, and interrupted, him. Deserve
my esteem, Sir, and then you will obtain it:
«s a first step towards which, liberate me
front a confinement that obliges me to look on
you only with terror and aversion. Uow can I
believe your professions of love, while you
show that you have no interest in my happi-
ness ?—Thus did Adeline, to whom {hearts
and the practice of dissimulation were hitherto
equally unknown, condescend to make use of
thetn In disguising her indignation and con-
tempt But though these aits were adopted
only for the purpose of self-preservation, she
used them with reluctance, and almost with
abhorrence; for her mind was habitually im-
pregnated with the love of virtue, in thought,
word, and action; and while her end in
using them was certainly good, she scarcely
thought that end could justify the muaijs.
The Marquis persisted in his sophistry.
Can you doubt the reality of that love, which
to obtain you has urged me to risk your dis-
pleasure? But htfve 1 not consulted your
happiness, even Li the very conduct which
you condemn? F have removed you from a
solitary and desolate ruin to a gay and splen-
did villa, where every luxury is at your
command, and where every person shall be
obedient to your wishes.
My'first wish is to go hence, said Adeline;
1 entreat, I conjure you, my horn,, no longer
to detain' me. I am a friendless and wretched
orphan, exposed to many evils, arid 1 fear
abandoned to misfortune; I do not wish to
be rude},but allow me to say, that no misery
can exceed that I shall feel In remaining
h«te, or Indeed in being any where pursued
by the offers'you make me, Adeline had
now forgot her policy: tears prevented her
from proceeding, ana she turned away her
face to hide her emotion.
By Heaven! Adeline, you do me wrong,
said the Marquis, rising from his seat and
seizing her hand; I love, 1 adore you; yet
ycra doub't my passion, and ajc insensible to
iny vowjl Every pleasure possible to he en-
joyed within these walls you shall partake,—,
hut beyopd, thejn you shall not go, 8he
disengaged her'hand, and in silent anguish
walked to a distant part of the saloon: deep
sighs burst ftonyher heart, and almost faint-
fag Ac leaned on a window-frame for sup,
port. *
The Marquis followed her; Why thus
obstinately persist la refusing to be happy?
said he: recollect the proposal 1 have made
you, and 'accept It while it is yet in your
power.' To.murro> a'priest shall join our
lwimhi~~Surciy, being, n\ }oi_ aiv, in my
potfer, it must be ydur inurest to consent to
this? Adeline could .answer oijdy by fairs, $
she despaired of softening his heart, to pity,
and feared to exasperate his pride by disdain.
He now led her, and she suffered .him, ,loa
seat near the banquet, ati which he pressed
her to partake of a variety of confectionarie.'*,
particularly of some liqueurs of which he
himself drank fim-iy; Adeline accepted only
of a peach. , i
And now the Marquis, who interrupted
her silence into a svtrei compliance with his
proposal, resumed all his gaiety and spirit,
while the long and as ,V!H regards he bestowed
on Adeline overcame her with confusion and
indignation. In the *tiikist of the banquet,
soft music again sounded the most tender ant!
impassioned airs; but its effect on Adding
was now lost, her mind being ton much em-
barrassed and distressed by the presence of
the Marquis to admit even th« soothinga of
harmony. A song was now heard, written
with that sort of impotent art by which some
voluptuous poets believe they can at once
conceal and recommend the principles of vice.
Adeline received ft with contempt and dis-
pleasure; and the Marquis perceiving its
effect, presently made a sign lor another
composition, which, adding the force of
poetry to the charms of music, might with-
draw her mind from the present scene, and
endiant it in sweet delirum.

And oft by bards my voice is heard
To die along'the gales of eve.
When the voice ceased, a mournful strain,
played with exquisite expression, sounded
from' a distant horn; sometimes the notes
flouted on the air in soft undulations—now
they swelled into full and sweeping melody,
mid now died faintly into silence, when
again they rose? and trembled in sounds so
sweetly tender, as drew tears from Adeline,
and exclamations of rapture from the Mar-
quis: he threw his arm round her, and
would have pressed her towards him; but
she liberated herself from his embrace, and
with a look, on which was impressed the
firm dignity of virtue, yet touched with sor-
row, she awetl him to forbearance. Conscious
of a superiority which he was ashamed to
acknowledge, and endeavouring to despise
the influence which he could not resist, he
stood for a moment the slave of virtue,
though the votary of vice. Soon, however,
he recovered his confidence, and began to
plead his love; when Adeline, no longer
animated by the spirit she had lately shown,
and sinking beneath the languor and fatigue
which the" various and violent agitations of
her mind produced, entreated he would leave
'her to repose.
The paleness of her countenance and the
^emulous tone" df her voice-were too expres-
sive to be misunderstood; and the Marquis,
bidding her remember to-morrow, with some
'hesitation withdrew. The moment she was
alone she yielded to the bursting anguish
of her heart; and was so absorbed in grief,
that it was some time before she perceived
she was in the presence of the young women
who had lately attended her, and had entered
'the saloon soon after the Marquis quitted it;
'ihey' came to conduct her to her chamber.
She'followed them for some time in silence,
• till, prompted by desperation, she again en-
deavourcd to awaken their compassion: but'
again the praises of the Marquis were re.
: peatedi and perceiving that all attempts to
"Interest' them In her favour were ' in vain
 ;she dismissed ''themv She secured the door
'through which they had' departed, and then,
- ;.in the languid hope- of discovering some
"r' 'mentis of 'escape, she •surveyed' her chamber.
The -airy eleganci with which it mm Stte4
up, and the luxurious accommodations, with
wnich it abounded, seemed designed to-fasci-
nate the imagination and to .seduce the heart
The hangings were of straw«eoloure4 silk,
adorned with a variety of landscape! mi
historical paintings, the subject* of which
partook of the voluptuous character of the
owner; the chimney-piece, of Parian marble,
was ornamented with several reposing figures
from the antique* The bed was of silk, the
colour of the hangings, richly fringed with
purple and silver, and the head made in form
of a canopy. The steps which we*e placed
near the bed to assist in ascending it, wcw
supported by rapids apparently of solid silver.
China vases filled with perfume stood in
several of the recesses, upon stands of the
same structure as the toilet, which was inag-
nificcnt, and ornamented with a variety of
trinkets.
Adeline threw a transient look upon these
various objects, and proceeded to examine
the windows, which descended to the floor
and opened into balconies towards the garden
she had seen from the saloon. They were
now fastened, and her efforts to move them
were ineffectual: at length she gave up the
attempt A door next attracted her nu«.k\\
which she found was not,, fastened; it opened
upon a dressing-closet, to which she descended
by a few steps; two windows appeared, _ slw
hastened towards them; one refused to yield,
but her heart beat with sudden Joy when the
other opened to her touch.
In the transport of the moment, she forgot
that its distance from the ground might yet
deny the escape she meditated. She return d
to lock the door of the closet, to prevent a
surprise, which, however, was unnecessary,
that of the bed-room being already secured.
She now looked out from the window; the
garden lay before her, and she perceived that
the window, which descended to the floor, was
so near the ground, that she might jump f"»:l
it with ease: almost in the same moment
she perceived this, she .sprang forward awl
alighted safely in an extensive garden, re-
sembling more an English pleasure ground,
than a'series of French parterres. . t
Thence she had little doubt of escaping*,
either by some broken fence, or low pari ot
the wall; she tripped lightly along, for f°F
played round her heart The clouds ot the
late storm lyerenow dispersed, and ihe moon-

tated than was that of Adeline: *he signed

along tiic avenue; th«-y continued their flight.
ii«l Adeline, panting for breath, could go no
further.
Having paused a while, and heard no foot-
steps in pursuit, they renewed their course:
Theodore knew that they were now not far

vua ia the iniennodbiie space several p:i*hs
wound from remote pur is of the grounds into
the walk he was to pass, from whence the
JUanpiis\s people might issue- and intercept
him. He, however, concealed his apprehen-
sions from Adeline, and endeavoured to
.soothe and support her spirits.
At length they readied the wall, and Theo-
dore was leading her towards a low part of it,
rear which Mood the carriage,* when again
they heard voices in the dr. Adeline\s spirits
and strength were nearly exhausted, but she

appeared in waiting, but without the driver,
Theodore feared to call, lest his voire should
betray him; he, therefore, put Adeline into
the carriage, and went in search of the postil-
lion, whom he found asleep under a tree at
some distance; haying awakened him, they
returned to the vehicle, which soon drove
furiously away, Adeline did not yet dare to
believe herself safe; hut, after proceeding a
considerable time without interruption, joy
burst upon her heart, and she thanked her
deliverer in terms of the warmest gratitude
The syrnpntb.y expressed in the tone of his
voice and manner, proved that his happiness
on tins occasion, almost equalled her own.
As reflection gradually stole upon her
mind, aaxijty superseded joy: m the tumult
of the hue moments, she thought only of
escape; but the circumstances of her present
situation now appeared to Iter, and she became
silent and pensive: she had no friends to
whom she could fly, and was going with a
young chevalier, almost a stranger to her, she
knew not whither. She remembered how
often she had been deceived and betrayed
where she trusted most, and her spirits sunk;
?-he remembered also the former attention
which Theodore had Known her, and dreaded
lest his conduct might he prompted by »
selfish pjjs'sion. She saw this to be possible,
but she disdained to believe it probable, and
fdt that nothing could give her greater pain
than to doubt the integrity of Theodore,

her late situation at ihe ohoey. You would

treated Adisliiie to alight and take some re-

But the people of the inn were not yet up,
ted it''w«« some time before the knocking and
the roaring of the postillion could rouse them.

Felt the fond pang, and dr oop'd with passion weal,
A knowledge of her destitute condition and
of the dangers with which she was environed,
had awakened in his heart the tenderert touch
of pity, and assisted the change of admiration
into love. The distress he suffered, when
compelled to leave her exposed to these
dangers^ without being able to warn her of
them, can only be imagined. During his resi-
dence with his regiment, his mind wis the
constant prey of terrors, which he saw no
means of combating but. by returning to the
neighbourhood of the abbey where" he might
obtain early intelligence of the MarqmYs
schemes, and be ready to give his assistance
to Adeline.
Leave of absence he could not request,
without betraying his design where most
he dreaded it should be known; and at length
with a generous rashness, which though it
defied law was impelled by virtue, he secretly
twitted his regiment. The progress of the
larquis's plan he had observed with trem-
bling anxiety, till the night that was to,decide
the fate of Adeline and himself roused all his
mind to action, and involved him in a tumult
of hope and fear^ horror and expectation.
Never till the present hour had- he'ven-
tured to believe she was in safety. Mow the
distance they had gained from, the chateau
without perceiving any pursuit, increased his
best hopes. It. was impossible lie could sit
by the side of his beloved Adeline, and recei?e
assurances of her gratitude and esteem, with-
out venturing to hope for her love.' He con-
gratulated himself as her preserver, and anti-
cipate! scenes of happiness when she should
be under the protection of his family. .^Thc
clouds of miiery an.d'.apprehension .disap-
peared from his mind,, and left it to the sun-
shine ©C joy. When a shadow of feat would
iometimes return, or when he 'recollected with
compunction the circumstances under which
he had left hit regiment,, stationed as It was
upon the frontiers, arid in a time of war, he
looked at Adeline* and he? countenance with
Instantaneous magic beamed peace'upon hi*
heart
But Adeline had a .subject of anxiety from
which Hieodore was exempt:.' the project of

fUmecteititf. Agafa;*he was going to claim
tJ»© bounty, of str»nger&-~again gobtg ta en-
counter the uncertahity of their kindness; ex*
potted to the hardship* of dependance, or to
the difficulty of-earning a precarious liveli-
hood. These anticipation* obscured the joy
wcaaioiirf by her escape, And by the affection
which the conduct and avowal of Theodore
bad exhibited. The delicacy of bis behaviour,
In forbearing to take advantage of her present
situation 'to plead hit love, increased her
esteem and fluttered her pride.
Adeline was lost in meditation upon sub-
jects like these* when the postillion stopped
the carriage, and pointing to part of* a road
which wound down the side of a hill they had
passed, said there #er© several horsemen in
pursuit! Theodore immediately ordered him
to proceed with all possible speed, and to
strike out of tlic great road Into the first ob-
scure way that offered. The postillion cracked
his whip in the air, sad set off as if he was
flying lor life. In the meanwhile Theodore
endeavoured to reanimate Adeline, who was
sinking with terror, and who now thought, if
she could only escape fiam the Marquis, she
could defy the future*
Presently they struck into a by lane
screened and overshadowed by thick trees.
Theodore again looked from the window,
but the closing troughs prevented his seeing
fur enough to determine whether the pursuit
continued. For his sake Adeline endeavoured
to disguise her emotions. This lane, Raid
Theodore, will certainly lead to a town or vil-
lage, and then we have nothing to apprehend:
for, though my single arm could not defend
you against the number of out pursuers, I
nave no doubt of being Able in interest some
Of the inhabitants in our behalf.
Adeline appeared to be comforted by the
hope this reflection suggested: arid Theodore
•gain looked buck: but the windings of the
toad closed his flew, and the rattling of the
wheels overcame every other sound. At
length he called to the postillion to stop; and
having listened attentively without perceiving
mf sound of horses, he began to hope they
were now Ift safety* Do you know whither
this road leads? said he- The postillion an*
tweted that 'he did not, but he tew some houses
through the toees at a distance, and believed
that it led to them. This was most welcome
intelligence to Theodore, who looked fat ward
mi perceived the houses. The postillion set
off* W&it nothing, my adoted Adeline, said
he, you me now safe'; 1 will part with you
but with life." Adeline sighed, riot for her-
self only, but for the danger to which Theo-
dore might be exposed.-
They had continued to travel in this man*
net fat near half an lour, whet? they arrived
it 4'tmiall vHlage, mi stwa after stopped at
iwi inn, the,best the place al|ti«ktl. , Ah,The-
odore lifted Adeline frOtb the r|i!iit'f>f!f"Wl',,teiiiti
entreated her- to dismiss, her' &ppretyTi»io'rU,
ant! spoke with ,a tenderness'to, which''she
could reply only by n smile that ill 'toikesilad
her anilely. After ordering- r<;r>cshinerilft, be
went out to speak with Uie landlord';''ttitrtad
scarcely left the room when Adding bhserved
it party of horsemen tiifttr the inn' jhtit and
she had .no.doubt fhu>e were flie- persons
from whom tliey fled.. The fh'ctes oftwo. of
them only were turned towards n?r, but "she
thought the figure of one of tlie Others hblun*
like that of the JMarmiis.
Her heart was chilled, imd' fat some lno-
ments the powers m reason forsook'Iter. Ijer
first design was to seek concealment: 'but
while she considered the means, one of the
horsemen looked up to the window neat which
she stood, untl speaking to Ms companions
thew entered the inn. 'To iuit the room
without being observed was impossible i to
remain there, alone and unprotected as she
was, would almost be equally dangerous, ^he
paced the room in an agony of tew or, often
secretly calling on Theodore, and often Won-
dcring lie did not return. These were mo-
ments of indescribable suffering. A. loud
and tumultuous sound of voices now arose
front a distant part of the house, and she soon
distinguished uic words of the disputants, 1
arrest you in tlie king's name, said onef ,and
bid you, at your peril, attempt to go fjrom
hence, except under a guard. '''
Tlie next minute Adeline beard the ?oic«
f>f Theodore in reply. I do not mean "to":dli»
pute the king*g orders, said he, and give yon
my word of honour not to go without'you; but
first unhand me, that I may return to that
loom | 1 have a friend there whom 1 wf§b to

objected, considering It merely as art excuse
to obtain an opportunity of escaping; but

With art eager hand he unclosed tit door;

bad feinted almost at the begimtfng' of the

The Mian already exasperated by the opposi-

his speech as a threat, and became determined
not to'give up flic point: he pressed forward;
and white his comrade called the men from
the yard, Theodore wounded him slightly in
the shoulder, awl received himself the stroke
of a sabre oh fill head.
The', blood gushed furiously from the
wound* Theodore, staggering to a chair,
sunk into it, Just as the remainder of the
party "entered the room; and Adeline un-
closed her eyes to See him ghastly pale, and
covered with blood. She uttered an invo-
luntary scream, and exclaiming, They have
murdered 'him, nearly relapsed. At the
bound ' of her' voice he raised his head, and
smiling held out his hand to her. 1 am not
much hurt said he faintly, and shall soon be
better, if indeed you are recovered. She has-
tened towards him, and gave her hand. Is no-
body gone for a surgeon? said she with a look
of agony. Bo'not he, alarmed, said Theodore,

Having examined the wound, he declined

fore^to consider the consequences. He has
received a very dangerous wound, which re-
quires the most careful treatment, and the
event is even then doubtful; but if he travels,
a fever may ensue, and the wound will then
be mortal. Theodore heard this sentence
with composure, but Adeline could with diffi-
culty conceal the anguish of her heart: slit
roused all her fortitude to suppress the tear**
that struggled in her eyes; and though she
wished to interest the humanity or to awaken
the fears of the men in behalf of their unfor-
tunate prisoner, she dared not to trust hex
voice with utterance.
From thin internal struggle she was re-
lieved by the compassion of the people who
filled the room, and becoming clamorous in
the cause of Theodore, declared the officers
would be guilty of murder if they removed
him. Why he must, die at any rate, said the
sergeant, for quitting his post, and drawing
upon me in the execution of the king's orders,
A faint sickness seized the heart or Adeline,
and she leaned for support against Theodore's
chair, whose concern for himself was for a
while suspended in his anxiety for her. He
supported her with Ms arm, and forcing
a smile, said in a low voice, which she only
could hear, This is a misrepresentation; J
doubt not, when the affair, is inquired into,
it will be settled without any serious conse-
quences.
Adeline knew these words were uttered
only to console her, and therefore did not
give much credit to them, though Theodore
continued .to give her similar assurances of his
safety. Meanwhile the mob, whose compas-
sion .for him had been gradually, excited by
the obduracy of the officer, were now roused
to^pity and indignation by the seeming cer-
tainty of his punishment, and the unfeeling
manner in which it had been denounced. In
a short time they became so much enraged 
that, partly from a dread of further conse-
quences, and partly from the shame which
their charges of cruelty occasioned, the ser-
geant consented that lit should be put to bed,
till his commanding-officer might direct what
was to be done. Adelines joy at this cir-
cumstance overcame for a moment the sense
of her misfortunes and of her situation.
She waited in an adjoining room the sen-
tence of the surgeon, who was now engaged
in examining the wound; and though the ac-
cident would in any other circumstances
have severely afflicted her* she now lamented
it the more, because she considered herself
as the cause of it, and because the misfortune
by illustrating more fully the affection of her
lover, .drew him closer to her heart, and'
seemed therefore to sharpen the poignancy of
her affliction.- „ The dreadful- assertion that
Theodore, should he reco?©rt would, be pu»

awakened all her tenderness, and discovered
to her the true state of her affections. The
graceful form, the noble, intelligent, counte-
nance, And the engaging manners which she
had at first admiral in Theodore, became af-
terwards more interesting by that strength of
thought and elegance of sentiment exhibited
in his conversation. His conduct, since her
t scape, had excited her wannest gratitude;
and the clanger which he had now encoun-
tered In her behalf, called forth hex tender*
m*s, and heightened it into love. The veil
was removed from her heart, and §be saw for
the first time its genuine emotions.
The surgeon at length came out of Theo-
dore's chamber into the room wher« Adeline
was waiting to speak with him. She inquired
concerning the state of his wound. Yon are
a relation of the gentleman's, I presume,
Madam; bis raster, perhaps? The question
vexed and embarrassed her, and without
answering it she repeated her inquiry. Per-
haps, Madam, you are more nearly related,
pursued the surgeon, seeming also to dis-
regard her question,—.perhaps you arc his
wife? 'Adeline blushed, and was about to
reply, but he continued his speech. The
interest you take in hie welfare if at least
very flattering, and 1 would almost consent to
exchange conditions with him, were 1 sure
of receiving sueh tender compassion from so
charming a lady. Baying this, lie bowed to
the ground. Adeline assuming a very re-
served air, said, Now, Sir, that you have
concluded your compliment, you will perhaps
attend to my question; I have inquired how
you have left your patient
f That, Madam, is perhaps a question very
difficult to be resolved; and it is likewise a
very disagreeable office to pronounce ill news
—-I fear he will die.' The surgeon opened
his snuff-box and preseneed it to Adeline*
Hie! she exclaimed In a faint voice, die f
l>o not be alarmed, Madam, resumed the
surgeon,- observing her grow pale, do not be*
alarmed. It is possible that the wound may
not have reached the-*~*-, he stammered, in
that case the—, stammering again, is not
affected; and if so, the interior membranes of
the brain are not touched j In this case the
wound may perhaps escape inflammation,
and the patient'may possibly recover. But
if, on the other hand—
I beseech you, Hit, to speak intelligibly,
interrupted Adeline, and not to trifle with my
anxiety. Bo you really believe him in
danger?  '
lo danger^ Madam, exclaimed the surgeon,
"m danger!- yea, certainly, in very great. ,
danger." haying tills, he walked away with .
an air of chagrin and displeasure* Adding ..
remained for some moments in the room,., in..
an exc«s ©f sorrow', which she found it im-
possible to restrain; and then drying., hex .
tears, and endeavouring to compose her coun-
tenance, she went to inquire for the tijfiatress.
of the inn, to nhom she sent a waiter. After
expecting her in vain fur some time, .she
rang the bell, and sent another message some*
what more pressing. Still the hostess did
not appear; and Adeline at length '.went her-
self down stairs, where she found her, mr.
rounded by a number of people, relating,
with s loud voice and. various gesticulations,
the particulars of the late accident. Per-
ceiving Adeline, she called out, Oh 1 here Is
Mademoiselle herself; and the eyes of the
assembly were immediately turned upon her.
Adeline, whom the crowd prevented from
approaching the hostess, now beckoned her,
and was going to withdraw; but the bind-
lady, eager in the pursuit of her story, disre-
garded the signal. In vain did Adeline
endeavour to catch her eye; it glanced every
where but upon her, who was unwilling to
attract the further notice of the crowd by
calling out.
It is a great pity, to be sure, that he.should,
lie shot, said the landlady, he's such a fiand-,.
some man; but they say he certainly will.'if
he recovers. Poor gentleman! he- will very
likely not suffer though, fyr Ac doctor says
he will never go out ttf this bouse alive.
Adeline now spoke to a man who stood ne*r4.
and desiring he would tell the hostess she,
wished to speak with her, left 4he place.: ,'
In about ten minutes the landlady, ap-,
peared. Alas! Mademoiselle, .naici she, youi

her in the boat manner she-was able. She
vdvised her to scad for her friend*, and
offered to procure a messenger. 'Adeline

nnd besides, who is to pay for his funeral If

silent;' and desiring that every proper atten-
tion might bo given, she promised her a
reward for her trouble, and requested pen and
: Ink immediately* Ay, to be sure, Ma'mselle,

was obliged to repeat her request for pen and
ink, before the loquacious hostess would quit
the room.
The thought of sending for Theodore's
friends had, in the tumult of the late scenes,
never occurred to her, and she was now some-
what consoled by the prospect of comfort
which it opened for him. When the pen
and ink were brought, she wrote the following
note to Theodore ;—
"In your present condition, yon haYeneed

I do not like him, said 'Adeline • but tell
me how you find yourself? He assured
her that - he was now much easier than
he had yet been; and mentioning her kind
note, he led to the subject oh -account of
which he had solicited to see her. My family,
•aid he, reside at a great distance from hence,
and 1 well know their affection in such, that,
were they informed of my situation, no con.
sideration, however reasonable, could prevent
their coming to my assistance: but before
they can arrive, their presence will probably
be unnecessary (Adeline looked earnestly at
him.) I should probably be well, pursued
he, smiling, before a letter could reach them;
it would, therefore^ occasion them unneces-
sary pain, and moreover a fruitless journey.
For your sake, Adeline, 1 Could wish they
were here; but a few' clays will more fully
show the consequences of my Hound? let us
wait at least till then, and be directed bj
circumstances.
Adeline forbore to press the subject further,
and turned to one more immediately interest-
ing. I much wish, Said she, that you had a
more able surgeon; you know the geography
of the province better than 1 do; are we in
the neighbourhood of any town likely to
afford you other advice?
1 believe not, said he; and this is an affair
of little consequence, for my wound is so
Inconsiderable that a very moderate share of
ikill may suffice to cure it. But why, ray
beloved Adeline, do you give way to this
anxiety? why suffer yourself to be disturbed
by this tendency to forebode the worst? 1 am
willing, perhaps presumptuously so, to attri-
bute it to your kindness; and suffer me to
assure you, that while it excites mj gratitude,
it increases my tendercst esteem, O Adeline!
gince you wish my speedy recovery, let roe
see you composed; while I believe you to be
unhappy 1 cannot be well.—She assured him
she would endeavour to be at least tranquil;
and fearing the conversation, if "prolonged,
would be prejudicial to him, she left him to
repose.
As she turned out of the gallery she met
the hostess, upon ^vhom certain words of
Adeline had operated as a talisman, trans-
forming neglect an4 impertinence into offici-
ous civility. She came to inquire whether
the gentleman above 'stairs had every thing
that he liked, for she was" sure it, was her
endeavour that he 'should.' I have got him a
nurse, Ma'mselle, to attend'him, and!, dare
iay she will do very; well; but I will look to
that, for "I shall not' mind helping him my-
self sometimes* 'Poor gentleman I how, pa-
tiently he bears it! ', One would not'', think
_ now that he believes he is going 'to die;, yet
'the 'doctor told him so himself,' or at least as
good.' Adeline was extremely shocked at
• Slit imprudent conduct of'the surgeon,'and

ManmmA the landlady, after ordering a slight
dinner.
Towards evening the surgeon again made
hi* appearance; and having posted some time
with his patient, returned to the parlour,
according to the desire of Adeline, to inform
her of his' condition, lit* answered Adeline's
inquiries with great solemnity. It is impos-
sible to determine positively at present,
Madam, but I have reason to adhere to the
opinion 1 gave you this morning. 1 am not
apt Indeed, to form opinions upon uncertain
grounds—I will give you a singular instance
of tins:
It is not above a fortnight since 1 was sent
for to a patient at some leagues distance; 1
was from home when the' messenger arrived,
and the case being urgent, before 1 could
reach the patient another physician was con-
sulted, who had ordered such medicines m lie
thought proper, and the patient had been
apparently relieved by them. Ilia friends
were congratulating themselves upon his im.
provenient when 1 arrived, and had agreed in
opinion with tlie physician that there was no
danger in his case. Depend upon it, said I,
you are mistaken; these medicines cannot
have relieved him; the patient is in the utmost
danger. The patient groaned; but my bro-
ther physician persisted in affirming that the
remedies he had prescribed would not only be
certain, but speedy, some good effect having
been already produced by them. Upon this
1 lost all patience; and adhering to ray
opinion, that these effects were fallacious ana
the ease desperate, I assured the patient him-
self tiiat his life was in the utmost danger.
1 am not one of those, Madam, who deceive
their patients to the last moment;—but you
shall hear the conclusion.
My brother physician was,. 1 suppose,
enraged by the firmness of my opposition,
for he assumed a most angry look, which did
not in the least affect me, and turning to the
patient, desired he would decide upon which
of our opinions tp rely, for he must decline
acting with me. The patient did me the
honour, pursued the surgeon with a smile of
complacency and smoothing his ruffles, to
think more highly of me than, perhaps, 1
deserved, for lie immediately dismissed my
opponent, 1 could not have believed, said
he, as the physician left the room—I could
mot have believed that a man who has bees
so many years in the profession could he so
wholly ignorant of it
1 could not hate believed it either, said I,—.
1 am astonished that he was not aware of my
danger, resumed the patient I am astonished
likewise, replied I, 1 was resolved to do
what f could for the patient, for he was a man
of understanding, m yon perceive, and -i had
';u regard for him. I' therefore altered the
prescriptknis^ and myself adminUtited the
medicines; but Ail would wit doy»~my opi-
nion was verified, and he died even before the
next morniitg.«—Adtline, who had been com*
pelled to listen to this long' story, sighed; at
the conclusion of it.  1 do»%.w©tfdef"';tb»t
you are affected, Madam,'said the surgeon;
the instance I have related is* certainty «'very
affecting one* It distressed me 'so much,
that it was some time before I could tb'imVar
even speak concerning it* But you' tout
allow, Madam, continued he, lowering his
voice and bowing with a look of self-congtm-
tulation, that this was- a striking instance of
the infallibility of my judgment*
Adeline shuddered at the infallibility of
his judgment, and made no reply. It was a
shocking thing for the poor man, resumed-the
surgeon.—It was indeed, very shocking,- said
Adeline*—! t affected me a good deal when it
happened, continued 'he.—•Undoubtedly, Sir,
said Adeline*
But time wears away the most painful
impressions.  •
1 think you mention it was about a fort-
night since this happened?
Somewhere thereabouts, replied the surgeon
without seeming to understand the observa-
tion.—«And will you permit me, Sir, to ask the
name of the physician who so jgnorantly
opposed you?
Certainly, Madame; it is Lafarwe.
He lives in the obscurity he deserves^ ff© _
doubt, said Adeline.
Why no, Madam, he lives in a1 town of
some note, at about the distance' of four
leagues from hence ; and afford* one Instance,
among many others, that the public opinion
is generally erroneous. - 'You ' will hardly
believe it, but 1 assure you it is a (act, that
this man comes into a great deal of practice,
while I am suffered to ^main-here neglected,
and, indeed very little known*
During his na»ati¥e Adeline had" been
considering by what means she could discover-
the name of the physician; for the instance
that had been produced to prove Ms igfmr&n^

'raljjr ask for drink, but it mutit on no account
be.jpTen to him.
Yon do not approve then of the method
which 1 have somewherfe heard of, said Ade-
line, of attending to nature in these cases?
jNature, Madam I pursued he, natww k ,.thc
"roogi improper guide in the world: 1 always
'adopt a method directly contrary to what she
would' suggest; fcr what can be the use of
art, if ftlie is only to follow nature? This
was my first opinion on sotting out in life,
apd I have ever since strictly adhered to it.
From what I ha?e said, indeed, Madam, you
may perhaps perceive that iny opinions may
be depended on; what they once are they
always tie, for my mind is not of that frivolous .
kind to he affected by, circumstances.
Adeline was fatigued by this discourse,
and impatient to impart to Theodore her
discovery of a physician: but the surgeon
teemed by no means disposed to leave her,
and was expatiating upon various topics, with
new instances of his surprising sagacity, when
, the mraiter brought a, message that some person
desired to see him. He was, however, en-
gaged upon too agreeable a topic to be easily
| prevailed upon to quit it, and it was^not till
after a second message was brought that he
made his bow to Adeline and left the room.
"The moment he was gone she sent a note to
Theodore, entreating his, permission to call
In the assistance of the physician*
The conceited manners of the surgeon had
,'by this time given Theodore a very unfavour-
able opinion of his talents, and the last pre-
scription had so full? confirmed it,, that he
now, readily consented to have other advice,
.Adeline immediately inquired for a mes-
senger; but recollecting that the residence of
. _ the physician was still a secret, she applied to
the hostess, who being really ignorant of it,
. or pretending to be so, gave her no informa-
tion. 'What further inquiries she made were
equally ineffectual, and she passed some
hours in extreme distress, while the disorder
of Theodore rather increased than abated.
'i When supper appeared, she asked the boy
who waited if he knew a physician of the
'name, of Lafance in the neighbourhood. Not
: in- the neighbourhood, Madame; but 1 know
doctor Lafance of Ohancy, for I coma from
the town—--Adeline inquired further, and re-
ceived mry satisfactory answers. But the
town was at some Itagues distance, and the
delay this circumstance must occasion again
alarmed her; she, however, ordered a mes-
senger to be immediately dispatched, and
'hiving sent again to inquire concerning Theo-
dore, retired to her chamber for the night.
The continued fatigue shejbad suffered for
'", the last'fourteen' hours overcame anxiety, and
"\'hafharassed spirits sunk, to, repose. ' She
';*lBjkt.,tSll'.late, in the mornings and was then
''avr'afceried by the landlady, who came to inform
her that Theodore was much worse, and to in-
quire what should be done. Adeline, findiusc
that the physician wan not arrived, immcdil
ately arose, and hastened to inquire furchcr
concerning Theodore* The hosier informed
her that he had passed a very disturbed night •
that he had complained of being very hot,
and desired that the fire in his room might
be extinguished; but that the nurse knew
her duty too well to obey him, and had
strictly followed the doctor's orders.
She added, that he had taken the cordial
draughts regularly, but had, not withstand tug,
continued to grow worse, and at last became
light-headed. In the mean time the boy who
had been sent for the phyniciaa wag still ab-
sent:—And no wonder, continued the hos-
tess; why, only consider, it's eight leagues
off, and the lad had to find the road, bad as
it is, in the dark. But indeed, Ma'vnscllc,
you might as well have trusted our doctor,
for we never want any body else, not we, in
the town here; and if 1 might speak my
mind, Jaques had better have been sent off
.for the young gentleman's friends than for
this strange doctor that nobody knows.
After asking some further questions con-
cerning Theodore, the answers to- which
rather increased than diminished her alarm,
Adeline endeavoured to compose her spirits,
and await in patience the arrival of* the phy-
sician. She was now more, sensible than ever
of the forlornness of her own condition, arid
of the danger of Theodore's, and earnestly
wished that his friends could be informed of
his situation; a wish which could not be
gratified, for Theodore, who alone cow id
acquaint her with their place of resideneef
was deprived of recollection.
When the surgeon arrived and perceived
the situation of his patient, he expressed no
surprise j but having .asked some questions
and given a few general directions, he we.it
down to Adeline. After paying her his usual
compliments, he suddenly assumed an air of
importance*—I am sorry Madam, said he,
that it is my office to communicate dis-
agreeable intelligence, but I wish you to be
prepared for the event, which , 1 fear, is
approaching. Adeline comprehended his
meaning; and though she had hitherto given
little faith to his judgment, she could not hear
hhii hint at the immediate danger ^i Theo-
dore without yielding to the influence of fear.
She entreated him to acquaint her; with all
he apprehended: and he then proceeded to
say that Theodore was, as he had foreseen,
much worse this morning than he had been
the preceding night; and the disorder having
"now affected his head, there was every reason
to fear it would prove; fatal in _ a few %>«rs.
The worst consequences may ensue, continued
he; if the wound becomes inflamed, there
will be very little chance of his recovery.

Adeline listened to this sentence with a
dreadful calmness, and gave fi© utterance to
grief, either by wmi§ or team. The gentle-
man, I suppose, Madam, has friends, and the
ftooncr ym inform them of his condition the
better. If they reside at any distance, k k
indeed too late; but there are other necessary
-—You are ill, Madam I
Adeline made an effort to speak, but in
vain, and the surgeon now called loudly for
a glass of water; she drank it, and a deep
sigh that she uttered, seemed somewhat to
relieve her oppressed heart: tears succeeded.
In the mean time the surgeon perceiving she
was better, though not well enough to listen
to his convewatien, took leave, and promised
to return in an hour. The physician was not
yet arrived, and Adeline awaited his appear-
ance with a mixture of fear and anxious hope.
About noon he came; and having been in-
formed of the accident by which the fever was
produced, and of tb# treatment which the
surgeon had given it, he ascended to Theo-
dore's chamber. In a' quarter of an hour he
returned to the room where Adeline expected
him: The gentleman is still delirious, said
he, but I have ordered him a composing
draught*-—--.Is there any hope, Sir? inquired
Adeline. Yes, Madam, certainly there is
hope; the case at present is somewhat doubt*
ful, but a few hours may enable me to judge
with more certainty: in the mean time, I
have directed that he shall be kept quiet, arid
lie allowed to drink freely of some diluting
 liquids.
He had scarcely, at Adeline's request,
recommended a surgeon, instead of the one
at present employed, when the latter gentle-
ruin entered the room, and perceiving the
physician, threw a glance of mingled surprise
 and anger at Adeline, who retired with him
to another apartment, where she dismissed
him with a politeness which he did not deign
to return, and which he certainly did not
deserve.
Early the following morning the surgeon
"arrived; but either the medicines or the
erisis of the disorder had thrown Theodore
into a deep sleep, in which he remained for
several hoars. The physician now gave
Adeline reason io hope for a favourable issue,
and every precaution was taken to prevent his
being disturbed. He awoke perfectly sen-
si We and free from fever; ar.d his first words
inquired for Adeline, who soon learned that
he was out of danger.
In a few days he was sufficiently recovered
to be removed from his chamber to a room
adjoining, where Adeline met him with a
joy which she found it impossible to repress;
and the observance of thia/1 rented itp his
countenance with pleasure: indeed Adeline,
sensible to the, attachment he had go nobly
testified,' and softened by the danger he had
encountered, no longer attempted to (ti&gubc
the tenderness of her esteem, and' .Waa at
length brought to confess the interest his first
appearance had impressed upon her heart*
After an hour of affecting conversation, in
which the happiness of a young anil miitual
attachment totally occupied their niiftas, and
excluded every idea not in unison With de-
light, they returned to a sense of their pre-
sent embarrassments. Adeline recollected that
Theodore was arrested for disobedience of
orders, and deserting his post; and Theodore,
that he must shortly be torn away from Ade-
line, who would be left exposed to all the
evils from which lie had so lately rescued her.
This thought overwhelmed his heart with
anguish; and after a long pause he''ventured
to propose what his wishes had often 'sug-
gested—a marriage with Adeline before lie
departed from the Tillage: this was'the only
means of preventing, perhaps, an eternal
separation; and though he saw the many
dangerous inconveniences to which she would
be exposed by a ruarriags with '"a man1 cir-
cumstanced like himself, yet thei»e appeared
so unequal to those she would otherwise be
left to encounter alone, that his reason could
no longer scruple to adopt what his affection
had suggested. ";
Adeline was for some time too 'much agi-
tated to reply: and though she had little, to
oppose to the arguments and pleadings i of
Theodore; though she had no frielids to con-
trol, and no contrariety of interests, to perplex
her, she could'not bring herself io/consent
thus hastily to a marriage with 4 iiiaff of
whom she had little knowledge, and to whoso
family and connexions she had'no sbrt of ''in-
troduction. At length she 'entreated' he
would drop the subject; and the conversation
for the remainder ox the day was mote general,
yet still interesting.
That similarity o( taste and bp2hV>n which
had at first attracted' them,_ every itibment
now more fully disclosed. '"'Their'discourse
was enriched by elegant literature, Arid en-
deared 'by mutual regard. 'Adeline had enjoyed
few opportunities or reading; but the' books
to which she had access, o|>cristfng upon a
mind eager for knowledge, and'upoa.it'taste-
peculiarly sensible of the beautiful and the
elegant, had impressed all their excellences
upon her understanding. Theodore, had re-
ceived frokn' nature many of the qualities

could bestow; to these were added a noble

from which Adeline immediately withdrew,
in formed him with an ait of infinite import-
ance' that' lie should set out on the following
day for Ifcad-quarters. Theodore answered
that he was not able to hear the journey, and
referred him to his physician t hut the officer
replied th.it he should take no such trouble,
it being curtain that the physician might be
instructed irhat to say, and that he should
begin his journey ©a the morrow. Hew has
been delay enough, said he, already; and you
will have sufficient business on jour hands
when you peach head-quarters; for the ser-
geant whom you have severely wounded in-
tends to appear against you; and this, with
the offence you have committed by deserting
your post~-~^~»
Theodore's eyes flashed fire: Deserting!
said he, rising from his seat and darting a
look of menace at his accuser—who dares to
brand me with the name of deserter? But
instantly recollecting how much his conduct
had appeared to justify the accusation, he
endeavoured to stifle hi» emotions; and with
a inn voice and composed manner said, that
when he reached heact quarters he should be
ready to answer whatever might be brought
against him, but that till then he should be
silent. The boldness of the officer was re-
pressed by the spirit and dignity with which
Theodore spoke these words, and muttering
m reply that was scarcely audible, he left the
roOm.
Theodore sat musing on the danger of his
situation: he knew that he had much to
apprehend from the peculiar circumstance*
attending his abrupt departure from his regi-
ment, it liaving been stationed fa a garrison
town upon the Spanish frontiers, where the
discipline was very severe, and from the
power of his colonel, the Marquis'dcMontalt,
whom pride and disappointment would now
rouse to vengeance, and, probably render in-
defatigable hi the accomplishment of his
destruction. But his thoughts soon fled from
his own clanger to that of Adeline; and in
the consideration of this, all his fortitude
forsook him: he could not support the idea
of leaf! ng her exposed to the evils he fore-
boded, nor, indeed, of a separation so sudden
mi that which now threatened him: and when
she again entered the room, he renewed his
solicitations for" a speedy marriage* with all
the arguments that terideiffiesg and,, ifigtauity
could suggest' . .
Adeline, when she teamed that .'fee1 was to
depart on the morrow, felt as If befeaved of
her last comfort: all the horrors of his situa*
tion arose to he* mind, and she tutted ftom
him' in unutterable anguish.. Considering
her; silence m a favourable presage, he re-
pMed'" his entreaties that she would consent
to*behl% and'thus 'glw htm 'a surety fhat
thotr ''separattorf :§Jioiaa not be eternal. Ade-
line sighed deeply to these wordf t And wlw
can know that our separation wIE mid be
eternal, said she, even if 1 could consent to
the marriage you propose? But while you
hear my determination, forbear to accuse aw
of indifference; lot indifference towards you
would indeed be a crim% altar the services
you have rendered me.
And is a cold sentiment of gratitude all that
1 must expect from you? §aid Theodore. 1
know that you are going to distress me with
a proof of your indifference, which you mis-
take for the suggestions of prudence; and
that I shall be compelled to look without
reluctance upon the evils that may shortly
await me. Ah, Adeline! if you mean to
reject this, perhape the last proposal which I
can ever mate to yout cease at least to deceive
yourself with an idea that you love me—
that delirium is fading even from my mind.
Can you then m soon fo%et our eonvewa*
tion of this morning? leplied Adeline; and
can you think so lightly of me as to believe 1
would profess a regard which I do not reel?
If indeed you can believe this, 1 shall do well
to forget that 1 ever made such an acknow-
ledgement, and you that you heard it.
Forgive me, Adeline, forgive the doubts
and inconsistencies I have betrayed t let the
anxieties of love, and the emergency of my
circumstances, plead for me. Adeline, smil-
ing faintly through her tears, held out her
hand, which he seized and pressed to his
lips. Yel 'do not drive me to despair by a
rejection of my suit, continued Theodore;
think what I must suffer to leave you here
destitute of friends and protection.
 1 am thinking how I may avoid a situation
so deplorable, said Adeline. They say there
is a convent which receives boarders, within
a few miles, and thither ! wish to go,
A convent! rejoined Theodore; would you
go to a convent? Do you know the persecu-
tions you would be liable to; and that if the
Marquis should discover you, there is little
probability the superior would resist his
authority, or at least his bribes?
All this I have considered, said Adeline,
and am prepared to encounter it, rather than
enter into an engagement which at this time
can be productive only of misery to us both.
Ah, Adeline! could you think thus, if you
truly loved? I see myself about to be sepa-
rated, and that perhaps for ever, from the
object of my tenderest affections 5 and 1 can-
not but express all the anguish 1 feel—I
cannot forbear to repeat every argument that
may afford even the slightest possibility of
altering your determination;. But yoti, Ade-
line, ym look with complacency upon a cir-
cumstance which tortures me with despair,

wiiicli the pleadings of her heart powerfully
opposed, was unable longer to command her
distress, awl burst into teats. Theodore was
in the same moment convinced of his error,
and shocked at the grief he had occasioned*
lie drew his chair towards her, and talcing
her hand, again entreated her pardon, and
endeavoured in the tenderest accents to soothe
and comfort her.*—What a wretch was 1 to
cause you. this distress, by questioning that
regard with which 1 can no longer doubt you
honour me! Forgive me, Adeline; say but
you forgive me, and whatever miay be the
pain of this separation, i wiE no longer
oppose it.
Yon hate given me some pain, said Ade-
line, but yoa have not offended me«~~&he
then mentioned some further particulars con-
cerning the con vest. Theodore endeavoured
to conceal the diitress which the approaching
Reparation occasioned him, and to consult
with her on these plans with composure*
f f Is judgment by -degrees prevailed oyer his
passions, and he n#w perceived that the plan
she suggested, would afford her best, chance
of security* He considered, what in the first
agitation of his mind had escaped him, that
he might be condemned upon the charges
brought against him, and that his death,
should they have been married, would not
only deprive her of her protector, but leave
her more immediately exposed to the designs
of the Marquis, who would doubtless, attend
his trial* Astonished that he bad not noticed
this before, and shocked at the unwariness by
which he might have betrayed her into so
dangerous a situation, he became at once re-
conciled to the idea of leaving her in a convent.
He could have wished to place her in the
asylum of his own family; but the circum-
stances under which she must be introduced
were so awkward and painful, and above all,
the distance at which they resided would
render a journey so highly dangerous for her,
that he forbore to propose it. He entreated
only that she would allow him to write to
her; hut recollecting that his letters might
fee a means of betraying the place of her
residence to the Marquis, lie checked himself;
1 mast deny myself even this melancholy
pleasure^ said he, lest my letters should dis-
cover your abode; yet how shal I be able to
endure the impatience and uncertainty to
which prudence condemns me I li you are
in danger, 1 shall be ignorant of it; though,
indeed, did 1 know it, said he with a look
of despair,, 1 could not fly to save you. 0
eatquiaite misery! 'tis now only I perceive all
the , horrors of confinement—'tis now only
that I understand all the value of libeity.

lent agitation of Ms mind; he arose tmm his

countenance, threw tiimstff into a chair by
hers, and taking her hand,'attempted to' speak
comfort to her; but the w^rds faltered on his
lips, and he could cnly'hfthe her hand with
leap.
This-mournful silence, was interrupted by
. the arrival of the carriage at the inn, and
Theodore, arising, went to the window that
opened into the yard* The darfoicss of the
night prevented his distlnguiibfaig the object*
without, but a light eow brought'from the
house showed him a carriage and four, at-
tended by several servants. Tryesentiy he saw
a gentleman, wrapped up in a roquelaure,
alight and enter the inn, and in the next
moment he heawl the voiee of the Marquis.
He had Iowa to support Adeline, who was
sinking with terror, when the door opened,
and the Marquia followed by the officers Mid
several servant* entered. Fury flashed from
his eyes as they glanced upon Theodore, who
hung over Adeline with a look of fearful soli-
citwde—Seke that traitor, said he, turning to ,
the officers; why have yon suffered him to'
remain here so long?
I am no traitor, said Theodore with a firm
voice and the dignity of conscious worth, but
a defender of innocence, of one whom the
treacherous Marquia deMontalt would destroy.
Obey your orders, laid the Marquis to the
officers. Adeline shrieked, held faster by
Theodore's arm, and entreated the men not
to part them. Force only can effect it, said
Theodore, as he looked round for some in«
strument of defence; but he could see none,
and in the same moment they surrounded and
seized him. Bread every thing from. my
vengeance, said the Marquis to Theodore, as
he caught the hand of Adeline, who had lost
all power. of, resistance and was scarcely
sensible of what pasted; dread every thing

THE ROMANCE OF THE FOREST.
 
and with tears ot agony implored compassion
for Theodore; but her pleadings for his rival
serf eel only to irritate' the pride and exasperate
the hatred of the Marquis. He denounced
vengeance on his head, and imprecations too
dreadful for the spirits of Adeline, whom he
compelled to rise4 and then endeavouring to
'utile die emotions of rage, which the presence
©1 Theodore had excited, he began to address
her with his usual expressions of admiration.
The wretched, Adeline, who, regardless of
what he said, still endeavoured to plead for
her unhappy lover, was at -length alarmed by
'the returning rage which 'the countenance -of
the Marquis expressed; and exerting all her
remaining strength, she -sprung from his
grqsp towards the door 'of the room; but he
seized her hand before she could reach it, and
regardless of her shrieks, bringing her back
to her chair, "was going to speak, when voices
were heard in the passage, and immediately
the landlord and his wife,'whom Adelines
cries had alarmed, entered the apartment,
'The Marquis, turning furiously at them,
demanded what they wanted; but not waiting
'.*For an-answer, he1'bade them attend him, and
quitting the rocte, she heard the 4&m locked
upon her.
Adeline now an to the windows, which
were unfastened  and opened' into' the inn-
'. yard. All wis dark and .silent. She called
i iloud for help, but jio person appeared; and
. the windows.were m high that it was impos-
• ntble to escape unassisted. She walked about
'the room in'an agony of terror and distress,
.; now stooping to listen, and fancying she
beard voices disputing below and now quick-
82
ening her steps, as suspense increased the
agitation of her mind.
She had continued in this state for near
half an hour, when she suddenly heard a
violent noise in the lower part of the house,
which increased till all was uproar and con-
fusion. People passed quickly through the
passages, and doors were frequently opened
and shut. She called, but received no answer.
It immediately occurred toller that Theodore,
having heard her screams, had attempted to
come toiler assistance, and that the bustle
'had been occasioned by the opposition of the
officers. Knowing their fierceness and cruelty,
-she was seized with dreadful apprehensions
for the -life of Theodore.
A confused uproar of voices now sounded
from below, and the .screams of women con-
vinced her there was fighting; she even
thought she heard the clashing of swords:
'the image of "Theodore dying by the hands of
'the Marquis now .rose to.her imagination,
and the terrors 'of suspense became almost
Insupportable. She made a desperate effort
to force the door, and again called for help;
but her'trembling hands were powerless, and
every person in the house seemed to be too
much engaged even to hear her. A loud
shriek now pierced her ears, and amidst the
tumult that followed she clearly distinguished
deep groans. This confirmation of her fears
deprived her of all her remaining spirits, and
growing faint, she sunk almost lifeless into a
chair near the door. The uproar gradually
subsided till all was still, but nobody returned
to her. Sooji after she heard, voices in the
yard, but she had no power to walk'acre®
rs
 
the rodfti,., even to ask the questions she
wished, yet feared, to have answered.
About a quarter of an hour elapsed, when
tlie door was unlocked, and' the hostess ap-
peared with a countenance as pale m death.
For Clod's s»kc, said Adeline, tell me what
has happened? Is he wounded? Is he
killed?
He is not dead, Ma'mselle, bat-
He Is dying then ?—-lell me where he Is-
let me go*
Stop, Ma'mselle, cried the hostess, you we
to stay here, 1 only want the hartshorn out of
that cupboard there. Adeline tried to escape •
by the .door; hut the hostess, pushing her
aside, locked it, ami went down stairs,
Adeline's distress now entirely overcame
her, and she sat motionless and scarcely con-
scious that she existed, till roused by a sound
of footsteps near the door, which was again
opened, and three men, whom she knew to
he the Marquis's servants entered. She had
sufficient recollection to repeat the questions
she had asked the landlady; but they an-
hwered only that she must come with them,
;tnd that a chaise was waiting for her ai the
door. Still she urged her questions. Tell
me if he lives, cried she.—Yes, Ma'msclle,
he is alive, hut he is terribly wounded, and
the surgeon Is just come to him. As they
spoke they hurried her along the passage:
and without noticing her entreaties and sup-
plications to know whither she was going,
they had reached the foot of the stairs, when
her cries brought several people to the door.
To these the hostess related that the lady was
the wife of a gentleman just arrived, who had
overtaken her In her flight with a gallant;
an account which the Marquis's servants cor-
roborated, 'Tis the gentleman who has just
fought the duel, added the hostess, and it
was on her account.
Adeline, partly disdaining to take any
notice of this artful story, and partly from
her desire to know the particulars of what
had happened, contented herself with repeat-
ing her inquiries; to which one of the spec-
tators at last replied, that the gentleman was
desperately wounded. The Marquis*s people
would now have hurtled her into the chaise,
hut she sunk lifeless in their arms; and her
condition so interested the'humanity of the
spectators, that, notwithstanding their belief
of what had been said, they opposed the
effort made to carry her, senseless as she was,
Into the carriage.
She was at length taken into a room, and
by proper applications restored to her sensei.
There she so earnestly besought an explana-
f ion of what had happened, that the hostess
acquainted her with some particulars of the
lite rencounter. When the gentleman' that
was 111 heard7011? screams. Madam, said she,
he' became quite oiutrageous, as they tell Trie,
and nothing could pacify him. TheMarqttli, 
for they say he it a Marquis, but. you know
best, was then in the room whit fifty, husband
and J, and when he heard the uproar, he?
went down to tee what was the matter; and
when he came into the moot wliete ihuCaptaiti

geant Then the Captain wat§ more outrage-
ous than ever; and notwithstanding' he had

to get the sergeant's cutlass out of the scab-
bard, and immediately flew at the Marquis,
and wounded him desperately; upon which
h« was secured.—It is the Marquis then who
is wounded, said Adeline; the other gentle-
man is not hurt?
No, not he, replied the hostess; but he
will smart for It by and by, for the Marquii
swears he will do 'for him. Adeline for a
moment forgot all her misfortunes and all her
danger In thankfulness for the immediate
escape of Theodore; and she was proceeding,
to make some further inquiries concerning
him, when the Marquis's servants entered
the room, and declared they could wait no
longer. Adeline, now awakencl to a sense of-
the evils with which she was threatened,
endeavoured to win the pity of the hostess,
who however was, or affected to be, convinced
of the truth of the Marquis's, story, and
therefore insensible to all she could urge*
Again she addressed his servants, but, in
vain; they would neither suffer her to remain
longer at the inn, nor inform her whither she
was going; but in the presence of several
persons, already prejudiced by the injurtouf
assertions of the hostess, Adeline was hurried
into the chaise, and her conductors mounting
their horses, the whole party was very soon
beyond the village.
Thus ended Adeline*s share of an adven-
ture, begun with a prospect not only of secu-
rity, but o( happiness—an adventure ifhlcb
had attached her more closely to Theodore,
and shown him to be more worthy or* her
love ; but which, at the same time, had d'fs-
-tresscd her 'by new disappointment, produced
the imprisonment of her generous tod how
adored lover, and delivered both himself and
her into the power: of a rival fronted ,'>t>y

THE ROMANCE OF TUB FOREST.
 
With this intention he had begun to give
orders for keeping hones In readiness, when
the surgeon persisting most seriously, and
even passionately to exclaim that his life
would be the sacrifice of his rashness, he was
carried to a bedchamber, where his valet alone
was permitted to attend him.
This man, the convenient confident of all
hia intrigues, had been the chief instrument
in assisting his designs concerning Adeline,
and wan indeed the very person who had
brought her to the Marquis's villa on the
borders of the forest. To him the Marquis
gave his further directions concerning her:
and, foreseeing the inconvenience as well m
the danger of detaining her at the inn, he had
ordered him, with several other servants, to
carry her away immediately in a hired car™
riagc. The valet having gone to execute his
orders, the Marquis was left to his own reflec-
tions, and to the violence of contending pas-
sions.
The reproaches and continued opposition
of Theodore, the favoured lover of Adeline,
exasperated his pride and roused all his ma-
lice. He could not for a moment consider
this opposition, which was in some respects
successful, without feeling an excess of indig-
nation and inveteracy, such as the prospect of
a speedy revenge could alone enable him to
support.
When he had discovered Adeline's escape
from the villa, his surprise at first equalled
his disappointment! and, after exhausting
the paroxysms of his rage upon his domestics,
he dispatched them all different ways in pur-
suit of her, going himself to the abbey, in
the faint hope that, destitute as she was of
other succour, she might have fled thither.
La Motte, however, being as much .surprised
as himself, and as ignorant of the route which
Adeline had taken, he returned to the villa
impatient of intelligence, and found some of
his servants arrived, without any newa of
Adeline, and those who came afterwards were
as successless as the first.
A few days after, a letter from the lieute-
©ant.-colonel of the regiment informed him,
that Theodore had quitted his company, and
had been for some time absent, nobody knew
where. This information, confirming a sus-
picion which had frequently occurred to him,
that Theodore had been by some means or
other instrumental in the escape of Adeline,
all his other passions became for a time sub~
servient to his revenge, and he gave orders
for the immediate pursuit and apprehension
of Theodore: but Theodore, in the mean
time, had been overtaken and secured.
It was in consequence of having formerly
observed the growing partiality between him
find Adeline, and of intelligence received from
Xa Motte, who had noticed their interview in
ihs forest, that the JJiarquis had resolved to
remove a rival so dangerous to his love, anil
so likely to be informed of his designs. ]]t.
had therefore tuld Theodore, in a manner m
plausible as 1m,* could, that it would be neces-
sary for him to join the regiment; a notice
which affected him only as it related to Ade-
line, and which seemed the less extraordinary,
as he had already been at the villa a much
longer time than was usual with the officer*
invited by the Marquis. Theodore, indeed,
very well knew the character of the Marquis,
and had accepted his invitation rather from
an unwillingness to show any disrespect to
his colonel by a refusal, than from a sanguine
expectation of pleasure.
From the men who had apprehended Theo-
dore, the Marquis received the information,
which had enabled him to pursue andreeou-r
Adeline; but though he had now efitt'tr*!
this, he was internally a prey to the corrosive
effects of disappointed*passion and exasperated
pride, The anguish of his wound was almost
forgotten in that of his mind, and every pa;^
he felt seemed to increase his thirst of revenge,
and to recoil with new torture upon his hear?.
While he was in this state, he heard the voice
of the innocent Adeline imploring protection;
but her cries excited in him neither pity nor
remorse; and when, soon after, the carriage
drove away, and he was certain both that &he
was secured and Theodore was wretched, he
seemed to feel some cessation of mental pain,
Theodore, indeed, did suffer all that a vir-
tuous mind, labouring under oppression jm
severe, could feel; but he was at least free
from those inveterate and malignant passion*
which tore the bosom of the Marquis, and
which inflict upon the professor a punishment
more severe than any they can prompt him
to imagine for another. What indignation
he might feel towards the Marquis, was at
this time secondary to his anxiety for Adeline,
His captivity was painful, as it prevented his
seeking a just and honourable revenge; but
it was dreadful, as it withheld him from at-
tempting the rescue of her whom he loved
more than life.
When he heard the wheels of the carriage
that contained her drive off, he felt an agony
of despair which almost overcame his reason.
Even the stern hearts of the soldiers who at-
tended him were not wholly insensible to his.
wretchedness, and by venturing to blame the
conduct of the Marquis they endeavoured to
console their prisoner. The physician, who
was just arrived, entered the room during this
paroxysm of his distress, and both feeling
and expressing much concern at his condition*
inquired with strong surprise why he had
been thus precipitately removed to a room so
very unfit for his reception?
Theodore explained to him the reason of
this, of the distress he suffered, and of the
chains by which he was disgraced * and per-
 
 
ibftving the ff%§Wati listened to Mm with
attention unci compassion, lie became desirons
of'acquainting him with some further par*
titular*,' for 'which purpose he desired the
'soldiers to leave the room. The men, com-
plying with his request, stationed themselves
oiv the outside' of the door.
He then related all the particulars of the
•'late transaction, and of his connection with
the 'Marquis. The physician attended to his
narrative with deep concern, and his counte-
'liaiicc frequently expressed strong agitation.
When Theodore concluded, he remained for
some time silent and lost in thought; at.
length, .awaking from his reverie, he said,
I tear your situation is desperate: the cha-
racter of the Marquis is too well known to
suffer him either tc be loved or respected;
from such a man you have nothing to hope,
for he has scarcely any thing to fear: 1 wish
it was in my power to serve you, hut I sec
no possibility of it
Alas! said Theodore, my situation is in-
deed desperate, and—for that suffering angel
—deep sobs interrupted his voice, and the
violence Of his agitation would not allow him
to proceed. The physician could only ex-
press the sympathy he felt for his distress,
and entreat him to he more calm, when a
servant entered the room from the Marquis,
who desired to see the physician immediately,
After some time, he said he would attend the
Marquis; And hating endeavoured to attain
*, degree of composure which he found it
difficult to assume, he wrung the hand of
Theodore and quitted the room, promising to
return before he left the house.
He found the1 Marquis much agitated both
in body tod mind, and rather more appre-
hensive for the consequences of the wound
than he. had expected. His anxiety for
Theodore now suggested a plan, by the cxe.
cution of which he hoped he might be able
to serve htm. Having felt his patient's pulse,
and asked some questions, he assumed a very
serious look; when the Marquis, who watched
every turn of his countenance, desired he
would, without hesitation, speak his opinion.
1 am sorry to alarm you, my Lord, but
here is some reason for apprehension: how
long is it since, you received the wound.
0ood 0od! there is clanger then ! cried the
Marquis,, adding some bitter execrations
against Theodore—There certainly it clanger, •
replied, the physician; a few hours may ena-

A few,, hours, Sir! interrupted the Marquis;
* few hours! The' physician entreated him
to , be , more ''.calm, , Confusion! cried the _
Marquis; a roan in health may, with great"
composure, entreat a dying nlan to be, calm,
Theodore will' be broke upon the wheel for
it, Jiowei?er. .
You mistake me, Sir, said the physician;
If 1 believed you a dying man, or, -iqdM1,
very near death, 1 should not havt spokea us
1 did. But it ii of consequence I should
know how long the wound lias bee© inflicted.
—The Marquis'« terror now began to subside,
anil lie gave a circumstantial account of Uie
affray with Theodore, representing thai be hud
been basely used in an affair worn bis own
conduct had been perfectly Just an4 humane
The physician heard this relation, with great
coolness, and when it concluded without
making any comment upon it, told the'Mar-
quis lie would prescribe a medicine which he
wished him to take immediately.
The Marquis again alarmed by the gravity
of his manner, entreated he would declare
most seriously, whether he thought him in
immediate danger. The physician hesitated,
and the anxiety of the Marquis increased: It
is of consequence, said he, that I should
know my exact situation. The physician
then said, that if lie had any worldly affairs
to settle, it would be as well to attend to
them, for that it was impossible to say what
might be the event.
He then turned the discourse, and said he
had just been with the young officer under
arrest, who, he hoped, would not. bo removed
at present, as such a procedure must endanger
his life* The Marquis uttered a dreadful
oath, and, cursing Theodore for having
brought him to his present condition, said he
should depart with the guard that veiy night
Against the cruelty of this sentence the phy-
sician ventured to expostulate; and endea-
vouring to awaken the Marquis to a sense of
humanity, pleaded earnestly for Theodore.
But these entreaties and arguments seemed,
by displaying to the Marquis a part of his
own character, to rouse his resentment -and
rekindle all the violence of his passions.
The physician at length withdrew in des-
pondency, after promising, at the Marquis's
request, not to leave the inn* He had hoped,
by aggravating his danger, to obtain, some
advantages both for Adeline and Theodore;
but the plan had quite a contrary effect: for
the apprehension o( death, so dreadful to the
guilty mind of the Marquis, instead of awak-
ening penitence, increased his desire of ven-
geance against the man who had brought him
to such a situation. He determined to have
'Adeline conveyed where Theodore, should lie
by any accident escape, could never obtain
her; and thus to secure to himself' at least
some means of revenge, lie knew, howef er,
that when' Theodore was once safely cotif eyed
to his regiment, his destruction wa* certain;
for should he even be acquitted-of 'thfriU'ten..
tion of deserting, he' would be condemned for

he had nothing more to hope. - For himself
he felt little,; it was for his family and Ade-

desired the physician to assist him in obtain-
ing it; but,the, landlord and his wife either
were, or affected to.be, ignorant of the matter,
and; .it .was. in fain to apply to any other
person.
The sergeant now entered with orders from
the .Marquis for the immediate departure of
Theodore, who heard the message with com-
posure, though the physician could not help
expressing his indignation at this precipitate
removal, and, his dread of the consequences
that might attend it. Theodore had scarcely
time to declare his gratitude for the kindness
of this valuable friend, before the soldiers
entered the room to conduct htm to the car-
riage in waiting. As he bade him farewell,
Theodore slipped his purse into his hand,
and turning abruptly away, told the soldiers
to lead on: but the physician stopped him,
and' refused the present with such serious
warmth that he was compelled to resume it.
He wrung the hand of his new friend, and
being unable to speak, hurried away. The
whole party immediately set off; and the
unhappy Theodore was left to the remem-
brance of his past hopes and sufferings, to
his anxiety for the fate of Adeline, the con-
templation of his present wretchedness, and
the apprehension of what might be reserved
for him in future. For himself, indeed, he
saw nothing but destruction, and was only
relieved from total despair by a feeble hope
that  she whom he loved better than himself
might one time enjoy that happiness of which
he did not venture to look for a participation.

Meaxwhile the persecuted Adeline con-
tinued to travel, with little interruption, all
night. Her mind suffered such a tumult of
grief, regret, despair, and terror, that she
could not be said to think. The Marquis's
valet, who had placed himself in the chaise
with her, at first seemed inclined to talk;
but her inattention soon silenced him, and
left her to the indulgence of her own misery.
They seemed to travel through obscure
lanes and by-ways, along which the carriage
drove as furiously as the darkness would
permit. When the dawn appeared, she per-
ceived herself on the borders of a forest, and
renewed her entreaties to know whither she
was going. The man replied he had no
orders'lo tell, but she would soon see. Ade-
line, who had hitherto supposed they were
carrying her to the villa, now began to doubt
it; and as every place appeared less terrible
to her imagination than that, her despair
began to abate, and she thought only of the
devoted Theodore, whom die knew to be the
victim of malice and revenge.
They now entered upon the forest, and it
occurred to her that she was going to the
abbey; for though she had no remembrance
of the scenery through which she passed, it
"was not the less probable that this was the
forest of Fontanville, whose boundaries were
by much too extensive to have come withm
the circle of her former walks. This conjec-
ture revived a terror little inferior to that
occasioned by the idea of going to the villa;
for at the abbey she would be equally in the
power of the Marquis, and also in that of
her cruel enemy La Motte, Her mind re-
volted at the picture her fancy drew; and as
the carriage moved under the shades, she
threw from the window a look of eager in-
quiry for some object which might confirm
or destroy her present surmise: she did not
long look, before an opening in the forest
showed her the distant towers of the abbey—
1 am, indeed, lost then, said she, bursting
into tears.
They were soon at the foot of the lawn,
and Peter was seen running to open the gate,
at which the carriage stopped. When he
saw Adeline, he looked surprised and made
an effort to speak; but the chaise now drove
up to the abbey, where, at the door of thy
hall, La Motte himself appeared. As he
advanced to take her from the carriage, an
universal trembling seized her; it was with
the utmost difficulty she supported herself,
and for some moments she neither observed
his countenance nor heard his voice. He
offered his arm to assist her into the abbey,
which she at first refused, but having tottered
a few paces was obliged to accept; they then
entered the vaulted room, where, sinking
into a chair, a flood of tears came to her
relief. La Motte did not interrupt the si-
Ill
 
knee, which continued tor some time, but
iKtced tlic room in seeming agitation. When
Adeline was sufficiently recovered to notice
external objects* she observed his countenances
and there read the tumult of' his soul, while
lie was struggling to assume a firmness which
his better feelings opposed.
La Matte now took her hand, and would
hare led her from the room ; but she stopped,
and with a kind of desperate courage made
an effort to engage hhn to pity and to save
her. He interrupted tier; It is not in my
power, said he in a voice of emotion; 1 am
not master of myself or my conduct; inquire
no further-—it is sufficient for you to know
that 1 pity you ; more 1 cannot do. He gave
her no time to reply, but taking her hand led
her to the stairs of the tower, and from thence
to the chamber ftlie had, formerly occupied.
Here you must remain for the present, said
he, in a confinement which is, perhaps, al-
most as involuntary on my part as it can be
on yours, 1 am willing to render it as easy
as possible, and have therefore ordered sonic
books to be brought you.
Adeline made an effort to speak; but he
hurried from the room, seemingly ashamed of
the part he had undertaken, and unwilling
to trust himself with her tears. She heard
the door of the chamber locked; and then
looking towards the windows, perceived they
were secured : the door that led to the other
apartments was also fastened. Such prepa-
ration for security shocked her ; and hopeless
as she had Jong believed herself, she now
perceived her mind sink deeper in despair.
When the tears she shed had somewhat re-
lieved her, and her thoughts could, turn from
the subjects of her immediate concern, she
was thankful for the total seclusion allotted
her, since it would spare her the pain she
must feel in the presence of Monsieur and
Madame La Motte, and allow the unrestrained
indulgence of her own sorrow and reflection;
reflection which, however distressing, was
preferable to the agony Inflicted on the mind
when, agitated by care and fear, it is obliged
to assume an appearance of tranquillity.
In about a quarter of an hour her chamber,
door was unlocked, and Annette appeared
with refreshments and books: she expressed
satisfaction at seeing Adeline again, but
seemed fearful of speaking, knowing, proba-
bly, that if was contrary to the orders of 1m
Motte, who, she said, was waiting at the
bottom of the stairs. When Annette was
gone, Adeline toolc some refreshment, which
was indeed necessary, for she had tasted no-
thing since she left the inn. She was pleased,
but not surprised, that Madame La Motte
did not appear, who, it was evident, shunned
her from a consciousness of her own ungene-
rous conduct,—a consciousness which offered
some presumption that she m-as' still not,
wholly unfriendly to her. She reflected 'upon'
the word* of La Motte,—I am not master of
myself or my conduct,^and though they sf-"
forded her no hope, she derived sortie comfort,1 -
poor as it was, from the belief Untitle pitied
tier. After some time spent in1 miserable'^re-
flection and various conjectures, bar feffgi
agitated spirits *eemed to demand' repose, and
she lay down to sleep. ';
Adeline slept quietly for several' hours,'
and awoke with a mind refreshed and trari-'
quiUised. To prolong thin temporary peace,
and to prevent therefore the intrusion of her'
own thoughts, she examined the books \m
Motte had sent Iter: among these she found
some that in happier times had elevated her
mind and interested her heart: their effect
was now weakened ; they were still, however,'
able to soften for a time the sense of her
misfortunes.
Bui this pjethcan medicine to a wounded
mind was but a temporary blessing; the' en-
trance of La Motte dissolved the illusions of
the page, and awakened her to a sense of her
own situation. He came with food, and having
placed it on the table left the room without
speaking, Again she endeavoured to read,
but his appearance had broken the enchant*
ment; bitter reflection returned to her mind,
and brought with it the image of Theodore*?.
of Theodore lost to her for ever!
La Motte meanwhile experienced all. the
terrors that could be inflicted by a conscience
not wholly hardened to guilt. He had been
led on by passion to dissipation, and from
dissipation to vice; but having once touched
the borders of infamy, the progressive steps
followed each other fast, and he now Raw him-
self the pander of a villain, and the betrayer
of an innocent girl whom every plea of jus**
tice and humanity called upon him to protect.
He contemplated his picture—be shrank from
it, but he could change its deformity only
by an effort too nobly daring for a mind al«
ready effeminated by vice. He viewed the
dangerous labyrinth into which he was led,
and perceived, as if for the first time, the
progression of his guilt: from this labyrinth
he weakly imagined further guilt could alone
extricate him. Instead of employing Ills
mind upon the means of saving Adeline from
destruction, and himself from being instru-
mental to it, lie endeavoured only to lull the
pangs of conscience, and to persuade himself
into a belief that he must proceed in the course
lie had begun. He knew himself'to be in the
power of the Marquis, and he dreaded that'
power more than the sure though distant
punishment that awaits upon guilt. The
honour of Adeline, and the quiet of his own
conscience, he consented to barter for a fetf
years of existence.
He was ignorant of the present Illness of
the Marquis, or he would have perceived that
<r.
THE ROMANOK Ok THK FOR
 
thtm was a chance of escaping the tlurcatened
punishment at a price less enormous than
infamy, and he would perhaps have endea-
voured to aave Adeline and himself by flight.
But the Marquis, foreseeing the possibility
of this, had ordered his servants carefully to
conceal the circumstance which detained him,
and to acquaint La Motte that he should he
at the abbey in a few days, at the same time
directing his valet to await him there, Ade-
line, as he expected, had neither inclination
nor opportunity to mention it; and thus La
Motte remained ignorant of the circumstance
which might have preserved him from further
guilt and Adeline from misery.
Most unwillingly had La Motte made his
wife acquainted with the action which had
made him absolutely dependant upon the will
of the Marquis; but the perturbation of his
mind partly betrayed him: frequently in his
sleep lie muttered incoherent sentences, and
frequently would start from his slumber, and
call in passionate exclamation upon Adeline.
These instances of a disturbed mind had
alarmed and terrified Madame La Motte, who
watched while he slept, and soon gathered
from liis words a confused idea of the Mar-
qufe'ft designs.
She hinted her suspicions to La Motte,
who reproved her for having entertained them;
but his manner, instead of repressing, in«
creased her fears for AdeMne; fears, which
the conduct of the Marquis soon confirmed*
On the night that he slept at the abbey, it
had occurred to her that whatever scheme was
in agitation it would now most probably be
discussed ; and anxiety for Adeline made her
stoop to a meanness which, in other circum-
stances, would have been despicable. She
quitted her room, and concealing herself in
an apartment adjoining that in which she had
left the Marquis and her husband, listened
to their discourse. It turned upon the sub-
ject she had expected, and disclosed to her
the full extent of their designs. Terrified
for Adeline, and shocked at the guilty weak-
ness of La Motte, the was for some time
incapable of thinking, or determining how to
proceed. She knew her husband to be under
great obligation to the Marquis, whose terri«
tory thus afforded him a shelter from the
world, and that it was in the power at' the
former to betray him into the hands of his
enemies. She believed also that the Marquis
would do this, if provoked : yet she thought,
upon such an occasion, La Motte might find
some way of appeasing the Marquis without
subjecting himself to dishonour. After some
further reflection, her mind became more
composed, and she returned to her chamber,
where La Motte soon followed. Her spirits,
however, were not now in a state to encounter
either his displeasure or his opposition, which
she had too much reason to expect whenever
she should mention the subject of her e<v.
cern, and she therefore resolved not fo notice
it till the morrow.
On the morrow she told La Motte all he
had uttered in his dreams; and mention*:*!
other circumstances, which convinced him it
was in vain any longer to deny the truth of
her apprehensions. His wife then represented
to him how possible it was to avoid the
infamy into which he was about to plunge,
by quitting the territories of the Marquis;
and pleaded so warmly for Adeline-, that La
Motte in sullen silence appeared to meditate
upon the plan. His thoughts were however
very differently engaged- He was conscious
of having deserved from the Marquis a dread-
ful punishment, and knew that if he exasper-
ated him by refusing to acquiesce with his
wishes, he had little to expect from flight,
for the eye of justice and revenge would pursue
him with indefatigable research.
La Motte meditated how to break tin's to
his wife, for he perceived that there was no
other method of counteracting her virtuosi*
compassion for Adeline, and the dangerous
consequences to he expected from it, than by
opposing it with terror for his safety; and
this could be done only by showing her the
full extent, of the evils that must attend the
resentment of the Marquis. Vice had not
yet so entirely darkened his conscience, but
that the blush of shame stained his cheek,
and his tongue faltered when he would have
told his guilt. At length, finding it impossi-
ble to mention particular*, he told her that
on account of an affair which no entreaties
should ever induce him to explain, his life
was in the power of the Marquis, Yon sec
the alternative, said he, take your choice of
evils; and, if you can, tell Adeline of her
danger, and sacrifice my life to save her from
a situation which many would be ambitious
to obtain.—.Madame La Motte, condemned
to the horrible alternative of permitting the
seduction of innocence, or of dooming her
husband to destruction, suffered a distraction
of thought which defied all controul, Perce i v -
ing, however, that an opposition to the design?.
of the Marquis would ruin La Motte and
avail Adeline little, she determined to yield
and endure in silence.
At the time when Adeline was planning
her escape from the abbey, the significant
looks of Peter had led La Motte to suspect the
truth and to observe them more closely. He
had seen them separate in the hall with
apparent confusion, and had afterwards ob-
served them conversing together in the clois-
ters. Circumstances so unusual l^ft him no*
a doubt that Adeline had discovered her
danger, and was concerting with Peter some
means of escape. Affecting, therefore, to be
informed of the whole affair, he- charged
Peter with treachery towards' himself, and
«§
 
threatened him with the vengeance ©C the
Marquis H, he did not disclose all lie knew.
The menace intimidated Peter, and supposing
that all chance of assisting Adeline was gone,
lie, made a circumstantial confession, and
promised to forbear acquainting Adeline with
the discovery of the scheme. In this pre-
mine he was seconded by inclination, for he
feared to meet the displeasure which Adeline,
believing he had betrayed her, might express.
On the evening of the day on which Ade«
line's intended escape was discovered, the
Marquis designed to come to the abbey, and
it had been agreed that he should then take
Adeline to his villa. La Motte had inmnedi.
ately perceived the advantage of permitting
Adeline to repair, in the belief of being un-
discovered, to the tomb. It would prevent
much disturbance and opposition, and spare
himself the pain he must feel in her presence,
when she should know that he had betrayed
her, A servant of the Marquis might go at
the appointed hour to the tomb, and wrapt
In the disguise of night might take her
quietly thence in the character of Peter,
Thus, without resistance she would he car-
ried to the villa, nor discover her mistake till
it was too late to prevent its consequence.
When the Marquis did arrive, La Motte,
who was not so much intoxicated by the
wine he had drunk as to forget his prudence,
informed him of what hail happened and
what he had planned; and the Marquis
approving it, his servant was made acquainted
with the signal, which afterwards betrayed
Adeline to his power.
A deep consciousness of the unworthy
neutrality she had observed in Adeline's con-
cerns, made Madame La Motte anxiously
avoid seeing her now that she was again in
the abbey, Adeline understood this conduct!
and she rejoiced that she was spared the
anguish of meeting her as an enemy, whom
she had once considered as a friend. Several
days now passed in solitude, in miserable
retrospection, aad dreadful expectation. The
perilous situation of Theodore was almost the
constant subject of her thoughts. Often did
she breathe an agonizing wish for his safety,
and often look round the sphere of possibility
in search of hope; but hope had almost left
the horizon of her prospect, and when it did
appear, it sprung only from the death of the
Marquis, whose vengeance threatened most
certain destruction.
The Marquis, meanwhile, lay at the inn at
Caux, in a state of very doubtful recovery.
The physician and surgeon, neither of whom
he would dismiss nor suffer to leave the vil-
lage, proceeded upon contrary principles; and
the good effect of what the one prescribed,
was frequently counteracted by the injudici-
ous treatment of the other. Humanity alone
prevailed on the physician to continue Ms
attendance. The malady of the Marquis was
also heightened by the' Imjuitletite of his
temper, the terrors of ideath,"and .the^tritslSoii
of his passions. One looineht he hellevttl
himself dying, another  he could scarcely he
prevented from attempting to MldV Aclelpk

ations' of hit mind, atid * so rmpfi' the* sehc*Ms
that succeeded each other, tbat: hit" pasiidfis

physician attempted to; permfale Wm'" that
his recovery greatly depended upon tranqui-
lity, and to prevail upon him to attempt at
least some command -of his feelings; hut' he
was soon silenced in hopeless disgust by the
impatient answers of the Mafiguis.
At length the servant who had carried off
Adeline returned; and the Marquis having
ordered him into his chamber, asked,so' many
questions in a breath, that the matt knew not
which to answer. At length he pulled a
folded paper from his pocket, which he :s«id
had been dropped in the chaise by Mademoi-
selle Adeline, and as he thought his Lord-
ship would like to see it, he had taken care
of it. The Marquis stretched forth his hand
with eagerness, and received a note addressed
to Theodore. On perceiving the superscrip-
tion, the agitation of jealous rage for a mo-
ment overcame him, and he held it in his
hand unable to open it.
He, however, broke the seal, and found it
to be a note of inquiry, written by Adeline to
Theodore during his illness, and which • from
some accident she had been prevented 'from
sending him. "The tender solicitude it ex.
pressed for his recovery stung the soul of the
Marquis, and drew from him a comparison
of her feelings on the illness of his rival'and
that of himself. She could be solicitous for
his recovery, said he, but for mine sbe'ohly
dreads it , As if willing to prolong, thV'giain
this little billet had excited, he then,read it
again. Again he cursed his fate and .execrated
his rival. Giving - himself uj>, m usual, to

.seal, and he looked earnestly at it,: hiff'a^ger

the note carefully in his pocket-boot,' and
was for some time lost in thought.' '" ,"
After many days of hopes .'and fears,' the
strength of his constitution overcame his ill-
ness, and he was well enough to write several
letters, one of which he immediately sent off
to prepare La Motte for his reception* The
same policy which had prompted him to con-
ceal his illness from La, Motte,,now, w%ed
him to say what he knew would not .happen,
that he should reach the abbey on the 'day
after his servant, He repeated, this fnjttac*
tion, that Adeline should be strictly gaaftfcd,
and renewed his .promises of <£*$& 'Ibf'' the

La yMbttc', to whom each" succeeding day

condoning ' the absence' of the Marquis, re-
ceived this notfoe with uneasiness; for he
had begun to hope'that the Marquis Bad

being eitbtr engaged'"In some new adventure,
or obliged 'to visit his estates in sonic distant
province: he would have been willing thus 
to have 'got rid of an affair, which' was to
reflect so much dishonour on himself.
This hope Was now vanished, and he
directed Madame to prepare for the'reception
of the Marquis. Ackline passed these clays
in a state of suspense which was now cheered
by hope and now darkened by despair. The 
delay, so much exceeding her expectation,
seemed to prove that the illness of the Blar-
quis was dangerous; and when she looked
forward to the consequences of his' recovery,
she could not he sorry that it was so. So
odious was the idea of him to her mind, that
she would not suffer her lips to pronounce
his name, nor make the inquiry of Annette,
which was of such consequence to her peace*
It was about a week after the receipt of
the Marquis's letter that Adeline one day saw
from her window a party of horsemen enter
the avenue, and knew them to he the Mar-
quis and his attendants. She retired from
the window, in a state of mind not to he de-
scribed, and sinking into a chair, was for
some time scarcely conscious of the objects
around her. When she had recovered from
the first terror which his appearance excited,
she again tottered to the window; the party
was not in sight, hut she heard the trampling
of horses, and knew that the Marquis had
wound round to the great gate of the abbey.
She addressed herself to< Heaven for support
and protection; and her mind being now some-
what composed, sat down to wait the event.
La Motte received  the Marquis with ex-
pressions of surprise at his long absence; and
the latter, merely saying he had been detained
by illness, proceeded to inquire for Adeline.
lie was told she was in her chamber, from
whence she might be summoned if he wished
to see her* The Marquis hesitated, and at
length excused himself, but desired she might
be strictly watched, Perhaps, my Lord, said
La Motte- smiling, Adeline's obstinacy has
been to© powerful for your passion? you
seem less interested 'concerning her than
'formerly.
O! by no means* replied the Marquis;
 she interests me if possible, more than ever;
so much, indeed, that 1 cannot have her too
closely guarded; and 1 therefore beg, La
Motte, that you will suffer nobody to attend
 her but when mm can observe them yourself.
Is the room where she is confined sufficiently
 secure,? La Motte assured him it was-; but
at the same time, expressed his wlA ***»*, *»*«»
was removed to the villa." If by any means,
said he, she should contrive to escape, 1 know
what I must expect from your dispkaMire;
and this reflection keeps my mind in conti-
nual anxiety.
This removal cannot be at present, said
the Marquis; she is safer here, and you do
wrong to disturb yourself with any apprehen-
sion of'her escape, if her chamber is so secure
'as you represent it.
'I can have no motive for deceiving you, my
Lord, in this point.
I do not suspect you of any, said the
Marquis; guard her carefully, and trust tin*
she will not escape. 1 can rely upon my
valet, and if you wish it he shall remain hero.
La Motte thought there could be no occasion
for him, and it was agreed that the man
should go home.
The Marquis, after remaining about half
an hour in conversation with La Motte, lel't
the abbey; and Adeline saw him depart with
a mixture of surprise and thankfulness that
almost overcame her. She had waited in
momentary expectation of being summoned
to appear, and had been endeavouring to arm
herself with resolution to support his presence,
She had listened to every voice that sounded
from below; and at every step that crossed
the passage her heart had' palpitated with
dread, lest it should be La Blotte coming to
lead her to the Marquis. This state of suf-
fering had been prolonged almost beyond her
power of enduring it, when she heard voices
under her window, and rising, saw the Mar-
quis ride away. After giving way to the joy
and thankfulness that swelled her heart, she
endeavoured to account for this circumstance,
which, considering what had passed, was cer-
tainly very strange. It appeared, indeed,
wholly inexplicable; and after much fruitless
inquiry, she quitted the subject, endeavouring
to persuade herself that it could only portend
good.
The time of La Motte's usual visitation How
drew near, and Adeline expected it in the trem-
bling hope of hearing that the'Marquis had
ceased his persecution; but he was, as usual,
sullen and silent, and it was not till he was
about to quit the room that Adeline had the
courage to inquire when the Marquis was
-"expected again. La Blotte, opening the door
to depart, replied, on the following day; and
Adeline, whom fear and delicacy embarrassed,
saw she could obtain no intelligence of Theo-
dore but by a direct question; she looked
earnestly, as if she would have spoke, and he
stopped;  but she blushed and was still silent,
till upon his again attempting_ to leave the
room she faintly called him back.
 I wctald ask, said she, after that unfortunate
-chevalier who has incurred the resentment of

He ha&9 replied La Motte; am! yonF indif-
ference tow aids the Mar quia m now * fully ,
explained.
Since I must feci resentment towards those
who injure me, said Adeline, I may surely be
allowed to be grateful towards those who .serve
me. Ha4 the Marquis deserved my esteem,
he would probably nave possessed it,
Well, well, said La Motte, this young
hero, who it seems has been brave enough to
lift his arm against his Colonel, k taken care
of, and I doubt not will soon be sensible of
the value of his quixotism.-—Indignation,
grief, and fear, struggled in the bosom of
Adeline; she disdained to gi?c La Motte an
opportunity of again pronouncing the name
of Theodore; yet the uncertainty under which
she laboured, urged her to inquire whether
the Marcrais had heard of him since lie Lft
Caux. Yes, said La Motte, he lias been
safely carried to his regiment, where he is
confined till the Marquis can attend to appear
against him.
Adeline had neither power nor inclination
to inquire further; and La Motte quitting
the chamber, she was left to the misery he
had renewed. Though this information con-
tained no new circumstance of misfortune,
(for she now heard continued what she had
always expected,) a weight of new sorrow
seemed to fall upon her heart, and slie per-
ceived that she had unconsciously cherished
a latent hope of Theodore's escape before he
reached the place of his destination. All
hope was now, however, gone; he was suffer-
ing the miseries of a prison, and the tortures
of apprehension both for his own life and her
safety. She pictured to herself the dark damp
dungeon where he lay, loaded with chains and
pale with,sickness and grief; she heard him,
in a voice that thrilled her heart, call upon
her name, and raise his eyes to heaven in
silent supplication: she saw the anguish of
his countenance, the tears that fell slowly on
his ,.cheek.; and remembering at the same
time, the generous conduct that had brought
him to this abyss of misery, and that it was
for her sake he suffered, grief resolved itself
into despair, her tears ceased to flow, and she
sunk silently into a state of dreadful torpor.
On the morrow the Marquis arrived, and
departed m before.. Several days then elapsed,
and he did not appear; till one evening, as
La Motte and. hit wife were in their usual
sitting-room, he entered, and conversed for
some time upon general subjects, from which,
Jio\¥CL?ex, he by degrees fell into a reverie,
and after a pause of silence he rose and drew
La Motte to the window, I would speak to
yon alone, said he, if you are at leisure;., if
not, another time will do* La Motte assuring
him he was perfectly-, .so, would have mm*
ducted hiin to another room, bat the Marquis
proposed a walk in the forest. They went
out together,} and when they had reached ,<a
solitary glade, where the spreading ibranofae*
of the beech and oak deepe»ed the shades of
twilight and threw a solemn obscurity around*
the Marquis turned to La Motte and'addressed*
him:. - > - -  > - -
Your condition. La MoUe> u unhappy;
this abbey ii a melancholy residence for' *
man like you fond of society, md like -yon
also qualified to adorn it. La Motte bowed*
I wish it was in my power to restore you to'
the world, continued the Marquis; pet hap*,.
if I knew the particulars of .the aftair which
has driven you from it, 1 might perceive'that
my interest could effectually -serve you:—.!
think 1 have heard yon bint it was "an aftair
of honour? La Motte was silent. I menu
not to distress you, however; nor is it common
curiosity that, prompts this inquiry, but a
•sincere desire to befriend you* You have
already informed me of sonic particulars of
your misfortunes; 1 think the liberality of
your temper led yon into expenses' which
you afterwards endeavoured to retrieve by
gaming?
Yes, my Lord, said Ija Motte, 'tis trite
that I dissipated the greater part of an affluent
fortune in luxurious indulgences, and that I
afterwards took unworthy means to recover
its but I wish to be spared upon this subject,
1 would, if possible, lose the remembrance of
a transaction which must for ever stain my
character, anil the rigorous effect of wtiieh,'
1 fear, it is not in your power, my Lord, to
soften.
You may be mistaken on this point, re-
plied the Marquis; my interest at court'is by
no means inconsiderable. Fear not from me
any severity of censure; 1 am not at- all in-
clined to judge harshly of the faults of others:
I well know how to allow for the eiYte?ge»t$y
ofcircumstane.es; and I think La Motte, you
have hitherto found me your friend,
1 have, my Lord* - • •
^ And when you recollect, that I have for-
gives a certain tiansaction of late date—-*"'"'
It is true, my Lord; and allow me to- say,
I have a just sense of your generosity. The
transaction you-allude to is by'far the worst
of my life; and what ,1 have to relate 'carmot
therefore lower me in your opinion. When
I had dissipated the greatest part of my pro.
perty in habits of voluptuous pleasure, I'
had tecourse m gaming to supply the means'
of continuing them. A run of good luck for
some time enabled me to do this; and encott-"
raging mj most sanguine1 expectations,' I
continued in the same career of success.
Soon after this, a' sudden turn of fortune
destroyed my hopes, and reduced' me- to the
most desperate extremity* In one night"my
money was lowered to the sum of two hundred
louise These 1 resolved to stake- alto, aid
with them,my life;- for it was- my yeaeluifoft
THE ROMANCE OF THE FOHEST,
not to survive their loss. Never shall I forget
the horrors of that moment on which hung
my fete, nor the deadly anguish that seized
my heart when my last stake was gone. I
stood for some time in a state of stupefaction,
till, roused to a sense of my misfortune, my
passion made me pour forth execrations on
my more fortunate rivals, and act all the
phren&y of despair. During this paroxysm
of madness, a gentleman, who had been a
silent observer of all that passed, approached
me,—You are unfortunate. Sir, said he I
need not he informed of that. Sir, I replied.
You have perhaps been ill used? resinned
he.—Yes, Sir, I am ruined, and therefore it
may he said I am ill used.
Do you know the people you have plaved
with?
No | hut I have met them in the first
circles.
Then I am probably mistaken, said he,
and walked away. His last words roused
me, and raised a hope that my money had not
been fairly lost. Wishing for further in-
formation, I went in search of the gentleman,
but he had left the rooms, I however stifled
my transports, returned to the table where I
had lost my money, placed myself behind
the chair of one of the persons who had won
it, and closely watched the game. For some
time I saw nothing that could confirm my
suspicions, hut was at length convinced they
were just*
When the game was ended I called one of
my adversaries out of the room, and telling
him what I had observed, threatened in»
stantly to expose him if he did not restore
my property* The man was for some time
as positive as myself; and assuming the
bully, threatened me with chastisement for
my scandalous assertions. I was not, how-
ever, in a state of mind to be frightened;
and his manner served only to exasperate my
temper, already sufficiently inflamed by mis-
fortune. After retorting hits threats, I was
about to return to the apartment we had left,
and expose what had passed, when, with an
insidious smile and a softened voice, he
* begged I would favour him with a few mo*
xuents* attention, and allow him to speak with
the gentleman his partner, To the latter part
of his request I hesitated, but in the mean
time the gentleman himself entered the room.
His partner related-to him, in few words,
what had passed between us, and the terror
that appeared in his countenance sufficiently
declared his consciousness of guilt.
They then drew aside, and remained a few
minutes in conversation together, after which
they approached me with an offer, as they
phrased it, of a compromise. I declared,
however, against any thing of this kind, and
swore nothing less than the whole sum 1 had
lost .should content sue—*-Ia it not possible,
Monsieur, that you may be offered somctlmig
as advantageous as the whole?—J did not
understand their mmnmg; but after th«-v
had continued for some time to give distant
hints of the same sort, they proceeded to
explain.
 Perceiving their characters wholly in my
power, they wished to secure my interest ti>
their party, and therefore informing m*» that
they belonged to an association of person
who lived upon the folly and inexperience of
others, they offered me a share in their con-
cern. My fortunes were desperate; and the
proposal now made me would not oniv pro.
duce an immediate supply, but enable me to
return to those scenes of dissipated pleasure
to which passion had at first, and long habit
afterwards, attached me. I closed with the
offer, and thus sunk from dissipation into
infamy.
La Motte paused, as if the recollection of
these times filled him with remorse. The
Marquis understood his feelings. You jmlg*.-
too rigorously of yourself, said he5 there are
few persons, let their appearance of honesty
be what it may, who in such circumstances
would have acted better than you have done.
Had I been in your situation, I know not
how I might have acted. That rigid virtue
which shall condemn you, may dignify itself
with the appellation of wisdom, but I wish
not to possess it; let it still reside where it
generally is to be found, in the cold bosoms
of those who, wanting feeling to be men, dig-
nify themselves with the title of philosophers.
But pray proceed.
Our success was for some time unlimited,
for we held the wheel of fortune, and trusted
not to her caprice. Thoughtless and volup-
tuous by nature, my expenses fully kept pace
with my income. An unlucky discovery of
the practices of our party was at length made
by a young nobleman, which obliged us to
act for some time with the utmost circum-
spection. It would be tedious to relate the
particulars, which made us at length so sus-
pected, that the distant civility and cold re-
serve of our acquaintance rendered the fre-
quenting public assemblies both painful mv.i
unprofitable. \Ye turned our thoughts to
other modes of obtaining money; and a
swindling transaction, in which 1 engaged to
a very large amount, soon compelled me to
leave Paris. You know the rest my Lord.
La Motte was now silent, and the Marquis
continued for some time musing. You per-
ceive, my Lord, at length resumed La Motte,
you perceive that my case is hopeless.
It is bad indeed, but not entirely hopeless.
From my soul I pity you j yet, if yon should
return to the world, and incur the danger of
prosecution, I think my interest with the
minister might save you from any severe
punishment. You seem, however, to hav?

and twist me'those who do we lest* It is in

loaded with obligation? who lives by your
mercyf and-almost by your means! The
Marquis looked'earnestly, at him, but did not
speak. 1 have not deserved this of you, my
Lord} speak, I entreat you.' .
There ate certain prejudices attached to the
human mind, said the Marquis in a slow and
aolamn voice, which it teqwlret all our wisdom

cherished involuntarily by. age, which grow

THE ROMANCE OF TIIE FOREST*
 
On whom that rav'oJnp br^od of fate
Who lap the blood of Sorrow wait;
Wlto, Ft at! Ittli #ha*tlv tirain can see,
And look not madly will like the© I CobMHst.
The Marquis, was punctual to the .hour.
La Motte received him at the gate; but he
leclined entering, and said he preferred, a
ralk in the forest. Thither, therefore, La
Motte attended hhm After some general
eotiYereation, Well, said the Marquis, have
you considered what I said, and are you, pre-
pared to decide?
I''have, my, Lord, and will quickly decide,
'ffoen you shall further explain yourself;
till then I can form no resolution. The
jM«€piis appeared dissatisfied, and was a
moment silent. Is it then possible, he at
length resumed, that jou do not understand?
This ignorance is surely affected. La Motte,
I expect sincerity. Tell me, therefore, is it
necessary 1 should say more?
It Is, my Lord, said La Motte immediately!
If you fear to confide in me freely, how can
1 fully accomplish your purpose?
Before 1 proceed further, said the Marquis,
let me administer some oath which shall bind
you to secrecy. But this is scarcely neces-
sary; for, could 1 even doubt your word of
honour, the remembrance of a certain trans-
action would point out to you the, necessity
of being as silent yourself as you, must wish
me to be. There was now a pause of silence,
during which both the Marquis and La
Motte betrayed some confusion. I think,
La Motte, said he, 1 have given you sufficient
proof that 1 can be grateful: the services
you have already rendered me with respect to
.Adeline have not been unrewarded.
True, my Lord;1 I am" ever willing to
acknowledge this; arid am sorry it lias not
been  in my power to serve you more effectu-
ally. Your further'views respecting her 1
am .ready to assist.
, 1" thank you.—Adeline—the Marquis
.hesitated—*Adeline, rejoined La Motte, cage*
to anticipate his wishes, has beauty worthy
.of your pursuit; she has inspired a passion
of which she ought to be proud, and at any
.rate she shall soon be yours. Her charms
.axe worthy of——
Yes, yes, interrupted the Marquis; hut-
he pauied. But they have given you too
'.much trouble in the pursuit, said La Motte;
,and to he sure, my Lord, it must be confessed
they have; but*this trouble is,all over-—yon
may now consider her as your own*
1 would do so,--said the -Marquis, fixing an
eye of earnest regard upon La Motte—I
would do go. • *'"
Bam© your hour, my Lord; you, shall not
he inteirapted. Beauty such .as 'Adeline's-**
Watch her closely, interrupted the Mar-
-!»«, and' on no' account suffer her to leave
.& apartment. Where is she now?
. Confined in her chamber.
Very well. But I am impatient.
Name your time, my Lord—-to-morrow
night.
• To*morrow night, said .the Marquis, to-
morrow night. Do you understand me now?
• Yes, my -Lord, this night if you wish it
so. But, had you not better dismiss your
servants, and remain yourself in the forest?
You know the door that opens upon the
woods from the west tower. Come thither
about twelve—I will be there to conduct you
to her chamber. Remember then, my Lord,
that to night——
Adeline dies! interrupted the Marquis In
a low voice scarcely human. Do you under-
stand me now?
— La Motte shrunk aghast—My Lord!
, La Motte! said the Marquis..—There was
a silence of several minutes, in which La
Motte endeavoured, to recover himself. Let
me ask, my Lord, the meaning of this "f sml
he, when he had breath to speak* Why
should you wish the death of Adeline—of
Adeline, whom so lately you loved?
"Make lio inquiries for my motive, said the
Marquis; but it is as certain as that 1 live
that she you name must die* . This is suffi-
cient* The surprise of La Motte equal led
his horror.  The means are various, resumed
the Marquis. I could have wished that, no
hlood • might be spilt; and there are drugs
sure and speedy in their effect, but they can-
not be soon or safely procured. I also wish
it of er—it must be done quickly—this night
This night, my Lord I
Aye, ibis night, La Motte; if it is to be,
why not soon? Have you no convenient drug
at hand? , '
None, my Lord.
I feared to trust a third person, or 1 should
thave been provided, said the Marquis, As
it is, take this poniard! use it as occasion
..offers, hut be resolute. La Motte received
the poniard with a trembling hand, and con-
tinued to gaze upon it for some time, scarcely
.knowing what he did. Put it up, said, the
Marquis, and endeavour to recollect yourself.
La Motte'Obeyed, but continued to muse in
silence.
.He saw himself entangled in the web
which his own crimes had woven. Being in
the power of the Marquis, he knew he must
either consent to the commission of a deed,
from, the enormity,of which,.depraved as he
was, he shrank in horror, or sacrifice fortune,
freedom, probably life itself, to' the refusal.
He bad been i^d on by slow gradations^ from
folly to vice, til he now saw before him an
.abyss, of guilt'which, startled even the con-
science that so long had slumbered. The
means  of retreating were desperate—to pro-
ceed was ..equally so .' . - .
When he considered the innocence and the
 
 
 
 
helplessness of Adeline, her orphan state, her
former affectionate conduct, and tier confi-
dence in his protection, -his heart melted 'with
compassion for the distress lie hud already
occasioned her, and shrunk in terror from the
deed lie wan urged to commit. But when, on
the other hand, he contemplated the destruc-
tion that threatened him from the vengeance
of the Marquis, and then considered the advan-
tages that were offered him of favour, freedom,
and probably fortune,—terror and temptation
contributed to overcome the pleadings of
humanity, and silence the voice of conscience.
In this state of tumultuous uncertainty he
continued for some time silent, until the voice
of the Martiuis roused him to a conviction of
the necessity of at least appearing to acquiesce
in his designs.
Do you hesitate? said the Marquis.—--No,
my Lord, my resolution is fixed—I will obey
yoiu But mcthinks it would be better to
avoid bloodshed. Strange secrets have been
revealed by——
Aye, but how avoid it? interrupted•<the
Marquis.—Poison 1 will not venture to pro-
cure. 1 have given you one sure instrument
cf death. You also may find it dangerous to
inquire for a drug. La Motte perceived that
he cottld not purchase poison without incur-
ring a discovery much greater than that he
wished to avoid* You are right, my Ix>rd,
and 1 will follow your orders implicitly. The
Marquis now proceeded, in broken sentences,
to give further directions concerning this
dreadful scheme.
In her sleep, said he, at midnight; the
family will then be at rest. Afterwards they
planned a story which was to account for her
disappearance, and by which it was to seem
that she had sought an escape in consequence
of her aversion to the addresses of the Mar-
quis. The doors of her chamber and of the
West tower were to be left open to corroborate
this account, and many other circumstances
were to he contrived to confirm the suspicion.
They further consulted how the Marquis was
to be informed of the event; and it was agreed
that he should come as usual to the abbey on
the following day—IVwir/Al then, said the
.Marquis, I may rely upon your resolution?
You may, my Lord.
Farewell, then. When we meet again——.
When we meet again said La Motte, ft
will be done. He followed the Marquis to
theahbeyi and having seen him mount his
horse and wished him a good night, he re-
tired to his chamber, where heshut himself up.
Adeline, meanwhile, in the solitude of her
prison gave way to the despair which her
condition inspired. She tried to arrange her
thoughts, and to argue herself into some
degree of resignation; hut reflection, by re-
presenting the past, and reason, by anticipat-
ing the future, brought before her mind the
full picture of her misfortunes, and slit sunk
in despondency. Of Theodore, who, by a con-
duct so noble, had testified his attachment
and involved himself in ruin, she thought
with a degree of anguish infinitely superior
to any she had felt upon any other occasion.
That the very exertions which had defer?ed
all her gratitude, and awakened all. her
tenderness, should he the cause of his destruc-
tion, was a circumstance so much beyond the
ordinary hounds of misery, that her fortitude
sunk at once before it. 1 he idea of Theodore
suftcring—.Theodore dying—was for eve? pre-
sent to her imagination; and frequently ex-
cluding the sense of her own danger, made
her conscious only of his. Sometimes Ac
hope he had given her of being able to vindi-
cate his conduct, or at least to obtain a
pardon, would return; but it was like the
faint beam of an April morn, transient and
cheerless. She knew that the Marquis, stung
with jealousy and exasperated to revenge,
would pursue him with unrelenting malice.
Against such an enemy what could Theo-
dore oppose? Conscious rectitude would not
avail him to ward off the blow which disap-
pointed passion and powerful pride directed.
Her distress was considerably heightened by
reflecting that no intelligence of him could
reach her at the abbey, and that she must
remain she knew not how long in the most
dreadful suspense concerning his fate* From
the abbey she saw no possibility of escaping.
She was a prisoner in a chamber inclosed at
every avenue; she had no opportunity of
conversing with any person who could afford
her even a chance of relief; and she saw her-
self condemned to await in passive silence the
impending 'destiny, infinitely more dreadful
to her imagination than death itself.
Thus circumstanced, she yielded to the
pressure of her misfortunes, and would sit
for hours motionless and given up to thought.
Theodore! she would frequently exclaim,
you cannot hear my voice, you cannot Ay io
help me; yourself a prisoner and In chains.
The picture was too horrid: the swelling
anguish of her heart would subdue her urttt.
ance—.tears bathed her cheeks—and she
became insensible to eveiy thing but the
misery of Theodore. ''
On this evening her mind had been re-
markably tranquil; and as she watched ftom
her window, with a still and melancholy
pleasure, the setting sun, the fading splen.
dour of the western horizon, and the gradual
approach of twilight, her thoughts bore her
back to the time when in happier circum-
stances she had watched the same appearances.
She recollected also the evening of her tem-
porary escape from the abbey, when from
this fame window she had viewed-the declin-
ing sun—how anxiously she had' awaited t&
fall of twilight—how much she had ettdea-

his art, and he. quickly relapsed into silence;

Strove to conceal the absence of his thoughts.,
he answered so entirely from the purpose
that his abstraetion became snll more appa-
rent. Observing this, Madame. La Moiw*.
appeared to take no notice oi his present t* m-
per; and they continued to sit in uninter-
rupted si 1 erne till the hour of rest, when they
retired to their chamber.
La Motto lay in a slate oi disturbed watch-
fulness for some time, and his frequent
Starts awoke Madame., who however, being
pacified by some trifling excuse, soon went,
to sleep again. This agitation continued till
near midnight, when recollecting that the
time was now passing in idle reflection which
ought to be devoted to action. In* stole silently
from his bed, wrapped himself in his night-
gown, and taking the lamp which burned
nightly in his chamber, passed up the spiral
staircase. As he went he frequently looked
back, and often started and listened to tiie
hollow sighing** of the blast.
His hand shook so violently when lie
attempted to unlock the door of Adeline's
cha-niber, that he was obliged to set, the lamp
on the ground, and apply both has hands.. The
noise he made with the key induced him
to suppose he must have awakened her; but.
when he opened the door, and perceived the
stillness that reigned within, he was con-
vinced she was asleep. When he approached
the bed he heard her gently breathe, and soon
after sigh- -and he stopped: but silence return-
ing he again advanced, and then heard her sing

passage that conimunirated with the spir-.'
ytaircaset hut all was now still. In n iV*
moments, however, a light fiasrhed across tlvc

hall, and'La Motte appeared at the door of
the vaulted room. He looked up, and see-
ing Adeline in the gallery, beckoned her to
descend.
She hesiWed, and looked towards be? cham-
ber; hut'La'Motte now approached the stairs,
and with faltering steps she went to meet him.
1 fear the Marquis may see me, said- she,
whispering; where is he? La Motte took
her hand and led her on, assuring her she had
nothing to fear from the Marquis. The
wildness'of his looks, however, and the trem-
bling of' his hand, seemed to contradict this
assurance, and she inquired whether he was
leading her. To the forest, said I* Motte,
that you may escape from the abbey—a horse
waits for you without: I can save you by no
other means* New terror seised her. She
could scarcely believe that La Motte, who had
hitherto conspired with the Marquis, and had
so closely confined her, should now himself
undertake her escape; and she at this moment
felt a dreadful presentiment which It was im-
possible to account for, that he wa§ leading
her out to murder her in the forest. Again
shrinking back, she supplicated his mercy.
He assured her he meant only to protect her,
and desired sjie would not waste time*
There was something in his manner that
raeke sincerity, and she suffered him to con-
duct her to a side door that opened into the
forest, where she could just distinguish
throuA the gloom a man on horseback.
Tills brought to her remembrance the night
in which she had quitted the ton*, when,
trusting to the person who appeared, she had
been carried to the Marquis's villa. Lt
Motte called, ami was answered by Peter,
whose voice somewhat reassured Adeline.
He then told her that the Marquis would
return to the abbey on the following morning
and that this could be her only opportunity
#£ escaping Ms designs; that she might rely
upon his (La Motte's) word, that Peter had
orders to carry her wherever ihe choose; but
as he knew the Marquis would be indefatiga-
ble in search of her, he advised her by all
means to leave the kingdom, which she might
do with Peter, who was a native of Savoy,
and would convey her to the, house of his
sister. There 'she might remain till La Motte
himself, who did not now think it would
-be safe to continue much longer in France,
should join her. He entreated her, whatever
might happen, Refer to mention the e¥ents
which had passed at the abbey. To sa?e you,
Adeline, 1 have riiked my life ; do not in-
crease my danger «nd your own by any unne-
cessary discoveries. We may never -meet
ftgalrtt but 1 hope you will be happy; and re-
-member, when you .think of me, that 1 am not
: quite so bad as I have, been tempted'to be.
Having said this, he gave her some money,
which he told her would be necessary to
H
defray the expenses of hex joutnejr. Adeline
could no -longer doubt his sincerity,' and her
transports-of joy and gratitude would scarcely
permit her to thank him. She *wfehed M
have bid Madame 'La Mottc farewell, and In-
deed earnestly.requested it; but he again, told
her she ,had no time to, lose; ami having
wrapped her in a large cloak, he lifted her
upon the horse* She bade • him  adieu with
tears of gratitude, and Peter set oft* as  fast a*
the darkneis would permit.
When they were got some way,—I am
glad with all my heart, Mam'selle, said he,
to see you again. Who would have thought,
after ail, that my master himself would have
bid me take you away! Well, to be sure,
strange things come to pass; but I hope
we shall have better luck this time Adeline,
not choosing to reproach him with the trea-
chery of which she feared' he had been for-
merly guilty, thanked him for his good
wishes, and said she hoped they 'should
be more fortunate: but Peter, in his usual
strain of eloquence, -proceeded to undeceive
her in this point, and to acquaint her with
every circumstance which his memory, and it
was naturally a strong one could furnish.
Peter expressed such an artless interest
in her welfare, and such a concern for her dis-
appointment, that she -could no longer doubt
bin faithfulness; and this conviction not only
strengthened- her confidence in the present un-
dertaking, but made her listen to his conver-
sation with kindness and pleasure. I should
never have staid at the abbey till this-time,
said lie, if 1 could have got away; but my
-master frighted me so mud} about the Mar-
quis, and I Imd not mortey' enough -to carry
"me into my mm country, so that 1 was'forced
to stay. It's well we have got some solid
louis d'ors now; for I question, Ma%tsclfc,
whether the people on the road would-have
taken those trinkets you formerly talked of for
money,
Possibly not, said Adeline; I am thankful
to Monsieur La'Motte that we have mme
certain means of procuring conveniences.
What route shall you take when we leave the
forest, Peter?—Pete? .mentioned Very 'cor-
rectly a great part of the road to Lyons;
And then, said he, we can easily get to Sa-
. voy, and that will be nothing. My sifter,
God bless her! I hope, is living; jf' have not
seen her many a year j but if she'it not all
the people will be glad to see nie, and you
will easily get a lodging, Ma'mselie, and every
.thing you want.
Adeline resolved to go with - hfin ' to Sa-
voy. La Motte, who knew the ehtfftuiter
and designs of the Marquis, had'js&vfted
her to leave. the kingdom, and liad/t&d
 her, what her fear* would have su|ra|t&d,
that the Marquis would be indefatigable in
search of her. His motive for this -advice
 
 
 
 
 
§!$
THE ItOMANCK OF THE FOREST.
must be a desire of serving her; why else,
when she was already in his power, should he
remove her to soother place, and even furnish
her with money for the expenses of a journey?
At Leloncourt, where Peter said he was
well known, she would be most likely to
meet with protection and comfort, even
should his sister be dead; and its distant*
and solitary situation pleased her. These
reflections would have pointed out to her the
prudence of proceeding to Savoy, had she
been less destitute of resources in France; in
her present situation they proved it to be
necessary-
She inquired further concerning the route
they were to take, Mid whether Peter wm
sufficiently acquainted with the road. When
once I get to Thiers, I know it well enough,
said Peter; for I have gone it many a time
in my younger clays, and any body will tell
ua the way there. They travelled for several
hours in darkness and silence; and it was not
till they emerged from the forest that Adeline
§aw the morning light streak the eastern
clouds. The sight cheered and revived her;
and as she travelled silently along, her mind
revolved the events of the past night, and
meditated plans foi the future. The present
kindness of La Motte appeared bo very dif-
ferent from his former conduct, that it asto-
nished and perplexed her; and she could only
account for it by attributing it to one of those
sudden impulses of humanity which some-
times operate even upon the most depraved
hearts. •
But when she recollected his former words
—that he was not master of himself—she
could scarcely believe that mer-j pity could
induce him to break the bonds which had
hitherto so strongly held him; and then,
considering the altered conduct of the Mar-
quis, she was inclined to think that she owed
her liberty to some change in his sentiments
towards her: yet the advice La Motte had
given her to quit the kingdom, and the
money with which he had supplied her for
that purpose, seemed to contradict this opi-
nion, and involved her again in doubt
Peter now got directions to Thiers, which
place they reached without any accident* and
there stopped to refresh themselves. As soon
m Peter thought the horse sufficiently rested,
they again set forward, and from the rich plains
Gf-the Jjyonaois, Adeline for the first time
caught a view of the distant Alps, whose
majestic heads, seeming to prop the vault of
heaven, filled her mind with sublime emotions.
In a few hours they reached the vale in
•which stands the city of Lyons, whose beau-
»tiful environs, studded with villas and rich
with cultivation, withdrew Adeline from the
. melancholy contemplation of tier own circum-
stas'eos, m4 bar mow painful anxiety for
Ttoectaie*
When they reached that busy city, Iter first
care was to inquire concerning the passage of
the Rhone; but she forbore to make these
inquiries of the people of the inn, considering
that if the Marquis should trace her thither,
they might enable him to pursue her route.
She, therefore, sent Peter to the quay.^ to
hire a boat, while she herself took a slight
repast, it being her intention to embark im-
mediately. Peter presently returned, having
engaged a boat and men to take them up the
Rhone to the nearest part of Savoy, from
whence they were to proceed by land to the
Tillage of Leloncourt.
Having taken some refreshment, she ordered
him to conduct her to the vessel. A new ami
striking scene presented itself to Adeline,
who looked with surprise upon the fiver, gay
with vessels, and the quay crowded with
busy faces, and felt the contrast which the
cheerful objects around bore to herself—to
her, an orphan, desolate, helpless, and flying
from persecution and hei country. She spoke
with the master of the boat; and having .sent
Peter hack to the inn for the horse, (La
Motte's gift to Peter in lieu of some arrears
of wages,) they embarked*
As they slowly passed up the Rhone,
whose steep banks, crowned with mountains,
exhibited the most various, wild, and ro-
mantic scenery, Adeline sat in pensive reverie.
The novelty of the scene through which she
.floated, now frowning with savage grandeur,
and now smiling in fertility and gay with
towns a*:d villages, soothed her mind, and
her sorrow gradually softened into a gentle
and not unpleasing melancholy. She bad
seated herself at the head of the boat, where
she watched its sides cleave the swift stream,
and listened to the dashing of the waters.
The boat, slowly opposing the current,
passed along for some hours, and at length
the veil of evening was stretched over the
landscape. The weather was fine, and Ade-
line, regardless of the dews that now fell, re-
mained in the open air, observing the objects
darken round her, the gay tints of the horizon
fade away, and the stars gradually appear
.trembling upon the lucid mirror of the waters.
The scene was now sunk in deep shadow,
and the silence of the hour was broken only
by the measured dashing of the oars, and now
and then by the voice of Peter speaking »
the boatmen* Adeline sat lost in thought—
the forlornness of her circumstances came
heightened to her imagination.
She saw herself surrounded by the darkness
and stillness of night, in a strange place* fir
distant from any friends, going she scarcely
knew whither, under the guidance of strangers,
and pursued, perhaps, by an inveterate ene*ny-
She pictured to herself the rage of the Mai-
fluis now that he had discovered her flight;
and though-she knew it very unlikely w
30
should follow her by water, for which reason
she fiat! chosen that manner of mi veiling, she
trembled at the portrait her fancy drew. ' Uer
thought then wandered to the plan she
should adopt after reaching Savoy; anil
much as her experience had prejudiced her
against the manner** of a convent, she saw no
place more likely to afford her a proncr asy-
lum. At length she retired to the little cabin
for a few hours repose.
*She awoke with the dawtit and her mind
being too much disturbed to sdecp again, uhc
rose and watched the gradual approach of
day. As she mused, she expressed the feel-
ings of the moment in the following

When Adeline left the abbey, lift Motte
had remained for some time at the gate,
listening to the steps of the horse that carried
her, till the sound was lost in distance:
he then turned into the hall with a lightness
of heart to which he had long been a stranger.
The satisfaction of having thun preserved her,
fts he hoped, from the designs of the Marquis,
overcame for a while all sense of the danger
In which this step must involve Mm. But
when he returned entirely to his own situation,
the terrors of the Martinis'* resentment struck
their full force upon his mind, and he con-
sidered how he might best escape it.
It was now past midnight—the Marquis
was expected early on the following day; and
in this Interval it* at first appeared probable
to him that he might quit the forest. There
was only one horse; hut he considered whether
it would be bent to set off immediately for
Aubome,'wherea carriage might be procured
to convey his faintly and his moveables from
the abbey, or quietly await the arrival of the
Marquis* and endeavour to impose upon him
by a forged itory of Adeline's escape,
The time which must e!np«e before a car-
riage could reach the abbey would leave him
scarcely sufficient to escape from the forest;
what money he had remaining from the
Marquis's bounty would not carry him far;
and when it was expended be must probably
be at a lots for subsistence, .should he not
before then be detected. By remaining at
the abbey It would appear that he was nu-
conscious of deserving the Marquis's resent-
mem; and though lie could not expect to
impress a belief upon him that his orders had
been executed, he might make It appear that
Peter only had been accessary to the escape
of Adeline; an account which would seem
the more probable, from Peter's having been
formerly detected in a similar scheme. He
believed, al»o, that if the Marquis should
threaten to deliver him into the hands of jus-
tice he might save himself by a menace of
disclosing the crime be had commissioned him
to perpetrate.
Thus arguing, lift Motte resolved to re-
main at the abbey, and await the event of the
Marquis's disappointment.
When the Marquis did arrive, and was
informed of Adeline's flight, the wrong work-
ings of his soul, which appeared in his conn,
tenanoe, iot a while alarmed and terrified La
Motte. He cursed himself and her In terms"
of such ©oarserieafi and vehemence, as La
Motte was astonished to hear from a mart
whose fmnnet* were generally amiable, what-
ever might be the violence and criminality of
his passions* To invent and express these
terms seemed to give him not only relief, but
delight; yet he appeared more shocked at the
circumstance of her escape than exasperated
at tile carelessness erf 1a Motte; and recol-
lecting at length that he waited time, he left
the abbey, and dispatched eevexal of his acr-
vanta in purtiuit of her.
When he waa g»«% 1a Motte, believing
that his Story had succeeded, returned' to
the pleasure of considering that he had done
hit duty, and to the hope that Adeline
was now beyond the reach of pursuit* This
calm wia of short continuance. In a few
hours the Marquis returned, accompanied
by the officers of justice. The affrighted
La Motte, perceiving him approach, endea-
voured to conceal himself, but was seised and
carried to the Marquis, who drew him wide.
1 am not to be imposed upon, said he, by
such a superficial story as you have invented;
you know your life is in my hands; tell me
instantly where you have itecrcted Adeline,
or 1 will charge you with the crime you have
committed against me; but upon your dis-
closing the place of her concealment 1 will
dismiss the officers and, if you wish it, assist
you to leave the kingdom. You have no
time to hesitate, and may know that 1 will
cot be trifled with. 1a Motte attempted to
appease the Marquis, and affirmed that Ade-
line was really fled he knew not whither*
You will remember, my Lord, that your
character m also in my powe*; and that, if
you proceed to extremities, you will compel
me to reveal is the face of day that ftm
would have made me a murderer.
And who will believe you? said the Mat*
quis. The crimes that banished yon from

noddy will be no testimony of your veracity,
and that with which 1 now charge you, will
bring with ft a sufficient presumption that
your" accusation is malicious. Officer^, do
your duty. „
They then entered the room and seized La
Motte, whom terror .'now deprived of all -
power •• of resistance,  could resistance have
availed him; and # in the perturbation of his
mind he Inf©wned the Marquis that Adeline
had takefttfteToad'to Lyons. This discovery,
however, was made tooiate to serve himself;
the Marquis seifed the 'advantage it offered z
but the charge had been .given; and .with the
anguish of knowing. that he""''had .exposed
Adeline to danger witliout benefiting himself, _
La .Motte submitted in silence to his fate."
Scarcely allowing .'Mm time • to collect what.
little effects might easily he carried with him,
the officers 'conveyed him from the abbey;
but the Marquis, in consideration of the ex-
treme distress of Madame La Motte, directed.
one of his servants to procure a carriage from
Auboine, that she might follow her husband.
The Marquis in the mean time, now ac-
quainted with the route Adeline' had' taken,
Kent forward his faithful valet to trace .her to
her place of concealment, and return imme-
diately with'intelligence to the villa.
Abandoned to despair, La Motte and his _
wife quitted the 'forest of Fontanville, which
had for so many months afforded them an
asylum, and embarked once more, upon the
tumultuous world, where justice would meet
La Motte in the form of destruction. They
had entered the forest as a refuge, rendered
necessary by the former crimes of La Motte,
and for sometime found in it the security they
sought: but other offences, for even in that
sequestered spot there happened to be temp-
tation, soon succeeded; and his life, already
sufficiently marked by the punishment of
vice, now afforded him another instance of
this'great truth," That where guilt is, there
peace cannot enter."

AdIlinS meanwhile, and Peter, proceeded
on their voyage without any accident, _ and
landed in Savoy, where Peter placed her.upon'
tjie horse, and himself walked beside her.
When he canie within sight of his native
mountains, his extravagant joy burst forth
into" frequent exclamations, and he would
often-ask' Adeline if she had ever i seen such (
hills in France*--. No, no, said he, the' hills
there are very well for French hills, but they'
are not to be named on the same day with.
oitrs... Adeline, lost "in admiration of. the'
#$tonislting aid tremendous scenery around
her, assented very warmly to the truth of
Peter's assertion, which encouraged him to
expatiate more largely upon the advantage*
of his country; its disadvantages he totally
forgot; and though he gave away his last
sous to the children of the peasantry that ran
barefooted by the side of the horse, he spoke
of nothing but the 'happiness and content of
the inhabitants.
His native village, indeed, wai an excep.
tion to the general character of the country,
and, to the usual effects of an arbitrary govern-
ment; it wa§,if#urkhing, healthy, and happy;
and these advantages -it chiefly owed to the
activity and attention of the benevolent clergy-^
> man whose cure it was.
Adeline, who riow began to feel the effects
of long anxiety and fatigue, much wished to
arrive at the end of her journey, and inquired
irnpalSently of Peter concerning -it. Her
spirits thus weakened, the gloomy grandeur
of the scenes' which had so lately awakened
emotions of delightful sublimity, now awed
'her into terror; she trembled .<at the sound of
the torrents rolling among the cliffs and
thundering in the vale below, and shrank from
the view of the precipices, which sometimes
overhung the road and at others appeared
beneath it. Fatigued as she was, she irtw
qnently dismounted to climb on foot the
steep flinty road, which she feared to travel
on horseback.
The day was closing when they drew near
a small village at the foot of the Savoy Alps;
and the sun, in all his evening, splendour,
now sinking behind their summits, threw a
farewell gleam athwart the landscape so soft
and glowing as drew from Adeline, languid
as she was, an exclamation of rapture*
The romantic situation of the village next
attracted her notice. It stood at the foot of
several stupendous mountains, which formed
a chain round a lake at some little distance,
antl the woods that swept from their summits
almost embosomed the village* The lake,
unruffled by the lightest air, reflected ^the
vermeil tints of the horizon with the sublinu?
on its borders, darkening every instant with
the falling twilight.
When Peter perceived the village, he burst
into a shout of joy. Thank God* said he,
we are near home; there is my dear native
place: it looks just as it did twenty years
ago: antl there are the same old trees growing
round our cottage yonder, and the huge rock
that rises above it. .My poor, father died
there, Ma'mselle. Pray Heaven my sister
he alive! it is a long while since I «aw her.
Adeline listened with a melancholy pleasure
to these artless expressions of Peter, who m
retracing the scenes of his former days seemed.
to live them over ..again. As they approached
the'village', he continued'to point out varied
objects of his remembrance*. ,. And there too

Yes, Mahuselle. said the: good woman, «ueh

Ma'mselle; what shall I get you?
Adeline, who had been long struggling
with fatigue and indisposition, now yielded
to their pa-sMjre. Site said she* was indeed
ill; hut hoped that rest would re-stoic her,
and desind a bed might he immediately
prepared. The good woman went out to
obey he;-, and soon reluming showad her to

THE ROMANCE OF THE FOIIE.ST.
Early the following morning the good
woman of the house came to inquire how she
had rested? and found she had slept little, and
was much worse than on the preceding night.
The uneasiness of her mind contributed to
heighten the feverish symptoms that attended
her, And in the course of the'day her disorder
began to aisiime a serious aspect She ob-
served its progress with composure, resigning
herself to the will of God, and feeling little
to regret in life* Her kind hostess did every
thing in her power to relieve her, and there
was neither physician hot apothecary in the
village, m that nature was deprived of none
of her advantages. Notwithstanding this,
the disorder rapidly increased, and on the
third day from its first attack she became
delirious, after which she sunk into a state of
stupefaction*
How lone she remained in this deplorable
condition she knew not; hut on recovering
her Senses she found herself in-an apartment
very different front any she remembered. It
was spacious and almost beautiful, the bed
and every thing around being in one style of
elegant- simplicity. For some minutes she
lay in a trance of surprise, endeavouring to
recollect her scattered ideas of the past, and
almost fearing to move lest the pleasing vision
should vanish from her eyes.
At length she ventured to raise herself,
when she presently heard a soft Yoke speaking
near her, and Ac bed curtain on one side was
gently undrawn by a beautiful girl. As she
leaned forward over the bed, and with a smile
•of mingled tenderness and joy inquired of her
patient how she did. Adeline gazed in silent
admiration upon the most interesting female
countenance she had ever seen, in which the
expression of sweetness, united with lively
sense and refinement, was chastened by sim-
plicity.
Adeline at length recollected herself suffi-
-Ciently'to thank her kind inquirer, and begged
to know to whom she was obliged, and where
she was? The lovely girl pressed her hand,
*Tis we who are obliged, said she. Oh I how
I rejoice to find that you hate recovered your
recollection I She said no more, but flew to
the door of the apartment, and disappeared*
In a few minutes she returned with an
elderly lady, who approaching the bed with
an air of tender interest, asked concerning the
state of Adeline; to which the latter replied
as well 'as the agitation of her spirits 'would
permit, and repeated her desire of knowing
to whom «he was so greatly obliged* You
shall know that hereafter, said the My; at
present be assured that you are with those
who will think their care much overpaid by
you* recovery| submit, 'therefore, to every
thing that may conduce to it, and 'consent to
ht kept as quiet 'as possible,
- : Adeline gratefully smiled und bowed her
E
heat! in silent assent. The lady now quitted the
room for a medicine; having given which to
Adeline, the curtain was closed and she was left
to repose. But her thoughts were too busy
to suffer her to profit by the opportunity :—
she contemplated the past and viewed the
present; and when she compared them, the
contrast struck her with astonishment: the
whole appeared like one of those sudden
transitions m frequent in dreams, in which we
pass from grief and despair, we know not how,
to comfort and delight.
Yet she looked forward to the future with
a trembling anxiety that threatened to retard
her recovery, and which when she remem-
bered the words of her generous benefactress,
she endeavoured to suppress. Had she bet-
ter known the disposition of the persons In
whose house she now was, her anxiety, as far
as it regarded herself, must in a great measure
have been done away; for La Luc, its owner,
was one of those rare characters to whom mis-
fortune seldom looks in vain, and whose native
goodness, confirmed by principle, is uniform
and unassuming in its acts. The fallowing
little picture of his domestic life, his family,
and his manners, will more fully illustrate his
character. It was drawn from the life, and
its exactness will, it is hoped, compensate for
its length*

In the village of Leloncourt, celebrated for
Its picturesque situation at the foot of the Sa-
voy Alps, lived Amaml'La Luc, a'Clergy-
man descended from an ancient family of
'France, whose decayed fortunes occasioned
them to seek a retreat' in Switzerland, ^ in
an age when the violence of civil commotion
seldom spared the conquered. He was min-
ister of the village, and equally loved for the
piety and benevolence of the christian, as re-
spected for the dignity and elevation of the
philosopher. His was the philosophy of na-
ture, directed by common sense. He despised
the jargon of the -modern schools, and the
brilliant absurdities of systems which dazzled
without enlightening, and guided without
convincing their disciples, •
His mind was penetrating; his views ex-
tensive; and his- systems, like his *elig*jn,
-were simple, rational, and sublime. i|ie
people of his parish looked up to him *•*>»

fat iter; for while Ills pmv^>te directed their
minds, his example touched their hearts.
In curly youth La Luc lost a wife whom
he tenderly loved. This event threw a tinc-
ture of soft *o*i interesting melancholy over
his character, which remained when time had
mellowed the remembrance that occasioned it.
Philosophy bud strengthened, not hardened,
Id* heart; it ctiahled him to resist the pres-
sure of affliction, rather than to overcome it.
Calamity taught him to foel with peculiar
sympathy the distresses of others. His in.
come from the parish was small, and what rc>
mained from the divided and reduced estates
of Ills ancestors did not much increase it; but
though lie could not always relieve the neces-
sities of the indigent, his tender pity and
holy conversation seldom tailed in administer-
ing consolation to the mental sufferer. On
these occasion* the sweet and exquisite emo-
tions, of his heart have often induced him to
say, that could the voluptuary he once sensi**
We of these feelings, he would never after fore-
go the luxury of doing good. Ignorance of true
pleasure* he would say, more frequently than
temptation to that which is false, leads to vice*
La Luc had one son and a daughter, who
were too young when their mother died tola*
incut their loss. lie loved them with pecu-
liar tenderness, as the children of her whom
he never ceased to deplore; and it was for
some time his sole amusement to observe the
gradual unfolding of their infant minds, and
to bend them to virtue. His was the deep and
silent borrow of the heart; his complaints he
never obtruded upon others, and very seldom
did he even mention his wife. His grief wan
too sacred for the eye of the vulgar. Often
he retired to the deep solitude of the moun-
tains, and amid their solemn and tremendous
scenery would brood over the remembrance of
times past, and Tesign himself to tde luxury
of grief. On his return from these little ex-
cursions he wat* always more placid and con-
tented. A sweet tranquillity, which arose
almost to happiness, was diffused over his
mind, and his manners were more than usually
benevolent. As he gazed on his children,
and fondly kissed them, a tear would wme-
times Meal into his eye; hut it was a tear of
tender regret, unmingled with the darker
qualities of sorrow, and was most precious to
bis heart.
On the death of Ms wife he received into his
house a maiden sister, a sensible, worthy wo-
man, who was deeply interested in the hap-
piness of her brother. Her affectionate atten-
tion and judicious conduct anticipated the
.cftcct of time in softening the poignancy of
his distress; and her unremitted care of his
children, while it proved the goodness of her
awn heart, attracted her more closely to his.
It was with inexpressible pleasure that he
traced in the infant features of Claw the *e-
suithlunce of her mother. The same gentle*
nvss of manner and the same sweetness of
disposition soon displayed themselves; and
us she grew up, her actions frequently re-
minded him i» strongly of his lost wife as- to
fix him in reveries, which absorbed all his soul.
Kngaged in the duties of his parish, the
education of his children, arid in philosophic
research, his years passed in tranquillity.'
The tender melancholy with which affliction
had tinctured bin mind, was by long indul-
gence become dear to him, and he would not
have relinquished it for the brightest dream
of airy happiness. When any passing inci-
dent disturbed him, he retired for consolation
to the idea of her he so faithfully loved, and
yielding to a gentle, and what the world
would call a romantic, sadness, gradually rti-
assumul his composure. This was the secret
luxury to which he withdrew from temporary
disappointment—the solitary enjoyment which
dissipated the cloud of care, and blunted the
sting of vexation—which elevated his mind
uho\e this world, and opened to his view the
sublimity of another.
The spot he now inhabited, the surround-
ing scenery, the romantic beauties of the
neighbouring walks, were dear to La Luc, for
they had once been loved by Clara; they had
been the scenes of her tenderness, and of his
happiness,
Xiis chateau stood on the borders of a small
lake that was almost environed by mountains
of stupendous height, which, shooting into a
variety of grotesque forms, composed a scentry
singularly solemn and sublime. Dark woods
intermingled with bold projections of rock,
sometimes barren and sometimes covered with
the purple bloom of wild flowers, impended
over the lake, and were seen in the clear,mir-
ror of its waters. The wild unci alpine heights
which rose above, were either crowned with
perpetual snows, or exhibited tremendous
craigs and masses of solid redk, whose ap.
pearance was continually changing'as the rays
of light were variously reflected on their stir-
face, and whose summits were often wrapt in
impenetrable mists, Some cottages and ham*
. lets, scattered ©n the margin of the lake or
seated in picturesque points of view on ,the
rocks above, were the only objects that
reminded the beholder of humanity.
On the side of the lake, neatly opposite to
the chateau, the mountains receded, and a long
chain of Alps was seen stretching in perspect he.
Their innumerable tints and- shades, some
veiled in blue mists, some tinged with ricii
, purple, and others glittering-in'partial light,
guve luxurious and magical flouring to the
scene*
The chateau was Hot large, but it was,con-
ventent, and was characterized by an nir 'of
elegant simplicity and good order.,, Thg eg,

, Behind the- chateau rose a '.tuft of pines,
;and' in'front-a gentle .declivity, covered with
verdure and lowers, extended to the, lake,
whose waters lowed even with the grass, and
gave freshness to the -acacias that waved
#ver - its surface. Flowering shrubs, inter-
mingled with mountain-ash, cypress, and
ever-green oak, marked: the boundary of the
garden.
 'At the return of spring it was Clara's care
to direct the young shoots of the plants,
to nurse the budding flowers, and to shelter
theai with the luxuriant, branches of the
shrubs from the cold blasts that descended
from the mountains.  In summer she usually
 mm with the sun, and visited her favourite
• "flowers, while the dew yet hung glittering on
- tlustr leaves. The freshness of early day,
jwith the , glowing. colouring which then
 touched the scenery, gave a pure and exqui-

scenes of grandeur .and sublimity, she had

.- earliest pleasures of which Clara was suscep-

-.-taste for' poetry' and painting. When she

,, /.Young' La, Luc played the ,l»ti, mi she
Iwtehed to 'him with exquisite delight, pai?
tkuiarly" when he stood'on 'the' margin of ife
lake, under 'her beloved 'acacias. " Her' voice
was sweet and flexible, though not strong,
and «he soon' learned' to hiodulate it to" the
.instrument. -She knew nothing of the in-
tricacies of execution; her airs were, simple,
and her 'Style equally so; but she m»n g;i?e
them a touching expression, inspired by the
sensibility of her heart,. which seldom . left
those of tier hearers unaffected.
It was the happiness • of 'La _Luc to see Ms
children happy; and In one of his excursions
to Geneva, whither be went to visit _ some
relations of his late wife, he bought Clara, a
lute. Hhe received it with more gratitude
-than- she could express; and having, learned
one air, she hastened to her favourite acaciax,
and played it again and again till she furgot
every thing besides. Her little ' domestic
duties, her books, her drawing, even the
hour which her father dedicated to, her ini-
firovement,' when she met her brother in the
ibrary, and with him partook of knowledge,
even this hour passed unheeded by. i La Luc
suffered it to pass. Madame was displeased
that her niece neglected her domestic duties,
and wished to reprove her, but La Luc
begged she would be silent. Let experience
teach her her error, said he, precept.seldom
brings conviction to young minds.
Madame objected that experience was a
slow teacher. It. is a sure, one, replied .La
Luc, and is not unrrequently the quickest of
all teachers: when it cannot lead us into
serious evil, it is well to trust to it.
The second day passed with Clara as the
.first, and the third as the second. ,She could
now play several tunes; she came to her
father and repeated what she had learnt.
At supper the cream was not dressed, and
there was no fruit on the table.; La Luc
inquired the reason; Clara recollected it, and
blushed. She observed that her brother was
-absent, but nothing was' said. Toward the
conclusion of the repast he appeared; his
countenance expressed unusual satisfaction,
but he seated himself in silence. Clara in-
• quired what had detained Mm from supper*
and learnt that he had been to a sick family
in the neighbourhood with the weekly allow-
ance which her father gave them... La Luc
had intrusted the care of this family to his
daughter, and it was her duty to have car-
ried them their little aEowance on the prece-
ding day, but she had forgotten every thing
but music.
.  How did you find the woman,? said La
Luc to his son. Worse, Sir, he replied; for
her medicines had not been regularly given and
•the children,had had little or -no food to-day.

This, lute is my delight, and my torment!
This reflection occasioned her much internal
debate; but he tote she could come to any re-
solution upon tba point in question, she fell
asleep.
She awoke very curly the next morning.
and impatiently watched the progress of the
dawn. The sun at length appearing, she arose,

her power for her former neglect, hastened t&
the cottage.

sweetly would the song I learned yesterday
sound now over the waters! But she re.
mem bored her determination, and cheeked
the step nhe was involuntarily talcing towards
the chateau.
She attended her father in the library at
the usual hour, and learned from his discourse
with her brother on what had been read the two
preceding days, that she had lost much enter.
taining knowledge. She'requested her father
Would inform her to what this conversation
alluded; but he calmly replied, that she had
preferred another amusement at the time
when the subject was discussed, and must
therefore content herself with Ignorance,
You would reap the rewards of study from the
amusements of Idleness, said he; learn to be

remembered her lute. What mischief has it

THE KOMANCK.OF TflK FOKKST.
She then recollected all tliat her father had
at different times sulci on the subject of fcelf-
command, and she felt some pain.
No, said the, if I do not consider that to
preserve a resolution, which I have once
qolemnly formed, is* a sufficient reason • to
control mj inclinations, I fear no other mo-
tive woftid long restrain me. 1 seriously
determined not .to touch my lirte this whole
day, and 1 have broken my resolution. To*
morrow perhaps I may he tempted to neglect
some duty, for I have discovered that I can-
riot rely on my own prudence. Since I cannot
conquer temptation, 1 will fly from it.
On the following morning she brought her
lute to La Luc, and begged he would receive
it again, and at least keep it ^till she had
taught her inclinations to submit to control.
The heart of La Luc swelled as she spoke.
No, Clara, said he, it is unnecessary that 1
should receive your lute; the sacrifice you
would make proves you worthy of my con-
fidence. Take hack the instrument; since
you have sufficient resolution to resign it
when it leads you from duty, I doubt not
that you wIE be able to control its influence
now that it is restored to you.
Clara felt a degree of pleasure and pride at
these words, such as she had never before
experienced ; hut she thought, that to deserve
t|e commendation they bestowed, it was nc
cwsary to complete the sacrifice she had begun*
|ti the. virtuous enthusiasm of the moment
die delights of music were forgotten in those
of aspiring to well-earned praise; and 'When
she refused the lute thus offered, she was*
conscious only of exquisite sensations. Dear
Sir, said she, tears of pleasure, swelling in
her cyoi, allow me to deserve the praises you
bestow, and then I shall indeed be happy.
1* Luc thought she had never resembled
her mother so much as at this instant, and
tenderly kissing her, he for some moments
wept in silence. When he was able to speak,
You do already deserve my praises, said he,
and I restore your lute as a reward for the
conduct which excites them. This scene
called hack recollections too tender -for the
heart of La Luc, and giving Clara the instru-
ment, he abruptly quitted the room.
La Luc's son, a youth of much promise,
was designed by his father for the church,
and had received from him an excellent edu-
cation, which, however, it was thought neces-
sary he should finish at an university. That
of Geneva was fixed upon by La Luc. His
gcheme had been to make his son not a scholar
only; he was ambitious that he should also
he enviable as a mam From early infancy
he had accustomed him to hardihood and en-
durance, and as he advanced in youth, he
encouraged him in manly exercises, and ac*
quainted him with the useful arts as wcM as
with abstract science*
lie was high-spirited and ardent in bis
temper, but his heart was generous and afilv-
tionate. He looked forward to Geneva, and
to the new world it would disclose, with the
sanguine expectations of youth; and in the
delight of these expectations was absorbed the
regret he would otherways have lilt at a
separation from his family.
A brother, of the late Madame La Luc,
who was by birth an Englishman, resided
at Geneva with his family. To have been
related to his wife was a sufficient claim upon
the heart of La Luc, and he had therefore
always kept up an intercourse with' Mr.
Audley, though the difference in their cha-
racters and manner of thinking would never
permit this association to advance into friend-
ship. La Luc now wrote to him, signifying
an intention of sending his son to Geneva,
and recommending him to his care. To this.
letter Mr. Audley returned a friendly answer;
and a short time after, an acquaintance of
La Luc's being called to Geneva, he deter-
mined that his .son should accompany him.
The separation was painful to La Luc, and
almost insupportable to Clara* Madame was
grieved, and took care that he should have a
sufficient quantity of medicines put up in his
travelling trunk; she was also at some pain,**
to point out their virtues, and the different
complaints for which they were requisite; but
she was careful to deliver her lecture during
the absence of her brother.
La Luc, with his daughter, accompanied
his son on horseback to the next town, which
was about eight miles from Leloncourt; and
there again enforcing all the advice he had
formerly given him respecting his conduct
and pursuits, and again yielding to the tender
weakness of the father, tie bade him farewell
Clara wept, and felt more sorrow at this part-
ing than the occasion could justify; but this
was almost the first time she had known
grief, and she artlessly yielded to its influ-
La Luc and Clara travelled pensively bacfc,
and the day was closing when they came
within view of the lake, and soon after of the
chateau. Never had it appeared gloomy till
now; but now Clara wandered forlornly
through every deserted apartment where, she
had been accustomed to see her brother, and
recollected a thousand little circumstances
which, had he been present, she would have
thought immaterial, but on which imagina-
tion now stamped a value- The garden, the
scenes around, all wore a melancholy aspect,
and it was long ere they resumed their natural
character and Clara recovered her vivacity.
Near four years had elapsed since this
separation, when one evening, as Madame
La Luc and her niece were sitting at ^ wort
together in the parlour, a good woman in the
neighbourhood desired to be admitted. Wie
 
 
Idf
came to mk for some medicine*, nnd the ad-
xice of Madame La Lite. Here is a sad
accident happened at mit houses Madame,
miA she; I am sure my heart ache* tor the
poor young creature—Madame tm Luc dc»
slft'd ilie 'would explain herself, and the
woman proceeded to say that her brother
Peter, whom she had not seen for so many
years, was arrived, and had brought a young
hdf to her cottage, who she verily believed
was dying. She described her disorder, arid
acquainted Madame with wfiat particulars of
her mournful story Peter had related, failing
not to exaggerate such as her coin passion for
the unhappy stranger and her love of the
marvellous prompted.
The account appeared a very extraordinary
one to Madame; but pity for the forlorn
condition oi* the young sufferer induced her
to inquire further into the affair. Do let me
go to her, Madame, said Clara, who had been
listening with ready compassion to the poor
woman's narrative; Do suffer me to »>—she
must want comforts, and 1 wish much to sec
how she in. Madame asked some further
questions concerning her disorder, and then,
taking off* her spectacles, she rose from her
chair, and said sne would go herself. Clara
desired to accompany tier. They put on
their kits and followed the good woman to
the cottage, where, in a very small close
room, on a miserable bed, lay Adeline, pale,
emaciated, and unconscious of all around
her. Madame turned to the woman, and
asked how long she hud been in this way,
while tiara went up to the bed, and taking
the almost lifeless hand that lay on the quilt,
looked anxiously in her face. &he observes
nothing, said she, poor creature! 1 wish
she was at the chateau, she would be better
accommodated, and I could nurse her there.
The woman told Madame La Luc that the
young lady had lain in that state for several
fiotirs. Madame examined her pulse, and
shook lier head. This room is very close,
*aid she—Very close indeed, cried Clara
eagerly; surely she would be better at the
chateau, if she could be moved.
We will see about that, said her aunt In
the mean lime let me speak to Peter; it is
borne years since 1 saw him. Hhe went to
the outer room, and the woman ran out of
the cottage to look for him. When she was
gone, This k a miserable habitation for the
poor stranger, said Clara; she will never be
well here; do, Madame, ht her be carried to
our house; 1 am sure my father would wish
it. Besides, there is something in her fea-
tures, even inanimate as they now are, that
prejudices me in her favour.
Shall 1 never persuade yon to give tip that
romantic notion of judging people by their
faces f said her aunt. What sort of a face
the lias is of very little eonsequenw^hcr
condition is lamentable, and 1 am desirous
of altering it; but I wish first to ask Peter
a few questions concerning her.
Thank you, my dear aunt, laid Clara;
she will be removed then. 'Madame Ia hut
was going to reply; but Peter Trow entered,
and expressing great Joy at seeing her again,
inquired how Monsieur Ija Luc and Clara
did. Clara immediately welcomed' honest
Peter to his native place, and he returned
her salutation with many expressions of stir-
frise at finding her so much pratvtk. Though
have so often dandled yon in my anas,
Ma'mscllc, I should never have known yon
again: Young twigs shoot fast, as they Bay.
Madame La Luc now inquired into tfio
particulars of Adeline's story; and heard m
inueh a* Peter knew of it, being only that
his late master found her "in a very distressed
situation, and that he had himself brought
her from the abbey to save her from a French
Marquis. The simplicity of Peter's manner
would not suffer her to question his veracity,
though some of the circumstances he related
excited all her surprise and awakened all her
pity. "Team frequently stood in Clara's eyes
during the course of his narrative; and
when lie concluded, she said, Dear Madame,
1 am sure when my father learns the 'history
of this unhappy young woman he will not
refuse to be a parent to her, and 1 will be
her sister.
She deserves it all, said Peter, for she ($
very good indeed. He then proceeded in a
strain of paise which was very unusual
with him,—1 will go home and consult with
my brother about her, said Madame La Luc$
rising; me certainly ought to be removed to
a more airy room. The chateau is m near,
that 1 think she may be carried thither with-
out much risk.
Heaven blew you 1 Madam, cried Fe4e%
rubbing his hands, for your goodness to wf
poor young lady.  -
Ln Luc had just returned from his evening
walk when they reached the chateau. Ma»
dame told him where she bad been, and're*
lated the history of Adeline and her present
condition.*—By all means have her removed
hither, said La Luc, whose eyes bore testi-
mony to the tenderness of his heart i she can
he better attended to here than in Susan's
cottage.
I knew you would say so, my dear father,
said Clara: I will go and order the green bed
to be jrrepared for her.

there is no occasion for such --hante: some
things are to be  considered first; but yon'

Adeline, assisted by a fine constitution,
and the kind attentions of her new friends,
was-frt^a little more than a week so much re-
covered as ' to leave her chamber. She was
'Introduced'to La Luc,' whom she met with
teak of gratitude, and thanked' for his good-
'ttess M a manner m warm, yet so artless, as
Interested him still more in her favour. Dur-
1 tag'the progress of her recovery, the sweet-
nesWof her behaviour' had entirely won the
'heart':of'Clara, and greatly interested that of
her aunt, whose reports' of Adeline, together
• with;thV praises bestowed by Clara, 'had ex-
cited ' both esteem and curiosity in the breast
of La Luc | and he now met her with an
^Jbres^Ion' ;of benignity which spoke peace
••'ana cortifort to her- heart. She had acquaint-
^."Maaamo :La Luc with such particulars of
'her fctorjr as' Petef, either through ignorance
ifc inattention,' had not communicated, sup-
'prmfiiff only, through a false delicacy per-
haps, an acknowledgment of her attachment
to Theodore, These circumstances were re-
peated to La Luc, who, ever sensible to the
sufferings of others* was -particularly inter-
ested by the ^ingttlar misfortunes-of Adeline.
JSeat.ia. fortnight' had* elapsed since her
removal to the chateau, when one morning La
Lu^j^si^eito.sjpeak with her alone. She foi»
loweft rhiai- 'into 'his 'etudy, and then' in'- a
thanner>'the';most^deliieate''hb told;h«, that as
he fouM she was -so unfortunate in her father,
he i#§ttred'"$b#-would henceforth Consider him
m her pa«j|%, aUdthis house. As be* home.! "1roa
and. Clara shall be equally my daughter*,
continued he; I am. rich in having such
children.. The strong emotions of surprise
and gratitude for some lime kept - Adeline
silent. -Bo not thank me, said In Luc; 1
know all,you would say, and I know aLio
that 1 am but doing- my duty: I thank, (hnl
that my duty, and my pleasures are generally
in unison. Adeline wiped away the tears
which his goodness had excited, and wa»
foing to speak j but La Luc pressed lief
and, and turning away to conceal his emo-
tion, walked out of the room.
Adeline was  now considered as a part of
the family; and in the parental .kindness of
La Luc, the sisterly affection of Clara, and
the steady and uniform regard of Madame,
she would have been happy as she was thankr
ful, had not unceasing anxiety for, the fate of
Theodore, of whom in this, solitude she wan
less likely than ever. to hear, corroded her
'heart, and embittered every moment of re-
flection. Even when sleep obliterated fur
awhile the memory of the past, his linage
frequently arose to her fancy, accompanied
by all the exaggerations of terroi. She. saw
him in chains, and struggling in the grasp
of ruffians, or saw him led, amidst the
dreadful preparations for execution, into tlw
ield: she saw the agony. of Ms look, and
beard him repeat her name in frantic .accents,
till the horrors of the scene overcame her and
she awoke.
A similarity of taste and character attach-
ed her to Clara; yet the misery that preyed
upon her heart was of a nature too delicate to
.be spoken of* and she never mentioned Theo-
dore even to her friend. Her illness had yet
left her weak and languid, and the perpetual
anxiety of her mind contributed, to prcv
long this .state. She endeavoured.by strong
and almost continual efforts to .abstract her
thoughts from their mournful subject, and
was often successful. La Luc had an excel-
, lent library, and the instruction it offered at
once gratified her love of knowledge, and
withdrew her mind from painful recollections.
His conversation , too afforded, her another
refuge from misery, .
..But, her chief,amusement was to wander
among the sublime scenery of the adjacent
country, sometimes with Clara,..though often
with no other companion than a book. There
were indeed times when the conversation of
her friend imposed a painful ^restraint, and,
when, given up, to reflection, she would
.ramble , alone, through scenes,whose solitary
-grandeur assisted, and soothed the melancholy
«of :her heart* Her© she would retrace all the
conduct .of her beloved Theodore, and endea-
vour to recollect his exact countenance! hi*»
air and manner. .Now she-would weep ty
the remembrance, and then, suddenly coji-
'$idering that he-had:pexhap$ already suffered

1*51 !giu>miuiou.s death for Iter sake, even in
consequence of the very action which*, hit!
proved his love, a dreadful 'despair would
seize her, atul, am-sting Iut 'team, ' would
threaten to bear down every barrier that
foriittmV • and reason could oppose.
Fearing longer to trust her, own thoughts,
ilie would hurry 'home, and by it desperate
tflhrt would try to lose, in the conversation of
Jbft 1/uc, the remembrance of the past. Her
melancholy, when he observed it, La Luc
attributed to a sense of the cruel treatment
'she had received from lie? father4 » circum-
stance which, by exciting his compassion,
endeared her more strongly to his heart;
'•while that love of rational conversation,
•which In her calmer hours so frequently ap-
peared, opened to him a new Mourcc of amuse-
ment in the cultivation of a mind eager for
knowledge, and susceptible of all the ener-
gies of genius. She found, a melancholy
pleasure in listening to the soft* tones of
'Clara's lute, and would often soothe her
mind by attempting to repeat th* airs she
'heard.
The gentleness of her manners, partaking
so much of that pensive character which
marked La Luc% wm soothing to his heart',
nfad tinctured his behaviour with a degree of
-tenderness that imparted comfort to her, anil
-gradually won her entire confidence and-affec-
tion. She saw with extreme concern the de-
clining slate of his health, and united her
eftfert* with those of the family to amuse and
'revive him.
The pleasing uociety of which she partook,
'and the quictm*s of the country, at length
rcMoTed Iter mind to-a state of tolerable com-
•postire. She was now acquainted with all
the wild*walks of the neighbouring moun-
tains; and never tired of viewing their
astonishing scenery, she often indulged hcr-
*»f#li' in traversing alone their unfrequented
path*, where now and then a peasant from a
-neighbouring village was all that interrupted
'the profound solitude. She generally took
with her a book, that if she" perceived her
Uiriught 'inclined to fix on the one object of
her grief, she might force them to & subject
less -dangerous to her peace, f-%e had become
a tolerable proficient in English while at tile
convent where she resefved her education, and
the instruction of la. line, who was well ac-
quainted with the language, now served to
perfect her. He wm partial to the English";
he admired their character, and the constitu-
tion of their law*, and his library contained
a collection of their best authors, particularly
<tf their philosophers and poets. Adeline
found that no species of writing had power
» effectually to withdraw her mind from the
contemplation of Its own misery as the "higher
kinds of poetry, and in these her taste mm
taught her to* distinguish the superiority of
the English from that. o> tile ltaftnchv '.$%*
genius of the language, more perhaps" Am
the genius of the 'people, if'indeed the di*i
tinetion may be allowed, occasioned this.,'
She frequently took a' volume of $h»fc»*
peare or of Milton, and, having gained tbkne
wikl eminence, wotild seat herself benem-dl
the pines, whose low murmurs soothed -tuNt
heart, and conspired with the Vitiiorj* of the
poet to lull her to forgetfulnesti of;|fief.'  ,:
One evening,' when (Mm 'Wis etigaged 'fct
home, Adeline wandered atone to ft ftVouHtli
spot among the rocks that bordered ''tfta lata**
11 was an eminence which commanded an<-en>
tire view of the lake, and ef the atupendott*
mountains that environed it. A few lagged
thorns grew from the precipe*' >beiieat)t,
which descended pexpendieuWly • to '-the
water's edge; and above rose'1* thickiWod
of larch, pine, arid fir, intermingled with
some cheanut and mountain ash. . The even-
ing was fine, and the air mi still that- it
scarcely waved the "light leaves of the tareee
around, or rippled the broad expanse of the
waters below. Adeline gazed on the scene
with a kind of still rapture, and watched the
Bun sinking amid a crimson glow, .which
tinted the bosom of the lake and the snowy
.heads of the distant Alps* . The delight
which the scenery inspired,
Soothing each rust of passion Into peacl,
AH but the vweilttigK of the soften'd heart,
Tuatwak«u, not disturb, the tranquil mind';
was now heightened l>y the tones of a Jfyench
horn, and, looking, on the lake^ she per-
ceived at some distance a pleasure-boat. i ,Ji»
it was a spectacle -rather uncommon in' this
solitude, she concluded the boat contained; ft
party of foreigners conic to view the wonder-
ful _ scenery of the country, ox perhaps of
Clcftevois, who choose to amuse themselves on
a lake m grand, though much less extensive,
'ban their own; and the latter conjecture yas
probably just i ,, •_,'.
As she listened to the mellow andenc&ani*
- ing tones of the horn, which gradually sswA
away in distance, the scene appeared' tpoii*
lovely than before; and finding it impoisiMje
to forbear attempting, to paint in Ifngaa^e

, La Luc observing how much Adeline was
charmed with the features of the country,
and desirous of amusing her melancholy,
which, notwithstanding he? efforts, was often
too apparent, wished to show her other
scenes than those to which her walks were
circumscribed. He proposed a party on
horseback to take a nearer view of the Gla-
ciers; to attempt their ascent was a difficulty
and fatigue to which neither La Luc, in his
present state of health, nor Adeline were
•qual. She had not been-accustomed to ride
•ingle, and the mountainous road they were
'to' pass made the experiment rather danger-
ous; but she concealed her fears, and they
were not sufficient to make her wish to-forgo
an enjoyment such as was now offered her.
The following day was fixed for this ex-
clusion. La lane and his patty arose at an
early hour, and having taken a slight break-
fast, they set out towards the Glacier of
Montanvcrt, which lay at a few leagues dis-
tance. Peter carried a small basket of pro.
visions; and It was their plan to dine on
tome pleasant spot in the open air.
It is unnecessary to describe the high en-
thusiasm of Adeline, the more complacent
.pleasure- of La Luc, and the transports of
Clara, as the scenes of this romantic country
shifted to their eyes. Now frowning in dark
"and gloomy grandeur, it exhibited only tre-
mendous- rocks and cataracts rolling from the
heights • into some deep and narrow valley,
along which their united waters roared and
foamed, and burst away to regions inacces-
aibfe to mortal foot j and now the scene arose
less fiercely wild {
the pomp.of groves and, garniture of fields
ware Intermingled with the ruder features of
nature•; and while the snow froze on the
summit of the mountain* the tine blushed
atittiboV
• 'Engaged in interesting conversation, and
by the admiration which the country excited,
they travelled on till noon, when they looked
round for a pleasant spot where they might
rest and take refreshment. At some little
distance they perceived the rains of a fabric
which had once been a castle; it stood almost
on a point of rock that overhung t 4ecp
valley; and its broken turrets rising from
among the woods that embosomed it,
heightened the picturesque beauty of the
object.
The edifice invited curiosity, and the
shades repose—La Luc and his party ad-
vanced."
Deep struck with awa thejr mark'd the dome o*er*
thrown.
Where once the beauty bloonYd, the warrior shone t
They saw the castle's mouldering towers deeayM,
The loose stone totterutgo'er the'trembling shade.
They seated themselves on the grass under
the shade of some'high trees near the ruins.
An opening in the woods afforded a view of
the distant Alps—the deep silence of solitude
reigned, For some time they were lost in
meditation. Adeline felt a sweet complacency*
such as she had long been a stranger to,
Ix>oking at La Luc, she_ perceived a tear
stealing down his cheek, while the elevation
of his mind was strongly expressed on his
countenance. He turned on Clara his eyes,
which were now Ailed with tenderness, and
made an effort to recover himself.
The stillness and total seclusion,, of this
scene, said Adeline, those stupendous moun*
tains, the gloomy grandeur of these woods,
together with that monument of faded glory
on which the hand of time is so emphatically
impressed, diffuse a sacred enthusiasm over
the mind, and awaken sensations truly sub-
lime.
La Luc was going to speak; but Peter
coming forward, desired to know whether lie
had not better open the wallet, as he fancied
his honour and the young ladies must be
main hungry, jogging on so far up hill and
down- before dinner. They acknowledged the
truth of honest Peter's suspicion, and ac*
cepted his hint
Refreshments were spread on the grass;
and having seated themselves under the ca-
nopy of waving woods, surrounded by the
sweets of wild flowers, they inhaled the pure
breeze of the Alps, which might be called
spirit of air, and partook of a repast which
these circumstances rendered delicious.
When they arose to depart,—-1 am unwill-
ing, said Clara, to quit this charming spot
How delightful would it be to pass one's
life beneath these shades with the friends
who are dear to one !—La Luc smiled at the
romantic simplicity of the idea ;• but Adeline
sighed deeply to the image of felicity and
of Theodore which it recalled, and turned
away to conceal her tears.
. They now mounted their horses, aud soon
after arrived at the foot of Montanvert The
emotions of Adeline, as she contemplated in
various points of view the astonishing objects
around her, surpassed all expression; and
 
 
 
 
1*1
the feelings 'of the whole- party were too
strong to admit at conversation. The pro-
found stillness which reigned in these regions
of solitude inspired awe, and heightened the
sublimity of the scenery to an e-\quwite do*
grce.
It seems, said Adeline, m If we were walk-
Inc over the ruins of the world, and were the
only persons who had survived the wrer.k. I
can scarcely persuade iii)nelf that we are not
left alone on the globo.
The view of these objects, said 1Ui Luc,
lift the soul to their Great Author, 'tnci wc
contemplate with a feeling almost too vast
for humanity—the sublimity of his nature in
the grandeur of his works.—-La Luc raised
liis eyes, filled with tears, to heaven, and
wm for some moments lost in silent adoration.
They quitted these scenes with extreme re-
luctance; but the hour of the day, and the
appearance of the clouds, which seemed
gathering for a storm, made them hasten
their departure. Could she have been shel-
tered from ite fury, Adeline almost wished
to have witnessed the tremendous effect of a
thunder storm in these regions.
They returned to Lcloncourt by a different
route, and the shade of the overhanging pre-
cipices was deepened by the gloom of the
atmosphere. It was evening when they came
within view of the lake, which the travellers
rejoiced to nee, for the storm so long threat-
ened was now fast approaching; the thunder
murmured among the Alps; and the dark
vii|»uw that rolled heavily along their sides
heightened tbtir dreadful sublimity. La Luc
would have quickened hia pace, hut the road
winding down the steep wide of a mountain
made caution necessary. The darkening air
And the lightnings that now flashed along
the horixon terrified Clara, but she withheld
the expression of her fear in consideration of
her father. A peal of thunder, which seem-
ed to shake the earth to its foundations, and
was reverberated in tremendous echoes from
the cliff's, hurst over their heads, Clara's
horse took fright at the sound, and setting
off, hurried her with amar.ing velocity down
the mountain towards the lake, which wash-
ed its foot. The agony of La Luc, who
viewed her progress in the horrible expecta-
tion of leetag her dashed down the precipice
that bordered the road, is not to be described.
Clara kept her neat, but terror had almost
deprived her of sense. Her efforts to pre-
serve herself were mechanical, for she scarcely
knew what, she did. The horse, however,
carried her safely almost to the foot of the
mountain, but was making towards the lake,
when a gentleman who travelled' along the
road caught the bridle as the animal endea-
voured to pass. The sudden stopping of the
horse threw Clara to the ground, and, Impa-
tient of restraint, the animal burst from the
hand of the stranger, and plunged into the
lake. The violence of the fall deprived li«
of recollection; but while the stranger co-
des voured to support Iter, his servant ran tp
fetch water.' . •
She soon recovered, and unclosing her eye*
found herself in the arms of a chevalier, who
apiwared to support her with difficulty. 'The'
coin passion expressed in his countenance
while he Inquired how she did, revived. In*
spirits; and she was endeavouring to thank,
him for his kindness, when La Lwr and
Adeline came up. The terror' impressed o*
her father's features was perceived by Clara;
languid as she was, she tried to raise herself,
and said with a faint smile, which betrayed
instead of disguising her sufferings* Hear
Sir, 1 am not hurt. Her pale countenance
and the blood that trickled down her chefk
contradicted her words. But La Luc, to
whom terror had suggested the utmost pos-
sible evil, now rejoiced'to hear-her speak fiie
recalled some prcsencs of mind, and while
Adeline applied her salts* he chafed hor
temples*  
When she revived^ she told him 'bow
much she was obliged to the stranger. La
Luc endeavoured to express his gratitude $
but the former interrupting him, begged he
might be spared the pain of receiving thanks
for having followed only aft impulse of com-
mon humanity. , , ,
They were now not far from Leloneourt;
but the evening was almost shut in, and the
thunder murmured deeply among the hills*
La Luc was distressed how to convey Clam
home.
Jn endeavouring to raise her 'from'-the
ground, the stranger betrayed such evident
symptoms of pain, that La Luc inquired
concerning it The sudden jerk'which the
horse had given the arm of the chevalier, itt
escaping from his hold, had violently sprain*
ed his shoulder, and rendered his arm almost
useless. The pain was exquisite; -and La
Luc, whose fears for hi*1 laughter wefe now
subsiding, was shocked at the circumstance,
ai-d pressed the stranger to accompany him- to'
the village, where relief might be obtained-.
He accepted the invitation; and Clara, being
at length placed on a horse led by her father,
was conducted to the chateau. .
When Madame, who had,been looking
out for La Luc some  time, perceived the
cavalcade approaching, gh© was alarmed, ,aad
her apprehensions were confirmed, when *he
saw the situation of her niece* Cla** was
carried into the house, and La Lie would
have gent for a surgeon, but there.wurnone
within several leagues of the village,  nelthae
were there any of the physical profession
within the same distance. Clara was.assjsted
to her chamber by Adeline, and Madame $m

La Lac, whose spirits had suffered much
perturbation, was now tranquillized by the re-

tewed to her closet; and it is perhaps difhYuIt
to determine whether she folt moat #oncern

at the opportunity thus offered of displaying

she quitted the room with great alacrity, and

La Lue insisted that the chevalier, M.
Venieuil, should not leave the chateau that
night, and he very readily submitted to be de-
tained. Hia manners during the evening
were'as frank and engaging as the, hospitality
and gratitude of La Luc were sincere, and
they soon-entered into interesting ftonversatioft.
M* Vemeutt conversed like a man who had
wet much, and thought more $ and if he dis-
covfted any prejudice in his opinions, it was
evidently the prejudice of a mind which, see-
ing  objects through the medium of nis own
goodness, tinges them with the hue of its pre-
dominant quality. La Luc was much-pleased,
for in his retired iitustion he had not often an
opportunity of -receiving the pleasure which
ftmdts from 'A communion of intelligent
minds, -He found that M. Vemeuil had
travelled. La Lue having asked some ques-
tions relative to England, they fell into dis-
course concerning tne national characters of
the French-and English,
; If It I* the privilege of wisdom, said M.
Vtmsuil, to look beyond happiness, I ©we

quency of suicide among them, we are apt to

pauble. If, on the other hand, we turn to
their neighbours, the French, and see* their
wretched' policy, their spsrkiiag but sophisti-
cal discourse, frivolous occupations, aid,
withal, their gay animated air, we shall be
compelled to acknowledge that happiness and
folly too often dwell together.
It is the end of wisdom, said La Luc, to at*
tain happiness, and I can hardly dignify that
conduct -or course of thinking which tends to
misery with the name of wisdom. By this
rule, perhaps, the folly, m we term it, of the
French-deserves, since its effect is happing
to he called wisdom. That Airy thoughtless*
ness, which alike to contemn reflection and
anticipation, produces all the effect of it with-
out reducing its subjects to the mortification
of philosophy. But in truth wisdom is an
•exertion of mind to subdue folly; and as the
happiness of the French is less the conse-
quence of mind than of constitution, it de*
serves not the honours of wisdom.
Discoursing on the variety of opinions that
are daily formed on the same conduct, La Luo
observed how much that which is commonly
called opinion is the result of passion and
temper*
- True, said .M. Vemueil, there is a tone
of thought, as there is a key note in music*
that leads all its weaker aiectioris. Thus,
where the powers of judging may be equal,
the disposition to judge is different 1 and the
actions of men are but too often arraigned
by whim and caprice, by partial vanity, and
the humour of the moment
Here La Luc took occasion to reprobate the
conduct of those writers, who, by snowing the
dark side only of human nature, and by dwel-
Mng'pn the evils only which are incident to hu«
inanity, have sought to degrade man in his own
eyes, and to make him discontented with life.
What should we say of a painter, continued
La Luc, who collected in his piece objects of
a black hue only, who presents you with
a black man, a black horse, «black dog, &&
&c, and tells you that his is a picture of na»
tore, and that nature is black ?—.'Tis. toe,
you would reply, the objects you exhibit do
exist in nature, but they form « very small
fart of her works. You say that nature is
lack, and, to prove it, you have collated
oil your canvass all the animals of this hae
that exist. But you have forgot to paint the
green earth, the blue skyf,the white man, and
objects of all those various hues with which
creation abounds, and of which black is a
verr inconsiderable parfc
^The countenance of M. Ferneuil lightened
with peculiar animation during the'discourse
of La Luc—To think well of his nature, mid
he, is necessary to the dignity and the happi*

THE ROMANCE OP THE' F0EBST.
 
 
beauties it exhibited, while la Luc, pleased
with the delight his friend expressed* sur-
veyed with more than usual satisfaction the
objects which had so often charmed him be-
fore. But there was a tender melancholy In
the tone of his voice and his countenance,
which arose from the recollection of haying
often traced those scenes, and partaken of the
pleasure they inspired, with her who had
long since hade them an eternal farewell.
They -presently quitted the lake, and,
winding up a steep ascent between the woods,
came after a hour's walk to a green summit,
which appeared, among the savags rocks that
environed it, like the blossom on the thorn.
It was a spot formed for solitary delight,
inspiring that soothing tenderness so dear to
the feeling mind, and which calls back to
memory the images of .past regret, softened
% distance and endeared by frequent recol-
lection. Wild shrubs grew from the crevices
of' the' rocks beneath, and the high trees of
pine and cedar that waved above, afforded ft
melancholy and romantic shades The silence
of the scene- was interrupted only by the
breeze as it rolled over the woods, and by the
solitary notes of the birds that inhabited the
cliffs.
'From this point the eye commanded ^ an
entire view of those majestic and sublime
Alps whose aspect fills the soul with emo-
tions of indescribable awe, and seems to lift
it to a nobler nature. The village and the
chateau of La Luc appeared in the bosoai of
the mountains, a peaceful retreat from the
storms' that gathered on their tops. All the
faculties of M. Verneuil were absorbed in
admiration, and he was for some time quite
silent; at length, bursting into a rhapsody,
he turned, and would hate addressed La Luc,
when he perceived' him at a distance leaning
against a' rustic urn, over which drooped in
beMtifiil luxuriance the weeping willow,
'As he approached, La Luc quitted his
fositfon, 'and advanced to meet him, while
f. Verneuil inquired upon what occasion
the urn' had been erected. La Luc, unable
to'answer, pointed to it, and walked silently
nway;' and M. Verneuil approaching the urn,
wad the following insetiptieri:

"'point of the eminence contemplating, the fed-
icape below with an air more placid, ""attd
touched with the sweetness''of. piety and ffw -
signation. He perccited that M.< Verneuil-
wag somewhat disconcerted^ and,he sought to
remove his uneasiness* You will consider it,
said he, as * mark of my esteem that 1 hate

faned by the presence of the unfeeling; they
would deride the faithfulness of an attach.
ment which-has so long survived its object,
and which, in their own breasts, would quickly
hate been lost amidst the diisipation of ge»
neral society. I have cherished in my heart
the remembrance of a woman whose virtues
claimed all my love: 1 have cherished it m
a treasure to which 1 could withdraw from
temporary cares and- vexations, in the cer-
tainty of finding a soothing, though melan-
choly comfort.
La Luc paused. M. Verneuil expressed
the sympathy he felt, but he'knew the sacred-
ness of'sorrow, and soon relapsed into silence.
One of the brightest hopes of a future state,
resumed La Luc, is, that we shall meet again
those whom we have loved upon earth. Aim!
perhaps our happiness may be permitted to
consist very much in the society of our friends,
putiied from the frailties of mortality, with
the finer affections more sweetly attuned, awl
with the faculties of mind infinitely more
elevated and enlarged. We shall _ then be'
enabled to comprehend subjects which are
too vast for human conception; to compre-
hend, perhaps, the sublimity of that Deity .
who Irst called us into being. These view*
of futurity, my friend, elevate us above the
evils of this world, and seem to communicate
to us a portion of the nature we contemplate*
Call them not the illusions of a visionary
brain, proceeded La Luc: 1 trust in their
reality. Of this I am certain, that whether
they are illusions or not, a faith in them
ought to be cherished for the comfort it brings
to the heart, and reverenced for the dignity it
imparts to the mind. Such feelings make a
happy and an important part of our belief in
a future existence: they give mmgf to virtue,
and stability to principle. 
This, said M. Verneuil, is what I .have
often felt, and what every ingenuous bum
must acknowledge.  '
La Luc and M. Verneuil continued in con*
venation till the sun had left-At scene. The
mountains, darkened by twilight* assumed^*
subliroer aspect, while the 'tops of aomt m
the highest Alps were yet illuminated by tiie
sun's rays, and formed a striking contrail to
the shadowy obscurity of the world below.
As they descended, through the wood***

and solemnity of the hour diffused * pB§»*

emboweved with eglantine and other sweet
shrubs, which hung m wild luxuriance around,
and formed n beautiful and simple decoration.
Clara and Adeline loved to pass their evenings
In this hall, where they had acquired the
first rudiments of astronomy, and from which
they • bad a wide view of the heavens. La
Luc pointed out to them the planets and the
fixed stam, explained their laws, and from
thence taking occasion to mingle moral with
sclentiIc instruction* would often ascend to*
wards that great First Cause, whose nature
soars beyond the grasp of human com pre-
hetutioft.
No study, lie would sometimes say, so
much enlarges the mind, or impresses it witli
ho sublime an idea of* the Deity, as that of
astronomy* When the imagination launches
into the regions of space, and contemplates
the innumerable worlds which are scattered
through it, we arc teat in astonishment and
awe. This globe appears as a mass of atoms
in the immensity of the universe, and man a
mere insect. Vet how wonderful! that man,
whose frame is so diminutive lit the scale of
being, should hare powers which spurn the
narrow boundaries of time and place, soar
beyond the sphere of his existence, penetrate
the secret laws of nature, and calculate their
pwgtts»if e effects.
<J! how expressively does this prove the
spirituality of our being I Let the materialist
consider it* and Mush that he has ever
doubted* •
In this hall the whole family now met at
supper; Mid during the remainder of the
evening the conversation turned upon general
subjects, in which Clara joined in modest and
judicious remark. 1m Luc had taught her to
ferailiarisc her mind to reasoning, and had
accustomed her to deliver he? sentiments
freely t she spoke them with a simplicity
extremely engaging, and which convinced her
heaters that the love of knowledge, not the
vanity of talking, induced her to converse.
M# Verneuil evidently endeavoured to draw
forth her sentiments 4 and Clara, interested
by the subjects he introduced, a stranger to
affectation* end pleased with the opinioni he
etpfegfed, answered them with frankness and
sintmatfen. Tliey retired mutually pleased
with-each ether*
- M. Vemeuil wis about slx-and-thirty; his
figure manly, fes countenance frank and en-
gaging. 'A quick penetrating eye, whose fire
•wag softened by benevolence, disclosed the
chi«£ traits, of hi* diameter; he was quick to
*tt*e*ni,.but s^nerouato excuse, the fellies of
mankind; aid while no one more sensibly
Alt-an injury, none mote readily accepted the
9***tisriM<.0f mi enemy*.
He was by birth a Frenchman* A fortune
lately devolved to him, had enabled him to
execute the plan which his active and inqui*
skive mind had suggcited, of viewing the
most remarkable parts of the continent. He-
was peculiarly susceptible, of the beautiful
and sublime in nature. To such a taste,
Switzerland and the adjacent country was,.of
aE others, the most interesting; and he found
the scenery it exhibited Infinitely surpassing
all that hi* glowing imagination had painted;
he saw with the eye of a painter, and felt
with the rapture of a poet*
In the habitation of La Luc he met with
the hospitality, the frankness, and the, sltn-
plicity so characteristic of the country; In his.
venerable host he iaw the strength of philo-
sophy united with the; Inert tenderness 'of
humanity—a philosophy which taught hint
to correct his feelings, not to annihilate them;
in Clara, the bloom of beauty with the most
perfect simplicity of heart; aril in Adeline*
all the chann* of elegance and grac% with a
genius deserving of the highest culture. In
this family picture the goodness of Madame
La Lac was not iwpereeived or forgotten*
The cheerfulness and harmony that reigned
within the chateau was delightful; hut the
philanthropy which, lowing from the heart
of the pastor, was diffused through the whole
village, and united the inhabitants in the
sweet and firm bonds of social compact,', was
divine* The beauty of its situation conspired
with these circumstances to male Lelpttcourf
seem almost a paradise. JUL Vemcuii sighed,
that he myst soon quit it. I ought to seek'
no further, said he, for here wimIoiw and hap^
pincss dwell together*
The admiration was reciprocal: La'. Irtic
and his family found themaelves much in-
terested in M. Vemeuil, and looked for^wd
to the time of his departure with regret, fto
warmly they pressed him to prolong his viiit,
and so powerfully his own inclination* se-
conded theirs, that he accepted the invitation*
La Luc admitted no circumstance which
might contribute to the amusement of his
guest, who having in a few days recovered
the use of his arm, they made several excur*
sions among the mountains. AcUdiue and
Clara, whom the care of Madame had restored
to her usual health, were generally of the
party.
After spending'a week at the chateau, M.
Vemeuil bade adieu to La Luc and hi* fe-
mily. They parted with mutual regret; and
the former promised that when he returned
to Geneva, he would tale Ltsloncourt in his
way. As he said this, Adeline, who ha^ for
some time observed with much' alarnV, La
Lac*» declining health, looked moumAtttjr'$i
hi« languid countenance, and utterjed is' 9€0h
prayer that he might live to receive th#'vlllf

THE ROMANCE OF Ttfff FOR&ST.
 
 
• Madame was the only person who did not
lament his departure l she saw that the efforts
of bet brother to entertain his guest were
Ik&nre than his 'present state of health would
aifeift of, and she rejoiced in the quiet that
'would now return to him.
But this quiet brought La Luc no respite
fironi illness; the fatigue he had suffered in
his late excursions seemed to have increased
his disorder, which In a short time assumed
the aspect of a consumption. Yielding to
the solicitations oi his family, he went to
Geneva for advice, and was there recom-
mended, to try the air of Nice.
The journey thither, however, was of con-
liderable length; and believing his life to he
very precarious, he hesitated whether to go.
lie,was also unwilling to leave the duty of
liw parish unperformed for so long a period
as his health might require; but this was an
objection which would not have withheld him
from .Nice, had his faith in the climate been
bqual to that of his physicians.
His parishioners felt the life of their pastor
to be of the utmost consequence to them: it
Was a general cause, and they testified at
once his worth, and their nev.se of it, by going
in a body to solicit him to leave them. He
was. much affected by this instance of their
attachment. Such a proof of regard, joined
with the entreaties of his own family, and a
consideration that for their sakes it was a
duty to endeavour to prolong his life, was too
powerful to be withstood, and he determined
to set out for Italy.
It was settled that Clara and Adeline,
whose health La Luc thought required change
of air and scene, should accompany him, at-
tended by the faithful Peter,
On the morning of his departure, a large
body of his parishioners assembled round trie
door to hid him farewell. It was an affecting

length, wiping the tears from his eyes, La
Luc. said, Ixit us trust in God, my friends;

body and mind. We shall meet again, If

There was scarcely a dry eye in the village;

1a Luc. He shook hands with them all;

Adeline being ready, they took a last leave'.
of'Madame La Luc, and quitted the chateau.
The ^'people unwilling to leave La'Luc, th,'e":
:|lfetef !j>art' of ^ them' accompanied' 'h'im to
^4Me 'distance from the village." ..As lie moved
••lowly'on, he cast a last lingering look'at his
little home, where he bad spent m many
peaceful years, and which he now gazed ©a
perhaps for the last time, and tears mm
to his eyes; but he checked them. Every
scene of the adjacent country called up,, as h$
passed, some tender remembrance. He looked
towards the spot consecrated to the memory
of his deceased wife; the dewy vapours of the
morning veiled it. La ,Luc felt the dittsp.
pointment more deeply, perhaps, than'reason
could justify; but those who Know from ex-
perience how<much the imagination loves to
dwell on any object, however remotely con-
nected with that of our tenderness, will (ml
with him. This was an object round which
the affections of La Luc had settled litem,
selves; it was a memorial to the eye, ami tli*i
view of it awakened more forcibly In the
memory every tender idea that could associate
with the primary subject of his regard In
such cases fancy gives to the illusions of strong
affection the , stamp of reality, and, they arc
cherished by the heart with romantic fondncsti,
His people accompanied'him for near a
mile from the village^ and could scarcely then
be prevailed on to leave him; at length -he
once more' bade them farewell, and went on
his way, followed by their prayers and hies*
sings.
I/a Luc ancl his little party travelled slowly
on, sunk in pensive silence—a silence too
pleasingly sad to be soon relinquished, and
which they indulged -without fear. of inter-
ruption. The solitary grandeur of the scenes
through which they passed, and the soothing
murmur of the pines that waved above, aided
this soft luxury of .meditation..
The? proceeded by easy stages; and aftet
travelling for some clays among the romaAtio
mountains and green valleys of Piedmont*
they entered the rich country of Nice* The
gay and luxuriant views which-now opened
upon the travellers as they wound .among the
hills, appeared like scenes of fairy enchant-
ment, or those produced by the lonely visions
of the poets. While the spiral summits of
the mountains exhibited . the snowy severity
of winter, the pine,, the cypress, the. olive, ana
the myrtle shaded their .sides with the green
tints of spring, and.graves of orange* lemon,
and citron, spread over their feet the, full gl©w
of autumn* As they advanced, the scenery
became still more diversified; and at length,
between the receding heights, Adeline caught
a glimpse #f the distant waters of the Medi-
terranean fading into the blue and cloudless
horizon. She bad' neves, .till now .seen the*

THE ROMANCE OF THE FOREST.
 
con&equ^nca of a certain dejection of mind
which w«de 'him reluctant to meet other
strangwi*'
the description 'which La Lac had given lt
of this foreigner had excited the curiosity of
Clara;,, and the Sympathy which the unfor-
tunate .ftel' ibt'each other ailed forth the
commiseration of Adeline; for that he was
unfortunate' she could 'not Jfbubt. On their
return' fifOni aft evening walk La Lite pointed
oat the chevalier, and quickened his pace to
overtake him. Adeline was for % moment
impelled to .follow; hut delicacy checked her
steps, she knew how painful the presence of
a stranger often is to a wounded mind, and
forbore to Intrude herself on his notice for
the sake of only satisfying an idle curiosity.
She turned therefore into another path j but
the delicacy which now prevented 'the meet- ,
ing, accident in a few days defeated, and La
Luc introduced the stranger. Adeline re-
ceived him with a soft smile, but endeavour*
ed to restrain the expression of pity which
her features had involuntarily assumed; she
wished him not-to know that she observed he
was unhappy.
After this interview he no longer rejected
the invitations of La Luc, but made him
frequent' visits, and often accompanied Ade-
line and Clara in their rambles. The mild
artd sensible conversation of the former seem-
ed to soothe his mind, and in her presence he
frequently conversed with a degree of anima-
tion which La Luc till then had not observed
in him. Adeline too derived from the si*
milarity of their taste, and his intelligent
cm creation, a degree of satisfaction which
contributed, with the compassion his dejec-
tion inspired, to win her confidence, and she
conversed with an easy frankness rather un-
usual to her.
Hi^ visits soon became more frequent He
walked with La Luc and his family; he
attended them on their little excursions to
view 'those magnificent remains of Roman
antiquity which enrich the neighbourhood of
Nice* when the ladies sat at home and
Worked, he enlivened the hours by reading to
them, and they had the pleasure to observe
his spirits somewhat relieved from the heavy
melancholy that had oppressed him.
M» Amand was passionately fond of music.
'Clara had not forgot to bring her beloved
lute: he would sometimes strike the chords
'In the most sweet and mournful symphonies,
but never could be prevailed on to play.
When Adeline' or Clara played, he' would sit
In' deep reverie, and lost to every object
around him, except when he fixed his eyes
in mournful gaze on Adeline, and a sigh
would' sometimes escape him,
'One evening, Adeline having excused her-
self from accompanying La Luc and Clam in
k visit'to' a- neighbouring 'family, she  retired
to the terrace of the garden which overlooked
the sea; and as she viewed the tranquil
splendour of the setting sun, and Ms glories
reflected on the polished surface of the wave*,
she touched the strings of the lute in softest
harmony, her voice accompanying it with
words which she had one day written after
having read that rich effusion of Shakspeare's
genius, "A Midsummer Night's Dream.**
TITAN!A TO HER LOVE.
01 fly with me through distant air
To Isles that gem the western deep 
For laughing Summer revels there,
And hangs her wreath on every steep.
At through the green transparent sea
Light floating on Its waves we go.
The nymphs shall gaily welcome me
Far in their coral cafes below.
For oft upon their margin sands,
When twilight leads the freshening hours,,
1 coine with all my jocund bands
To charm them from their sea-green hewers.
And well they love our sports to view.
And on the ocean's breast to lav« j
An«i oft as we the dance renew.
They call up music from the wave.
Swift hie we to that splendid clime.
Where gay Jamaica spreads her scene,
Lifts the blue mountain—wild—suhlime!
And smooths her vales of vivid green;
Where throned high in pomp of shade,
The power of vegetation reigns,
. Expanding wide, o'er hill and glade,
Shrubs of all growth—fruit of all stains:
She steals the sun-beams* fervid glow
To paint her flowers of mingling line;
And o'er the grape the purple throw.
Breaking from verdant leaves to view.
There, myrtle bowers, and citron grove,
0*er canopy our airy dance;
And there the sea-breeze loves to mw
When trembles day's departing glance.
And when the false moon steals away,
Or ere the chasing morn doth rise.
Oft, fearless, we our gambol* play
By the fire-worm's radiant eyes.
And suck the honey'd reeds that swell
In tufted plumes of silver white;
Or pieree the cocoafs milky cell.
To sip the nectar of delight I
And when the shaking thunders roll.
And lightnings strike athwart the gloom.
We shelter in the cedar's hole.
And revel 'mid the rich perfume.
But chief we love, beneath the palm.
Or verdant plantain's spreading leaf,
To hear, upon the midnight calm,
Sweet Philomela pour her grief.
To mortal sprite such dulcet sound,
Sudi blissful hours, were never known!
O! lly with me my airy round.
And I will make them all thine own t
Adeline ceased to sing—when she immedi-
ately heard repeated in a low voice,'
To mortal sprite such dulcet sound*
Such blissful hours, were never known!
and turning her eyes whence it came* gh*
saw ML Aniand. She Mushed and kid down

'v»«€§ of 'beautiful nature, that her mind

• imtlirmtion now become habitual to it, was
 soothed "and fortified. Of all the grand ob-

While to soft lutes the portals wide unfold,"

Pearls that in Neptune's briny waves they sought,
And gold from India's deepest cavern's brought

Near three weeks had now elapsed at Nice,
during which the disorder of I* Luc seemed
rather to increase than abate, when bis physi-
cian very honestly confessed the little hope lie
entertained from the climate, and advised him
to try the effect of a sea voyage, adding that
if the experiment failed, even the sir of
Montpellier appeared to him more likely to
afford relief than that of Nice. I a Luc re.
reived this disinterested advice with a mix-
ture of gratitude and disappointment. The
circumstances which had made him reluctant
to i|uit Savoy, rendered him yet more m
to protiact his absence and Increase his ex-
penses; hut the tics of affection that bound
him to Iil» family, and the love of life, which
m seldom leaves as, again prevailed over infe-
rior considerations; and he determined to coast
the Afcditerranean as far as Languedoc, where
if the voyage did not answer his expectation
lie would land and proceed to Montpcllier.
When M. Annum! learned thai Im l/ucde*
signed to quit Kite in a few day*, h* deter-
mined not to leave It before him. During
this iiiti'tviil he had not suittcietu resohition to
deny himself the fiwjuunt conversation..of
Adeline, though her presence, by mmmdkig
him of his Jest wife, gave him more pain tlmti
comfort* Uv was the seeofccl sou of a jfreach
gentleman of family, and had been tnarrfed
about a year to a lady to whom hu had long
been attached, when she died in hts* lying-in.
The tttfkit mmt followed its mother,, and
left the disconsolate father abandoned to
grief, which had preyed m he-uvily on hi*
health, that his physician thought it ncees*
lary to mul him to Nice. Vrmti the air of
Nice, however, he had derived no beneifil;
and lu* now determined to uavel further into
Italy, though he no longer fell any interest in
those cliarmitig scenes which in happier days
and with her whom he never ceased to lament,
would have afforded him the highest degree
of mental lu;iury~~now he sought only to
escape from himself, or rather fioin the image
of her who had once constituted his truest
happiness.
La Luc having laid his plan, hired a small
vessel, and in a few days embarked, with
a sick hope, bidding aiJieu to the shores of
Italy and the towering Alps, ami seeking on
a !nv element the health which had hitherto
mocked his pursuit.
JI. Amand took a melancholy leave of bis
new friends, whom he attended to the sea-
aide. When lie assisted Adeline on board,
his heart was too full to sutler hint to say
farewell; but lie stood long on the beach pur-
suing with his eye a her couise over the w»te?%
and waving bis hand, till tears dimmed his
sight. The breeze wafted the vessel gently
from the coast, and Adeline mm herseJf sur-
rounded by tite undulating wave* of the
ocean. The shore appeared to recede, its
mountains to lesM»n, the gay colour* c£ Its
landscape to melt into tach other, and In
a short time the Jigurc of M. Amand wwt

castle and haihour next faded away in dis-
tance, and the purple tint of the motintsrfiM
was at length all that remained on the mtge
of the horbon. ^ha. sighed as she gased, and
her eyes tilled with tears. So vanished twy

Towards evening the captain, to avoid the
danger of encountering a Barbary corsair
steered for the French coast, and Adeline dis-
tinguished in .the gleam of the setting sun the
„§bore» of Provence, feathered with wood and
green wjth pasturage* ha, JUtc, languid and

tended him. The pilot at 'the helm guiding
the tall vessel through the sounding waters,
and one solitary sailor leaning with crossed
arms against the mast* and now and then
tinging parts of a mournful ditty, were all
of :ihe crew, except Adeline, that remained
upon deck—and Adeline silently watched the
declining.sun,' which threw a saffron glow
upon'-'the 'waves and on the sails gently swel-
ling in the breeze that was now dying away.

and twilight stole over the scene, leaving the

wide around. She. sketched the picture, but

As the shadows thickened, the acene sunk
into deeper repose. Even the sailor's »ng
had ceaseds no sound' was heard but that
of the waters dashing beneath the vessel* and
their fainter murmur on :'the pebbly toast.
Adeline's mind was in unison with the tran.
quillitjr of the hour; lulled by the waves,
me resigned herself to a still melancholy and
sat lost in reverie. The present moment
brought to her recollection her voyage up the
Rhone, when seeking refuge from the terrors
of the Marquis de Montalt, she so anxiously
endeavoured to anticipate her future destiny.
She'then, as now, had watched the fall of eve-
ning and the fading prospect, and she remem-
bered what a desolate feeling had accom-
panied the impression which those objects
made. She had then no fricnds—aio asylum
~-ao certainty of escaping the pursuit of her
enemy. How she had found affectionate
friends—a. secure retreat—and was delivered
from the terrors she then suffered—hut still
she was unhappy. The remembrance of
Theodore—of Theodore who had loved her
so truly, who had encountered and suffered so
much for her sake, and of whose fate sic
was now as ignorant as when she traversed
the Ehone, was an incessant 'pang to her
heart.  She seemed to be more remote than
ever from the possibility of hearing, of him.
'Sometimes a faint hope 'crossed her that he
had escaped the malice of his .persecutor;
but when she considered the inveteracy and
power of the latter, and the heinous light in
which the law regards an assault upon a su-
perior officer, even this poor hope vanished,
and left her to tears and anguish, such as
this reverie,, which began with a'sensation of
only gentle melancholy, now 'led to. She
continued to muse til the moon arose from
the bosom of the ocean, and shed .her trem-
bling lustre npor* the waves, diffusing peace,
'and making silence more solemn; beaming a
soft light' on the white sails,  and throwing
upon the waters the tall shadow of the vessel
which now seemed to glide along unopposed
by any current Her tears had somewhat re-
lieved the anguish of her mind, and, she again
reposed in placid melancholy, when' a strain
of such tender and entrancing sweetness stele
on the silence of the hour, that it seemed
more' like celestial than mortal, music-^&o
aoft, 'so soothing, It sunk upon her ear, that
* It recalled her from misery to hope and love.
1 She wept again—but these'were tears which
she would not have exchanged for mirth and
joy.' She looked round, but perceived neither
ahip nor boat; and as the undulating *ound»

to tones of'the most languishing softness.

pressed by- a degree of disappointment which
the occasion did not appear to justify.
1a Lac grew better during the voyage, his
spirits revived, and when the vessel entered
that part of the Mediterranean called the Gulf
of Lyons, he wm sufficiently animated to en-
joy from tlie deck the noble prospect which

in the far distant ones of Languedoc, exhibitcu*
.Adeline and Clara, who anxiously watched his
looks, rejoiced in their amendment; and the
fond wishes of the latter already anticipated
Ma perfect recovery. The expectations of
Adeline bid been too often checked by disap-
pointment to permit her now to Indulge an
equal degree ox hope with that of her friend,
yet she collided much in the elect of this
voyage.
Im Luc amused himself at intervals with
discoursing, and pointing out the situations
of considerable ports on the coast, and the
months of the rivers that, after wandering
through Pretence, disembogue themselves
into the Mediterranean. The Bbone, how-
ever, was tlie only one of much consequence
which he ptAed* On this object, though it
wtS'S© distant that fancy perhaps, rather than
the sense, beheld it, Clara gated with pecu-
liar pleasure,, for It etme from the bants of
Savoy; and the wave which die thought she,
peweived, had washed the feet of her dear'
native mountains. The time passed with
mingled pleasure and improvement as La Luc
described to'his attentive pupils the maimers

the coast, and the natural history of the coun-
try j or as lie traced in imagination the remote
wanderings of rivers to their source, and de-
lineated the cliaractexifetic beautie* of their
scenery.
• After a pleasant voyage of a few days, the
shore* of Pfovence receded, snd that of hm*
g«?do€» which had long bounded the distance,
became the grand objtct of'the scene, .land the
sailors drew near their pott* Taey lauded. In

to be contented with* .  ,.
In the evening, the beauty of the hourond
the desire of exploring new scenes, invited
Adeline to walk. 1m Lac was fatigueuVLa«id

Adeline tool her way to the woods* that -nose
front the margin of the sea, and climbed she
wild eminence on which they hung. Often;<aa
sho went she turned her eyes to catch bctutoen
the dark foliage the blue waters of the bay,
the white sail that flitted by, and the tremb-
ling gleam of the Netting sun. When she
reached • the summit, and looked down over
the dark tops of the woods on the wide and
various prospect, the was seized with a kind
of still rapture impossible to be expressed,
and stood unconscious ©f the flight of time,
till the sun had left the scene, and twilight
threw its solemn shade upon the mountains*
The sea alone reflected the fading splendour
of the west; its tranquil surface was partially
disturbed by the low wind that crept In tre-
mulous lines along the waters, whence rising
to the woods, It shivered their light legves,
and died away, Adeline, resigning; herself to

The spreading dusk at length reminded
Adeline of her distance from the inn, and that
she 'had her way to find i through a wild and
lonely wood s she bade adieu to the syren that
had so long detained her, and pursued the
path with quick steps. Having followed it
fat some time, she became bewildered among
the thickets, and the increasing darkness did
not allow he? to judge of the direction she was
in. Her apprehensions heightened her,diffi-
culties: she thought she distinguished the
voices of men at some little distance, and she
increased her speed till she found herself on
the sea-sands mm which the woods impended*
Iter breath was now exhausted—she paused a
moment to recover herself* and fearfully lis-
tened t hut Instead of the Yokes of men, she
teafd faintly swelling in the breeze the notes
oi MOt^rttful music,.—Her heart, ever sensible
ty the Impressions of toelody, melted with the
totfe*? giid her, fears were for a moment lulled
ih" sweet encliantment* ' Surprise was soon
mingled with delight when, as the sound ad-
vanced, A* distipptished the tome of that in-
strument, and the melody of that well-known
air, she had heard a few preceding, evenings
ftom the shores of Provence, But she had no
time for coiijceture—footsteps approached, and*
she renewed her'speed.,. She was, nW emerged
from the darkness of'the woods, anil the moon,
which shone bright, exhibited along the level
sands the town and port in the distance* The
steps that had followed now came, up with
herf and she perceived two men;, hut they
passed in conversation without noticing her,
arid as they passed she was certain she recol-
lected the voice of him who was then speak-
ing. Its tones were so familiar to her ear,
that she was surprised at the imperfect me-
mory which did not suffer her to he assured bf
whom they were uttered. Another step now
followed, arid a rude voice called to her to stop.
As she hastily turned her eyes she saw im-
perfectly by tfie moonlight a man in sailor*g
habit pursuing, while he renewed the call
Impelled hy terror, she fled along the sands 1
hut her steps were short and trembling—4hose
of her pursuer strong and quick*
She had just strength sufficient to teach the
men who had before passed her, and to im»
plore their protection, when her pursuer came
up with them, but suddenly turned into tie
woods on the left, and disappeared*
She had no breath to answer the inquiries
of the strangers who supported her, till a sud-
den exclamation, and the sound of her ows
name, drew her eyes attentively upon the per-
son who uttered them, and in the rays wiicli
shone strong from his features she distinguished
M, Verneuil! Mutual satisfaction and ex.
planation ensued; and when he learned that
La Luc and'his daughter were at the inn, he
felt an increased pleasure in conducting her
thither. He said that he had accidentally met
with an old friend in Savoy, whom he now
introduced hy the pame of Mauron, and who
had prevailed on him to change his route .and
accompany him to the shores of the Mediter-
ranean. They had embarked from the coast
of Provence only a few preceding ,days, and
had that evening landed in Langwetloc, on the
estate of M. Maiiron. Adeline hail now mo
doubt that it was the flute of M. Verneuil,
and which had so often delighted her .at Le»
Ion court, that she had heard on the sea. -
When they reached the inn, they found i*
Luc, under great anxiety for Adeline^ in scare!
of whom he had sent several people. Anxiety
yielded to. surprise and pleasure, when he per-
ceived her with M. Verneuil, whose eyes
beamed with unusual animation on seeing

tike his guesta to the chateau, and departed
to give orders for their reception. The pre-
«stce of M. Vcrneuil, and the kindness of km
flciend, gave to La Luc an unusual flow of
spirits; he conversed with a degree of vigour
and liveliness to which he had long been
unaccustomed, anil the smile of satisfaction
that i Clara gave to Adeline* expressed how
much she thought lie wan already benefited by
the voyage* Adeline answered her look with
a smile of less confidence, for she attributed his
present animation to » more temporary cause.
About half an hour after the departure of
M« Manron, a boy who served as waiter
brought a message from a chevalier then tit
the "mnf requesting permission to speak with
Adeline. The man who had pursued her
along the sands instantly occurred to her, and
'§f« scarcely doubted that ttic stranger was

would have withdrawn, but La Luc begged
he would stay.
You are perhaps a relation of this young
lady, Sir, said he, and may have brought
news of'her father ?~~Not so, Sir, replied
Louis, hesitating — This gentleman, said
Adeline, who had now recollected her dissi-
pated thoughts, is the son of the M. La
Motto whom yon may have heard me men.
tion.~Ixmis seemed shocked to be declared
the; son of a man that had once acted so un-
wfithlly towards Adeline, who, instantly
per.ceiling the pain her words occasioned,
endeavoured to soften theix effect by saying
that La Motte had saved her from imminent
danger, -and had afforded her an asylum for
many months,—Adeline sat in a state of
itss^M,-.solicitude to know the particulars of
Theodore's situation, yet could not acquire
courage .to renew the subject in the presence
or4' Xi» Luc $ she ventured, however, to ask
Lf nif if his .own jegiment was qBartered in
thf:tewn, ,
'JEfc-.r*plied .that his, regiment lay «t Yaceanf
a Itei^i town pa the frontiers .of Spain; thai
lie Jh$A'' Just, cwroed a part of the Gulf of
Lyons, and was on his way to S*Y©y, whitae*
he should set out early Jn the morning.
We are lately come from thence, said
Adeline; may 1 ask to what part of Sato?
you are going ?—To Leloneourt, he replied.
—T© Leloncourt! said Adeline, In some
surprise—1 am a stranger to the country,
resumed Louis; but I go to serve my friend.
You seem to know Leloneourt,—! do indeed,
said Adeline-—You probably know then that
M. La Luc lives there, and will guess the
motive of my journey?
O HeaYens! is it possible ? exclaimed Ade.
line*~is it possible that Theodore Peyton is
a relation of M* La Luc?
Theodore I what of my son? asked La
Luc in surprise and apprehension—lroir
son I said Adeline, in » trembling vdice—
your son I—The astonishment and anguish
depicted on her countenance increased the ap-
prehensions of this unfortunate father, anil
tie renewed his -question. But Adeline was
totally unable to answet him.; • and the dis-
tress of Louis,-on thus unexpectedly dis-
covering the father of his unhappy friend,
and knowing that it was his task to disclose
the fate of his son, deprived, him for some
time of all power of utterance; and La Luc
and Clara, whose fears were .e^ery instant
heightened by this dreadful silence, con-
tinued to repeat their questions.
At length a sense of the approaching suf-
ferings q{ the good La Luc overcoming every
other feelings Adeline recovered strength of
mind sufficient to fry to soften the intelli-
gence Louis had to communicate, and to
conduct Clara to another room.  Here she
collected resolution to tell her, and with
much tender consideration, the circumstances
of her brother's situation, concealing only
her knowledge of his sentence being already
pronounced. This relation necessarily in-
eluded the mention of their attachment, and
in the friend of her heart Clara discovered
the innocent cause of her brother's destruc-
tion. Adeline also learned the occasion of
that circumstance which had contributed to
keep her ignorant of Theodore's relationship 
to la Luc; she was told the former had
taken the name of Peyton, with an- estate
which had been left him about a year before
by a relation of his mother's upon that con-
dition. Theodore had been designed for the
church, but his disposition inclined him to a
more active life than the clerical habit would
admit of; and on his accession to this estate he
had entered into the service of the French king.
In the few and interrupted Inter Yiews which
had been allowed them at Caux, Theodore
had mentioned his family to Adeline only in
general terms; and thus, when they were so
suddenly separated, had, without designing
it, left bet in ignorance of his fathers name
and'place of residence*
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The tacredntss mi delicacy of Adeline**
grief, which had never penult ted her to men-
tion thf subject of it #ven to Clara, had wince
contributed to deceive her.
Tlit d .ureas of Claia, on learning the
Mt tuition of her brother, could endure no re-
straint; Adeline, who bad commanded hex
feelings so m to impart this intelligence with
tolerable compohure, only by a strong effort
of mind, was now almost overwhelmed by
her own and dura'* accumulated suffering.
While they wept forth the anguish of their
heart i { a scene if possible, more affecting
passed between La Luc and Louis ; who per-
ceived it was necessary to inform him,
though cautiously and by degrees, of the fall
extent of hi* calamity, lie, t'nerefore, told La
Lite, that though Theodore had been first
tried for the offence of having quitted hi*
post, he was now condemned on a charge of
assault made upon his general officer the
Marquis de Montalt, who had brought wit.
ncsses to prove that his life had been, endan-
gered by the circumstance ; and who, having
pursued the prosecution with the mini bitter
rancour, had at length obtained the sentence
which the law could not withhold, but which
every other officer in the regiment deplored.
Ijoui» added, that the sentence was to be
executed in less than a fortnight, and that
The<xlore being very unhappy At receiving no
answers to the letters he bad sent his father,
wishing to see him once more, and knowing
that there was now no time to be lost, had
requested him to go to Lcloncourt ami ac-
quaint lib father with life situation.
l#a Luc received the account of his son's*
condition with a distress that admitted neither
iif tears nor complaint* He mkei where
Theodore waa; and desiring to be conducted
to him, he thanked Louis for all his kind*
ness, and ordered post horses immediately.
A carriage was soon ready; and this un-
happy father, after taking a mournful leave
of jVI. Verneuil, and sending ft compliment
to M. Mauxon, attended by' his family set
out for the prison of his son. The journey
was a silent one; each individual of the party
endeavoured, in consideration of each other,
to suppress the expression of grief, bat wai
unable to do more. La Luc appeared calm
and complacent; lie seemed frequently to be
engaged in prayer; but a struggle for resig-
nation and composure waa sometimes visible

We now return to the Marquis d# Montalt,
»ho having seen 1m Motta safely lodged in
the prison of D— ,, „
trial wtmld not cotne on immediawy, had
returned to his villa on the bowlers of the
forest, where he ci peeled to hear news of
Adeline, It bad been'his intention to f©Mow
his servants to Lyons; but he new detemufU
ed to wait a few days for letters, and he had
little doubt that Adeline, since her flight bud
been so quickly pursued, would be overtaken,
and probably before she could reach that
city. In ibis expectation he hid been mine*
rably disappointed; for his servants informed
him, that though they traced her thither*
they had neither been able to follow hex
route beyond, rtor to discover her at Lyon*.
This escape she probably owed to hating
embarked on the Khone, for it dots not »p-
|H*ar that the Marquis's people thought of 4
seeking her on the course of that r«vt r.
His presence was soon after r(.quired at
Vaceau, where the court-martial was then
sitting; thither therefore he went, with pas-
sions still more exasperated by his late dift»
appointment, and procured the condemnation
of Theodore. The sentence wm universally
lamented, for Theodore was much beloved
in his regiment; arid the occasion of the.
Marquis's personal resentment towards him
being known, every heart was interested in
bin cause* t ''
Louis de La Motte happening at this, time
to lie stationed in the same town, heard, an
imperfect account of his story; and being
convinced that the prisoner wm the young
chevalier whom he had formerly seen with the
Marquis at the nbbcy, he was induced partly
from compassion, and partly with a hope of
hearing of his parents, to visit him.^ The
compassionate sympathy which ixmi* ex*
pressed, and the zeal with which he tendered
liia services, affected Theodore, and excited
in him a warm return of friendship; Jxtuis
made him frequent visits, did every thing
that kindness could suggest to alleviate his",
sufferings, and a mutual esteem and confi-
dence ensued.
Theodore at length communicated the chief'
subject of his concern to Louis; who dis-
covered with Inexpressible grief that it wm
Adeline whom the Marquis had thus cruelly
persecuted, and Adeline for whose sake the
generous Theodore was about to suffer, lie _
soon perceived also that Theodore was his
favoured rival ? bat he generously suppressed:
the jealous pang this discovery occasioned,'
and determined thai bo prejudice of pasatott
should withdraw him from the duties of hu*
inanity and friendship* He eagerly inqulrM}'
where Adelitte then resided. She Is yet, I'/
fear, in the power of the Marquis, said1'
Theodore, sighing deeply. O Clod I—4ltffe'"

he would go to' the Marquis, and immedi-
ately quitted the prison. The Marquis, was,
fc»«r«w, already net off for Paris,' where tie
had hem gummontd to appear at the ap-
pnMMhing trldl of La Moite; and Louis, yet
fgoamtit of the late transactions at the abbey,
tetwiajd to the prison; where he endeavoured
t» forget that Theodore was the favoured
rival of his low, and to remember him only
m the defender of Adeline. Bo earnestly lie
f tented Ms offers #f service, that Theoaoi e,
whom  the silence of his father equally sur-
prised and afflicted, and who was vcry anxi.
<ras to see him once again, accepted his
proposal of going himself to Savoy. My
fetters i strongly suspect to have been inter-
cepted by the Marquis, said Theodore; if
to, my poor father will have the whole
weight of this calamity to sustain at once,
unless I avail myself of your- kindness, and
1 shall neither see him nor hear from him
before I die. Louis! there are moments
.when my fortitude shrinks from the conflict,
»nd my senses threaten to desert me.
No time was to bs lost; the warrant for
his execution had already received the king's
signature, and Louis immediately set for-
Wafd for Savoy. The letters of Theodore
had indeed been intercepted by order of the
Marquis, who, in the hope of discovering
the asylum of Adeline, had opened and
afterwards destroyed them.
But to return i& La Luc, who now drew
near Vaceau, and whom his family observed
to he greatly changed in his looks since he
had heard the late calamitous intelligence;
he uttered no complaint; but it was too
obvious that his'disorder had made a rapid
progress. Louis, who during the journey
proved the goodness of his disposition by the
-delicate attentions he paid this unhappy party,
concealed his observation of the decline of
La Luc, and to support Adeline's spirits,
endeavoured to convince her that her appre-
'hensions on this 'subject were groundless.
Her spirits did indeed require support, for
"she was now within a few miles of the town
'that contained Theodore; and while her in-
creasing perturbation almost overcame her,
the yet tried to appear composed. When
the carriage entered the town, she cast a
timid and anxious glance from the window
in search of the prison; but having passed
through several streets without perceiving
any building which corresponded with her
Idea of that she looked for, the coach stop-
 ped at the inn, The frequent changes in La
Luc's countenance betrayed the violent agi-
tation of his mind; and when he attempted
to aligjht, feeble and exhausted, he was com-
pelted to accept the support of Louis, to
whom he faintly said as he passed to the
.' pwlour, 1" am indeed sick at heart, hut 1
trust the pain will mt be long. Louis
pressed his hand without ipeaktog, And
hastened hack for Adeline and Clara, who
were already in the passage. La Luc wiped
the tears from his eyes (they were the first he
hail shed) as they entered the room, f would
go immediately to my poor boy, said he to
Louis; yours, Sir, is a mournful office—.he
so good as to conduct me to him. He rose
to go, but, feeble and overcome with gr'u-f,
again sat down. Adeline and Clara united
in entreating that he would compose himself,
and take some refreshment; and Louis urging
the necessity of preparing Theodore for the
interview, prevailed with him to delay it till
his son should be informed of his arrival,
and immediately quitted the inn for the
frison of his friend. When he was gone, L«
juc, as a duty he owed those he loved, tried
to take some support; hut the convulsions
of his throat would not suffer him to swallow
the wine he held to his parched lips, and he
was now so much disordered, that he desin d
to retire to his chamber, where alone, and hi
prayer, he passed the dreadful interval of
Louis's absence.
Clara on the bosom of Adeline, who vn
in calm but deep distress, yielded to tlie
violence of her grief, 1 shall lose my <!e:tr
father too, said she; 1 see it; 1 Khali h^>-
my father and my brother together. Adelire
wept with her friend for some time hi sileniv;
and then attempted to persuade her that I .a
Luc was not so ill as she apprehended,
Do not mislead me with hope, she replied
that will not survive the shock of this ca-
lamity—-! saw it from the first. Adeline
knowing that La Luc's distress would he
heightened by the observance of his ^daugh-
ter's, and that Indulgence would only increase
its poignancy, endeavoured to rouse her to
an exertion of fortitude by urging the neces-
sity of commanding her emotion in the pre-
sence of her father. This is possible, added
she, however painful may be the effort.
You must know, my clear, that my grief U
not inferior to your own, yet I have hitherto
been enabled to support my sufferings m
silence; for M. La Luc I do, indeed, love
and reverence as a parent,
Louis meanwhile reached the prison <»
 Theodore, who received him with an air of
mingled surprise and impatience. W ^!;l{
'brings you back so soon? said he, have yo«
heard news of my father? Louis now gradu-
ally unfolded the circumstances of _ their
meeting, and La Luc's arrival at Vaceau.
A various emotion agitated the countenance
of Theodore oil receiving this intelligence.
My poor father 1 said he, he has then iol-
< lowed his son to this ignominious place .
Little did I think when last we parted he
would meet me in a prison under condemna-
tion! This reflection roused an impetuosity
of grief which deprived him for some time vi
 
120
speech? But whore Is he? said Theodore,
recovering himself; now lie Is come f shrink
from the interview I have no much wished
fm. The sight of his distress will he dread-
ful to me. liOui*! when I am gone, comfort
my poor father, His voice was again Inter*.
rupted by sobs; and Louis, who had been
fearful of acquainting him at the same time
of the arrival of La Lue anil die discovery of
Adeline, now judged it proper to administer
the cordial of tM» latter intelligence.
The glooms of a prison and of calamity
vanished for a transient moment; those who
had seen Theodore would have believed this
to he the instant which gave him life and
liberty. When his first emotions subsided,
1 will not repine, said he, since i know that
Adeline is preserved, and that 1 shall once
more see my father, 1 will endeavour to die
with resignation, lie inquired if La Luc
was then in the prison, and was told lie was
at the inn with Clara and Adeline, Adeline!
Is Adeline there too ?—This Is beyond my
hopes. Yet why do I rejoice? I must never
see ljiT more; this is no place for Adeline.
Again lie relapsed into an agony of distress—.
and again repeated a thousand questions con-
cerning Adeline, till he was reminded by
Louis thai his father was impatient to sec
him—when, shocked that he had so long de-
tained his friend, he entreated him to conduct
La Luc to the prison, and endeavoured to
re-collect fortitude for the approaching inter-
view.
When Ixmis returned to the inn, La Luc
was still in his chamber; and Clara quitting
the room to call him, Adeline seized with
trembling impatience the opportunity to in-
quire more particularly concerning Theodore,
than she chose to do in the presence of It is
unhappy sister, lionis represented him to
he much mor.: tranquil than he really wp$,
Adeline was somewhat soothed by the ac-
count; and her tears, hitherto restrained,
flowed silently and fast till La Luc appeared.
If is countenance had recovered its serenity,
hut was impressed with a deep and steady
sorrow, which excited in the beholder a min-
gled emotion of pity and reverence. How is
my son, Sir? said he an he entered the room.
M e will go to him immediately.
Clara renewed the entreaties that had been
already rejected, to accompany her father,
who persisted in a refusal. To-morrow you
shall see him, added he; but our first meet-
ing must be alone. Stay with your friend,
my dear; she has need of consolation. When'
La Luc was gone, Adeline, unable longer to
struggle against the force of grief, retired to
her chamber and her bed.
La Luc walked silently towards the prison,
resting on the urm of ixmis. It was now
night: a dim lamp that hong above showed
them the gates, and Ixum rang a hell: La
K
Luc, almost overcome with agitation, leaned
against the postern till ihe; porter appealed.
He inquired for Theodore, and followed-the
man; but when he yeachea 'the second court.
yard he seemed ready to feint* aid again
stopped, Lou Is desired the porter would
fetch some water f but I/a Luc, reeovarina
his voico, said he should noon be better, .ana
would not miller htm to go. In svfew mi-
nutes he was able to follow Louis, who led
him through several dark passages, »nd tip a
flight of steps to a door Which, being jm-
barred, disclosed to him the prison of histon.
He was seated at a small table, on which
stemd a lamp that threw a feeble lipht mtom
the place, sufficient only* to show its desola-
tion and wretchedness. When he perceived
La Luc he sprung from his chair, and in the
next moment was in his arms. My father I
said he in a tremulous voice. My »on! ex-
claimed 1a Luc; and they were for some
time silent, and locked in each other's em-
brace. At length Theodore led him to the
only chair the room afforded, and seating
himself with Ixmis at the foot of the bed,
had leisure to observe the ravages which ill—
nt'ss and calamity had made on the features
of his parent. La Luc made several efforts
to speak; but, unable to articulate, laid his
hand upon his breast and sighed doeply.
Fearful of the consequence of so affecting a
scene on his shattered frame, Iiouift endea-
voured to call off his attention from the im.
mediate object of his distress, and interrupted
the silence; but La Luc shuddering, and
complaining he was very cold,  sunk back in
his chair. His condition roused Theodore
from the stupor of despair ; and while he Hew
to support his father, Louis ran out for other
assistance^—I shall soon be better, Theodore,
said Iia Luc, unclosing his eyes, the feint*
ncss is already going off. I nave not been
well of late; and this sad meeting f-^-Unable
any longer to command himself, Theodore
wrung his hand, and the distress which had
long struggled for utterance burst in convul-
sive throbs from his breast. La l*oc gradu-
ally revived, and exerted himself to calm the
transports of his son; but the fortitude of the
latter had now entirely forsaken him, and he
could only utter exclamation and complaint*
Ah! little did I think we should ever, meet
under circumstances so dreadful as the pre-
sent I But I have not deserved them, my
father! the motives of my conduct have still
been just
That is rny supreme consolation, said La
Luc, and ought to support you fa this hour
of trial. The Almighty God, who is the
judge of hearts, will reward you hereafter.
Trust in him, my ion; I look to him with
no feeble hope, but with a firm reliance on

of meek devotion, while the tears of humanity
fell slowly on his cheek.
Still more affected by his last words, The©.
dare turned from him, Mid paced the room
with quick steps the entrance of Louis was
a very seasonable relief to' 1a Luc, who,
taking"a cordial he had brought, was soon
sufficiently restored to discourse on the sub-
ject most iatcrestteg to him. Theodore tried
to attain a command of his feelings, and sue*
ceeded. He conversed with tolerable compo-
sure fot above an hour, during which I a Luc
endeavoured to elevate,-by religious hope, the
mind of his son, and to- enable him to meet
with fortitude the awful hour that approached.
But the appearance of resignation which
Theodore attained always vanished when he
reflected that he was going to ieaYe his father
a prey to grief, and his beloved Adeline for
ewer. When La Luc was about to depart he
again mentioned her. Afflicting is an inter-
view must be In our present circumstances,
•aid he, I cannot bear the thought of quitting
the world'without seeing her once more; yet
1 know not ho# to ask her to encounter, for
nny sake, the misery of a parting scene. Tell
her that my thoughts never, for a moment,
leave her; that — La Luc interrupted, and
assured him, that since he m much wished it,
he should see her, though a meeting could
serve only to heighten the mutual anguish of
a final separation.
I know it—.1 know it too well, said Theo-
dore | yet I cannot resolve to see her no more,
and, thus spare her the pain this interview
must inflict. O my father! when 1 think of
those whom I must soon leave for ever, my
heart breaks. But I will, indeed, try to pro-
tit by your precept and example, and show
that your paternal care has not been in vain.
JVIy good Louis, go with my father—he has
need of support. How much I owe this
generous friend, added Theodore, you well
know, Sir.—1 do, in truth, replied La Luc,
and can never rlpay his kindness to you. He
has contributed to support us all; but yon
require comfort more tnan myself—he shall
remain with you.—I will go alone.
This Theodore would not softer; and La
Luc bo longer opposing him, they affection-
ately embraced, and separated for the night.
When they reached the inn, La Luc con-
sulted with Jbouis on the possibility of ad-
dressing a petition to the sovereign time
enough to save Theodore. His distance from
Paris, and the short interval before the pe-
riod fixed for the execution of the sentence,
made this design difficult: but believing it
was practicable, La Luc, incapable as he ap-
peared . of performing so long a Journey, de-
termined to attempt it. Louis, thinking that
ilie, undertaking would prove fatal to the
father, without benefiting the son, eadea-
voyred, tbough faintly, to dissuade him from
it—but his resolution waft fixed.—If 1 sacrt.
fice the small remain* of my life in the ser-
vice of my child, taid he,: 1 shall lose little;
•if.. I iave him, I shaU' giua *my thing.
There is no time to be lost—1 will set off
immediately.
He would have ordered post-horses, but
Louis and Clara, who were now come from
the-bed-side of her Mend, urged the neces-
sity of his taking a few hours* repose: lie
was at length compelled to acknowledge him-
self unequal to the immediate exertion which
parental anxiety prompted, and consented to
seek rest.
When he had retired to his chamber, Clara
lamented the condition of her fother.-~.lle
will not bear the journey, said she; he is
greatly changed within these few days.-—Loui*
was so entirely of her opinion, that he could
not disguise it, even to flatter her with a
hope. She added, what did not contribute
to raise his spirits, that Adeline was so much
indisposed by her grief for the situation of
Theodore ana the sufferings of La Luc. that
she dreaded the consequence.
It has been seen that the passion of young
La Motte had suffered no abatement from
time or absence; on the contrary, the perse-
cution and the dangers which had pursued
Adeline awakened all his tenderness, and
drew her nearer to his heart* When lie had
discovered that Theodore loved her, and was
beloved again, he experienced all the anguish
of jealousy and disappointment; for, though
she had forbidden him to hope, he found it
too painful an effort to obey her, and hid
secretly cherished the flame which he ought
to have stiied. His heart was, however, too
noble to suffer his zeal for Theodore to abate
because he was his favoured rival, and his
mind too strong not to conceal the anguish
this certainty occasioned. The attachment
which Theodore had testified towards Ade-
line even endeared him to Louis, when lie
had recovered from the first shock of disap-
pointment, and that conquest over jealousy
which originated in principle, and was pur-
sued with difficulty, became afterwards his
pride and his glory. When, however, he
again saw Adeline—saw her in the" mild dig-
nity of sorrow more interesting than ever—
saw her, though sinking beneath its pressure,
yet tender and solicitous to soften the afflic-
tions of those around her—it wan with the
utmost difficulty he preserved his resolution,
and forebore to express the sentiments she
inspired. When he further considered that
her acute sufferings arose from the strength
of her affection, he more than ever wished
himself the object of a heart capable of so
tender a regard—and Thedore in prison and
in chains was a momentary object of envy*
In the morning, when La Luc arose from
short and disturbed slumbers, he found Louis,

immediately retired to her chamber, wh.irh
she was ton ill to quit that dav. In the even-

Louis, went to visit her brother, whxne emo-
tions, on hearing of his father's; departure,

quis, who staggered and fell senseless to the
ground, La Motte had time to teat from his
coat a brilliant star, some diamond rings from
his fingers, and to rifle his pockets before
his attendants came tip. Instead of pursuing
the robber, they all, in their first confusion,
lew jto assist their Lord, and Ira Motte
escaped.,,
lie stopped before  he reached the abbey at
a little ruin, the tomb formerly mentioned, to
examine his hooiy, Jt consisted of a puree
containing'seventy lou is d'ors; of a diawond
star, three rings' of great value, and a minia-
ture set with brilliants of the Marquis himself,
which, Ke. had intended as a present for his
favourite^ mistress. To La Motte, who but a
few hours before had seen himself nearly des-
titute, the view of this treasure excited an al-
most ungovernable transport; but it was toon
checked wnen'-he ^rancmbcrctf the means he
had employed to obtain it, and that he had _
paid for the wealth he contemplated, the price
of blood. JNaturally violent in his passions,
this reflection sunk him from the summit of
exultation to the abyss of despondency. He
considered himself a murderer, and, startled
as one awakened from a dream, would have
given half the world, had it been his, to have
 been' as poor, and comparatively as guiltless,
as a few preceding hours had seen him. On
examining the portrait he discovered the re.
semblance; and believing that his hand had
deprived the original of life, he gazed, upon
the picture with unutterable anguish. To the
horrors of. remorse succeeded the perplexites
of feat. Apprehensive of he knew not what,
he lingered, at the tomb, where he at length
deposited his treasure,'believing that if his
'offence should awaken justice, the abbey might
he searched, and these jewels betray him*
From Madame La Motte it was easy to con-
ceal his increase of wealth; for as'he had never
made her acquainted, with the texact state of
his finances, she had not suspected the extreme
poverty which menaced him; and as they
continued to live' as usual, she believed that
their expenses were drawn from the usual
supply. But "it was not so easy to disguise
 the'workings of remorse and horror: his man-
ner became gloomy and reserved, and his fre-
quent visits to the tomb, where he went partly
to examine his treasure, but chiefly to indulge
"in 'the dreadful pleasure of contemplating the
phjtbre of the Maquis, excited cariosity, la
''the- solitude of the forest, where no variety of
;'objects1 -occurred to renovate his ideas, the
horrible one of having committed murder was
,riter "present to' liini.—When' the Marquis **•
rived at the abbey, the astonishment mm!
terror of La Motte (for at first lie scarce knew
whether he held the shadow or the substance
of a human form) were quickly succeeded by
apprehension of the punishment due to' thV
crime he had really committed. When hi*
distress had prevailed on1 the Marquis to re-
tire, he informed him that he was by birth a
chevaliers he, ftai touched upon such parts
of his misfortunes as he thought would excite
pity, expressed.Siieh abhorrence of his guilt,
'ana voluntarily uttered such a solemn promise
of returning the jewels'he had yet in his pos-
session, (for he nad ventured to dispose only
of a small port,) that tlje Marquis at. length
listened to him wltji some., degree of compas-
sion. This favourable' sentiment, seconded
by a selfish motive, induced 'the Marquis to
compromise with La Motte. Of quick an*I
Inflammable passions, he 'had observed die
beauty of Adeline with an eye of no'common
regard, and he resolved to spare the life of La
Motte upon no other condition than the wt-
crifiee of. this unfortunate girl. La Motto h««u I
neither resolution nor- virtue sufficient to re-
ject the'terms—the jewels were "restored, awl
lie consented to betray" the innocent AcUii.e.
But as lie was too well acquainted with hc-r
heart to believe that she would easily be won
to the practice of vice, and as he still felt a
degree of pity and tenderness for her, he en-
deavoured to prevail on the Marquis to for-
bear precipitate measures, and to attempt
gradually to undermine her principles by se-
ducing her affections. He approved and
adopted this plan: the failure of his first
scheme induced him to employ the stratagems
he afterwards pursued, and thus to multiply
the misfortunes of Adeline.
Such were the circumstances which had
brought La Motte to his present deplorable
situation. The day of trial was now come,
and he was led from prison into the court,
where the Marquis' appeared as his accuser.
When the charge was delivered, La Motte,
as is usual, pleaded Not guilty, and the Ad-
vocate Nemours, who had undertaken to plead
for him, afterwards endeavoured to make it
appear that the accusation^ on the part of the
Marquis de Montalt, was false and malicious.
To this purpose he mentioned the circum-
stance of the latter having attempted to peT-
suade his client to the murder of Adeline : he
further urged that the Marquis had lived in
habits of intimacy with La Motte for several
months immediately preceding his arrest, and
that it was not till he had disappointed the
designs of his accuser, by conveying beyond
his reach theunhappy object of his vengeance,
that the Marquis had thought proper to charge
La Motte with the crime for which he stood
indicted* Nemours urged the improbability
of one man's keeping up a friendly iMetmntm

Adeline, lit* could not justify it hut by ex-

He, therefore, contented himself with produ-

a-e*«iuU and robbery, who swore without scru-
ple to the person of La Motte, though not

thnnigh the gWtii of evening and riding oft'

deiav wan of course rejected; but as the Mar-
quis bad yet two other witnesses to produce,
v.jio^- arrival at Paris bad been hourly ex-
pected, the event of tlie trial wah postponed,
arid the court adjourned.
La Mottc was re-conducted to bis prison
under Ifu; saint* pressure of despondency with
which he had quitted it. As he walked
through one of the avenues he. passed a man
why stout by to let him proceed, and who re-
tarded him with a f scd and earnest eye, La
Motte thought he hat! seen him before;, but
the imperfect view he caught of bis features
through the darkness of the place made him
uncertain as to litis, and his mind was in too
perturWd a Mate to suficr him to feel an in-
terest on the Mibjeet, M'heu lie was gone,
the stranger inquired of the keeper of the
prison who La Motte was: on being told,
and receiving answers to same further que*,
tionh lit put, he desired he might be admit-
ted to speak with hhn. The requewt, as the
man wa* only a debtor, was granttd; but as
the door* v;i;u« now shut for'tin: night, the
interview v,m deferred till the mmmw.
La Mo*te found Madame in his room*
where she had been waiting for .spine hours
to hear the event of the trial. They now
wished more earnestly than ever to see their
aon; but they were, as lie had suspected,
ignorant of hi* change of quartern, owing to
flic letters which he had as usual, addressed
to them under an assumed name, remaining
at the post-house of Auboinic. This circum-
Mance occasioned Madame La Motte to ad-
dress her letters to the place of her son** late
residence, and he had thus continued ignorant
, of his father*» misfortune* and removal* Ma-
dame La Motte, surprised at receiving no
, answer* to her letters* sent off another, con-
, tdiit.fog an account of the trial as far aa it had
jwexveded, and :i r'./qtu si that In I" .*.on wattM
obtain leuvc of absence, and set out for fails
instantly, As, the Wis still ignorant, of jhe
failure of her letters, awl, hail it been other-
wise, would not have known whither to liave
sent them, tdie directed this as usual*
Meanwhile his approaching fate was never
absent for a moment from the mind of La
Motte, which, feeble by nature, and still more
cnervaud by habits of indulgence, refused. $o
support him at this dreadful period*
While these scenes were parsing at Parts!,
La Luc arrived there without any accident,
after performing a journey, during which he
had been supported almost entirely by the
spirit of Ms resolution, lie hastened to throw
himself at the feel of the sovereign ; and M*ch
was the excess of his feeling on presenting tlie
petition which was to decide the fttte of hi*
*on, that he could only look silently up, and
then fainted. The king received the paper,
and giving orders for the unhappy fattier to
be taken care of, passed on. He was carried
back to Ida hotel, where he awaited the event
of this bin final effort
Adeline, meanwhile, continued at Vaceau
in a state of anxiety too powerful for Iter loug-
agitnted frame, and the tilings in consequence
of thi*, conlincd her almost wholly to her
chamber. Sometimes she ventured to flatter
herself with a hope that the journey of ,1<&
Jaic would fie successful; but these short and
illusive interval* of comfort served only to
heighten, by contrast, the despondency that
succeeded; and in the alternate extreme* of
feeling she experienced a state more torturing
than that produced either by the sharp stjng
of unexpected calamity, or the sullen paiooJf
settled despair*
When she was well enough she cainc clown
to the parlour to converse with Louis, who
brought her frequent accounts of Theodore,
and who passed, every moment he could, snatch
front the duty of hit* profession in endeavours
to support and console his afflicted friead*.
Adeline and Theodore, both looked to liitn for
the little comfort allotted them, for he brought
them intelligence of each other, and whenever
he appeared a transit?!! melancholy kind,of
pleasure played round their hearts, lie could
not conceal from Theodore Adeline** incliM*
position, since it was necessary to account for
ner riot indulging the earnest wish he repeat-
edly cxprctwicd to see her ;«gain. To Adeline
he spoke chiefly of the fortitude and resigna-
tion of his friend, not however forgctluHg to
mention the tender affection he coost'tfitly ex-
pressed for her. Accustomed to derive her

which bound him to life sufficiently to meet

rnight, arid' often attained "in the presence of
his friends' a manly composure. From the
event of his father's journey he hoped,little,
jet that little was sufficient to' keep his mind
in the torture of suspense till the issue should
appear. i'
On .the day preceding that fixed for the
execution of the sentence, La Luc reached
Vaceau. Adeline was at her chamber window
when the carriage drew up to the inn; she
saw Mm alight, and with feeble steps, sup-
ported by Peter, enter the house, ironi the
languor of his air she drew no favourable
omen, and, almost sinking under the violence
of her emotion, she went to meet him. Clara
was alteady' With her father when Adeline
entered the room. She approached him, but,
dreading to receive from his lips a confirmation
of the misfortune his countenance seemed to
indicate, she looked expressively at him and
tat doyrn, unable to speak the question she
would ha?e asked, lie held out his hand to
her In silence, sunk back in his chair, and
seemed to be fainting under oppression of
heart "His manner confirmed all her fears;
at this dreadful conviction her senses failed
her, and she sat motionless and stupefied.
La Luc and Clara were too much occupied
by their oWn distress to observe her situation;
after jiome' time she breathed a heavy sigh,
and burst into tears. Relieved by weeping,
her spirits gradually returned, and she at
length said to La Luc, It is unnecessary, Sir,
to ast. the success of your Journey; yet, when
you can bear to mention the subject, 1 wish-
La Luc waved his hand—Alas! said he, 1
have nothing to tell but what you already
guess too well. My poor' Theodore !—His
voice 'was i convulsed with sorrow, and some
moments of unutterable anguish followed.
Adeline WW the first who recovered suffi-
cient recollection to notice the extreme languor
of La Luc, and attend to his support* She
ordered him refreshments, and entreated he
would, retire to his bed and suffer her to send
for a' physician; adding, that the fatigue he
had suffered made repose absolutely necessary.
Woitld that' I' could find it; my dear child I
said he; it is not in this world that 1 must
look'for it, but in a better, and that better, I
trust, t shall soon attain. But where is our
good friend, Louis La Motte? He must lead
me to f tny son,—Grief again _ interrupted his
utterance, and the entrance of Louis was a
very seasonable 'relief to them all. Their
tears; explained the question he would have
asketL'' La Lufe immediately inquired for bis
tm r .and'trianklrig Louis for all his kindness
to hfm,: ,dcsired to be conducted to the'prison.
Louis endeavoured to persuade him to- defer
hit* visit till the morning, and Adeline and
Clara joined their entreaties with hte, but La
Luc determined to go that ntght»-~His time
is short, said he; a few hours and I 'shall ice
him no more, at least in this world ;:let me
not neglect the#e precious moments* Adeline!
,1 had promised my poor boy that he should
see you once more; you are not now equal to
the meeting; 1 will try to reconcile him to
the disappointment s but if I fail, and you
are better in the morning, 1 know you will
exert yourself to sustain the interview,—Ade-
line looked impatient, and attempted to speak.
La Luc rose to depart, but could only reach
the door of the room, where, faint and feeble,
he sat down in a chair. I must submit to neces-
sity, said he ; I find i am not able to go fur-
ther to-night, do to him, La Motte, and tell
him 1 am somewhat disordered by my journey,
but that I will be with him early in the
morning. Bo not flatter him with a hope;
prepare him for the worst.—.There was a pause
.of silence. La Luc at length recovering him-
self, desired Clara would order his bed to be
got ready, and she willingly obeyed. When
lie withdrew, Adeline told Louis, what was
indeed unnecessary, the event of La L«c*s
journey, i own, continued she, that 1 had
sometimes suffered myself to hope, and I now
feel this calamity with double force; i fear
too that M. La Luc will sink under its pres-
sure; he is much altered for the worse since
he set out for Paris. Tell me your ©pinion
sincerely*
The change was so obvious that Louis could
not deny it; but he endeavoured to soothe
her apprehension by ascribing this alteration,
in a great measure, to the temporary fatigue
of travelling.' Adeline declared her resolution
of accompanying La Luc to take leave of
Theodore in the morning. 1 know not how
I shall support the interview, said she; but
to see him once more is a duty 1 owe both to
him and myself. The remembrance of having
neglected to give him this last proof of affection
would pursue me with incessant remorse.
After some further conversation on this
subject Louis withdrew I© the prison, rumi-
nating on the best means of imparting to his
friend the fatal intelligence he had to com-
municate. Theodore received it with more
composure than he had expected; but he
asked with impatience why he did not see his
father and Adeline; and - on being informed
that indisposition withheld them, his imagi-
nation seized on the worst possibility, and
suggested that his father was dead. It was a
..considerable time before Louis could convince
•him. of the contrary, and that Adeline was not
dangerously ills when, however, he was^as-
sured that he should see them in the mornings
he became more tranquil. He ^ desired bis
friend would not leave him that night. Thf st

have practised  the precepts of fortitude I

 breathed a heavy sigh, and continued to weep.

La Luc assured him that lie did now, and
should continue to regard Adeline m his
daughter. During those afflicting hours he
'endeavoured to dissipate the terrors of. ap-
proaching death by inspiring his son with
religious confidence. His conversation was
pious, rational,' and consolatory; he spoke
not from' the cold dictates of the head, but
from the feelings of a.heart which had long
loved'and practised the pur© precepts of

Theodore felt -that this would be too much lor
them both, and urged every argument which
reason could suggest to prevail with his fa-
ther to relinquish his design i but he remained
firm in his determination. 1 will not tuffer

Theodore seized on the words of La Luc—

not be witness of it. Your presence, my
dear father, would subdue all my fortitude-
would destroy what little composure 1 may
otherwise be able to attain. Acid not to my
sufferings the view of your distress, but leave
me to. forget, if possible, the dear parent 1

La Luc continued to gaze on him hi silent
agony* At length he said, Well, be it so.
If inoeed my presence would distress you, I
will, not go. Mis voice was,broken and inter-
rupted* After a pause of some-moments he
again embraced Theodore*-We must part,

odore in his arms: and at length seeming to
summon all his fortitude, he again said, We
mutt part—Ob I my son, farewell for ever in
.this world!—The mercy-of Almighty God

He turned away to leave the prison, but
quite worn out with grief, sunk into a chair
near the dcor he would have opened. Theo-
dore gazed, with a distracted countenance,
alternately on his father, or Clara, and on
Adeline, whom he pressed to his throbbing
heart, .and their tears fiowed together. Arid

'pressing her cheek; but it was insensible and
cold as marble.

He proceeded to inform them that he had

pite for Theodore till the Jong*§ further pica*
sure could be known, and this in consequence
of a letter received' that morning from his
mother, Madame de La Mottc, in' which nhe
mentioned some very extraordinary circum*
stances that had appeared in the course of
a trial lately conducted at Paris, and which
so materially affected the character of the
Marquis de Montalt as to render it possible a
pardon might be obtained for Theodore,
'These words darted with the rapidity of
lightning upon the hearts of his hearers. Jm
Luc revived, and that prison so lately the,
scene of despair row echoed only to the voices
of gratitude and gladnets. Jua Luc, rais-
ing his clasped hands to heaven, said^ Great

hut as Madame de La.Motte had. omitted
to mention some circumstance* of importetiee
to be understood, the following' is a relation
of the occurrences that had lately happened
at Paris.'
, it may he remembered that on the .first
-day of life trial, La Motte, in passing from
-the coarti to his prison, saw a person whose
features, though imperfectly seen through
the dusk, he thought he recollected; .and
that this- same person, after inquiring the
name of La Motte, desired to be admitted to
him. On the following day the waider com-
filed with his request, and the surprise of
4& Motte may he imagined when in  the
stronger light of his apartment, he distin-
guished the countenance of the. man, from
whose hands be had formerly received Ade-
line.
On observing Madame de la, Motte m the
room, he said he had something of copse-
quencc to impart, aid desired to be left alone
'with the prisoner.' When «he.was gone, he
told Be lift Motte-that- he undentocd'.lie-waa
confined at the suit of. the Marquis de Mon-
talt. La Motte assented.—I knowblm.Jiw a

La Motte, whose Interest was, now strongly
excited, detired he would - explain .'hinaself;
and the man proceeded to relate a< long his*
tory of the misfortmnei and consequent po-
verty which had tempted, him , to, become <,
subservient to the, schemm-of the Marquis,

caning the motive that had induced him to
become" the Marquis's accuser.—A3s .tir my
motive, 'ft li a very natural one, replied the
man j It Is rto easy matter to receive ill usape
without resenting it, particularly from a vil-
lain whom |om have served—La Motte, for
his own sake, endeavoured to check the vefae.
mence with which this was uttered. I- care
not who hears me continued the stranger, but
at the same time he lowered his voice; I repeat
it—the Marquis has used me ill—I have
ke£t his secret long enough: he does not
think it worth while to secure my silence, or
he would relieve ray necessities. 1 am in
prison for debt, and have applied to him for
relief $ since he does not choose to give it,
let him take the consequence. I warrant he
shall soon repent that he lias provoked me,
and 'tis lit he should.
The doubts of La Motte were now dissi-
pated; the prospect of life again opened upon
him, and he assured Bu Bosse (which was
the stranger's name) with much .warmth, that
he would commission his advocate to do all in
his power to obtain leave for his appearance
on the trial, anil to procure the necessary
condition. 'After some further conversation
they parted.

And bid the cruel tee! the pains they give.
Leave was at length granted for the appear-
ance of Bu Bosse, with a' promise that his
words should not criminate him, and he ac-
companied La Motte into court.
rl%e confusion of the Marquis de Montalt
on perceiving this man was observed by
many persons, present, and particularly by
La Motte, who drew from this circumstance
a favourable presage for himself. _
When Btt Bosse was called, upon, he in-
formed the court, that on the night of the
twenty-first of April, in the preceding year,
one  Jean D'Aunoy, a man he had known
many years, came to his lodging. After they
had discoursed for some time on their, circum-
stances, 'D'Aunoy said he knew a way by
which Du Bosse might change all his poverty
to riches, hut that he would not say more til
he was certain he, would he willing to follow
it. The distressed state in which Bu Bosse
then'was," made him anxious to learn the
meant'which would bring him relief; he
eagerly inquired what Ms friend meant, and
after some time D'Aunoy explained himself*
He said he was employed by a nobleman
(wild he" afterwards told Bu Bosse was the
Marquis de' Montalt). to carry off a young
girl from a convent, and that she was to he
taker* to a house a few leagues distant fmm
Paris* 1 knew the ho»se he ttesoribed well,
saiAJta JBoese, for I had. teen there many
times with 11*Annoy* who lived thete tow#M
his creditors, though he often passed hit
nights at Paris. He would not .tell mm mow
of the scheme, hut said he should want
assistants, and if 1 and my brother, who is
since dead, would join him, his employer
would grudge no money, and we should be
well rewarded, 1 desired him again to tell
me more of the plan, but he was obstinate;
and after I had told him 1 would consider of
what he said, and speak to my brother, he
went away.
When he called the next night for his
answer, my brother and 1 agreed to engage,
and accordingly we. went home with him.
He then told us that the young lady he was
to bring thither was a natural daughter of the
Marquis de Montalt and of a nun belonging
to a convent of Ursulines; that his wife had
received the child immediately on its birth,
and had been allowed a handsome annuity to
bring it up as her own, which she had done
til her death. The child was then placed in
a convent and designed for the veil; but
when she was of an age to receive the vows,
,ghe had steadily persisted in refusing them.
.This circumstance had so much exasperated
the Marquis, that in his rage he ordered that
if she persisted in her obstinacy she should
he removed from the convent, and got rid of
any way; since if she lived in the world her
birth might be.discovered, and in consequence
of this, her mother, for whom he had yet a
regard, would be condemned to expiate her
crime by a terrible death.
Du Bosse was interrupted in his narrative
by the counsel of the Marquis, who contended
that the circumstances alleged tending to
criminate his client, the proceeding wm both
irrelevant and illegal.  He was answered that
it was not irrelevant, and therefore, not illegal;
for that the circumstances which threw light
upon the character of the Marquis, affected
his evidence against La Motte.  J>u Bosse
was suffered to proceed.
. D'Aunoy then said that the Marquis had
ordered him to dispatch her, but that, as he
had been used to see her from her infancy, he
could not End in his heart to do it, and wrote
to tell him so» The Marquis then com-
manded him to find those who would, and
this was the business for which he wanted us.
My brother and I .were not so wicked as this
came to, and so we told IF Annoy; and 1
could not help asking why the Marquis re-
solved to murder his own child rather than
expose her mother to the risque of suffering
death,' He said' the Marquis had never seen
his dhild, and that, therefore, it could not be
supposed he felt much kindness towards it,
and still less that he could Jove it better than
, he loved its mother. .

E
upon, lifer mind, that. It, was hug before she
.could summon resolution to bid.him farewell 5
find when she had done mr and even left; the
upwtaent, she .returned to take of him a last
loolw A$ she was once more quitting the
room, her melancholy imagination represented
I'heodore at the place of execution, pale, and
convulsed In death; she again turned, her
lingering eves upon him; but fancy affected
her sense, tor she thought as she now gaaed
that I|» countenance changed, and assumed a
.ghastly hue. All he? resolution vanished {
and snch was the anguish of her heart, that
she resolved to defer her Journey till the mor-
row, though she mast by this means lose the
tnotection of Louis, whose impatience to meet
lis father would not suffer the delay. ^The
triumph of passion, however, was transient;
soothed by the indulgence she promised her-
self, her grief subsided; reason resumed its
Influence; she again saw the necessity of her
immediate departure, and re-collected suffi-
cient resolution to submit. La Luc would
have accompanied her for the purpose of
again soliciting the king in behalf of his son,
had not the extreme weakness and lassitude
to which he was reduced made traveling im-
practicable.
At length, Adeline with a heavy heart
quitted Theodore, notwithstanding bis en-
treaties that she would not undertake the
Journey in bet present weak state, and was
accompanied by Clam and La< Luc to the
inn. The former parted from her friend with
many tears, and much anxiety for her welfare,
but under a hope of soon meeting again*
Should a pardon* be granted to Theodore, La
Luc designed to fetch Adeline from Paris;
twit should this be refused, she was to return
with Peter. He bade her adieu with a fa-
ther*! kindness, which, she repaid with a filial
ffetion, an<l ia her last words conjured him
to attend to the recovery of his health: the
languid smile he assumed seemed to express
that, her solicited©' was vain, and' that he
tJhought his health past fecovery.
Thm Adeline quitted the friends so justly
dearM her, and §0 lately found, for Pari*,
where she was a stranger^ almost without
protection, and compelled to meet a father,
who had pursued her with the utmost cruelty,
in &. public court of justice. The carriage
in leaving Vaceau passed by the prison; she
threw an eager look towards it as she passed;
its.. heavy black vails, and narrow-grated
windows, seemed to frown upon her hopes-
hut Theodore was there, and leaning from
the window: she continued to ga« upon it
till m abrupt turning in the street concealed
|t from' her view. , She then sunk back  in the
,«arrjage, and' yielding, to the melancholy of
he? heart, wept in .silence. Louii was not
,,|ispo§ed, jt/Q.-interrupt it; his thoughts were
$^uusiy, .employed on his father's situation,
find the travellers proceeded matrjrmiks with,
out exchanging a word.
. At Paris, whither m shall now return,
the search after Jean P'Aunoy wm prosecuted
without suceesg. The house ©ft the heath,
described by Du Bosse, was found uninht.
bited, and to the places of his usual resort In
the city, where the officers of the police awaited
htm, he no longer came. It even appeared
doubtful whether he was living, for' he had
absented himself from the houses of bis cu».
ternary rendezvous sometime before the trial
of La Motte; it was therefore certain tli.it
his absence was not occasioned by any thing
which had passed in the courts*
In the solitude of his confinement the
Marquis de Montalt had' leisure to reflect on
the past,' and to repent Of his crimes; but
reflection and repentance formed as yet no
part of his disposition. He turmd with Im-
patience from recollections which produced
only pain, and looked forward to the future
with an endeavour to avert the disgrace and
punishment which he saw impending. The
elegance of his manners had so effectually
veiled the depravity of his heart, that he wan
ft favourite with his sovereign; and on this
circumstance he rested his hope of security.
He, however, severely repented that lie had
indulged the hasty spirit of revenge which
had urged him to the prosecution of La Motte,
and had thus unexpectedly involved him in a
situation dangerous—if not' fatal—-since If
Adeline could not be found he would he
concluded guilty of her death.' But the ap-
pearance of D*Annoy was the circumstance
he most dreaded'; &tm to oppose the possi-
bility of this, he employed secret emissaries
to discover his retreat, and to bribe him to
his interest. • Those were, however as unsuc-
cessful in their research as the officers of p-
liee, and the Marquis at length began to hope
that the man was really (lead.
. 'La Motte 'meanwhile' awaited with trem-
bling impatience the arrival of "his son, when
he should be relieved in some degree from hi*
uncertainty concerning Adeline. On hisjsp-
pearance he re*ted his only hope' oftifs^ since
the evidence against him would lose much
of its validity from the confirmation she would
give of the bad character of his "prosecutor?
and if the Parliament  even condemned La
Motte, the clemency of the king i might jet
operate in his favour.' 
Adeline arrived at Paris after a journey of
several days, dating which she was chiefly
supported by the delicate attentions of'Lows
whom she pitied and 'esteemed, though *«£
could not love.  She wns immediately visited
at the. hotel by Madame' La Motte: ®e
meeting was affecting on both sides. A sen*
of her past conduct excited in the latter an em-
barrassment which the delicacy and goodnesi
of Adeline'vould willingly have spared her;

that hin owti *i)!^ might condemn him, te-
liiaiiVwil for some lime obstinately silent; hut
When the. ifnr>twn whs administered, his te.
fwdutiou gave way, and Sic* conf.s.sed :i crime
of which he had not even been suspected.
It appeared, that, in the year lli-JJ, lJ\\u-
Hoy( together villi one Jaque?. Marti^ny, and
>'ranr:.!i llalliere, had way-laid ami seized
.Henri, Marquis de Montalt, half-brother to
Philippe; and after having robbed him, ant!
'bound his servant to a tree, according to the
orders they hud received, they conveyed him
to the abbey of St- riair, in tlu* distant forest
oi Fontanv'iile, Here he. Has confined tor
some time, till further directions Here received
from Philippe de. Moutait, the pre^-m Mar-
quis, who was then on his estates in a norths rn
province of France. These orders were for
death, and the unfortunate Henri v a-* a-*sas-
ninated in his chamber m the third week of
his confinement at the abbey.
On hearing this, Adeline, grew faint: she
remembered the .MS. she had found, together
with tlu: extraordinary circumstances that
had attended the UUmvi-ry; e%ery n-rve
thrilled with honor, and. raising her '-yes,
she saw tin- countenance of the Marquis over-
spread with the livid paleness of guilt. She
endeavoured, however, to arrest her Heeling
spirits while the mail proceeded in his con-
fession.
When the murder was perpetrated, l>\\n-
nnv had returned to his employes, who ga%e
him the. reward agreed v.)'on, and in a few
months after deHveied into Id.* hands the in-
fant daughter of the late Marquis, whom he
com eyed to a distant p<m of the kingdom,
where, ii'-MiiiMnu tiio name of St. Pierre, he
brought her up as his own thihl, receiving
from the pnsent Marquis ;> considerable an-
nuity for his secrecy,
Adeline, no longer able to struggle with
the tumult of emotions* that now rushed upon
her heart, tittered a deep -ugh and fainted
away. She was carried from the roiui; and
when the confusion occasioned by tin** cir-
runvstancv subsided, Jean P'Aur.oy went nju
He relatrd, that on the death of bis wife,
.Adeline was placed in a convent, from whence
she was afterwards removed to another, where
the .Marquis had destined her to receive the
vows. That her determined rejection of tiu-m
bad occasioned him to resolve hpon her death,
ami that she had accordingly been removed lo
the house' on the heath. PWunoy added,
that bv the Marquis's order he had misled
Pit Nosse with a false story of her birth.
Having, after some time, discovered that his
comrades had deceived him concerning her
death, P'Annoy separated from thorn in en-
mity; but they unanimously determined to
eorw'eal her escape from the Marquis, that
they might enjoy <hi» recompense of their
;-,pji,wi«.l erinu*. So-^e months subsequent
to this permd, bowevei. IVAin.,-; <-.

THE ROMANCE Of THE FOREST.
eyelids, the bitter recollection of his situation
would return, and they fell in anguish on her
bosom*
He congratulated her, and with peculiar
delicacy, on the prospects of life which were
opening to tit"?; said every thing that might
tend to animate and support her, but avoided
dwelling on his own circumstances, except by
expressing his sense of the zeal and kindness
of his commanding officer, and adding that
lie did not despair of finally obtaining a
pardon.
This hone, though but faintly expressed,
and written evidently for the purpose of con-
soling Adeline, did not entirely fail of the
desired effect. She yielded to its enchanting
influence, and forgot for awhile the many
subjects of care and anxiety which surrounded
her. Theodore said little of his father's
health; what lie did say was by no means so
discouraging as the accounts of Clara, who,
less anxious to conceal a truth that must give
pain to Adeline, expressed without reserve
all her apprehension and concern.

Mason.
The day of the trial so anxiously awaited,
and on which the fate of so many persons
depended, at length arrived. Adeline, ac-
companied by M. Verneuil and Madame La
Motte, appeared as the prosecutor' of the
Marquis de Montalt; and D'Aunoy, Du
Bosse, Louis de La Motte, and several other
persons, as witnesses in her cause. The
judges were some of the most distinguished
In France, and the advocates on both sides
Men of eminent abilities. On •& trial of such
importance the court, as may be imagined,
was'crowded with persons of distinction, and
the.  spectacle it presented was strikingly
solomn, yet magnificent.
When she appeared before the tribunal,
Adeline's emotion surpassed all the arts of
disguise; but, adding to the natural dignity
of her ahr an expresniou of soft timidity, and
to her downcast eyes a sweet confusion, it
rendered her an object still more interesting;
and §h« attracted the universal pity and
admiration of the assembly. When she
ventured to raise^ her eyes, she perceived that
the Marquis was not yet in tne court; and
while she awaited his appearance in trembling
expectation, a confused murmuring rose in a
distant part of the halh Her spirits now
almost forsook her-; the certainty of seeing
immediately, and consciously, the murderer
ctf her father,' chilled her with horror, and she
was with difficulty preserved from fainting.
4'.'l©W"'»itnd now run through the court, and
an air of confusion appeared, which was %om
communicated to the tribunal itself, Several
of the members arose, some left the hall, the
whole place exhibited a scene of disoider, and
a report at length reached Adeline that the
Marquis de Montalt was dying. A consi-
derable time elapsed in uncertainty; but the
confusion continued.; the Marquis did not
appear, and at Adeline's request M. Verneuil
went in quest of more positive information,
He followed a crowd which was hurrying
towards the Chatelet, and with some difficulty
gained admittance into the prison; but the
porter at the gate, whom he had bribed for a
passport, could give him no certain informs,
tion on the subject of his inquiry, and not
being at liberty to quit his post, furnished
M. Verneuil witli only a vague direction to
the Marquis's apartment. The courts were
silent and deserted; but as he advanced, a
distant hum of voices led him on, till, per-
ceiving several persons running towards a
staircase which appeared beyond the archway
of a long passage, he followed thither, and
learned that the Marquis was certainly dying.
The staircase was filled with people; lie en-
deavoured to press through the crowd, and
after much struggle and difficulty he readied
the door of an ante-room which communi-
cated with the apartment where the Marquis
lay, and whence several persons now issued,
Here he learned that the object of his inquiry
was, already dead. M. Verneuil, however,
pressed through the ante-room to the chamber
where lay the Marquis on a bed surrounded
by officers of the law, and two notaries, who
appeared to have been taking down deposi-
tions. His countenance was suffused with
a black and deadly hue, arid impressed with
the horrors of death* M. Verneuil turned
away, shocked by the spectacle; and on in-
quiry heard that the Marquis had died by
poison.
It appeared that, convinced he had nothing
to hope from his trial, he had . taken this
method of avoiding an ignominious death.
In the last hours of life, while tortured with
the femembranee of his crime, he resolved to
make all the atonement that remained for
him; and having swallowed the potion, lie
immediately sent for a confessor to take a
full confession of his guilt, and two notaries,
and thus establish Adeline beyond dispute in
the fights of her birth t and also bequeathed
her a considerable legacy.
In consequence of these depositions she
was soon after formally acknowledged as the
daughter and heiress of Henri, Marquis de
Montalt, and the rich estates of her fathei
were restored to her. She immediately threw
herself at the feet of the king in behalf of
Theodore and of La Motte. The character

Marquis • enmity towards Mm, were circum-
stance* so notorious and m forcible, that It is
motif titftn probable the monarch would have
grunted Mn pardon to a pleader less irresis-
tible than was Adeline tic Montalt. Theo-
dore La Iaic not only received an ample par-
don, hut, in consideration of his gallant
conduct towards Add see, lie was soon after
raised to a jwt of considerable rank in the
unity.
For La Mmtc, who had been condemned
for the robbery on full evidence, and who had
fnvn also charged with the crime which Intel
formerly compelled him to quit Paris, a par-
don could not be obtained ; hut, at the earnest
supplication of Adeline, and in consideration
of lot* service lie had filially rendered her, his
sentence was softened from death to banish-
ment. This indulgence, however, would have
availed him little, bad not the noble generosity
of Adeline silenced other prosecutions that
were preparing against him, and bestowed on
hint a sunt more than sufficient to support
his family in a foreign country. This kindness
operated so powerfully upon Ills heart, which
had been betrayed through weakness rather
than natural depravity, and awakened so
keen a remorse for the injuries he had once
meditated against a benefactress so noble,
that his former habits became odious to him,
and his character gradually recovered the hue
which it would probably always have worn
had lie never been exposed to the tempting
dissipations of Paris,
The passion which Louis had so long
©ward for Adeline was raised almost to ado-
ration by her late conduct; but he now relin-
quished even the faint hope which he had
hitherto almost unconsciously cherished;
and since the life which was granted to Theo-
dore rendered this sacrifice necessary, he
could not repine. He resolved, however, to
seek in absence the tranquillity lie bad lost,
and to place his future happiness on that of
two persons so deservedly dear to him.
On the eve of bis departure, La Motto
find his faintly took a very affecting leave of
Adeline; he left Paris for England, where
it was his design to settle; and Louis, who
was eager to fly from her enchantments, set
out on the same day for his regiment.
Adeline remained some time at Paris to
settle, her affairs, where she was introduced
by M. Verncuil to the few and distant rela-
tions that remained of her family. Among
these were the Count and Countess D_,
and the Monsieur Amand who bad so much
engaged her pity and esteem at Nice. The
lady whose death he lamented was of the
family of Be Montalt; ami the resemblance
which he had traced between her features and
those of Adeline, her cousin, was something
more than the effect of fancy. The death d
hit elder brother had' abruptly recalled Mil,
from Italy; but Adeline lad the satisfaction
to observe, that the heavy melancholy which
formerly oppressed him, had .yielded to a
sort of placid resignation, and that his coun-
tenance was often enlivened by a transient
gleam of cheerfulness*
The Count and Countess I>——r»^ who
were much interested by her goodness and
beauty, invited her to make their hotel her
residence while she remained at Parts,
Her first care was to have the remains of
her parent removed from the abbey of St.
Clair, and deposited in the vault of hia an*
cestui'*. JPAunoy wa« tried, condemned,
and hanged, for the murder. At the place
of execution he had described the spot where
the remains of the Marquis were concealed,
which was in the atone room already men*
tioncd belonging to the abbey. M. Vcrneuil
accompanied the officers appointed for the
search, and attended the ashes of the Mar-
quis to $L Maur, an estate in one of the
not them provinces. There they were depo*
sited will) the solemn funeral pomp becoming
his rank ; Adeline attended as chief mourner;
and this last duty paid to the memory of her
parent, she became more tranquil and re-
signed. The MS. that recorded his suiter*
lugs had been (mini at the abbey, and
delivered to her by M. Vcrneuil, and she
preserved it with the pious enthusiasm so
sacred a rcliquc deserved.
On her return to Paris, Theodore La Luc,
who was come from Montpcllicr, awaited
her arrival. The happiness of this meeting
was clouded by the account he brought of
his father, whose extreme danger had alone
withheld him from hastening the moment he
obtained his liberty to thank Adeline for the
life she had preserved. She now received
him as the friend to whom she was indebted
for her preservation, and as the lover 'Who
deserved and possessed her tenderesi affection.
The remembrance of the circumstances under
which they had last met, and of their mutual
anguish, rendered more exquisite the'hap-
piness of the present momenta, when, no
longer oppressed by the horrid prospect  of
ignominious death and final separation^they
looked forwaid only to the smiling days' that
awaited them, when hand in  hand they
should tread the flowery scones of life. The
contrast which memory drew of the past
with the present, frequently drew tears of
tenderness and gratitude to their eyes \ and
the sweet wnile which' seemed struggling to
dispel from the countenance of Adeline those
gems of sorrow, penetrated the heart of Theo-
dore, and brought to his recollection a. little
song which in other circumstance* he1 had
formerly sung to her. He took up a,'Title
that lay on the table, and touching the inkei
chord}*, accompanied it with the following

Iter affection for Theodore had induced
'Adeline to reject" several suitor* whom her
goodness, heauty, and wealth, had already
attracted,, and who, though infinitely his
superiors hi uohit of fortune, were many of
them inferior to him in family, and all of
them in merit.
.The various and tumultuous emotions
which the late events had called forth in the
bosom of Adeline were now subsided; hut
the memory of her father still tinctured he?
inind with a melancholy that time only could
subdue'; and she refused to listen to the sup-
plications of Theodore, till the period she had
pi escribed for her mourning should be ex-
pired. The necessity of rejoining his regi-
ment obliged him to leave Paris within the
fortnight after his arrival; but he carried
with'him assurance of receiving her hand
soon after she should lay aside her sable
habit, and departed therefore with tolerable
composure.
', M. La Luc*$ very precarious state was a
source of incessant disquietude to Adeline,
and she determined to accompany M. Ver-
Jieuil,, who was now the declared lover of

Immediately .gone on the liberation of his

wliep she received from her friend a flattering

and 'M. Verncuil departed alone*

Adeline, in the society of friends so be.
loved, lost the impression of that melancholy
which the fate of her parent had occasioned:
she recovered aE her natural vivacity; and
when she threw off the mourning habit which
filial piety had required her to assume, she
gave her hand to Theodore. The nuptials,
which were celebrated at St. Maur, were
graced by the presence of the Count and
Countess D—»*-*; and La Luc had the
supreme felicity of confirming on the same
day the flattering destinies of both his chil-
dren. When the ceremony was over, lie
blessed and embraced them all with team of
fatherly affection* I thank thee, O flod!
that 1 have been permitted to see this hour,
said he; .whenever it shaE please thee to call
me hence, I shall depart in peace.
Long, very long, may you be spared to
bless your children! replied Adeline. Clara
kissed her father's hand and wept j Ixmg,
very long I she repeated in a voice scarcely
audible. La Luc smiled cheerfully, and
turned the conversation to a subject less
affecting*
Bat the time now drew nigh when lift Luc
thought it necessary to return 'to the duties of
his parish, from which he had so long been
absent, Madame La Luc too, who had at-
tended him during the period of his danger
at MontpeHler, and hence returned to Savoy,
complained much of the solitude of her life;
and this was with her brother an additional
motive .for his speedy departure* Theodore
sod Adeline, who could not tmpport the
thought of a separation, endeavoured to
pmnade him to give up his chateau, and to
wide with them in France; but he was held
by many ties to Leloncourt. for many
years he had constituted the comfort and
happiness of his parishioners; they revered
and loved 'him as a fathef—he'regarded them
.'with an affection little short of parental.

Since La Luc would not reside in France,
Theodore and Adeline, to whom the splendid

inferior temptations to the awect domestic
pleasures and refined society which Ijeloncoui*-*
would afford, determined to accompany Ia
Luc and Monsieur und Madame Funiculi

and having hid an affectionate adieu to the
I 'mint and Countess D——, and to M. Amand,
who had recovered a tolerable degree of cheer-
fulness, she departed with her friends for
Savoy.
They travelled leisurely, and frequently
turned oat of their way to view whatever was
worthy of observation. After a long and
pleasant journey they catme once more within
view of the Swiss mountains, the sight of
winch revived a thousand interesting recol-
lections in the mind of Adeline. She re-
me inhered the circumstances and the sensa-
tions under which she had first seen them—
when an orphan, flying from persecution to
t»eek shelter among strangers, and lost to the
only person on earth whom she loved,—she
remembered this, and the contrast of the pre-
£cnt. moment struck with all its force upon
her heart*
The countenance of Clam brightened into
smiles of the most animated delight as she
drew new the beloved scenes of her infant
pleasure*; and Theodore, often looking from
the windows, caught with patriotic enthusiasm
the, magnificent and changing scenery which
the receding mountains successively disclosed*
It was evening when they approached within

tog round the foot of a stupendous crag, 'pre-
sented them a full view of the lake, and of
the peaceful dwelling of La hue. An ex.
damation ©f joy from the whole party an-
nounced the discovery, and the glance of
pleasure was refected from every eye. The
inn's last .light gleamed upon the waters that
reposed in « crystal parity" below, mellowed
every feature.of the landscape, and touched
with purple splendour the clouds that rolled
•long the mountain tops.

line continued to gaze upon each well known
object; and again reflecting oh the 'vteiasi*
tucks of grief and joy,' and the dhrpriaing
change of fortune which she had eiptrlfincetf
since last she saw them* her heart diluted with
gratitude and complacent delight. She looked
at Theodore, whom in these very scenes she
had lamented m lost to her for ever $ wh%
when found again* wa§ about to be, torn, from
her by an ignominious death; but,'who noV

from her eyes, a smile of ineffable tcriderneJto
told him all she felt,' He gently pressed hut
hand, and answered her with a look of low.
Peter, who now rode up to the carriage with
a face fall of joy and of importance, Inter-
rupted a course of sentiment which was to*
come almost too interesting. Ah I mj dem
master! cried he, welcome home again. Here
is the village, Clod Mess itf It h worth a
million such places as Paris, Thank St.
Jaciucs, we are all come safe back again.
This effusion of honest Peter** Joy- waa
received and answered with the Mildness it
deserved. As they drew near the lake, music
sounded over the water, and they presently
saw a large party of the villagers assembled
on a green spot that sloped to the very margin
of the waves, and dancing in all their holiday
finery. It was the evening of a festival. The
elder peasants sat under the shade of the treea
that crowned this little eminence, eatirigtoilk
and fruits, and watching their sobs , and
daughters frisk It away to the sprightly notes
of the tabor and pipe, which was joined by
the softer tones of a mandolin. ''
The icene was highly interesting; and what
added to its picturesque beauty was a 'gnm]>
of cattle that stood, some on the brink, some
half hi the water, and others reposing m
the green bank, while several permit girls,
dressed in the neat simplicity of their country,
were dispensing the milky feast, Pete »6w
rode on first, and a crowd soon collected Wind
him, who, learning that their beloved masted
was at hand, went forth to meet and welcofrte
him. Their warm and honett expretsioss of
Joy diffused an exquisite satisfaction over the
heart of the good La Lac, 'who met them
with the kindness of a father, and could
scarcely forbear shedding team to Alt testi-
mony of their attachment* When the yoi&toger
part &f the peasants heard the Dews of lis
arrival, the general joy was such, that, led by
the tabor and pipe, they danced before his
carriage to the chateau, where they again
welcomed him and his family with the) en-'1

When tile repast wa» over, €kra, whose

moonbeams are already dancing on the waters.

They all agreed to the proposal.—And let

tables were placing, Clara ran for her favourite

touched with a melancholy expression* Clara's
light hand now ran over the chords, and drew
forth tones of tender sweetness, her foice

Peter, who could not move in a sober step,
had already spread refreshments under the
teee§, and in a short time the lawn was en-
circled with peasantry. The rural pipe and

'the shade of her beloved acacias on the margin
of the lake 5 the merry notes of music sounded,
Adeline led off the dance, and the mountains
answered only to the strains of mirth and
melody.

the elder peasants, surveyed the scene—his
children and people thus assembled round
him in one grand compact of harmony and
Joy—.the frequent tear bedewed his cheek,
and he seemed to taste the fulness of an
exalted delight*
go much was every heart roused to glad.
«es§f that the mowing dawn began to peep
upon the scene of their festivity, when every
cottager returned to his bome> blessing the
benevolence of 1a Lac.
After passing some weeks with 1a Luc,
BL Verneuil bought a chateau in the village
of Leloncourt; and as it was the only one
not already occupied, Theodore looked out
for a residence in the neighbourhood. At the
distance of a few leagues, on the beautiful
banks of the lake of Geneva, where the waters
retire into a small bay, he put chased a villa.
The chateau was characterized by an air of
simplicity and* taste rather than of magnifi-
cence, which, however, was the chief trait in
the surrounding scene* The chateau was
almost encircled with woods, which formed a
grand amphitheatre, sweot down to the water's
edge, and abounded with wild and romantic
walks. Here nature was suffered to sport in
all her beautiful luxuriance, except where,
•.ere and there, the hand of art formed the
foliage to admit a view of the blue waters of
the lake, with the white sail that glided by,
or of the distant mountains. In front of the
chateau the woods opened to a lawn, and the
eye was suffered to wander over the lake,
whose bosom presented an ever-moving pic-
tare, while to varied margin sprinkled with
villas, woods, and towns, and crowned beyond
with the snowy and sublime Alps, rising
point behind point in awful confusion, ex-
fiibitcd a scenery of almost unequalled mag-
nificence.
Here, contemning the splendour of false
happiness, anil possessing the pure and rational
delights of love refined into the most tender
friendship, surrounded by the friends so clear
to them, and visited by a select and enlightened
society—here, in the very bosom of felicity,
lived Theodore and Adeline La Luc
The passion of Louis de La Motte yielded
at length to the powers of absence and ne-
cessity. He still loved Adeline, but it was
with the placid tenderness of friendship ; and
when, at the earnest invitation of Theodore,
he visited the villa, he beheld their happ*
ness with a satisfaction unalloyed by any
emotions of envy. He afterwards married 1
lady of some fortune at Geneva; and resign*
ing his commission in the French service
settled on the borders of the lake, and increased
the social delights of Theodore and Adeline.
Their former lives afforded an example 0!
trials well endured—and their present, of
virtues greatly rewarded; and this reward
they continued to deserve—for, not to them-
selves was their happiness contracted, but
diffused to all who came within the sphere c*

enlightened in their friendship, and their
children in parents whose exampleimprwfwi
