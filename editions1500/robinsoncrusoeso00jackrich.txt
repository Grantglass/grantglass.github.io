ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL 
ENGINEER 



"Robinson Crusoe, a fairy tale to the child, a book of 
adventure to the young, is a work on social philosophy to 
the mature. It is a picture of civilization. The essential 
moral attributes of man, his innate impulses as a social being, 
his absolute dependence on society, even as a solitary indi- 
vidual, his subjection to the physical world, and his alliance 
with the animal world, the statical elements of social philos- 
ophy, and the germs of man's historical evolution have never 
been touched with more sagacity, and, assuredly, have never 
been idealized with such magical simplicity and truth/'

FOREWORD 

IN remote recesses of lonely mountain sides trav- 
elers frequently have found the skeleton remains of 
two animals lying side by side, as if they had per- 
ished together by mutual consent. It is a curious 
phenomenon. 

It means that two buck deer had engaged in mor- 
tal combat and locked horns in a war of extermina- 
tion, from which the only escape was by slow star- 
vation. It was a peace without victory for either. 
It was the peace of death. Neither could entangle 
the other without entangling himself. You cannot 
hold another man down in the gutter without remain- 
ing down in the gutter with him. 

The tragedy of the horn-locked deer aptly exhibits 
the condition of capitalists and laborers during the 
past one hundred and fifty years. They, too, as in 
the case of the deer, have like interests. These like 
interests are common interests. Industrial conflicts 
are, therefore, civil wars. Mutual hatred, as with 
the deer, has blinded them to this fact and produced 
tragic results. 

The aim of this book is to state, in popular and 
picturesque fashion, what the discovery of a commu- 
nity of interest would mean to modern industry. The 

vii

author believes that a policy built on this discovery 
is the path to industrial peace, and that there is no 
other. He also believes that this principle has the 
creative power to build a New Industrial America.

PART 1 

THE SECRET OF ROBINSON CRUSOE'S 
POPULARITY 



"Robinson Crusoe" contains, not for boys but for men, 
more religion, more philosophy, more political economy, 
more anthropology, than are found in many elaborate 
treatises on these special subjects.

POPULARITY 



CHAPTER I 

AN UNDISCOVERED BOOK 

/ "T" N HAT "Robinson Crusoe" challenges modern 
industry on the foundation of its structure and 
also offers the solution of its problem which, if 
operated, guarantees to open the path to permanent 
industrial peace, is the audacious proposition which 
this book undertakes to demonstrate. It looks like 
a big contract. It is. But the writer believes that 
it is not only not an impossible task, but will reveal 
the obvious and only solution of industrial unrest. 
Inasmuch as the obvious is always the last thing 
discovered, it will be necessary, for the sake of 
clarity, to take the reader on a quest for the secret 
of the amazing popularity of "Robinson Crusoe." 
When this secret is made apparent, it will lead us 
by an unmistakable path to the heart of our ques- 
tion. As compensation to the reader for the delay 
in coming to grips with the subject, the romantic

>; :thb> remarkable book will entertain him 
sufficiently while he journeys toward the application 
of its secret to the labor problem. 

It is rare pleasure to a writer or speaker, when he 
feels that he is introducing his audience to a subject 
new and fresh. It is likewise a pleasure to his 
audience. Such a pleasure is now ours, for my 
subject is : "The life and strange, surprising adven- 
tures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner, who 
lived eight and twenty years all alone in an uninhab- 
ited island off the coast of America, near the mouth 
of the great river Aroonoque; having been cast on 
shore by shipwreck, wherein all the men perished 
but himself. With an account how he was at last 
as strangely delivered by pirates. Written by him- 
self." 

The title page here quoted undoubtedly has a 
familiar sound and carries us far back across the 
years to the days of fresh delight, when as boys 
we joined Crusoe in our imagination in those 
strange adventures out into the big world, and often 
wished we might have done so in reality. For 
almost every boy and girl has entertained the secret 
desire and purpose to run away from home, because 
they find the world of adulthood too tame and too 
oppressive. To that mood in a boy's life, Crusoe 
makes an irresistible appeal and also supplies a 
soothing antidote. At least he can make his adven- 
ture by proxy and enjoy the thrill of it vicariously. 

How then can it be said that a book is new and 



AN UNDISCOVERED BOOK 5 

fresh which has been read by every boy and girl in 
the English-speaking world for the past two hun- 
dred years? No kind of subject is so difficult to 
understand the inner meaning of as is the thing we 
think we already know. The significance of the 
commonplace eludes us just because it is regarded 
as commonplace. It is handicapped by too much 
superficial familiarity. Every one, for example, is 
quite sure that he knows the color of apple blos- 
soms or the meaning of the Lord's Prayer, whereas 
a few test questions disclose the fact that it is rare 
to find anyone who understands either of them. 

In order to learn the true nature of familiar 
things, it is necessary to go through the process of 
unlearning the false. But to unlearn is a painful 
process, especially if the process runs counter to 
self-interest, or to childhood impressions. Both of 
these influences have delayed the discovery of the 
real "Robinson Crusoe." It may serve to awaken us 
to the value of this undiscovered book, if we observe 
the curious use made of it by one of the characters 
in Wilkie Collins' "Moonstone." 

In this story, the old servant, Gabriel Betteredge, 
has a superstitious reverence for "Robinson Cru- 
soe." The book is his Bible. "I have read," he 
says, "a heap of books in my time; I am a scholar 
in my own way. Though turned seventy, I possess 
an active memory, and legs to correspond. You are 
not to take it, if you please, as the saying of an 
ignorant man, when I express my opinion that such 



6 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

a book as 'Robinson Crusoe' never was written be- 
fore, and never will be written again. 

"I have tried that book for years generally in 
combination with a pipe of tobacco and I have 
found it my friend in need in all the necessities of 
this mortal life. When my spirits are bad 'Rob- 
inson Crusoe.' When I want advice 'Robinson 
Crusoe.' In past times, when my wife plagued me ; 
in present times, when I have had a drop too much 
'Robinson Crusoe. 7 

"I have worn out six stout Robinson Crusoes with 
hard work in my service. On my lady's last birth- 
day she gave me a seventh. I took a drop too much 
on the strength of it; and 'Robinson Crusoe' put me 
right again. Price four shillings and sixpence, 
bound in blue, with a picture into the bargain." 

Betteredge consulted the book frequently for 
prophetic warning and counsel. On one occasion, 
for example, he was trying to dissuade Dr. Jennings 
from a certain medical experiment he was trying. 
"Mr. Jennings, do you happen to be acquainted with 
'Robinson Crusoe'?" I answered that I had read 
"Robinson Crusoe" when I was a child. "Not since 
then?" inquired Betteredge. "Not since then." He 
fell back a few steps, and looked at me with an 
expression of compassionate curiosity, tempered by 
superstitious awe. "He has not read 'Robinson 
Crusoe' since he was a child," said Betteredge, 
speaking to himself not to me. "Let's try how 
'Robinson Crusoe' strikes him now!" 



AN UNDISCOVERED BOOK 7 

"When the work-people are gone, my feelings as 
a man get the better of my duty as a servant. Very 
good. Last night, Mr. Jennings, it was borne in 
powerfully on my mind that this new medical enter- 
prise of yours would end badly. If I had yielded 
to that secret Dictate, I should have put all the 
furniture away again with my own hands, and have 
warned the workmen off the premises when they 
came the next morning." 

"I am glad to find, from what I have seen up- 
stairs," I said, "that you resisted the secret Dic- 
tate." "Resisted isn't the word," answered Better- 
edge. "Wrostled is the word. I wrostled sir, 
between the silent orders in my bosom pulling me 
one way, and the written orders in my pocket-book 
pushing me the other, until, saving your presence, 
I was in a cold sweat. In that dreadful perturbation 
of mind and laxity of body, to what remedy did I 
apply? To the remedy, sir, which has never failed 
me yet for the last thirty years and more to This 
Book! 

"What did I find here," pursued Betteredge, "at 
the first page I opened? This awful bit, sir, page 
one hundred and seventy-eight, as follows: 'Upon 
these, and many like Reflections, I afterward made 
it a certain rule with me, That whenever I found 
those secret Hints or Pressings of my Mind, to 
doing, or not doing any Thing that presented; or to 
going this Way, or that Way, I never failed to 
obey the secret Dictate.' As I live by bread, Mr. 



8 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

Jennings, those were the first words that met my 
eye, exactly at the time when I myself was setting 
the secret Dictate at defiance ! You don't see any 
thing at all out of the common in that, do you 
sir?" 

"I see a coincidence nothing more." "You 
don't feel at all shaken, Mr. Jennings, in respect 
to this medical enterprise of yours?" "Not the 
least in the world." Betteredge stared hard at 
me, in dead silence. He closed the book with great 
deliberation; he locked it up again in the cupboard 
with extraordinary care; he wheeled round, and 
stared hard at me once more. Then he spoke. 
"Sir," he said, gravely, "there are great allowances 
to be made for a man who has not read 'Robinson 
Crusoe' since he was a child. I wish you good- 
morning." 

The supreme place assigned to "Robinson Cru- 
soe" in this old man's affections may seem to some 
too exalted, but his fine scorn of the man who has 
not read it since he was a boy is a point well taken. 
The book may be enjoyed by a boy; it can only be 
known by a thoughtful man. 



CHAPTER II 

A BOOK CAPTURED BY BOYS 

\T 7TTH no desire to indulge in unseemly boasting, 
but simply to point out an interesting fact, 
I venture the assertion that I have accomplished a 
task which has not been performed by one man 
in a thousand; I have read the whole of "Robinson 
Crusoe." Not that this is especially a praiseworthy 
performance, but it shows how little is generally 
known of "Robinson Crusoe," beyond the story of 
his shipwreck and island life. There are three parts 
to "Robinson Crusoe." First the story of the ship- 
wreck and the lonely island life, known to almost 
all. Second, the story of his second visit to the 
island and his journey to the Far East, returning 
through China and Siberia, known to a few. 
Third, the Serious Reflections of Robinson Crusoe, 
known to almost none. 

The first part of Robinson Crusoe became so 
immediately and universally popular and was found 
to be so rich a vein of gold that Defoe could not 
resist working it still further by producing a second 
and even a third part. He realized the danger of 
weakening his first success by trying to add to it, 
for in his preface to the second part he says, "The 

9 



10 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

second part, if the editor's opinion may pass, is 
(contrary to the usage of second parts) every way 
as entertaining as the first." The world has not 
agreed with the editor. 

The most the majority of men know of "Robinson 
Crusoe" is half of the first part. I say half of the 
first part, because when a boy reads it, as all boys 
do, the serious and moral reflections, which it con- 
tains, are neither a comfort nor discomfort to him. 
He just plods through them. They mean nothing 
to him, and since few read the book, when they 
become men, the thing which they remember, as 
men, is the story only. 

It is a significant fact that the part of "Robinson 
Crusoe," which Defoe regarded as subordinate and 
which he half apologized for, is the part which the 
world has chiefly prized, and the part which he 
chiefly prized, the world has mostly neglected. In 
the preface to the second part, he says of the first 
part, "The just application of every incident, the 
religious and useful inferences drawn from every 
part are so many testimonies to the good design 
of making it public and must legitimate all the parts 
that may be called invention or parable in the 
story." 

He even becomes pugnacious in his further re- 
mark that, "Abridging this work is as scandalous 
as it is knavish and ridiculous; seeing while to 
shorten the book they may seem to reduce the 
value, they strip it of all those reflections which, as 



A BOOK CAPTURED BY BOYS 11 

well religious as moral, are not only the greatest 
beauties of the work, but are calculated for the 
infinite advantage of the reader." 

Defoe felt that the moral reflections were the 
real beauties of the work, and that the story needed 
them to make its use legitimate. But the world 
has completely reversed his judgment. And for 
good reason. The eighteenth century novelists were 
essentially preachers. Richardson and Fielding 
preach quite as much as Defoe. They were like 
{Stevenson, who said that he "would rise from the 
idead to preach." But none of them had learned, as 
Stevenson did, that it adds nothing but weakness to 
a story to tag it with a moral, that every good 
story does its own preaching more effectively than 
any moral tag can do. 

Moreover as a work of art, "Robinson Crusoe" 
ends when he leaves the island, although the second 
part contains many passages of real interest. The 
third part is well worth reading on its own account. 
It is in fact a collection of six moral essays on such 
subjects as "Solitude," "Honesty," "Conversation," 
the point of departure in each essay being some point 
of contact with the experience of Crusoe. They are 
quite worth reading. Yet the second and third 
parts add nothing to the first as a work of art. 
When Crusoe ceases to be a solitary and is brought 
into touch with civilization, the dramatic interest 
in the story, as well as its significance, ceases, so 
far as his own day was concerned. But the dramatic 



12 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

interest and significance have been given rebirth by 
the English Industrial Revolution which occurred 
since Defoe wrote. A second part could not have 
been written with success in his day; it can now. 

Defoe ran a real risk in attempting to prolong his 
first success, a risk which the fate of the second and 
third parts abundantly shows. It is a striking con- 
firmation from literature of the great principle in 
Hesiod's apparent parodox that the half is more 
than the whole. It is like the story of the young 
gentleman who wished to signalize the birthday of 
his lady love by sending her twenty roses, one for 
each year of her life. He had been lavish in his 
expenditure at the florist shop and that worthy, 
on receiving an order to send the finest roses, re- 
gardless of expense, bettered his instructions and 
sent the young lady thirty roses. The result may 
be imagined. Twenty roses were an appropriate 
gift; thirty were an insult. One old horseshoe is 
good luck; a wagon load of them is junk. It was 
undoubtedly to the first part that Dr. Johnson ap- 
plied his remark when he asked, u Was there ever 
anything written by mere man that was wished 
longer by its readers excepting 'Don Quixote,' 
'Robinson Crusoe/ and the 'Pilgrim's Progress?' ' 
If no one can read the first part without wishing it 
longer, Defoe ought not to be blamed too severely 
for yielding to this desire and making it longer. 

When the first part is considered alone it is not 
quite fair to Defoe to say that he tagged a moral to 



A BOOK CAPTURED BY BOYS 13 

his story. The fact is, he tagged the story to the 
moral. The fable is always made for the moral, 
he says, not the moral for the fable. That is to 
say, his purpose was to write a serious philosophical 
book and he used the story to illustrate his moral 
principles. He distinctly says in the preface, "The 
story is told with modesty, with seriousness, and 
with a religious application of events, to the uses 
to which wise men always apply them, namely, to 
the instruction of others, and the editor thinks, with- 
out further compliment to the world, he does them 
a great service in the publication." 

The use which the old servant in Wilkie Collins' 
"Moonstone" made of it, as a practical moral guide- 
book, although whimsical, was nevertheless the use 
which Defoe intended should be made of it. The 
fact about the book, to which I call particular atten- 
tion a fact very frequently overlooked is that 
"Robinson Crusoe" is primarily a deeply religious 
and philosophical book. It, therefore, is enjoyed by 
two classes of people : by the boy for the sake of the 
story; by the man for the sake of the. philosophy. 
It is good story-telling and good philosophy both in 
one. But the philosophy was first in Defoe's mind. 
This fact has, of course, been frequently recognized. 
At one time during the period of the French Rev- 
olution the book was excluded from the public 
schools of France on the ground that it was too 
religious. Such men as Franklin and Lincoln have 
left it on record that "Robinson Crusoe" was one of 



14 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the few books that influenced them permanently for 
good. Their judgment is trustworthy for they were 
not surfeited by too many books. Someone made 
the brilliant remark that Lincoln was raised on five 
books and consequently he grew up with "an unlit- 
tered mind." 

It is one of the curious accidents of literary his- 
tory that the best boys' book ever written was never 
intended to be such at all. It was not written for 
boys; it was captured by them. "Robinson Crusoe" 
was not written for children, because at the time 
Defoe wrote it, there were no children; there were 
only grown-ups. The little people were not treated 
as children, or educated, or written for, or read 
to as children. The discovery of childhood is a 
comparatively recent discovery. The adaptation of 
material for children, however, should not lead us 
to suppose that it must be weakened. Children are 
fortunately different from adults, but not inferior. 
Quite the contrary. It is the commonest of mistakes 
to underrate them. It has helped us to discover the 
capacity and seriousness of children to notice that 
the best books for boys are books not primarily 
written for them. "Robinson Crusoe" is the out- 
standing illustration of this fact. Defoe was doubt- 
less totally unaware that he had written one of the 
few immortal books in the English language and 
the best boys' book ever produced. Emerson once 
remarked to Thoreau : "Who would not like to write 
something which all can read, like 'Robinson Cru- 



A BOOK CAPTURED BY BOYS 15 

soe ?' ' Defoe did not consciously try to write some- 
thing that all could read. He did not write down to 
children. What happened was that the romantic 
and philosophic interest in his story was discovered 
to be so universal as to appeal to boys and men 
alike. 



CHAPTER III 

A JOKE ON THE BRITISH NATION 

* I V HE origin of the book is quite as astonishing as 
** the book itself. It is a real romance in the 
history of literature. It was on this wise : Defoe 
had been a favorite with King William, because of 
the publication of a pamphlet in rhyme, called, "The 
True-Born Englishman." Its object was to show 
that those, who found fault with King William, 
because he was a foreigner, had no ground for their 
criticism, for the whole population of England was 
made up of the mingling of different nationalities 
and every man ought to be judged, therefore, by his 
devotion to the interests of Britain, not by his race 
or birth. After showing that the true-born English- 
man is a myth, because the English are a hopelessly 
mixed race, he proceeds: 

From this amphibious ill-born mob began 
That vain ill-natured thing, an Englishman. 
These are the heroes that despise the Dutch, 
And rail at new-come foreigners so much, 
Forgetting that themselves are all derived 
From the most scoundrel race that ever lived; 
A horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones, 
Who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopled towns, 
The Pict and painted Briton, treacherous Scot, 

16 



A JOKE ON THE BRITISH NATION 17 

By hunger, theft and rapine hither brought ; 
Norwegian pirates, buccaneering Danes, 
Whose red-haired offspring everywhere remains, 
Who, joined with Norman-French, compound the breed 
From whence your true-born Englishmen proceed. 

The poem was read by everybody and a great 
wave of laughter passed over London. Defoe had 
ridiculed out of the country the unreasoning preju- 
dice against the foreigner. The poem did King 
William immense service and Defoe made a thou- 
sand pounds by its sale. But the verse was not of 
a high order. It began with the well-known lines: 

Wherever God erects a house of prayer, 
The Devil always builds a chapel there: 
And 't will be found upon examination, 
The latter has the largest congregation. 

Defoe was the first rhymer of this old proverb 
and the rider to it is his own. He was very proud 
of his poetry. He entertained the opinion that this 
poem was a better bid for fame than was "Robinson 
Crusoe." 

When King William died suddenly from an acci- 
dent, Defoe's fortunes changed. The High Church 
party came back into power with Queen Anne. A 
bill was introduced in Parliament against occasional 
conformity, that is, the device by which dissenters 
managed to hold public office, by kneeling now and 
then at the altars of the established Church and re- 
ceiving the Communion. The discussions on this 



18 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

subject led to one of the most striking episodes in 
Defoe's life. He had himself written against the 
practice of occasional conformity as an insincere act, 
and had angered his own party, the dissenters, by 
his plain speech. But he now flew to their rescue, 
when the High Church party, intoxicated by their 
newly acquired power, began to bluster out threats 
against them. 

It occurred to Defoe that the most effective 
weapon to employ against the wild threats of the 
high-fliers was ridicule, and he used it remorselessly. 
He published his pamphlet, "The Shortest Way to 
Deal with Dissenters." It was an elaborate and 
serious statement of the violent talk of the high- 
fliers. He carried out these extreme views to their 
logical issue and reduced them to a practical pro- 
posal, the proposal, namely, that all dissenting min- 
isters should be hanged and their congregations 
broken up and outlawed. He supported this thesis 
with historical and logical reasons in such a masterly 
manner that no one suspected that it was only a 
boyish prank. In writing it Defoe never winked an 
eye. In making his proposal he was as serious as 
was Swift, when he proposed to utilize the super- 
abundant babies of the poor by eating them. De- 
foe's pamphlet is an amusing exhibit of the fact 
that one can be entirely logical and entirely wrong 
at the same time, just as Whately, in his carefully 
elaborated document, demonstrated that no such 
person as Napoleon Bonaparte ever existed. 



A JOKE ON THE BRITISH NATION 19 

When Defoe's pamphlet appeared the wildest ex- 
citement arose. The dissenters were thrown into 
a panic and the high-fliers began to applaud it, es- 
pecially those in Cambridge and Oxford. He had 
exposed the real sentiments of the high-fliers and 
they were stupid enough to own up to it. Every 
one took it for genuine. The joke had to be ex- 
plained to the entire British public. When it was 
explained, a double storm broke on Defoe's head, 
so that he had to go into hiding. Both dissenters 
and high-fliers attacked him. The dissenters because 
of the fear he had inspired in them, the high-fliers 
because of the ridicule to which he had subjected 
them. 

The government took charge of the case and 
offered fifty pounds for Defoe's discovery. The 
description of the fugitive, which appeared in con- 
nection with this advertisement, is the only extant 
record of his personal appearance. It says, "He is 
a middle-sized, spare man, about forty years old, 
of a brown complexion and dark brown coloured 
hair; but wears a wig; a hooked nose, a sharp chin, 
and a large mole near his mouth : was born in Lon- 
don and is now owner of the brick and pantile works 
near Tilbury Fort in Essex." The portrait prefixed 
to his collected works faithfully reproduces the 
mole. Defoe felt as Lincoln did, when he said to 
his portrait-painter, "When you paint my portrait 
don't omit the wart." 

When the printer and bookseller of this remark- 



20 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

able pamphlet were arrested, then Defoe came out 
of hiding and gave himself up, so that they might 
not suffer on his behalf. His pamphlet was ordered 
to be burned by the "common hangman," and the 
punishment inflicted on Defoe himself was very 
heavy. He was sentenced to be imprisoned during 
the Queen's pleasure, to pay two hundred marks, 
and to find sureties of his good behaviour for seven 
years. Not only this, but he was condemned to 
stand in the pillory three times, before the Royal 
Exchange, at Cheapside and at Temple Bar. 

But, contrary to the gentle custom of the day, he 
received no insults or rotten eggs. Garlands of 
flowers decked the pillory and refreshments were 
brought to the victim. This personal triumph was 
achieved partly by a poem, which Defoe had written 
a few days before, called a "Hymn to the Pillory," 
published on the very day of his exposure and 
bought with enthusiasm by the crowd. Its spirit 
is shown in the familiar lines, 

Tell 'em the men that placed him here 

Are scandals to the times, 
Are at a loss to find his guilt 

And can't commit his crimes. 

Defoe's pluck had won the day, and turned his pun- 
ishment into a reflection upon those who had in- 
flicted it. 



CHAPTER IV 

JOURNALISM BORN IN A GAOL 

T T is of particular interest to modern journalism, 
- that during his imprisonment, Defoe did what 
perhaps no man before or after him has done: he 
originated, wrote and published a newspaper. It 
was called U A Review of the Affairs of France.'* 
It was a brilliant and graphic commentary on the 
political affairs of Europe, a dialogue between the 
imprisoned spectator of life and the busy world 
outside. The newspaper of that day was not like 
that of today, a huge sheet made up of paragraphs 
written by many anonymous persons. Defoe's 
paper at the start was limited to eight and then four 
small quarto pages but written entirely by himself, 
and he continued to write it three times a week for 
nine years, in the midst of a vast variety of political 
activities. 

This newspaper was the first of its kind. There 
were other news sheets at the time Defoe started 
his, but they were for the most part taken up with 
personal scandals. Defoe realized the popularity 
of this kind of news. He knew, he said, that people 
liked to be amused. He supplied this want in one 
section of his paper, under the title, "Advice from 

21 



22 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the Scandalous Club, being a weekly history of 
nonsense, impertinence, vice and debauchery." In 
contrasting Defoe's with a modern newspaper, it is 
to be observed that only a minor section of his 
paper was given up to such stuff, and further that 
the label boldly attached to this section was an 
honest warning to the reader as to what he may 
expect to find in it. 

It is interesting to note that from this section of 
Defoe's paper came to Richard Steele the first sug- 
gestion of the "Tatler," and from the 4< Tatler" 
came Addison's "Spectator." In the serious part 
of Defoe's paper, we have the foundation of Eng- 
lish journalism. It was as Defoe put it, the history 
of Europe written sheet by sheet and letting the 
world see it as it went on. We owe to him the 
inauguration of modern journalism which has played 
a critically important role in the modern world, an 
institution big with consequences both for good and 
evil, and which today constitutes the most complex 
and crucial of public problems in its bearing on the 
transportation of ideas and the moulding of public 
opinion. 

Thus did Defoe, as did Bunyan, Voltaire, and 
many more, transform the gaol into a hall of fame. 



CHAPTER V 

LYING LIKE THE TRUTH 

WHEN Defoe came out of prison, he found his 
fortunes ruined. But he had made a great 
discovery. He had paid a big price for it, but it 
was worth it. He had discovered a new literary 
method and the bent of his own genius. The stupid- 
ity of the public, which mistook his pamphlet for 
genuine, revealed to Defoe his capacity to play with 
perfect fidelity the part he had set himself. Thus 
he hit on the primary principle of modern fiction. 
He had learned to lie like the truth. As he himself 
said, "Lies are not worth a farthing if they are not 
calculated for the effectual deceiving of the people 
they are designed to deceive." He had deceived 
the whole country, and both political parties, by 
his pamphlet. He now saw that his true field was 
realistic fiction, so told that people will accept it 
as true. 

He made good use of his discovery. On April 
25, 1719, he produced "Robinson Crusoe." He 
was then fifty-eight years old. It frequently takes 
a man a long time to discover himself. The manu- 
script was offered to the whole round of the pub- 
lishing trade and refused, until one William Taylor 

23 



24 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

of the Ship, Paternoster Row, was induced to accept 
it. He became the most envied publisher of his 
day, for out of this single book he made his financial 
fortune. 

The greatness of a book may be measured by the 
criticism it receives. "Crusoe" was no exception to, 
this rule. As early as September of the year of its 
publication, bitter attacks were made upon it. 
Critics made merry over the trifling inconsistencies 
of the story. How, for example, they asked, could 
Crusoe have stuffed his pockets with biscuits, when 
he had taken off all his clothes before swimming to 
the wreck? How could he have been at such a 
loss for clothes, after those he had put off were 
washed away by the rising tide, when he had the 
ship's stores to choose from? How could he have 
seen the goat's eyes in the cave when it was pitch 
dark? How could the Spaniards give Friday's 
father an agreement in writing, when they had 
neither paper nor ink? How did Friday come to 
know so intimately the habits of bears, the bear 
not being a denizen of the West Indian Islands? 

Defoe yielded to this attack so far as to let his 
hero wear breeches in later editions. But such tri- 
fling criticisms are as wide of the mark as that of 
George Cruikshank, one of Crusoe's illustrators, 
who had become rabid in his teetotalism and ob- 
jected to the use of rum in the story. Dickens made 
a protest against introducing crotchets of any kind 
into fairyland, in his article in Household Words 



LYING LIKE THE TRUTH 25 

entitled "Frauds on the Fairies." "Imagine," he 
says, "a total abstinence edition of 'Robinson Crusoe' 
with the rum left out. Imagine a peace edition, 
with the gunpowder left out and the rum left in. 
Imagine a vegetarian edition, with the goats' flesh 
left out. Imagine a Kentucky edition to introduce 
a flogging of that 'tarnal nigger,' Friday, twice a 
week. Imagine an Aborigines Protection Society 
edition to deny the cannibalism and make Robinson 
embrace the amiable savages whenever they landed. 
'Robinson Crusoe' would be edited out of his island 
in a hundred years, and the island would be swal- 
lowed up in the editorial ocean a misfortune which 
happily has not yet come to pass." "Crusoe" as it 
stands needs no apology. 

The stock criticism, which has now settled down 
into a general impression is that Defoe stole his 
story from Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman from 
Largo, who was marooned for four years on the 
island of Juan Fernandez, which is off the coast 
of Chile, in South America. This impression was 
deepened by the poem, in which Cowper supposes 
Selkirk to record his feelings, and which begins with 
the well-known lines, 

I am monarch of all I survey, 

My right there is none to dispute. 

In the island of Juan Fernandez on the height, 
which Selkirk called his "look-out," two thousand 
feet above sea-level, a handsome tablet commemo- 



26 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

rates Selkirk, ana yet the island is called Crusoe's 
Island. Excursion boats are advertised to run to 
Crusoe's Island and post-cards, showing its natural 
features, all bear Crusoe's name. And yet the scene 
of Crusoe's exile was not laid in Juan Fernandez. 
Defoe's introduction distinctly says that the island 
was at the mouth of the great river Aroonoque and 
anyone who reads the book sees that Crusoe was 
going from the Brazils to Africa, when his boat 
was shipwrecked. 

The truth probably is, that Juan Fernandez, is 
the island which Defoe describes, but with a story- 
teller's license, he changed its location. For the 
long, low beach, the cave on the side of a rising 
hill, and the high lookout, are seen in the island 
today just as Defoe described them, and Robinson 
Crusoe is still the best guide to the island. It is 
now inhabited by ninety-three persons with an edu- 
cated European for governor, who is a citizen of 
Chile. Its one industry is a canning factory to 
preserve the codfish and lobsters with which the 
waters abound. 

There is no doubt that the germ of Defoe's book 
was suggested by Selkirk's experience. The story 
was told in Woodes Rogers' "Voyage Around the 
World" and occupied about the space of a news- 
paper column. Afterwards Richard Steele met Sel- 
kirk and described his adventure in the twenty-sixth 
number of the "Englishman." The story was com- 
mon property for several years. Anyone could 



LYING LIKE THE TRUTH 27 

have used the bare facts to build a story on, but 
nobody did, until the genius of Defoe created his 
great masterpiece. Defoe could not have stolen his 
Crusoe from Selkirk any more than a man could 
steal a silver dining service out of pewter plate.

CHAPTER VI 

THE FIRST MODERN NOVEL 

OBINSON CRUSOE" is a novel. It is a novel 
of incident. It is the first English novel, in >- 



distinction from the old romances. Defoe is the 
father of modern fiction. Brander Matthews re- 
marks that there are four stages in the development 
of fiction: "First from the Impossible to the Im- 
probable, thence to the Probable and finally to the 
Inevitable." Defoe ushered in the stage of the 
Probable. 

No book ever published was more extremely and 
immediately popular than Crusoe. A second edition 
was published May 12, a third on June 6, a spurious 
one on August 7, and a fifth on the following day. 
Five editions in four months is a rare achievement. 
It is one of the very few books that ever ran through 
a newspaper as a serial, after it had been published 
in book form. 

The same year of its publication it was translated 
into German and French. Since then it has been 
translated not only into every living language of 
Europe, but also into the classical languages of 
Greece and Rome. The traveler Burckhardt found 
it translated into Arabic and heard it read aloud 

28 



THE FIRST MODERN NOVEL 29 

among the wandering tribes in the cool of the eve- 
ning. I have seen editions of it both in Chinese and 
Japanese. In addition to its universai popularity, 
the influential impression it made on eminent men 
would form a suggestive chapter in the biography 
of the book. It occupied a prominent place in the 
little library that nourished Lincoln's mental life. 
For almost two hundred years it has been a living 
book and still is. There are in America alone today 
forty-seven different editions to be had, and to this 
large number the Houghton Mifflin Company re- 
cently thought it worth while to add a new and 
beautiful edition. A striking testimony to the in- 
fluence and popularity of "Robinson Crusoe" is the 
great number of books which have been written in 
imitation of it. There are too many to name. The 
best known of these imitations are, "Peter Wilkins," 
"Gulliver's Travels" and "Swiss Family Robin- 



son." 



Defoe wrote many other books. His output was 
over two hundred books in all, some of them of 
great merit. Some indeed think that his "Journal 
of the Great London Plague" is a better work of 
art than "Crusoe." His book on "Projects" also 
is a notable book, dealing with such subjects, 
as "Banks," "Insurance," "Stock-Gambling," and 
"Higher Education for Women." In it he was far 
in advance of his times and anticipated many future 
developments. Benjamin Franklin set a high value 
on this book. He said, "I found a work of Defoe's 



30 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

entitled 'An Essay on Projects,' from which per- 
haps I derived impressions that have since influenced 
some of the principal events of my life." 

However good these books are, it is as the author 
of "Robinson Crusoe" that Defoe is known. In the 
non-conformist burial ground at Bunhill Fields in 
London, where stand monuments to John Bunyan 
and Isaac Watts, there is also a monument to Defoe. 
On the flat stone, which formerly covered his grave, 
now stands a marble obelisk with this inscription: 

DANIEL DEFOE 

Born 1661 Died 1731 

Author of Robinson Crusoe 

This monument is the result of an appeal in the 
"Christian World" to the boys and girls of Eng- 
land for a fund to place a suitable monument on 
the grave of Daniel Defoe. It represents the 
united contributions of seventeen hundred persons, 
September, 1870. 



CHAPTER VII 

ROMANCE WITHOUT A LOVE STORY 

A BOOK, which occupies the place in the world's 
**- literature which "Robinson Crusoe" has oc- 
cupied for almost two hundred years and still re- 
tains, must hold a secret calculated to intrigue one's 
curiosity and challenge investigation. What is it? 
In searching for the secret of its popularity one is 
surprised to discover the absence of some elements, 
which he might naturally expect to find. The ele- 
ment of love, which plays so large a part in fiction 
as we have come to know it, is wholly absent from 
Crusoe. No modern novel and no film story would 
dare to risk the omission of a triangle love-complex, 
but Crusoe is a romance without any love story at 
all. You nowhere in it hear the consoling voice of 
woman or the prattle of little children. There is 
no poetic description of scenery. There is no pathos 
and no humor in it. "You remember," says Dick- 
ens, writing to his friend Forster, "my saying to 
you some time ago, how curious I thought it that 
'Robinson Crusoe' should be the only instance of an 
universally popular book, that could make no one 
laugh and could make no one cry." There is little 
else but a conscious choice of commonplaces and all 

31 



32 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

told in a simple matter-of-fact way. Its secret cer- 
tainly does not lie on the surface. 

Of course it is well written. It is well worth 
reading for its simple pure English alone. His 
"natural infirmity of homely plain writing," is the 
way Defoe humorously described it. The charm 
and force of simple idiomatic English is as apparent 
in Crusoe, as in "Pilgrim's Progress." This is 
doubtless where Defoe learned its use. If so, he 
learned his lesson well. It has been said that in 
conversation with any woman, if that conversation 
is two or three times renewed, you can tell whether 
she has read "Robinson Crusoe" or not by her 
skill in expressing herself well or her failure to 
do so. 

Its pure English is an attractive feature, but this 
does not, of course, account for its popularity. 
There is one feature of its composition however, 
which does account very largely for its charm. This) 
is its realism, using realism in its technical and be_st 
sense, as opposed to romanticism. It is the attempt 
to describe commonplace things, to depict things 
as they are, and to give them a new meaning and 
spiritual significance. 

It is Defoe's aim to produce the sense of reality / 
and illusion of truth. For this purpose he uses the 
best means to produce it, namely, current memoirs 
with the accompaniment of a diary. He says in 
the preface that he is only the editor of a private 
man's adventures, and then he adds confidentially 



ROMANCE WITHOUT A LOVE STORY 33 

that he believes the thing to be a just history of 
fact, u at least there is no appearance of fiction in 
it." He has written it so realistically that the fic- 
tion is hidden and the reader deceived. 

Defoe had a marvelous power of graphic detailed 
narrative. There is nothing on Crusoe's island, 
which we do not know and see as well as if we had 
dwelt on the island ourselves. Defoe's love of 
accurate, detailed description is indicated by the 
remark that Crusoe is the only novel in .which the 
characters get hungry three times a day. The story 
was immediately accepted as a true story of a real 
experience. It is still believed by many to be so. 
No child ever doubts its reality. It is a striking 
testimony to the life-likeness of Defoe's description 
that the invented story of Crusoe seems quite as 
probable as the real story of Selkirk. To grown 
men, Crusoe's island seems much more true and 
real than half of the actual islands they read about 
in history. We feel that Crusoe's experiences are, 
or could have been, our own, while we read them. 

Everything seems so natural and probable. A 
small boy once said to Edward Everett Hale, "I 
like 'Robinson Crusoe' because he doesn't succeed 
in everything. It is not, like most children's books, 
where the good boy makes everything come out 
right." This boy had an observing eye. For in- 
stance, Crusoe cannot make ink. It is long before 
he succeeds well in his pottery. He built a boat 
out of such heavy timber, and so far from the 



34 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

water, that he could not possibly launch it after it 
was built. He is constantly beginning things in the 
wrong way and has to work himself out the right 
way. He is not a prig. He is human. 

I once tested the naturalness of the story by 
reading it to a little ten-year old boy. He con- 
stantly interrupted the reading with questions, as to 
how certain situations came about, or why Crusoe 
did certain things the way he did. I often stopped 
to try to answer his questions, but always discovered 
that it was labor lost, because Defoe had anticipated 
every question that the little fellow asked, and 
answered it in the next paragraph, following the 
one which had raised the question in his mind. De- 
foe has a genius for circumstantial invention, which 
is the rarest of gifts. It means, as William Minto 
points out, that it was necessary that Crusoe's per- 
plexities should be unexpected and his expedients 
for meeting them unexpected; yet both perplexities 
and expedients were so life-like that when we were 
told them, we should wonder we had not thought 
of them before. 

This graphic, detailed description of the con- 
crete experience of a flesh and blood man is one of 
the great elements of power in the new literary 
method, which Defoe had discovered, and of which 
he was a master. It is this feature in Crusoe that 
holds the boy entranced with its pages. The ad- 
vantage of concreteness to a work of art may be 
illustrated by two little poems, both written on 



ROMANCE WITHOUT A LOVE STORY 35 

the battle of Culloden. One written by Collins for 
the English victors: 

How sleep the brave, who sink to rest 
By all their country's wishes blest! 
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold, 
Returns to deck their hallowed mold, 
She there shall dress a sweeter sod 
Than Fancy's feet have ever trod. 
By fairy hands their knell is rung, 
By forms unseen their dirge is sung; 
There Honor comes, a pilgrim gray, 
To bless the turf that wraps their clay, 
And freedom shall awhile repair, 
To dwell a weeping hermit there ! 

This is fine poetry, but the figures of speech used, 
although beautiful, are general and therefore they 
do not move us deeply. 

The other poem was written by Burns, for the 
vanquished Scotch: 

The lovely lass of Inverness, 

Nae joy nor pleasure can she see; 
From e'en and morn she cries, alas! 

And ay the saut tear blin's her e'e: 
Drumossie moor, Drumossie day 

A waefu' day it was to me! 
For there I lost my father dear, 

My father dear, and brethren three, 

Their winding-sheet the bluidy clay 
Their graves are growin' green to see, 

And by them lies the dearest lad 
That ever blest a woman's e'e. 



36 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

Now wae to thee, thou cruel lord, 

A bluidy man I trow thou be, 
For monie a heart thou has made sair 

That ne'er did wrang to thine or thee! 

This makes much the stronger appeal, because it 
states the case in terms of an individual lassie's heart 
and her actual sorrow. This same element of con- 
creteness is an outstanding characteristic of Crusoe 
and largely accounts for its fascination. Defoe's 
thought is not handicapped with artificial rhetoric, 
but is stated naked and unadorned. He wrote not 
language, but meaning. Unless he had acquired the 
rare habit of saying clearly what he meant, his 
book never would have become so popular with 
children who are embarrassingly honest in the de- 
mands they make on adults. But Defoe's art in 
realistic description is after all a question of method 
and it is not sufficient to account for the permanent 
favor which Crusoe has won in the world. 



CHAPTER VIII 

THE CHARM OF UNCERTAINTY 

T?OR the real secret of the book we must look 
-*- deeper. We must look for some fundamental 
and universal human interest, which it exhibits, and 
on the basis of which its appeal is made. 

Every great work of art is built upon and con- 
trolled by some one central idea, which becomes its 
organizing principle of life, and accounts for its 
vitality. Is there such a principle and, if so, what 
is it? The formative principle around which Crusoe 
was organized, is, I take it, the uncertainty of life. 
This is the dominating idea of the book. In the 
preface Defoe says, u The wonders of this man's 
life exceed all that is to be found extant; the life 
of one man being scarcely capable of a greater 
variety." It was the variety and uncertainty of his 
fortune, which Defoe regarded as the main feature 
of Crusoe's life. 

In the preface to the "Serious Reflections," he 
makes this still more clear. He says "I, Robinson 
Crusoe, being at this. time in perfect and sound mind 
and memory, thanks be to God therefor, do hereby 
declare that the story, though allegorical, is also 
historical; and that it is the beautiful representation 

37 



38 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

of a life of unexampled misfortunes, and of a va- 
riety not to be met with in the world, sincerely 
adapted to and intended for the common good of 
mankind." Defoe here clearly intimates that Cru- 
soe exhibited the dangers and vicissitudes of his own 
life. His own experience accounts for the striking 
sympathy, with which he followed the fortunes of 
his hero. There is in it an autobiographical note 
and this leads a man to speak from greater depth 
of feeling than any imaginary story could do. 

No principle is more calculated to make a univer- 
sal appeal than is the principle of uncertainty. 
"Leave the metaphysics of the question on the table 
for the present," says Van Dyke in his "Fisherman's 
Luck"; "as a matter of fact, it is plain that our 
human nature is adapted to conditions variable, 
undetermined, and hidden from our view. We are 
not fitted to live in a world where a + b always 
equals c, and there is nothing more to follow. The 
interest of life's equation arrives with the appear- 
ance of x, the unknown quantity. A settled, un- 
changeable, clearly foreseeable order of things does 
not suit our constitution. It tends to melancholy and 
a fatty heart. Creatures of habit we are undoubt- 
edly; but it is one of our most fixed habits to be 
fond of variety. The man, who is never surprised, 
does not know the taste of happiness, and unless the 
unexpected sometimes happens to us, we are most 
grievously disappointed. Much of the tediousness 
of highly civilized life comes from its smoothness 



THE CHARM OF UNCERTAINTY 39 

and regularity." "Robinson Crusoe" lives because 
it is organized on this principle, which is as broad 
and lasting as life itself, and because Defoe works 
it out like an artist. 



CHAPTER IX 

ROMANTICIZING THE COMMONPLACE 

I T is the principle of uncertainty, which roman- 
ticized the commonplace and gave charm to De- 
foe's description of it. The element of adventure 
makes commonplace things uncommon. Adventure 
is the charm for which all men are searching. 
Emerson says, "Man dreams of palaces and ends by 
building a woodshed." Very true, but only half 
the truth. Is it not worth while to build an honest 
woodshed? "Robinson Crusoe's" chief merit lies 
in its ability to make the building of a woodshed 
seem like a worth while and poetic performance. 
It is both original and commonplace. Defoe had 
the rare and great faculty to detect and depict the 
poetic elements in common life. In "Robinson 
Crusoe" Defoe made the same achievement which 
Thomas Gray made in his "Elegy Written in a 
Country Churchyard," that Dr. Johnson said em- 
bodied a sentiment never before expressed in liter- 
ature. 

A bill of particulars showing how the principle 
of uncertainty romanticizes the commonplace is read- 
ily furnished by Crusoe's experience. It is his un- 

40 



ROMANTICIZING THE COMMONPLACE 41 

certain and varying fortunes that give him a true 
perspective on the relative value of things. This 
is the distinguishing doctrine in his philosophy of 
life and appears repeatedly in the record of his 
adventures. 

It is exhibited, for example, in his soliloquy over 
the money he had taken from the ship and whose 
value had become zero in his island prison. He un- 
expectedly found himself in a situation in which 
money ceased to have any value. To him an orange 
was worth more than a twenty dollar gold piece and 
a few kind words would have been worth a score 
of twenty dollar gold pieces. He, therefore, was 
led to inquire, how much is money worth? How 
much is a man worth when he has lost all his money? 
The idea so stimulated him that he expressed him- 
self with fine scorn as he smiled at the money, "Oh, 
drug! What art thou good for? Thou art not 
worth to me no, not the taking off the ground; 
one of these knives is worth all this heap; I have 
no manner of use for thee; e'en remain where thou 
art, and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life 
is not worth saving." "However, upon second 
thoughts, I took it away." 

This is a prose poem, not on money, however, 
but on the discovery that apart from society, money 
has no value. In point of fact no constructive poem 
on money has ever been written and for good rea- 
son. It cannot be done. You can write a poem 
on real things like work, or love, or courage, or 



42 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

freedom. But money is not a real thing, it is only 
a symbol, an artificial social tool. Crusoe, through 
the memory of the worship commonly paid to this 
tool, was betrayed into almost spoiling his soliloquy 
by adding a touch of human weakness, relieved 
somewhat by its humor, "However, upon second 
thoughts, I took it away." 

The same principle is exhibited in the episode of 
saving the things from the wreck, which Crusoe 
sorely needed for his comfort. This is the most 
thrilling episode in the book, excepting the finding 
of the footprint on the sand. Through it he learned 
the value of common tools and supplies, because of 
the ever present possibility that they might be lost. 
The uncertainty of securing them from the ship, 
adds to their charm and value, as a recent writer 
expresses it, "Every kitchen tool becomes ideal, be- 
cause Crusoe might have dropped it in the sea." 

The social significance of this episode cannot be 
overstated. It is the dramatic statement of what 
is typical of the entire book and one of its chief 
contributions. The difficulty Crusoe had in mak- 
ing ink, in making a boat, in making cooking uten- 
sils, revealed to him their undiscovered value. The 
decisive part played in human evolution by the in- 
vention of tools is one of the big romances of 
history. Its value in human evolution is pointedly 
stated by Clarence Day, Jr., in his suggestive study 
of "This Simian World." He says: "A tool, in 
the most primitive sense, is any object, lying around, 



ROMANTICIZING THE COMMONPLACE 43 

that can obviously be used as an instrument for this 
or that purpose. Many creatures use objects as 
materials, as birds use twigs for nests. But the 
step that no animal takes is learning freely to use 
things as instruments. We ourselves, who are so 
good at it now, were slow enough in beginning. 
Think of the long epochs that passed before it en- 
tered our heads. The lesson to be learned was 
simple : the reward was the rule of a planet. Yet 
only one species, our own, has ever had that much 
brains." 

The power of mastery over nature added to the 
human hand, which itself is the best of tools, by the 
invention of other tools, cannot be calculated. We 
take for granted what it took slow and painful cen- 
turies of effort to produce. Centuries of discom- 
fort passed before we enjoyed a glass window in 
the house. The story of a house would be a thrill- 
ing story if it were written. Common tools would 
be romanticized for any one who comes to know 
their history. It is quite worth while to read "Rob- 
inson Crusoe" for this reason alone, because the 
best way to acquire a true perspective on the real 
value of things is to imagine them absent. 

The same principle is still more effectively ex- 
hibited by Crusoe's effort to stimulate in himself 
the feeling of gratitude. In order to comfort him- 
self, and have something to distinguish his case 
from a worse one, he set the good against the evil 
and stated it impartially, like debtor and creditor, 



44 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the comfort he enjoyed, against the miseries he 
suffered. For example: 



EVIL 

I am cast upon a horrible, 
desolate island; void of all 
hope of recovery. 

I am divided from man- 
kind, a solitary; one ban- 
ished from human society. 

I am without any defence, 
or means to resist any vio- 
lence of man or beast. 

I have no clothes to cover 
me. 



GOOD 

But I am alive; and not 
drowned, as all my ship's 
company was. 

But I am not starved, and 
perishing on a barren place, 
affording no substance. 

But I am cast on an island, 
where I see no wild beast to 
hurt me. 

But I am in a hot climate, 
where if I had clothes I 
could hardly wear them. 



"Thus I learned," he says, u to look on the bright 
side of my condition and consider what I enjoyed 
rather than what I wanted." Then follows one of 
those illuminating bits of philosophy, with which 
the reader of Crusoe is frequently rewarded: "All 
our discontent about what we want appeared to me 
to spring from the want of thankfulness for what 
we have." 

No finer statement of the philosophy of gratitude 
has ever been made. It ranks with Carlyle's, that 
"the fraction of life can be increased in value not 
so much by increasing your numerator as by lessen- 
ing your denominator." Crusoe demonstrated Car- 
lyle's contention that happiness grows not by increas- 



ROMANTICIZING THE COMMONPLACE 45 

ing one's desires, but by decreasing one's wants. 
It is a question of the relative value of the things 
one has and the things one wants. A man, who 
through the adventure of uncertainty, acquires the 
capacity to distinguish between the big and the little, 
and the courage to act on this knowledge, is in a 
fair way to become every inch a man. 



CHAPTER X 

EVERY INCH A MAN 

'TpHAT is what happened to Crusoe; that is how 
* it happened, and that is the reason why the 
world fell in love with this open-minded manly 
mariner of York. He is not a man given to the 
"luxury of grieving." He does not stand and cry. 
He spends no time bemoaning his misfortunes. 
Had he given himself up to self-pity, he would have 
been ruined. Of course, he was not without fear 
and discouragement. But this is nothing against 
his courage, but rather in its favor. For there could 
be no courage if fear were not present. Courage 
does not mean the absence of fear, but the conquest 
of it. The absence of emotion and sentiment in the 
book only serves to heighten the effect of Crusoe's 
courage. 

It is the indomitable courage of the man under 
desperate circumstances, which is the first thing that 
charms us in reading the book. He faces the future 
without guarantees of any kind, and this is the 
essence of courage. He is not the type of man who 
consults fortune-tellers to pry into his future. He 
understands to begin with, that they know nothing 

46 



EVERY INCH A MAN 47 

whatever about his future. He also understands 
that even if they did, it would damage him if they 
told him. If it were possible for a man to know 
his future, that knowledge would at once transform 
his future into a past and paralyze his will for pres- 
ent achievement. This is why Dante in his "In- 
ferno" punishes fortune-tellers by twisting their 
heads squarely around on their bodies, so that as 
they walk forward they look backward. That is 
the poet's picturesque way of saying that a man 
who knows his future has no future but only a past 
and incapacitates himself for making effective prog- 
ress in the present. Crusoe is typically Anglo-Saxon 
in his patient acceptance of fate, and his effort to 
make the best of it. Crusoe's gospel is the same 
as that of Kipling. It is the gospel of work and 
the gospel of courage. He faces heat, cold, hard- 
ship, sickness and peril, which would have shattered 
the mind of any man of less sturdy fiber, but which 
leave him unshaken and unafraid, ready always for 
the next duty, which lies at hand- 

His courage led him to take the world "as is"; 
not to run away from it, but come to grips with it. 
He blames no one but himself; a rare habit. Usu- 
ally when a man succeeds he takes the credit to 
himself; when he fails, he puts the blame on Others. 
Crusoe blamed himself for his failure and thereby 
discovered both its cause and cure. He does not 
face dangers with a grumble, but with an honest 
smile. When it was reported to Carlyle that Mar- 



48 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

garet Fuller said she had decided to accept the 
universe, the great Scotchman remarked, "Gad, she 
better." Crusoe accepted the universe, not in a 
spirit of weak acquiescence with it, but because he 
knew that this attitude is the secret of progress as 
well as of personal happiness, for if you want to 
get anywhere you have to start from where you are. 
There are plenty of things to find fault with, espe- 
cially if a man begins with himself, but to face life 
in the protesting attitude is weakness. To be so 
enamored with a perfect condition of things, that 
one can neither enjoy nor co-operate with the pres- 
ent imperfect one, is a malady Crusoe did not have. 
He saw the wisdom of making honorable compro- 
mise with the world, and then trying to re-fashion 
it as best he could with patience and good humor. 
This is the key to a correct analysis of Crusoe's 
character, and explains the universal verdict of 
admiration for him. His courage constitutes one 
of the chief grounds of the book's appeal, for it is 
an appeal to a fundamental instinct in all men. 
However much or little of courage a man may him- 
self possess, he always admires it in others. There 
is doubtless no character in fiction more than Crusoe, 
who has a better right to quote the great lines of 
Henley, as descriptive of his own mental attitude: 

Out of the night that covers me, 
Black as the pit from pole to pole, 

I thank whatever gods may be 
For my unconquerable soul. 



EVERY INCH A MAN 49 

In the fell clutch of circumstance 
I have not winced nor cried aloud. 

Beneath the bludgeonings of chance 
My head is bloody but unbow'd. 

Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
Looms but the Horror of the shade, 

And yet the menace of the years 
Finds and shall find me unafraid. 

It matters not how strait the gate, 

How charged with punishments the scroll, 

I am the master of my fate: 
I am the captain of my soul. 

It is this conscious attitude of courage, which 
equipped Crusoe to capitalize his experience and 
acquire internal resources. It is the vast fertility 
of resource, developed in him by his brave effort to 
meet the difficulties of his uncertain fortunes, which 
constitute the biggest by-product of his experience, 
and, as sometimes happens, it is more valuable than 
the main product. His perplexities were very vari- 
ous. The expedients he devised for meeting them 
developed him into a self-reliant sturdy, all-round 
man. He was sailor, farmer, mechanic, hunter, 
cook, business man and philosopher all in one. 

This is Robinson Crusoe, the type of man he 
was, and the secret of his popularity. The kind of 
life Crusoe led, with its effect on Crusoe himself, is 
rich in meaning and challenge for our day, because 
of its contrast to present social and economic con- 



50 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

ditions. Very frequently I have tested the men in 
my city audiences by asking the question : How many 
men in this audience do now, or have in the past, 
harbored the secret desire to quit your city life, 
acquire a farm and lead a free and self-sufficient 
existence? Invariably over ninety per cent of the 
men raise their hands. "Robinson Crusoe" enables 
them to indulge this desire vicariously and this ex- 
plains why new editions of the book continue to 
come from the press. It is the unique expression 
of an irrepressible instinct which all normal men 
feel, and most men have throttled, the instinct urg- 
ing a man to reject the restraints and complexities 
of civilization and seek a mode of life natural and 
true. When this instinct surges up sufficiently to 
disturb his acquired peace of mind, he reads a book 
like Carpenter's "Civilization, Its Cause and Cure," 
and then he resigns himself to his fate with the 
remark, "What's the use?" 

Crusoe thus raises an inescapable question. He 
represents the type of man produced in England 
previous to the English Industrial Revolution; what 
type of man are modern industrial conditions pro- 
ducing, and how can industry be so organized as 
to prevent the denaturization of a worker's man- 
hood? The meaning of Crusoe's challenge to civili- 
zation is the subject for consideration in the next 
Part. 



PART II 

ROBINSON CRUSOE'S CHALLENGE TO 
MODERN INDUSTRY 



Yards of cotton, tons of coal, ingots of metal are not 
measures of civilization. Men and women ARE, and if 
you tell me the method we are about introducing, or hoping 
to introduce, would strike down capital to one-half of the 
amount employed today, but would lift men and women of 
Massachusetts forty per cent, above their present level, 1 
would say all hail to this change. This is a true civilization. 

WENDELL PHILLIPS. 



PART II 

ROBINSON CRUSOE'S CHALLENGE TO 
MODERN INDUSTRY 



CHAPTER I 

GREATNESS UNAWARES 

A MONG the few men who have appreciated the 
* contribution of an indispensable and disre- 
garded element, which "Robinson Crusoe" makes 
to the serious study of economics, was Frederic 
Harrison, who said of the book: " 'Robinson Cru- 
soe,' which is a fairy tale to the child, a book of 
adventure to the young, is a work on social philos- 
ophy to the mature. It is a picture of civilization. 
The essential moral attributes of man, his innate 
impulses as a social being, his absolute dependence 
on society, even as a solitary individual, his subjec- 
tion to the physical world, and his alliance with the 
animal world, the statical elements of social phi- 
losophy, and the germs of man's historical evolution 
have never been touched with more sagacity, and, 
assuredly, have never been idealized with such magi- 
cal simplicity and truth." 

53 



54 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

It is, of course, not to be supposed that Defoe 
Consciously aimed to write a book on sociology, and 
Mr. Harrison did not intend to convey this impres- 
sion. But it frequently happens that the author of 
a great work of art will say more to succeeding 
generations than to his own, not because others read 
new meaning into it, but because new conditions 
invest it with new significance. So it has happened 
to "Robinson Crusoe." The book has acquired 
new greatness unawares. It enjoys the unearned 
increment of a fresh greatness, acquired by subse- 
quent industrial events, which it did not anticipate 
but which it challenges. The fact that its contribu- 
tion to sociology is unconscious gives it enhanced 
value. It is not Defoe, who challenges modern in- 
dustry; it is "Robinson Crusoe." The challenge 
lies in the fact itself, for which he stands. The 
book taken by itself, as Mr. Harrison suggests, has 
a profound meaning for sociology, because it iso- 
lates the basic elements of society, and dramatically 
portrays their significance. But when the book is 
read in the light of what has happened since it was 
written, its enlarged meaning seems like a new and 
fresh discovery. 

What happened since it was written, and made 
this work of art to be also a big human story with 
a challenge, is The Industrial Revolution. Crusoe 
is the typical human product of industrial conditions 
in England previous to this revolution. No thought- 
ful man today can read the book without comparing 



GREATNESS UNAWARES 55 

Crusoe to the type of man produced by modern 
industry. Herein lies its challenge. If we place"" 
Ruth's sickle along side of a McCormick reaper, it 
is quite obvious that we have made very commend- 
able progress indeed in this line of manufacture; 
but if we stand Ruth herself beside the young women 
who attended the modern reaper in a recent world's 
fair, is it at all obvious that we have made any 
progress in this line of manufacture? And yet the 
making of men is the mission of modern democ- 
racies and the acid test of their success. Crusoe's 
challenge concerns the human factor in industry, 
which is its heart. 



CHAPTER II 

CRUSOE AS A RIP VAN WINKLE 

/^"RUSOE was marooned on his island twenty- 
^^ eight years, and absent from England thirty- 
five. It is not without significance that Crusoe 
landed on this island in September 1659, the month 
in which the English Commonwealth ended, and 
returned to England in June 1687, the month in 
which the Convention Parliament met to establish 
William III. It is the exact period during which 
the second Stuart reign defiled the English Govern- 
ment, and during which Crusoe, had he been free 
to choose, would have preferred to be absent, set- 
ting up a country of his own, in which he was king 
over himself. 

When Crusoe returned to England after his en- 
forced absence, as he is represented as doing, he 
found things in the nation, apart from the Govern- 
ment, just about as he had left them. His home- 
coming occasioned no shock or thrill except as his 
personal feelings were stirred by his effort to dis- 
cover whether his parents were still alive and by 
his joy in revisiting the scenes of his childhood. 
The social and industrial conditions continued un- 
changed. There are many short and some long 

56 



CRUSOE AS A RIP VAN WINKLE 57 

periods of history, in which society has remained 
static, because human nature, left to itself, resists 
change. To such periods one may apply the open- 
ing remark of Mark Twain in his commencement 
address on "Methuselah," to the effect that, "Me- 
thuselah lived to be 969 years old, but he might as 
well have lived to be a thousand years old, because 
nothing was doing." 

But if Crusoe had been a Rip Van Winkle and 
returned to England one hundred years after his 
story was written in 1719, he would have been as 
shocked as though he had emigrated to another 
planet. He would have discovered that the Eng- 
land of his boyhood had ceased to exist, except in 
his memory, that in its place had arisen a new Eng- 
land, more changed than it had been during many 
previous centuries. 

During the last half of the century of Crusoe's 
supposed absence, there occurred two revolutions, 
more influential than any in human history and big 
with consequences for human welfare. The first 
of these revolutions was political. It is called the 
American Revolutionary War. It opened a new 
road to freedom and inaugurated the greatest ex- 
periment in democracy on a large scale, which had 
yet been tried. It was the brave assertion of an 
equality of opportunity for the self-development of 
all men. It had its beginning in a band of courag- 
eous pioneers who, a little more than a hundred 
and fifty years previously, had adventured into a 



58 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

newly discovered continent to establish "a govern- 
ment without a king and a church without a prelate/ 1 
but the movement fruited into fact in the Revolution. 
It was a boon not only to America, but to England 
also and to all mankind as well, the significance of 
which is still an unfinished story. 

Its inner meaning for modern industry is criti- 
cally important and has never been more accurately 
stated than in the brief, dynamic words, uttered by 
President Lincoln, in our most sacred building, the 
plain brick building in Philadelphia, in which the 
Republic was born. "I have often pondered,' 1 
said our typical American, "over the dangers which 
were incurred by the men who assembled here, and 
who formed and adopted the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence. I have pondered over the toils of the 
officers and soldiers who achieved that independence. 
I have often inquired of myself what great principle 
or idea it was that kept this confederacy so long 
together. It was not the mere matter of the sepa- 
ration of the colonies from the motherland, but that 
sentiment in the Declaration, which gave promise 
that in due time the weight would be lifted from the 
shoulders of all men.' 1 The same sentiment which 
six months later he thus expressed: "This is essen- 
tially a people's contest . . . for maintaining in the 
world that form and substance of government whose 
leading objects is to elevate the condition of men, 
to lift artificial weights from all shoulders, to clear 
the paths of laudable pursuits for all, to afford all 



CRUSOE AS A RIP VAN WINKLE 59 

an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of 
life." 

Simultaneously with this Revolution, occurred an- 
other far less dramatic, but far more drastic in its 
effect on the modern world. It is u the industrial 
revolution," which is still in progress. It was an 
astounding triumph of science and invention and 
produced a swift transformation in the whole aspect 
of the modern world. Its real significance is as yet 
only slightly appreciated. Lothrop Stoddard merely 
states the plain facts when he says: "This trans- 
formation was, indeed, absolutely unprecedented in 
the world's history. Hitherto man's material prog- 
ress had been a gradual evolution. With the excep- 
tion of gunpowder, he had tapped no new sources 
of material energy since very ancient times. The 
horse-drawn mail-coach of our great-grandfathers 
was merely a logical elaboration of the horse-drawn 
Egyptian chariot; the wind-driven clipper-ship 
traced its line unbroken to Ulysses's lateen bark 
before Troy; while industry still relied on the brawn 
of man and beast or upon the simple action of wind 
and waterfall. Suddenly all was changed. Steam, 
electricity, petrol and Hertzian wave, harnessed 
Nature's hidden powers, conquered distance, and 
shrunk the terrestrial globe to the measure of human 
hands. Man entered a new material world, differ- 
ing not merely in degree but in kind from that of 
previous generations." 

After Crusoe saw what had happened, he no 



60 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

doubt had the impulse, in his role as Rip Van 
Winkle, to take the next boat back to his uninhab- 
ited island, for with these two revolutions there 
arose also a fierce controversy whose end is not yet. 
The two revolutions stood for ideals diametrically 
opposed. The Revolutionary War changed tKe 
political status of man from that of a servant to 
that of a freeman. The industrial revolution 
changed his status from that of a freeman to that 
of a slave. It inaugurated an irrepressible conflict. 
The debate is not less but more alive than ever 
before and will not end until a reconciling principle 
is discovered and put into operation. Nothing is 
ever settled until it is settled right. The principle 
on which it can be settled right we are on the verge 
of discovering, although we are unexcusably late in 
doing so. To state this discovery is the aim of this 
book. 



CHAPTER III 

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 

T OOKED at in the large, the industrial revolu- 
** tion seems to have occurred swiftly and all at 
once. It did occur more suddenly than any other 
big event of its kind. But nothing is wholly uncon- 
nected with the past or unrelated to the future. The 
principle of Emerson's great poem, "Each and All," 
may be accepted as a universal law : 

All are needed by each one ; 
Nothing is fair or good alone. 

The industrial revolution was no exception to 
this law. Every event, like every man, has a past. 
In the year that Crusoe was written, 1719, the first 
factory in the modern sense was started. That is, 
a factory in which the motive power was supplied 
from outside, human fingers were replaced by 
machinery, and men worked exclusively for wages. 
It was the silk "throwing mill," erected by the 
Lombe Brothers in Derbyshire. The name implies 
that it was imported from Italy, as it was. How 
John Lombe, at the risk of his life, stole the knowl- 
edge of the new machinery, is a thrilling and typical 
chapter in the pioneer story of the factory system. 

61 



62 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

This was one among several heralds of the com- 
ing change. But the real beginning of the industrial 
revolution, the thing which gave to England her 
nickname "the workshop of the world," occurred 
and became effective fifty years later, around the 
period of the American Revolutionary War. It 
centers in particular about the inventions of four 
men: Kay, Hargreaves, Cartwright and Watt. 

John Kay invented a new shuttle for the loom. 
It was mechanically propelled, reducing the weaver's 
labor and doubling his output. It made possible 
the weaving of cloth wider than the distance between 
the outstretched arms of one operator. It not only 
dispensed with one worker at the loom, but enabled 
one weaver to handle the material supplied by six 
spinners. By Kay's invention, as Carlyle expressed 
it: '"The shuttle drops from the fingers of the 
weaver and falls into iron hands that ply it faster." 

James Hargreaves invented a new spinning 
wheel and, in honor of his wife, named it the "spin- 
ning-jenny." She deserved it. He was a poor 
weaver and while waiting for a supply of weft from 
his wife's one-thread wheel an accident occurred. 
Her machine was suddenly thrown into an upright 
position, but wheel and spindle did not cease to 
revolve. This flashed on his mind the possibility 
of driving several spindles with one wheel. He at 
once contrived a machine, which produced the same 
amount of yarn in the same time as had hith- 
erto been furnished by eight machines. His sense 



THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 63 

of humor and fair play supplied the nickname, 
"spinning-jenny." This invention was built on the 
previous invention of John Wyatt, who made a 
machine able to spin a thread of cotton for the 
first time unaided by human fingers. It was in turn 
built on and improved by Richard Arkwright, a 
barber, whose machine produced yarn of greater 
strength; and also by Samuel Crompton a poor 
weaver, whose "spinning mule" produced yarn of 
finer quality, which could be made into materials 
like muslin. 

Edward Cartwright, a country clergyman, in- 
vented the power loom, which was not patented. 
He believed in the free use of ideas. The weaving 
process had been six times faster than the spinning 
process. But Hargreaves' invention reversed this 
order and made weaving to be the lagger. It was 
now necessary to increase the speed of weaving. 
The alluring principle of "keeping up with Lizzie" 
applies to machines as well as to people. The re- 
quired speed was supplied by Cartwright's power 
loom, which made possible the use of horses and 
of running water. 

James Watt, the son of a shipwright, invented 
the double-acting steam engine. He first discovered 
that steam could be used to work a pump. But in 
the engine at first contrived, only the upward stroke 
of the piston was acted on by the steam. Watt then 
made his marvelous invention of a double-acting 
engine, in which the steam that forced the piston 



64 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

up was condensed, and another jet of steam forced 
the piston down. Watt's genius more than met the 
indispensable need for mechanical power. England 
went "steam-mill mad." Boulton, Watt's rich part- 
ner, who characteristically took the lion's share of 
the profits, remarked to King George III : "I sell, 
Sire, what all the world desires power." 

It will be observed that these inventions were 
made by workingmen, not by bankers. They came 
not from the financial but from the engineering de- 
partment of industry, a fact highly significant when 
we come to consider the demand of workingmen for 
an opportunity to use their initiative and play a 
larger part in their own enterprise. The spiritual 
contribution, both for good and evil, made by 
mechanical inventions to the evolution of society and 
the progress of democracy is a story which never 
yet has been told effectively. 

Watt soon contrived steam-engines capable of 
operating all kinds of machines and in 1785, about 
the close of the American Revolutionary War, steam 
was used to drive the machinery of a cotton factory. 
It was the application of steam to machinery, which 
in real fashion inaugurated the industrial revolution, 
whose second and great period, roughly speaking, 
ran from 1762 to 1840. It swiftly transformed 
the face of things. 

The five decisive inventions, which have contrib- 
uted most to the creation of modern civilization are 
the compass, lens, gunpowder, printing press and 



THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION 65 

steam engine. These are the big five, the giants 
which have revolutionized the social life of the 
world, but the most potent, both for good and evil, 
is the steam engine. 

The advantages of the revolution were obvious. 
Machinery lowered the price of manufactured 
goods. It made comforts possible for the many, 
which once were the privilege of the few. It made 
the necessities of life cheaper, provided one had 
the means to purchase them. It increased the wages 
of labor. It developed a higher degree of skill of 
a certain type, because machinery can act, but can- 
not think. Modern machinery is not the triumph 
of matter, but the triumph of mind. 

The disadvantages of the revolution were equally 
obvious and in some respects much greater. The 
machine compelled people to settle around it. It 
created the modern city. It spoiled the beautiful 
landscapes of England by its ugly, brutalizing build- 
ings. It crowded the workers into factory towns 
and increased the diseases that come through crowd- 
ing. It lengthened the hours of labor. It made 
goods so fast that it glutted the market and created 
a new kind of famine, the famine for work. 
Whately Cooke Taylor says: "It vulgarizes the 
product, it stultifies the workman, it deteriorates 
public taste." If this statement is true, the 
machine's chief gospel seems to be the gospel of 
cheapness. It is a challenging paradox that machi- 
nery multiplied wealth enormously and at the same 



66 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

time multiplied poverty. From 1760 to 1818 the 
population of England increased 70 per cent, and 
the poor relief increased five hundred thirty per 
cent. Wealth and pauperism grew side by side. 
The system of producing wealth had been greatly 
changed; the system of its distribution had not. It 
is not difficult to understand why a good and great 
man like John Stuart Mill, who saw and studied the 
industrial revolution at first hand, could go so far 
as to say: "It is questionable, if all the mechanical 
inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of 
any human being." Sad, indeed, if true; still sad- 
der if it is permitted to remain true. Was not 
machinery designed to harness the powers of Nature 
for the purpose of relieving man of back-breaking 
toil? 



CHAPTER IV 

THE DESERTED VILLAGE 

1T7HEN Crusoe left England as a youth, seeking 
adventure, the prevailing type of manufacture 
was the system of cottage industry. It was chiefly 
handicraft, stimulating the worker's initiative and 
expressing his personality. It was free, each mem- 
ber of the household being at liberty to play what 
part in industry he liked. It was self-respecting, 
the workers associating with each other as equals, 
joined by bonds of affection and tradition rather 
than by bonds whose responsibility was limited to 
barter and exchange. It was production guided by 
the family spirit, production first for use; second 
for profit. 

At this period the work was entirely domestic and 
its different branches widely scattered. As described 
by Mr. James, the manufacturer traveled on horse- 
back to secure raw material among the farmers. It 
was distributed to sorters, then to combers, and 
then taken into the country to be spun. Here at 
each village he had his agents, who received the 
wool, distributed it among the peasantry, and re- 
ceived it back as yarn. The machine employed was 
still the old one-thread wheel and in summer weather 

67 



\ 



63 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

on many a village green might be seen the house- 
wives plying their busy trade, and furnishing to the 
poet the vision of Contentment spinning at the cot- 
tage door. 

It is a pleasant picture. One feature of it is 
interestingly described by Defoe in his "Tour of 
England." "The land near Halifax," he says, "was 
divided into small enclosures, from two acres to six 
or seven each, seldom more. Every three or four 
pieces of land had a house belonging to them . . . 
hardly a house standing out of a speaking distance 
from another. . . . We could see at every house 
a tenter, and on almost every tenter a piece of cloth. 
. . . At every considerable house was a manufac- 
tory. . . . Every clothier keeps one horse at least 
to carry his manufactures to the market; and gen- 
erally a cow or two for his family. . . . The houses 
are full of lusty fellows, some at the dye-vat, some 
at the looms, others dressing the cloths; the women 
and children carding and spinning, being all em- 
ployed from the youngest to the oldest. . . . Not 
a beggar to be seen, nor an idle person." 

Another feature of this picture is described by 
Thorold Rogers in his "Six Centuries of Work and 
Wages." "Each master of a handicraft, with his 
family and a few apprentices and journeymen about 
him, plied his trade in his home, owner of his simple 
tools and master of his profits. His workmen ate 
at his table, married his daughters, and hoped to 
become masters themselves when their time of edu- 



THE DESERTED VILLAGE 69 

cation was over. He worked for customers whom 
he knew and honest work was good policy. He 
supplied a definite demand. The rules of his guild 
and the laws of his city barred out alien or reckless 
competition which would undermine his trade. So 
men lived simply and rudely. They had no hope of 
millions to lure them, nor the fear of poverty to \ 
haunt them. They lacked many of the luxuries 
accessible even to the poor today, but they had a 
large degree of security, independence and hope. 
And man liveth not by cake alone." 

Had Crusoe returned to England as Rip Van 
Winkle, he would have discovered that the domestic 
system had been destroyed by its deadly enemy, the 
capitalistic form of production. Cottage industry 
was gone. The factory system replaced it. The 
village was coming to be the deserted village. The 
farm laborer was ''divorced from the soil," as well 
as the factory worker from his work. Status was 
changed to contract, and personal relations were 
replaced by "business" relations. The workman's 
personal interest in his work was killed. Whole 
classes of laborers, both in agriculture and manu- 
facture were thrown out of work by the new machine 
industry. The factory system spread everywhere, 
and with it spread dissatisfaction. 

The change from the old system to the new was 
bitterly resisted. The new inventions which made 
the factory system possible were savagely attacked 
and the machines destroyed. Kay, the inventor of 



70 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the new shuttle, was mobbed and his life threatened. 
He was driven from England to France, where he 
died in poverty. Hargreaves, the inventor of the 
spinning-jenny, was driven from his native town, 
and wherever the jenny was used serious riots oc- 
curred. So common became the destruction of 
machinery that Parliament passed a law fixing the 
death penalty as the punishment for its destruction. 
This action of the workmen seems stupid. They, 
like the rest of us, sometimes do stupid things. 
That the invention of machinery, which would vastly 
multiply wealth, make comforts available for all, 
and lift the burden of back-breaking toil, should 
have been greeted with bitter destructive protest 
instead of being hailed with celebrations of joy, is 
an appalling and puzzling fact. It is an indictment 
against society's intelligence. But so far as the 
workmen were concerned, their stupidity is only 
apparent. 

For the workman's action there's a reason. Bene- 
/ fits of the new machines went first to the owner and 
<y then to the consumer, but the unemployed wage- 
laborer is not embraced in either class. Hungry 
stomachs sometimes do not think, but sometimes 
they do. The issue is much more profound than 
the surface facts would indicate. Workmen in- 
stinctively and clearly perceived the meaning of the 
change. They were fighting against the degrada- 
^ tion of their position from that of a self-supporting 
to that of a wage-earning class. They wanted to 



THE DESERTED VILLAGE 71 

preserve their status as free men, the chance to use 
their initiative, the joy that comes from personal 
relation to their work and among fellow workers. 
They would have been willing to use machinery as 
an aid to their labor, but they protested against 
becoming slaves to the machinery. In the old system 
the human element was supreme; in the new the 
machine was supreme. Their bitter protest was, 
therefore, not merely to the economic damage done 
by the new factory system, but to the domestic, 
moral, and intellectual damage as well. They re- 
belled against being converted from men into 
"hands." They wanted to be the kind of man 
Crusoe was, a man capable of writing a journal, 
and engaged in the kind of work worth writing 
about. 

The same kind of emphatic protest, which greeted 
the introduction of the factory system into England, 
is today greeting its introduction into India. Under 
the leadership of the saintly Gandhi, ten million of 
his followers have organized the non-cooperation 
movement, whose central policy is non-violence. 
This is only incidentally a political movement to 
secure self-government. At heart it is an organized 
protest against Western civilization. The flag of 
the movement, very significantly, is a spinning wheel 
on a background of red, white and green. This 
is the symbolic expression of the people's conviction 
that the modern factory is a menace. They are 
urged to boycott foreign cloth and erect a spindle 



72 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

in each home. Incessant bonfires of foreign cloth 
have marked the movement, not because they are 
opposed to new ideas, but opposed to Western civili- 
zation on fundamental and to them rational grounds. 
That our industrial civilization, which we have pain- 
fully created, is thus resisted as an evil instead of 
welcomed as a blessing is disturbing to Western 
pride. It will do no good to attempt to force 
machine-made cloth on people who for spiritual 
reasons prefer to make it with their own hands. 
The challenge will be more wisely met if we inquire 
whether our industrial system is as good as we had 
supposed it to be and whether it may not need some 
reconstruction. 

The damage to society and to manhood from 
the new factory system is effectively described by 
the genius of Oliver Goldsmith in his "Deserted 
Village. " The workmen no doubt chiefly resisted 
a damage to themselves, but Goldsmith makes it 
clear that the damage went deeper, and was a pro- 
found concern not to workmen only, but to the whole 
nation, for 

111 fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, 
Where wealth accumulates, and men decay: 
Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade 
A breath can make them, as a breath has made; 
But a bold peasantry, their country's pride, 
When once destroy'd can never be supplied. 



CHAPTER V 

THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN 

/ TT V HE factory system was affected profoundly, 
-* and injuriously by two notable events, which 
riot only blocked reform, but also opened the door 
to frightful evils. One was the French Revolution. 
Alarm at its results led factory owners to attribute 
a sinister political motive to the most innocent de- 
mand for reform. The other was the publication 
of Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations," issued in 
the year that the American Revolutionary War be- 
gan. A book may be as big with consequences as 
a battle. This book was far bigger. It was itself 
a decisive battle of the first order. 

This book won the battle for economic freedom 
and created the science of political economy. Its 
author fought and won the courageous fight for 
economic freedom from the pernicious and intol- 
erable restraints imposed by the middle ages on 
industry, agriculture, and commerce. It was a serv- 
ice of the utmost historical significance. Adam 
Smith won the battle against tyranny by exhaus- 
tively demonstrating that social harmony and the 
most benefit for all could be secured through eco- 
nomic freedom. 

73 



74 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

But Adam Smith was far too clear a thinker to 
suppose that social harmony ever could be achieved 
through unchecked freedom. While the burning 
cause of his life was freedom, he makes it clear that 
exceptions and limitations to freedom must be in- 
cluded as part of his doctrine. He did not mean 
freedom to do as one pleases, but freedom to do 
good. Long before he wrote his book, he exhibited 
in practice the kind of freedom he meant. While a 
professor in a university, the corporation of Smiths 
at Glasgow prevented James Watt from exercising 
his trade. Adam Smith came to the rescue of the 
great inventor and secured him the right to carry 
on his work in one of the buildings of the university. 

Smith's aim was to destroy the slavery of the 
dark ages, not to institute a new slavery. But a 
new slavery, ironically enough, was the outcome of 
his teaching. "Practical" men took his dominating 
idea, divorced it from its qualifying principles and 
made of it a rule of conduct. His doctrine of eco- 
nomic freedom was transformed into the go-as-you- 
please policy. It is quite obvious that whenever 
there is inequality of condition, unrestrained per- 
sonal freedom means one thing and one thing only 
the exploitation of the weak by the strong. This 
is what happened. Manufacturers eager to secure 
cheap and docile labor, filled their shops with chil- 
dren subjecting them to the most brutal severity. 

The acid test of unlimited economic freedom and 
the heart of the challenge against modern industry, 



THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN 75 

is best exhibited by its treatment of defenseless little 
children, who constitute a nation's biggest, but as yet 
unrecognized, asset. It is not a pleasant subject to 
illustrate in detail, but it is essential for clarity in 
stating the challenge we propose to face honestly. 
The illustration is taken from the "Memoir of 
Robert Blincoe," written by a Mr. Brown after a 
careful investigation of the effect of the factory 
system on health and morals, and narrated in Tay- 
lor's "Modern Factory System." It is true the 
condition he describes existed prior to the writing 
of Adam Smith's book. Crimes against children 
have never been confined to any one period. But 
the story of Robert Blincoe exhibits the logical and 
actual results, whenever economic freedom is un- 
restrained : 

"Robert Blincoe was an orphan. When seven, 
he was apprenticed for a term of fourteen years to 
serve at a cotton mill near Nottingham, whither he 
was sent with a large number of other children, male 
and female, about eighty in all. The story tells 
of the ridiculous hopes purposely fostered in their 
minds and the treatment they should receive there, 
and of the fearful awakening that followed. 'It 
was gravely stated to them that they were all when 
they arrived at the cotton mill to be transformed 
into ladies and gentlemen; that they would be fed 
on roast beef and plum pudding be allowed to ride 
their master's horses and have silver watches, and 
plenty of cash in their pockets/ Alas, for these 



76 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

bright young dreams. We are particularly in- 
formed that Blincoe was not treated in this mill 
'with that sanguinary and murderous ferocity' that 
he experienced in others, but, nevertheless, 'from 
morning till night he was continually being beaten, 
pulled by the hair of his head, kicked or cursed, as 
were the other children. . . . Being too short of 
stature to reach to his work standing on the floor, 
he was placed upon a block; but this expedient only 
remedied a part of the evil, for he was not able by 
any possible exertion to keep pace with the machi- 
nery. In vain the poor child declared it was not 
in his power to move quicker. He was beaten by 
the overlooker with great severity, and cursed and 
reviled from morning till night, till his life became 
a burden to him and his body was discoloured by 
bruises.' The ordinary hours of work were four- 
teen, but sometimes extended to sixteen. They 
were occasionally even longer! 

"Blincoe served four years of his apprenticeship 
at this factory; when it stopped working; and he 
was transferred, with a number of other appren- 
tices, to another one. It was a most unfortunate 
change for him and them. The cruelties that were 
practised at this next mill were, as the biographer 
says, well-nigh incredible. One practice of the over- 
lookers was to 'throw rollers, one after another, at 
the poor boy, aiming at his head, which of course 
was uncovered while at work, and nothing delighted 
the savages more than to see Blincoe stagger, and 



THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN 77 

the blood gushing out in a stream.' When Blincoe 
could not or did not keep pace with the machinery, 
the ruffians were accustomed to 'tie him up by the 
wrists to a cross-beam and keep him suspended over 
it till his agony was extreme/ 'To avoid the machi- 
nery he had to draw up his legs every time it came 
out or returned. If he did not lift them up he was 
cruelly beaten over the shins, which were bare, nor 
was he released till growing black in the face, his 
head falling over his shoulder and the wretch 
thought his victim was near expiring.' To lift the 
apprentices up by the ears, shake them violently, 
and then dash them upon the floor with the utmost 
fury, was one of many inhuman sports in which the 
overlookers appeared to take much delight. 

"Among the most singular punishments inflicted 
on him was that of 'screwing small hand-vices of a 
pound weight, more or less, to his nose and ears, 
one to each part; and these have been kept on as 
he worked for hours together.' . . . 'Sometimes he 
has been commanded to pull off his coat and get 
into a large crib, when the savage, being sure of his 
mark, and that not a blow would be lost, used to 
beat him till he was tired.' Nor were these excep- 
tional instances of cruelty practised upon one un- 
fortunate boy. Quite the contrary. 'All the punish- 
ments he suffered were inflicted on others, and in 
some cases even to a worse degree than on himself. 
He even considers he came off tolerably welP the 
story says compared with his associates, 'many of 



78 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

whom he believes in his conscience lost their lives 
and died at the apprentice house, from the effects 
of hard usage, bad and scanty food, and excessive 
labour.' 

"A few more details must be added, which will 
also serve to bring the ordinary arrangements of 
the factory of that time more clearly into view. 
'The apprentices had their breakfast generally of 
water-porridge . . . which they took in the mill. 
The breakfast hour was eight o'clock, but the machi- 
nery did not stop, and so irregular were their meals 
it sometimes did not arrive till ten or eleven o'clock.' 
It must be remembered that they rose at five ! 'At 
other times the overlookers would not allow the 
apprentices to eat it, and it stood till it grew cold. 
'Forty minutes were allowed for dinner, of which 
time full one-half was absorbed in cleaning the 
frames. Sometimes the overlookers detained them 
in the mill the whole dinner-time, on which occa- 
sions a halfpenny was given, or rather promised. 
On these occasions they had to work the whole day 
through, generally sixteen hours without rest or 
food' On Saturday they commonly worked till mid- 
night; and sometimes till six on Sunday morning. 

" 'Bad as the food was, the cookery was still 
worse. It was no better than hogwash.' The com- 
parison here with hog's-wash is no mere rhetorical 
figure. 'The store pigs and the apprentices used 
to fare pretty much alike,' whilst 'the fatting 
pigs fared luxuriously compared with them.' These 



THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN 79 

'were often regaled with meal balls made into dough 
and given in the shape of dumplings,' and a pretty 
story (of its kind) is told in connection with this 
practice. 

" 'Blincoe and those who were in the part of the 
building contiguous to the pigsties used to keep a 
sharp eye upon the fatting pigs and their meal balls, 
and as soon as they saw the swine-herd withdraw, 
he used to slip down-stairs, and stealing slyly 
towards the trough, plunge his hand in at the loop- 
holes, and steal as many dumplings as he could 
grasp.' But the pigs, 'though generally esteemed 
the most stupid of animals, soon hit upon an expe- 
dient that baffled the hungry boys; for the instant 
the meal balls were put into their troughs they vora- 
ciously seized them and threw them into the dirt 
out of their reach. Nor this alone; made wise by 
repeated losses, they kept a sharp lookout, and the 
moment they ascertained the approach of the half- 
famished apprentices they set up so loud a chorus 
of snorts and grunts it was heard in the kitchen, 
when out rushed the swine-herd armed with a whip, 
from which combined means of protection for the 
swine this accidental source of obtaining a good din- 
ner was soon lost.' 

"Owing to these, and many like sources of sick- 
ness and disease, it is not surprising to learn that 
'numerous contagious fevers' arose in this mill, nor 
'that the number of deaths should be such as to 
require frequent supplies of parish children to fill 



80 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

up the vacancies.' Blincoe 'had known as many as 
forty boys sick at once, being a fourth part of the 
whole number employed in the mill,' and 'none were 
considered sick till it was found impossible, by men- 
aces or corporal punishment, to keep them to their 
work.' It became necessary to bury those who 
died in various churchyards; not only to find suf- 
ficient room for their bodies, but so as to draw less 
attention to the great mortality." 

It relieves the indictment, made against human 
nature by the shocking story of Blincoe, to remem- 
ber that its publication aroused horror and so stirred 
the public conscience as to inaugurate the beginnings 
of reform. But it is not to be supposed that the 
story rests on irresponsible gossip nor is the product 
of a writer seeking a sensation. It was not an iso- 
lated but a typical case. This is abundantly evi- 
denced by the sworn testimony before the First 
Royal Commission, whose aim it was to interfere 
with economic freedom. 

A case in point is the sad tale of a little girl of 
ten, whose father testified that she died of over- 
work. On the day of her death she had worked 
all day in the mill. She was unable to do her work 
and a little boy offered to assist her. On her way 
home she fell several times from exhaustion. She 
reached her father's door with difficulty and never 
spoke afterwards. She died in the night. When 
the Commission adjourned after hearing this wit- 
ness, its chairman, Mr. Sadler, went to his home and 



THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN 81 

that evening wrote the pathetic lines, "The Factory 
Girl's Last Day" : 

'Twas on a winter's morning, 

The weather wet and wild ; 
Three hours before the dawning 

The father roused his child; 
Her daily morsel bringing, 

The darksome room he paced, 
And cried, "The bell is ringing, 

My hapless darling, haste!" 

"Father, I'm up, but weary, 

I scarce can reach the door, 
And long the way and dreary 

Oh, carry me once more! 
To help us we've no mother, 

And you have no employ; 
They killed my little brother 

Like him, I'll work and die." 

Her wasted form seemed nothing; 

The load was at his heart; 
The sufferer he kept soothing 

'Till at the mill they part. 
The overlooker met her 

As to her frame she crept, 
And with his thong he beat her, 

And cursed her as she wept. 

At last the engine ceasing, 

The captive homeward rushed; 
She thought her strength increasing 

'Twas hope her spirits flushed. 
She left ; but oft she tarried ; 

She fell and rose no more, 
Till, by her comrades carried, 

She reached her father's door. 



82 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

These are, of course, extreme illustrations, but 
they are here employed for the sake of the principle 
at issue. Reforms have happily modified the cruelty 
of working conditions. But until the principle con- 
trolling human labor is itself changed, there is no 
guarantee that the details of its application will 
not be cruel. The challenge we are considering is 
concerned not, with a question of degree, but of 
kind. It is not the degree of cruelty more or less 
that a civilized man ought to humiliate himself by 
discussing, but the kind of treatment a civilized man 
deserves. Crusoe's challenge to industry applies 
not to details, but to a basic fact. The challenge 
deals with to-day. On this issue it is illuminating 
to remember that it was a period comparatively 
recent, which called forth Mrs. Browning's thrill- 
ing poem, "The Cry of the Children," and also that 
it was effective in arousing feelings that the crudest 
facts had failed to stir : 

Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers, 

Ere the sorrow comes with years ? 
They are leaning their young heads against their mothers, 

And that cannot stop their tears. 
The young lambs are bleating in the meadows, 

The young birds are chirping in the nest, 
The young fawns are playing with the shadows, 

The young flowers are blowing toward the west 
But the young, young children, O my brothers, 

They are weeping bitterly! 
They are weeping in the playtime of the others, 

In the country of the free. 



CHAPTER VI 

WHY LABOR UNIONS AROSE 

' I V HAT in a country calling itself civilized and 
* maintaining thousands of institutions at vast 
expense during centuries of time for the express 
purpose of making known Christian ideals of con- 
duct, that nevertheless it should have been neces- 
sary for Parliament to pass any laws at all to pre- 
vent the working of women in the mines and the 
working of little children in cotton factories more 
than twelve hours a day seems incredible and is a 
humiliating exhibition of greed and hypocrisy. 

But this is not the worst of it. After such laws 
were passed, the manufacturers either refused to 
obey them, or made them ineffective. They were 
unpatriotic anarchists. Parochial authorities ap- 
prenticed thousands of children under their control. 
Wagon loads of children as young as six years were 
sent from London and elsewhere to work in cotton 
mills fifteen hours a day. A law was passed for 
their protection, but because by an oversight it 
omitted to mention children, who were not appren- 
ticed, the law was of little use. It could be circum- 
vented and it was. This is typical. 

It was because the law of itself failed to furnish 
83 



84 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

relief from the barbarous cruelty of the go-as-you- 
please policy, that the laborers found it necessary 
to associate themselves together for their own pro- 
tection. Hence the origin of labor unions. But 
this is not the worst of it. The manufacturers 
secured the passage of a law making it illegal to 
belong to a labor union. Law-makers are usually 
humorless. Here is a bit of humor, although it 
must have been unconscious. This law made it ille- 
gal for laborers to do what the law had tried to do 
and failed. Trades guilds had been destroyed under 
Edward VI, and for three hundred years there were 
none. But the factory system made them a human 
and national necessity. They met at first in secret, 
like the early Christians in the catacombs. Perse- 
cution could not prevent their growth any more 
than it could the growth of the early Christians. 

The responsible reason for the origin of labor 
unions was the policy of manufacturers. Rebellion 
on the part of workmen is always and everywhere 
in direct proportion to autocracy on the part of 
management. If the destruction of machinery by 
workmen seemed stupid but explainable; the use of 
the machinery by owners was stupid and criminal. 
Labor unions have frequently made stupid mistakes 
just as capitalistic trusts have. They have some- 
times made their chief concern to be wages, as the 
management has made its chief concern to be profit. 
But on the whole, we are all under an immense, but 
unrecognized, moral debt to labor unions, not only 



WHY LABOR UNIONS AROSE 85 

for the preservation, but also for the advancement 
of civilization and decency. 

As a practical factor in the organization of in- 
dustry, both management and men attach entirely 
too much importance to labor unions. This is a 
natural danger common to all organizations. An 
idea begets an organization, the organization has a 
tendency to kill the idea. A labor union is not an 
end in itself, but a means to an end. Both sides, 
especially the management, make the frequent and 
serious mistake of treating it as an end in itself. 
The labor union is a symptom of the disease, not 
the disease itself. The only way to get rid of labor 
unions is to remove the cause of their existence. 
When that cause is removed, workmen will not care 
whether their union goes out of existence or not, 
for its aim will have been accomplished. For the 
management to try to get rid of it without remov- 
ing its cause is stupid and futile. They might as 
well try to fight against the law of gravitation. 

This attempt is like trying to purify the water 
in a well by painting the pump. It is like the attempt 
of trying to prevent an explosion in the boiler by 
sitting on the safety valve. It will not prevent the 
explosion ; it will expedite it. The unions will thrive 
on persecution. Christianity owes Nero a vote of 
"thanks for the free advertisement he gave it by his 
persecution of it. The management may try as 
best they can to camouflage their purpose by stating 
it in terms of "the open shop," or even by harness- 



86 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

ing patriotism to their purpose by calling it "the 
American plan," but this deceives nobody but them- 
selves. It does not deceive even them. It not only 
deceives nobody, but it subjects the management to 
well-deserved ridicule, which is fatal to their success. 

Mr. Dooley, in the following brief passage, states 
all it is necessary to know about the open shop cam- 
paign and the humor of it makes further argument 
seem useless: 

"What's all this that's in the papers about the 
open shop?" asked Mr. Hennessey. 

"Why, don't you know?" said Mr. Dooley. 
"Really, I'm surprised at yer ignorance, Hinnissey. 
What is th' open shop? Sure, 'tis where they kape 
the doors open to accommodate th' constant stream 
av' min comin' in t' take jobs cheaper than th' min 
what has th' jobs. 'Tis like this, Hinnissey: Sup- 
pose wan av these freeborri citizens is workin' in 
an open shop f'r th' princely wages av wan large 
iron dollar a day av tin hour. Along comes anither 
son-av-gun and he sez to th' boss 'Oi think Oi could 
handle th' job nicely f'r ninety cints.' 'Sure,' sez th' 
boss, and th' wan dollar man gets out into th' crool 
woruld t' exercise his inalienable roights as a free- 
born American citizen an' scab on some other poor 
devil. An 7 so it goes on, Hinnissey. An' who gits 
th' binefit? Thrue, it saves th' boss money, but he 
don't care no more f'r money thin he does f'r his 
roight eye. 

"It's all principle wid him. He hates t' see men 



WHY LABOR UNIONS AROSE 87 

robbed av their indipendence. They must have 
their indipendence, regardless av anything else." 

"But," said Mr. Hennessey, "these open shop 
min ye menshun say they are f'r unions iv properly 
conducted." 

"Shure," said Mr. Dooley, "iv properly con- 
ducted. An' there we are: An' how would they 
have thim conducted? No strikes, no rules, no 
contracts, no scales, hardly iny wages an' dam few 
mimbers." 

But whether a labor union ought to be or not 
to be, is not the question. It is merely an effect, 
not a cause. We assume that if employers have a 
right to unite for mutual benefit, so have the labor- 
ers. The truth of Condorcet's statement is axio- 
matic; "Either no individual member of the human 
race has any real rights, or else all have the same." 
But even granting that this question were debatable, 
the real question at issue is not a labor union's right 
to exist; it is rather the reason why it exists. If 
any one wished to destroy it, the only possible way, 
as well as the only right way, is to remove the need 
for it. 

The need for labor unions has been quite obvious 
to all who desired to know. This need may be 
stated most briefly in effective language by quoting 
two poems, one near the beginning and one from 
a late period of the factory system. For poetry is 
more true than history. History gives us the or- 
dered record of events; poetry their inner meaning, 



88 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

and no one knows an event or fact, until he under- 
stands its inner meaning. 

The first poem is a popular ballad chanted about 
the streets of Norwich and Leeds and quoted by 
Lord Macaulay in his "History of England." Its 
words are put into the mouth of a typical master- 
manufacturer : 

We will make them work hard for sixpence a day, 
Though a shilling they deserve if they had their just pay; 
If at all they murmur and say 'tis too small, 
We bid them choose whether they'll work at all. 
And thus we do gain all our wealth and estate, 
By many poor men that work early and late. 
Then hey for the clothing trade ! It goes on brave. 
We scorn for to toyl and moyl, nor yet to slave ; 
Our workmen do work hard, but we live at ease, 
We go when we will and we come when we please. 

The other poem is by no less a genius than Shel- 
ley. It portrays the natural effect of the attitude 
described in the previous poem: 

What is freedom? Ye can tell 

That which slavery is too well, 

For its very name has grown 

To an echo of your own. 

'Tis to work and have such pay 

As just keeps life from day to day 

In your limbs as in a cell 

For the tyrants' use to dwell, 

So that ye for them are made 

Loom and plough and sword and spade, 



WHY LABOR UNIONS AROSE 89 

With or without your own will, bent 
To their defense and nourishment. 
'Tis to see your children weak 
With their mothers pine and peak 
When the winter winds are bleak 
They are dying whilst I speak. 
'Tis to hunger for such diet 
As the rich man in his riot 
Casts to the fat dogs that lie 
Surfeiting beneath his eye. 



'Tis to be a slave in soul, 

And to hold no strong control 

Over your own wills, but be 

All that others make of ye; 

And at length, when ye complain 

With a murmur weak and vain, 

'Tis to see the tyrant's crew 

Ride over your wives and you 

Blood is on the grass like dew! 

Then it is to feel revenge, 

Fiercely thirsting to exchange 

Blood for blood, and wrong for wrong; 

Do not thus when ye are strong! 

Birds find rest in narrow nest, 

When weary of their winged quest ; 

Beasts find fare in woody lair 

When storms and snow are in the air; 

Horses, oxen, have a home 

When from daily toil they come; 

Household dogs, when the wind roars, 

Find a home within warm doors; 

Asses, swine, have litter spread, 

And with fitting food are fed; 



90 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

All things have a home but one: 
Thou, O Englishman, hast none! 
This is slavery! Savage men, 
Or wild beasts within a den, 
Would endure not as ye do; 
But such ills they never knew. 



Rise, like lions after slumber, 
In unvanquishable number! 
Shake your chains to earth, like dew 
Which in sleep had fallen on you! 
Ye are many, they are few. 



CHAPTER VII 

LABOR AS A COMMODITY 




TTERE are all the elements necessary for a bitter 
-- * and continuous civil war between two groups 
of citizens contending as rivals, although they are 
natural allies in a common cause. And a civil war, 
either open or secret, we have had for one hundred 
fifty years, and more. The monotonous story of this 
industrial civil war would have been a very different 
story, if both parties to it had been wise enough to 
have considered causes rather than effects. This 
is what they did not do and have not yet done. 

The use of steam and electricity created a new 
world. Modern business is one of the most astound- 
ing and inspiring achievements of mankind. The 
initiative, energy, courage, and romance exhibited 
by it constitute a thrilling story. Modern business, 
unlike government, appeals to hope instead of fear, 
concerns itself with "Thou shalts" instead of "Thou 
shalt nots," and it is yet destined, I believe, to be 
the saviour of civilization, provided it has the capac- 
ity to discover and practice the great creative prin- 
ciple, which is certain to distinguish the new age 
upon which we have now entered. 

But modern business, during the entire period of 

91 



92 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the industrial revolution, which is still in process, 
has made one tragic mistake. It displayed marvel- 
ous ingenuity in the invention and perfection of 
machinery and the formulation of efficiency methods. 
But it forgot the chief element in production, the 
man. It attempted the impossible to play "Ham- 
let" with Hamlet left out. It has made the stupid 
blunder of treating labor as a commodity. 

I go into a modern factory and visit first the 
manager's office. I see on his desk a typical book 
on political economy like those used in all colleges 
and universities until recently, and still used in most 
of them. I open it and read a passage like this: 
"Labor, like flour or cotton cloth, should always 
be bought in the cheapest market and sold in the 
dearest." This states the policy on which the fac- 
tory is operated. 

Then I go into the factory to search for this 
commodity, called labor. I cannot find it. It glares 
by its absence. What do I see? I see only men, 
lovers of sunshine, hungry for music, husbands of 
women, fathers of children, for whom they would 
sacrifice their lives and are doing so, men just like 
the manager and myself. There is something wrong 
somewhere. What I see in the factory and what I 
read in the manager's book do not agree. 

There's only one thing wrong; the statement in 
the manager's book is a lie. Otherwise it is all 
right. Like the student's answer to Professor Hux- 
ley's question: u What is a lobster?" The student 



LABOR AS A COMMODITY 93 

said it is a red fish that moves backward. To this 
Huxley replied: "Your answer is entirely correct, 
except for three things ; it is not a fish ; it is not red ; 
it does not move backward." As a simple matter 
of fact there is no such thing as labor to be bought 
and sold and never was. Labor as commodity is 
pure fiction. It has nothing to do with fact. It is 
the creation of a political economist's imagination 
which manufacturers have tried to convert into a 
fact and failed. We have been led to suppose that 
political economy is an exact science. Now we 
have discovered that we have been deceived. When 
a laborer comes to the factory in the morning, does 
he carry pounds or yards of labor to sell as a com- 
modity? No, he comes empty handed; he brings 
only himself. We have, then, no such commodity 
as labor; we have only a man who is willing to 
labor; a very different proposition. As soon as you I 
join a man and his labor together, you are on new I 
ground and have a new standard of values. You \ 
are handling not a commodity, but a living man, 
who requires an altogether different treatment. 

The false conception of labor as a commodity, 
transformed a man into "a hand." The machine 
tended to make the worker a part of it; to reduce 
him to a cog in the wheel. The workman was 
treated as the one bit of machinery not yet invented. 
Man as a machine is clearly portrayed in Adam 
Smith's description of pin-making, as practiced in 
his day: "One man draws out the wire; another 



94 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

straightens it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; 
a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; 
to make the head requires two or three distinct 
operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to 
whiten the pin is another; it is even a trade by itself 
to put them into the paper; and the important 
business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided 
into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in 
some manufactories are all performed by distinct 
hands." 

The eighteen manual operations here described 
were decreased just as the machinery was invented. 
Mrs. Browning said that in her day it took seven 
men to make a pin. The damage to the man him- 
self involved in the process of his playing the part 
of a cog in a wheel has never been better stated 
than by Ruskin, when he wrote: "We have much 
studied and much perfected of late the great civil- 
ized invention of the division of labor, only we 
give it a false name. It is not, truly speaking, the 
labor that is divided, but the men divided into the 
mere segments of men broken into small frag- 
ments and crumbs of life ; so that all the little pieces 
of intelligence that are left in a man are not enough 
to make a pin or the head of a nail. Now it is a 
good and desirable thing, truly, to make many pins 
in a day; but if we could only see with what crystal 
sand their points were polished sand of human 
souls, much to be magnified before it can be dis- 
cerned for what it is we should think there might 



LABOR AS A COMMODITY 95 

be some loss in it also. And the great cry that 
rises from all our manufacturing cities, louder than 
their furnace-blast, is all in very deed tor this: 
that we manufacture everything there except men; 
we blanch cotton, and strengthen steel, and refine 
sugar, and shape pottery; but to brighten, to 
strengthen, to refine, or to form a single living 
spirit, never enters into our estimate of advan* 
tages." 

The making of men as well as pins and shoes 
does not seem to be included in a factory's program. 
The distance between stupidity and crime is short. 
The treatment of man as a commodity is not only 
a stupid blunder, but a criminal blunder. After 
classifying souls with flour and cotton cloth, the 
next step is to sell them along with the other com- 
modities. And to sell souls is nothing short of a 
crime. In the last book of the Christian Bible is 
a fiery and dramatic passage, which suggests that 
this is an ancient custom in the commerce of cities. 
The passage sounds as modern as if the Apostle 
John had written it for New York or Chicago. He 
says: "Alas, alas, thou great city, O Babylon, the 
mighty city! For in one short hour thy doom has 
come ! And the merchants of the earth weep aloud 
and lament over her, because now there is no sale 
for their cargoes Cargoes of gold and silver, Of 
jewels and pearls, Of fine linen, purple and silk, and 
of scarlet stuff; All kinds of rare woods, and all 
kinds of goods in ivory and in very costly wood, in 



96 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

bronze, steel and marble. Also cinnamon and amo- 
mum; Odours to burn an incense or for perfume; 
frankincense, wine, oil; fine flour, wheat, cattle and 
sheep; horses and carriages and slaves; and the 
souls of men." 

The whole of modern industry has been organ- 
ized on the basis of this falsehood. Until this 
falsehood is removed, there can be no hope of peace 
in the industrial world and should be none. 



CHAPTER VIII 

THE RIGHT TO GET DRUNK 

/ TT S HEREFORE, while it may be unexpected, it 
is not at all surprising that workmen turn to 
drink as their chief comfort. It is the natural con- 
sequence of exhausting labor under degrading con- 
ditions. The rum shop keepers of Australia, fully 
appreciated the fact when they violently opposed 
the reduction of the laboring day to eight hours. 
The workman's craving for drink decreases as im- 
provement in his condition increases. 

A vivid and humorous account of workmen's 
amusements at the beginning of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, by one of their own number, and quoted in 
"Progress of the Working Classes," by Ludlow 
and Jones, is sufficient evidence of this fact. It 
says: "Large numbers of working people attended 
fairs and wakes, at the latter of which jumping in 
sacks, climbing greased poles, grinning through 
horse-collars for tobacco, hunting pigs with soaped 
tails, were the choicest diversions. . . . An almost 
general unchastity prevailed. . . . But the drink 
was the mainspring of enjoyment. When Saturday 
evening came, indulgences began which continued 

97 



98 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

till Sunday evening. Fiddles were to be heard on 
all sides, and limp-looking men and pale-faced 
women thronged the public-houses, and reeled and 
jigged till they were turned, drunk and riotous, into 
the streets at most unseasonable hours. On the 
Sunday morning the public-houses were again 
thronged, that the thirst following the indulgence 
of the night might be quenched. When church hour 
approached, however, the churchwardens, with long 
staves tipped with silver, sallied forth, and seized 
all the drunken and unkempt upon whom they could 
lay their hands, and these, being carefully lodged 
in a pew provided for them, were left there to 
enjoy the sermon, whilst their captors usually ad- 
journed to some tavern near at hand for the pur- 
pose of rewarding themselves with a glass or two 
for the important services they had rendered to 
morality and religion." 

It would be more comfortable if we ended our 
investigation one hundred years from the present. 
But it will be more profitable if we courageously 
face the facts of today. The same type of condi- 
tions persists today; in some respects not to the 
same degree, in other respects, aggravated by the 
perfection of mechanics. 

Recently I visited one of the pig-killing institu- 
tions of Chicago. The pigs enter the factory in 
blocks on a large revolving wheel, head down. 
They slide off on roller tracks in quick succession. 
There is no time to be lost in Chicago. Men are 



THE RIGHT TO GET DRUNK 99 

stationed along this track in close proximity. As 
the pigs ride rapidly by, each man does something 
to it, one to his throat, one to his internals, one 
to his hind legs, one to his front legs, one to his 
back; each man to his own piece of the pig. When 
the pig gets through running this gauntlet there is 
not much of a pig left, and when the men get 
through a day with the pigs, there is not much of 
a man left either. 

When the men finish their day's work, is it any 

wonder they get "Well," I asked my guide 

how many of the men got drunk? He answered 
"About ninety per cent." "You are putting it low, 
aren't you?" I asked. "If I worked in your factory 
I would help raise it to a hundred per cent. I 
would insist that my right to get drunk be nom- 
inated in the bond and contract. That man standing 
there, bespattered with blood and dirt all day long 
doing nothing but stick pigs, he will go insane any- 
way in two or three years. He might as well have 
some fun getting drunk, before he goes insane. 
Every night in drink he can escape into freedom and 
indulge a glorious imagination. I have never been 
drunk, but I suppose this is what happens." 

Does my reader think humor is out of place 
here? This is not humor; it is bitter irony. The 
question at issue is, shall we give precedence to 
pigs or men? If anyone thinks the irony can be 
made too bitter or the issue overstated, I ask him 
to read this description of the pig-killer, written 



100 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

by Herbert Quick in his "Broken Lance." His 
friends Olive and Morgan go in search for him. 
He had been a minister. He is a refined scholar 
and social reformer. They find him in this posi- 
tion, which he temporarily occupies. The situation 
gives you the perspective you would get if you "put 
yourself in his place" : 

"What is that terrible noise?" asked Olive again, 
as the mingled screams of piled-up agonies pierced 
their ears nearer and keener. 

"You'll soon see, ma'am," said the guide, as he 
stepped off upon the hog-killing floor. "Here it is, 



ma'am." 



"At first the steam and the hurrying confusion of 
men blurred the interior, so that all was indistinct. 
And then they saw. Somewhere back of the men, 
and below the floor, was the source whence the 
sound came. Dimly, like a moving impressionistic 
painting of some fearful engine, slowly rotated a 
great wheel, and from it seemed to come these 
sounds, which now could be separated from each 
other in culminating cries of anguish, as if a thou- 
sand steel traps were snapping on creatures penned 
up for torture. As their eyes cleared, they saw 
that the dangling forms were those of swine, and 
realized that the trap was closing, every second, on 
a helpless animal; that theirs were the cries screamed 
so dolefully forth, hour after hour, from the build- 
ing, as the poor beasts felt the clutch of the traps 
upon their legs, and were hoisted with diabolical 



THE RIGHT TO GET DRUNK ,101 



deliberation, in a succession of pjtileg tfa 
and carried, heads down, on the revolving Ferris 
wheel, on to the place where each scream went 
suddenly broken and choked as something happened 
something after which a spouting and reeking 
throat swung over toward the steaming tank, await- 
ing immersion in which hung a close-packed cluster 
of black carcasses, their blood-choked coughings and 
dying convulsions growing less and less, until they 
went rolling from their gyves of death into the 
scalding water. 

"The floor was dark with clotted and diluted 
blood, and blood spread in a coagulating mass of 
viscous red, mottled with splotches of pink foam 
about the feet of the man who stood in front of 
the line of victims, which filed before him in in- 
verted helplessness. As each one passed him, he 
seized it by the forefeet, spread the legs apart so 
as to expose the broad black throat, and then, with 
a single thrust, as skillful as the finest pass of a 
swordsman, his long keen knife went straight to 
the artery, and the spurt of crimson as it was 
withdrawn went unheeded over the man's clothes 
from waist to feet, as he mechanically pushed the 
slain brute by, and automatically reached for an- 
other and all the time the great wheel rotated, and 
out from below and behind came the volume of 
tortured screams, each moment bringing more and 
more throats before him for the knife. Hour after 
hour, day after day he stood there, the reek of gore 



102 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

In- His: nostrils,- the screech of death in his ears 
the king of slaughter, surrounded by his sanguinary 
helpers, who, with machine and cleaver and knife, 
urged on by shouted command and competing en- 
ginery, tore heads from bodies, ripped out bowels, 
dismembered frames, and sent off to some room 
where they hung cooling in long rows, the clean- 
scraped and eviscerated creatures brought here in 
thousands from green fields and pastures. But the 
central figure, the monarch of horrors to Olive's 
eyes, was the man with the knife, who, with the 
machine-like thrust, second by second smote from 
its rock of flesh the fountain of blood, and stood 
like an embodied emblem of carnage, in steam and 
reek and expiring clamor, a red angel of death, 
dripping gore from every finger, and bathed from 
head to foot in the tide of butchery. 

"The woman stood gazing at him in a dreadful 
fascination, and the real meaning of the scene grew 
clearer and clearer through the steam and con- 
fusion. He was straight and tall, and as he did his 
horrid work, she noted in him a devilish adjustment 
of means to end in every motion and turn of wrist 
and arm and torso which reminded her dimly of such 
exhibitions of graceful motion and strength as fenc- 
ing and club-swinging a strange mingling of grace 
and diabolism. In a way he seemed almost beauti- 
ful to her. And then a sickening thing happened 
he looked at her. It was a mere glance, at first, 
a turning of the head in the easy double attention 



THE RIGHT TO GET DRUNK 103 

of the skilled workman, and then he stood, his 
dreadful work accumulating before him, and looked 
her straight in the face as if he knew her; and 
unspeakable thought ! the face seemed that of one 
she knew and loved as the most gentle being in the 
world. The eyes were blue, the hair, dark with 
sweat, or worse, was curly, and he seemed to know 
her! Her soul turned sick, and all went dark be- 
fore her eyes. She reeled, and Morgan, watchful 
for something like this, threw his arm about her, 
and half carried her toward the stairway. He was 
unspeakably alarmed at her utter whiteness, her 
limp poverty of motion or volition. 

"The guide sprang to his assistance. Morgan, 
as they went down the lift, looked back, and once 
more his eyes met those of the man with the knife 
met them in recognition; and as he did so, urged on 
by an oath from the boss, the butcher turned again 
to his work, and, as if in renunciation of any claim 
to fellowship, resumed in feverish haste and with 
undiminished skill that task which made him a terror 
and an abomination to the woman who had mis- 
guidedly penetrated to this chamber of horrors. 

"The boss could not know that his foul blasphemy 
mingled in the mind of the man with the knife, with 
old memories of the use of the same words in 
sacred chant, that as his mind wandered in the 
half-trance of mental shock, he seemed to feel him- 
self again a ministrant of religion. Could God, 
when He made man, have imagined and designed 



104 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

such abysses in his life as that which yawned be- 
tween that time and this!" 

This is a nasty subject. I realize it. I have 
purposely chosen an illustration from the worst the 
working world has to show in order to make vivid 
a basic principle, widely prevalent in modern in- 
dustry. In this typical process the machine sets 
the pace of the man's activity. The machinery is 
not assisting human labor; human labor is assisting 
machinery. The workman has ceased to be a man 
and has become a machine. Of course he gets 
drunk. Why shouldn't he? It's his way of escape 
from the monotonous grind of machinery, his way 
of seeking forgetfulness, his way of indulging at 
brief intervals the pleasant illusion that he is a 
man. It's a compliment to him that he wants to 
get drunk, that he has not quite lost his desire 
for this illusion. Ought not industry to be so 
organized as to permit workmen to feel like men 
in reality, and not compel them to resort to drink, 
seeking the illusion of their lost manhood? If they 
had a chance to get drunk with the spirit, would 
they want to get drunk with wine? 



CHAPTER IX 

NOTHING BUT WAGES 

/ "T" V HE principle at stake is just the same whether 
in a pig-killing house in Chicago, or in a cotton 
factory in a Southern State, or in a steel mill in the 
North, or a sugar plantation in Hawaii. A work- 
man who gets nothing but wages is not getting 
enough, whatever the amount of his wages may be. 
He is after something not represented by wages. 
The hope of the world, the possibility of any prog- 
ress at all lies in the fact that workingmen are not 
satisfied merely with wages. 

What they rebel against is feudalism in any form. 
The basic factor in the whole structure of modern 
industry against which their soul revolts is clearly 
exhibited by an incident in the childhood of Prince 
Kropotkin, who never recovered from the impres- 
sion it made upon him. As he described it, it was 
the scene of his father "narrating for the children 
how he won the cross of Saint Anne and the golden 
sword which he wore. His father had served on 
the general staff in the Turkish campaign of 1828, 
and was lodged with the staff in a Turkish village 
when it took fire. Houses were enveloped in flames, 
and in one a child had been left. In response to 

105 



106 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the frantic cries of the mother, Frol, his father's 
servant, had rushed into the flames and saved the 
child, and the chief commander, who saw the deed, 
had at once given his father the cross, for gallantry. 
" 'But father,' exclaimed the children, " 'it was 
Frol who saved the child.' 'What of that?' replied 
the father, 'Was he not my man? It is all the 



same.' 



The keen and infallible instinct of the children 
penetrated at once to the moral heart of their 
father's action, as all normal and unspoiled children 
would. They instantly recognized slavery when 
they saw it. It is the same element in modern 
industry, against which workingmen are protesting. 
Its form has been changed and its hardships miti- 
gated, but the fact of slavery still remains. Its 
badge may be a wage, quite as well as a whip. The 
wage system, as now commonly practiced, is morally 
as well as economically wrong. As long as it re- 
mains unmodified by a new and different element 
there will be rebellion. 

It is quite easy to be misled by the fact that most 
industrial wars have been fought over the question 
of wages. It is obvious that both capitalists and 
laborers have frequently degenerated to the point 
where the capitalist thinks only of his profits and 
the laborer only of his wages. In which case, both 
are governed by the pig-trough philosophy; both are 
rank materialists; both have denatured their man- 
hood and are content to be mere animals. Gross 



NOTHING BUT WAGES 107 

materialism is one of the serious blights with which 
modern civilization has inflicted our world. "My 
idea of hell," said William Allen White, "is a place 
where every man owns a little property and thinks 
he is just about to lose it." 

If grabbing is the game one side is playing, why 
should not both sides engage in grabbing? This 
apparently is what they are doing, both capitalists 
and workmen alike. In the process of the game, 
strikes, lockouts, violence, distrust, lies, soldiering, 
sharp practices, financial losses, public hardships, 
are not only involved; they are necessary conse- 
quences. They must occur in the future, as in the 
past, so long as this kind of game is played. They 
are the symptoms of a basic defect, namely, that 
the game itself is morally and economically wrong. 
Profit cannot be sought directly without violating 
moral principles. It is a legitimate by-product but 
not a legitimate main-product. Only as a by-prod- 
uct, only when it is intrinsically related to a function 
performed, is profit justly acquired. It makes all 
the difference in the world whether profit is put in 
the first place or in the second place. Until function 
is put in the first place and profit in the second place, 
there is little prospect that civil war in industry will 
be abolished or even abated. A grab-game, with 
money for the stakes, occupies the foreground 
whenever industry is organized on the basis of the 
pig-trough philosophy. 

While this is the fact most visible on the surface, 



108 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

it is a superficial view to think it is the significant 
fact. To discover the real fact we must go deeper. 
To the workingmen at least, the wage is chiefly 
regarded as a symbol. Their motive lies with some- 
thing else, something vastly more important. They 
are thinking of wife and children, of the tragedy 
of losing a child through lack of means to secure 
medical aid, of education, music, books; they crave 
a more abundant life, of which money is the symbol. 

From tragic first-hand experience he feels the 
force of such facts as these. The length of his life 
is determined by material circumstances; the average 
life of the rich man is over fifty-five years, that of 
the poor man twenty-eight years. In the rich 
quarters of Paris, the death-rate is ten in one thou- 
sand; in the poor quarter of Montparnasse, it is 
forty-three in a thousand. In Brussels the mortality 
among children under five years of age is six per 
cent, in the families of capitalists, while in those of 
laborers it is fifty-four per cent. Disease multiplies 
in proportion to poverty. The number of marriages 
is determined by economic conditions. The coef- 
ficient of prostitution rises in years of adversity 
and falls with the return of prosperity. The malady 
of illiteracy is directly the product of poverty. 

The question of wages, then, to the workman is 
not a question of wages, but of something very 
different. It is a question of life, and love, and 
morals. The picture of Crusoe writing a journal, 
in his bower, is a picture of the average workman's 



NOTHING BUT WAGES 109 

groping aspirations. He, too, desires leisure to 
write a journal, the physical strength to do it, the 
mental ability equal to it, and above all, to be the 
kind of man to think things worth recording. Do 
I over-honor him? Perhaps. If there be workmen 
not animated by these desires, so much the worse is 
the indictment against our economic order. It's a 
nation's business to stimulate and keep alive such 
aspirations in her citizens. If it fails at this point, 
it fails altogether. Truly said David Starr Jordan 
that u the final test of any nation is in the oppor- 
tunity it gives its average man and still more in the 
fitness of the average man to grasp this oppor- 
tunity." 

However d^imly seen or feebly expressed, the 
desire for a more abundant life is the motive back 
of the demand for wages and the rebellion against 
the slavery of machinery. Among large and grow- 
ing groups of workmen it is not dimly seen at all, 
but very clearly seen and always has been. It is 
highly significant to note how keenly the working- 
men in Europe and America perceived the inner 
meaning of the war against Germany and the moral 
confusion of the Allies since its close. It was a 
class of workmen in England that not only per- 
ceived it but expressed it more effectively than any 
other class witness "The Aims of Labour" by 
Arthur Henderson, one of the noblest documents 
that issued from this war or any other. 

The inner meaning of the war and the reaction 



110 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

following it is so pointedly stated by Gino Speranza 
in a recent article in the Hibbert Journal, and his 
statement makes so clear the root difficulty with 
modern industry and the reason for present unrest, 
that I quote from it at some length: 

"Could there be a darker indictment against the 
age of the machine than the world's attitude to- 
wards the Great War within a brief span of its 
triumphant close? We called it a struggle for 
freedom from German hegemony, from Prussian 
militarism, but it was much more than that. Ger- 
manism meant Standardisation' of the world's ef- 
forts; it meant, had it succeeded, the plotting out of 
the world into 'organised,' 'specialised,' and 'regu- 
lated' zones of trade and economic activities. A 
German victory would have carried with it the 
gradual centralisation and standardisation of human 
culture divided into classified workers and pro- 
ducers, each trained to efficiency in the one kind of 
labour, mental or manual, to which he would have 
been 'scientifically' assigned. Europe, if not Amer- 
ica, would have been changed into a well-ordered, 
spick-and-span, busy, productive, comfortable, and 
highly 'organised' world, but a world filled with a 
spiritually enslaved humanity. In short, German 
success would have meant the safe entrenchment 
for another century of the age of the machine. 
. . . Yet within a few months of the armistice 
the forces of destructive criticism largely succeeded 
in beclouding the great spiritual issues of that 



NOTHING BUT WAGES 111 

struggle, often honouring those who had opposed 
it or endangered its success. Men and women who 
had suffered in the cause now heard nothing but 
discussions of victory in terms of lost capital, of 
lost trade, of diminished man power, or of the 
inability of the enemy to pay indemnities. Leaders 
announced various programmes of 'reconstruction/ 
but what did such programmes hold forth? They 
all sought to force the molten mass of mentally 
dazed and body-weary humanity from its golden 
crucible of spiritual exaltation into the old grooves 
of a materialistic and 'mechanistic' world. Human- 
ity in the throes of its spiritual re-birth cried out 
for Messiahs, and the 'reconstructionists' again 
tendered to it efficiency engineers! The financiers 
said the world's unrest was due to the exchange 
and an unsettled trade balance; the economists said 
it was due to lack of production, which raised the 
cost of living; the reconstructionists said the hope 
of the world rested on the possibility of 'speeding 
up,' of earning more wages so as to have the old 
comforts and more of them. The post-war slogan 
of every reformer, of every statesman, of every 
leader became: 'Produce! Produce! Produce!' It 
was the old motto of the age of the machine, and 
it rang false in a world ennobled but worn out by 
a struggle to be free. And none of the panaceas 
announced brought relief; neither high wages, nor 
increased comforts, nor participation in profits, nor 
political recognition stilled the unrest; for behind 






112 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

and beyond the visible, tangible, and often grossly 
selfish and material demands lay the awakened urge 
of mankind wishing to be rid of the tyranny it had 
fought. 

"There is political tyranny a form of oppres- 
sion which men have learned to distinguish and 
have forged weapons to fight; but there is a more 
insidious tyranny, not as easily discernible and 
harder to cast off, and that is the tyranny of ideas. 
Of such is the tyranny of the age of the machine 
a body of superstitious beliefs, scientifically but- 
tressed, in the power and importance of those forces 
which make men comfortable, for which we have 
surrendered our faith in the forces that make men 
free." 

This thoughtful statement accurately expresses 
the dominant and irrepressible issue before modern 
industry. It is an infinitely profounder issue than 
that raised by the pig-trough philosophy. The 
acid test of the value of machinery is the place we 
assign to it in our thought. Is it to be used to 
enslave men or to free them? Was machinery 
made for man or he for it? In the organization 
of modern industry, will men be used to assist 
machinery, or machinery to assist men? Is the 
tendency of modern industry to make goods cheaper 
and men dearer, or the reverse? Will factories 
accept as their natural function the making of men 
as well as the making of goods? The question at 
issue is not mechanical, but moral and scientific. 



NOTHING BUT WAGES 113 

Will we dethrone marvelous modern inventions as 
masters of the human spirit, and enthrone the 
human spirit as much more marvelous? Will we 
be sufficiently fair to the facts to assign to the man 
and the machine the relative values expressed by 
Mrs. Browning, when she said: 

If we trod the deeps of ocean, 
If we struck the stars in rising, 
If we wrapped the globe intensely 
With one hot electric breath, 
'Twere but power within our tether, 
No new spirit-power comprising, 
And in life we were not greater men 
Nor bolder men in death. 



CHAPTER X 

A DIVIDED HOUSE 

'TPHIS, then, is "Robinson Crusoe's" challege to 
* modern industry. It is not a superficial criti- 
cism, but questions the very basis on which industry 
rests. It deals not with effects, but causes. It aims 
not at reformation, but transformation. This is 
not merely criticism. It is constructive criticism 
that is, it is criticism by construction. 

We are not indulging in diagnosis as a pleasant 
pastime. We are searching for a way out of a 
trouble already existing. "Robinson Crusoe's" 
challenge did not create the difficulty. The indus- 
trial revolution creates it. Modern industry's in- 
jury to the nation creates it. It is the facts them- 
selves, which constitute the challenge. "Robinson 
Crusoe" only makes clear their inner meaning. 

If any one desires to understand the challenge 
made by the industrial revolution to thoughtful men, 
let him read Charles Reade's novel "Put Yourself 
in His Place." Certain elements of barbarism ex- 
isting in the period he describes have been elim- 
inated, but the essential elements of the problem 
remain and some additional ones have been added, 
as any one can see, if he will visit some of our steel 

114 



A DIVIDED HOUSE 115 

mills, coal mines, cotton factories and sugar planta- 
tions. 

If any one wishes to know the inexcusable and 
unscientific waste in modern industry; wastage in 
money, production, good-will and human values, let 
him read the illuminating and courageous report, 
"Waste in Industry," made by the Federated Amer- 
ican Engineering Societies. 

If any one wants to realize the serious damage 
modern industry is doing the nation, let him open 
his eyes and look around. The nation socially is 
very sick. Everywhere men are divided into classes 
according to their tastes and occupations, coniending 
for their personal interests. Racial antagonisms, 
economic jealousies, class cleavages are destroying 
America as a society. Civil war in industry is 
chronic. It is a stock remark of the super-patriot 
that in America there are no classes. No, not 
theoretically. This remark is built out of his mem- 
ory, not out of the facts. All men with eyes to 
see know that in very few places in America are 
there anything else but classes. 

*'A country," says Mazzini, "is a fellowship of 
free and equal men bound together in a brotherly 
concord of labor towards a single end." This ideal 
with which we began remains only as a memory and 
has ceased to exist as a fact, except partially and at 
rare intervals during a period of war. Every lover 
of his country hates this fact, but he can never help 
to destroy it by shutting his eyes to it. He must 



116 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

not be a blind lover, but a lover like Lowell, whose 
love gave him the courage to say : 

I loved my country, so as only they, 
Who love a mother fit to die for, may; 
I loved her old renown, her stainless fame, 
What better proof than that I loathed her shame. 

A true lover of his country, like Lowell, is op- 
timist enough to face facts. The fact is that we 
are a house divided against itself. It ought to be 
clear to thoughtful lovers of their country, that the 
time has come to revive and resound the solemn 
warning uttered a half-century ago by our typical 
American, u a house divided against itself cannot 
stand." The only way a man, who is optimist 
enough to face the facts as they are, can hope to 
retain his optimism is to do something to help 
change the facts. If our house is not to fall it must 
cease to be divided, as Lincoln said. If it is to 
cease to be divided it is obvious that a means must 
be found to bring all men as citizens into common 
council to secure mutual understanding and con- 
certed action. 

As a start in this direction, one thing is indis- 
pensably important. The external conditions of the 
period described in Readers novel, have been largely 
altered, but the title of his book has undying social 
significance. "Put Yourself in His Place" is in 
fact the statement of a universal moral principle, 
a spiritual axiom of social progress. To achieve 



A DIVIDED HOUSE 117 

this act is both a science and an art. Reade calls 
it the "great transmigratory art," and declares that 
"were it to be taught as generally as reading and 
writing, that teaching alone would quadruple the 
intelligence of mankind and go far to double its 
virtue." 

Reade is right. By far the larger amount of 
injustice practiced by men is due not so much to 
their lack of good-will, as to their inveterate in- 
ability to put themselves in the other fellow's place. 
The act of sympathetic imagination by which we 
put ourselves in the other fellow's place, take the 
point of view of a class other than our own, is the 
first step towards progress in adjusting industrial 
disputes. It is the one way to acquire knowledge 
of his problem and find a solution of our own. But 
you cannot perform this act, you cannot put your- 
self in his place, except through one faculty and 
that is an open mind. 

It may be that before you acquire the habit of 
open-mindedness, the capacity to take in a new 
idea, it will be necessary for you to pass through 
a mental revolution. That is just what modern 
industry most needs to happen to it. It should be 
obvious that it is idle to expect any progress with- 
out an open mind. 

Every great leader of the world's thought and 
action has insisted on its indispensable importance. 
Confucius expressed it in the golden phrase "mental 
hospitality." Socrates used a phrase out of which 



118 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

was coined the word "philosopher." He said, "I 
am not a wise man; I am a lover of wisdom; a 
seeker after new ideas." Jesus called it, "the spirit 
of truth." So highly did he regard it that he called 
it a holy spirit. The reason why these masterful 
leaders of men so prized the habit of being open- 
minded is because they understood that without men* 
tal hospitality no progress in any line is possible. 

Mental hospitality is such essential equipment for 
an understanding of what is to follow that I em- 
phasize it by restating it in an unforgettable para- 
ble, a poem by Charlotte Perkins Stetson, called 
"The Conservative": 

The garden bed I wandered by 

One bright and cheerful morn, 
When I found a new-fledged butterfly 

A-sitting on a thorn, 
A black and crimson butterfly 

All doleful and forlorn. 

I thought that life could have no sting 

To infant butterflies. 
So I gazed on this unhappy thing 

With wonder and surprise, 
While sadly with his waving wing 

He wiped his weeping eyes. 

Said I, "What can the matter be? 

Why weepest thou so sore 
With garden fair and sunlight free 

And flowers in goodly store?" 
But he only turned away from me 

And burst into a roar. 



A DIVIDED HOUSE 119 

Cried he, "My legs are thin and few, 

Where once I had a swarm ; 
Soft, fuzzy fur, a joy to view, 

Once kept my body warm, 
Before these flapping wing things grew 

To hamper and deform." 

At that outrageous bug I shot 

The fury of mine eye. 
Said I, in scorn all burning hot, 

In rage and anger high, 
"You ignominious idiot, 

Those wings were made to fly." 

"I do not want to fly," said he, 

"I only want to squirm." 
And he dropped his wings dejectedly, 

But still his voice was firm; 
"I do not want to be a fly, 

I want to be a worm." 

yesterday of unknown lack, 
Today of unknown bliss; 

1 left my fool in red and black; 
The last I saw was this, 

The creature madly climbing back 
Into his chrysalis. 

This parable needs no comment. We are in its 
debt, if it leads us to conclude that wherever we 
go we are not going backwards. This is the age 
of the flying machine. We are not going to scrap 
the machinery produced by the industrial revolution, 
as Ruskin and Carlyle thought we ought to do. It 



120 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

was not the fault of the machinery, but the use we 
made of it. We intend to liberate modern industry 
from the dead chrysalis forms of the past, so that 
it may use its wings to fly into the free air and 
sunshine of a new and joyous enterprise. Industry 
which has sorely crippled the nation will yet be one 
of the nation's saviours, perhaps its greatest. 

I would beg my reader, therefore, to go into the 
next part of the discussion with an open mind, 
willing to be disturbed, unafraid of new ideas. I 
would say both to managers and men, what Oliver 
Cromwell once said to the members of the British 
Parliament: "I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies 
of Christ, to believe it is possible for you to be 
mistaken." 

"Robinson Crusoe" not only challenges modern 
industry at its crucial point of weakness, but also 
supplies the remedy for it, the only remedy there 
is. To state what the remedy is and how it is 
applied is the purpose of the next Part. 



PART III 

HOW ROBINSON CRUSOE SOLVES THE 
LABOR PROBLEM 



The final test of any nation is in the opportunity it gives 
its average man, and still more in the fitness of the average 
man to grasp the opportunity. 

DAVID STARR JORDAN. 



PART III 

HOW ROBINSON CRUSOE SOLVES THE 
LABOR PROBLEM 



CHAPTER I 

POLITICS AND INDUSTRY 

TTOW to secure concerted action in the whole 
* * and at the same time preserve autonomy in 
the individual parts this is our central social prob- 
lem, whether it emerges in politics, or religion, or 
economics. In the political world there is constant 
conflict between the governors and the governed. 
How to insure peaceful concerted action in the 
nation and autonomy in the units, which compose it; 
how a nation can be strong enough to preserve 
itself without destroying personal liberty, that is 
the political problem and always has been from the 
beginning of recorded history. In the family, the 
ancient authority of the father over his children 
and the husband over his wife has been greatly 
weakened and in some nations altogether destroyed. 
How to reconcile the moral rights of woman and 

123 



124 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the freedom of her personality with the unity neces- 
sary to ordered family life, that is the social prob- 
lem. In industry the conflict between capital, which 
is accumulated wealth, and labor as a mental proc- 
ess, which is the creator of wealth, is acute. Work- 
men no longer are willing to be slaves of capital, 
but demand their freedom. How to reconcile the 
freedom of workmen with the necessity for con- 
certed industrial action, that is the industrial 
problem. 

The principle, which constitutes the problem in 
each case, is exactly the same. It is the science 
and art of community organization. Our familiar- 
ity with this problem in politics and religion has 
equipped us with the ability to recognize it as an 
old friend, now that it has emerged with glaring 
intensity in the industrial field. The paramount 
problem of the present day is the industrial problem, 
but it is a new staging of an old and irrepressible 
issue. Achille Loria maintains that there is today 
no religious question and no political question, but 
only the economic question. It is true that the re- 
ligious question is not the same as it was when the 
church tried to stifle thought, to combat scientific 
investigation and to exercise temporal authority. 
Likewise the political question is not the same as 
it was when democratic aspirations waged war 
against the tyranny of kings, and when defenseless 
people were held in open slavery. In religion and 
politics certain crude battles have been fought and 



POLITICS AND INDUSTRY 125 

won; a certain achievement has been made, which 
has not yet been made in economics. It is, there- 
fore, obvious that the economic question is now 
the burning question in a sense in which religion and 
politics are no longer burning questions. 

It is not fair to the facts and it would be a 
profound mistake to suppose that there is no longer 
a political question or a religious question. They 
exist in different forms and stages of development, 
but they still exist, and are more persistent and 
challenging than heretofore. It would be nearer 
the truth to say that these questions had entered 
the economic field and that all three questions had 
become merged, only with the economic face of it 
to the forefront. The three basic questions of 
perennial interest to human welfare are politics, 
religion and economics. ( What is now happening 
is that we are discovering that they constitute one 
and the same question. ) 

When Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation 
raised four million creatures from the status of chat- 
tels to the status of human beings, what was that, 
an economic, or political, or religious act? It was 
obviously all three. It was economic, for it revolu- 
tionized the form of labor. It was political, for it 
was achieved through governmental machinery. It 
was religious, for it righted a glaring human wrong, 
and without the impetus of the religious sentiment 
it could never had been achieved. It is no more 
possible to separate the three elements of this prob- 



126 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

lem, than it would be possible to separate oxygen 
and hydrogen and still have water. 

James Russell Lowell once wrote the following 
"Parable": 

Said Christ our Lord, "I will go and see 
How the men, my brethren, believe in me." 
He passed not again through the gate of birth, 
But made himself known to the children of earth. 

Then said the chief priests, and rulers, and kings, 
"Behold, now, the Giver of all good things; 
Go to, let us welcome with pomp and state 
Him who alone is mighty and great." 

With carpets of gold the ground they spread 

Wherever the Son of Man should tread; 

And in palace-chambers lofty and rare 

They lodged him, and served him with kingly fare. 

Great organs surged through arches dim 
Their jubilant floods in praise of him; 
And in church, and palace, and judgment-hall, 
He saw his own image high over all. 

But still, wherever his steps they led, 
The Lord in sorrow bent down his head; 
And from under the heavy foundation-stones 
The Son of Mary heard bitter groans. 

And in church, and palace, and judgment-hall, 
He marked great fissures that rent the wall, 
And opened wider and yet more wide 
As the living foundation heaved and sighed. 



POLITICS AND INDUSTRY 127 

"Have you founded your thrones and altars, then, 
On the bodies and souls of living men? 
And think ye that building shall endure 
Which shelters the noble and crushes the poor? 

"With gates of silver and bars of gold 

Ye have fenced my sheep from their Father's fold ; 

I have heard the dropping of their tears 

In heaven these eighteen hundred years." 

"O Lord and Master, not ours the guilt, 
We built but as our fathers built; 
Behold thine images, how they stand, 
Sovereign and sole, through all our land. 

"Our task is hard with sword and flame 
To hold thine earth forever the same, 
And with sharp crooks of steel to keep 
Still, as thou leftest them, thy sheep." 

Then Christ sought out an artisan, 
A low-browed, stunted, haggard man, 
And a motherless girl, whose ringers thin 
Pushed from her faintly want and sin. 

These set he in the midst of them, 
And as they drew back their garment-hem, 
For fear of defilement, "Lo, here," said he, 
"The images ye have made of me!" 

When he wrote this parable, did Lowell speak 
as a prophet or a statesman? Obviously as both. 
The type of human product society manufactures 
admittedly is the concern of religion. Is it any the 



128 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

less the concern of a nation? The making of men 
and women is the chief business of the nation. 
"The low-browed, stunted, haggard man," is he 
a fit man to exercise the franchise ? Can such men 
exercise the franchise intelligently? And yet his 
right to vote makes him the creator of legislators 
and public policies. Is it not clear that, in propor- 
tion as this type of man multiplies, the foundation 
of the nation is built on sand and confronted with 
the ever-present possibility of crumbling? 

The reason that the political question has been 
merged in the economic question is the discovery 
that there can be no political democracy in fact 
unless there is also industrial democracy. When- 
ever one group of men acquires great wealth and 
becomes economically strong, and another group 
becomes economically weak, the strong group will 
always control the machinery of government and 
dictate laws to protect their own interests. Oliver 
Cromwell once wrote to Parliament: "If there be 
any one that makes many poor to make a few rich, 
that suits not a commonwealth." It not only does 
not suit a commonwealth, but it makes a common- 
wealth in any true sense impossible. In 1890 one 
per cent, of the families of the country, owned one 
half of the aggregate wealth of the country, more 
than all the rest of the nation put together! Ac- 
cording to the 1910 census the distribution of wealth 
is still more unequal, so much so as to be alarming. 
Nine-tenth's of one per cent, of the population owns 



POLITICS AND INDUSTRY 129 

seventy per cent, of the wealth. The figures are as 
follows : 

POPULATION AGGREGATE WEALTH 

00.9 per cent, owns 70.5 per cent. 

29.0 per cent, owns 25.3 per cent. 

70.1 per cent, owns 4.2 per cent. 



100.0 100.0 

The enormous increase in the ownership of 
wealth by the few and decrease in ownership by 
the many is significant not only because of the 
physical hardship entailed. It is spiritually disturb- 
ing as well. The fact is disturbing enough; the 
cause of it is still more so. It is because industrial 
conditions make it increasingly difficult for the many 
to use their thinking powers. Inequality of oppor- 
tunity, denial of the chance to be creative workmen 
and produce what they have the power to produce, 
this is the real point of distress in the problem. 

Similar inequality in the exercise of power is 
exhibited in another phase of the problem. It is 
idle to suppose that this group of one per cent, 
will be content with one per cent, of the political 
power. As a matter of fact, they have not been. 
They have bought and sold legislation as they would 
cotton cloth. 

When an effort was made to have enacted in 
Albany the Mercantile Inspection Law, a humane 
law to provide sanity accommodations and seats for 



130 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

female clerks in New York department stores, the 
bill was defeated for several years by a lobby 
of merchants. During that period many articles 
against it appeared in a certain New York news- 
paper, and orders were sent down from the count- 
ing-room of this same newspaper to permit no 
article in its favor to appear, and such articles were 
therefore rejected. Thomas Jefferson well said that 
"when newspapers are controlled by money, then 
they are a most dangerous factor in a republic." 
When this bill was finally passed in spite of oppo- 
sition, its same enemies so thwarted its administra- 
tion that it speedily became a dead letter. When- 
ever selfish special interests dominate the making 
of laws, thwart their administration and distort in- 
telligent public opinion, then political democracy 
ceases to exist. 

The illustration of this fact used by Rauschen- 
busch is the interference of President Roosevelt in 
the great coal strike a few years ago, which was 
hailed as a demonstration that the people are still 
supreme, but which he thinks rather demonstrated 
that the supremacy of the people is almost gone. 
The country was on the verge of a vast public 
calamity. A sudden cold snap would have sent 
death through our eastern cities, not with his old 
fashioned scythe, but with a modern reaper. The 
president merely undertook to advise and persuade, 
and was met with an almost insolent rejoinder. 
Jacob A. Riis said that the president when he con- 






POLITICS AND INDUSTRY 131 

eluded to interfere, set his face grimly, and said, 
u Yes, I will do it. I suppose that ends me; but it 
is right and I will do it." The governor of Massa- 
chusetts afterward sent him "the thanks of every 
man, woman and child in the country." The pres- 
ident replied: "Yes, we have put it through. But, 
heavens and earth ! It has been a struggle." What 
is this sinister power, whose selfish interests can 
take precedence over the safety of the people, so 
that a common-sense action by the first officer of 
the nation is likely to bring upon him political ruin? 
Is there an invisible government back of the govern- 
ment at Washington which can prevent it from 
rendering public service? 

It is clear that economic inequalities naturally 
produce political inequalities. There can never be 
any political democracy as long as pure patriotic 
sentiments are replaced by selfish economic interests. 
A political democracy can exist only where there is 
either approximate economic equality, or else where 
economic inequality is regulated by a stronger, 
nobler spirit than self-interest. That stronger, 
nobler spirit is industrial democracy. 

It is clear then that the political, religious and 
economic problems can no longer be kept separate 
from each other in air-tight compartments. When- 
ever an issue is raised or solved in any one of them 
it is only a question of time when it will emerge 
in the others also. And this is what has now hap- 
pened the world over in dramatic fashion. 






132 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

At the time when workmen had no standing in 
the law they lived in a state of vassalage and were 
treated as things. They were denied the right to 
own property and as a consequence they owned 
none. As long as the facts of their condition and 
their legal status harmonized, the economic problem 
was practically non-existent. But now universal 
equality before the law is an accomplished and 
recognized fact. This achievement gave them the 
right to own property. It admitted them not only 
to equal private rights, but equal public rights, which 
included the right 'to vote. 

But the theoretic equality of all men before the 
law was contradicted by a striking inequality in 
actual condition. The worker's status politically 
was in irreconcilable conflict with his status indus- 
trially. Why grant him an equality of opportunity 
in political life and deny the same thing in economic 
life? It raises an irrepressible issue. Political 
democracy and industrial autocracy cannot both exist 
for long in the same nation. The same man cannot 
long continue to be half free and half slave ; a poli- 
tical freeman and an industrial slave. When the 
American Revolutionary War was fought to achieve 
equality of opportunity for self-development, it is 
only natural to expect that the same principle then 
contested in politics would sooner or later be con- 
tested in economics. That time has now fully come. 

It is highly important to remember that the eco- 
nomic problem now insistently clamoring for solu- 



POLITICS AND INDUSTRY 133 

tion, is the same problem we have already faced in 
American politics. We met it once; we can do it 
again. There is, therefore, no occasion to get 
scared or to get mad. In the beginning of our 
history we faced the difficult task of securing con- 
certed action in the whole without infringing upon 
individual freedom in the parts. These two prin- 
ciples were the subject of a long and heated con- 
troversy. Jefferson stood for local autonomy 
Hamilton for federal power. It was a royal con- 
test and one of vast importance to the future welfare 
of the country. Both men were in Washington's 
cabinet, but they became political, then personal 
enemies. If we inquire which won in this contest 
the answer must be both. Hamilton won first 
Jefferson won last and permanently. But when he 
became president he did not undo the work of his 
great rival, for he recognized its merits. Both men 
were ardent patriots, and idealists. The pity of it 
is that they failed to understand each other, failed 
to see that the common welfare requires the union 
of the two principles for which they separately 
contended. 

It is not a question of "either-or," but a question 
of "both-and." The economic problem like the po- 
litical problem and every other great question, has 
two sides to it which are opposite but not contradic- 
tory. In the continued and successful adjustment of 
the two sides of the political problem, America has 
made a larger contribution towards its solution than 






134 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

has been made by any other nation. Her great 
national tradition will inspire her to do the same 
in the economic field. She will proceed to eliminate 
the contradiction between her democratic political 
ideals and her industrial practice. She will create 
a new industrial America. 



CHAPTER II 

FRACTIONIZING A MAN 

/ ~P V O remember America's achievement in politics 
* will assist in discovering the direction in which 
a solution is to be found for the industrial problem. 
But if we are ever to find the solution, it is impera- 
tive that we keep clearly in mind the exact nature 
of the problem. In the previous chapters we an- 
alyzed the origin and nature of the problem. We 
must now restate it in terms of its solution. In the 
second part we found that the critical blunder of 
modern industry is its treatment of labor as a com- 
modity. We discovered that while modern business 
has made an extraordinary exhibit of mechanical 
and scientific intelligence, it has made also an ex- 
traordinary exhibit of the lack of social intelligence. 
But when we conclude that labor is not a commodity, 
that is only a start towards a solution. It tells us 
only what labor is not; it does not tell us what 
labor is. 

True, the incontestable statement that labor is 
not a commodity, while it ought never to have 
needed saying, nevertheless in view of the past in- 
dustrial barbarism, is a grave and beautiful step in 
advance. October 15, 1914, is a date worthy of 

135 



136 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

remembrance and joyous celebration. On that day 
the Clayton amendment to the Anti-Trust law was 
adopted by the American Congress. It contained 
the statement that, u the labor of a human being is 
not a commodity or article of commerce." It is 
the first time in history that this sentiment was ever 
expressed in law by any legislative assembly. The 
protest of the representatives of Alsace-Lorraine 
delivered in Berlin February 18, 1874, expressed 
the same sentiment in the following words: "Citi- 
zens possessed of souls and of intelligence are not 
merchandise to be traded, and therefore it is not 
lawful to make them the subject of a contract." 
But the American Congress is the first national legis- 
lature to express this ideal in terms of law. 

It is significant of much, that this sentiment should 
have gotten itself thus officially expressed. But it 
is only the merest beginning, and even as a begin- 
ning it is one thing to express it in words and quite 
a different thing to operate it in practice. When 
I ask you, how many workmen are there in your 
factory? Do you not still answer, Two hundred 
hands? That's what is wrong with your factory. 
You are working with pieces of men instead of with 
whole men. That is why you are getting only a 
fraction of the production you should be getting. 

This is what is the matter with the whole indus- 
trial world. It has fractionized the workmen. It 
has severed the connection between a man's hand 
and his brain and heart. This is the basic cause 



FRACTIONIZING A MAN 137 

of industrial unrest. The remedy for it is to remove 
the cause. The problem before modern industry is 
to discover how it can restore this connection, so 
that head, heart, and hand will be concerted for 
productive purposes. When this is done, the indus- 
trial problem will be solved and cease to exist. It 
can easily be done, if there is a desire to do it. 

There is no hope of ever finding a solution un- 
less we clearly perceive and once for all eliminate 
the organic error, which still continues to blind the 
leaders of modern industry to facts as they are. In 
our thought and speech and action, we classify capi- 
tal and labor together as if they were the same kind 
of thing, whereas they are essentially different. One 
is a thing, the other is not a thing at all. Capital 
is a thing, like land, or a house, or an engine, or a 
gold dollar. It is an article, an instrument, a tool, 
a symbol of exchange. But labor is not a thing, it 
is the creative activity of the brain and heart and 
nerves of a human being. To classify it with capi- 
tal is a stark contradiction of the fact and a stupid 
blunder. To include capital and labor as like fac- 
tors, in the same equation of our industrial problem 
is like the attempt to add together three quarts of 
milk and three-quarters of a mile. The thing can't 
be done. To attempt a solution of the labor prob- 
lem on this basis is to attempt the impossible. And 
yet there are men who try to do it, and the men who 
are trying it have appropriated to themselves the 
term "practical." Capital should be classified with 



138 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

wages. They are the same kind of thing and should 
be treated exactly alike in every respect. When we 
have done that, we have arranged a subordinate 
factor in industry. An important factor, it is true, 
but still only a subordinate and mechanical factor. 
The real labor problem lies outside of either wages 
or capital. Labor belongs in a wholly different 
category. 

There are three distinct stages in the evolution 
of our thought about labor, through which we must 
pass before we arrive at a knowledge of the fact. 
Since there is no labor apart from human activity, 
let us for the sake of brevity and clarity substitute 
the word "man" for labor. 

The first stage is to regard man as a commodity. 
The accompaniment of this conception is slavery. 
We have partially outgrown this conception. The 
second stage is to regard man as an animal. The 
accompaniment of this conception is a bare living 
wage, just enough to keep the animal alive, and 
charity in case of extreme need. So long as indus- 
try is organized in such a way as to permit men to 
function only as animals, both the economic law and 
the spiritual law will prevent them from receiving 
more than the bare cost of their living. When men 
go on the assumption that they are animals, that's 
the way they will act and live. It's an inescapable 
result of the pig-trough philosophy. With this con- 
ception sometimes goes, and more and more fre- 
quently, the effort to provide comfortable working 



FRACTIONIZING A MAN 139 

conditions, and even good food. This is all very 
well and quite natural. It is the way we would 
treat a mule, if we exercised good business sense. 
If we wanted to get efficient results from the mule, 
it would be wise to watch after his food, and pay 
some attention to his physical condition. 

Nothing should be more obvious than that we 
must outgrow these two conceptions; that a work- 
man is neither a commodity, nor an animal. It is 
likewise obvious that the day for charity is gone 
by and must be discarded together with the con- 
ception that gave it birth. Help in emergencies is 
not charity, but comradeship. As a policy, charity 
is a degradation, both to giver and receiver. At 
the best it is only a palliative, not a cure. It is not 
palliatives, but preventions, that justice demands. 
The only wise charity after all is justice. The at- 
tempt to substitute charity for justice is an insult. 
The Hebrew language has no separate word for 
charity. Its word for justice is the symbol for both 
ideas. When every language employs the same 
word for justice and charity alike, it will be the sure 
sign that the practice of justice has dispensed with 
the need for charity. 

When we have outgrown these two conceptions, 
then we are in a position to see the fact and under- 
stand that a workman is not a hand, not a com- 
modity, not an animal; he is a soul, that is, a man. 
But what is a man and how should a man be treated? 
If we can find a true answer to these questions, we 



140 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

can solve the labor question; otherwise not. It's 
a long distance from a commodity to a soul, but it's 
the distance we must travel, if we ever expect to 
find a solution of our problem. 



CHAPTER III 

MAN AS A "TIME-BINDER" 

f^HE labor problem centers in the man, who 
* labors. He is the big factor in economics, the 
Hamlet of the industrial drama. Leaders of mod- 
ern industry have displayed extraordinary ingenuity 
and inventive genius in the development of machi- 
nery and the perfection of methods. It is difficult 
to explain why they have made almost no attempt 
to understand the human machine, the basic element 
in their whole enterprise. 

If I were intending to deal with a mule, and ex- 
pected him to work rather than to kick, it is impor- 
tant that I make a careful study of the complexities 
of mule nature. If I am to get the best results 
from a steam engine, I must inform myself about 
its mechanism, and the science and art essential to 
its efficient operation. If, likewise, I want satis- 
factory results from the most complex and highly 
organized instrument in the universe, the human 
creator of wealth, I must know its psychology. Just 
as my treatment of a steam engine must be in har- 
mony with the principles on which it is constructed, 
so my treatment of a man must be in harmony with 
the principles of human nature. If I cannot get 

141 



142 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

good results by treating him like a man, it is quite 
certain I cannot by treating him like a dog, or 
worse still, like a commodity. This seems too ob- 
vious to need stating. But it must be stated and 
re-stated, because it is the one thing we have most 
neglected. The obvious is always the last thing 
discovered. For the past one hundred fifty years, 
we have addressed ourselves seriously to every ele- 
ment in industry, except the one most needful. 
Socrates said, "The true politics is first of all a 
politics of the soul." The first business of any 
enterprise dependent, as modern industry is, on free 
co-operation, is to understand the psychology of the 
co-operators, to know what human nature is and 
how to treat it. 

Inasmuch as this is the key to the solution of the 
economic problem, let us have the courage to come 
to grips with it. Let me ask you factory owners 
and captains of industry a challenging question, and 
insist on an honest answer. It is this. What can 
you do with these workmen that will do you any 
good? They annoy you, make you mad, do selfish 
and stupid things, just as you do. But in view of 
all the facts, whatever they may be, what can you 
do with them that will do you any good? Let us 
suggest some answers. 

You might kill them. That has frequently been 
done in the past, legally and illegally. But that will 
do you no good, because then you would not have 
men to run your factories and create your wealth. 



MAN AS A "TIME-BINDER" 143 

You might hate them. That is a very common 
practice. But it will do you no good, because it 
produces open strikes, and stops production, or it 
produces silent strikes and decreases production. 

I request my reader to lay down the book at this 
point, and build up a series of answers, as many 
as he likes, and critically examine them. I challenge 
you to be honest. If you are, you will be compelled 
to discard every answer excepting one. What is 
that? 

Well, I am embarrassed to say it. The thing 
itself is quite simple and clear. What embarrasses 
me is the lack of a word, which will carry it to you 
accurately. We will have to try several terms until 
we find one which makes the idea clear. Assuming 
that your sense of fair play will induce you to read 
this chapter through, in order to discover my mean- 
ing, I will dare to use the word I like best, but which 
is the most misunderstood. The one thing, and the 
only thing, you can do with these workmen that will 
do you any good, is to love them. 

You're shocked? I thought you would be. I 
realize the risk I run in using this word, for no one 
knows what it means. Like the words "politics" 
and "religion," the word "love" has been ruined. 
It means everything and nothing. It means anything 
you want to make it mean. To me it means some- 
thing very definite, but what it means in the minds 
of my readers, I have no means of knowing. Let 
us, therefore, give it a content, so we can continue- 






144 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

with the discussion. In my thought, love stands for 
two basic ideas, riveted together; voluntary justice 
and intelligent sympathy. 

With this definite content for the term "love" 
clearly in mind, please do not suppose that I am 
talking about a sentiment. I'm doing nothing of 
the kind. I'm talking about mathematics, a rigidly 
accurate statement of fact; a scientific law of eco- 
nomics. A man is the kind of creature that de- 
mands to be treated on the basis of the law of love 
or he will make trouble. His psychology requires 
it. The application of this law will solve every 
troublesome question in industry and do it in such 
a way that it will stay solved. 

Inasmuch as this is an audacious suggestion, 
audacious because of its simplicity, let us support it 
by testimony of witnesses, who have thought deeply 
on the subject, and whose insight is everywhere 
acknowledged. Witness Tolstoi, who said: "Men 
may saw wood and hammer iron without love, but 
they cannot handle men without love; you cannot 
handle the honey bee as you would wood and iron 
without injury to both yourself and the bee." 

Witness one of the keenest thinkers and wisest 
reformers of his day Jeremy Bentham, who said: 
"The way to be comfortable is to make others com- 
fortable. The way to make others comfortable is 
to appear to love them. The way to appear to love 
them is to love them in reality." 






MAN AS A "TIME-BINDER" 145 

Witness Whitman, who said : 

Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice, 

Be not dishearten'd Affection shall solve the problems of 

Freedom yet. 

Were you looking to be held together by the lawyers? 
Or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms? 
Nay nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere. 

The demonstrated futility of force in any form, 
the repeated failure of agreements on paper, ought 
long ago to have persuaded us to conclude that liv- 
ing things can cohere only on the principle suggested 
by Whitman. 

Witness the dying words of Albert Grey, who 
had spent his life in practical work for the co-opera- 
tive movement : u You know the idea of those words 
'he being dead yet speaketh' ? A voice from the 
dead often gets a hearing. That's what I'm after. 
I want you to make my voice sound from the grave. 
I want to say to the people, there is a real way out 
of this mess materialism has got us into. I've been 
trying to tell them so for thirty years. It's Christ's 
way. Mazzini saw it. We've got to give up quar- 
reling. We've got to come together. We've got 
to realize we're all members of one family. There's 
nothing can help humanity I'm perfectly sure there 
isn't perfectly sure except love. Love's the way 
out and the way up. That's my farewell to the 
world." 

Witness Emerson: "In his lecture on 'Man the 
Reformer' which was read before the Mechanics' 






146 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

Apprentices' Association in Boston in January, 
1841," said Charles W. Eliot, "Emerson described 
in the clearest manner the approaching strife be- 
tween laborers and employers, between poor and 
rich, and pointed out the cause of this strife in the 
selfishness, unkindness and mutual distrust which 
ran through the community. He also described, 
with perfect precision, the only ultimate remedy 
namely, the sentiment of love. 'Love would put a 
new face on this weary old world in which we dwell 
as pagans and enemies too long. The virtue of this 
principle in human society in application to great 
interests is obsolete and forgotten. But one day 
all men will be lovers; and every calamity will be 
dissolved in the universal sunshine.' It is more than 
sixty years since those words were uttered, and in 
those years society has had large experience of in- 
dustrial and social strife, of its causes and conse- 
quences, and of many attempts to remedy or soften 
it; but all this experience only goes to show that 
there is but one remedy for these ills. It is to be 
found in kindness, good fellowship, and the affec- 
tions. In Emerson's words, 'We must be lovers, 
and at once the impossible becomes possible.' The 
world will wait long for this remedy, but there is 
no other." 

Emerson is quite correct in believing that there 
is no other remedy, and the pressure of economic 
necessity will lead the world to accept it sooner 
than he supposed they would. There is a marked 



MAN AS A "TIME-BINDER" 147 

desire now in many quarters to understand what 
it is. I fear that the flavor still clinging to the 
word "love" will betray many into regarding it as 
a sentiment rather than as an organic law of life. 

It is difficult even to use the term "Golden Rule," 
although it stands for a much smaller idea than the 
principle we are discussing. It is commonly sup- 
posed that the Golden Rule is an exalted standard 
in the Christian view of life. But it is far from 
being the Christian's ideal. It is no more than a 
simple rule of justice, ancient and widely recog- 
nized. Jesus stated it as the standard of justice 
set up in Judaism. His rule of life went far beyond 
it. With him it was not equality of service but self- 
sacrificing service. Being no more than a simple 
rule of justice, it ought not to be difficult to accept 
the Golden Rule as a law of economics. 

No one will assert that a man like Henry George 
was a sentimentalist. He was an exact scientist, so 
exact that it was said in the preface to the last edi- 
tion of his book, "Progress and Poverty," what 
probably has never been said of any book, namely, 
that no objection or criticism of any detail of it had 
yet appeared which was not anticipated and an- 
swered in the book itself. Mr. George makes this 
significant statement about the Golden Rule : "The 
more you study this question the more you will see 
that the true law of social life is the law of love, 
the law of liberty, the law of each for all and all 
for each; that the golden rule of morals is also the 






148 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

golden rule of the science of wealth; that the high- 
est expressions of religious truth include the widest 
generalizations of political economy." 

Nevertheless on account of the handicap now 
resting on the word "love" and on the term "Golden 
Rule," let us state the same thing in different terms. 
We are discussing a law of economics, which is also 
a sentiment and as such is a creative element in 
industry. But in order to get away as far as pos- 
sible from the suggestion of dealing with a senti- 
ment alone let us state it in terms of mathematics, 
that is, in the exact terms of rigorous thinking. 

When we say that the only thing you can do with 
workmen, that will do you any good, is to love them 
love them, mark you, not for their sakes but for 
your own the statement is accurate enough. But 
it is not generally recognized as accurate. The 
language of mathematics is. It is the science of 
necessary conclusions. Therefore, let us say that 
the only thing you can do with a workman, that will 
do you any good, is to treat him like a man. This 
seems definite enough, but it isn't. We must ob- 
viously make the further inquiry, what is a man, 
else how shall we know what treatment is appro- 
priate for him? This seems like an easy question, 
but it isn't. We have been asking it for centuries. 

One day on the streets of Athens, Aristotle was 
walking, so absorbed in his own thinking, that un- 
intentionally he ran into a young man coming rap- 
idly from the opposite direction. The impact 



MAN AS A "TIME-BINDER" 149 

dislodged the young man's hat and also his dignity. 
Being a well-dressed and self-conscious young gen- 
tleman, he was much annoyed. He expressed him- 
self in vigorous terms, ending his complaint of the 
unknown stranger's carelessness with the question, 
"Who are you, anyway?" To this the great phi- 
losopher answered, "My friend, I would give 
worlds, if I knew the answer to your question." A 
clear answer was made to it about two thousand 
years ago by the greatest democrat in history, but 
His teaching has been so obscured and distorted, 
that his answer cannot with safety be used in this 
connection. We must therefore, seek a statement 
of His answer in modern scientific terms. 

Fortunately a book has this year appeared, which 
does this service for us. It is "Manhood of Hu- 
manity," by Count Alfred Korzybski, a mathema- 
tician. It was written to say one thing, but that 
one thing is so simple, so profound, so creative in 
its effects, so far-reaching in its implications, and 
all said so impressively, that the reader is at once 
under profound and personal obligation to the au- 
thor for saying it. It is an idea, which can only 
be described as a rare illumination shedding light 
on a dozen perplexities at one flash. One's only 
regret in reading the book is that he shall never 
again enjoy the thrill of reading it for the first time. 

The author's aim is to do, what he says has never 
before been done, namely, accurately define what a 
man is. His golden definition of a man is that he 






150 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

is "a time-binder." This is not a theory, but the 
statement, in mathematical terms, of a fact newly 
discovered. It is man's distinguishing mark that 
he belongs to the time-binding class of life. A plant 
appropriates one kind of energy, converts it into 
another and stores it up. It is a storage battery 
for solar energy. Plants are defined as the energy- 
binding class of life. An animal uses the plants as 
food, which in animals undergo a further transfor- 
mation into higher forms. The animal has freedom 
and power. He lives and acts and moves about in 
space. Animals are defined as the space-binding 
class of life. But man, while he has the space-bind- 
ing capacity, has also a remarkable capacity peculiar 
to himself. He appropriates the labors of the past, 
uses past experiences as spiritual capital for develop- 
ment in the present, is regulated by inherited wis- 
dom, makes the past live in the present and the 
present for the future, is the inheritor of by-gone 
ages, the trustee of posterity. A human being is 
defined as the time-binding class of life. If he 
wants to use an idea, he can go back to his child- 
hood for it, or go back to his father for it, or go 
back to Plato for it. He is, as Emerson said, a 
quotation from his ancestors. Man looks before 
and after, said Shelley, and pines for what is not. 

The picture of Robinson Crusoe writing in his 
Journal, is a significant picture of the universal and 
essential nature of man. Why does this man, con- 
tending alone upon an island with the raw materials 



MAN AS A "TIME-BINDER" 151 

of nature for a bare existence, feel the necessity of 
keeping a journal to connect himself with the past 
and the future? The reason is obvious. He is a 
time-binder. An animal keeps no journal; a time- 
binder does. 

This conception of man, which Count Korzybski 
has illuminated and made to live, is revolutionary 
in its transforming effect in many fields of thought 
and activity. By calling a man a time-binder, we 
center attention on his essential and distinguishing 
characteristic. He is a mind, a spirit, a creator, a 
time-binder. He must be treated for what he is. 
It becomes at once obvious that a creature of this 
kind cannot be transformed into a machine, a cog 
in a wheel, a commodity, an animal. As soon as 
such an attempt is made, there occurs inside of him 
a civil war, which gives him no peace. That he 
rebels against it and goes on strike is not his fault, 
but God's, for God made him to be a time-binder. 
A time-binder cannot consent with himself to be an 
animal or to be treated as one. He may be tempted 
into a bargain to sell his soul for a mess of pottage, 
but the bargain can never be final. The stars in 
their courses are against it. 

Whether we say that a workman is a soul and 
must be loved, or whether we prefer the language 
of mathematics and say that he is an exponential 
function of time and must be treated like a man, 
it makes no difference, provided we think in terms 
of the fact itself. It is highly significant that a man 






152 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

like Korzybski, starting from the standpoint of 
mathematics and thinking in exact terms, and we 
starting from the standpoint of the social sciences 
and thinking in terms of human welfare, have ar- 
rived at exactly the same point, and stand with 
reverence before the same illuminating fact, which 
we agree is the only possible way of escape for 
modern industry. This is unsolicited confirmation 
of one science by another. When men of different 
sciences see deep enough and think in terms of fact 
instead of theory, they unexpectedly discover that 
their feet are planted on the same path. 

This fact is so central in any attempted solution 
of the economic problem, that for the sake of added 
emphasis and clarity, I state it in terms of a Socratic 
dialogue, which is at once popular and precise : 

DIALOGUE 

SOCRATES ALCIBIADES 

Soc. Hold, now, with whom do you at present con- 
verse? Is it not with me? 

ALC. Yes. 

Soc. And I also with you? 

ALC. Yes. 

Soc. It is Socrates then who speaks? 

ALC. Assuredly. 

Soc. And Alcibiades who listens? 

ALC. Yes. 

Soc. Is it not with language that Socrates speaks? 

ALC. What, now? Of course. 

Soc. To converse and to use language, are not, then, 
these the same? 



MAN AS A "TIME-BINDER" 153 

ALC. The very same. 

Soc. But he who uses a thing and the thing used Are 
these not different? 

ALC. What do you mean? 

Soc. A currier does he not use a cutting knife and 
other instruments? 

ALC. Yes. 

Soc. And the man who uses a cutting knife, is he dif- 
ferent from the instrument he uses? 

ALC. Most certainly. 

Soc. In like manner, the lyrist, is he not different from 
the lyre he plays on? 

ALC. Undoubtedly. 

Soc. This, then, is what I asked you just now does not 
he who uses a thing seem to you always different from the 
thing used? 

ALC. Very different. 

Soc. But the currier, does he cut with his instruments 
alone, or also with his hands? 

ALC. Also with his hands. 

Soc. He then uses his hands? 

ALC. Yes. 

Soc. And in his work he uses also his eyes? 

ALC. Yes. 

Soc. We are agreed, then, that he who uses a thing, and 
the thing used, are different? 

ALC. We are. 

Soc. The currier and lyrist are, therefore, different from 
the hands and eyes with which they work ? 

ALC. So it seems. 

Soc. Now, then, does not a man use his whole body? 

ALC. Unquestionably. 

Soc. But we are agreed that he who uses and that which 
is used are different? 

ALC. Yes. 

Soc. A man is therefore different from his body? 



154 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

ALC. So I think. 

Soc. What, then, is the man? 

ALC. I cannot say. 

Soc. You can at least say that the man is that which 

uses the body? 

ALC. True. 

Soc. Now, does any thing use the body but the mind ? 

ALC. Nothing. 

Soc. The mind is therefore the man? 

ALC. The mind alone. 



CHAPTER IV 

A MAY-DAY PARTY 

TN the accurate terms of mathematics, the root 
cause of the disastrous civil war in modern in- 
dustry is the fact that both owners and workmen 
have acted like space-binders, that is, like animals, 
by which policy they have inflicted on themselves 
inexcusable losses and defeated even their own ani- 
mal purposes. The obvious solution is to remove 
the cause. This cause can only be removed by con- 
vincing both owners and men, that it is to their 
self-interest to abandon their present policy, and to 
substitute the policy of acting like time-binders, that 
is like brother men, allies in the same enterprise. 

The contrasted results issuing from the space- 
binding and time-binding policies are so tragically 
great, that the preference for the space-binding 
policy brings a serious indictment against the sanity 
of any men who choose it. This contrast has never 
been more clearly or briefly described than by the 
parable of a May-Day party in John Ruskin's Dub- 
lin address on "The Mystery of Life and Its Arts," 
which is probably the best document from his pen. 
Inasmuch as this is the most effective popular state- 
ment of this contrast anywhere in literature, so far 
as I know, I quote the parable in this connection: 

155 



156 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

"But there is yet a third class, to whom we may 
turn the wise practical men. Men, whose hearts 
and hopes are wholly in this present world, from 
whom, therefore, we may surely learn, at least, how, 
at present, conveniently to live in it. What will 
they say to us, or show us by example ? They know 
the world, surely; and what is the mystery of life 
to us, is none to them. They can surely show us 
how to live, while we live, and to gather out of 
the present world what is best. 

"I think I can best tell you their answer, by telling 
you a dream I had once. For though I am no poet, 
I have dreams sometimes : I dreamed I was at a 
child's May-Day party, in which every means of 
entertainment had been provided for them, by a 
wise and kind host. It was in a stately house, with 
beautiful gardens attached to it; and the children 
had been set free in the rooms and gardens, with 
no care whatever but how to pass their afternoon 
rejoicingly. They did not, indeed, know much about 
what was to happen next day; and some of them, 
I thought, were a little frightened, because there 
was a chance of their being sent to a new school 
where there were examinations; but they kept the 
thoughts of that out of their heads as well as they 
could, and resolved to enjoy themselves. The 
house, I said, was in a beautiful garden, and in the 
garden were all kinds of flowers; sweet, grassy 
banks for rest; and smooth lawns for play; and 
pleasant streams and woods; and rocky places for 



A MAY-DAY PARTY 157 

climbing. And the children were happy for a little 
while, but presently they separated themselves into 
parties; and then each party declared it would have 
a piece of the garden for its own, and that none of 
the others should have anything to do with that 
piece. Next, they quarreled violently which pieces 
they would have; and at last the boys took up the 
thing, as boys should do, 'practically,' and fought 
in the flower-beds till there was hardly a flower left 
standing; then they trampled down each other's 
bits of the garden out of spite; and the girls cried 
till they could cry no more ; and so they all lay down 
at last breathless in the ruin, and waited for the time 
when they were to be taken home in the evening. 

"Meanwhile, the children in the house had been 
making themselves happy also in their manner. 
For them, there had been provided every kind of 
indoor pleasure : there was music for them to dance 
to; and the library was open, with all manner of 
amusing books ; and there was a museum full of the 
most curious shells, and animals, and birds; and 
there was a workshop, with lathes and carpenters' 
tools, for the ingenious boys; and there were pretty 
fantastic dresses, for the girls to dress in; and there 
were microscopes, and kaleidoscopes; and whatever 
toys a child could fancy; and a table, in the dining- 
room, loaded with everything nice to eat. 

"But, in the midst of all this, it struck two or 
three of the more 'practical' children, that they 
would like some of the brass-headed nails that 



158 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

studded the chairs; and so they set to work to pull 
them out. Presently, the others, who were reading, 
or looking at shells, took a fancy to do the like ; and, 
in a little while, all the children, nearly, were sprain^ 
ing their fingers in pulling out brass-headed nails. 
With all that they could pull out, they were not satis- 
fied and then, everybody wanted some of somebody 
else's. And at last, the really practical and sensible 
ones declared, that nothing was of any real conse- 
quence, that afternoon, except to get plenty of brass- 
headed nails; and that the books, and the cakes, and 
the microscopes were of no use at all in themselves, 
but only, if they could be exchanged for nail-heads. 
And at last they began to fight for nail-heads, as 
the others fought for the bits of garden. Only here 
and there, a despised one shrank away into a corner, 
and tried to get a little quiet with a book, in the 
midst of the noise; but all the practical ones thought 
of nothing else but counting nail-heads all the after- 
noon even though they knew they would not be 
allowed to carry so much as one brass knob away 
with them. But no it was 'Who has most nails ? 
I have a hundred, and you have fifty; or, I have a 
thousand, and you have two. I must have as many 
as you before I leave the house, or I cannot pos- 
sibly go home in peace.' At last, they made so 
much noise that I awoke, and thought to myself, 
'What a false dream that is, of children/' The 
child is the father of the man; and wiser. Children 
never do such foolish things. Only men do." 



CHAPTER V 

WHOSE BUSINESS IS THIS? 

T5UT, argues the typical factory owner, does not 
^ the adoption of this manhood principle as a 
business policy mean a radical change in the organ- 
ization of modern business? Does it not mean, that 
I must put the creative impulses in the first place 
and the possessive impulses in the second place, that 
my aim would have to be production for use instead 
of production for profit, that I would have to square 
my business methods to the ideals of the community, 
which would thus attempt to interfere with my busi- 
ness? Whose business is this? Is it not my own? 
And is not private profit the only conceivable motive 
on which business can be conducted? I regard my 
business solely as a means of making money, and 
not as a public service enterprise. 

This is exactly the position taken by Marley in 
Dicken's Christmas Carol. He was a typical bus- 
iness man of his day, as you are of yours. This 
is the dominating opinion in the industrial and busi- 
ness world at present. A widely-used textbook on 
political economy, by a professor in a New Eng- 
land college, stated it as the accepted doctrine that 
"the ground on which men trade is self-interest," 

159 



160 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

and the author volunteered the further dogmatic 
opinion, that "no other motive is appropriate." 
College textbooks accurately reflect the common 
opinion, and this one may fairly be regarded as the 
characteristic business standard of our day. 

But when the ethical camouflage, which had dis- 
torted business for Marley, was removed, and he 
stood face to face with the naked and eternal facts 
as they are, his ghost by a strenuous effort came 
back to tell his skinflint partner, Scrooge, the great 
discovery he had made, namely: "Mankind was my 
business, the common welfare was my business." 
What he discovered was that legitimate business is 
not the pursuit of private interests only, but the 
supply of services for the satisfaction of human 
needs, that the golden rule is a law of economics. 
The issue you raise is precisely the issue between 
the conflicting points of view of the liberated Mar- 
ley, and the skinflint, Scrooge. It is a single, clear- 
cut, moral issue. No policy can be economically 
sound which is morally wrong. 

It is an irrepressible issue. Any attempt to side- 
step it will be futile. When you ask, "Whose busi- 
ness is this?" implying that it is your own, and you 
have the right to do as you please with it, we answer 
that your business is a community concern. Your 
right ends where injury from your business to com- 
munity begins. Crusoe was free to shoot in any 
direction on his island until Friday came. Then 
there was one direction in which he had no right 



WHOSE BUSINESS Is THIS? 161 

to shoot. His liberty ended where Friday's rights 
began. The private war between owners and work- 
men of a factory over a division of profits may and 
frequently does injure seriously the good name of 
a town and depreciate property values in the entire 
community. In such a case, the community has not 
only a right, but a duty, to bring pressure on both 
parties and compel them to end the conflict. 

What makes your business to be in particular a 
community concern is the fact that your workmen 
are also citizens. This is the significant thing, which 
has happened during the past one hundred fifty 
years, and it is this fact which constitutes the basic 
cause of the present industrial unrest throughout 
the world. If you will stop referring to your work- 
men as "numbers" or as "hands" and begin to ad- 
dress them as "Citizen Brown," "Citizen Jones," 
you will at once discover that you have raised the 
critical question confronting modern industry. It 
would no doubt be embarrassing, if some morning 
in a typical mill, the managers began to use the term 
"citizen" in addressing the workmen, because it 
would imply the necessity of installing a new method 
of treating this "citizen," if that is what he is. We 
have now arrived at the point where it is obvious 
that unrest in industry will never cease until we can 
call workmen "citizens" without embarrassment. 

The charter of our republic reads "We, the 
people." By it we did not mean "we, the farmers," 
or "we, the bankers," or "we, the laborers," or "we, 



162 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the capitalists." We meant "we, the people," that 
is, all of us, and our aim is to make this not a con- 
ventional phrase, but a spiritual and visible fact. 
We, the people, do not take sides in the civil war 
between owners and workmen. We take a side big- 
ger than either, that is, the side of the community; 
the public, which includes both of them. We, the 
people, therefore, have a stake in the workmen 
employed in your factory. Whatever its material 
prosperity may be, America as a society must be 
accounted a failure in so far as it does not afford 
every one of its members a chance to make a success 
of himself, because the making of men and women 
is the mission of America. We cannot stand by 
unconcerned and permit any factory to undo our 
work and dehumanize the men, whom it is our chief 
purpose to humanize. We cannot allow a citizen 
to be transformed into "a low-browed, stunted, hag- 
gard man." We must know whether your mill or 
mine is making or unmaking men. 

The chief danger arising from the use of machi- 
nery has consisted in its damage to human life. 
This danger is not decreasing, but increasing. Dur- 
ing the past twenty years, automatic tools and 
machinery have come into common use, especially 
in the making of automobiles. The automatic 
machine reduces the need for skill, produces little 
or no mental reaction, can be operated by a child 
as well as by an adult. Mr. Arthur Pound, who 
has written effectively about it in a recent Atlantic 



WHOSE BUSINESS Is THIS? 163 

Monthly, calls it "the Iron Man." The far-reach- 
ing effects of this iron man in the social and indus- 
trial world are serious and manifold. The particu- 
lar damage with which we are here concerned, is 
the deterioration produced in human nature. Mr. 
Pound graphically describes it in the following pas- 
sage: 

"The pockets of these children are full of money 
at an age when their fathers earned less than a 
living wage as apprentices. They are economically 
independent of home and social control. They have 
the eternal belief of youth that the preceding gen- 
eration is fossilized, and the buying power to act 
upon their belief. They are foot-loose to go wher- 
ever automatic machines are turning. They can 
buy their pleasures, and they do. They can afford 
to flout age and authority; they do. Their very 
active minds have no background, and feel the need 
of none. They have no conception of the cost of 
civilization; no standard of reference by which to 
judge social and political questions. They have not 
even lived long enough to learn the simple truth 
that common sense and wisdom spring from the 
same root. With far greater need for early thrift 
than their elders, because their effective economic 
life may be shorter, they spurn the homely virtue 
of economy. They buy pleasures, buy companions, 
buy glad raiment; they try desperately to buy 
happiness. And fail." 

The automatic machine is typical of our whole 



164 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

social order in its fundamental effect on the char- 
acter of our boys and girls, out of whom citizens 
are made. What it does is to make a radical change 
in their character, and not for the better. It has 
produced a new type of boy. It is the sensory 
type, instead of the motor type. That is, he is a 
boy whose senses are largely developed. He must 
have entertainment which appeals to his senses. He 
demands exciting pleasures. But his motor powers 
are weakened. He does not know how to use his 
will. He lacks individual initiative. Educators in 
preparatory schools and colleges are becoming seri- 
ously distressed over this type of character. He is 
the boy who will sit in the grandstand, but he will 
not play ball himself. He wants to be operated 
upon, but he himself will not operate. He is the 
type of boy who will by and by shun the respon- 
sibilities of marriage. They are too heavy for him. 
He has not been accustomed to bear responsibilities. 
He has been accustomed to having things done for 
him. He is over-socialized. He has too much 
environment. 

To stop this process of deterioration, a return 
must somehow be made to nature, to the soil, to a 
sense of reality acquired through a first hand con- 
tact with actualities. David Grayson in his "Adven- 
tures in Contentment" has well stated this defect 
of our modern life. "It comes to me," he says, 
"as the wonder of wonders, these spring days, how 
surely everything, spiritual as well as material, pro- 



WHOSE BUSINESS Is THIS? 165 

ceeds out of the earth. I have times of sheer Pa- 
ganism, when I could bow and touch my face to 
the warm bare soil. We are so often ashamed of 
the earth the soil of it, the sweat of it, the good 
common coarseness of it. To us in our fine raiment 
and soft manners, it seems indelicate. Instead of 
seeking that association with the earth, which is the 
renewal of life, we devise ourselves distant palaces 
and seek strange pleasures. How often and sadly 
we repeat the life story of the yellow dodder of the 
moist lanes of my lower farm. It springs up fresh 
and clean from the earth itself, and spreads its 
clinging viny stems over the hospitable wild balsam 
and golden rod. In a week's time, having reached 
the warm sunshine of the upper air, it forgets its 
humble beginnings. Its roots wither swiftly and 
die out, but the sickly yellow stems continue to flour- 
ish and spread, drawing their nourishment not from 
the soil itself, but by strangling and sucking the life 
juices of the hosts on which it feeds. I have seen 
whole byways covered thus with yellow dodder 
rootless, leafless, parasitic reaching up to the sun- 
light, quite cutting off and smothering the plants, 
which gave it life. A week or two it flourishes and 
then most of it perishes miserably. So many of us 
come to be like that; so much of our civilization is 
like that. Men and women there are the pity of 
it who, eating plentifully have never known a 
moment's real life of their own. Lying up to the 
sun in warmth and comfort but leafless they do 



166 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

not think of the hosts under them, smothered, stran- 
gled, starved. They take nothing at first hand. 
They experience described emotion, and think pre- 
pared thoughts. They live not in life, but in printed 
reports of life. They gather the odour of odours, 
not the odour itself; they do not hear, they over- 
hear. A poor, sad, second-rate existence." 

The natural tendency in the use of machinery 
reaches its climax in the automatic machine. The 
true order of things is reversed. The machine does 
not assist the workman; the workman assists the 
machine. It requires little skill, it calls forth no 
initiative, it produces a dodder type of man. Here 
again is exhibited the challenge, which "Robinson 
Crusoe" makes to modern industry, and which the 
nation must meet, if it expects to survive. In the 
ante-machinery days, Crusoe was in first hand con- 
tact with realities and real processes. 

The type of man which these conditions produced, 
as well as the conditions themselves are represented 
in Longfellow's poem, "The Village Blacksmith." 
It was a condition in which the individual was all 
important. Today the individual is lost in the mass. 
Trades unions are dealt with in the mass. The 
proprietor considers his men in the mass. The com- 
ing of the factory, the growth of towns and cities, 
which the factory fostered, and the specialization of 
industry, in which each individual has been forced 
to limit himself to one small specialty, has done 
the individual a great wrong, weakened his man- 



WHOSE BUSINESS Is THIS? 167 

hood and limited his whole outlook. u To-day one 
son of the village blacksmith is nailing machine- 
made horseshoes on with machine-made nails, and 
repairing for farmers iron-work which is wrought 
elsewhere. The other sons have gone into town and 
are factory hands. One worked in the fluff-filled 
air of a cotton mill and slept in a dark bedroom. 
He died of consumption." On the farm a man of 
necessity becomes an all-round man. In the factory 
he becomes the one bit of machinery, which has not 
yet been invented. 

It was for this reason that Rousseau with keen 
foresight, perceived the educational value of "Rob- 
inson Crusoe" for our modern industrial world. 
He said: "Since we must have books, there is one 
which, in my opinion, is a most excellent treatise on 
natural education. This is the first my Emilius shall 
read; his whole library shall long consist of this 
work only, which shall preserve an eminent rank to 
the very last. It shall be the text to which all our 
conversations on natural science are to serve only 
as a comment. It shall be our guide during our 
progress to maturity of judgment; and so long as 
our taste is not adulterated, the perusal of this book 
shall afford us pleasure. And what surprising book 
is this? Is it Aristotle? Is is Pliny? Is it Buffon? 
No; it is 'Robinson Crusoe.' The value and im- 
portance of the various arts are ordinarily esti- 
mated, not according to their real utility, but by 
the gratification which they administer to the fan- 



168 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

tastic desires of mankind. But Emilius shall be 
taught to view them in a different light; 'Robinson 
Crusoe' shall teach him to value the stock of an 
ironmonger above that of the most magnificent toy- 
shop in Europe." 

We cannot, of course, return to the natural con- 
dition of things, as Rousseau urged that we should 
do, and discard machinery, because this would be 
like throwing out the baby with the bath. But the 
effect of wage-slavery on character and the deterio- 
ration of human nature caused by slavery to machi- 
nery, leads us straight to the heart of the question 
we are discussing. We must make no mistake as 
to what the question is, if we are to discover what 
it is that we must do. The fact is very little realized 
as yet that there can be no real freedom, except 
where there is manual labor on like terms. Under 
the slavery system in the South, the white masters 
were quite as much enslaved as were the negroes, 
and when slavery was abolished the whites' as well 
as the blacks were left helpless and dependent, un- 
able to do for themselves. Servility destroys both 
the spirit of independence and democracy and it 
still survives in our social life. Maria Montessori, 
in her remarkable book on education, points out 
with great clearness the significance of this fact. 

She shows that our servants are not our depen- 
dents; rather, it is we who are dependent upon 
them; that it is not possible to accept universally, 
as a part of our social structure, such a deep human 



WHOSE BUSINESS Is THIS? 169 

error as servitude without feeling the general ef- 
fects of it in the form of moral inferiority. "We 
often believe ourselves to be independent simply 
because no one commands us, and because we com- 
mand others, but the nobleman who needs to call a 
servant to his aid is really a dependent through his 
own inferiority. The paralytic who cannot take off 
his boots because of a pathological fact and the 
prince who dare not take them off because of a social 
fact, are in reality reduced to the same condition. 
In reality, he who is served is limited in his inde- 
pendence. This concept will be the foundation of 
the dignity of the man of the future : 'I do not wish 
to be served, because I am not an impotent,' and 
this idea must be gained before men can feel them- 
selves to be really free." The far-reaching effects 
of work for one's self cannot be too much empha- 
sized. It is impotence due to a lack of experience 
in manual labor that mostly produces the domineer- 
ing spirit of the taskmaster. The tyranical spirit 
is usually due to helplessness. Independence, self- 
development, a friendly spirit, the sense of soli- 
darity, which result from manual labor are cardinal 
elements in democracy. 

The complexities of modern life obviously forbid 
any return to a more simple democratic order, and 
for this reason make the discovery of compensa- 
tions for this handicap the more obviously urgent. 
It is humanly possible and also obligatory, that we 
establish a system of education to antidote the 



170 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

blighting effects of machinery and re-organize in- 
dustry itself in such fashion as to minimize the 
possible damage from it. 

Is it not apparent that your factory is a com- 
munity concern? One further consideration makes 
it still more apparent and also tragic. Modern 
industry is so organized that it produces more goods 
than the producers are able to buy. It must, there- 
fore, seek a foreign market to dispose of this sur- 
plus product. The bitter contest for these markets 
among the nations is the chief cause of interna- 
tional misunderstanding. Economic war leads di- 
rectly to national war. It reaches its hand into 
every village and home and takes from them the 
flower of its young manhood to shed its life blood 
in a contest for the possession of things. When, 
therefore, modern industry, as it is now organized 
in Europe and America, is likely to rob my fireside 
of what is more dear to me than life itself, am I 
not vitally interested in the organization of indus- 
try? It is the common basic concern of every citizen 
in the nation, and should be the leading subject for 
discussion in the town-meeting of every city and 
village and country-side. 

Any resentment of the interest, which "We, the 
people," take in your factory, any attitude which 
would lead you to say or even think, "The public be 
damned," is insultingly out of place. It would be 
more appropriate if "We, the people" should resent 
your presence in the community. Please do not 



WHOSE BUSINESS Is THIS? 171 

misunderstand. "We, the people" are not against 
your factory; we are for it. We have earned the 
right to speak plainly to you, because we have made 
you possible. We have already underwritten you. 
Your dependence on the community may be clearly 
illustrated by so simple a thing as the use of money. 
Money is the accepted medium of exchange for 
organized business in the modern world. The old 
method of barter is impossible in towns and cities. 
When money ceases to have a recognized value, all 
business is seriously crippled and may become utterly 
paralyzed and next to impossible. This is what has 
happened in Europe, through the reckless manu- 
facture of paper money, which has little or no value. 
We are now seeing in Europe an actual exhibit of 
the paper-money scheme, described in Goethe's 
"Faust," with the same inevitable results which are 
disastrous anywhere else, except in an imaginary 
drama. H. G. Wells has recently shocked us by a 
description of conditions in Europe resulting from 
the demoralization of money. He says: 

"Europe without trustworthy money is as para- 
lyzed as a brain without wholesome blood. She 
cannot act, she cannot move. Employment becomes 
impossible and production dies away. The towns 
move steadily towards the starvation that has over- 
taken Petrograd and the peasants and cultivators 
cease to grow anything except to satisfy their own 
needs. To go to market with produce, except to 
barter, is a mockery. The schools are not working, 



172 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the hospitals, the public services; the teachers and 
doctors and officials cannot live upon their pay, 
they starve or go away. 

"We have weakened the link of cash payments, 
which has hitherto held civilization together, to the 
breaking point. As the link breaks the machine 
stops. The modern city will become a formless 
mob of unemployed men and the countryside will 
become a wilderness of food-hoarding peasants 
and since the urban masses will have no food and 
no means of commanding it, we may expect the 
most violent pertubations, before they are persuaded 
to accept their fate in a philosophical spirit. Revo- 
lutionary social outbreaks are not the results of 
plots; they are symptoms of social disease. They 
are not causes but effects. This is what I mean when 
I write of a breakdown of civilization." 

Now, validity can be given to money only by 
the community, that is, the nation. Without such 
validity the conduct of your business is impossible. 
The dependence of modern industry on the com- 
munity in the matter of money is likewise true in 
other respects just as essential to its prosperity. 
The community, therefore, has earned the right not 
only to request, but to demand that industry hold 
itself responsible for the community's most vital 
concern, namely, the welfare of its citizens. 

I said a few moments ago, that the big event of 
modern times is the fact that workmen have become 
citizens, acquired equality before the law. This 



WHOSE BUSINESS Is THIS? 173 

is the cause of industrial unrest. It is not a question 
of wages, or working conditions or the recognition 
of the union. These are all secondary questions and 
symptoms of an underlying cause. The real cause 
is far more fundamental. It is the workman's de- 
mand for a new status. In politics he has acquired 
a new status. He has ceased to act on the basis of 
faith and obedience, and occupies the position where 
he is informed and consulted. He demands the 
same in industry. Progress in industry is one hun- 
dred fifty years behind progress in politics. He 
demands that it be brought up to date. There is 
now an irreconcilable conflict between his status in 
economics and his status in politics. 

There are two laws discrete 

Not reconciled 

Law for man and law for thing; 

The last builds town and fleet, 

But it runs wild, 

And doth the man unking. 

It is quite unthinkable that the man, who has been 
crowned king over himself in politics, will submit 
to the process of being unkinged in industry. It 
is an irrepressible issue. The only possible way to 
meet this issue is to give him the new status in indus- 
try and to assist him to make himself worthy of it. 









CHAPTER VI 

CREATING A DISPUTE 

\T7HEN I say that the industrial problem is a 
community concern, I use words accurately. 
I do not refer to government, federal, state or local. 
I refer to the community, that is, the nation. 
Nothing is more important at this point than to make 
a clear distinction between the government and the 
nation. Government, however important it is, is 
only a piece of administrative machinery; the nation 
is the people. Government is simply the instrument 
of the will of society. An organized community of 
citizens expressing its will effectively for the com- 
mon welfare is the nation itself. A nation is the 
will to be one people and exists nowhere except in 
the hearts of the people. It is the American theory 
that the people should not follow their government, 
but that their government should follow them. In 
the United States the people do not take their hats 
off to their president; he takes his hat off to them. 
This fact is impressive and significant. 

In order to make this distinction unmistakably 
clear, I quote two incisive statements by two writers 
with world reputations. I purposely omit their 
names, in order that our attention may be centered 

174 



CREATING A DISPUTE 175 

on the merit of the statements themselves, unbiased 
by connecting them with their authors. 

The author of the first passage did almost as 
much as any other single man to achieve American 
independence. His statement is as follows: 

"Some writers have so confounded society with 
government, as to leave little or no distinction be- 
tween them; whereas they are not only different, but 
have different origins. Society is produced by our 
wants, and government by our wickedness; the for- 
mer promotes our happiness positively by uniting 
our affections, the latter negatively by restraining 
our vices. The one encourages intercourse, the 
other creates distinctions. The first is a patron, the 
last a punisher. 

"Society in every state is a blessing, but govern- 
ment, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; 
in its worst state an intolerable one ; for when we 
suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by the 
government, which we might expect in a country 
without government, our calamity is heightened by 
reflecting that we furnish the means by which we 
suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost 



innocence." 



The author of the second passage was one of 
the best-loved men both in America and Europe. 
His statement is as follows : 

"You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's 
country, not to its institutions or its office-holders. 
The country is the real thing, the eternal thing; it 



176 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

is the thing to watch over, and care for, and be 
loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its 
mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become 
ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect 
the body from winter, disease and death. To be 
loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to 
die for rags that is a loyalty of unreason, it is 
pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented 
by monarchy; let monarchy keep it. I was from 
Connecticut, whose constitution declares 'that all 
political power is inherent in the people, and all free 
governments are founded on their authority and 
instituted for their benefit; and that they have at 
all times an undeniable and indefeasible right to 
alter their form of government in such a manner 
as they may think expedient.' 

"Under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he 
sees the commonwealth's political clothes are worn 
out, and yet holds his peace and does not agitate 
for a new suit, is disloyal; he is a traitor. That 
he may be the only one who thinks he sees this 
decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate 
anyway, and it is the duty of the others to vote him 
down, if they do not see the matter as he does." 

I dwell on this distinction between the state and 
the nation, because there is now in some quarters a 
revival of the ancient and futile idea, that the indus- 
trial problem can be solved by governmental action. 
Now, I am not one of those, who believes that 
"government touches nothing that it does not de- 



CREATING A DISPUTE 177 

form," or that the function of the state should be 
limited to that of a night watchman for the protec- 
tion of property. I believe that government is a 
useful and necessary piece of machinery and should 
be utilized as far as it is available for use. But we 
must be guided by the fact in the case. The obvious 
fact about government is that it can operate only 
on the basis of the lowest common denominator 
which is usually quite low. It can do only what 
public opinion will support. While we should strive 
to raise this common denominator to make govern- 
ment more useful, yet we cannot expect it to go far 
in the direction of creative activity. 

Essentially government is a police power for pur- 
poses of protection and not for the promotion of 
vital movements. The less police power the better. 
The stronger the police power, the weaker the na- 
tion. When the Russian nation under the czar was 
weakest in justice and honor, it had the strongest 
police power. When the nation is wholesome and 
strong in its integrity, it has less and less need for 
police power. For any positive achievement we 
must go behind governments and deal with those 
forces that control governments and create law. A 
law never creates anything. It only regulates what 
is already created. It does not stimulate men to do 
right; it but deters them from doing wrong and 
even that it does very imperfectly. 

The inherent nature of government, therefore, 
disqualifies it for effective use in dealing with a 



178 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

creative activity, such as is involved in the industrial 
problem. The method it uses is force. In a human 
problem like this, any form of force is utterly futile. 
Writs of injunction, prison sentences, federal troops, 
are not a solution, but an aggravation. Industrial 
courts as a means of solving the problem are not 
an aid, but a hindrance to progress. Such courts 
were tried as long ago as four hundred years, with 
worse than negative results. In New Zealand 
twenty years ago they were tried and failed and 
have now been abandoned. For the past two years 
one has been tried in the state of Kansas and there 
have occurred more strikes than during any similar 
period in the history of the state. In the Pittsburgh 
district there occurred 228 strikes during the first 
six months of 1921, an average of 38 strikes a 
month. But during the 33 months from April, 
1916, to January 31, 1918, there occurred 364 
strikes, an average of 11 strikes a month. This is 
to say that after the industrial court was set up there 
were over three times as many strikes as before. 

This negative result is only what might naturally 
have been expected. An industrial court can deal 
only with a contest over a detail of the problem. It 
does not deal with causes, but only with effects. 
Now, the only possible way to get rid of any trouble 
is to remove the cause that produced it. Recently 
an official of the Pennsylvania Railroad presented 
an issue to the Federal Labor board for its con- 
sideration. He was told that the board could not 



CREATING A DISPUTE 179 

legally consider it, because the railroad had not 
created a dispute on the issue with its workmen. 
Thereupon the railroad proceeded deliberately to 
create a dispute with its men, so that the issue could 
be considered by the labor board. 

This fact exhibits the weakness and futility of an 
industrial court in dealing with industrial problems. 
It explains not only why it produces negative results, 
but also why it does positive damage to the cause it 
aims to serve. A court is a scene of conflict between 
contestants engaged in a civil war. The court by 
its method is a continuation of the very thing we 
want to prevent. It stimulates the very thing we 
are trying to curb. It carries on the conflict, con- 
test, trial of battle; we aim to remove the cause of 
conflict as the only possible means of stopping it. 
You can't stop one conflict by starting another. The 
way to fight fire is not with fire, but with water. 
"The closed hand gets the shut fist," is an old Irish 
proverb and like most proverbs expresses a universal 
human experience. 

The method of compulsory arbitration through 
a court has thus far been a demonstrated failure. 
The failure of the Kansas Industrial court is due to 
two basic facts. First on the part of workers, they 
will not consent to work under a threat of imprison- 
ment at a rate of wages fixed by a court. They 
regard labor under these conditions as peonage, and 
rightly so. Between freeman's citizenship and in- 
dustrial slavery there is an irreconcilable conflict. 



180 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

Second, from the standpoint of the court there is 
no recognized principle of justice wjiich such a 
court can apply. There is no such principle because 
in modern industry wages are determined by a com- 
plex combination of factors involving managers, 
workmen and consumers, and therefore can be 
regulated only by voluntary and continuous adjust- 
ment. 

For this reason Chief Justice Taft, in a recently 
delivered opinion, refers to the Kansas court as 
"a board miscalled a court." It is in fact not a 
court but a commission. To call it a court only 
disguised a fact which ought to have been kept 
clear and distinct. "I do not want to be critical 
of a state or of the effort of its legislature to solve 
troublesome problems of unrest," said Ex-Senator 
Kenyon, "but personally it seems to me the Kansas 
Industrial court cannot be a success because it has 
no underlying code of rules or principles which 
are regulatory or mandatory upon the court. A 
labor organization, person, or corporation coming 
under its jurisdiction has no bill of rights which can 
be invoked before the court. The matter depends 
entirely upon the judge. Further, it seems to me 
the court is based upon a violation of previous 
experience, both here and abroad, arising from leg- 
islation prohibiting strikes, and further, it aims to 
solve a problem in human adjustments with an 
arbitrary, rigid and unrestricted judicial fiat." 

Everywhere "federated capital" is engaged in a 



CREATING A DISPUTE 181 

civil war with "federated labor," to the serious in- 
jury of both and also of the community. By re- 
jecting the court as an instrument, I do not mean 
that the community shall do nothing about this civil 
war; I mean there is a more excellent way than the 
method of the industrial court and the use of force. 
The court uses the method of the arena; the more 
excellent way is the policy of co-operation. Ob- 
viously co-operation is effective only when it is free. 
We are all agreed that free co-operation is what we 
aim to produce as the essential condition for suc- 
cess in the conduct of industry. Logic and experi- 
ence have sufficiently demonstrated the fact beyond 
the need of further argument that free co-operation 
never can be secured by the use of any kind of 
force. In an equation involving human nature, 
freedom and force cancel each other. The differ- 
ence in method and result between these two pol- 
icies is obvious and radical. The method of the 
arena is a demonstrated failure. The policy of 
free co-operation alone holds promise of industrial 
peace. 

By the more excellent way, I mean an informed 
and organized public opinion and nothing else. 
There are only two ways to govern a community; 
one is by force, the other by public opinion. Of 
these two, public opinion is not only the right 
method, but also the more effective. It alone can 
create a mental revolution and that is the one thing 
needed to transform modern industry. But it will 



182 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

be a "reasonable" revolution, whose achievement 
is peace. It is stronger than courts, or armies, or 
prisons, or governments; indeed it is the maker of 
them all. It and it alone can create a new and 
better industrial order. 

How can it be operated? Instead of establish- 
ing industrial courts, there should be set up in 
every city and village and country side an instrument 
or new machine, whose accurate and descriptive 
title would be "the public committee on intelligence 
and good-will" For short it may probably be called 
"the public committee." It is so called in one city. 
In another city it is called "the community confer- 
ence board." A natural short title would be "the 
community labor board," or "the community in- 
dustrial board." But each of these names is so 
handicapped by association as to make its use un- 
wise. The community labor board would suggest 
to some that it was composed of employees alone, 
although the word "labor" ought to be dignified 
in meaning and broadened in scope to apply to all 
of us. The community industrial board would sug- 
gest to some that it was composed of employers 
alone, although the word "industrial" ought to in- 
clude all engaged in industry. It is necessary to 
use an unspoiled word in this connection, into which 
we can put a fresh content suggestive of the new 
function the board is designed to perform. We, 
therefore, suggest and recommend as the best name, 
"the community engineering board." The word 



CREATING A DISPUTE 183 

"engineering" identifies the board with no class and 
suggests the essential nature of its task. Its busi- 
ness is not to conduct any operation or propaganda, 
but to plan, suggest and engineer the process of 
community building. 

The longer title above suggested is used to de- 
scribe its purpose and function. Every word in it 
is significant. The word "public" means that the 
committee represents the public alone, not any or- 
ganization, or class of citizens. It is not made up 
of representatives of "capital" and "labor" and 
the "public." That is a soviet form of organiza- 
tion and hurtful in operation. Moreover it is false 
to the facts. The public is not "the party of the 
third part," it is "the committee of the whole," 
which includes capitalists and workmen also. For 
them to regard themselves as set off apart from the 
public as its enemies or exploiters, is chiefly what 
makes the labor problem. The word "public" 
means that the committee is unofficial, but repre- 
sentative. Only three members on it should be 
appointed because of the positions they occupy; one 
is the mayor; one is the superintendent of public 
instruction and one is the judge of a court. These 
three officers are the servants of all the people, and 
they represent the three outstanding pieces of public 
machinery nearest to the people, the town govern- 
ment, the public school and the courts. All other 
members of the committee should be representatives 
of all classes and shades of opinion, but selected as 



184 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

individuals, not officially by any club, labor union, 
chamber of commerce or by any special govern- 
mental agency, court or council. 

The significance of the word "public" in the con- 
struction of this committee is the essential fact to 
keep clearly in the foreground, because it is the 
distinguishing feature of a new method of proce- 
dure. Hitherto all commissions appointed to handle 
industrial disputes have been composed of three 
groups, "capital," "labor," and "the public." This 
is why their success glares by its absence. How 
could you expect successful results from a committee 
composed of three groups, two of which are organ- 
ized and at war with each other? Our ground of 
hope that a committee, organized on the new plan 
here suggested, will succeed, is the obvious fact 
that there is no reason why two contending groups 
should submit to each other, but every reason to 
expect that they will be willing to submit to a prin- 
ciple superior to them both. This superior principle 
is the public welfare in which each of the contend- 
ing factions also has a share. 

Because an engineering board does not take sides 
with either faction, we are not to conclude that its 
aim is to be neutral, that it inflicts on itself the 
weakness of a negative attitude on questions involv- 
ing justice. It emphatically takes sides, not with 
any group, but with the public interest. In its 
behalf it fights without truce. It wages unrelenting 
war against enemies of the common good. It is 



CREATING A DISPUTE 185 

not for any party, but it is for a principle. It is 
because its policy is dictated by principle, that it is 
in no sense partisan. 

The word "intelligence" suggests the first essen- 
tial function of such a community engineering 
board. Its a fact-finding agency. It is to equip 
itself with information about modern industry, its 
history, its methods, its organization, capital, wages, 
working conditions, treatment of workmen, sug- 
gested improvements, its relation to national wel- 
fare. The systematic effort to secure knowledge of 
these facts and to make it available for public use 
is a needed public service of highest value and in- 
dispensable to the safety of any community. Every 
citizen is under moral obligation not to be ignorant 
of facts as vital as these are. To ascertain the 
facts and submit them impartially to employers, 
employees and the public, would go far to solve 
the labor troubles before they happen, because they 
are due to a misunderstanding more than to any 
other single cause. "Ye shall know the truth and 
the truth shall make you free," said the greatest 
of all democrats, because He realized that the only 
road to freedom is knowledge of fact. The at- 
tempt of such a board to make itself intelligent on 
this subject would be a shocking revelation of the 
amount of ignorance now existing with reference to 
it. Even a short experience on the board would 
lead an average citizen to agree with Mark Twain 
when he said: "The older I grow the more I am 



186 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

astounded to discover how much ignorance one can 
contain without bursting one's clothes." 

The other word "good-will," suggests the other 
chief function of a community engineering board. 
The first function is to ascertain facts; this is its 
major work. The second function is to create good- 
will; this is its method of conducting the work and 
utilizing the facts. The importance of promoting 
free trade in friendship cannot be over-stated. To 
carry on its work without this spirit is like drawing 
a harrow over frozen ground. The reason for its 
importance is the fact that men are more influenced 
through their feelings than through their intellects. 
This is why poets have been called "the unacknowl- 
edged legislators of the world." They think with 
their hearts. So do all men. Unless the method 
of the poet is used, neither wars, industries nor any 
other enterprises requiring concerted action, can be, 
or in fact ever are, carried on successfully. 

When it was proposed in the British Parliament 
during the Revolutionary War, to send to the col- 
onies new supplies of guns and ammunition, William 
Pitt arose and said: "We must reckon not so much 
on the amount and quality of our guns as on the 
sentiment for liberty in the hearts of the American 
Soldiers." Likewise with the industrial war. It 
is not a question of mechanics, but of morals. It 
will be determined by the sentiment in the hearts of 
those involved in the contest. 

The use of this method of a community engineer- 



CREATING A DISPUTE 187 

ing board is so essential to its successful operation, 
that 1 emphasize it by quoting a clear and forceful 
statement of its importance by Abraham Lincoln, 
who was expert in his knowledge of human nature. 
He said: 

"If you would win a man to your cause, first 
convince him that you are his true friend. Therein 
is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say 
what he will, is the greatest highroad to his reason, 
and which when once gained, you will find but little 
trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of 
your cause, if, indeed that cause be really a just one. 
On the contrary, assume to dictate to his judgment, 
or to command his action, or to mark him as one 
to be shunned or despised, and he will retreat within 
himself, close all the avenues to his head and heart; 
and though your cause be naked truth itself, trans- 
formed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel and 
sharper than steel can be made, and though you 
throw it with more than herculean force and pre- 
cision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than 
to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye 
straw. Such is man and so must he be understood 
by those who would lead him, even to his own 
interests." 

A community engineering board should be a 
standing committee, permanently at work. Its duty 
would be to settle strikes as occasion required or to 
arbitrate difficulties, when requested to do so. But 
such a task is only incidental to its main work. Its 



188 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

real work is far more fundamental in character. 
Arbitration implies a conflict, and a strike is an 
actual civil war. The board's job is to remove the 
cause of conflict, so that there will be no need to 
arbitrate; to do the work not of cure but of pre- 
vention; to stimulate and assist in the reorganization 
of industry on a new basis, which will eliminate the 
losses due to constant conflict. 

This larger conception of its task at once makes 
clear the necessity for the board to consider such 
questions as these : The tragedy and suffering due 
to the uncertainty of employment; the release of 
credit facilities to make possible the inauguration 
of useful industrial enterprises; the establishment of 
certain types of work for public improvement in 
order to utilize the productive energies of men now 
lost to the community during periods of unemploy- 
ment. 

The board's investigation work and advisory ser- 
vice will require years of quiet and patient labor, 
but it will be fascinating labor. While this un- 
finished task is being carried on, and as a continuous 
stimulation to it, there are two activities which it 
can immediately undertake to put into operation its 
two guiding principles: organized intelligence and 
organized good-will. The aim of these two activ- 
ities is to establish points of contact between mem- 
bers of the employing class and the working class. 
Points of social contact and points of mental con- 
tact. 



CREATING A DISPUTE 189 

First, good-will. To promote this it is suggested 
that the community engineering board arrange oc- 
casionally a social evening. The most effective plan 
for our purpose would be an inexpensive banquet, 
where people of all classes sat around the same 
table for their evening meal, broke bread together, 
"tasted each other's salt," which, according to the 
Eastern custom, cements their friendship. It is a 
real communion supper, a community dinner party. 
At it there should always be good music, which is 
the common denominator of community activity; 
the universal language. An invitation issued by the 
public committee, on which are men and women of 
all classes, would receive a favorable response from 
employers, employees and the public. It is the only 
invitation which would receive such a response. 

The function of this dinner party is to promote 
free trade in friendship. It is obviously far more 
than a pleasant social event. It strikes at the root of 
some of the chief causes of industrial trouble. For 
as George Frederic Watts said: "The hunger for 
brotherhood is at the bottom of the unrest of the 
civilized world." The constructive value of friend- 
ship for social and industrial politics ought to be 
obvious, but it is constantly side-tracked by the 
complex and futile methods of legal and military 
procedure. Centuries ago it was obvious to Aris- 
totle, who said : "When men are friends there is no 
need of justice, but when they are just, they still 
need friendship." 



190 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

Second, intelligence. To promote this it is sug- 
gested that the community engineering board ar- 
range for a public consideration of all phases of 
the industrial problem by means of addresses, de- 
bates and general discussion. The best time and 
place for it is immediately after the dinner party 
as an after-dinner program. The friendly spirit 
of the dinner creates a helpful atmosphere in which 
to consider questions over which there is, or may 
be, a sharp difference of opinion. It ought to be 
clearly understood that there is no intention of 
using this occasion for inducing men to surrender 
their convictions, or of "putting something over" 
on anybody. Otherwise the project will be still- 
born. No debatable or unsettled element of the 
labor problem, should be presented without pre- 
senting both sides of it. Sometimes an arranged 
debate would not only be an agreeable departure 
from a series of addresses, but also far more effec- 
tive and illuminating. The aim is to secure a better 
understanding among men, who are now antagon- 
ists. This strikes at another basic cause of indus- 
trial conflict. Dallas Lore Sharp was not far from 
the truth when he said: "It is not work that divides 
masses from classes and sets worker against em- 
ployer, nor is it money; it is lack of understanding." 
How is it possible to eliminate lack of understand- 
ing, unless men are granted the right to express 
their convictions without reservation, and unless 
also they perform the duty of listening with respect 



CREATING A DISPUTE 191 

to opinions differing from their own? The spirit, 
dominating the public meetings of the community 
engineering board, should be the spirit which in- 
spired Voltaire to say: "I wholly disagree with 
what you say and will contend to the death for 
your right to say it." The time for these frank 
discussions is before a strike begins, not after the 
feelings have been charged with anger and the mind 
beclouded with prejudice. The community engi- 
neering board is a piece of social machinery through 
which the pooled intelligence of a community may 
be made available in the effort to solve its industrial 
problem. 

These then are the chief activities of the com- 
munity engineering board. In order to assist in 
the reconstruction of modern industry and remove 
the causes of industrial civil war, its function is 
to conduct a continuous impartial investigation, an 
occasional community dinner party and a public 
discussion of the industrial problem. I have pur- 
posely omitted any description of details of pro- 
cedure, because the organization of the board and 
its methods of work will necessarily vary greatly 
according to the nature and size of the locality. 
The American people have ingenuity and are ac- 
customed to use their own initiative. They will 
have no difficulty in adapting this new community 
machine to their own needs. 

Its purpose and work, as here stated, clearly in- 
dicate that it is designed to meet an unmet and 



192 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

urgent need and to render a service of incalculable 
value to the common welfare. To stimulate an 
open mind and friendly spirit is constructive work 
of indispensable importance, if we are to hope for 
any industrial peace. With an open mind and 
friendly spirit anything can be accomplished; with- 
out them, nothing can. In the old days of the 
home industries, master and men were by their 
work kept in daily human contact on the basis of 
social equality. Industry has grown more and more 
mechanical; less and less human. It is handicapped 
by bigness. The lack of human touch must be sup- 
plied by conscious effort. Social and mental contact 
can now be secured by a plan like the community 
dinner party here suggested. The new method, 
while handicapped by size, has some advantages 
over the old one. In the old days men met chiefly 
as master and workman. On the new plan they 
will meet not as employer and employee, but as 
fellow citizens on the basis of equality before the 
law, equality of manhood. 

The bigness of modern industrial operations re- 
quires new methods, but removes neither the need 
nor the possibility of securing intelligent sympathy. 
Inasmuch as man is a time-binder, thinks in terms 
of time, lives in ideas, he easily can leap over the 
barriers of space, and size, and numbers. It is 
as possible for five hundred men to be animated 
by the same idea in a common enterprise as for 
fifty. Mental contact is not conditioned on space 



CREATING A DISPUTE 193 

and size. It is primarily a spiritual, not a physical, 
process. 

Up to this point we have considered the func- 
tion of community engineering boards only as they 
are related to the industrial problem. But they 
will not go far in the process of handling this 
problem before they discover that very little real 
progress is possible unless they handle the com- 
munity problem as well. The two problems are so 
organically related that neither can be handled ef- 
fectively by itself alone. If you start with com- 
munity life you are sure to run into industry; if 
you start with industry you are sure to run into 
community life. They are no longer two worlds, 
but one and the same world. 

We began with the industrial half of the problem, 
because industry is the dominant social, political 
and spiritual problem of today. During the past 
thirty years we have become an industrialized so- 
ciety. This radically alters the equation. Whether 
for better or worse we need not say, but it's differ- 
ent. Henceforth the community movement has no 
choice; it must deal with industry. 

It is not only a community concern, but our chief 
concern. For an industrial community to consider 
community problems apart from industry is like 
playing "Hamlet" without Hamlet. Not only an 
industry's contacts with the community and the 
human factors inside the industry are community 






194 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

problems, but the industry itself is a community 
problem. 

If industry has affected the community pro- 
foundly, the community will likewise affect industry. 
Indeed, the community principle holds the key, we 
believe, to the solution of industry's problem, in so 
far as there is any solution. We feel under obli- 
gation to render this service to industry. 

The function, therefore, of community engineer- 
ing boards is to handle both the industrial and 
the community problems and to do both at the same 
time, because they are two halves of one whole, 
like the two sides of the same shield. The com- 
munity problem offers these boards a fascinating 
opportunity to render a constructive service to the 
nation at the point of its greatest need. 

As pathfinders, the New England Pilgrims con- 
tributed two institutions to America the public 
school and the town meeting. 

The first comers from Europe were people of 
considerable education. They early established a 
public school system in Massachusetts. For a time 
all went well. But by the end of the first third 
of the nineteenth century public education had fallen 
into decay. The democratic ideals of its founders 
had vanished and what there was of it was of a low 
order. 

Then came Horace Mann, the first man who 
really understood the educational needs of the na- 
tion. He started a revival in public education, 



CREATING A DISPUTE 195 

restored it to a democratic basis, modified it to 
meet new conditions, and had the practical capacity 
to make his reforms effective. If the public school 
is now our biggest national asset and achievement, 
it is due to Horace Mann, who is justly called the 
father of American education. 

The town meeting likewise fell into decay. Al- 
though one of the oldest traditions of the English 
race and the basis of our whole system, it has long 
been crumbling and has not been restored. What 
Horace Mann did for the public school is what now 
needs to be done for the town meeting idea. This 
is the big item in the nation's unfinished business, 
for an intelligent and organized public opinion is the 
one effective guarantee of progress in any line of 
social endeavor. 

A community engineering board, in directing the 
construction of local self-governing organizations 
of citizens, aims to carry on the purpose for which 
the United States was organized and to create the 
means by which society may express its will effec- 
tively for the common welfare. 

Its program of action consists in the application 
of one clear, simple, basic principle to various needs, 
which are so organically related that they must be 
considered together. 

Its method of procedure is free and untrammeled 
discussion. If this method fails us, what hope is 
there for democracy? "If water chokes, what can 
one drink to stop choking?" 



196 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

Its chief tasks are: To organize community 
centers on the basis of citizenship; to keep them 
organized by helping to discover and devise prac- 
tical projects; to furnish youth, resident aliens, and 
newly-enfranchised women the opportunity to equip 
themselves for the duties and rights of citizenship; 
to establish adult schools for working people; to 
co-ordinate social agencies and eliminate waste of 
duplication; to relate the services of municipal and. 
volunteer agencies effectively to the people for 
whom they are designed; to settle strikes whenever 
this service is required, but still better, to remove 
the causes of the industrial civil war; to apply the 
community principle in any other ways which may 
promote concerted action for the common welfare. 

This task is big, of course. That's why it's fas- 
cinating; it is both a science and an art. Engi- 
neering boards must discover a body of agreed 
community principles, the laws of social life. They 
must acquire facts. They are fact-finding commit- 
tees, but they are very much more than this. The 
art of their task is their chief concern. 

They must devise ways of making their facts 
useful and the art of putting their principles into 
practice. Art is the process of translating an ideal 
into fact. If you succeed, then you have romance, 
for romance is a dream come true. It is not mere 
knowledge we seek, but intelligence; not learning, 
but wisdom. This is why average men and women 
are fitted to serve on these boards. 



CREATING A DISPUTE 197 

Experts and specialists are not needed. Indeed 
the trouble they have caused is what we seek to 
correct. Everybody's a specialist. u The miller 
thinks that the wheat grows only in order to keep 
his mill going.' 1 So all men and agencies are pris- 
oners to their special work and point of view. Our 
aim is to be "generalists," to study the community 
as a whole and to co-ordinate its activities for the 
common good. 

The function of engineering boards is to pioneer 
in the attempt to usher in the age of good sense in 
the conduct of community affairs, including industry. 
They can transform a community's problem into an 
opportunity. The problem they are designed to 
meet is not only urgent, but the most urgent of our 
public needs. "The public," said Hegel, "is that 
part of the state which does not know what it 
wants." To assist it to discover what it ought to 
want and how to give its desires effective expres- 
sion for the common good, that is America's big 
job in every local community. 

Lincoln exhibited the wisdom of a far-sighted 
statesman, and the fine balance between a clear 
brain and tender heart best of all in his policy to 
make the salvation of the Union his dominant aim, 
more important than the destruction of any partic- 
ular evil. The salvation of the Union, he believed, 
made possible the continuous conquest of many par- 
ticular evils. 

If we are guided by Lincoln's judgment, would 



198 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

we not conclude that likewise in every local com- 
munity the task of first importance is to restore 
and preserve the union of citizens in an understand- 
ing of their common concerns and in concerted ac- 
tion on their behalf? To achieve this purpose, for 
which as yet no effective instrument anywhere ex- 
ists, the community engineering board is designed. 
It is a bridge-builder, to reconstruct the broken- 
down bridges of communication and understanding 
among conflicting groups of citizens, organized to 
contend for their own interests. For success in a 
task as difficult as this one obviously is, it is essen- 
tial first to create community morale. For this 
reason we have stressed the creative power of good- 
will as an integrating influence. In social engi- 
neering it is a factor of first importance. "Morale," 
said Napoleon, "is to force as three is to one." 

If I were asked to select one word to describe 
the great purpose and work of the community engi- 
neering board, I would select the word chosen by 
David Grayson to describe himself. When he sat 
at dinner with a factory owner, Mr. Vedder, and 
was helping him to settle a strike then in operation, 
Mr. Vedder asked him what kind of social phil- 
osopher he called himself. "I do not call myself 
by any name," said Grayson, "but if I chose a name, 
do you know the name I would like to have applied 
to me?" "I cannot imagine," was the answer. 
"Well, I would like to be called 'an introducer. 1 
My friend, Mr. Blacksmith, let me introduce you 



CREATING A DISPUTE 199 

to my friend, Mr. Plutocrat. I could almost swear 
that you are brothers, so near alike you are. You 
will find each other wonderfully interesting, once 
you get over the awkwardness of the introduction." 
"It is a good name," said Mr. Vedder, laughing. 
"It's a wonderful name," said Grayson, "and it's 
about the biggest and finest work in the world to 
know human beings just as they are and to make 
them acquainted with one another just as they are. 
Why, it's the foundation of all the democracy there 
is or ever will be. Sometimes I think that friend- 
liness is the only achievement of life worth while, 
and unfriendliness the only tragedy." 

If a community engineering board is effectively 
to do constructive work of permanent value, there is 
one principle it must undeviatingly practice. It must 
be impartial. It is not the friend of the rich man; 
nor the friend of the poor man; just the friend of 
man. Because it takes the side only of the im- 
partial public, its clearly understood purpose must 
be: 

To ease the strong of their burden, 
To help the weak in their need. 

The board must not only be impartial, but it must 
secure the recognition of its impartiality. This may 
not be easy. It will take time and patience. There 
is so much suspicion and misunderstanding on the 
part of both owners and workmen, that it is difficult 
for either of them to believe, that any body of men 



200 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

can be impartial. They will have to be convinced 
through a process of education. 

Inasmuch as the board relies for the enforcement 
of its recommendations not on any form of phys- 
ical or legal force, but only on persuasion, educa- 
tion and the use of public opinion, therefore, its 
only capital in stock is its integrity, its moral in- 
fluence. The weight of its influence will be deter- 
mined by the knowledge of its impartiality. In the 
process of convincing owners and workmen and the 
public to believe that it is impartial, it is recom- 
mended that the board, as soon as it is formed, 
issue a declaration of principles, by which it means 
to be guided in its work. Its influence for good 
will increase as the discovery is made, that it is 
sincere in its attempt to practice them. 

As a suggestion I here reproduce, with a few 
verbal changes, a declaration of principles, which I 
prepared for a community engineering board in an 
eastern city and which it adopted. Such boards 
should prepare their own declarations, but they may 
feel free to make any use they please of the one 
here suggested, in whole or in part. It is as follows : 

THE COMMUNITY ENGINEERING 
BOARD 

Declaration of Principles 

This board is unofficial, but representative; pub- 
lic, but free. It is the voice of the impartial com- 
munity. Jn public opinion alone is the sanction of 



CREATING A DISPUTE 201 

its authority and the enforcement of its decisions. 
Its purpose is to stimulate the untrammelled practice 
of citizenship; to help in creating a New Industrial 
America ; to ascertain the facts about modern indus- 
try; to assist in the reorganization of industry on 
the basis of the manhood principle; to make clear 
the idea that labor is not a commodity; to advocate 
the practice of the community principle as the only 
solution of the industrial problem. The Board's 
work is wholly constructive; it doesn't knock, it 
builds. The program it seeks to make effective is: 

1. To terminte the civil war between capitalists 

and laborers, making them joint allies in a 
common task. 

2. To promote the spirit of good-will as a com- 
munity asset, by removing the cause of ill- 
will. ' 

3. To put the manufacture of men above the 
manufacture of things, making men and let- 
ting the men make the things. 

4. To make the community interest dominant 

over the interest of any private group. 

5. To replace production for profit by produc- 

tion for use, and thus stimulate production. 

6. To make work cease to be drudgery and 

become a means of self-expression. 



202 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

7. To apply democracy to industry, giving all 

workers a guiding part in their work. 

8. To apply justice to profits, rewarding work 

on its merits no more, no less. 

9. To apply art to industry, restoring to labor 

the sense of joy and dignity. 

10. To provide more leisure for personal growth, 
relieving the monotony of machine work and 
the blight of unemployment. 

11. To transform "hands" into "men," so that 

the workers may be whole men when they 
work, and may not cease to be citizens. 

12. To make it clear that a community's social 

welfare, its property values, its type of citi- 
zens, and its industrial conditions are or- 
ganically interdependent. 

13. To stimulate owners and workmen, to be- 

lieve that they have like interests, to recog- 
nize them as common interests, and to con- 
clude that industrial conflicts are, therefore, 
civil wars. 

14. To persuade contending parties in civil indus- 

trial wars to give first place not to their 
rights but their duties, and to treat disputes 
in the light of their obligation to public wel- 
fare, dispensing with force and substituting 
intelligence and good-will. 



CREATING A DISPUTE 203 

The foregoing declaration aims to state basic and 
recognized ethical ideals, to make clear the purpose 
of community engineering boards. As they proceed 
to the application of these standards they will, of 
course, find it necessary to formulate codes of prin- 
ciples more in particular. Such particular principles 
should be slowly and progressively developed to 
meet special needs as they arise. They should not 
be imposed from the top by legislation, but grow 
out of conditions they are designed to meet. Judge 
Kenyon, before he left the Senate, clearly indicated 
the effective process to follow, when he said, 
"Courts of compulsory arbitration have never been 
a success. Nations that have tried it are generally 
willing to acknowledge that the system is a failure. 
But that does not argue against boards of media- 
tion or industrial courts based upon an industrial 
code to investigate and propose adjustments and 
make findings, leaving to the great public the power 
to enforce them by public opinion and that is in 
any event the most powerful agency for law en- 
forcement." 

This statement describes a community engineer- 
ing board as here recommended. Public opinion, 
on which alone such a board relies, is not only the 
best agency to enforce law, but it is also the agency 
which creates the law. The common law is the 
product of the expectation of the community. It 
grew out of decisions made by a judge in response 
to what the people expected him to make in accord- 



204 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

ance with what they regarded as just. What we 
now need is a new body of common law to meet the 
new industrial conditions. The community engi- 
neering board, as here described, is the appropriate 
instrument through which (the new common law 
principles can be evolved, secure recognition, and 
be put into operation. 

This process has already received a big impetus 
through the action taken during the war to meet an 
emergency. In order to secure continuity and accel- 
eration in the production of war supplies, the gov- 
ernment found it necessary to adopt an agreed and 
uniform policy in dealing with industrial conditions. 
Accordingly early in 1918 there was convened a 
labor conference composed of representatives of 
organized employers. After several weeks of con- 
ference a series of principles was agreed on and 
President Wilson was requested to proclaim this 
code as mandatory upon all labor adjustment and 
procurement agencies of the government and also 
to establish a national war labor board to interpret 
and apply these principles. This the president did 
in April, 1918. The labor board had two joint 
chairmen representing the public, Ex-President Taft 
and the Honorable Frank P. Walsh. They ren- 
dered intelligent and conspicuous public service, 
made possible largely because of the voluntary co- 
operation of all classes of citizens in behalf of a 
cause bigger than their personal interest. 

Never before in any country had a code of funda- 



CREATING A DISPUTE 205 

mental principles on industrial relations been agreed 
upon nor a public labor board established to inter- 
pret and apply them. This fact establishes a pre- 
cedent, highly significant and inspiring. What was 
done for the destructive purposes of war, can we 
not do for the constructive purposes of peace? 
Shall we confess our inability to rise to the spiritual 
heights of patriotic devotion except in time of war? 
Is it not the function of patriotism to "wage peace" 
as well as to "wage war?" 

The series of principles adopted for the guidance 
of the war labor board is here reproduced as a 
suggestion for community engineering boards every- 
where. It is as follows: 

Working Principles 

The right of workers to organize in trade unions and to 
bargain collectively through chosen representatives is recog- 
nized and affirmed. This right shall not be denied, abridged 
or interfered with by the employers in any manner what- 
soever. 

The right of employers to organize in associations or 
groups and to bargain collectively through chosen repre- 
sentatives is recognized and affirmed. This right shall not 
be denied, abridged or interfered with by the workers in any 
manner whatsoever. 

Employers should not discharge workers for membership 
in trade unions, nor for legitimate trade union activities. 

The workers in the exercise of their right to organize 
should not use coercive measures of any kind to induce per- 
sons to join their organizations nor to induce employers to 
bargain or deal therewith. 



206 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

In establishments where the union shop exists the same 
shall continue, and the union standards as to wages, hours 
of labor and other conditions of employment shall be main- 
tained. 

In establishments where union and non-union men and 
women now work together and the employer meets only 
with employees or representatives engaged in said establish- 
ments, the continuance of such conditions shall not be 
deemed a grievance. The declaration, however, is not in- 
tended in any manner to deny the right or discourage the 
practice of the formation of labor unions or the joining of 
the same by the workers in said establishments, as guaran- 
teed in the preceding section, nor to prevent the war labor 
board from urging or any umpire from granting, under the 
machinery herein provided, improvement of their situation 
in the matter of wages, hours of labor, or other conditions, 
as shall be found desirable from time to time. 

Established safeguards and regulations for the protection 
of the health and safety of workers shall not be relaxed. 

If it shall become necessary to employ women on work 
ordinarily performed by men, they must be allowed equal 
pay for equal work, and must not be allotted tasks dispro- 
portionate to their strength. 

The basic eight-hour day is recognized as applying in all 
cases in which existing law requires it. In all other cases 
the question of hours of labor shall be settled with due re- 
gard to governmental necessities and the welfare, health and 
proper comfort of the workers. 

The maximum production of all war industries should be 
maintained, and methods of work and operation on the part 
of employers or workers which operate to delay or limit 
production, or which have a tendency to artificially increase 
the cost thereof, should be discouraged. 

For the purpose of mobilizing the labor supply with a 
view to its rapid and effective distribution, a permanent list 
of the numbers of skilled and other workers available in 



CREATING A DISPUTE 207 

different parts of the country shall be kept on file by the 
Department of Labor, the information to be constantly fur- 
nished (1) by the trade unions; (2) by state employment 
bureaus and federal agencies of like character; (3) by the 
managers and operators of industrial establishments through- 
out the country. 

These agencies shall be given opportunity to aid in the 
distribution of labor as necessity demands. 

In fixing wages, hours, and conditions of labor, regard 
should always be had to the labor standards, wage scales, 
and other conditions prevailing in the localities affected. 

The right of all workers, including common laborers, to 
a living wage is hereby declared. 

In fixing wages, minimum rates of pay shall be estab- 
lished which will insure the subsistence of the worker and 
his family in health and reasonable comfort.

CHAPTER VII 

REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 

TN the peaceful pressure of public opinion, there- 
* fore, and not in the application of legal or mil- 
itary force, lies the hope of terminating industrial 
conflicts. The solution of the industrial problem is 
to be found in industry itself. This does not mean 
that the leaders of industry will find this solution 
unaided. Their perspective is usually distorted by 
their nearness to their job. The tendency is for 
them to get buried under the machinery of their 
work. It is significant for our purpose to remember 
that almost never have the courts been reformed 
by lawyers, or the church by ministers, or medicine 
by physicians, or governmental machinery by office 
holders. This is likewise the fact even in science. 
The scientific principles like the law of conservation 
of energy and the mechanical equivalent of heat 
were not discovered by experts in physics. The 
reason why discoveries in organized activities are 
so frequently made, not by experts engaged in them, 
but by men with practical experience in wider fields, 
is because it is the lookers-on who see most of 
the game. 

The same principle applies to industry, though 
208 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 209 

not to the same extent. There is far more hope of 
free activity in industry than, for example, in gov- 
ernment. Industry appeals to a man's hope; gov- 
ernment appeals to his fear. Industry stimulates 
initiative; government punishes. Industry asks 
what can you do ; government states what you must 
not do. Therefore, in business there is ample justi- 
fication for the attitude of expectancy, for the hope 
that its leaders will respond to new ideas. 

It is apparent, therefore, that if managers and 
men are to make progress towards a solution of 
their own problem, they need the help of an agency 
like a community engineering board to guide them, 
to give them perspective, to do for them the work 
of social engineering. It is equally apparent that, 
if such a board is to make progress in securing a 
re-organization of industry, the result must be se- 
cured by operating through the managers and men, 
not apart from them. It is their business we desire 
to transform. To produce a mental revolution in 
them is the path to our desired goal. It is also 
apparent that, the essential nature of industrial ac- 
tivity predisposes those engaged in it to extend' 
mental hospitality to new ideas. The hope of in- 
dustry lies in industry itself. 

The three cardinal facts concerning managers and 
men in industry their dependence on outside guid- 
ance, the need for their free co-operation, and their 
capacity for open-mindedness all necessitate the 
conclusion that the result we aim at must be achieved 






210 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

by the method not of force, but of freedom. Un- 
less a man gives his inward consent to a cause he 
cannot be said to be enlisted in it at all. The recon- 
struction of modern industry must, therefore, be 
what J. A. Hobson calls a revolution by consent. 
It is a significant phrase for a highly significant 
idea, and suggests a social policy of uncalculated 
value for the immediate future. The suggestion is 
that a revolution can be best effected in modern 
industry by the peaceful process of persuading the 
possessing class to give their free consent to it. This 
suggested policy rests on the assumption that an 
appeal to hope is stronger than an appeal to fear, 
that the social conscience is not atrophied in the 
possessing classes, that it is possible for them to 
discover the injustice of one class living upon the 
enforced labor of another, and even to rebel against 
being a party to a system, which degrades their 
fellow men. 

Mr. Hobson gave currency to this phrase in his 
latest book. It was received with somewhat scorn- 
ful criticism on the ground that the policy recom- 
mended was impossible and Utopian. This is quite 
a natural criticism to come from those, who think 
only in terms of warfare. The criticism is not with- 
out a touch of humor, when we consider the bold 
and naive assumption that the critics' method of 
warfare now in operation, has been productive of 
practical results. I do not know what answer Mr. 
Hobson would make to his critics, but it is here 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 211 

suggested that he might have forestalled the criti- 
cism by answering it effectively before it was made. 

We are agreed that revolution by violence has 
been ineffective. Strikes, lockouts and political ac- 
tion are the methods of warfare, and while it is 
freely granted that they have been productive of 
some good in the past, they are not in any sense 
satisfactory. We are also agreed that an idea, 
if it can be gotten into general circulation, is the 
most dynamic weapon available for the defeat of 
injustice and the progressive realization of construc- 
tive purposes. The use of physical or political 
force only retards the cause in behalf of which 
they are employed. This has been demonstrated to 
the point of weariness. What Mr. Hobson did 
not mention, and his critics have not yet discovered, 
is the method by which to make effective an appeal 
to reason. An idea is not enough; it must be an 
organized community idea. To get results we need 
both a principle and a program. 

This is the amendment we would make to Mr. 
Hobson's proposed policy of securing revolution 
by consent, with which we are in enthusiastic accord. 
The attempt to secure the consent of the possessing 
class by an appeal to reason and justice, to be 
effective, must be made through the community and 
in behalf of the common welfare. The community 
principle is the key to its effectiveness. When any 
class, organized on the basis of its self-interest, 
makes an appeal, it is handicapped by the suspicion 






212 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

that it is animated by unworthy motives. But when 
an organized community finds its voice in an organ 
like a community engineering board, it speaks a 
dynamic and undiscounted word, a word with wings 
to it. The community as the spokesman in behalf 
of a reconstructed industry, can do more both for 
the working and the possessing class, than either 
class can do for itself. Revolution by consent is 
correct in principle. The community engineering 
board furnishes the program for putting it into 
effective operation. 

What is it to which we desire the capitalist to 
give his free consent? What is it, if he consented 
to it, that would revolutionize modern industry? 
He would the more readily consent to it, if he dis- 
covered it himself. What is it that we want him 
to discover? The answer to this question is so 
critically important that we should spare no pains 
in stating it accurately. For the sake of clarity, let 
us state it in terms of a possible experience. 

Let us suppose that the discovery is made by the 
president and part owner of a typical American 
factory. He is self-made and acts the part. He 
is healthy, accustomed to success, walks with the 
swing of victory. He employs driving methods. 
He is an individualist; thinks he has a right to do 
as he pleases with what he believes in his own. He 
resents opposition. He prides himself on being 
"practical." He is not devoid of sentiment, but 
holds it is bad policy to mix sentiment with business. 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 213 

His relation to his "hands" is a money relationship 
only and that ends it. He has had frequent experi- 
ence with strikes and lock-outs and always supposed 
he had come out a victor. He says he is able to 
take care of himself, thank you. 

But since the war he is not so sure. Just now 
he is worried. He is facing a new situation. The 
men are dissatisfied, suspicious, resentful. He is 
annoyed and puzzled. He feels isolated in his own 
plant. Being naturally a sympathetic man, it is pain- 
ful to be without the respect of his fellows. He 
thought he was self-sufficient, but finds he isn't. 
Wages, higher or lower, do not remove the trouble. 
He is bewildered. The thing is as real as his 
factory walls, but he can neither analyze nor explain 
it. The men are "soldiering" on the job. They 
go through the motions as usual, but the results are 
not as usual. The monthly production sheets reveal 
a serious condition. Production has fallen off 
twenty, thirty, forty per cent. This is ruinous to 
the business. It may be necessary to pass a dividend. 

He has arrived at the point of distress. He goes 
home every night with a mental headache. One 
night on leaving the office he spoke to the messenger 
boy, whose complete absorption in a book for days 
past at odd moments, he had noticed. "What are 
you reading, son," asked the manufacturer. "The 
greatest book in the world," answered the boy. 
"It's 'Robinson Crusoe.' I've read it three times 
already and I'm going to read it again. You ought 



214 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

to read it. Crusoe had lots of fun workin' in his 
island, makin' ink and cookin' tools and boats. 
You can take the book home, if you want to; I've 
just finished with it for this time." The man re- 
membered reading it as a boy, but had not thought 
it worth while to read since. Nevertheless he took 
the book home that night, not so much because he 
thought it had any contribution to make to the 
problem of work, as because he wanted an antidote 
for his mental headache, and thought he might find 
it in an escape back into the enthusiasms of his 
youth. 

He found more than he had expected. Reading 
the book now as a mature man and with his factory 
troubles as a background, was like a fresh revelation 
and an undiscovered country. He had searched for 
silver and found gold. For two evenings he was 
absorbed in reading the book, indulging himself 
with the refreshing spirit of adventure, the desire 
for which may be suppressed, but never killed in a 
normal man. He spent more evenings in serious 
reflection, for out of the book he got more than 
adventure; he got illumination on his problem. 

He made an attempt to state to himself what the 
book had suggested to him. Crusoe's adventure 
was an adventure about work. How can we tie 
work and adventure together? If, thought he, we 
can introduce into work the spirit of adventure, 
joy, self-directed activity, we can make some prog- 
ress with our problem. This is the challenge Cru- 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 215 

soe makes to me. I will look it squarely in the 
face, he said in his meditation, and extract its 
meaning. 

If my workmen were men like Crusoe, my prob- 
lem would be wholly different. Would I have any 
problem at all? Look at Crusoe there, working 
at his boat, sailing it out of his harbor, self-reliant, 
eager, expectant, absorbed in his work, doing it as 
if he loved it, feeling that it is his own work. What 
I need in my factory, is the Crusoe type of man. 
But how am I to get him? The key to this problem 
is the workman's attitude to his work. But how 
are we to create the right attitude? Crusoe looks 
as if he were ready to break out into singing as he 
works. But where is the singing man in my factory? 
He glares by his absence. If we can get men to 
feel like singing as they work, our problem is solved. 
But singing is an outward and visible sign of an 
inward and spiritual condition. We can't get sing- 
ing, until we change their state of mind. 

But if I had the Crusoe type of man, I would 
have to treat him very differently than I now treat 
my men. If I am to develop them into the Crusoe 
type, or retain them after I develop them, must 
not my treatment of them be on a different and 
higher basis? But is not this the natural right way 
to treat men, anyway? They are not on an intel- 
lectual equality with me, nor on a social equality 
with me, but are they not on a moral equality with 
me? This is a disturbing and revolutionizing idea. 



216 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

If the men are ever to change their attitude to 
their work, must not I change my attitude to them? 
Obviously, it is up to me. 

This is the first big idea I get from a study of 
the kind of man Crusoe was. But I cannot stop 
there. It means that these men have interests like 
mine. The same needs and desires and ambitions. 
The similarity is not always clearly apparent. Their 
desires are often dimly conceived and feebly ex- 
pressed. But they exist, and I wonder whether this 
is not the real cause of their unrest, even when 
they are unconscious of it. To be strictly honest, 
I confess I know some workmen who are my intel- 
lectual and moral superiors. But my workmen and 
I not only have like interests, but something more. 
We have common interests also. We are engaged 
in a common enterprise. Neither I nor they can 
be successful or happy in our work, without mutual 
aid and free co-operation. We rise and fall to- 
gether. We have a community of interest. I never 
put it that way before. I never recognized our 
interests as common. In fact, I have acted as if 
they weren't; as if these workmen were my natural 
enemies, whereas they are my natural allies. If 
that is so, then this constant conflict between us is 
nothing more nor less than a civil war, in which 
neither side can win; neither victor nor vanquished. 
Its continuance is suicidal. We are like horn-locked 
deer in the mountains, engaged in combat, in which 
an injury to either is an injury to both. How can 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 217 

civil war in industry be stopped, until we recognize 
our interests as common interests, and make this 
fact a working principle in the conduct of industry? 

After he had thus stated to himself these two big 
constructive ideas, he felt that he had his feet 
planted on a path which held out the promise of 
leading him to a solution of his problem. He ex- 
perienced the elation that comes from creative 
ideas. He resolved that he must talk over his new 
discovery with someone. It would be useless to 
talk with his superintendent. He was afflicted with 
a natural inability to take in new ideas. Moreover 
his attitude to the men was domineering, as is fre- 
quently the case with men who exercise delegated 
authority. But he could talk with his daughter. 
She had informed herself about the new community 
movement, whose chief doctrine was the develop- 
ment of the individual through self-activity. Then, 
too, she was a woman, whose function it is to be 
a creator and conserver of life, and was naturally 
more interested in the human factor in industry 
than in any other. 

His daughter responded with sympathetic under- 
standing to the news of her father's new outlook. 
She stimulated his dissatisfaction with things as they 
were, by accentuating the mutual advantages that 
the proposed new policy would produce. She was 
wise enough to know that the most helpful as well 
as the most effective criticism is criticism by con- 
struction. Her father sincerely agreed with her, 






218 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

but her intuition told her that his courage might not 
be quite equal to the task of translating his new 
vision into practice without a little external stimulus. 
She, therefore, suggested that he call into consul- 
tation a representative of the new profession of 
social engineering, to get from him the assurance 
that his newly discovered principles were quite prac- 
tical. This suggestion he approved, because while 
he had given his full inward consent to the princi- 
ples, which Had gripped him, his conception of what 
is "practical" had been so distorted that he found 
difficulty in adopting them as a business policy. 

The social engineer came, a strong up-standing 
man, who saw life steadily and saw it whole. He 
was a practical idealist. In his work he combined 
principles and their practice. He had made the 
great discovery that the questions involved in in- 
dustry, like all other big questions, have two sides 
which are opposite, but not contradictory. 

The manufacturer described to him the new and 
recent labor troubles in his factory, what had hap- 
pened to his outlook through the reading of "Robin- 
son Crusoe," the new vision he had seen, the dis- 
turbance it caused him, the possibility of putting it 
into operation. His report was made somewhat 
timidly, because he felt a lurking cowardice before 
the seeming admission that he was permitting senti- 
ment to influence a business problem. His daughter, 
who sat in on the conference, was quick to perceive 
this masculine weakness, and supplemented her 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 219 

father's statement, not because it needed it, but for 
the purpose of informing the social engineer that 
she was his ally, and to suggest that he was free to 
express his convictions without reservation. 

After listening with patience and understanding, 
asking a few questions to disclose the true inward- 
ness of the situation, he gave to the manufacturer 
his honest advice expressed in the following state- 
ment: 

"I congratulate you. Yours is the good fortune 
of an open mind. For any man with an open mind 
there is hope of finding a solution for his problems. 
It is because of your open-mindedness, that the read- 
ing of 'Robinson Crusoe 1 put you on the track of 
the two big discoveries you have made. It is an 
unusual and picturesque, and yet a perfectly simple, 
way of approach to these ideas. It is curious that 
a book which everybody thinks he knows, is very 
little known for what it really is. It challenges 
modern industry at its most vulnerable spot. It 
doesn't matter how you came by them, but it was a 
fortunate day for you, when you made these two 
discoveries : first, that everyone of your workmen is 
a possible Crusoe and must be treated as such to 
develop him into one; and, second, that the only 
way to develop them into Crusoes, and thereby in- 
crease production and decrease industrial civil war 
is to establish a community of principle between 
you and your workmen. 

"The two principles constitute one principle at 



220 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

heart and it is the basis on which modern industry 
everywhere must be reorganized, if it expects to 
have anything else but trouble. They are not only 
practical, but they are the only practicable principles 
there are. And for a very obvious reason; they are 
in harmony with human nature and the human factor 
is your biggest element in production. It is just the 
opposite of practical to run counter to human nature 
and yet this policy hitherto has been the common 
practice. To reverse this practice and assist in re- 
organizing industry on a sound and practical basis 
is one of the chief tasks of the new profession of 
social engineering. 

"I am glad you yourself made this discovery in 
time to save yourself unnecessary trouble. A de- 
cent respect for the opinion of mankind compels us 
to admit that industry is in serious need of recon- 
struction. The manufacturers, who refuse to see 
it are inviting trouble and are sure to get it. They 
ought to realize that it is not possible to reason with 
empty stomachs. It is futile to argue with the north 
wind. The best defense against the north wind, 
as Lowell said, is to put on your overcoat. The 
right time to cure trouble is before it happens, just 
as you are planning to do. The thing which puzzled 
you in the conduct of your workmen is something 
which has happened in Europe and America since 
the war, and which many leaders of industry have 
failed or refused to recognize. It is this : the work- 
man since the war, has become a new and different 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 221 

kind of man. Everywhere in Europe and America 
he has formulated his dissatisfaction. A new con- 
sciousness has taken possession of him. He has 
resolved on a final refusal any longer to be a machine 
and has acquired an undefeatable determination to 
play the part of a man in his work. This is the 
real cause of the present unrest. It is not so much 
a complaint against details of wages and working 
conditions, though it often takes this tangible form; 
it is the structure of industry that he challenges. 
He makes this challenge, because he has acquired 
a new mental attitude toward himself. He demands 
that we practice the great dictum of the philosopher 
Kant, 'Treat every man as an end to himself, not 
as a means to your ends.' The problem of modern 
industry therefore, is a human problem. 

"The resultant unrest is not a thing to be dis- 
turbed over or to combat, but to be welcomed. It 
means in my judgment an uncalculated advance in 
civilization and human progress. The wise manu- 
facturer will rejoice over the present unrest, and 
will capitalize it to serve his productive purposes. 
If these workmen want to play a bigger part in 
their work and exercise their initiative, why don't 
you let them? If you did, it would greatly increase 
the output and make more money, both for them 
and you. It will pay you financially. You ought 
not to do it primarily for this reason, but this will 
be a natural by-product of such a policy. It is the 
simple, right thing to do, but in the long run the 



222 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

thing which is morally right is the only thing, which 
is economically sound. 

"But the policy based on the two principles you 
have discovered will produce results still more fun- 
damental. For example. It will elevate your busi- 
ness to the status of a liberal profession. What 
is it that justifies us in classifying a profession as 
'liberal* ? The profession of minister and physician 
bear this label. A captain of industry should be 
classified with them, but he isn't, not to any con- 
siderable extent as yet. This is his natural position 
as Ruskin pointed out in his list of five professions 
related to the necessities of life: 

" 'The Soldier's profession is to defend life. 

" 'The Pastor's, to teach it. 

" 'The Physician's, to keep it in health. 

' 'The Lawyer's, to enforce justice in it. 

1 'The Merchant's, to provide for it. 
" 'And the duty of all these men is, on due occasion, 
to die for it. 

' 'The Soldier, rather than leave his post in battle. 

' 'The Physician, rather than leave his post in plague. 

' 'The Pastor, rather than teach falsehood. 

' 'The Lawyer, rather than countenance injustice. 
" 'The Merchant, what is his "due occasion" of death?' 

"Even the soldier, although his profession is an 
ugly, destructive and a morally contradictory busi- 
ness, is nevertheless accorded a special regard in 
men's thoughts, and for good reason. His service 
is given in behalf of a cause bigger than his personal 
interest, for which he is willing to spend the last 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 223 

full measure of his devotion. This is why we hang 
over our mantlepieces a sword or musket. Why 
do we not hang by their side a hoe, or yardstick or 
piece of machinery? The reason is obvious. There 
is one thing, and one alone, which can give to busi- 
ness the status of a liberal profession, and that is 
to introduce into it the element of public service as 
a controlling motive. In his 'Business a Profession' 
Mr. Justice Brandeis states the three distinguishing 
marks of a profession to be 'preliminary training, 
a calling pursued largely for others and not merely 
for one's self, and where the financial return is not 
the accepted measure of success.' These three are 
one. A liberal profession is a public service. We 
all recognize that a minister or physician should 
receive a decent compensation for his service, but 
if he should make profiteering his chief motive, he 
would immediately lose his status in the community. 
Shall we require the soldier and minister and physi- 
cian to work for the common welfare, and permit 
the merchant to work for his own? Is it not both 
his duty and privilege to sacrifice comfort and riches 
rather than do injury and injustice to his fellowmen, 
either his competitors or his workmen? The man 
who does so is just as heroic as the man who dies 
on the field of battle if not more so, for the cour- 
age to live heroically is more rare than the courage 
to die heroically. 

"When you have transformed your business into 
a liberal profession by adopting the policy we are 



224 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

discussing, you will then make a further discovery, 
namely, that you will get real joy out of your busi- 
ness. Merely to make money is not a big enough 
aim for an able American business man like your- 
self, and will never satisfy you. Whatever divi- 
dends of money your business yields, if it does not 
also yield some dividends of joy, the business cannot 
honestly be reckoned a success. If you miss joy you 
miss the Hamlet of life's drama. The real thing is 
found, not apart from your work, but through your 
work. I suggest that you open a new page in your 
ledger and head it 'Dividends of Joy,' and keep a 
careful account of this product. Please note that 
it cannot be bought with money. It is not a com- 
modity or a dower, but a personal achievement. It 
is a by-product of service. It comes only as the 
natural product of the manhood policy you plan to 
adopt. 

"You will notice that I have omitted to say any- 
thing about the detailed application of this policy. 
There's a reason. In any problem the place to begin 
is at the beginning. It is largely labor lost to at- 
tempt the application of anything until we first deter- 
mine what it is we aim to apply. Moreover you 
must accept this manhood principle, not because it 
pays, but because it is right. If you adopt it merely 
because it pays, you will not understand how to 
operate it, and you will defeat your own purpose. 
We will consider its application later, but at this 
point let me give you a formula for the practice of 



REVOLUTION BY CONSENT 225 

the principles you have stated. It is this: 'Stop 
making shoes and begin making men and let the 
men make the shoes.' The trouble with industry is 
that it is unbalanced. It has been operated by book- 
keepers instead of by engineers. The managers 
have thought almost exclusively of profits as they 
appeared on the books, and forgot the creators of 
the profits. The formula, I suggest, will restore the 
lost balance. It will produce more shoes, but it 
will do so only because the new policy enables the 
men to receive personal development and satisfac- 
tion in the process. I, therefore, earnestly urge 
you, as the first step toward a solution of your prob- 
lem, to make a decision and adopt the manhood 
principle as your future policy." 

Before the social engineer had finished these re- 
marks, the manufacturer's mental headache was 
gone and he had decided to adopt the new policy. 
He did it without reservation, because he did not 
in fact need to be convinced of the merit of the new 
policy. That was self-evident. What he needed 
was not advice, but confirmation. He also engaged 
the social engineer to assist him to put the new 
policy into operation. 

It is needless to add that before the social engi- 
neer's engagement in the factory was ended, he had 
contracted another with the manufacturer's daugh- 
ter, who had been his efficient ally in the inaugura- 
tion of the new policy. The event was a foregone 
conclusion through the operation of the law of 



226 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

natural selection. There was a time when her father 
had entertained the hope that she would marry his 
superintendent. But long ago he had seen how 
impossible it was of realization. The disparity of 
outlook between them on the conduct of the indus- 
try was too great. The moral issue involved in the 
industrial problem could not be confined to the fac- 
tory walls. It invaded his household. It would 
have produced a real separation in sympathy be- 
tween him and his daughter if he had not extended 
mental hospitality to the new idea. The ghost of 
this new idea had visited his fireside for years, and 
it no doubt had helped to equip him with insight to 
receive "Robinson Crusoe's" message. 

When he perceived what natural comrades his 
daughter and the social engineer were, he had 
pleasure in approving their engagement. Now he 
understood that similarity of mind and purpose was 
essential to success in marriage, just as a community 
of principle between him and his workmen was essen- 
tial for success in industry. After all, he thought, 
is not the extension of the family spirit to the fac- 
tory the real key to the solution of its problems? 



CHAPTER VIII 

A BILL OF PARTICULARS 

/ "T" V HE magical effect of the manufacturer's final 
* decision and spoken word to the social engi- 
neer, was immediately apparent. When he returned 
to his factory, he was a new man. His workmen 
at once perceived the change. Everywhere they 
asked, "What's come over the boss?" Their in- 
stinct told them something had happened. They 
could see it in his eye, in his attitude toward them, 
in his new respect for their personality. The trans- 
forming power of an idea had produced a new 
atmosphere in the factory. An atmosphere is as 
real as the shoes the men are making, and quite the 
most important item in a factory's equipment. It 
cannot be produced artificially, because it is a spir- 
itual product, and therefore must be genuine. A 
genuine mental revolution had taken place in this 
man. And a mental revolution in the owner meant 
a revolution by consent in the reorganization of his 
industry. He perceived that his new point of view 
was infectious and had half solved his problem 
before he had begun its detailed adjustment. In 
his judgment this fact furnished complete confirma- 
tion that he had chosen the right course of action. 
As he considered the application of the new 
227 



228 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

policy, it became clear to him that the manhood 
principle, if broken up into its constituent elements 
. for the sake of clarity, would logically mean such 
principles as these : Democracy applied to manage- 
ment; justice applied to profits; art applied to 
manual work; and leisure provided for personal 
growth. These are self-evident propositions. He 
had no hesitation about approving of them in prin- 
ciple. But he was an honest man; not a hypocrite. 
He resented the suggestion that he approve the 
new policy in principle, but deny it in practice. He 
started the search for a program. He began to 
formulate a bill of particulars for the actual opera- 
tion of the new policy. 

If, now, this man or any other captain of indus- 
try honestly desired a bill of particulars, organically 
related to the manhood principle, which he had mor- 
ally approved, what items should it contain? It is 
here suggested that it would contain four essential 
items, and that they are the sufficient and compre- 
hensive guides in his program of action. They are 
as follows: 

1. Treat capital and wages on the same basis. 
They are both things and the same kind of things 
and should be classified together. Reckon a fair 
dividend on invested capital and a fair living wage, 
as constituting merely two indispensable elements 
in the cost of production. The question of work- 
men is a basically different question and requires a 
different treatment. 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 229 

2. Divide net profits among owners and work- 
men. By workmen we mean all workers either with 
brain, or hand, or with both. There should be a 
dividend on wages as well as one on capital. After 
a fair basic dividend is paid on capital and a fair 
basic wage is paid for labor, and after a reserve 
fund is provided to offset the deterioration of build- 
ings and machinery, and a reserve fund provided to 
offset the deterioration of workmen during periods 
of enforced idleness, the net profit should be divided 
in a fair and fixed ratio between the capital invested 
and the workmen, the two sources from which the 
profit was produced. This is not a bonus given as 
a charity; nor is it a scheme of profit-sharing as a 
stimulus to production; it is a division of earnings 
as an act of justice between partners in a joint enter- 
prise. 

3. Put production for use in the first place and 
production for profit in the second place. This 
means the pride of workmanship in the product as 
a protection against the temptation against the hasty 
production of cheap and shoddy goods. This prin- 
ciple introduces the element of public service into 
the enterprise. It will help to insure a permanent 
market for the product with the consuming public. 
It will stimulate the element of joy in work, which 
has a direct bearing on production and labor turn- 
over. So far as it is possible to introduce the ele- 
ment of art into the process of work, it will be a 
safeguard against the spiritual blight of treadmill 



230 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

monotony, due to automatic machinery, which, now 
and during the next fifty years, will constitute one 
of the most serious and baffling of the problems of 
modern industry. 

4. Make workmen members of the organiza- 
tion in which they work. This will enable a work- 
man to feel that the work he is doing is his work, 
which means a new world for him. Responsibility 
and freedom should be riveted together. It is a 
moral contradiction to demand responsibility and 
not grant freedom to discharge it effectively. To 
secure a man's free cooperation, he must have a 
voice in the management. This proposed union of 
managers and men as members of the enterprise 
must be a real union, and not a "yellow union." It 
must be a union with power in it, otherwise work- 
men will keep the union they now have. There 
must be no joker in it, no tricks of any kind. They 
always act as a boomerang and delay progress. The 
German Diet before the war was called U A Hall of 
Echoes." Its members could talk all they pleased, 
but could do nothing. If in an industry a proposed 
democratic plan of cooperation provides that all 
questions shall be settled in the counting room and 
permits the workmen to do nothing but talk, this 
may do some good, but it will not meet the issue. 
Talk is good, but talk merely for talk's sake gets 
us no where. It must be responsible talk, that is, 
the discussion of questions concerning which the 
talkers are expected to take some action. It must 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 231 

be organic democracy, and not sham democracy. If 
the men are given a real part to play as members 
of the organization, the first obvious effect will be 
to end strikes, because men do not strike against 
themselves. This is a negative result but indispen- 
sable as the beginning of positive and creative 
achievements, which constitute the new policy's chief 
aim. 

This quartet of principles is not a complete bill 
of particulars; just the beginning of it. But they 
are basic and universally applicable in adapting the 
policy to the particular requirements of various in- 
dustries. A policy based on these principles would 
pay financially. When one reckons the frightful 
loss due to strikes and lock-outs and the decreased 
production caused by an armed neutrality state of 
mind in the workmen, it would pay handsomely. 
But it ought not to be adopted because it pays finan- 
cially. It ought to be adopted because it is right, 
and also because we want to reap some dividends 
of joy as well as dividends of money. It would be 
a wise policy whether it paid financially or not. The 
manufacturer, who gets out of his business nothing 
but dividends in money is cheating himself and 
doesn't know it. 

The proposed new policy is simple. It is not 
complex, but it is difficult. Its operation will require 
patience, thoughtful adaptation to a great variety 
of details, expert knowledge of human nature, edu- 
cation of owners, managers and workmen, sincerity 



232 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

on the part of leaders, mental hospitality to new 
ideas. These requirements make it difficult, but 
the policy itself is quite simple. Its difficulty finds 
ample compensation in the fascination of doing 
creative work of this type. 

It is because the work is new and difficult that it 
calls for the service of the new profession of social 
engineering, which is now being created to meet the 
need for it. Men like Gantt, Steinmetz, Wolf, 
Polakov and Leitch are pioneers in it. They do 
not call themselves by the new title, social engineers, 
but this is the type of work they have been doing. 
This profession is destined to be of great national 
importance, and to rank as a liberal profession 
alongside of that of a physician, a minister, and a 
lawyer. 

It is essential to make a clearly marked distinction 
between a social and an efficiency engineer. The 
work of efficiency engineering is concerned with 
book-keeping, handling of materials and machines, 
elimination of waste motions and other questions of 
detail. These are important details, but they are 
details. On the contrary the social engineer deals, 
not with details primarily, but with policies. He 
treats the basic question in industry. His work is 
that of industrial statesmanship. Of course all 
good titles are so speedily spoiled by loose and care- 
less usage, that we need not waste time by insisting 
on their accurate use, so long as we have a clear 
conception of the two types of work. In practice 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 233 

they will doubtless tend to overlap, for there can 
be no real efficiency, while basic defects of policy 
continue. But no one ought to deceive himself by 
confusing the two types of work. 

Failure to make this simple distinction is so com- 
mon, and is so frequently a designed failure, that 
it will be helpful to make it clear by a pointed illus- 
tration. The test of sanity in some asylums is to 
take the patient to a trough, partially filled with 
water, and into which an open spigot pours new 
supplies of water. The patient is asked to bail the 
water out of the trough. If he attempts to do so 
without first turning off the flow, he is regarded as 
insane, and properly so. Efficiency engineering, as 
hitherto understood, assumed that a workman was 
a machine and concerned itself with the kind of 
vessel to be used in bailing out the water, the method 
of using the fewest motions, and similar questions 
of mechanical detail. On the other hand the social 
engineer, assumes that a workman is a human being, 
and concerns himself with the task of turning off 
the spigot, preventing troubles by dealing with their 
source of supply, eliminating the fundamental de- 
fects of the industrial type of work, and is so obvi- 
ously sane that the probability is that efficiency 
engineering will in the near future develop into 
social engineering, which is as it should be, for then 
we will have real efficiency for the first time. 

This hopeful outlook inspired the significant reso- 
lution recently adopted by the Federation of Ameri- 



234 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

can Engineering Societies, of which Herbert Hoover 
was elected the first president. It is as follows : 

"Engineering is the science of controlling the 
forces and of utilizing the materials of nature for 
the benefit of man, and the art of organizing and 
of directing human activities in connection there- 
with. 

"As service to others is the expression of the 
highest motive to which men respond and as duty 
to contribute to the public welfare demands the best 
efforts men can put forth, 

"Now, THEREFORE, the engineering and allied 
technical societies of the United States of America, 
through the formation of the Federated American 
Engineering Societies, realize a long cherished ideal 
a comprehensive organization dedicated to the 
service of the community, state and nation." 

The aim of other engineers, as this resolution 
indicates, is to develop material resources and use 
the human factor as a means to this end, but a social 
engineer's aim is to develop human resources and 
use the material factor as a means to this end. The 
two types of engineers have much in common and 
their work is harmonious, but the approach to their 
tasks is quite distinct and different. The fact that 
other engineers have recognized the necessity of 
directing human activities from the standpoint of 
public service in order to make their work effective, 
is a striking indication of the need for the new pro- 
fession of social engineering. 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 235 

Inasmuch as social engineering deals with funda- 
mental issues, it will be observed that the bill of 
particulars made no mention of labor unions. A 
labor union is not a fundamental issue but a detail. 
It aims to secure fundamental results, but its exist- 
ence or non-existence is not a basic question. It is 
an effect, not a cause. A union, like every other 
organization, is a means to an end, not an end in 
itself. By far too much is made over labor unions, 
both by capitalists and by workmen themselves. 
They both ought to center their attention on the 
real issues at stake. Most of the talk about unions 
is camouflage. The claim of some manufacturers 
that they have a right to organize for their own 
benefit, and their workmen have not, is nothing but 
comedy, if it is not something worse. It is a sug- 
gestion that the impartial public cannot recognize 
as worthy even of consideration. 

The attempt to carry on a war of extermination 
against labor unions is surprisingly stupid, as well 
as futile. It is the evidence either of an inexcusable 
ignorance of history and human nature, or an un- 
willingness to face the issues they raise. Labor 
unions are neither to be feared nor fought, but 
recognized with gratitude in spite of their defects. 
They are the most effective agencies we have for 
genuine Americanization, for they operate on the 
American ideals of free association, free speech and 
free action. In the light of their history and 
achievement, it would be nothing short of a calamity 



236 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

to the progress of human decency in general and to 
the American experiment at democracy in particular, 
if they should go out of existence, at least at present. 

The facts it seems to me make this the only fair- 
minded as well as the only wise attitude to take 
towards labor unions. Such an attitude received 
forceful expression in the progressive and states- 
manlike report recently issued by the New Jersey 
Chamber of Commerce. It says: "A movement is 
now on foot which, misusing the name of 'open 
shop' and 'American plan/ is smashing labor organ- 
izations throughout the country by locking the 
unions out and forcibly deunionizing the workman. 
Together with the abuses of unionism this move- 
ment is destroying the constructive substance of 
unionism and stifling the just democratic aspirations 
of the workmen. It is undermining the confidence 
of labor in employers and ruining the foundation 
for co-operation between them. Similar campaigns 
in former periods of depression have resulted only 
in redoubled growth of unionism and the adoption 
by it of more extreme measures in the periods of 
prosperity which followed and there is no reason 
to believe that the results of this campaign will be 
different. Campaigns of this nature are leading to 
oppression by employers and are playing into the 
hands of revolutionary elements. Thus the cycle 
continues with the participants in continuous and 
senseless warfare." 

This would be the universal opinion, if it were 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 237 

not for the state of war existing between organized 
capitalists and organized workmen. War is always 
the fruitful mother of prejudice. When warfare 
is replaced by cooperation, the owners and managers 
will support labor unions and assist them in work- 
ing out the big constructive social program, which 
the labor guilds once operated in Europe. 

In case we desired to abolish labor unions, there 
is one simple and effective method of doing it, a 
method with which workmen everywhere would be 
in agreement. It is to remove the reason for their 
existence. If this were done, attendance at their 
meetings would naturally diminish and they would 
go out of existence. Their members would not want 
them to continue, if they cease to have any cause to 
serve. Labor unions originated and now exist to 
work for the establishment of the manhood prin- 
ciple as an industrial policy, which means a just 
distribution of earnings, decent living conditions, a 
chance for joy in work and an opportunity for self- 
expression. The effort of workmen in behalf of 
this cause can never cease until they cease to be men 
or until God is dead. To them this cause has be- 
come a religion, as in fact it is. To expect them 
to abandon organized effort in its behalf, is the 
same as it would be to ask a father to abandon all 
effort in behalf of his own child's welfare. Let us 
be done with foolish and insincere talk about de- 
tails. Let us talk about the question itself. We 
are not cowards; why should there be any sugges- 



238 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

tion of fear to face it. It is as big and fascinating 
as life itself. 

This then is the nature of a bill of particulars 
for the operation of the manhood principle in indus- 
try. I have an intuition that at this point some 
reader has a strong impulse to rise to a point of 
information. He says: I thought a bill of particu- 
lars meant a detailed account of how the new policy 
operated in particular factories. Is it your plan 
to give such an account? I would say to my hypo- 
thetical questioner that what he asks for is not a 
bill of particulars on the policy itself. I have al- 
ready given that. What he asks for is a report or 
survey of some one's experiment with it, a very 
different thing. Such a report may reveal only an 
approximation to the policy, or a variety of adapta- 
tions of it, or it may be a distortion of it, or it may 
only reveal some manager's capacity or incapacity 
to understand it. I would also ask my questioner 
to note carefully that the importation into industry 
of certain democratic forms borrowed from politics, 
where they have not been a conspicuous success, 
are only stepping-stones toward our goal. Unless 
democracy in industry is some improvement over the 
type now in operation in politics, it will not get us 
far. I would also warn my questioner against the 
temptation and common practice to use the request 
for a survey as the means of side-stepping a moral 
responsibility. 

With these three safeguards in mind, I would say 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 239 

that accounts of the attempts to operate democracy 
in industry by the method of trial and error are 
most helpful and stimulating. I refer my ques- 
tioner to two recent books. First, the enterprising 
and suggestive book by John R. Commons, and his 
collaborators, called "Industrial Government," 
which describes eighteen various experiments with 
democracy in industry. Second, the illuminating 
book by Ray Stannard Baker, called "The New 
Industrial Unrest," which describes several more 
interesting experiments and triumphs of industrial 
democracy, together with a penetrating and whole- 
some analysis of the present unrest in industry. 

I confess that I had planned to include a descrip- 
tion of the operation of the new policy in six typical 
trials of it, three from my own experience, and 
three from that of others. I had intended to de- 
scribe the operation of the new policy as it has been 
partially adopted in the settlement which ended the 
recent coal strike in England. This settlement pro- 
vided for the establishment of a national wage pool, 
the acceptance of a material cut in wages, the divi- 
sion of surplus profits in the ratio of eighty-three 
per cent, to the coal hewers and seventeen per cent, 
to the mine owners. The immediate result of the 
plan was an increase in production to a point higher 
than before the strike, in spite of the fact that one 
hundred thousand fewer men are employed and two 
hundred pits have not been reopened. This is an 
astonishing result. It is unexpected, but not at all 



240 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

surprising. That justice is economically profitable 
ought not to be a surprising discovery. It would 
not be, if men had not usually refused to do the 
right thing until they had guarantees about results. 
But it ceases to be right, and becomes merely 
enlightened selfishness, if done for the sake of 
guarantees, and, moreover, there is no way of dis- 
covering what the result will be without the venture 
of courage to do the simple right. 

Therefore, for the sake of this discussion I have 
concluded, that it would be more helpful to omit 
all reports on the operation of the new policy. I 
am most desirous of avoiding the common danger 
of diverting our attention from the policy itself by 
a consideration of its details. I am writing this 
book to make a simple, clear statement, divorced 
from learned complexities, of the manhood prin- 
ciple as an industrial policy, and as the only possible 
solution of the industrial problem. There are so 
very few books which state the issue for debate in 
modern industry, that it seems wiser for us to do 
no fishing up side streams, but keep to the main 
current of our discussion. The industrial war is 
so suicidal in its waste of money and good-will, and 
so big with consequences for the national welfare, 
that we should spare no pains in the attempt to 
discover what the war is about. Is it not a curious 
tragi-comedy of modern history that we have per- 
mitted the industrial civil war to proceed on its 
destructive course for so long a period without mak- 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 241 

ing any attempt to discover its fundamental cause? 
Certainly there is little hope of finding a remedy 
unless we do discover the real cause and acquire the 
courage to face it. 

There is a still further fundamental reason for 
omitting the reports on the successful operation of 
the new policy. I want to utilize the omission to 
make emphatic my conviction that the manhood 
principle needs no demonstration. It is not the 
kind of thing to be demonstrated, but the kind of 
thing to be discovered and accepted. I am not 
stating the manhood principle as an opinion or an 
invention, or a theory; I am announcing it as the 
discovery of a formula of economics, a law of 
human society which any man may discover for 
himself. It is a self-evident proposition. It is an 
organic law of the universe, and therefore rests on 
observation and experience. It is like the law of 
gravitation, which needs no demonstration. You 
do not collect reports on the number of men who 
broke their legs by walking off high buildings and 
steep embankments before you conclude that you 
ought to co-operate with the law of gravitation. 
Just as "nature is governed only by obeying her" 
so human nature is controlled only by respecting 
her laws of behaviour. The manhood principle 
is manifestly a difficult law to follow. So is truth- 
telling; but you would not dare to commend lying 
not in public because truth-telling is imperfectly 
practiced. So is manhood suffrage ; but because a 



242 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

large proportion of qualified voters fail to exercise 
this right, we do not propose to surrender what it 
has taken centuries of struggle to achieve. So are 
the Ten Commandments; but because as yet they 
are nowhere in perfect operation, we do not mean 
to abandon our effort to make them the laws of the 
social order. 

If you still insist on a demonstration of the man- 
hood principle in industry, all you need to do is to 
look back over the industrial history of the past 
one hundred fifty years. The validity of an organic 
law is demonstrated quite as much by its infraction 
as by its observance. The penalties resulting from 
its violation constitute its sanctions. The disastrous 
results from the failure to practice the manhood 
principle during the past one hundred fifty years, 
and still apparent everywhere, furnish all the demon- 
stration any wise man needs. It is demonstration 
to the point of monotony. The burden of proof 
is not on the man who says that two plus two equals 
four; but on the man who denies it. The man who 
has attempted to prove that two plus two equals 
something else than four, and has failed in the 
attempt, has thereby demonstrated that two plus 
two must of necessity equal four. I do not know 
why it is so, but I know that the kind of universe 
we are now living in is so constructed that it is so. 
The manhood principle is a law like the laws of 
heat and light and electricity. No man made them 
and no man can unmake them. He can only adjust 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 243 

himself to them and prosper, or he can mal-adjust 
himself to them, and take responsibility for the 
results. It is wiser, also safer, frankly to acknowl- 
edge that it is impossible to circumvent God. 

I said just now that I am announcing this law of 
economics as a discovery which any man may make 
for himself. The hopeful thing is that a few leaders 
of industry, perhaps more than we realize, are 
beginning to make it. Thomas E. Mitten, of Phila- 
delphia, for example, has made it. He said re- 
cently: "The only big thing I did was to make a 
discovery a discovery which a good many people 
have made before me but which has not generally 
been applied to the rapid transit game. I discov- 
ered that 10,000 men could do much more than a 
dozen, especially if the 10,000 were on the job while 
the dozen were not. The best board of directors 
on earth cannot run a railroad. The only way a 
railroad can be run is through co-operation." 

He stated the same discovery in the form of three 
principles, thus: "First, that the primary purpose 
of a public service corporation is to give public serv- 
ice, and without such service none but thieves can 
benefit. Second, that the successful running of a 
railroad depends most upon the men who run the 
railroad, and these human beings are of more im- 
portance than dividends. Third, capital cannot get 
an adequate return for its investment, it cannot, in 
fact, get any return unless these principles are 
observed. Financiers may and sometimes do get 



244 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

rich by other methods, just as burglars may run 
away with your silverware, but what they get in 
that case is not dividends but swag." 

It ought not to be surprising; it ought to go with- 
out saying that these principles produced their natu- 
ral and logical results. When Mr. Mitten became 
president of the rapid transit company, the condi- 
tion of things he found as stated by Charles W. 
Wood, was as follows: "The system broken down; 
the cars and equipment obsolete; the employees sul- 
len and discontented, and the company's credit so 
exhausted that it was impossible to meet a raise of 
one-half cent per hour which had been agreed upon 
in the settlement of a violent strike." 

After operating his principles a few years the 
condition of things today is as follows: "Transit 
service was doubled; the accident list was cut in two; 
the whole system was re-equipped with cars; divi- 
dends began to be paid; the wages of employees 
jumped from 23 cents an hour to 72 (voluntarily 
reduced last year to 64) ; and, when banking in- 
terests which had once brought the road to ruin 
called a halt, men and management dislodged the 
bankers from the board of directors, elected a 
board composed of managers and employees in- 
stead, and now guarantee 6 per cent, dividends to 
stockholders and promise a 10 per cent, salary 
dividend to all employees." 

Is it not significant that approaching the labor 
problem from the standpoint of history and a 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 245 

knowledge of human nature and the impartial ex- 
perience of a social engineer as I have done, and 
that Mr. Mitten approaching it from the stand- 
point of the internal operating necessities of a big 
industry, should both have arrived at exactly the 
same conclusions? The significance lies in the fact 
that these conclusions issue from principles that are 
self-evident truths, obvious to all who want to see. 
They require no proof. No amount of practical 
business experience would have enabled Mr. Mitten 
to produce the remarkable results he has achieved. 
His predecessors had abundant business experience. 
Mr. Mitten's achievement is the result of his dis- 
covery. This discovery is the load-star of modern 
industry. And when a considerable number of in- 
dustrial leaders make the same discovery, the labor 
question will cease to be a problem and become an 
opportunity, as it has to Mr. Mitten. To him his 
business is his chief recreation. 

What I am seeking to make clear is that our 
immediate major concern is not to continue making 
surveys of the industrial war, but to begin making 
searches for a way to terminate it. We have had 
surveys enough, one hundred and fifty years of 
them. We've been surveyed and re-surveyed; what 
we now need is suggested remedies. The time has 
come to adopt the slogan, "Don't count the enemy; 
beat him." Suggested remedies would have real 
news value. We have had front page reports on 
the industrial war with reiterated monotony. But 



246 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

some ideas on the way out of the industrial disorder 
would be a new kind of news fresh news, good 
news, constructive news. 

All discussions and activities in this field can be 
grouped under three descriptive captions, things as 
they are ; things as they ought to be ; how to change 
things as they are into things as they ought to be. 
Under the first, we get reports of conflicts, strikes, 
disorders; under the second, Utopian dreams. You 
can secure front page space for the first type of 
story, and even for the second type of story, if it 
is fantastic enough, but especially for the first. A 
young modern reporter was once asked, "If you 
were given two assignments for a news story, one 
to Hell and one to Heaven, and if you wanted 
to make sure that your story would be accepted, 
which one would you take?'* He answered, "I 
would take the assignment to Hell. Heaven has 
no news value, but Hell is full of it." He knew the 
kind of wares his market wanted. 

It is this kind of news with which we have been 
chiefly concerning ourselves. But we have had 
enough news from Hell. What we need is some 
news about a way of escape from it. That would 
be news with some point to it and a touch of fresh- 
ness on it. Anyone can see things as they are, and 
anyone can dream about things as they ought to 
be, but how to change them is the difficult and con- 
structive job. News about that is what ought to 
concern us now. The manhood principle, as the 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 247 

new policy for the reorganization of industry, is 
here offered as having this new type of news value. 
Bold and clear thinking on this task is our present 
national need. To search for this kind of news and 
debate it is the challenge, which our need makes to 
newspapers, magazines, and public forums. When 
Socrates was asked: "How do you get to Mount 
Olympus," he answered, "By doing all your walk- 
ing in that direction." The time has come to turn 
our faces away from the past one hundred and fifty 
years, and direct our thinking towards tomorrow 
in a search for the way out of things as they are. 

To indicate how feasible is the application of the 
new policy, when once its main principle is discov- 
ered and accepted, whatever the skill and patience 
required for its execution, I will describe its appli- 
cation to a sugar plantation, because the conditions 
are primitive, and exhibit its elements in bold relief. 
On a recent visit to the Pan-Pacific Educational Con- 
ference at Honolulu, I was invited to do some social 
engineering work in the islands. Among other 
things, I was asked to examine and make suggestions 
on the welfare work in a certain sugar plantation. 
I suppress its name out of courtesy, because my 
recommendations are now before its board of di- 
rectors. 

On this plantation there are four large and ex- 
pensive types of welfare work in operation, for it 
covers twelve thousand acres and involves seven 
thousand persons. With the leader of one of these 



248 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

enterprises as a guide, I examined them all. With 
the plantation's manager, I visited the large sugar 
mill and a few of the forty camps on the place. 
Then to lunch at the palatial residence of the man- 
ager in the center of the plantation. During the 
luncheon, he requested me to state my conclusions 
about the welfare work. I answered that so far 
as it goes, it seemed to me to be very good. This 
woman in charge of one piece of it, is doing the 
best she can. I made to her four suggested improve- 
ments, but they were only improvements in details. 
I rejoice over every good effort being made, and I 
think I better not go further than that today. "Oh, 
yes, you will," he said, u we are not entirely satisfied 
with our work, and we want your honest criticism; 
also your suggestions for improvement.'* 

I never saw a finer exhibition of the fact that the 
nature of all welfare work is determined by eco- 
nomic conditions. Community workers are com- 
pelled to deal with industrial problems, whether 
they wish to or not, unless they are content that 
their work shrivel up into mere "uplift" work, and 
cease to have any constructive value. At that time 
in Hawaii, a strenuous effort was being made to 
influence congress to permit the importation of 
cheap Chinese contract laborers, and the propa- 
ganda in its behalf was of such a kind, that it was 
quite dangerous for anyone to express an opinion, 
if it did not harmonize with that of the financial 
masters of the islands. In fact, everyone either 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 249 

expressed agreement or kept quiet. I did not hesi- 
tate on this account, because long ago I adopted the 
policy that I would "never sell the truth to serve 
the hour," but I wanted to test the manager. 

After he requested my honest criticism, I asked, 
u Are you a man of courage?" He said, "I am." 
Desiring confirmation from headquarters, I asked 
his wife: "Is he telling me the truth?" She said, 
"He is." "Very well, then," I said, "I will tell 
you. Your welfare work cannot be better than it 
is, because your industrial policy is what it is. Your 
entire policy is wrong, and not only wrong, but 
stupidly wrong." "That sounds refreshing," he 
said. "I realize," I answered, "that the word 
'stupidity' has a harsh sound, but it is the only word 
that fits. What impresses me most about you own- 
ers and managers, is not what you are suffering, but 
what you are losing. You are spending large sums 
as you told me, on motion pictures. Most of the 
people do not attend; those who do attend think 
you are trying to put something over on them. This 
is true of all your uplift work. It is wasted effort 
for the most part. It is very good of its type, but 
the type is wrong. It fails to do what it is designed 
to do. You need five hundred more men and can't 
get them. There's a reason why you can't, and it 
is a removable cause. Then there is a continuous 
silent strike in progress. This gives you not more 
than fifty per cent, production. This is your big 
loss. When you are needlessly wasting money and 



250 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

losing money, please suggest an adjective, which 
describes your policy, if 'stupid' seems unfair." 

u Do you mean to suggest," he said, "that we 
ought to install an entirely new policy?" "I cer- 
tainly do," I answered. "You owners and managers 
are most courteous and attractive people, but your 
industrial policy is nothing but feudalism. It is un- 
American and economically unsound." "Could you 
give me," he asked, "a bill of particulars for your 
suggested new policy?" "Certainly," I said. I had 
never seen a sugar plantation before, but the defects 
in the policy in operation were so obvious, that a 
blind man could see them, and the changes required 
by the manhood policy could have been suggested 
by anyone, who had discovered the principle of it. 
The manager is an honest and open-minded man. 
After going thoroughly over the new policy with 
him, he asked me to reduce it to writing, so that he 
could submit it to his directors. It is as follows, 
and it illustrates a few of the obvious items in the 
operation of the 

MANHOOD PRINCIPLE APPLIED TO A 
PLANTATION 

Causes of Trouble 

1. Within the limits of the policy now in operation much 
good work is being done, which I gladly recognize and re- 
joice over. But the policy is fundamentally wrong. 

2. Most of the money now spent in welfare work is 
wasted because it does not accomplish the object aimed at. 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 251 

3. Much money is also lost because you are getting only 
about fifty per cent., certainly not more than seventy-five 
per cent., of the production you ought to get, could get, and 
are entitled to get. A silent strike is more or less in progress 
all the time. 

4. There is a wall of suspicion between management and 
men. The connection between the laborer's hand and his 
brain and heart has been broken. You are working with 
pieces of men. 

5. The men are treated as cogs in a wheel, with no 
chance to play the part of men in their work. They are no 
longer content to have merely a wage relation to the plan- 
tation. 

6. Labor is degraded by being treated as unskilled. There 
is no such thing as unskilled labor, for there is no kind of 
work which could not be made more productive and enjoy- 
able by devising better ways of doing it. 

7. Your system is feudalism and is one hundred and fifty 
years behind the times. Democracy has been introduced into 
government, but not yet into industry. The trouble is, 
therefore, much deeper than a question of wages. It is a 
question of human welfare. 

The Way Out 

1. If the above is a correct diagnosis of the trouble, the 
remedy is quite obvious. It is to remove the cause. You 
need not so much the importation of more cheap laborers, 
but the importation of a new policy. More cheap labor is 
no solution, but an aggravation. Cheap Chinese labor may 
bring you some relief tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow 
your condition will be the same, and probably worse. If 
you do get more cheap labor, you will need the new policy 
more than before. 

2. This means a dividend on wages just as you have a 



252 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

dividend on capital. Your two essential items in the busi- 
ness are capital and labor. Fix a basic and just return on 
both ; in one case it is a dividend, in the other it is a wage. 
Regard both as operating expense with the other expenses. 
Anything made beyond this is profit. It should be distrib- 
uted proportionately between capital and wages. 

3. Such distribution of profits is not only just, but will 
make more money for the management and men. It will 
have a marked influence on the attitude of the men towards 
their work, and on their efficiency in it. Naturally they 
will work harder and prevent waste, because it will in- 
crease the profits, in which they will then have a share. 

4. There ought to be a series of regular conferences be- 
tween management and men for council and discussion. This 
will not only create a good morale by improving the men's 
self-respect, but will call forth many suggestions for im- 
provement in methods of work. 

5. The forty camps on the plantation should be concen- 
trated into ten, in order to make units big enough to be 
operated advantageously. 

6. The men should own their houses and pay for them. 
This will give them one spot, at least, where they could 
have freedom for initiative and self-expression, working at 
their houses and gardens, planting a tree and playing with 
flowers. 

7. Organize and operate a house-owning plan, by which 
you build and sell houses or by which the man builds and 
owns his own house. If he leaves, he can sell the house 
back to you, and you can re-sell it to another. 

8. The term "camp" should be changed to "village." In 
each village there should be a schoolhouse, built by public 
money. The land for it would have to be owned by the 
territory. It should be a community type of schoolhouse, in 
order to be available as a center of social activities for all 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 253 

adults and youths. You may have to supplement the public 
funds by a small amount to get this type of building. 

9. This will give you ten school teachers, supported at 
public expense, who could, at the same time, be directors of 
social activities, for which the people themselves would take 
responsibility. 

10. You could thus dispense with all your uplift work 
now in operation. The time for this type of work has gone 
by. It is morally hurtful to the men, as well as futile. You 
will need only one good man to direct the work of the ten 
teachers. 

11. The above items are sufficient to show that the new 
policy would save much money. It would greatly increase 
production, which is the big item of saving. In addition, it 
would save most of the money you now spend in uplift 
work. Moreover, your directors would no longer feel the 
need of giving "conscience money" to charity, because there 
would be little or no need for charity. The suggested new 
policy operates on the principle of self-help. 

12. The policy here suggested considers equally the benefit 
both to management and men, which are like two sides of 
one and the same shield and must be treated together; 
neither one can prosper alone. What is not good for the 
hive is not good for the bee. 

How to Start 

1. The right and wise thing to be done seems clear 
enough; how to do it is the difficulty. But it can be done, 
because it has been. It is now operated in many places 
with marked success. 

2. The new policy is not a mechanical device, but a human 
activity. Therefore, it has to be installed slowly and pa- 
tiently. Each item of the program has to be first consid- 



254 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

ered carefully by the directors until they understand and 
heartily approve. The same process has to be used with the 
men. It would perhaps take three months to start it. 

3. To install the new policy you need a social engineer 
from outside, who makes a special business of this work. I 
am not certain that I can spare the time to install it for 
you, as you kindly suggested you might want me to do, 
although I would be glad to do it, because this is a depart* 
ment of our National Community Board's w r ork, and the 
one in which I am most interested. But whether or not I 
shall be able to leave my other duties, I shall gladly give 
you all the help I can. 

4. Your labor problem at bottom is essentially the same 
as it is in Europe and Continental America, differing only 
in detail. The unrest is due to the awakened and deep 
desire of men to be treated like men and to play a part in 
their own work. It is as useless to fight it as to fight the 
law of gravitation. Moreover, we ought to rejoice in it, 
because we can capitalize it and use it to yield big dividends 
in money and happiness, both for management and men. 
If you will adopt the policy here proposed, you need not 
waste any more money in trying to secure favors from the 
Congress at Washington. The key to the solution of your 
problem is in your own hands. 

It will be observed that every item in this sug- 
gested program is a simple and logical consequence 
of the central principle, on which the program is 
built. A program like this cannot be adopted, nor 
successfully operated, if adopted, until the manhood 
principle is discovered and understood. This is to 
say that the issue before modern industry is a clean 
cut issue between the manhood principle and the 



A BILL OF PARTICULARS 255 

commodity principle. It is not a question of 
mechanics, but of morals; a question of making our 
policy fit the facts of human nature. It is not a 
question of altruism, but of the scientific treatment 
of facts. Robert Briffault speaks sober sense when 
he says : "The necessity of ethical considerations 
is no other than the hard necessity of adaptation 
of facts as they are. There are in the relations 
between man and man conditions which are, and 
others which are not adapted to actual facts. The 
unadapted result in failure, the adapted in evolu- 
tionary growth and life." Not until the commodity 
principle is once for all discarded and the manhood 
principle freely accepted, will our industrial policy 
be in accord with the facts, on which the universe 
is constructed. When this occurs, we may hope for 
an end of industrial war, and the beginning of a 
new industrial order. 



CHAPTER IX 

NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 

A LMOST every nation at its birth consciously 
-*** or unconsciously has adopted some big for- 
mative principle which shaped its organization, 
influenced the nature of its various activities and 
determined the worth of its contribution to prog- 
ress. In Palestine it was religion; in Greece it was 
culture; in Rome it was law; in America it is what? 

Fortunately the answer to this question is in no 
doubt. The origin of other nations lie hidden in 
the mists of a dim and distant past clouded by 
mythical traditions. The story of ours is distin- 
guished by this significant circumstance, that it lies 
wholly in the field of modern history, with all the 
facts exposed to view and with a clearly defined 
purpose. Its formative and creative purpose is the 
enfranchisement of manhood, the development of 
the individual, making available for the many what 
once was confined to the few, lifting artificial bur- 
dens from all shoulders, giving to each a fair chance 
in the race of life. 

The United States opened a new road to political 
freedom and started an experiment in democracy of 
vast consequence to the welfare of mankind. Our 

256 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 257 

present difficult task is to keep the road open, but 
we must do more. We have discovered that we 
must secure industrial freedom, if we would preserve 
our political freedom. We must re-establish indus- 
trial democracy, not only for its own sake, but to 
save our political democracy from wreckage. Our 
unfinished business is to create a new industrial 
America. The challenge of this unfinished task was 
recently presented to America by a well-known in- 
dustrial leader from Europe. Mr. B. Seebohm 
Rowntree is one of the most successful and liberal- 
minded manufacturers of England. He is an indus- 
trial statesman. On his recent tour of the United 
States to inspect our industrial development, he was 
courteous enough to say that he had received some 
helpful suggestions; he was also courteous enough 
not to say in which respects England was more pro- 
gressive than we are, although it was obvious that 
he could have named them. 

There was one statement made to him before 
sailing for home, which impressed him more than 
everything else he heard or saw on his visit, and it 
opened up for him the vision of a constructive pol- 
icy in advance of any of the reforms he had already 
established in his own factory. It was a statement 
by Robert B. Wolf, a pioneer of the new social 
engineering type. It is as follows: u Let the worker 
participate in the financial rewards of industry, and 
he may have his sense of justice satisfied; let him 
be insured against sickness, unemployment and old 



258 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

age and he may develop contentment of a sort; but 
only when the industrial processes are organized 
so that every worker becomes a conscious creator, 
so that his creative powers are released and he 
forgets all other considerations in the joy of the 
job, will the true greatness of our industrial system 
be understood." "That to me," said Mr. Rown- 
tree, u is the most inspiring word I heard in America. 
I believe it is the message of New America to the 
world. It is a message I want to carry back to 
England and I hope to induce Mr. Wolf to bring 
it personally." Mr. Wolfs statement is the accu- 
rate expression of the manhood principle, which is 
the one idea this book is written to make clear. Mr. 
Rowntree is quite right in supposing that on the 
basis of this single principle the New Industrial 
America will be built. Nothing less fundamental 
is able to bring it to pass. 

The nature of the opportunity which America 
missed and must now recover by creating a demo- 
cratic industrial order, is picturesquely set forth in 
a little drama by Rauschenbusch, laid in the council 
chamber in heaven, when it was announced that Co- 
lumbus had discovered America. It is as follows: 

u ln one of the azure halls of heaven is the coun- 
cil chamber in which the Senate of the Immortals 
meets. Only the wisest of all ages have a seat there : 
Moses and Isaiah, Solon and Aristotle, King Arthur, 
Dante and their spiritual peers. Equipped with 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 259 

the experience of their own nations, enriched by 
communion with men of all times, unbiased by self- 
ish passions, uninfluenced by party interests, they 
sit to consider the course of human events. 

u To them entered one day that vivacious and 
versatile Personality who once came with the Sons 
of God and discussed the case of Job with Jehovah. 
He had again come 'from going to and fro in the 
earth, and from walking up and down in it,' and he 
now reported that Columbus had just discovered 
America. 

"Immediately there rose before the prophetic 
minds of the great Immortals the sight of broaden- 
ing streams of human life pouring from the old 
world into the new, of communities colonizing the 
seaboard, pushing up the river valleys, clustering 
around the waterfalls, dotting the plains with homes, 
and building up commonwealths and nations. A 
great hope swept audibly through the Senate like 
the rushing of a mighty wind. In that new conti- 
nent the best in humanity would find a free course ; 
no inherited tyrannies seeking to perpetuate them- 
selves, no embittering memories of bloody wars, no 
classes and castes cemented with injustice to baffle 
brotherhood and defy the liberty of States. Swiftly 
they began to plan a great Charter of Rights and 
Liberties that would forever bar out from the new 
land the forces, which had ruined the other peoples. 

"Satan listened with an amiable smile. 'Excuse 
me, gentlemen, but let us get down to common sense. 



260 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

We've got this all fixed. You forget that the people 
who occupy this country will need labor force. 
We'll let them use up the Indians, provided they 
can make 'em work. After that we'll tap the reserve 
force of Africa and put the black race at their serv- 
ice. You know that the venerable institution of 
slavery has been indispensable in the advancement 
of civilization. By restricting it to the colored races, 
we shall save the whites from the slight hardships 
which naturally accompany it.' (The Senate moved 
uneasily.) 'Then we've got to offer incentives to 
thrift and enterprise. We're going to introduce the 
system of private property in land which worked 
such remarkable results in the Roman Empire.' 
(A shudder ran through the assembly.) 'Those 
who first seize an opportunity can keep it and work 
it. That will promote industry and progress.' 

" 'But the land must not be sold in perpetuity,' 
broke in the venerable figure of Moses. 'Jehovah 
forbade it. All must have a share in God's land. 
What shall they do who come after?' 

" 'They'll have to make the best terms they can 
with the fellows on the inside. Every man for him- 
self, and I'm always ready to take the hindermost, 
you know,' and he winked at King Arthur, who 
gripped his staff with brawny fist, as if he would 
right willingly use it. 

" 'As the population increases, it will be neces- 
sary for the sake of efficiency to consolidate the 
resources of the nation. The ablest men will come 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 261 

to hold all the important property rights and the 
lines of traffic. In four hundred years, say about 
1<$92, they ought to have a pretty solid system. 
They can fix prices as they need them, and in that 
way they will have ample funds to finance the de- 
velopment of mankind and put society on a stable 
basis.' 

; 'Woe unto them that join house to house, that 
lay field to field,' exclaimed Isaiah, lifting his hands. 
'What mean ye, that ye crush my people and grind 
the face of the poor?' 

" 'This is death to the liberties of the people,' 
cried Aristotle. 'This is the very calamity from 
which every patriot of Greece sought to save his 
commonwealth. It was in vain. Greece became a 
desert.' Solon covered his face. 

"They sat in silence, and darkness seemed to 
shroud the chamber. One of the attendant angels 
was reminded of the gloom that settled over heaven, 
when word was brought of the fall of man. Even 
from the lips of Satan the smile vanished, and he 
passed out." 

Would not a new industrial America, built in 
accordance with her original purpose, mean a rever- 
sal of the standards, which, as this drama suggests, 
have been old and customary rules of conduct in 
industry? It would. But how could the reversal 
of these standards be affected without a revolution? 
It could not. But it would be a revolution of a new 
sort, a revolution by consent. America established 



262 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

the beginning of her experiment in political democ- 
racy by a revolutionary war, the use of physical 
force. The new industrial America likewise, can- 
not be established without a revolution, but it will 
use no physical force of any kind. It will be a 
mental revolution, a "reasonable" revolution. 

The industrial revolution with its application of 
steam to machinery, and capitalism to the organiza- 
tion of industry has been called "the revolution of 
the rich against the poor." It was natural enough 
that the poor should conduct a counter-revolution 
against the rich. For one hundred and fifty years 
each class has been operating a revolution of its 
own, and conducting an organized war against the 
other. If the structure of modern industry, over 
which they fight, is not to be destroyed, the time has 
come for a new kind of revolution in which both 
classes shall be allies, instead of rivals. Community 
labor boards will be the agencies and centers of the 
new revolution. It will start, indeed has already 
started, by the peaceful but powerful pressure of 
public opinion, compelling both antagonists to con- 
sider their conflict in the light of their mutual obli- 
gation to the community's interest instead of their 
own. The initiative in the revolution for the most 
part should be taken by capitalists on the principle 
of noblesse oblige, and for the further reason, stated 
by Lincoln in his first message to Congress: "Labor 
is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is 
only the fruit of labor and could never have existed 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 263 

if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior 
of capital and deserves much the higher considera- 
tion." 

To secure the consideration of industrial disputes 
in the light of their relation to the public welfare 
instantly transforms them into very different types 
of problems and opens the only clear road to their 
possible solution on a sound basis. But this is only 
a beginning. If the revolution is to produce per- 
manent results and issue in a new industrial America, 
it will have to be achieved by the free acceptance 
of a new transforming idea, which, so far as history 
has yet revealed, is the only force equal to the task. 
This transforming idea is the voluntary organiza- 
tion and operation of industry on the basis of a 
bill of duties instead of a bill of rights. This is a 
mental and spiritual process. But does not this take 
us into the field of ethics? Certainly. This is what 
the labor problem is about. It seems preposterous 
that we should permit a destructive industrial war 
to continue without making a serious attempt to 
discover exactly what its cause is. There is no hope 
of discovering its cause unless we see clearly that 
the question at issue is not mechanical, and not 
financial, but ethical. It lies in the defective ethical 
relationship between owners and workmen. It is 
quite understandable by any average high school 
boy. 

"There is," said Carlyle, "but one class of men 
to be trembled at, and that is the stupid class, the 



264 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

class that cannot see, who, alas, are they mainly 
that will not see." Let no one be deceived by the 
detailed complexities of modern business. These 
complexities are frequently used by a certain class 
of men as a smoke screen to obscure the central 
moral issue. Many of them may be honestly self- 
deceived, by absorption in details, as to what the 
real issue is. It is a commonplace for them to attack 
social philosophers with the remark, "You do not 
understand; modern industry is too complicated for 
you." Whereas the social philosopher is the only 
man who does understand it. With the so-called 
"practical" business men like the ex-German Kaiser, 
an understanding of modern industry glares by its 
absence, and this defect is tragic and costly for the 
rest of us. One of the greatest of social philoso- 
phers, M. Bergson, stated the heart of the problem 
when he said: 

"Many years hence, when the reaction of the 
past shall have left only the grand outlines in view, 
this, perhaps, is how a philosopher will speak of 
our age. He will say that the idea, peculiar to the 
nineteenth century, of employing science in the satis- 
faction of our material wants had given a wholly 
unforeseen extension to the mechanical arts, and 
equipped man, in less than fifty years, with more 
tools than he had made during the thousands of 
years he had lived upon earth. Each new machine 
being for man a new organ, an artificial organ, 
his body became suddenly and prodigiously increased 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 265 

in size, without his soul being at the same time able 
to dilate to the dimensions of his new body." 

The problem could not be other than an ethical 
one, because it mainly concerns humans. This is 
where the argument has led us by a straight course, 
and we ought to have the courage to follow wher- 
ever the argument leads us. You may make any 
legitimate use you please of the nation's forces in 
times of emergency to prevent public disaster. But 
law and guns only prevent and destroy. They are 
weakness and futility compared to an ethical motive, 
and they touch only the fringe of our problem. We 
are searching for some power, not to prevent men 
from doing wrong but to stimulate them to do right. 
There is nothing that will set a man going from 
within so that he will run himself, and do the 
right thing, except a living sense of duty. 

Workmen are organized for the express purpose 
of securing and defending their rights. Capitalists 
are organized for the express purpose of securing 
and defending their rights. It is a foregone conclu- 
sion that on due occasion they both will fight for 
their rights, and this is what in fact they do. When 
we are thus deliberately organized for industrial 
warfare, what else can we expect but warfare? 
There is no hope for its termination until the doc- 
trine of rights is replaced by the doctrine of duties 
as the first law of social conduct. The reason why 
Robinson Crusoe had no labor troubles after Friday 
came, was because his attitude towards him was 



266 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

determined by the theory of duties; the sense of 
responsibility for his personal development. 

This law is not intended to apply to one class 
alone, but to all classes alike. It is not offered to 
workingmen as a pious camouflage to divert their 
attention from their primary and inalienable rights, 
which have been so frequently denied them. It is 
this hypocrisy, which has brought the term "duty" 
into disrespect, and caused the theory of duties to 
be treated as the antithesis of the theory of rights, 
as if we under-rated the importance of rights and 
wanted to deny them. It is fitting and sometimes 
imperative that men should contend for their rights. 
It will continue to be necessary so long as society is 
organized on its present low levels. What we seek 
is to change the level in order to obviate the neces- 
sity of any contention for one's rights. We chal- 
lenge the basis of social organization, which is both 
a cause and consequence of the theory of rights. 
The theory of rights is a space-binding concept. 
The theory of duties is a time-binding concept, which 
alone has the power to transform the basis of society 
and lift life to a higher level, appropriate for men 
rather than animals. 

The doctrine of duty is here considered as a 
scientific social law. My contention is that to base 
our social conduct on the rights of man is a current 
political fallacy, that all rights are morally condi- 
tioned on duties fulfilled, that to make duty a corol- 
lary to primary duty, is unethical and has debased 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 267 

our social and business standards, that the primacy 
should be given to duties over rights, not that we 
should think less of rights, but more of duties. My 
contention also is that to give primacy to duties is 
the only effective way to secure one's rights, and 
that if this primacy is not only approved in principle, 
but observed in practice, as a rule of conduct for 
citizens, so that they will first of all seek the com- 
mon good and subordinate private to public interest, 
there can be no sure guarantee that their own inter- 
ests will be safeguarded. 

I realize that social philosophy has not yet coined 
a word to express this comprehensive idea. The 
absence of any word for it, and the misuse of the 
word u duty," make it necessary to describe the idea 
itself, and since the idea is the reversal of a common 
political fallacy, which for so long has been current 
and unquestioned, it is the more necessary that it 
be made as clear as may be. 

The doctrine of rights was the supreme formula 
of the French Revolution. The convention of 1787 
adopted a bill of rights. When a group of men 
petitioned it to adopt also a bill of duties, the con- 
vention voted it down, stating as the reason for its 
action that a bill of duties was a matter of religion. 
It was quite right in its judgment; quite wrong in 
its action. 

The doctrine of rights is an effective formula on 
which to conduct a fight against the tyranny of yes- 
terday; wholly ineffective as an aim for the construe- 



268 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

tive action of tomorrow. But ever since the epoch, 
begun with the American and French Revolutions, 
it has ruled us with sovereign sway. 

On the basis of rights we have won some liberty, 
but we have failed to inquire what we propose to 
do with it. Aimless liberty inevitably leads to an- 
archy and warfare. When men stand on their 
rights they will fight to secure and defend them; 
so will nations. Both within and among nations 
we are organized for warfare, because we are domi- 
nated by the formula of rights. 

All courts of law are courts of rights. Legisla- 
tive assemblies frequently have passed bills of rights. 
International conferences are wholly absorbed in 
the task of securing and protecting national rights. 
They have acted on this principle as between na- 
tions, because the citizens of these nations have 
acted on the same principle as among each other. 

The community movement seeks to change the 
basis of social organization and civilization by sub- 
stituting a bill of duties for a bill of rights. A 
community center, like the family, is an institute 
of duties, not an institute of rights. 

The most effective method of securing one's rights 
is to perform one's duties. My rights are what 
other men owe me; my duties are what I owe to 
them. If, then, we mutually discharge our duties, 
we automatically secure our rights. 

The only effective way to achieve disarmament 
between classes or nations is to operate on the doc- 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 269 

trine of duties. How can we expect any other kind 
of disarmament until we first disarm the mind? 
Is there any other way to disarm the mind except 
to substitute duties for rights? When I go to 
another man to render him a service I do not need 
to go accompanied by gunboats and rifles. They 
are automatically eliminated. 

Our inveterate inability to put ourselves by an 
act of intelligent sympathy in the other fellow's 
place, is due to the exclusive use of the principle of 
rights. Only when you put yourself in his place is 
it possible to do him justice and avoid conflict. As 
a mere matter of smartness the best way for one 
man to outwit another is to do him a service; it at 
once puts him on the defensive. The same is true 
of nations. 

This policy would lead a class or nation to learn 
from others; not impose its standards on them. It 
would disclose the surprising amount of ignorance 
every class and nation has accumulated about the 
others. It might in time even lead us to conclude 
with Mark Twain, that: "The older we grow the 
more we are astonished to notice how much ignor- 
ance one can contain without bursting one's clothes." 

The theory of rights is a secondary idea, a conse- 
quence of something else. No rights exist except as 
they are based on their corresponding duties. A 
right is the consequence of a duty fulfilled. It is not 
only that the conduct of nations and classes toward 
each other has been wrong. The disease is far 



270 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

deeper. Their ethical standards have been defec- 
tive. They have put rights in the first place; they 
belong in the second. 

This makes all the difference in the world. The 
persistence of armed conflict both within and among 
nations, is not a puzzle, but a natural product. The 
world has been running on a side track instead of 
the main track. In every program of international 
politics and of industrial politics a bill of duties 
glares by its absence. That's why they usually get 
nowhere except into trouble. 

The new epoch ushered in by the World War 
is morally bewildered and bankrupt for lack of a 
satisfying aim. The world is loosened from its old 
moorings and drifts without a rudder, a formative 
principle. It has not yet discovered a purpose road 
on which to travel. It's on its way but doesn't 
know where it is going. It has motion but no prog- 
ress. It lacks a formula to guide its thinking and 
direct its action. The formula it blindly seeks is 
the charter of duties. 

Will the world ever see the wisdom of substitut- 
ing its duties for its rights? No one can say. All 
one can say is that there is no other practical way 
of avoiding suicidal wreckage. The principle of 
duty plus the free acceptance of it, guarantees per- 
sonal joy and social progress. Liberty minus the 
principle of duty stimulates personal egotism and 
social anarchy. On the theory of rights the liberty 
of one will clash with the liberty of another in 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 271 

unending strife; heroism in behalf of the common 
good would be an absurdity; and progress would be 
blocked by liberty unregulated by a high purpose. 
But heroism in behalf of a cause bigger than one's 
own personal interests is the very thing the world 
now most admires. And what it admires it will 
one day grow to be like. 

When one realizes the ruin now wrought by the 
theory of rights and considers what would happen 
if it should become the permanent foundation of 
society, it seems to him unthinkable that men will 
continue to guarantee their own defeat, and he 
cries out with Mazzini: "No, certainly, it was not 
to attain the ignoble and immoral every one for him- 
self that so many great men, holy martyrs of 
thought, have shed, from epoch to epoch, the tears 
of the soul, the sweat and blood of the body." 

This principle, as I believe, is not only the only 
path to industrial peace, but is also destined to be 
the formula of the future in politics and religion, 
as well as in economics. Inasmuch as I believe that 
this principle is the transforming power in the evolu- 
tion of a new industrial America, I will emphasize 
it by quoting a bill of duties, which I prepared and 
presented to the Community Division of the Pan- 
Pacific Educational Congress, meeting recently at 
Honolulu, embracing the twenty-two nations and 
self-governing colonies bordering the Pacific, and 
which was adopted. I quote it to exhibit the prin- 
ciples which the theory of duties involves, and be- 



272 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

cause these principles apply to industrial politics 
exactly the same as to international politics. It is 
as follows: 

A Bill of Duties 

We, the members of the Community Conference of the 
Pan-Pacific Union, assembled at Honolulu, believing that all 
disputes among nations can be settled as easily and more 
effectively before instead of after armed conflict, but realiz- 
ing that the success of this process depends on operating it 
from the standpoint of duties instead of rights, and that only 
such a state of mind affords any hope of solving problems 
of international politics, hereby adopt the following bill of 
duties and pledge ourselves to work for its acceptance by the 
public opinion of our respective nations: 

1. We will think first of our duties to other nations 
before we consider the corresponding rights depending upon 
them. 

2. In all discussion of our relationship, both official and 
unofficial, we will put truth in the first place and not in the 
second place. 

3. We will endeavor to acquire the habit of differing in 
opinion without differing in feeling. 

4. We will have respect for our racial differences and 
accentuate the resemblances among us, as common human 
denominators. 

5. We will exercise mental hospitality toward the stand- 
ards of other nations rather than seek to impose our stand- 
ards upon them. 

6. We will aim to transform our commerce into a peace- 
maker by operating it as an exchange of mutual service 
rather than a system of exploitation. 

7. We will have a decent respect for the opinion of 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 273 

mankind rather than regard the self-centered opinions of 
our own nations. 

8. We will promote free trade in friendship, assisting 
each other by pooling our experience in science, commerce, 
and art. 

9. We will aim to promote the prosperity of other 
nations, recognizing the legitimate selfishness that the pros- 
perity of each depends on the prosperity of all. 

10. We will seek to make known the discovery that 
nations have like interests, to secure their recognition as 
common interests, and to compel the conclusion that all 
wars are therefore civil wars. 

It is highly suggestive and appropriate to borrow 
from the field of international politics a guiding 
principle to apply to our domestic industrial conflict. 
With clear insight Glenn Frank points out the or- 
ganic similarity of the problem in these fields of 
activity. He says : "The two fundamental problems 
of our time are the problem of international rela- 
tions and the problem of industrial relations. What 
is not widely enough recognized is that they are 
one problem, both damned by the same sins, both 
subject to the same solution. In both international 
and industrial relations we are faced with the break- 
down of the balance-of-power theory of government. 
In every instance it has ended in a disastrous con- 
flict. It has all along ministered to a sense of con- 
flicting interests where common interests should 
have been the basis of action. In industry we have 
had the old sickening cycle of competitive arma- 
ments, a sense of conflicting interests, a constant 



274 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

effort on the part of each industrial group to tip 
the balance in its favor, a sense of insecurity that 
has halted we know not how much enterprise, and 
the periodic industrial wars that we hide under the 
euphemism of a strike. Collective bargaining is a 
vast advance over the old unequal system of indi- 
vidual wage contracts, but it is only an expedient 
adopted on the way toward some intelligent organ- 
ization of industrial relations." 

In a recent magazine article, Walter B. Pitkin 
makes a pointed application of the truth of Mr. 
Frank's contention, which reveals still further the 
vital connection between these two problems. He 
says: 

"This brings us to the one obstacle to world 
peace which lies wholly within our own gates. We 
have most of the world's gold, most of the free 
capital, immense factories, and millions of skilled 
workers. The unbalance of trade has ruined our 
foreign trade with Europe; our exports and im- 
ports declined fifty per cent, in the first seven months 
of this year; Germany is selling textiles sixty per 
cent, cheaper than we can; German mills are under- 
bidding Pittsburgh in our domestic steel market; 
our automobile factories are running at fifty-seven 
per cent, capacity; and five million workers are idle, 
as winter comes on. Meanwhile, taxes refuse to 
shrink, and battleships are being built, while our 
farmers see their minute profits devoured by abnor- 
mal freight-rates and our builders touch only the 



NEW INDUSTRIAL AMERICA 275 

most urgent contracts. There is but one escape 
from the deadly combination of war-debts, an over- 
expanded factory system, and a money glut. New 
markets must be tapped quickly, new consumers 
found, new desires created. But where and how?" 

Then he proceeds to show why for obvious rea- 
sons this market cannot at present be found in 
Europe and not in South America, and can only 
be found in China and Siberia. But the American 
business man cannot invest millions in the Far East 
unless his own country protects him with as much 
force as necessary. The alternative, therefore, is 
either leave Asia to the Asiatics, or else run Asia 
and a huge fleet. Then Mr. Pitkin very pertinently 
remarks that this logic is impeccable granting the 
premise, that we must look abroad for new markets. 
This is the crucial statement in Mr. Pitkin's discus- 
sion. 

Why look abroad for new markets, handicapped 
by such conditions and dangers, when we could have 
an unlimited and unutilized market at home, if in- 
dustry were so organized as to make it available? 
The great words once addressed by Tennyson to 
the citizens of England convey a pointed present 
message to American business men : 

Call home your ships across the Biscayan tides, 
To blow the battle from their oaken sides, 

Why waste you yonder, 

Their idle thunder? 
Why stay they there to guard a foreign throne? 

Seamen, guard your own. 



276 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

Have we the industrial statesmanship to construct 
a new industrial America on a democratic basis, not 
only for our own sake, but for the sake of the world, 
as once we constructed a new political democracy, 
which has exerted an inspiring and transforming 
influence throughout the world? 



CHAPTER X 

SPORTSMANSHIP 

TS there any ground to justify the hope that a 
* new industrial America will be constructed on 
the manhood principle? Certainly. The warrant 
for this expectation, stated laconically, is the fact 
that God is not dead. In periods of democracy's 
apparent failure, its sincere friends should stake 
their hope on the unassailable position taken by 
James Russell Lowell in a similar circumstance, 
when he said: "I have great comfort in God. I 
think He is considerably amused sometimes, but on 
the whole loves us, and would not let us get at the 
match box if He did not know that the frame of 
the universe was fire-proof." He knew, as every- 
one ought to know, that the principles on which the 
world is built are fire-proof, that ultimately they 
are irresistible, that the stars in their courses are 
fighting in behalf of democracy. It is not possible 
to circumvent God, however much politicians may 
think they can do it. 

Mr. Baker closes his creative and wholesome 
book on "Industrial Unrest" with a statement con- 
taining the pregnant idea, the crucial importance of 
which for modern industry I am writing this entire 

277 



278 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

book to demonstrate. He says: "There is a solu- 
tion. It consists in the attitude, the spirit, which 
one maintains towards the labour problem an ad- 
venturous, inquiring, experimental attitude, ever 
hospitable toward new facts: and a generous and 
democratic spirit. I wonder if men can find this 
solution in its completeness without some high faith 
in God, and some vital interest in their fellowmen." 
No, Mr. Baker, they cannot. My conviction is 
that you are right. It is also my conviction that 
men will discover the solution in the way you sug- 
gest, because they will discover that every other road 
is a dead-end. Just as did Napoleon, who after 
Moscow exclaimed: "The Almighty is too strong 
for me." And just as did Heine, Germany's great- 
est satirist, who when lying on his "mattress-grave" 
in Paris cried out : "Alas, the irony of heaven weighs 
heavily upon me. The great Author of the universe, 
the Celestial Aristophanes, wished to show me, the 
petty, earthly, German Aristophanes, how my most 
trenchant satires are only clumsy patchwork com- 
pared with His, and how immeasurably He exceeds 
me in humor and colossal wit." The captains of 
industry will likewise discover that "God also is 
wise." Not that He is a satirist, but He seems to 
be determined that men shall not defeat themselves. 
They have freedom to choose wrong roads, but 
these roads are so hedged about with penalties for 
those who travel them, as to make the right road 
the only safe thoroughfare. Men may make this 



SPORTSMANSHIP 279 

discovery either through "high faith in God" or 
through the logic of facts. In either case the result 
is the same. They will yield obedience to the social 
law of duty, by discovering the penalties attached 
to its violation; by discovering that nothing else will 
work; that the only real freedom is the freedom to 
do right, even if they are not wise enough to make 
the discovery without paying so high a price for it 
as Heine and Napoleon did. 

You may say anything you please against the 
democratic manhood principle as an industrial pol- 
icy, except that any other policy has ever worked 
any better. If no other policy has ever worked 
better, the burden of proof is upon those, who 
refuse to accept this one. Let us frankly recognize 
that the democratic principle, either in government 
or industry, is difficult to operate, as all good things 
are, just because they are good. The measure of 
its merit is the degree of its difficulty. Fisher Ames 
said: "A monarchy is a merchantman which sails 
well but will sometimes strike a rock and go to the 
bottom, whilst a republic is a raft which will never 
sink, but then your feet are always in the water." 
Let us even grant that it may be hot water, what 
then? The objection finds its complete answer in 
the fact, that democracy's aim is not efficiency, but 
the self-development of individuals. It is their right 
to make mistakes, because only by the method of 
trial and error can self-development proceed. As 
a matter of fact, in industry, this method proves 



280 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

to be in the long run more efficient, but this is not 
its chief aim. Another student of democracy re- 
marked that the way to a throne usually lies through 
blood, that is, it used to when the king business was 
popular, but that the way to the presidency in a 
democracy lies through mud. Very well; mud is 
not as bad as blood. 

The question as to whether the manhood principle 
will be adopted as an industrial policy is not an open 
question, but a foregone conclusion. Anyone fam- 
iliar with history, with human nature and with God, 
never doubts it. It is not a question of whether; 
it is only a question of when. As to when, there 
are signs of hope for its realization in the not 
distant future. What furnishes this hope is the 
spirit of sportsmanship, which is a distinguishing 
characteristic of Anglo-Saxon men, and the chief 
guarantee of democracy's success, aside from the 
fact that God is a democrat and still lives. Oliver 
Wendell Holmes says that sportsmanship is "to 
brag little ; to show up well ; to crow gently when in 
luck; to own up, to pay up, to shut up when beaten. " 
Both the leaders of labor and the leaders of capital 
ought to own up that they are beaten, that the 
method of organized conflict, on which they are 
operating, is a failure, and that it should be replaced 
by the method of free and organized co-operation. 
They both now ought honestly to undertake the task 
of learning to ride the horse that threw them. The 
human tendency is to try out every wrong method 



SPORTSMANSHIP 281 

before the right one is accepted. By this time 
almost all the wrong methods have been tried and 
found wanting. If industrial leaders are true sports- 
men, they will freely acknowledge the fact as it 
is, and adopt the manhood principle, which has 
the promise of success. 

The statement that our hope for this solution 
of the labor problem rests on the fact that God 
is not dead, while accurate and sufficient, is no 
doubt too laconic and needs translation into particu- 
lars. Let me say, therefore, that my hope rests on 
three facts, namely: the spirit of nobility; the 
motive of self-interest; the increasing fear that 
the alternative is a social hell. I realize that the 
phrase "social hell" is a contradiction in terms, be- 
cause hell is not a social place to be in; it is anti- 
social. The word means "isolated." As applied 
to a place, it means the same as the word "idiot," 
applied to a person. The word "idiot" is the Greek 
word for "private," peculiar to one's self, unrelated 
to the interest of others. Hell is therefore inhab- 
ited only by "idiots"; a typical Hellite is an "idiot," 
that is, a non-cooperator. But I use this self-con- 
tradictory phrase to make pointed my meaning that 
the hell, here suggested, does not refer to one in 
some future world, but an industrial hell now. 

Past and present conditions make such an event 
neither inconceivable nor impossible. Military and 
industrial wars, together with the entailed suffering 
in spirit and body, make every man, who has the 



232 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

instincts of nobility, sometimes feel like an exile 
and alien in a planet like ours. He can well appre- 
ciate the sentiment expressed to Robinson Crusoe 
on his second voyage by a Russian Prince, exiled 
in Siberia, where Crusoe spent a winter on his 
return from China, through Russia to England. 
After hearing the account of Crusoe's island life, 
apart from so-called civilization, the Prince said 
that u the true greatness of life was to be masters 
of ourselves; that he would not have exchanged 
such a state of life as mine to be Czar of Muscovy; 
and that he found more felicity in the retirement he 
seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found 
in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of 
his master, the Czar; that he found the mind of 
man, if it was but once brought to reflect upon the 
state of universal life, and how little this world was 
concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly capable 
of making a felicity for itself; and though the 
greatness, the authority, the riches, and the pleas- 
ures which some enjoyed in the world, had much in 
them that was agreeable to us, yet all those things 
chiefly gratified the coarsest in our affections, such 
as our ambition, our particular pride, avarice, 
vanity, and sensuality; all which, being the mere 
product of the worst part of man, were in them- 
selves crimes, and had in them the seeds of all 
manner of crimes; but neither were related to, nor 
concerned with, any of those virtues that constituted 



us wise men." 



SPORTSMANSHIP 283 

The motive of fear among the three here sug- 
gested, I do not press as an argument, although it 
would be short-sighted to overlook a possible critical 
factor, such as this. During the critical days of 
1848 in France, the following solemn words were 
addressed by a conservative, Alexis de Tocqueville, 
to the Chamber of Deputies: 

"For the first time I feel a certain fear for the 
future, and what convinces me that I am right is 
that this is not simply a personal impression of 
mine; I think I may appeal to all who are here, and 
all will admit that a certain uneasiness, an indefin- 
able fear has taken possession of all spirits, that for 
the first time the feeling, the sense of instability, 
this warning sentiment of revolution, which some- 
times heralds them, and at others gives birth to 
them, that this feeling is both intense and wide- 
spread. Are you certain of the morrow? Do you 
know what will happen in a year, a month, a day? 
You do not know, but what you do know is that 
there is a storm on the horizon, that it is descending 
upon you will you allow it to overtake you? 

"Gentlemen, I beg you not to, I do not demand, I 
beseech you; I would willingly throw myself on my 
knees before you, so real and grave do I consider 
the danger, so convinced am I of this, that to 
mention it is not a mere flight of rhetoric. If the 
danger is great, provide against it while there is 
still time, correct the evils, change the present sys- 
tem, for this system is leading you to destruction." 



284 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

This warning was given on January 27, 1848. 
In four weeks Louis Phillippe was swept from the 
throne of France by the Revolution. No one can 
say how pertinent a warning like this may or may 
not be today in America. While the argument is 
perfectly legitimate, yet it is an appeal to fear, 
and an appeal to fear is always weak, and mostly 
futile. It is unworthy of American citizens to at- 
tempt to reconstruct our industry because they are 
actuated by the fear of what may happen if they do 
not. Hope, and not fear, is the true creative 
principle. 

The second element in our hope is the motive 
of self-interest. The appeal to intelligent self-in- 
terest is higher than an appeal to fear, and is also 
entirely legitimate. A very firm ground of our 
hope is that factory owners will discover that the 
new policy will pay. This is a powerful and ines- 
capable motive. The loss resulting from all other 
policies is the road, which will lead them to this 
discovery. Lincoln once stated picturesquely the 
teaching value of this process. "I cannot run the 
political machine; I have enough on my hands with- 
out that. It is the people's business the election 
is in their hands. If they turn their backs to the 
fire and get scorched in the rear, they'll find they 
have to sit on the blister." This is a big price to 
pay for information, but it is worth it. Our hope 
lies in the fact that both owners and workmen have 
been sitting for so long a time on self-inflicted 



SPORTSMANSHIP 285 

blisters, that they are now disposed to stop turning 
their backs to the fire and getting needlessly 
scorched. In the school of hard knocks they will 
be compelled to discover that they have like inter- 
ests, that these interests are common interests, and 
that in the civil war they are conducting neither 
side can win. No enterprise can escape serious 
loss to all involved in it, when it is conducted on the 
basis of a civil war. 

But neither the appeal to fear nor the appeal to 
self-interest is the real creative motive. It is the 
first of the three we suggested, the spirit of nobility. 
Not the struggle to avoid the evil, but the attempt 
to secure the good, has always been the key to 
social progress. The typical American citizen, and 
his number is not small, is a man with innate nobility. 
He understands America's original purpose; he puts 
the community's interest above his own; he has a 
genuine desire to lift artificial burdens from all 
shoulders and give every man a fair chance in the 
race of life; he understands that America's purpose 
cannot be fulfilled unless democracy is applied to 
industry; he frankly accepts Walt Whitman's true 
definition of democracy: "By God, I will have 
nothing that all other men may not have the counter- 
part of on like terms" : he perceives that the present 
basis of industry is morally wrong, and that it must 
be reconstructed; he is not an egotist, who boasts 
of his perfect Americanism and uses the boast to 
teach workingmen their place by the method of the 



286 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

club; nor is he a radical, who entertains any vain 
hope that the millennium can be inaugurated to- 
morrow; he is a balanced liberal-minded man of 
experience, who realizes that the industrial war, if 
continued, may mean ruin for his business and the 
failure of America and who is patiently trying to 
reconstruct industry on the manhood principle and 
searching for the best way of doing it. 

In the large number of this type of men among 
the captains of industry lies the hope of the peaceful 
reconstruction of industry on the manhood principle. 
In the face of the persistence of the sheep-nature 
among their fellows, these men are the bell-wethers 
to lead the way to a new industrial America. In 
his estimate of them, H. L. Gantt, a pioneer of the 
new America, was correct when he said: u We do 
not need a revolution, we do not need a class war. 
Most people will work for the common good if 
you give them a chance. The trouble is that we 
have been clinging to an autocratic system under 
the mistaken idea that it was good, at least for the 
aristocrat. The fact is, that it isn't. Democracy 
is far better for all of us. Industrial democracy 
will release our energies and make us the strongest 
people on earth." 

If any one protests that the hope for the volun- 
tary reconstruction of industry on this basis is not 
justified, the sufficient answer is that it has already 
begun to happen. The moral awakening of the 
wealthy is now in process. They are finding it a 



SPORTSMANSHIP 287 

thrilling adventure. The number of industrial 
plants, which have already begun to apply the man- 
hood principle is the most inspiring event in America 
since the war, but that is another story and lies 
outside of my present purpose. If you want the 
story, look around you. When one large employer 
says, as he did recently: "I do not care to make 
more money, I have all the money I want. I am 
interested in discovering what is right in industrial 
relations"; when another employer, who had begun 
to apply the manhood principle says : "It's the most 
interesting thing I ever did in my life. It beats 
mere money-making all hollow"; when the office of 
one of the leading capitalists of Wall Street has 
framed and hanging on its wall the following quo- 
tation from a speech by Mr. Asquith: "The old 
system has broken down. War was its final declar- 
ation of insolvency. New factors are at work. 
Science not only has not said her last words but is 
fairly to be described as still only lisping the alpha- 
bet of annihilation"; when Ida Tarbell, who is a 
careful observer, testifies that "The new kind of 
employer is seeing a significance and a possibility 
in humanizing his relations that he formerly did 
not dream. He is developing the inspiring con- 
sciousness that it is possible for him to be not a 
mere manufacturer of things for personal profit, 
but as well as maker of men and women for society's 
profit." In view of these facts is it not apparent 



288 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

that the dawn of the new day is standing tiptoe 
on the mountain top? 

To what extent these enlightened leaders will be 
able to make their influence effective in promoting 
a revolution by consent remains to be seen, but they 
are making a sincere effort, which deserves unstinted 
recognition and cordial support by all citizens of 
good-will. These leaders are stimulated by the 
memory that America once before, witnessed an 
industrial revolution, when the labor status of indus- 
trial slaves was changed by a fratricidal war in 
the 1860s. They desire to avoid the tragic blunder, 
made at that time by some of their fellow capital- 
ists, a blunder typified by the hard-headed, "prac- 
tical" man, David Christy, who six years before 
the Civil War, wrote a book called "Cotton is 
King." He had no use for any foolish sentiment, 
he said. He took the hard facts of life as he 
found them, and he went on to show that the inter- 
ests of the Southern cotton-growers demanded 
slavery if they were to prosper; and further, that 
the interests of the Northern manufacturers of cot- 
ton in the mills of Massachusetts and New York 
also demanded cheap cotton, which could be best 
produced by slave-labor in the South; and further, 
that the whole American people, wearing cotton 
clothing, most of them, every day in the year, de- 
manded this same system of production; and that 
therefore the whole agitation about the abolition 
of slavery was but the troubled dream of a few 



SPORTSMANSHIP 289 

silly enthusiasts. "Cotton is King," he said, "and 
it will finally determine the issue." 

"But hard-headed, practical man though he 
was," remarked Dr. Charles R. Brown, "he was 
utterly and eternally mistaken. Cotton was not 
king love was king! Love of country and love 
of freedom, love of humanity, and love of God 
love was king even in that hour when David Christy 
was writing out his claims about the kingship of 
cotton. And, indeed, before the ink was fairly 
dry upon the pages of his book, amid the rattle of 
musketry and the roar of cannon, in the quiet tones 
of Lincoln's inaugural address and in the prayers of 
millions of people, the fundamental lordship of love 
was being effectively asserted. Men and women 
did great deeds in those days; they made great 
sacrifices; they carried through great enterprises not 
because they were being paid for it in cotton they 
were not paid for it at all. They did it because 
they loved they loved their country, they loved 
liberty, they loved humanity, and they loved God 
more than any material advantage whatsoever. 
Love is king!" 

You may call it love, or God, or the manhood 
principle, or by whatever term you choose, but this 
is the creator of revolutions in behalf of the com- 
mon welfare. It will create the new industrial 
America, as once before it created America's in- 
dustrial revolution, which issued in her Civil War. 
The tragedy of the industrial revolution of 1860 



290 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

was that the love, which wrought it, had lightning 
in it. It is the sincere prayer of all true lovers 
of their country, and they have good reason for 
hope, that the new industrial America will be created 
by love without lightning; that it will be a revolu- 
tion by consent. 



AFTERWORD 

On the banks of the Potomac in the city where 
he was martyred, has recently been erected a fitting 
memorial to Abraham Lincoln. The simplicity of 
its Ionic columns, designed by Henry Bacon; the 
mural paintings on Unity, Fraternity and Charity 
by Jules Guerin; and above all the twenty foot 
statue, by Daniel Chester French, revealing Lin- 
coln, the lonely burden-bearer, but conscious of his 
strength to carry it, the terraces, trees and great 
reflecting pool, standing on the same axis with the 
Capitol Building and Washington Monument, and 
combining grandeur with beauty, all impressively 
symbolize the character of the man and make it one 
of the most notable monuments ever erected. It is 
isolated, distinguished and serene, as John Hay 
said it should be. 

During the progress of the work, covering a 
period of more than ten years, all concerned in it, 
members of the commission, architects, artists, stone 
cutters, laborers, showed a spirit of co-operation as 
if for a cause they loved. There were no strikes, 
no lockouts, no profiteering, no labor turn-over. 
The same workmen who were there at the begin- 
ning were there at the finish. Does any one need to 

291 



292 ROBINSON CRUSOE, SOCIAL ENGINEER 

ask why their work was a form of worship? Is the 
reason not obvious to all? 

Lincoln believed that what gave birth to the 
nation was the manhood principle, which he said 
meant to elevate the condition of men, to lift arti- 
ficial weights from all shoulders, to afford all an 
unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of 
life. During his speech at Independence Hall in 
1860, after expounding America's purpose, he made 
the prophetic remark that if the nation could not be 
maintained on this principle he would rather be 
assassinated on the spot. 

When industry is organized on this principle, and 
its leaders are as true to it as Lincoln was, industry 
will present no problem, but rather an opportunity 
for the association and self-development of citizens.
