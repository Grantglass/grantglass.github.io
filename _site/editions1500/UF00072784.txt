Robinson Crusoe.

WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of
fork, of a good family, though not of that
country, my father being a foreigner of Bro-
m, who settled firfl at Hull : he got a good
efiate by merchandise, and leaving 0!? his
trade, lived afterward at York; from whence
he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robin--
:on, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was
called Robina>> Kreatznaer ,- but by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called, nay we call ourselves, and
write our name Crusoe; and f0 my companions always called
me.

I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieutenant-colonel
to an English regiment of Foot in Flanders, formerly commanded
by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle
nar Dunkirk against the Spaniardr. What became of my second
brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother did
know what was become of me.

Beingthethirdson ofthe family, andnotbredtoanytrade,
"my head began to be' filled very early with rambling thoughts:

my father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent
share of learning, as far as house education, and a country free--
school generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I would
be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination
to this led me so strongly against the will, nay the commands of
my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my
mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something

fatal in that propension of nature tending directly to the life of
misery which was to befal me.

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex-
cellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined
by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this
subject: he asked me what reasons more than a mere, wandering
inclination I had for leaving my father's house and my native
country, where I might be well introduced, and had a pros-
pect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with
a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was for men of des-
perate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiringsuperior fortunes on
the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprize,
and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of
the common road; that these things were all either too far above
me, or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or
what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had
found by long experience was the best state in the world, the
most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and
hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of man-
kind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me, I might judge
of the happiness of this state, by this one thing, viz. That this
was the state of life which all other people envied; that Kings
have frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being born

to great things, and wish they had been placed in the middle ofor ROBINSON Causoz. 7

the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the
wise man gave his testimony to this, as the just standard of true
felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty or riches.

He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the cala-
mities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of
mankind; but that the middle station had the fewest disasters,
and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or
lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many
distempers and uneasinesses either of body or mind, as those were,
who by vicious living, luxury, and extravagancies on one hand,
or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient
diet on the other hand, bring distempers upon themselves by the
natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle sta-
tion of life was calculated for all kind of virtues and all kind of
enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle
fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society,
all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the bless-
ings attending the middle station of life; that this way men went
silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of
it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head,
not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the
body of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in easy circum-
stances sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the
sweets of living, without the bitter, feeling that they are happy,
and learning by every day's experience to know it more sensibly.

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate
manner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate myself
into miseries which nature and the station of life I was born in
seemed to have provided against; that I was under no necessity of
seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour
to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had beenjust8 Lin AND Anvsu'runes

recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy
in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder
it, and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus
discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he
knew would be to my hurt: in a word, that as he would do very
kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he di-
rected, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes,
as to give me any encouragement to go away: and to close all,
he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to'whom he
had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the low country wars, but could not prevail, his young de-
sires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed;
and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he
Would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step,
Goo would not bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be
none to assist in my recovery.

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so
himself; I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plen-
tifully, and especially when he spoke of my brother who was
killed; and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent,
and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke off the
discourse, and told me, his heart was so full, he could say no
more to me.

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as indeed who could
be otherwise; and I resolved not to think of going abroad any
more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. But
alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of
my father's further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved
to run quite away from him. However, I did not act so hastily
neither as my first heat of resolution prompted, but I took my
mother, at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than or>>or Ronmson Causes. 9

dinary, and told her, that my thoughts were so enu'rely bent upon
seeing the world, that I should never settle to any thing with
resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had bet-
ter give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I
was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice
to a trade, or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure, in did, I
should never serve out my time, and I should certainly run away
from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if
she would speak to my father to let me go but one voyage abroad,
if I me home again and did not like it, I would go no more,
and I would promise by a double diligence to recover that time
I had lost.

This put my mother into a great passion: she told me, she
knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any
such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to
give his consent to any thing so much for my hurt, and that she
wondered how I could think of any such thing after such a dis-
course as I had had with my father, and such kind and tender
expressionsassheknewmy fatherhad used tome; and thatin
short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I
might depend I should never have their consent to it; that for
her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction;
and I should never have it to say, that my mother was willing
'when my father was not.

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as
I have heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him, and
that my father, after shewing a great concern at it, said to her
with a sigh, "That boy might be happy if he would stay at
home, but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wrench
that was ever born; I an give no consent to it."

and mother about their being so positively determined against
what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one
day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any purpose of
making an elopement that time; but I say, being there, and one
of my companions being going by sea to London, in his father's
ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the common
allurement of seafaring men, viz. That it should cost me nothing
for my passage, I consulted neither father or mother any more,
not so much as sent them word of it: but leaving them to hear
of it as they might, without asking Goo's blessing, or my father's,
without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and
in an ill hour, Goo knows, on the first of September 1651, I
went on board a ship bound for London: never any young ad-
venturer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued
longer than mine. The ship was no sooner gotten out of the
Humber, but the wind began to blow, and the waves to rise in a
most frightful manner; and as I had never been at sea before, I
was most inexpressibly sick in body, and terrified in mind: I
began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how
justly I was overtaken by the judgement of Heaven for my wicked
leaving my father's house, and abandoning my duty; all the
good counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my mother's
entreaties came now fresh into my mind, and my conscience,
which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has
been since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the
breach of my duty to GOD and my father.

All this while the storm increased, and the sa, which I had
neVer been upon before, went very high, though nothing like
what I have seen many times since; no, nor like what I saw a
few days after: but it was enough to affect me then, who was but
a young sailor, and had never known any thing of the matter. I
expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every
'time the ship fell down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow'ofor Rosrusox Crwsoa. 1 r

the sea, we should never rise more; and in this agony of mind
I made many vows and resolutions, that if it would please Goo
here to spare my life this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot
upon dry land again I would go directly home to my father, and
never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take
his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any
more. NowI saw plainly the goodness of his observations about
the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had
lived all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea,
or troubles 'on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true
repenting prodigal, go home to my father.

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the

storm continued, and indeed some time after; but the next day
the wind was abated and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little
inured to it: however I was very grave for all that day, being
also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared
up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening fol-
lowed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next
morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the
sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most de-
lightful that ever I saw.

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick,
but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so
rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so
pleasant in so little time after. And now, lest my good resolu-
tions should continue, my companion who had indeed inticed me
away, comes to me, Well, Bob, says he, (clapping me upon the
shoulder,) how do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted,
won't you, last night, when it blew but a cap full of wind 2 A tap
full do you call it .? said I. It was a terrible storm. A norm,
you fool you, replies he, do you call that a storm 2 why it warm-
thing at all ; give a: but a good ship and tea-ram, and we think
nothing if such a squall of wind at that; but you're hat a fresh-
water :ailor, Bob: come, let u: make a howl quumh, and we'll
forget all that: do you In what charming weather it 1': now?
To make short this sad part of my story, we went the old way
of all sailors; the punch was made, and I was made drunk with
it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned all my repen-
tance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, and all my reso-
lutions for my future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its
smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of
that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears
and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being for--
gotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely
forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I
found indeed some intervals of reflection, and the serious thofights
did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes, but I shook
them OH", and roused myself from them as it were from a dis-
temper, and applying myself to drink and company, soon mas-
tered the return of those fits, for so I called them, and I had in
five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any
young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could de--
sire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and Provi-
dence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me
entirely without excuse. For if I would not take this for a deli--
verance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most
hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and
the mercy.

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth
Roads; the wind having been contrary, and the weather calm,
we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were
obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz. at south-west, for seven or eight days, dur-
ing which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into
the same roads, as the common harbour where the ships might
wait for a wind for the river.
We had not however rid here so long, but should have tided
it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and after we
had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However the roads
being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and
our ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and
not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest
and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day in
the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work
to strike our top-masts, and make every thing snug and close,
that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea
went very high indeed, and our ship rid fareeaetle in, shipped
several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come
home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor; so
that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables veered out
to the better end.

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I be-
gan to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen
themselves. The master, though vigilant in the business of pre-
serving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his eabin by me,
I could hear him softly to himself say several times, Lord, be
merciful to us, we shall be all last, we shall be all undone,- and
the like. During these first hurries, I was stupid, lying still in
my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my
temper: I could ill re-assume the first penitence which I had so
apparently trampled upon, and hardened myself against : I thought
the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be
nothing, like the first. But when the master himself eame by
me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was
dreadfully frighted; I got up out of my cabin, and looked out;
but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea went mountaim
high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes: when I
could look about, I could see nothing but distress round us: two
ships that rid near us,we found, had cut theirmastabythe14. LIFE AND Amen-runes

board, being deep loaden; and our men cried out, that a ship
which rid about a mile a--head of us was foundered. Two more
ships being driven from their anchors, were run out of the roads
to sea at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The
light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea;
but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running
away with only their spritsail out before the wind.

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master
of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was
very unwilling to do : but the boatswain protesting to him, that
if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented; and when
they had cut away the fore--mast, the main-mast stood so loose,
and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away
also, and make a clear deck.

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this,
who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright
before at but a little. But if I can express at this distance the
thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more
horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the
having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly
taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the
terror of the storm, put me into such a condition, that I an by
no words describe it. But the worst was not come yet: the
storm continued with such fury, that the seamen themselves
acknowledged they had never known a worse. We had a good
ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the sea, that the
seamen every now and then cried out, she would founder. It
was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they
meant by founder, till I enquired. However, the storm was so
violent, that I saw what is not often seen, the master, the boat-
swain, and some others more sensible than the mt, at their
prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to
the bottom. In the middle of thenight, and under. all the rest
of our dismisses, one of the men that had been down on purpose
to see, cried out, we had sprung a leak; another said there was
four foot water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the
pump. At that very word my heart, as I thought, died within
me, and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat,
into the oabin. However, the men roused me, and told me,
that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to
pump as another: at which I stirred up, and went to the pump
and worked very hmrtily. While this was doing, the master
seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm,
were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would not come
near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I who
knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought
the ship had broke, or some dreadful thing happened. In a
word, I was so surprised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this
was a time when every body had his own life to think of, nobody
minded me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped
up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie,
thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came
to myself.

We worked on, but the water increasing in the hold, it was
apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm
began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim
till we might run into a port, so the master continued firing guns
for help; and a light ship who had rid it out just a-head of us,
ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard
the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on
board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side; till at last, the
men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours,
our men cast them a rope over the stem with the buoy to it, and
then veered it out a great length, which they after great labour and
hazard took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stem
and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us
after we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own ship,
so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
shore as much as we could, and our master promised them, that
if the boat was staved upon shore he would make it good to their
master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away
to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as
W'interton-Neu.

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our
ship before we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first
time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea; I must
acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told
me she was sinking; for from that moment they rather put me
into the boat than that I might be said to go in: my heart was
as it were dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror
of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

While we were in this condition, the men yet labouring at the
oar to bring the boat near the shore, we could see (when our
boat mounting the waves we were able to see the shore) a great
many people running along the shore to assist us when we should
come near, but we made but slow way towards the shore, nor
were we able to reach the shore, till being past the light--house at
W'x'ntertan, the shore falls of? to the' westward towards Cram,
and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind: here
we got in, and, though not without much difficulty, got all safe
on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmauth, where, as
unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by
the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as
by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money
given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull, as
we thought fit.

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have
gone home, I had been happy, and my father, an emblem of our
blessed Saviour's parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me;
for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarn-outh
Road, it was a great while before he had any assurance that I was
not drowned.

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that
nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls
from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home,
yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to call this, not
will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on
to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be
before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Cer-
tainly nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery attend-
ing, and which it was impossible for me to escape, could have
pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions
of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instruc-
tions as I had met with in my first attempt.

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who
was the master's son, was now less forward than I ; the first time
he spoke to me after we were at Tarmouth, which was not till
two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several
quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone
was altered; and looking very melancholy, and shaking his had,
asked me how I did, and telling his father who I was, and how
I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go farther
abroad; his father turning to me with a very grave and concerned
tone, Young man, says he, you ought never to go to no any more;
you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not
to he a seafaring man. Why, Sir, said I, will you go to sea no
more? That is another care, said he, it is my calling, and therefore
my duty; hat a: you made thi: voyage for a trial, you .ree what a
taste Heaven ha: given you of what you are to expect if you pent}! ;
per/zap: this i: all hefallen u: on your account, like Jonah in the
:hip of Tarshish. Pray, continued he, what are you? and on
what account didyou go to no .? Upon that I told him some of
my story; at the end of which he burst out with a strange kind
of passion; What had I done, says he, that such an unhappy
wretch should come into my ship! I would not set my foot in
the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds. This in-
deed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet
agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could
have authority to go. However he afterwards talked very
gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my father and not
tempt Providence to my ruin; told me I might see a visible
hand of Heaven against me; find, young man, said he, depend
upon it ifyou do no! go back, wherever you go, you will meet with
not/ting but disaster: and disappointments, till your father': word:
are fulfilled upon you.

\Ve parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I
saw him no more; which way he went, I know not. As for me,
having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land;
and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with my-
self, what course of life I should take, and whether I should go
home, or go to sea.

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that
offered to my thoughts; and it immediately occurred to me how
I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should be
ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even every
body else; from whence I have since often observed, how incon--
gruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially
of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such
cases, 'viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed
to repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly
to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which
only can make them be esteemed wise men.

In this state of life however I remained some time, uncertain
what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An
irresistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed
a while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off;
and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to a
return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts
of it, and looked out for a voyage.

That evil influence which carried me first away from my
father's house, that hurried me into the wild and indigested
notion of raising my fortune; and that imprsst those conceits so
forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to
the entreaties and even the command of my father: I say, the
same influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate
of all enterprises to my view; and I went on board a vessel
bound to the coast of Africa; or, as our sailors vulgarly call it,
a voyage to Guinea.

It was my great misfortune that in all these adventures I did
not ship myself as a sailor; whereby though I might indeed have
worked a little harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had
learned the duty and office of a fore-mast man; and in time
might have qualified myself for a mate or lieutenant, if not for a
master. But as it was always my fate to choose for the worse,
so I did here; for having money in my pocket, and good clothes
upon my back, I would always go on board in the habit of a
gentleman; and so I neither had any business in the ship, or
learned to do any.

It was my lot firfl: of all to fall into pretty good company in Lon-
don, which does not always happen to such loose and unguided
young fellows as I then was ; the devil generally not omitting to lay
some snare for them very early: but it was not so with me. I
first fell acquainted with the master of a ship who had been on
the coast of Guinea,- and who having had very good success
there, was resolved to go again; and who taking a fancy to my
conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time,
hearing me say I had a mind to see the world, told me ifI
would go the voyage with him I should be at no expense; I
should be his messmate and his companion, and if I could carry
any thing with me, I should have all the advantage of it that
the trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet with some
encouragement.

I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict friendship with
this captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing man, I went
the voyage with him, and carried a small adventure with me,
which by the disinterested honesty of my friend, the Captain, I
increased very considerably; forI carried about 4.01. in such toys
and trifles as the Captain directed me to buy. This 401. I had
mustered together by the assistance of some of my relations
whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got my father,
or at least, my mother, to contribute so much as that to my first
adventure.

This was the only voyage which I may say was successful in
all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty
of my friend the Captain, under whom also I got a competent
knowledge of the mathematics, and the rules of navigation,
learned how to keep an account of the ship's course, take an ob-
servation, and, in short, to understand some things that were
needful to be understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight to
instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage
made me both a sailor and a merchant: forI brought home 5
pounds 9 ounces of gold dust for my adventure, which yielded
me in London at my return, almost 3001,. and this filled me with
those aspiring thoughts which have since so completed my ruin.

Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too; particu-
larly, that I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent
calenture by the excessive heat of the climate; our principal
trading being upon the coast, from the latitude of 15 degrees
north even to the line itself.

I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my friend, to my
great misfortune, dying soon after his arrival, I resolved to go
the same voyage again, and I embarked in the same vessel with
one who was his mate in the former voyage, and had now got
the command of the Iiip. This was the unhappiest voyage that
ever man made; for though I did not carry quite tool. of my
new gained wealth, so that I had 2001. left, and which I lodged
with my friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into
terrible misfortunes in this voyage; and the first was this, 'viz.
Our ship making her course towards the Canary Islands, or
rather between those islands and the African shore, was surprised
in the grey of the morning, by a Turkish rover of Sallee, who
gave chase to us with all the sail she could make. We crowded
also as much canvass as our yards would spread, or our masts
carry, to have got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us,
and would certainly come up with us in a few hours, we pre-
pared to fight; our ship having :2 guns, and the rogue 18.
About three in the afternoon he came up with us, and bringing
to, by mistake, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart our
stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our guns to bear on
that side, and poured in a broadside upon him, which made him
sheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring in also his
small shot from near 200 men which he had on board. How-
ever, we had not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He
prepared to attack us again, and we to defend ourselves; but
laying us on board the next time upon our other quarter, he
entered 60 men upon our decks, who immediately fell to cutting
and hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them with small
shot, half-pikes, powder-chests, and such like, and cleared our
deck of them twice. However, to cut short this melancholy
part of our story, our ship being disabled, and three of our men
killed, and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were
mrried all prisoners into Sallee, a port belonging to the Moors.
The usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I appre-
hended, nor was I carried up the country to the emperor's court,
as the rest of o'ur men were, but was kept by the captain of the
rover, as his proper prize, and made his slave, being young and
nimble, and fit for his business. At this surprising change of my
circumstances, from a merchant to a miserable slave, I was per-
fectly overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my father's
prophetic discourse to me, that I should be miserable, and have
none to relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought
to pass, thatI could not be worse; that now the hand of Heaven
had overtaken me, and I was undone without redemption. But
alas! this was but a taste of the misery I was to go through, as
will appear in the sequel of the story.

As my new patron or master had taken me home to his house,
so I was in hopes that he would take me with him when he went
to sea again, believing that it would some time or other be his
fate to be taken by a Spanish or Portugal man of war: and that
then I should be set at liberty. But this hope of mine was soon
taken away; for when he went to sea, he left me on shore to
look after his little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves
about his house; and when he came home again from his cruise,
he ordered me to lie in the cabin to look after the ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my escape; and what method
I might take to effect it; but found no way that had the least
probability in it: nothing presented to make the supposition of
it rational; for I had nobody to communicate it to, that would
embark with me; no fellow-slave, no Englishman, Irishman, or
Scotchman, there but myself; so that for two years, though I
often pleased myself with the imagination, yet I never had the
last encouraging prospect of putting it in practice.

After about two years an odd circumstance presented itself,
which put the old thought of making some attempt for my li-
berty again in my head: my patron lying at home longer than
usual, without fitting out his ship, which, as I heard, was for
want of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week, some-
times oftener, if the weather was fair, to take the ship's pinnace,
and go out into the road a fishing; and as he always took me
and a young Mama with him to row the boat, we made him
very merry, and I proved very dexterous in catching fish; inso-
much that sometimes he would send me with a Moor, one of his
kinsmen, and the youth, the Mareuo as they called him, to catch
a dish of fish for him.

It happened one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm
morning, a fog rose so thick, that though we were not half a
league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew
not whither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next
night, and when the morning came we found we had pulled off
to sea instead of pulling in for the shore; and that we were at
least two leagues from the shore: however we got well in again, '
though with a great deal of labour, and some danger; for the
wind began to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particularly
we were all very hungry.

But our_ patron, warned by this disaster, resolved to take more
care of himself for the future; and having lying by him the long
boat of our English ship he had taken, he resolved he would not
go a fishing any more without a compass and some provision;
so he ordered the carpenter of his ship, who also was an English
slave, to build a little state-room or cabin in the middle of the
long-boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand behind it to
steer and hale home the main-sheet; and room before for a hand
or two to stand and work the sails; she sailed with what we call
a shoulder of mutton sail; and the boom gibed over the top of
the eabin, which lay very snug and low, and had in it room for
him to lie, with a slave or two, and a table to eat on, with some
small lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he thought
fit to drink ; particularly his bread, rice, and coffee.

We went frequently out with this boat a fishing, and as I was
most dexterous to catch fish for him, he never went without me.
It happened that he had appointed to go out in this boat, either
for pleasure or for fish, with two or three .Moar: of some distinc-
tion in that place, and for whom he had provided extraordinarily;
and had therefore sent on board the boat over night a larger store
of provisions than ordinary; and had ordered me to get ready
three fusecs with powder and shot, which were on board his
ship; for that they designed some sport of fowling, as well as
fishing.

I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next
morning with the boat washed clean, her ancient and pendants
out, and every thing to accommodate his guests; when by and
by my patron came on board alone, and told me his guests had
put off going, upon some business that fell out, and ordered me
with the man and boy, as usual, to go out with the boat and
catch them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at his house;
and commanded that as soon as I got some fish I should bring it
home to his house; all which I prepared to do.

This moment my former notions of deliverance darted into my
thoughts, for now I found I was like to have a little ship at my
command; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnish
myself, not for a fishing business, but for a voyage; though I
knew not, neither did I so much as consider, whither I should
steer; for any where to get out of that place was my way.

My first contrivance was to make a pretence to speak to this
Moor, to get something for our subsistence on board; for I told
him we must not presume to eat of our patron's bread: he said,
that was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or biscuit
of their kind, and three jars with fresh water into the boat. I
knew where my patron's case of bottles stood, which it was evi--
dent by the make were taken out of some English prize; and I
conveyed them into the boat while the Moor was on shore, as if
they had been there before for our master; I conveyed also a
great lump of beeswax into the boat, which weighed above half
a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet, a
saw, and a hammer, all which were of great use to us afterwards;
especially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tried upon
him, which he innocently came into also; his name was Ismael,
who they call Mal}, or Mole}; so I called to him, Male}, said
I, our patron's guns are on board the boat, can you not get a
little powder and shot, it may be we may kill some Jimmie: (a
fowl like our curle'wr) for ourselves, for I know he keeps the
gunner's stores in the ship? Yes, my: 11:, I'll bring some; and
accordingly he brought a great leather pouch which held about a
pound and a half of powder, or rather more; and another with
shot, that had five or six pounds, with some bullets, and put all
into the boat: at the same time I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled one of the large
bottles in the case, which was almost empty; pouring what was
in it into another: and thus furnished with every thing needful,
we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle which is at the
entrance of the port knew who we were, and took no notice of
us; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we
hauled in our sail, and set us down to fish : the wind blew from
the N.N. E. which was contrary to my desire; for had it blown
southerly I had been sure to have made the coast of Spain, and
at least reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions were,
blow which way it would, I would be gone from that horrid
place where I was, and leave the rest to fate.

After we had fished some time and catched nothing, for when
I had fish on my hook I would not pull them up, that he might
not see them; I said to the Moor, this will not do, our master
will not be thus served, we must stand farther off: he thinking
no harm agreed, and being in the head of the boat set the sails;
and as I had the helm I run the boat out near a league farther,
and then brought her to as if I would fish, when giving the boy
the helm, I stept forward to where the Moor was, and making

a
as if I stooped for something behind him, I took him by sur-
prise with my arm under his twist, and tossed him clear over-

board into the sea. He rose immediately, for he swam like a
cork, and calling to me, begged to be taken in, told me he would
go all over the world with me; he swam so strong after the boat
that he Would have reached me very quickly, there being but
little wind; upon which I stept into the cabin, and fetching one
of the fowling pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I had
done him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him
none: but, said I, you swim well enough to reach to the shore, '
and the sea is calm, make the best of your way to shore, and I
will do you no harm, but if you come near the boat I'll shoot
you through the head; for I am resolved to have my liberty:
so he turned himself about and swam for the shore, and I make
no doubt but he reached it with ease, for he was an excellent
swimmer.

I could have been content to have taken this Moar with me,
and have drowned the boy, but there was no venturing to trust
him. VVheu he was gone I turned to the boy, who they called
Kurt, and said to him, ij', if you will be faithful to me I'll
make you a great man, but if you will not stroke your face to
be true to me, that is, swear by Mahomet and Iii: fat/m": beard,
I must throw you into the sea too: the boy smiled in my face,
and spoke so innocently that I could not mistrust him; and
swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the world with me. '

"'hile I was in View of the Moor that was swimming, I stood
out directly to sea with the boat, rather stretching to windward,
that they might think me gone towards the Strait: mouth (as
indeed any one that had been in their wits must have been sup-
posed to do), for who would have supposed we were sailed on to
the southward to the truly Barbarian coast, where whole nations
of negroes were sure to surround us with their canoes, and de--
stroy us; where we could never once go on shore but we should
be devoured by savage basis, or more merciless savages of
human kind.

But as soon as it grew dusk in the evening, I changed my
course, and steered directly south and by east, bending my course
a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the shore; and
having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth quiet sea, I made
i such sail that I believe by the next day at three o'clock in the
' afternoon, when I first made the land, I could not be less than
,. I 50 miles south of Sallee; quite beyond the emperor of Mop-area's
dominions, or indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we saw
no people.

1 Yet such was the fright I had taken at the Moors, and the
~ dreadful apprehensions I had of falling into their hands, that I
would not stop, or go on shore, or come to an anchor. The
wind continuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five days,
and then the wind shifting to the southward, I concluded also
' that if any of our vessels were in chase of me, they also would
now give over; so I ventured to make to the coast, and came to
* an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew not what, or
' where; neither what latitude, what country, what nation, or what
river: I neither saw, or desired to see any people, the principal
thing I wanted was fresh water. We came into this creek in the
evening, resolving to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country; but as soon as it was quite dark, we heard
such dreadful noises of the barking, roaring, and howling of wild
creatures of we knew not what kinds, that the poor boy was
ready to die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore till
day. Well, Xur}, said I, then I won't, but it may be we may
see men by day, who will be as bad to us as those lions. Then
we give the>>: the shoot gun, says Xury, laughing; make them not
won Such English Xury spoke by conversing among us slaves.
However I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave him
a dram (out of our patron's case of bottles) to cheer him up:
after all Xury': advice was good, and I took it; we dropped our
little anchor and lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none;
for in two or three hours we saw vast great creatures (we knew
not what to call them) of many sorts, come down to the sea-
shore and run into the water, wallowing and washing themselves
for the pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made such
hideous howlings and yellings, that I never indeed heard the
like. ~
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but
we were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty
creatures come swimming towards our boat: we could not see
him, but we might hear him by his blowing to be a monstrous
huge and. furious beast. Xury said it was a lion, and it might
be so for aught I know; but poor Xurj cried to me to weigh
the anchor and row away. No, says I, Xury, we can slip our
cable with a buoy to it and go of? to sea, they cannot follow us
far. I had no sooner said so, but I perceived the creature (what-
ever it was) within two oars length, which something surprised
me; however I immediately stept to the cabin-door, and taking
up my gun fired at him, upon which he immediately turned
about, and swam towards the shore again.

But it is impossible to describe the horrible noises, and hide--
ous cries and howlings, that were raised, as well upon the edge
of the shore, as higher within the country, upon the noise or
report of the gun; a thing I have some reason to believe those
creatures had never heard before: this convinced me that there
was no going on shore for us in the night upon that coast, and
how to venture on shore in the day was another question too;
for to have fallen into the hands of any of the savages, had been
as bad as to have fallen into the hands of lions and tigers; at
least we were equally apprehensive of the danger of it.

Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on shore some-
where or other for water, for we had not a pint left in the boat;
when or where to get to it was the point. X107 said, if I would
let him go on shore with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any water, and bring some to me. I asked him why he
would go? why I should not go, and he stay in the boat? The
boy answered with so much affection that made me love him ever
after. Says he, If wild man: came, the} eat me, you go wq.
Well, Xury, said I, we will both go, and if the wild mans come,
we will kill them, they shall eat neither of us; so I gave Xury
a piece of task-bread to eat, and a dram out of our patron's case
of bottles which I mentioned before ; and we hauled the boat in
as near the shore as we thought was proper, and waded on shore;
carrying nothing but our arms, and two jars for water.

I did not care to go out of sight of the boat, fearing the
coming of canoes with ravage: down the river: but the boy
seeing a low place about a mile up the country rambled to it;
and by and by I saw him come running towards me. I thought
he .was pursued by some savage, or frighted with some wild
beast, and I ran forward towards him to help him, but when I
came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his shoulders,
which was a creature that he had shot, like a hare, but different in
colour, and longer legs; however we were very glad of it, and it
was very good meat; but the great joy that poor X107 came
with, was to tell me he had found good water, and seen no wild
mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take such pains for
water; for a little higher up the creek where we were, we found
the water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little
wayup; so we filled ourjars and feasted on the hare we had
killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen no foot-steps
of any human creature in that part of the country.

As I had been one voyage to this coast before, I knew very
'well that the islands of the Canaries, and the Cap: d: Verd
islandsalso,laynotfarofi'fromthecoast. Butaslhad
no instruments to take an observation to know what latitude we
were in, and did not exactly know, or'at least remember, what
latitude they were in, I knew not where to look for them, or

when to stand off to sea towards them; otherwise I might now
easily have found some of these islands. But my hope was, that
if I stood along this coast till I came to that part where the
English traded, I should find some of their vessels upon their
usual design of trade, that would relieve and take us in.

By the best of my calculation, that place where I now was,
must be that country, which lying between the emperor of
Morocta': dominions and the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited,
except by wild beasts, the Negroes having abandoned it, and
gone farther south for fear of the Moan; and the Moor: not
thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason of its barrenness; and
indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of
tigers, lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour
there; so that the Mean use it for their hunting only, where
they go like an army, two or three thousand men at a time; and
indeed for near an hundred miles together upon this coast, we
saw nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day; and heard
nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by night.

Once or twice in the day-time I thought I saw the Pica of
Temrifle, being the high top of the mountain Tenerif? in the
Canaries; and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of
reaching thither; but having tried twice, I was forced in again by
contrary winds, the sea also going too high for my little vessel,
so I resolved to pursue my first design and keep along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water after we
had left this place; and once in particular, being early in the
morning, we came to an anchor under a little point of land which
was pretty high, and the tide beginning to flow, we laystill to
go farther in. X107, whose eyes were more about him than it
seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me that we had
best go farther of the shore; for, says he, look yonder lies a
dreadful monster on the side of that hillock fast asleep. I looked
where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was
a terrible great lion that lay on the side of the shore, under the
shade of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him.
X10), says I, you shall go on shore and kill him : Xury looked
frighted, and said, Me kill ! he eat me at one mouth,- one
mouthful he meant. However, I said no more to the boy, but
bade him lie still; and took our biggest gun, which was almost
musquet--bore, and loaded it with a good charge of powder, and
with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun with
two bullets; and the third, for we had three pieces, I loaded
with five smaller bullets. I took the best aim I could with the
first piece, to have shot him into the head, but he lay so with
his leg raised a little above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg
about the knee, and broke the bone. He started up growling
at first, but finding his leg broke fell down again, and then got
up upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar that ever I
heard. I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on the
head; however, I took up the second piece immediately, and
though he began to move of, fired again, and shot him into the
head, and had the pleasure to see him drop, and make but little
noise, but lay struggling for life. Then X10) took heart, and
would have me let him go on shore. Well, go, said I. So the
boy jumped into the water, and taking a little gun in one hand,
swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to the
creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him
into the head again, which dispatched him quite.

Thiswas game indeed to us,but thiswas no food: andI was
very sorry to lose three charges of powder and shot upon a crea-
ture that was good for nothing to us. However, X1177 said he
would have some of him; so he comes on board, and asked me

togivehimthe hatchet. Forwhat, X197? saidI.. Meatqf
111': head, said he. However, Xury could not cut off his head,
but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a

monstrous great one.

I bethought myself however, that perhaps the skin of him
might one way or other be of some value to us; and I resolved
to take off his skin, if I could. So X10) and I went to work
with him; but Xury was much the better workman at it, for I
knew very ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole
day; but at last we got off the hide of him, and spreading it on
the top of our cabin, the sun efi'ectually dried it in two days time,
and it afterwards served me to lie upon.

After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for
ten or twelve days, living very sparing on our provisions, which
began to abate very much, and going no oftener into the shore
than we were obliged to for fresh water: my design in this was,
to make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to say, any where
about the Cape de Verd, where I was in hopes to meet with some
European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what course I had
to take, but to seek for the Blonds, or perish there among the
Negroer. I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed
either to the coast of Guinea or to Bras-1'1, or to the East India,
made this Cape, or those Blonds; and, in a word, I put the
whole of my fortune upon this single point, either that I must
meet with some ship, or must perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as
l have said, I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in
two or three places, as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon
the shore to look at us; we could also perceive they were quite
black, and stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone on
shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and said to
me, No go, no go: however I hauled in nearer the shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me
a good way.. I observed they had no weapons in their hands,
except one, who had a long slender stick, which X10) said was
a lance, and that they would throw them a great way with good
aim. So I kept at a distance, but talked with them by signs as
well as I could; and particularly made signs for something to
eat: they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would fetch
me some meat; upon this I lowered the top of my sail, and lay
by, and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than
half an hour came back, and brought with them two pieces of
dry flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their country;
but we neither knew what the one nor the other was: however,
we were willing to accept it, but how to come at it was our next
dispute, for I was not for venturing on shore to them, and they
were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all,
for they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and
stood a great way oil" till we fetched it on board, and then came
close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make
them amends; but an opportunity offered that very instant to
oblige them wonderfully; for while we were lying by the shore,
came two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as we took
it) with great fury, from the mountains towards the sea: whe-
ther it was the male pursuing the female, or whether they were
in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the lat-
ter; beeause, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom
appear but in the night; and in the second place, we found the
people terribly frighted, especially the women. The man that
had the lance or dart did not fly from them, but the rest did;
however, as the two creatures ran directly into the water, they
did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plunged
themselves into the sea, and swam about as ifthey had come for
their diversion. At last one of them began to come nearer our
boat than at first I'expected, butllay ready for him, for-I had,

3 234. Lira AND onau'ruazs

loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade X107 load
both the others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I
fired, and shot him directly into the head. Immediately he sunk
down into the water, but rose instantly, and plunged up and
down as if he was struggling for life; and so indeed he was: he
immediately made to the shore, but between the wound, which
was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he died just
before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor
creatures at the noise and the fire of my gun; some of them
were even ready to die for fear, and fell down as dead with the
very terror. But when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in
the water, and that I made signs to them to come to the shore,
they took heart and came to the shore, and began to search for
the creature. I found him by his blood staining the water; and
by the help of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the
Negroer to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that it
was a most curious leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable
degree, and the Negroes held up their hands with flmiration to
think what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the
noise of the gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the
mountains from whence they came, nor could I at that distance
know what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eating
the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to have them take it
as a favour from me, which when I made signs to them that they
might take him, they were very thankful for. Immediately they
fell to work with him, and though they had no knife, yet with a
sharpened piece of wood they took of his skin as readily, and
much more readily, than we could have done with a knife: they
offered me some of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I
would give it them, but made signs for the skin, which they
gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more of their
provision, which though I did not understand, yet I accepted;
then I made signs to them for some water, and held out one of
my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to shew that it was
empty, and that I wanted to have it filled. They called imme-
diately to some of their friends, and there came two women, and
brought a great vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in
the sun; this they set down fi)!' me, as before, and I sent Xury
on shore with my jars, and filled them all three. The women
were as stark naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and com, such as it was, and
water: and, leaving my friendly Negroes, I made forward for
about eleven days more, without offering to go near the shore,
till I saw the land run out a great length into the sea, at about
the distance of four or five leagues before me; and, the sea being
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point: at length,
doubling the point at about two leagues from the land, I saw
plainly land on the other side to seaward; then I concluded, as
it was most certain indwd, that this was the Cape de Verd, and
those the islands, ealled from thence Capede Verd Islands. How-
ever, they were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what
Ihadbesttodo, forifIshouldbetakenwithafi'eshofwindl
might neither reach one nor the other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stept into the cabin
and set me down, X10) having the helm, when on a sudden the
boy cried out, blaster, master, a ship with a sail ! and the
foolish boy was frighted out of his wits, thinking it must needs
be some of his master's ships sent to pursue us, when I knew we
were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jumped out of the
eabin, and immediately saw not only the ship, but what she was,
Quiz.) that it was a Portuguese ship, and, as I thought, was bound
to the coast of Guinea for Negroes. But when I oberved the
course she steered, I was soon convinced they were bound some
other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the shore;
upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I could, resolving
to speak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able
to come in their way, but that they would be gone by before I
could make any signal to them. But after I had crowded to the
utmost, and began to despair; they, it seems, saw me by the
help of their perspective-glasses, and that it was some European
boat, which, as they supposed, must belong to some ship that
was lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up. I was en--
couraged with this, and as I had my patron's ancient on board,
I made a waft of it to them for a signal of distress, and fired a
gun, both which they saw ; for they told me they saw the smoke,
though they did not hear the gun. Upon these signals they very
kindly brought-to, and lay-by for me, and in about three hours
time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish,
and in French; but I understood none of them; but at last a
Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered
him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bade
me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my
goods. A

It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one would believe,
that I was thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a misera-
ble and almost hopeless condition as I was in, and immediately
offered all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for my
deliverance ; but he generously told me, he would take nothing
from me, but that all I had should be delivered safe to me when

I came to the Brasils; for, says he, I have saved your life on no
other terms than I would he glad to he saved myself; and it may
one time or other he my lot to he taken up in the same condition:
Besides, said he, when I carry you to the Brasils, so great a way
from your own country, if I should take from you what you have,
you will he starved there, and then I only take away that life I
have given. No, no, Seignior Inglese, says he, Mr. Englishman,
I will carry you thither in charity, and those thing: will help you to
buy your :uhrirtence there, andyour partage home again.

As he was charitable in his proposal, so he was just in the
performance to a tittle, for he ordered the seamen, that none
should offer to touch any thing I had; then he took every thing
into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of
them, that I might have them; even so much as my three
earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he saw, and
told me he would buy it of me for the ship's use, and asked me
what I would have for it? I told him, he had been so generous
to me in every thing, that I could not offer to make any price
of the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which he told me he
would give me a note of his hand to pay me 80 pieces of eight
for it at Brasil; and when it came there, if any one offered to
give more, he would make it up; he ofi'ered me also 60 pieces
of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not
that I was not willing to let the captain have him, but I was very
loth to sell the poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me so faith-
fully in procuring my own. However, when I let him know
my reason, he owned it to be just, and offered me this medium,
that he would give the boy an obligation to set him free in ten
years, if he turned Christian. Upon this, and. Xur} saying he
was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brasil:, and arrived in the
Ba} de Todo: lo: Santos, or All-Saintr--Bay, in about twenty-two
days after. And now I was once more delivered from the most
miserable of all conditions of life, and what to do next with my-
self I was now to consider. '

The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can never;
enough remember; he would take nothing of me for my passage,
gave me twenty ducats for the leopard's skin, and forty for the
lion's skin, which I had in my boat, and caused every thing I
had in the ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to sell he bought, such as the case of bottles, two of my
guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax, for I had made can-
dles of the rest; in a word, I made about 220 pieces of eight of
all my cargo, and with this stock I went on shore in the Bruils.

I had not been long here, but being recommendedtothe house
of a good honest man like himself, who had an Ingenio as they
call it; that is, a plantation and a sugar house, I lived with him
some time, and acquainted myself by that means with the man-
ner of their planting and making of sugar; and seeing how well
the planters lived, and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved,
if I could get license to settle there, I would turn planter among
them, resolving in the mean time to find out some way to get
my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me. To
this purpose, getting a kind of a letter of naturalization, I pur--
chased as much land that was uncured as my money would reach,
and formed a plan for my plantation and settlement, and such a
one as might be suitable to the stock which I proposed to my-
self to receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguue of Lirbon, but born of Eng-
lish parents, whose name was Wells, and in much such circum-
stances as I was. I call him neighbour, because his plantation
lay next to mine, and we went on very sociably together. My
stock was but low, as well as his; and we rather planted for
(bod, than any thing else, for about two years. However, we
began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so
that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of
us a large piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year
to come; but we both wanted help; and now I found, more
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my boy Xury.

But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did right, was no
great wonder: I had no remedy but to go on; I was gotten into
an employment quite remote to my genius, and directly contrary
to the life I delighted in, and for which I forsook my father's
house, and broke through all his good advice; nay, I was com-
ing into the very middle station, or upper degree of low life,
which my father advised me to before; and which if I resolved
to go on with, I might as well have staid at home, and never
have fatigued myself in the world as I had done: and I used
often to say to myself, I could have done this as well in England
among my friends, as have gone five thousand miles off to do it,
among strangers and savages in a wilderness, and at such dis-
tance as never to hear from any part of the world that had the
least knowledge of me.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the
utmost regret. I had nobody to converse with, but now and
then this neighbour: no work to be done, but by the labour of
my hands; and I used to say, I lived just like a man east away
upon some desolate island, that had nobody there but himself.
But how just has it been, and how should all men reflect, that,
when they compare their present conditions with others that are
worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be
convinced of their former felicity, by their experience; I say
how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in
an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had so often
unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in which,
had I continued, I had in all probability been exceeding prospeb
tons and rich.

I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on
the plantation, before my kind friend the captain of the ship,
that took .me up at sea, went back; for the ship remained there,
in providing his loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three
months; when telling him what little stockI had left behind me in
Dildo", he gave me this friendly and sincere advice: Seigmr Inglut,
says lie, (for so he always called me) if you will give me letters,
and a procuration here in form to me, with orders to the person
who has your money in London, to send your effects to Lisbon,
to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are proper
for this country, I will bring you the produce of them, God
willing, at my return; but since human affairs are all subject to
changes and disasters, I would have you give orders but for one
hundred pounds sterling, which you say is half your stock, and
let the hazard be run for the first; so that if it come safe, you
may order the rest the same way; and if it miscarry, you may
have the other half to have recourse to for your supply.

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I
could not but be convinced it was the best course I could take;
so I accordingly prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom
I had left my money, and a procuration to the Portuguese cap-
tain, as he desired. .

I wrote the English captain's widow a full account of all my
adventures, my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the
Portugal captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what
condition I was now in, with all other necessary directions for
my supply; and when this honest captain came to Lisbon, he
found means, by some of the English merchants there, to send
over, not the order only, but a full account of my story, to a
merchant at London, who represented it effectually to her; where-
upon, she not only delivered the money, but out of her own
pocket sent the Porlugal captain a very handsome present for
his humanity and charity to me.

The merchant in London vesting this hundred pounds in
English goods, such as the captain had written for, sent them
directly to him at Lisbon, and he brought them all safe to me to
the Brasils ; among which, without my direction, (for Iwas too
young in my business to think of them) he had taken me to
have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils necessary for my
plantation, and which were of great use to me.
When this eargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I
was surprised with joy of it; and my good steward the eaptain
had laid out the five pounds which my friend had sent him for a
present for himself, to purchase, and bring me over a servant
under bond for six years service, and would not accept of any
consideration, except a little tobacco, which I would have him
accept, being of my own produce.

Neither was this all; but my goods being all English manu-
factures, such as cloth, stuffs, baize, and things particularly
valuable and desirable in the country, I found means to sell them
to a very great advantage, so that I may say I had more than
four times the value of my first cargo, and was now infinitely
beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the advancement of my
plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave,
and an European servant also; I mean another besides that which
the captain brought me from Lido>>.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means
of our greatest adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next
year with great success in my plantation; I raised fifty great rolls
of tobacco on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for
necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty rolls, being
each of above an hundred weight, were well cured and laid by
against the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now, increasing
in business and in wealth, my head began to be full of projects
and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are indeed often
the ruin of the best heads in business.

Had I continued in the station I was now in, I had room for
all the happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my
father so earnestly recommended a quiet retired life, and of
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to
be full; but other things attended me, and I was still to be the
wilful agent of all my own miseries; and particularly to increase
my fault, and double the reflections upon myself, which in .my
future sorrows I should have leisure to make. All these mis--
carriages were procured by my apparent obstinate adhering to
my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and pursuing that
inclination in contradiction to the clearest views of doing myself
good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects and those
measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to pre-
sent me with, and to make my duty.

As I had done thus in breaking away from my parents, so I
could not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy
View I had of being a rich and thriving man in my new planta-
tion, only to pursue a rash and immoderate desire of rising faster
than the nature of the thing admitted; and thus I cast myself
down again into the deepest gulph of human misery that ever
man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life and a state
of health in the world.

To come then by the just degrees to the particulars of this
part of my story; you may suppose, that having now lived
almost four years in the Brasile, and beginning to thrive and
prosper very well upon my plantation, I had not only learned
the language, but had contracted acquaintance and friendship
among my fellow planters, as well as among the merchants at St.
Salvadore, which was our port; and that in my discourses among
them, I had frequently given them an account of my two
voyages to the coast of Guinea, the manner of trading with the
Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast,
for trifles, such as beads, toys, knives, scissars, hatchets, bits of
glass, and the like, not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants
teeth, 55:. but Negroes for the service of the Brasilx, in great
numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on
these heads, but especially to that part which related to the buy--
ing Negroes, which was a trade at that time not only not far entered
into, but as far as it was, had been carried on by the Assientos,
or permission of the kings of Spain and Portugal, and engrossed
in the public, so that few Negroes were bought, and those exces-
sive dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and
planters of my acquaintance, and talking of those things very
earnestly, three of them came to me the next morning, and told
me they had been musing very much upon what I had discoursed
with them of the last night, and they came to make a secret pro-
posal to me; and after enjoining me secrecy, they told me that they
had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea ; that they had all
plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much
as servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on,
because they could not publicly sell the Negroes when they came
home; so they desired to make but one voyage, to bring the
Negroes on shore privately, and divide them among their own
plantations; and in a word, the question was, whether I would
go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the trading part upon
the coast of Guinea; and they ofi'ered me that I should have my
equal share of the Negroes, without providing any part of the
stock. '
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been
made to any one that had not had a settlement and plantation of
his own to look after, which was in a fair way of coming to be
very considerable, and with a good stock upon it. But for me,
that was thus entered and established, and had nothing to do but
go on as I had begun, for three or four years more, and to have
sent for the other hundred pounds from England, and who in that
time, and with that little addition, could scarce have failed of
being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling, and that in-
creasing too; for me to think of such a voyage, was the most
preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could be
guilty of.

But I, that was ham to be my own destroyer, could no more
resist the offer, than I could restrain my first rambling designs,
when my father's good counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I
told them I would go with all my heart, if they would undertake
to look after my plantation in my absence, and would dispose of
it to such as I should direct if I miscarried. This they all
engaged to do, and entered into writings or covenants to do so;
and I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation and effects,
in case of my death, making the captain of the ship that had
saved my life as before, my universal heir, but obliging him to
dispose of my effects as I had directed in my will, one half of
the produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped to
England.

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my efl'ecm,
and keep up my plantation; had I used half as much prudence
to have looked into my own interest, and have made ajudgment
of what I ought to have done, and not to have done, I had cer-
tainly never gone away so from prosperous an undertaking,
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circumstance, and
gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common hazards;
to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular misfor-
tunes to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my
fancy rather than my reason: and accordingly the ship being
fitted out, and the cargo furnished, and all things done as by
agreement by my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour, the Ist of September, being the same day eight years
that I went from my father and mother at Hull, in order to act
the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my own interest.

Our ship was about no ton burthen, carried 6 guns, and 14.
men, besides the master, his boy, and myself; we had on board
no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our
trade with the Negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and odd
trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissars, hatchcts,
and the like.
The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to
the northward upon our own coast, with design to stretch over
for the African coast when they came about 10 or 12 degrees of
northern latitude, which it seems was the manner of their course
in those days. We had very good weather, only excessive hot,
all the way upon our own coast, till we came the height of Cape

St. Augustine; from whence keeping Farther of at sea, we lost
sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fer-

nand d: Norm/m, holding our course N. E. by N. and leaving
those isles on the east. In this course we passed the line in
about twelve days time, and were by our last observation in 7
degrees 22 min. northern latitude, when a violent tornado or
hurricane took us quite out of our knowledge: it began from
the south--east, same about to the north-west, and then settled
into the north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible man-
ner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing but
drive; and scudding away before it, let it carry us whither ever
fate and the fury of the winds directed ; and during these twelve
days, I need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed
up, nor indeed did any in the ship expect to save their lives.

In this distress, we had, besides the terror of the storm, one
of our men died of the calenture, and one 'man and the boy
washed overboard. About the twelfth day, the weather abau'ng
a little, the master made an observation as well as he could, and
found that he was in about 1 1 degrees north latitude, but that he
m as degrees of longitude difference west from Cape St. Augm-- -
tine; so that he found he was gotten upon the coast of Guinea, or
the north part of Brasil, beyond the river Amazon", toward that
of the river Oronoque, commonly called the Great River, and
began to consult with me what course he should take, for the
ship was leaky and very much disabled, and he was going directly
back to the coast of Brasil.

I was positively against that; and looking over the charts of
the sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was'no
inhabited country for us to have recourse to, till we came within
the circle of the Caribbee-irlandt, and therefore resolved to stand
away for Barbadrm, which by keeping of at sea, to avoid the
indraught of the bay or gulph of Maxim, we might easily per-
form, as we hoped, in about fifteen days sail ; whereas we could
not possibly make our voyage to the coast of Africa without some
assistance, both to our ship and to ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away
JV. W. by IV. in order to reach some of our Eng/I'M islands,
where I hoped for relief; but our voyage was otherwise deter-
mined; for being in the latitude of 12 deg. 18. min. a second
storm came upon us, which carried us away with the same im--
petuosity westward, and drove us so out of the very way of all
human commerce, that had all our lives been saved, as to the
sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than
ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our
men early in the morning cried out, Land .' and we had no sooner
run out of the cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts
in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a

moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in
such a manner, that we expected we should all have perished im-
mediately; and we were immediately driven into our close quar-
ters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea.

It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like con-
dition, to describe or conceive the consternation of men in such
circumstances: we knew nothing where we were, or upon what
land it was we were driven, whether an island or the main,
whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the rage of the wind
was still great, though rather less than at first, we could not so
much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes without
breaking in pieces, unless the winds by a kind of miracle should
turn immediately about. In a word, we sat looking one upon
another, and expecting death every moment, and every man
acting accordingly as preparing for another world, for there was
little or nothing more for us to do in this: that which was our
prwentcomfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that contrary to
our expectation the ship did not break yet, and that the master
said the wind began to abate.

Now though we found that the wind did a little abate, yet the
ship having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for
us to expect her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition in-
deed, and had nothing to do but to think of saving our lives as
well as we could. We had a boat at our stern, just before the
storm, but she was first staved by dashing against the ship's rud--
der, and in the next place she broke away, and either sunk or
was driven off to sea, so there was no hope from her; we had
another boat on board, but how to get her 06" into the sea was
a doubtful thing: however, there was no room to debate, for
we fancied the ship would break in pieces every minute, and
some told us she was actually broken already.

In this distress, the mate of our vessel lays hold of the boat,
and with the help of the rest of the men, they got her slung over
the ship's side, and getting all into her, let go, and committed
ourselves, being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild
sea; for though the storm was abated considerably, yet the sea
went dreadful high upon the shore, and might well be called, den
wild zee, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw
plainly, that the sea went so high, that the boat could not live,
and that we should be inevitably drowned. As to making sail,
we had none, -nor, if we had, could we have done any thing with
it; so we worked at the oar towards the land, though with heavy
harm, like men going to execution: for we all knew, that when
the boat came nearer the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea. However, we committed our
souls to God in the most earnest manner, and the wind driving
us towards the shore, we hastened our destruction with our own
hands, pulling as well as we could towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or
shoal, we knew not; the only hope that could rationally give us
the least shadow of expectation, was, if we might happen into
some bay or gulph, or the mouth of some river, where by great
chance we might have run our boat in, or got under the lee of
the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was no-
thing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
shore, the land looked more frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven about a league and a
half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came
rolling a--stem of us, and plainly bade us expect the confide-grace.
In a word, it took us with such a fury, that it overset the boat
at once; and separating us, as well from the boat as from one
another, gave us not time hardly to say, 0 God! for we were
all swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt
when I sunk into the water; for though I swam very well, yet
I could not deliver myself from the waves so as to draw breath,
till that wave having driven me, or rather carried me 'a vast way
on towards the shore, and having spent itself, went back, and
left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with the water
I took in. I had so much presence of mind as well as breath
left, that seeing myself nearer the main land than I expected, I
got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land
as fast as I could, before another wave should return and take
me up again. But I soon found it was impossible to avoid it;
for I saw the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and as
furious as an enemy which I had no means or strength to con-
tend with; my business was to hold my breath, and raise myself
upon the water, if I could: and so by swimming to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible: my
greatest concern now being that the sea, as it would carry me a
great way towards the shore when it came on, might not carry
me back again with it when it gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or
30 feet deep in its own body; and I could feel myself carried
with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore, a very
great way; but I held my breath, and assisted myself to swim
still forward with all my might. I was ready to burst with
holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to my
immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above
the surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of
time that I could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave
me breath and new courage. I was covered again with water a
good while, but not so long but I held it out; and finding the
water had spent itself, and began to return, I struck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground again with my
feet. I stood still a few moments to recover breath, and till the
water went from me, and then took to my heels, and ran with
what strength I had farther towards the shore. But neither
would this deliver me from the fury of the sea, which came
pouring in after me again, and twice more I was lifted up by the
waves and carried forwards as before, the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well nw been fatal to me';
for the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or
rather dashed me against a piece of a rock, and that with such
force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the
breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it not returned
again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water; but
I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I

should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast
c
by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till
the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at
first, being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and
then fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore,
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swal-
low me up as to carry me away; and the next run I took I got
to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I clnmbered up
the clifts of the'shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from
danger, and quite out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed, and safe on shore, and began to look up
and thank God that my life was saved in a case wherein there
was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. I believe it
is impossible to express to the life what the ecstasies and trans-
ports of the soul are, when it is so saved, as I may say, out of
the very grave; and I do not wonder now at that custom, viz.
that when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is
tied up, andjust going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought
to him: I say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with
it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him of it, that
the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart, and

overwhelm him:
For sudden joy, like grief}, confound at first.

I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my
whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in the contemplation of my
deliverance, making a 'thousand gestures and motions which I
cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comrades that were
drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved but myself;
for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of
them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not 'feIlows. '

I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when the breach and
froth of the sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far
off, and considered, Lord! how was it possible I could-get on
shore!

After] had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my
condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place
I was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon found my
comforts abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deliverance:
for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing either to
at or drink tocomfort me; neither did I see any prospect before
me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts: and that which was particularly afilicting to me,
was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature
for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature
that might desire to kill me for theirs: in a word, I had nothing
about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a
box; this was III'my provision, and this threw me into terrible
agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a mad-man;
night coming upon me, I began with a heavy heart to consider
what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that
country, seeing at night they always come abroad for their
prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time, was,
to get up into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which
grew near me, and where I resolved to sit all night, and consider
the next day what death I should die, for as yet I saw no pros-
pect of life. I walked about a furlong from the shore, to see if
I could find any fresh water to drink, which I did, to my great
joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco in my mouth to
prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it, en-
deavoured to place myself so, as that if I should sleep I might
not fall; and having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon,
for my defence, I took up my lodging, and having been ex-
cessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably
as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and found
rm self the most refreshed with it that I think I ever was on such
an occasion.

\Vhen I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the
storm abated, so that the sea did not rage and s" ell as before:
but that which surprised me most, was, that the ship was lifted

off in the night from the sand where she lay, by the swelling of
the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock which I first
mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the dashing me
against it; this being within about a mile from the shore where [
was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself
on board, that, at least, I might save some necessary things for
my use.

"'hen I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked
about me again, and the first thing I found was the boat, which
lay as the wind and the sea had tossed her, up upon the land,
about two miles on my right hand; I walked as far as I could
upon the shore to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of
water between me and the boat, which was about half a mile
broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my
present subsistence.

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide
ebbed so far out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of
the ship; and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I
saw evidently, that if we had kept on board, we had been all safe,
that is to say, we had all got safe on shore, and I had not been so
miserable as to be left entirely destitute of all comfort and com-
pany, as I now was: this forced tears from my eyes again, but as
there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to get to the
ship; so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to
extremity, and took the water; but when I came to the ship, my
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on board, for as
she lay a-ground, and high out of the water, there was nothing
within my reach to lay hold of. I swam round her twice, and
the second time I spied a small piece of a rope, which I wondered
[did not see at first, hang down by the fore--chains so lowas that
with great diflicultyl got hold of it, and by the help of that rope
got up into the forecastle of the ship: here I found that the ship
was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold, but that
she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth,
that her stem lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low
almost to the water; by this means all her quarter was free, and
all that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first
work was to search and to see what was spoiled and what was
free; and first I found that all the ship's provisions were dry,
and untouched by the water; and being very well disposed to
eat, I went to the bread-room and filled my pockets with biscuit,
and eat it as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose.
I also fbund some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a
large dram, and which I had indeed need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat to
furnish myself with many things which I foresaw would be very
necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had,
and this extremity roused my application. We had several
spare yards, and two or three large spars of wood, and a spare
top-mast or two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many of them overboard as I could manage
for their weight, tying every one with a rope that they might not
drive away; when this was done I went down the ship's side, and
pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast together at both
ends, as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or
three short pieces of plank upon them cross-ways, I found I
could walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to bear
any great weight, the pieces being too light; so I went to work,
and with theearpenter's saw I cut a spare toprmast into three
lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour
and pains: but hope of furnishing myself with necessaries, en-
couraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to have
done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight;
my next care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what
I laid upon it from the surf of the sea; but I was not long con-
sidering this; I first laid all the planks or boards upon it that I
could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I first
got three of the seamen's chests, which I had broken open and
emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the first of these
I filled with provisions, 'viz. bread, rice, three Dun/z cheeses,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much upon, and
a little remainder of European corn which had been laid by for
some fowls which we brought to seawith us, but the fowls were
killed; there had been some barley and wheat together, but, to
my great disappointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten or spoiled it all; as for liquors, I found several cases of
bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were some cordial
waters, and in all about five or six gallons of rack; these I
stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into the
chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing this, I found
the tide began to flow, though very calm; and I had the morti-
fication to see my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on
shore upon the sand, swim away; as for my breeches, which
were only linen, and open--kneed, I swam on board in them and
my stockings : however, this put me upon rummaging for clothes,
of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for
present use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon;
as, first, tools to work with on shore; and it was after long
searching that I found out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed
a very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a ship--
loading of gold would have been at that time: I got it down in
my raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into
it, for I knew in general what it contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms: there were
two very good fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols;
these I secured first, with some powder-homs, and a small bag of
shot, and two old rusty swords: I knew there were three barrels
'of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed
them; but with much search I found them, two of them dry
and good, the third had taken water: those two I got to my
raft, with the arms; and now I thought myself pretty well
freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with
them, having neither sail, oar, or rudder, and the least cap-fun
of wind would have overset all my navigation.

I had three encouragements: I. A smooth, calm sea: 2. The
tide rising and setting into the shore: 3. What little wind there
was, blew me towards the land: and thus, having found two or
three broken oars belonging to the boat, and besides the tools
which were in the chest, I found two saws, an axe and a ham-
mer, and with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or there-
abouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the place where I had landed before, by which I
perceived that there was some indraft of the water, and conse-
quently I hoped to find some creek or river there, which I might
make use of as a port to get to land with my cargo.

AsI imagined, so it was; there appeared before me a little
opening of the land, andl found a strong current of the tide set
into it, so I guided my raft as well as I could to keep in the
middle of the stream: but here I had like to have suffered a
second shipwreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft run
a-ground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being a-ground
at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my wgo had
slipped off towards that end that was afloat, and so fallen into
the water. I did my utmost, by setting my back against the
chests, to keep them in their places, but could not thrust of? the
raft with all my strength, neither durst I stir from the posture I
was in; but holding up the chests with all my might, stood in
that manner near half an hour, in which time the rising of the
water brought me a little more upon a level; and a little after,
the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust her ofl'
with the car] had, into the channel; and then driving up higher,
I at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land
on both sides, and a strong current or tide running up: I looked
on both sides for a proper place to get to shore, for I was not
willing to be driven too high up the river, hoping in time to see
some ship at sea, and therefore resolved to place myself as near
the coast as I could.

At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek,
to which, with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and
at last got so near, as that, reaching ground with my oar, I
could thrust her directly in; but here I had like to have dipped
all my cargo in the sea again ; for that shore lying pretty steep,
that is to say sloping, there was no place to land, but where one
end of the float, if it run on shore, would lie so high, and the
other sink lower as before, that it would endanger my cargo
again: all that I could do, was to wait till the tide was at the
highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor to hold the
side of it fast to the shore, near a flat piece of ground, which I
expected the water would flow over; and so it did. As soon as
I found water enough (for my raft drew about a foot of water),
I thrust her on upon that flat piece of ground, and there fastened
or moored her by sticking my two broken cars into the ground;
one on one side near one end; and one on the other side nw.
the other end; and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left
my raft and all my cargo safe on shore.

My next work was to view the country, and seek a proper
place for my habitation, and where to stow my goods, to secure
them from whatever might happen; where I was I yet knew
not; whether on the continent or on an island, whether inhabited
or not inhabited, whether in danger of wild beasts or not; there
was a hill not above a mile from me, which rose up very steep
and high, and which seemed to over-top some other hills which
lay as in a ridge from it northward; I took out one of the fowl-
ing pieces, and one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and
thus armed I travelled for discovery up to the top of that hill,
where, after I had with great labour and difficulty got to the top,
I saw my fate to my great affliction, 'viz. that I was in an island
environed every way with the sea, no land to be seen, except
some rocks which lay a great way off, and two small islands less
than this, which lay about three leagues to the west.

I found also that the island I was in was barren, and, as I saw
good reason to believe, uninhabited, except by wild beasts, of
whom however I saw none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but
knew not their kinds, neither when I killed them could I tell
what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming back, I
shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting upon a tree on the side of
a great wood; I believe it was the first gun that had been fired ,
there since the creation of the world. I had no sooner fired, but
from all the parts of the wood there arose an innumerable num-
ber of fowls of many sorts, making a confused screaming, and
crying every one according to his usual note; but not one of
them of any kind that I knew: as for the creature I killed, I
took it to be a kind of hawk, its colour and beak resembling it,
but had no talons or claws more than common; its flesh was
wrion, and fit for nothing.

Contented with this discovery, I came back to my raft, and
fell to work to bring my cargo on shore, which took me up the
rest of that day; and what to do with myself at night I knew
not, nor indwd where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down on

c 2
the ground, not knowing but some wild beast might devour me,
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no need for those
fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricadoed myself round with
the chests and boards that I had brought on shore, and made a
kind of a hut for that night's lodging: as for food, I yet saw
not which way to supply myself, except that I had seen two or
three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood where I shot the
fowl.

I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many
things out of the ship, which would be useful to me, and par-
ticularly some of the rigging and sails, and such other things as
might come to land, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel, if possible; and as I knew that the first storm
that blew must necessarily break her all in pieces, I resolved to
set all other things apart, till I got every thing out of the ship
that I could get: then I called a council, that is to say, in my
thoughts, whether I should take back the raft; but this appeared
impracticable ; so I resolved to go as before, when the tide was
down, and I did so, only that I stripped before I went from my
hut, having nothing on but a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen
trowsers, and a pair of pumps on my feet.

I got on board the ship, as before, and prepared a second raft;
and having had experience of the first, I neither made this so
unwieldy, nor loaded it so hard; but yet I brought away several
things very useful to me; as first, in the carpenter's stores, I
found two or three bags full of nails and spikes, a great screw-
jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and above all, that most useful
thing called a grindstone: all these I secured, together with
several things belonging to the gunner, particularly two or three
iron crows, and two barrels of musquet--bullets, seven musquels,
and another fowling--piece, with some small quantity of powder
more; a large bag full of small shot, and a great roll of sheet
lead; but this last was so heavy I could not hoist it up to get it
over the ship's side.

Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes that I could
find, and a spare fore-top--sail, hammock, and some bedding;
and with this I loaded my second raft, and brought them all safe
on shore, to my very great comfort.

I was under some apprehensions during my absence from the
land, that at least my provisions might be devoured on shore;
but when I came back, I found no sign of any visitor, only
there sat a creature like a wild cat upon one of the chests, which,
when I came towards it, ran away a little distance, and then
stood still: she sat very composed, and unconcerned, and looked
full in my face, as if she had a mind to be acquainted with me;
I presented my gun at her, but as she did not understand it, she
was perfectly unconcerned at it, nor did she offer to stir away:
upon which I tossed her a bit of biscuit, though by the way I
was not very free of it, for my store was not great : however, I
spared her a bit, I say, and she went to it, smelled it, ate it, and
looked, as plused, for more: but I thanked her, and could spare
no more; so she marched of.

Having got my second cargo on shore, though I was fain to
open the barrels of powder, and bring them by parcels, (for they
were too heavy, being large casks,) I went to work to make me
a little tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for that
purpose; and into this tent I brought every thing that I knew
would spoil, either with rain or sun, and I piled all the empty
chests and casks up in a circle round the tent, to fortify it from
any sudden attempt, either from man or beast.

When I had done this I blocked up the door of the tent with
some boards within, and an empty chest set up an--end without :
and spreading one of the beds upon the ground, laying my two
pistols just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went to
bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all night, for I wasf.
large raft, I loaded it with all those heavy goods, and came away:
but my good luck began now to leave me; for this raft was so
unwieldy and so overladen, that after I had entered the little
cove, where I had landed the rest of my goods, not being able
to guide it so handily as I did the other, it overset, and threw
me and all my cargo into the water. As for myself it was no
great harm, for I was near the shore; but as to my cargo, it was
great part of it lost, especially the iron, which I expected would
have been of great use to me: however, when the tide was out,
I got most of the pieces of cable ashore; and some of the iron,
though with infinite labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the
water, a work which fatigued me very much. After this, I went
every day on board, and brought away what I could get.

I had been now 13 days on shore, and had been I 1 times on
board the ship, in which time I had brought away all that one
pair of hands could well be supposed capable to bring; though I
believe verily, had the calm weather held, I should have brought
away the whole ship, piece by piece; but preparing the 12th
time to go on board, I found the wind begin to rise; however
at low water I went on board, and though I thought I had rum-
maged the cabin so efl'ectually, as that nothing more could be
found, yet I discovered a locker with drawers in it, in one of
which I found two or three razors, and one pair of large scissars,
with some ten or a dozen of good knives and forks; in another
I found about thirty-six pounds value in money, some European
coin, some Brasil, some pieces of eight, some gold, some silver.

I smiled to myself at the sight of this money. 0 Drug! said
I, aloud, what art thou good for? thou art not worth to me, no
not the taking of of the ground: one of those knives is worth
all this heap: I have no manner of use for thee, even remain
where thou art and go to the bottom, as a creature whose life is
not worth saving. However, upon second thoughts, I took it
away, and wrapping all this in a. piece of canvass, I began to
think of making another raft; but while I was preparing this, 1'
found the sky over-cast, and the wind began to rise, and in a
quarter of an hour it blew a fresh gale from the shore. It pre-
sently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pretend to make a
raft with the wind off shore, and that it was my business to be
gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be
able to reach the shore at all: accordingly I let myself down into
the water, and swam across the channel, which lay between the
ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly
with the weight of things I had about me, and partly the rough-
ness of the water; for the wind rose very hastily, and before it
was quite high water it blew a storm.

But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I lay with all
my wealth about me very secure. It blew very hard all that
night; and in the morning when I looked out, behold no more
ship was to be seen: I was a little surprised, but recovered my-
self with this satisfactory reflection, viz. That I had lost no time,
nor abated any diligence to get every thing out of her that could
be useful to me ; and that indeed there was little left in her that
I was able to bring away, if I had had more time.

I now gave over any more thoughts of the ship, or of any
thing out of her, except what might drive on shore from her
wreck, as indeed divers pieces of her afterwards did; but those
things were of small use to me.

My thoughts were now wholly employed about securing my-
self against either savages (if any should appear) or wild beasts,
if any were in the island; and I had many thoughts of the
method how to do this, and what kind of dwelling to make;
whether I should make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon
the earth: and, in short, I resolved upon both, of the manner and
description of which it may not be improper to give an account.

I soon found the place I was in was not for my settlement,
particularly because it was upon a low moorish ground near the
sea, and I believed would not be wholesome, and more particu-
larly because there was no freshwater near it; so I resolved to
find a more healthy and more convenient spot of ground.

I consulted several things in my situation which I found would
be proper for me: rst, Health, and fresh water, I just now
mentioned. 2dly, Shelter from the heat of the sun. 3dly, Secu-
rity from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast. athly, A
view to the sea; that if God sent any ship in sight, I might not
lose any advantage for my deliverance, of which I was not wil-
ling to banish all my expectation yet.

In search of a place proper for this, I found a little plain on
the side of a rising hill, whose front towards this little plain was
steep as a house-side, so that nothing could come down upon me
from the top; on the side of this rock there was a hollow place,
worn a little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave: but
there was not really any cave or way into the rock at all.

On the flat of the green, just before this hollow place, I
resolved to pitch my tent: this plain was not above an hundred
yards broad, and about twice as long, and lay like a green before
my door, and at the end of it descended irregularly every way
down into the low grounds by the sea--side. It was on the
N. N. IV. side of the hill, so that I was sheltered from the heat
every day, till it came to a W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts,
which in those countries is near the setting.

Before I set up my tent, I drew a half circle before the hollow
place, which took in about ten yards in its semi-diameter from
the rock, and twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning
and ending.

In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong stakes, driving
them into the ground till they stood very firm, like piles, the
biggest end being out of the ground about five foot and a half,

and sharpened on the top; the two rows did not stand above six
inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in the ship,
and laid them in rows one upon another, within the circle between
these two rows of stakes, up to the top, placing other stakes in
the inside, leaning against them, about two foot and a half high,
like a spur to a post; and this fence was so strong, that neither
man or beast could get into it or over it: this cost me a great
deal of time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the woods,
bring them to the place, and-drive them into the earth.

The entrance into this place I made to be not by a door, but
by a short ladder to go over the top; which ladder, when I was
in, I lifted over after me; and so I was completely fenced in,
and fortified, as I thought, from all the world, and consequently
slept secure in the night, which otherwise I could not have done;
though, as it appeared afterward, there was no need of all this
caution from the enemies that I apprehended danger from.

Into this fence or fortress, with infinite labour, I carried all
my riches, all my provisions, ammunition and stores, of which
you have the account above; and I made me a large tent, which,
to preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent there, I made double, viz. one smaller tent within,
and one larger tent above it, and covered the uppermost with a
large tarpaulin which I had saved among the sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the bed which I had
brought on shore, but in a hammock, which was indeed a very
good one, and belonged to the mate of the ship.

Into this tent I brought all my provisions, and every thing
that would spoil by the wet; and having thus enclosed all my
goods, I made up the entrance, which till now I had left open,
and so passed and repassed, as I said, by a short ladder.

When I had done this, I began to work my way into the rock ;
and bringing all the earth and stones that I dug down, out
through my tent, I laid them up within my fence in the. nature
of a terrace, that so it raised the ground. within about a foot and
a half: and thus I made me a cave just behind my tent, which
served me like a cellar to my house.

It cost me much labour, and many days, before all these
things were brought to perfection, and therefore I must go back
to some other things which took up some of my thoughts. At
the same time it happened, after I had laid my scheme for the
setting up my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain
falling from a thick dark cloud, a sudden flash of lightning hap-
pened, and after that a great clap of thunder, as is naturally the
effect of it: I was not so much surprised with the lightning, as
I was with a thought which darted into my mind as swift as the
lightning itself: 0 my powder! my very heart sunk within
me, when I thought, that at one blast all my powder might be
destroyed; on which, not my defence only, but the providing
me food, as I thought, entirely depended: I was nothing near so
anxious about my own danger, though had the powder took fire,
I had never known who had hurt me. -

Such impression did this make upon me, that after the storm
was over, I laid aside all my works, my building, and fortifying,
and applied myself to make bags and boxes to separate the pow-
der, and to- keep it a little and a little in a parcel, in hope, that
whatever might come, it might not all take fire at once; and to
keep it so apart, that it should not be possible to make one part
fire another. I finished this work in about a fortnight; and
I think, my powder, which in all was about 24.0 pounds weight,
was divided in not less than a hundred parcels: as to the barrel
that had been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that,
so I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I walled my
kitchen; and the rest I hid up and down in holes among the
rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking very carefully
where I laid it. '
.- In the interval of time while this was doing, I went out once
at least every day with my gun, as well to divert myself, as to
see if I could kill any thing fit for food, and, as near as I could,
to acquaint myself with what the island produced. The first
time I went out I presently discovered that there were goats in
the island, which was a great satisfaction to me; but then it was
attended with this misfortune to me, viz. that they were so shy,
so subtle, and so sm'ft of foot, that it was the most difficult thing
in the world to come at them; but I was not discouraged at this,
not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon
happened; for after I had found their haunts a little, I laid wait
in this manner for them: I observed, if they saw me in the val-
leys, though they were upon the rocks, they would run away as
in a terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the valleys, and
I was upon the rocks, they took no notice of me : from whence
I concluded, that by the position of their optics, their sight was
so directed downward, that they did not readily see objects that
were above them: so afterward I took this method: I always
climbed the rocks first, to get above them, and then had
frequently a fair mark. The first shot I made among these
creatures, I killed a she-goat, which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily; but when
the old one fell, the kid stood stock still by her'till I came and
took her up; and not only so, but when I carried the old one
with me upon my shoulders, the kid followed me quite to my
enclosure, upon which I laid down the dam, and took the kid in
my arms, and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred it
up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forced to kill it and eat
it myself: these two supplied me with flesh a great while, for I -
at sparingly, and saved my provisions (my bread especially) as
much as possibly I could.

Having now fixed my habitation, I found it absolutely neces-
sary to provide a place to make a fire in, and fuel to burn; and
what I did for that, as also how I enlarged my cave, and what
conveniences I made, I shall give a full account of in its place:
but I must first give some little account of myself, and of my
thoughts about living, which it may well be supposed were not
a few.

I had a dismal prospect of my condition; for as I was not cast
away upon that island without being driven, as is said, by a
violent storm quite out of the course of our intended voyage,
and a great way, viz. some hundreds of leagues out of the ordi-
nary course of the trade of mankind, I had great reason to con--
sider it as a determination of Heaven, that in this desolate place,
and in this desolate manner, I should end my life. The tears
would run plentifully down my face when I made these reflec--
tions, and sometimes I would expostulate with myself, why Pro-
vidence should thus completely ruin his creatures, and render
them so absolutely miserable, so without help abandoned, so
entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful
for such a life. _

But something always returned swift upon me to check these
thoughts, and to reprove me; and particularly one day, walking
with my gun in my hand by the sea-side, I was very pensive
upon the subject of my present condition, when reason as it were
expostulated with me the other way, thus: Well, you are in a
desolate condition, it is true; but pray remember, where are the
rest of you? Did not you come eleven of you into the boat?
Where are the ten? Why were they not saved and you lost?
Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here or there?
and then I pointed to the see. All evils are to be considered

- with the good that is in them, and with what worse attends them.

Then it occurred to me again, how well I was furnished for
my subsistence, and what would have been my ease if it had not
happened, which we: at hundred thoumnd to one, that the ship
floated from the place where she first struck, and was driven so
near the shore that I hadtimeto get all these thingsout ofher:
whatwould have been my ease if I had been to have lived in the
condition in which I at first came on shore, without necessaries
of life or necessaries to supply and procure them? Particularly,
said I aloud, (though to myself) what should I have donewith-
out a gun, without ammunition, without any tools to make any
thing, or to work with; without clothes, bedding, a tent, or any
manner of covering: and that now I had all these to a sufficient
quantity, and was in a fair way to provide myself in such a man-
ner, as to live without my gun when my ammunition was spent;
so that I had a tolerable view of subsisting, without any want,
as long as I lived; for I considered from the beginning how I
should provide for the accidents that might happen and for the
time that was to come, even not only after my ammunition
should be spent, but even after my health or strength should
decay.

I confess I had not entertained any notion of my ammunition
being destroyed at one blast, I mean my powder being blown
up by lightning; and this made the thoughts of it so surprising
to me when it lightened and thundered, as I observed just now.

And now being about to enter into a melancholy relation of
a scene of silent life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the
world before, I shall take it from its beginning, and continue it
in its order. It was, by my account, the 30th of Septemeer,
when, in the manner as above said, I first set foot upon this
horrid island, when the sun being, to us, in its autumnal equinox,
was almostjust over my head; for I reckoned myself, by obser-
vation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees and 22 minutes north
of the line.

After I had been there about ten or twelve days, it came into
my thoughts, that I should lose my reckoning of time for want
of books, and pen and ink, and should even forget the Sabbath
days from the working days: but to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large post in capital letters, and making it into
a great cross, I set it up on the shore where I first landed, viz.
I came on :qure her: an the 30th afSept. 16 59. Upon the sides
of this square post, I cut every day a notch with my knife, and
every seventh notch was as long again as the rest, and every first
day of the month as long again as that long one: and thus I kept
my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.

In the next place we are to observe, that among the many
things which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages,
which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of
less value, but not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting
down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper; several
parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping;
three or four compasses, some mathematical instruments, dials,
perspectives, charts, and books of navigation; all which I hud-
dled together, whether I might want them or no: also, I found
three very good bibles 'which came to me in my cargo from Eng-
land, and which I had packed up among my things; some Por-
tuguese books also, and among them two or three popish prayer-
books, and several other books, all which I carefully secured.
And I must not forget, that we had in the ship a dog and two
cats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say some-
thing in its place; for I carried both the cats with me; and as
for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on
shore to me the day after I went on shore with my first cargo,
and was a trusty servant to me many years; I wanted nothing
that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up
to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could
not do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I
husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall shew, that while my
ink lasted, I kept things very exact; but after that was gone, I
could not; for I could not make any ink, by any means that I
could devise.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together; and of these this
of ink was one, as also spade, pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or
remove the earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon
learned to want that without much difficulty.

This want of tools made every work I did go on heavily, and
it was near a whole year before I had entirely finished my little
pale or surrounded habitation: the piles or stakes, which were
as heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in cutting and
preparing in the woods, and more by far in bringing home; so
that I spent sometimes two days in cutting and bringing home
one of those posts, and a third day in driving it into the ground;
for which purpose I got a heavy piece of wood at first, but at
last bethought myself of one of the iron crows, which however,
though I found it, yet it made driving those pass or piles very
laborious and tedious work.

But what need I have been concerned at the tediousness of
any thing I had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor
had I any other employment if that had been over, at least, that
I could foresee, except the ranging the island to seek for food,
which I did more or less every day.

I now began to consider seriously my condition, and the cir-
cumstance I was reduced to, and I drew up the state of my affairs
in writing; not so much to leave them to any that were to come
after me, for I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting myrmind;
and as my reason began now to master my despondency,I began
to comfort myself as well as I could, and to set the good against
the evil, that I might have something to distinguish my use
from worse; and I stated it very impartially, like debtor and
creditor, the comforts I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered,
thus:

EVIL. 0000.
I am cast upon a horrible de- But I am alive, and not

EVIL.
I am singled out and sepa-
rated, as it were, from all the
world, to be miserable.

I am divided from mankind,

7!
GOOD

But I am singled out too from
all the ship's crew to be spared

from death; and He that mira-

culously saved me from death,
can deliver me from this condi-
tion.

But I am not starved and

a solitaire, one banished from perishing on a barren place, af-

human society.

I have not clothes to cover me.

I am without any defence or
means to resist any violence of
man or beast.

I have no soul to speak to, or
relieve me.

fording no sustenance.

But I am in a hot climate
where if I had clothes I could
hardly wear them.

But I am cast on an island,
where I see no wild beasts to
hurt me, as I saw on the coast
ofAfrica; and what ifI had
been shipwrecked there ?

But God wonderfully sent the
ship in near enough to the shore,
that I have gotten out so many
necessary things as will either
supply my wants, or enable me

to supply myself even as long as

I live.

Upon the whole, here was an undoubted testimony, that there
was scarce any condition in the world so miserable, but therewas
something negative or something positive to be thankful for in
it; and let this stand as a direction from the experience of the
most miserable of all conditions in this world, that we may
always find in it something to comfort ourselves from, and to
set, in the description of good and evil, on the credit side of the

account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish my condition,

and given over looking out to sea, to see if I could spy a ship;
I say, giving over these things, I began to apply myself to ac-
commodate my way of living, and to make things as easy to me
as I could.

I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under
the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and
cables, but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind
of wall up against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the outside,
and after some time, I think it was a year and a half, I raised
rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it
with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get to keep out
the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent.

I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this
pale, and into the cave which I had made behind me: but I
must observe too that at first this was a confused heap of goods,
which as they lay in no order, so they took up all my place, I
had no room to turn myself; so I set myself to enlarge my cave
and works farther into the earth; for it was a loose sandy rock,
which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on it: and so when
I found Iwas pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I worked sideways
to the right hand into the rock; and then turning to the right
again, worked quite out, and made me a door to come out, on
the outside of my pale or fortification.

This gave me not only egress and regress, as it were a back-
way to my tent and to my store-house, but gave me room' to
stow my goods.

And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary
things as I found-I most wanted, as particularly a chair and a table ; .
for without these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had
in the world; I could not write or at, or do several things with
so much pleasure without a table.

So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as
reason is the substance and original of the mathematics, so by
stating and squaring every thing by reason, and by making the
most rational judgment of things, every man may be in time
master of every mechanic art. I had never handled a tool in my
life, and yet in time by labour, application, and contrivance, I
found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it,
especially if I had had tools, however I made abundance of
things, even without tools, and some with no more tools than
an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way
before, and that with infinite labour; for example, if I wanted a
board, I had no other way but to cut down a tree, set it on an
edge before me, and hew it flat on either side with my axe, film
had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth
with my adze. It is true, by this method I could make but one
board out of a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but
patience, any more than I had for the prodigious deal of time
and labour which it took me up to make a plank or board: but
my time or labour was little worth, and so it was as well em-
ployed one way as another.

However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above,
in the first place, and this I did out of the short pieces of boards
which I brought on my raft from the ship: but when I had
wrought out some boards, as above,I made large shelves, of the
breadth of a foot and a half one over another, all along one side
of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and iron-work, and in a
word, to separate every thing at large in their places, that I
might come easily at them; I knocked pieces into the wall of the
rock to hang my guns and all things that would hang up.

D
So that had my cave been to be seen, it looked like a general
magazine of all necessary things; and I had every thing so
ready at my hand, that it was a great pleasure to me to see all
my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of all
necessaries so great.

And now it was that I began to keep a joumal of every day's
employment; for indeed at first lwas in too much hurry; and
not only hurry as to labour, but in too much discomposure of
mind, and myjoumal would have been full of many dull things.
For example, I must have said thus: Sept. the 30th, after I got
to shore, and had escaped drowning, instead of being thankful
to GOD for my deliverance, having first vomited with the great
quantity of salt water which was gotten into my stomach, and
recovering myself a little, I ran about the shore, wringing my
hands, and beating my head and face, exclaiming at my misery,
and crying out, I was undone, undone; till, tired and faint, I
was forced to lie down on the ground to repose, but durst not
sleep for fear of being devoured.

Some days after this, and after I had been on board the ship,
and got all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear get-
ting up to the top of a little mountain, and looking out to sea
in hopes of seeing a ship; then fancy at a vast distance I spied
a sail; please myself with the hopes of it; and then, after look-
ing steadily till I was almost blind, lose it quite, and sit down
and weep like a child, and thus increase my misery by my
folly.

But having gotten over these things in some measure, and
having settled my household-stuff and habitation, made me a
table and a chair, and all as handsome about me as I could, I
began to keep my journal, of which I shall here give you the
copy (though in it will be told all these particulars over again) as

long as it lasted; for having no more ink, I was forced to leave
it ofl'.
THE JOURNAL.

Sept. 30, 1659.

I POOR miserable Robinson Crusoe, being shipwrecked, during a
dreadful storm, in the offing, came on shore on this dismal un-
fortunate island, which I called the Island of Despair, all the
rest of the ship's company being drowned, and myself almost
dead.

All the rest of that day I spent in afflicting myself, at the dis-
mal circumstances I was brought to, viz. I had neither food,
house, clothes, weapon, or place to fly to, and in despair of any
relief, saw nothing but death before me, either that I should be
devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages, or starved to
death for want of food. At the approach of night I slept in a
tree, for fear of wild creatures, but slept soundly though it rained
all night.

Ottober I. In the morning I saw to my great surprise, the ship
had floated with the high tide, and was driven on shore again
much nearer the island, which as it was some comfort on one hand,
for seeing her sit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped, if
the wind abated, I might get on board, and get some food or
necessaries out of her for my relief; so, on the other hand, it
renewed my grief at the loss of my comrades, who I imagined if
we had all staid on board might have saved the ship, or at least
that they would not have been all drowned, as they were; and

that, had the men been saved, we might perhaps have built us a
boat out of the ruins of the ship, to have carried us to some

other part of the world. I spent great part of this day in per-
plexing myself on these things; but at length, seeing the ship
almost dry, I went upon the sand as near as I could, and then
swam on board ; this day also it continued raining, though with
no wind at all.

From the Ist of October to the 24th. All these days entirely
spent in making several voyages to get all I could out of the
ship, which I brought on shore, every tide of flood, upon rafts.
Much rain also in these days, though with some intervals of fair
weather: but, it seems, this was the rainy season.

Oct. 20. I overset my raft, and all the goods I had got upon
it; but being in shoal water, and the things being chiefly heavy,
I recovered many of them when the tide was out.

On. 25. It rained all night and all day, with some gusts of
wind, during which time the ship broke in pieces, the wind
blowing a little harder than before, and was no more to be seen,
except the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I spent
this day in covering and securing the goods which I had saved,
that the rain might not spoil them.

Orr. 26. I walked about the shore almost all day, to find out
a place to fix my habitation, greatly concerned to secure myself
from any attack in the night, either from wild beasts or men.
Towards night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semi-circle for my encampment, which I resolved
to strengthen with a work, wall, or fortification made of double
piles, lined within with cables, and without with turf.

From the 26th to the 30th, I worked very hard in carrying
all my goods to my new habitation, though some part of the
time it rained exceeding hard.

The 3ISt, in the morning, I went out into the island with
my gun, to see for some food, and discover the country; when
I killed a she-goat, and her kid followed me home; which I
afterwards killed also, because it would not feed.

November I. I set up my tent under a rock, and lay there for

the first night, making it as large as I could with stakes driven in
to swing my hammock upon.
' Nov. 2. I set up all my chests and boards, and the pieces of
timber which made my rafts, and with them formed a fence round
me, a little within the place I had marked out for my fortification.

Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed two fowls like
ducks, which were very good food. In the afternoon went to
work to make me a table.

NW. 4.. This morning I began to order my times of work,
of going out with my gun, time of sleep, and time of diversion;
'viz. every morning I walked out with my gun for two or three
hours, if it did not rain, then employed myself to work till about
eleven o'clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from twelve
to two I lay down to sleep, the weather being excessive hot, and
then in the evening to work again: the working part of this
day, and of the next, were wholly employed in making my table,
for I was yet but a very sorry workman, though time and ne-
cessity made me a complete natural mechanic soon after, as I
believe it would do any one else.

Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and my dog,
and killed a wild cat, her skin pretty soft, but her flesh good for
nothing: every creature I killed I took of the skins and pre-
served them. Coming back by the sea-shore I saw many sorts
of sea-fowls, which I did not understand; but was surprised
and almost frighted with two or three seals, which, while I was
gazing at, not well knowing what they were, got into the sea,
and escaped me for that time.

NW. 6. After my morning walk I went to work with my
table again, and finished it, though not to my liking: nor was
it long before I learned to mend it.

. Nov. 7. Now it began to be settled fair weather. The 7th,
8th, 9th, roth, and part of the 12th (for the I 1th was Sunday)
I took wholly up to make me a chair, and with much ado
brought it to a tolerable shape, but never to please me; and
even in the making I pulled it in pieces several times. Nate, I
soon neglected my keeping Sundays, for omitting my mark for
them on my post, I forgot which was which.

Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me exceedingly,
and cooled the earth, but it was accompanied with terrible thun--
der and lightning, which frighted me dreadfully for far of my
powder: as soon as it was over I resolved to separate my stock
of powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it might
not be in danger.

Noe. 14, 15, 16. These three days I spent in making little
square chests or boxes, which might hold about a pound, or two
pounds, at most, of powder; and so putting the powder in, I
stowed it in places as secure and remote from one another as pos-
sible. On one of these three days I killed a large bird that was
good to eat, but I know not what to call it.

1V 7:. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent into the
rock, to make room for my farther conveniency. Note, three
things I wanted exceedingly for this work, c'iz. a pick-axe, a
shovel, and a wheel-barrow or basket, so I desisted from my
work, and began to consider how to supply that want, and make
me some tools: as for a pick--axe, I made use of the iron crows,
which were proper enough, though heavy; but the next thing
was a shovel or spade; this was so absolutely necessary, that
indeed I could do nothing effectually without it; but what kind
of one to make I knew not.

No-:-. 18. The next day in searching the woods I found a tree of
that wood, or like it, which in the Brad]: they call the Iron Tree,
for its exceeding hardness; of this, with great labour and almost
spoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it home too with
difficulty enough, for it was exceeding heavy.

The excessive hardness of the wood, and having no other way,
made me a long while upon this machine; for Iworked it
effectually by little and little into the form of a shovel or spade,
the handle exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron shod upon it at bottom, it would not
last me so long; however it served well enough for the uses
which I had occasion to put it to; but never was a shovel, I
believe, made after that fashion, or so long a making.

I was still deficient, for I wanted a basket or a wheel-barrow:
a basket I could not make by any means, having no such things
as twigs that would bend to make wicker ware, at least none yet
found out; and as to a wheel--barrow, I fancied I could make
all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of, neither did I know
how to go about it; besides, I had no possible way to make the
iron gudgeons for the spindle or axis of the wheel to run in, so
I gave it over; and so for carrying away the earth which I dug
out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hod which the la-
bourers carry mortar in, when they serve the bricklayers.

This was notso difficult to me as the making the shovel; and
yet this, and the shovel, and the attempt which I made in vain
to make a wheel-barrow, took me up no less than four days, I
mean always excepting my morning walk with my gun, which I
seldom failed; and very seldom failed also bringing home some-
thing to eat. '

Nov. 23. My other work having now stood still, because of

my making these tools, when they were finished I went on, and
working every day, as my strength and time allowed, I spent
eighteen days entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that
it might hold my goods commodiously.

Note, During all this time, I worked to make this room or
cave spacious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse or ma-
gazine, a kitchen, a dining-room, and a cellar; as for my lodg-
ing, I kept to the tent, except that sometimes in the wet season
of the year, it rained so hard that I could not keep myself dry,
which caused me afterwards to cover all my place within my
pale with long poles in the form of rafters, leaning against the rock,
and load them with flags and large leaves of nee: like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my ave or vault finished,
when on a sudden (it seems I had made it too large) a great
quantity of earth fell down from the top and one side, so much
that in short it frighted me, and not without reason too; for if
I had been under it I had never wanted a grave-digger: upon
this disaster I had a great deal of work to do over again; for I
had the loose earth to carry out, and, which was of more impor-
tance, I had the ceiling to prop up, so that I might be sure no
more would come dovm.

Dec. 11. This day I went to work with it accordingly, and
got two shores or posts pitched upright to the top, with two
pieces of boards across over each post; this I finished the next
day; and setting more posts up with boards, in about a week
more I had the roof secured; and the posts, standing in rows,
served me for partitions to part 0!? my house.

Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed shelves, and
knocked up nails on the posts to hang every thing up that could
be hung up; and now I began to be in some order within
doors.

Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave, and began
to furnish my house, and set up some pieces of boards, like a
dresser, to order my victuals upon; but boards began to be very
scarce with me: also I made me another table.

Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no stirring out.

Dec. 2 5. Rain all day.-

Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than before,
and pleasanter.

Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another, so that I
caught it, and led it home in a string; when I had it home, I
bound and splintered up its leg, which was broke. N. B. I
took such care of it, that it lived, and the leg grew well and as
strong as ever; but by nursing it so long it grew tame, and fed
upon the little green at my door, and would not go away: this
was the first time that I entertained a thought of breeding up
some tame creatures, that I might have food when my powder
and shot was all spent.

Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heat: and no breeze; so that there
was no stirring abroad, except in the evening for food: this time
I spent in putting all my things in order within doors.

yanuary 1. Very hot still, but I went abroad early and late
with my gun, and lay still in the middle of the day. This even-
ing, going farther into the valleys, which lay towards the centre
of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though exceeding
shy and hard to come at; however I resolved to try if I could
not bring my dog to hunt them down.

74):. 2. Accordingly, the next day, I went out with my dog,
and set him upon the goats; but I was mistaken, for they all
faced about upon the dog; and he knew his danger too well, for
he would not come near them.

7am 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being still jealous
of my being attacked by somebody, I resolved to make very
thick and strong.

N. B. This wall being described before, I purposely omit
what was said in the 7ournal ,- it is sufitient to observe,
that I was no less time than from the 3d of January to
the 141/1 of April, working, finishing, and perfecting this
wall, though it was no more than about 24. yards in
length, being a half circle frbm one place in the rock to
another place about eight yards from it, the door of the
cave being in the centre behind it.

All this time I worked very hard, the rains hindering me
many days, nay, sometimes weeks together; but I thought I
should never be perfectly secure until this wall was finished; and
it is scarce credible what inexpressible labour every thing was
done with, especially the bringing piles out of the woods, and

D 28: LIFE asp onzxrvazs

driving them into the ground, for I made them much bigger

than I need to have done.
"'hen this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced

with a turf-wall raised up close to it, I persuaded myself that if
any people were to come on shore there, they would not perceive
any thing like a habitation; and it was very well I did so, as
may be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion.

During this time I made my rounds in the woods for game
every day, when the rain admitted me, and made frequent dis-
coveries in these walks of something or other to my advantage;
particularly I found a kind of wild pigeons, who built not as
wood pigeons, in a tree, but rather as house pigeons, in the holes
of the rocks; and taking some young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did so; but when they grew older they
flew away, which perhaps was at first for want of feeding them,
for I had nothing to give them; however I frequently found
their nests, and got their young ones, which were very good
meat.

And now, in the managing my household affairs, I found my-
self wanting in many things, which I thought at first it was
impossible for me to make, as indeed, as to some of them, it
was; far inflame, I could never make a cask to be hooped: I
had a small runlet or two, a: I char-red be are, but I could never
arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though I spent
many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or joint
the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water;
so I gave that also over.

In the next place, I was at a great loss for candle; so that as
soon as ever it was dark, which was generaJIy by seven o'clock,
I was obliged to go to bed: I remembered the lump of bees-wax
with which I made candles in my flfrican adventure, but I had
none of that now; the only remedy I had, was, that when I had
killed a goat I saved the tallow, and with a little dish made of
clay, which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick of some
oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me light, though not
a clear steady light like a candle. In the middle of all my labours
it happened, that rummaging my things, I found a little bag,
which, as I hinted before, had been filled with corn for the feed-
ing Of poultry--not for this voyage, but before, as I suppose,
when the ship came from Lisbon,- what little remainder of corn
had been in the bag, was all devoured with the rats, and I saw
nothing in the bag but husks and dust; and being willing to
have the bag for some other use, I think it was to put powder
in, when I divided it for fear of the lightning, or some such use,
I shook the husks of corn out of it on one side of my fortifica-
tion under the rock.

It was a little before the great rains, just now mentioned, tha:
I threw this stuff away, taking no notice of any thing, and not
so much as remembering that I had thrown any thing there;
when about a month after, or thereabout, I saw some few stalks
of something green shooting out of the ground, which I fancied
might be some plant I had not seen; but I was surprised and
perfectly astonished, when after a little longer time I saw about
ten or twelve cars come out, which were perfect green barley of
the same kind as our European, nay, as our Eng/ix}: barley.

It is impossible to express the astonishment and confusion of
my thoughts on this occasion; I had hitherto acted upon no
religious foundation at all; indeed I had very few notions of
religion in my head, or had entertained any sense of any thing
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance, or, as we
lightly say, what pleases GOD; without so much as inquiring
into the end of Providence in these things, or his order in
governing events in the world; but after I saw barley grow
there, in a climate which I knew was not proper for corn, and
especially that I knew not how it came there, it startled me
strangely; and I began to suggest, that GOD had miraculously
mused this grain to grow without any help of seed sown, and
that it was so directed purely for my sustenance on that wild
miserable place.

This touched my heart a little, and brought tears out of my
eyes, and I began to bless myself, that such a prodigy of nature
should happen upon my account; and this was the more strange
to me, because I saw near it still, all along by the side of the
rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of
rice, and which I knew, because I had seen it grow in Africa,
when I was ashore there.

I not only thought these the pure productions of Providence
for my support, but not doubting but that there was more in the
place, I went all over that part of the island, where I had been
before, peeping in every comer and under every rock to see for
more of it, but I could not find any; at last it occurred to my
thought, that I had shook a bag of chickens meat out in that
place, and then the wonder began to case; and I must confess,
my religious thankfulness to Gon's providence began to abate
too, upon discovering that all this was nothing but what was
common; though I ought to have been as thankful for so strange
and unforeseen a providence as if it had been miraculous; for it
was really the work of Providence as to me, that should order
or appoint ten or twelve grains of corn to remain unspoiled,
when the rats had destroyed all the rest, as if it had been dropped
from heaven: as also, that I should throw it out in that par-
ticular place, where, it being in the shade of a high rock, it
sprang up immediately; whereas if I had thrown it any where
else at that time, it had been burnt up and destroyed.

I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may be sure, in their
season, which was about the end of :7une, and laying up every
com, I resolved to sow them all again, hoping in time to have
some quantity suflicient to supply me with bread; but it was not
till the fourth year that I could allow myself the last grain of
this corn to eat, and even then but sparingly, as I shall say after-
wards in its order; forI lost all that I sowed the first season, by
not observing the proper time; for I sowed it just before the
dry season, so that it never came up at all, at least not as it
would have done: of which in its place.

Besides this barley, there were, as above, twenty or thirty
stalks of rice, which I preserved with the same care, and whose
use was of the same kind or to the same purpose, viz. To make
me bread, or rather food; for I found ways to cook it up with--
out baking, though I did that also after some time. But to
return to my journal.

I worked excessive hard these three or four months to get my
wall done; and the 14th of April I closed it up, contriving to
go into it, not by a door, but over the wall by a ladder, that
there might be no sign in the outside of my habitation.

dpril x6. I finished the ladder, so I went up with the ladder
to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down on
the inside: this was a complete enclosure to me; for within I
had room enough, and nothing could come at me from without,
unless it could first mount my wall.

The very next day after this wall was finished, I had almost
had all my labour overthrown at once, and myself killed; the
case was thus: As I was busy in the inside of it, behind my tent,
just in the entrance into my cave, I was ten'ibly frighted with a
most dreadful surprising thing indeed ; for on a sudden I found
the earth come crumbling down from the roof of my cave, and
from the edge of the hill, over my head, and two of the posts I
had set up in the cave cracked in a frightful manner: I was
heartily scared, but thought nothing of what was really the cause,
only thinking that the top of my cave was falling in, as some of
it had done before; and for fear I should be buried in it, I ran
forward to my ladder; and not thinking myself safe there neither,
I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of the hill which I ex-
pected might roll down upon me: Iwas no sooner stepped down
upon the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible earth-
quake, for the ground I stood on shook three times at about
eight minutes distance, with three such shocks as would have
overturned the strongest building that could be supposed to have
stood on the earth; and a great piece of the top of a rock, which
stood about half a mile from me next the sea, fell down with
such a terrible noise as I never heard in all my life: I perceived
also the very sea was put into violent motion by it;'and I
believe the shocks were stronger under the water than on the
island.

I was so amazed with the thing itself, having never felt the
like, or discoursed with any one that had, that I was like one
dead or stupified; and the motion of the earth made my stomach
sick, like one that was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling
of the rock awaked me, as it were, and rousing me from the
stupified condition I was in, filled me with horror, and I thought
of nothing then but the hill falling upon my tent, and all my
household goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my
very soul within me a second time.

After the third shock was over, and I felt no more for some
time, I began to take courage, and yet I had not heart enough
to get over my wall again, for fear of being buried alive, but sat
still upon the ground, greatly cast down and disconsolate, not
knowing what to do: all this while I had not the least serious
religious thought, nothing but the common, Lard, have many
up): we; and when it was over, that went away too.

"'hile I sat thus, I found the air overcast, and grow cloudy,
as if it would rain; soon after that the wind rose by little and
little, so that in less than half an hour it blew a most dreadful
hurricane: the sea was all on a sudden covered over with foam
and froth, the shore was covered with the breach of the water,
the trees were torn up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was;
and this held about three hours, and then began to abate, and in
two hours more it was stark calm, and began to rain very hard.

All this while I sat upon the ground, very much terrified and
dejected, when on a sudden it came into my thoughts, that these
winds and rain being the consequences of the earthquake, the
earthquake itself was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again: with this thought my spirits began to revive,
and the rain also helping to persuade me, I went in and sat down
in my tent, but the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready
to be beaten down with it; and I was forced to go into my cave,
though very much afraid and uneasy, for fear it should fall on
my head.

This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz. to cut a hole
through my new fortification like a sink to let water go out,
which would else have drowned my cave. After I had been in
my cave some time, and found still no more shocks of the earth-
quake follow, I began to be more composed; and now, to sup-
port my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to
my little store, and took a small sup of rum, which however I
did then, and always, very sparingly, knowing I could have no
more when that was gone.

It continued raining all that night, and great part of the next
day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more
composed, I began to think of what I had best do, concluding,
that if the island was subject to these earthquakes, there would
be no living for me in a cave, but I must consider of building
me some little hut in an open place, which I might surround
with a wall as I had done here, and so make myself secure from
wild beasts or men: but concluded if I staid where I was, I
Should certainly, one time or other, be buried alive.

With these thoughts I resolved to remove my tent from the
place where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice
of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would cer--88 LIFE axo ADVEx'runzs

minly fall upon my tent: and I spent the next two days, being
the 19th and 20th of dpri], in conniving where and how to
remove my habitation.

The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me that I never
slept in quiet: and yet the apprehension of lying abroad, without
any fence, was almost equal to it; but still, when I looked about
and saw how every thing was put in order, how pleasantly con-
cealed I was, and how safe from danger, it made me very loth to
remove.

In the mean time it occun'ed to me that it would require a
vast deal of time for me to do this, and that I must be contented
to run the venture where I was, till I had formed a camp for
myself, and had secured it so as to remove to it; so with this
resolution I composed myself for a time, and resolved that I
would go to work with all speed to build me a wall with piles
and cables, 55C/. in a circle as before; and set my tent up in it
when it was finished, but that I would venture to stay where I
was till it was finished and fit to remove to. This was the fist.

,{prix' :2. The next morning I began to consider of means to
put this resolve in execution, but I was at a great loss about my
tools ; I had three large axes and abundance of hatchets (for we
carried the hatchets for trafiick with the Indians), but with much
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were all full of
notches and dull, and though I had a grind-stone, I could not
turn it and grind my tools too: this cost me as much thought as
a statesman would have bestowed upon a grand point of politics,
or a judge upon the life and death of a man. At length I con-
trived a wheel with a string, to turn it with my foot, that I might
have both my hands at liberty. Note, I had never seen any such
thing in England, or at least not to take notice how it was done,
though since I have observed it is very common there; besides
that, my grind-stone was very large and heavy. This machine
cost me a full week's work to bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. These two whole days I took up in grinding
my tools, my machine for turning my grind-stone performing
very well.

dpril 30. Having perceived my bread had been low a great
while, now I took a survey of it, and reduced myself to one bis-
cuit cake a day, which made my heart very heavy.

May I. In the morning, looking towards the sea-side, the tide
being low, I saw something lie on the shore bigger than ordinary ;
and it looked like a cask. When I came to it, I found a small
barrel, and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship, which
were driven on shore by the late hurricane; and looking towards
the wreck itself, I thought it seemed to lie higher out of the
water than it used to do: I examined the barrel which was driven
on shore, and soon found it was a barrel of gunpowder, but it
had taken water, and the powder was caked as hard as a stone;
however I rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went on
upon the sands as near as I could to the wreck of the ship, to
look for more.

When I came down to the ship, I found it strangely removed:
the fore-castle, which lay before buried in sand, was heaved up
at least six foot; and the stern, which was broke to pieces and
parted from the rest by the force of the sea, soon after I had left
rummaging her, Was tossed, as it were, up, and cast on one side,
and the sand was thrown so high on that side next her stern, that
whereas there was a great place of water before, so that I could
not come within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without swim--
ming, I could now walk quite up to her when the tide was out.
I was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded it must be
done by the earthquake: and as by this violence the ship was
more broken open than formerly, so many things came daily on
Shore, which the sea had loosened, and which the winds and
water rolled by degrees to the land.

' This wholly diverted my thoughts from the design of removing
my habitation; and I busied myself mightily that day especially,
in searching whether I could make any way into the ship; but
I found nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that all the
inside of the ship was choked up with sand: however, as I had
learnt not to despair of any thing, I resolved to pull every thing
to pieces that I could of the ship, concluding, that every thing I
could get from her would be of some use or other to me.

.May 3. I began with my saw, and cut a piece of a beam
through, which I thought held some of the upper part or quarter
deck together; and when I had cut it through, I cleared away
the sand as well as I could from the side which lay highest; but
the tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for that time.

Ala} 4.. I went a fishing, but caught not one fish that I durst
eat of, till I was weary of my sport; when just going to leave
oil", I caught a young dolphin. I had made me a long line of
some rope yam, but I had no hooks, yet I frequently caught fish
enough, as much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the sun,
and eat them dn.

Jl/[zo' 5. \Vorked on the wreck, cut another beam asunder,
and brought three great fir planks oil" from the decks, which I
tied together, and made swim on shore when the tide of flood
came on.

Why 6. \Vorked on the wreck, got several iron bolts out of
her, and other pieces of iron-work; worked very hard, and came
home very much tired, and had thoughts of giving it over.

Ma} 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an intent not to
work, but found the weight of the wreck had broke itself down,
the beams being cut, that several pieces of the ship seemed to lie
loose: and the inside of the hold lay so open, that I could see .
into it, but almost full of water and sand.

May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron crow to
wrench up the deck, which lay now quite clear of the water or
sand; I wrenched open two planks, and brought them on shore
also with the tide: I left the iron crow in the wreck for next
day.

My 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow made way
into the body of the wreck, and felt several asks, and loosened
them with the crow, but could not break them up; I felt also
the roll of English lead, and could stir it, but it was too heavy
to remove.

May 10, II, 12, 13, I4. Went every day to the wreck, and
got a great many pieces of timber, and boards, or plank, and
two or three hundred weight of iron.

May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I could not cut a
piece of? the roll of lead, by placing the edge of one hatchet, and
driving it with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half
in the water, I could not make any blow to drive the hatchet.

Ma} 16. It had blowed hard in the night, and the wreck
appeared more broken by the force of the water; but I staid so
long in the woods to get pigeons for food, that the tide prevented
me going to the wreck that day.

May 17. I saw some pieces of the wreck blown on shore, at
a great distance, near two miles ofl' me, but resolved to see what
they were, and found it was a piece of the head, but too heavy
for me to bring away.

May 24.. Every day to this day I worked on the wreck, and
with hard labour I loosened some things so much with the crow,
that the first blowing tide several casks- floated out, and two of
the seamen's chests; but the wind blowing from the shore,
nothing came to land that day but pieces of timber, and a hogs-
head, which had some Brazil pork in it, but the salt water and
sand had spoiled it.

I continued this work every day to the 15th of 7101:, except
the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during
this part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I
might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time I had '92 LIFE nxu onax'rt'nts

gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work enough to have built
a good boat, if I had known how; and also, I got at several
times, and in several pieces, near 100 weight of the sheet'lad.

:7": l6. Going down to the sea side, I found a large tortoise
or turtle; this was the first I had seen, which it seems was only
my misfortune, not any defect of the place, or scarcity; for had
I happened to be on the other side of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day ; asl found afterwards; but per-
haps had paid clear enough for them.

71m: 17 I spent in cooking the turtle; I found in her three.
score eggs; and her flesh was to me at that time' the most
savoury and pleasant that ever I tasted in my life, having had
no flesh, but of goats and fowls, since I landed in this horrid

lace.

P Z714>>: 18. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I thought at
this time the rain felt cold, and I was something chilly, which I
knew was not usual in that latitude.

71m: 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the weather had been
cold.

71m: 20. No rest all night, violent pains in my head, and
feverish.

71m: 21. Very ill, frighted almost to death with the appre-
hensions of my sad condition, to be sick and no help: Prayed to
Goo for the first time since the storm of Hull, but scarce knew
what I said, or why; my thoughts being all confused.

7mm 22. A little better, but under dreadful apprehensions of
sickness.

71m: 2 3. Very bad again, cold and shivering, and then a
violent head-ach.

71m: 24.. Much better.

714m 25. An ague very violent ; the fit held me seven hours,
cold fit and hot, with faint sweats after it.

fun: 26. Better; and having no victuals to at, too): my
gun, but found myself very weak; however I killed a she-goat,
and with much difficulty got it home, and broiled some of it,
and eat; I would fain have stewed it, and made some broth, but
had no pot.

3'14>>: 27. The ague again so violent, that I lay a-bed all day,
and neither eat or drank. I was ready to perish for thirst, but
so weak I had not strength to stand up, or to get myself any
water to drink: prayed to GOD again, but was light-headed;
and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to
say; only I lay and cried, Lord, look upon me; Lord, pity me;
Lord, have mercy upon me : I suppose I did nothing else for two
or three hours, till the fit wearing OR, I fell asleep, and did not
wake till far in the night; when I waked I found myself much
refreshed, but weak and exceeding thirsty: however, as I had
no water in my whole habitation, I was forced to lie till morning,
and went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible
dream.

I thought that I was sitting on the ground on the outside Of
my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake,
and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a
bright flame of fire, and alight upon the ground. He wa all
over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look
towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful,
impossible for words to describe; when he stepped upon the
ground with his feet I thought the earth trembled just as it had
done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to my appre--
hension as if it had been filled with flashes of fire.

He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved for--
ward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand to
kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some distance,
he spoke to me, or I heard a voice so terrible, that it is impos-
sible to express the terror of it; all that I ean say I understood
was this, ' Seeing all time thing: have not brought the: to repent-
ante, now thou shall die ;' at which words I thought he lifted up
the spear that was in his hand to kill me.

No one, that shall ever read this account, will expect thatI
should be able to describe the honors of my soul at this terrible
vision; I mean, that even while it was a dream, I even dreamed
of t. .ose horrors; nor is it any more possible to describe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I awaked, and.
found it was but a dream.

I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had received by
the good instruction of my father was then worn out by an un-
interrupted series, for eight years, of sea-faring wickedness, and
a constant conversation with nothing but such as were like my-
self, wicked and profane to the last degree: I do not remember
that I had in all that time one thought that so much as tended
either to looking upwards towards GOD, or inwards towards a
reflection upon my own ways: but a certain stupidity of soul,
without desire of good, or conscience of evil, had entirely over-
whelmed me, and I was all that the most hardened, unthinking,
wicked creature among our common sailors can be supposed to
be, not having the least sense, either of the fear of GOD in danger,
or of thankfulness to Goo in deliverances.

In the relating what is already past of my story, this will be
the more easily believed, when I shall add, that through all the
variety of miseries that had to this day befallen me, I never had
so much as one thought of it being the hand of Goo, or that it
was a just punishment for my sin, my rebellious behaviour
against my father, or my present sins, which were great; or so
much as a punishment for the general course of my wicked life.
When I was on the desperate expedition on the desert shores of
Africa, I never had so much as one thought of what would
become of me; or one wish to Gov to direct me whither I
should go, or to keep me from the danger which apparently sur-
rounded me, as well from voracious creatures as cruel savages:
but I was merely thoughtless of a Goo, or a Providence; acted
like a mere brute from the principles of Nature, and by the
dictates of common sense only, and indeed hardly that.

When I was delivered, and taken up at sea by the Portugal
mptain, well used, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well
as charitably, I had not the least thankfulnees on my thoughts :
when again I was shipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drown-
.ing on this island, I was as far from remorse, or looking on it
as ajudgment; I only said to myself often, that I was an unfor-
tunate dog, and born to be always miserable.

It is true, when I got on shore first here, and found all my
ship's crew drowned, and myself spared, I was surprised with a
kind of ecstasy, and some transports of soul, which, had the
grace of Goo assisted, might have come up to true thankfulness;
but it ended where it begun, in a mere common flight of joy, or,
as I may say, being glad I was alive, without the least reflection
upon the distinguishing goodness of the hand which had pre-
served me, and had singled me out to be preserved, when all
the rest were destroyed; or an inquiry why providence had been
thus merciful to me; even just the same common sort of joy
which seamen generally have, after they have got safe on shore _
from a shipwreck, which they drown all in the next bowl of
punch, and forget, almost as soon as it is over; and all the rest
of my life was like it.

Even when I was afterwards, on due consideration, made sen-
sible of my condition; how I was cast on this dreadful place, out
of the reach of human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect
of redemption; as soon as I saw but a prospect of living, and
that I should not starve and perish for hunger, all the sense of
of my affliction wore off, and I began to be very easy, applied
myself to the works proper for my preservation and supply, and
was far enough from being afflicted at my condition, as ajudg-
meat from heaven, or as the hand of Goo against me: these
Were thoughts which very seldom entered into my head.

The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my journal, had
at first some little influence upon me, and began to affect me
with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something miraculous
in it; but as soon as ever that part of thought was removed, all
the impression which was raised from it wore oil" also, as I have
noted already.

Even the earthquake, though nothing could be more terrible
in its nature, or more immediately directing to the invisible.
power, which alone directs such things; yet no sooner was the
first fright over, but the impression it had made went of? also;
I had no more sense of Goo, or his judgments, much less of the
present afiliction of my circumstances being from his hand, than
if I had been in the most prosperous condition of life.

But now, when I began to be sick, and a leisurely view of the
miseries of death came to place itself before me; when my spirits
began to sink under the burden of a strong distemper, and nature
was exhausted with the violence of the fever; conscience, that
had slept so long, began to awake, and I began to reproach my-
self with my past life, in which I had so evidently, by uncommon
wickedness, provoked the justice of Goo to lay me under un-
common strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a manner.

These reflections oppressed me from the second or third day
of my distemper, and in the violence, as well of the fever as of
the dreadful reproaches of my conscience, extorted some words
from me, like praying to God, though I cannot say they were
either a prayer attended with desires, or with hopes; it was
rather the voice of mere fright and distress: my thoughts were
confused, the convictions great upon my mind, and the horror
of dying in such a miserable condition, raised vapours into my
head with the mere apprehensions; and, in these hurries of my
soul, I know not what my tongue might express. But it was
rather exclamation; such as, Lord! what a miserable creature
am I ! If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for want of help,
and what will become of me? Then the tears burst out of my
eyes, and I could say no more for a good while. i
In this interval the good advice of my father came to my mind,
and presently his prediction, which I mentioned in.the beginning '
of this story; 'viz. That if I did take this foolish step, God would
not hless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon
having neglected his counsel, when there night be none to assist in
my recovery. Now, said I aloud, my dear father's words are
come to pass: Goo's justice has overtaken me, and I have none
to help or hear me; I rejected the voice of Providence, which
had mercifully put me in a posture or station of life wherein I
might have been happy and easy; but I Would neither see it
myself, nor learn to know the blessing of it from my parents ; I
left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am left to mourn
under the consequences of it; I refused their help and assistance,
who would have lifted me into the world, and would have made
every thing easy to me; and now I have difficulties to struggle
with, too great for even nature itself to support, and no assist-
ance, no help, no comfort, no advice. Then I cried out, Lord,
be my help, for I am in great distress!

This was the first prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made
for many years. But I return to my journal.

3'une 28. Having been somewhat refreshed with the sleep I
I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I got up; and though
the fright and terror of my dream was very great, yet I con-
sidered, that the fit of the ague would return again the next day,
and now was my time to get something to refresh and support
myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I did, I filled a
large square case bottle with water, and set it upon my table, in
reach of my bed; and to take of? the chill or aguish disposition
of the water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it, and
mixed them together: then I got me a piece of the goat's flesh,
and broiled it on the coals, but could eat very little. I walked
about, but was very weak, and, withal, very sad and heavy-
hearted under a sense of my miserable condition, dreading the

z
return of my distemper the next day: at night I made my sup-
per of three of the turtle's eggs, which I roasted in the ashes,
and eat, as we call it, in the shell; and this was the first bit of
meatI had ever asked GOD's blessing to, even, as I could re-
member, in my whole life.

After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found myself so weak,
that I could hardly carry the gun (for I never went out without
that) ; so I went but a little way, and sat down upon the ground,
looking out upon the sea, which was just before me, and very
calm and smooth. As I sat here, some such thoughts as these
occurred to me:

What is the earth and sea, of which I have seen so much?
Whence is it produced? And what am I, and all the other crea-
tures, wild and tame, human and brutal; whence are we?

Sure we are all made by some secret power, who formed the
earth and sea, the air and sky ; and who is that?

Then it followed, most naturally: it is GOD that has made it
all. Well, but then it came on strangely; if GOD has made all
these things, he guides and governs them all, and all things that
concern them; for the Being that could make all things, must
certainly have power to guide and direct them.

If so, nothing can happen in the great circuit of his works,
either without his knowledge or appointment.

And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows
thatI am here, and am in this dreadful condition; and if nothing
happens without his appointment, he has appointed all this to
befal me.

Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict any of these
conclusions; and therefore it rested upon me with the greater
force, that it must needs be, that GOD had appointed all this to
befal me; that I was brought to this miserable circumstance by
his direction, he having the sole power, not of me only, but of
every thing that happened in the world. Immediately it followed.
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to he thus
used .?

My conscience presently checked me in that inquiry, as if I
had blasphemed; and methought it spoke to me, like a voice;
Wreteh! dost thou ask what thou hast done .? Look back upon a
dreadful mispent life, and ask thyself what thou hast not done?
Ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed? Why wert
thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads? killed in the fight when
the ship was taken by the Sallee man of war? devoured by the
wild beasts on the coast of Africa? or, drowned HERE, when all
the new perished hut thyself? Dost thou ask, What have I
done ?

I was struck with these reflections as one astonished, and had
not a word to say, no, not to answer to myself; but rose up
pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over
my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were
sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down
in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now,
as the apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified me
very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brasilians take
no physic but their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I
had a piece of a roll of tobacco in one of the chests, which m
quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured.

I went, directed by Heaven, no doubt! for in this chest I
found a cure both for soul and body! I opened the chest, and
found what I looked for, viz. the tobacco; and as the few books
I had saved lay there too, I took out one of the bibles which I
mentioned before, and which, to this time, I had not found lei-
sure, or so much as inclination, to look into; I say I took it
out, and brought both that and the tobacco with me to the
table.

What usetomakeofthe tobacco I knewnot,as tomydis-
temper, or whether it was good for it or no; but I tried several
experiments with it, as if I resolved it should hit one way or
other: I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,
which indeed at first almost stupified my brain, the tobacco being
green and strong, and that I had not been much used to it; then
I took some, and steeped it an hour or two in some rum, and
resolved to take a dose of it when I lay down; and lastly, I
burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose close over the
smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well for the heat as the
virtue of it, and I held almost to suffocation.

In the interval of this operation, I took up the bible, and be-
gan to read; but my head was too much disturbed with the
tobacco to bear reading, at least at that time; only having opened
the book casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these, Call on me in the day of trauble, and I will deliver thee,
and thou shalt glarifiv me.

The words were very apt to my case, and made some impres-
sion upon my thoughts at the time of reading them, though not
so much as they did afterwards; for, as for being delivered, the
word had no sound, a: I may my, to me; the thing was so re--
mote, so impossible in my apprehension of things, that I began
to say as the children of Israel did when they were promised
flesh to eat, Can God spread a table in the wilderness ? so I began
to say, Can Goo himself deliver me from this place? And as it
was not for many years that any hope appeared, this prevailed
very often upon my thoughts; but, however, the words made a
very great impression upon me, and I mused upon them very
often. It grew now late, and the tobacco had, as I said, dozed
my head so much, that I inclined to sleep; so I left my
lamp burning in the cave, lest I should want any thing in the
night, and went to bed: but before I lay down, I did what I
never had done in all my life; I kneeled down and prayed to
Goo to fulfil the promise to me, that if I walled upon him in the
day of trouble, he would deliver me. After my broken and
imperfect prayer was over, I drank the rum in which I had
steeped the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the tobacco,
that indeed I could scarce get it down. Immediately upon this
Iwent to bed, and I found presently it flew up into my head
violently; but I fell into a sound sleep, and waked no more, till
by the sun it must necessarily be near three o'clock in the after-
noon the next day; nay, to this hourI am partly of the opinion,
that I slept all the next day and night, and till almost three the
day after; for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a day out
of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it appeared some
years after I had done; for if I had lost it by crossing and re-
crossing the line, I should have lost more than one day: but cer-
tainly I lost a day in my account, and never knew which way.

Be that however one way or other, when I wakcd, I found
myself exceedingly refreshed, and my spirits lively and cheerful.
When I got up, I was stronger than I was the day before, and
my stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in short, I had no
fit the next day, but continued much altered for the better. This
was the 29th.

The 30th was my well day, of course; and I went abroad
with my gun, but did not care to travel too far: I killed a. sea-
fowl or two, something like a brand goose, and brought them
home, but was not very forward to eat them: so I eat some
more of the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This evening
I renewed the medicine which I had supposed did me good the
day before, viz. the tobacco steeped in rum; only I did not take
so much as before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke: however, I was not so well the next day,
which was the first of 7111}, as I hoped I should have been; for
I had a little spice of the cold fit, but it was not much.

7145' 2. I tenewed the medicine all the three ways, and dosed
myself with it at first, and doubled the quantity which I drank.

714!) 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though I did not
recover my full strength for some weeks after. While I was thus
gathering strength, my thoughts run exceedingly upon the scrip-
ture, I will deliver thee; and the impossibility of my deliverance
lay much upon my mind, in bar of my ever expecting it: but as
I was discouraging myself with such thoughts, it occurred to my
mind, that I pored so much upon my deliverance from the main
afliiction, that I disregarded the deliverance I had received; and
I was, as it were, made to ask myself such questions as these;
viz. Have I not been delivered, and wonderfully too, from sick-
ness? from the most distressed condition that could be, and that
was so frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it? had
I done my part? God had delivered me: hut I had not glorified
him : that is to say, I had not owned and been thankful for that
as a deliverance; and how could I expect greater deliverance?

This touched my heart very much, and immediately I kneeled
down, and gave God thanks, aloud, for my recovery from my
sickness.

7140 4. In the morning I took the bible; and, beginning at
the New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and imposed
upon myself to road awhile every morning and every night, not
tying myself to the number of chapters, but as long as my
thoughts should engage me: it was not long after I set seriously
to this work, but I found my heart more deeply and sincerely
affected with the wickedness of my past life; the impression of
my dream revived, and the words, All these thing: have not
brought thee to repentance, ran seriously in my thoughts. I was
earnestly begging of Goo to give me repentance, when it hap-
pened providentially the very day, that, reading the scripture, I
came to these words, He 1': exalted a Prince and a Saviour, to
give repentance, and to give remission. I threw- down the book,
and with my heart as well as my hands lifted up to heaven, in a
kind of ecstasy of joy, I cried out aloud, yew, thou Son of David,
7m", thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give one repentance!
This was the first time that I could say, in the true sense of
the words, that I prayed in all my life ; for now I prayed with
a sense of my condition, and with a true scripture view of hope,
founded on the encouragement of the word of Goo; and from
this time, I may say, I began to have hope that Goo would hear
me.

Now I began to construe the words mentioned above " Call
on me, and I will deliver thee," in a difi'erent sense from what I
had ever done before; for then I had no notion of any thing
being called deliverance, but my being delivered from the capti-
vity I was in; for though I was indeed at large in the place, yet
the island was certainly a prison to me, and that, in the worst
sense in the world; but now I learned to take it in another sense.
Now I looked back upon my past life with such horror, and my
sins appwed so dreadful, that my soul sought nothing of Goo,
but deliverance from the load of guilt that bore down all my
comfort. As for my solitary life, it was nothing; I did not so
much as pray to be delivered from it, or think of it; it was all
of no consideration, in comparison of this: and I add this part
here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they come
to a true sense of things, they will find deliverance from sin a
much greater blessing than deliverance from affliction.

But, leaving this part, I retum to my journal.

My condition began now to be, though not less miserable as
to my way of living, yet much easier to my mind; and my
thoughts being directed by a constant reading the Scripture, and
praying to Goo, to things of a higher nature, I had a great deal
of comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of: also as my
health and strength returned, I bestirred myself to furnish my--
self with every thing that I wanted, and make my way of living
as regular as I could.

From the 4th of fill} to the 14th, I was chiefly employed in
walking about with my gun in my hand, a little and a little at a
time, as a man that was gathering up his strength after a fit of
sickness; for it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to
what weakness I was reduced. The application which I made
use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had never cured an
ague before; neither can I recommend it to any one to practise
by this experiment; and though it did carry off the fit, yet it
rather contributed to weaken me; for I had frequent convulsions
in my nerves and limbs for some time.

I learnt from it also this in particular, that being abroad in
the rainy season was the most pernicious thing to my health that
could be, especially in those rains which came attended with
storms and hurricanes of wind; for as the rain which came in a
dry season was always most accompanied with such storms, so
I found this rain was much more dangerous than the rain which
fell in Septtmber and October.

I had been now in this unhappy island above ten months; all
possibility of deliverance from this condition seemed to be
entirely taken from me; and I firmly believed that no human
shape had ever set foot upon that place. Having now secured
my habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a great desire
to make a more perfect discovery of the island, and to see what
other productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.

It was the 15th of 7:41} that I began to take a more particular
survey of the island itself; I went up the creek first, where, as I
hinted, I brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I eame
about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any higher, and
that it was no more than a little brook of running water, and
very fresh and good; but this being the dry season, there was
hardly any water in some parts of it, at least not enough to run
in any stream, so as it could be perceived.

On the bank of this brook I found many pleasant momma: or.
meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass; and on the
rising parts of them next to the higher grounds, where the water,
as it might be supposed, never overflowed, I found a great deal
of tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very strong stalk:
there were divers other plants which I had no notion of, or un-
derstanding about; and might perhaps have virtues of their own,
which I could not find out.

I searched for the (armor root, which the Indian: in all that

climate make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large
plants of aloes, but did not then understand them: I saw several

sugar canes, but wild, and for want of cultivation, imperfect. I
contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came
back musing with myself what course I might take to know the
virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should
discover, but could bring it to no conclusion: for, in short, I
had made so little observation while I was in the Brad/5, that I
knew little of the plants of the field, at least very little that might
serve me to any purpose now in my distress.

The next day, the 16th, I went up the same way again; and,
after going something farther than I had done the day before, I
found the brook and the savanna: began to cease, and the coun-
try became more woody than before. In this part I found diffe-
rent fruits, and particularly I found melons upon the ground in
great abundance, and grapes upon the trees; the vines had spread
indeed over the trees, and the clusters of grapes were just now
in their prime, very ripe and rich. This was a surprising dis-
covery, and I was exceeding glad of them, but I was warned
by my experience to eat sparingly of them, remembering that,
when I was ashore in Barby, the eating of grapes killed several
of our Englishmen who were slaves there, by throwing them into
fluxes and fevers: but I found an excellent use for these grapes,
and thatwas tocure ordrythem in the sun and keep them as
dried grapes or raisins are kept, which I thought would be, as
indeed they were, as wholesome, and as agreeable to eat, when

no grapes might be had.
a 2
I spent all that evening there, and went not back to my habi-
tation, which by the way was the first night, as I might say, I
had lain from home. In the night I took my first contrivance,
and got up into a tree, where I slept well, and the next morning
proceeded upon my discovery, travelling near four miles, as I
mightjudge by the length of the valley, keeping still due north,
with a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me.

At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the
country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of
fresh water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran
the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant
verdure or flourishing of spring, that it looked like a planted
garden.

I descended a little on the side of that delicious valley, survey--
ing it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with other
afflicting thoughts) to think that this was all my own, that I was
king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of
possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it in inherit-
ance, as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw
here abundance of cocoa-trees, orange and lemon, and Citron--
trees, but all wild, and few bearing any fruit; at least, not then:
however, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant
to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards
with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and
refreshing.

I found nowI had business enough to gather and carry home;
and resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and
lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was
approaching.

In order to do this I gathered a great heap of grapes in one
place, and a lesser heap in another place, and a great parcel of
limes and lemons in another place; and taking a few of each with
me, I travelled homeward, and resolved to come again, and bring
a bag or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home.

Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came
home (so I must now call my tent, and my ave); but before I
got thither, the grapes were spoiled; the richnus of the fruit,
and the weight of the juice, having broken them, and bruised
them, they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they
were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me
two small bags to bring home my harvest. ButI was surprised,
when coming to my heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine
when I gathered them, I found them all spread abroad, trod to
pieces, and dragged about, some here, some there, and abundance
eaten and devoured. By this I concluded there were some wild
creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were
I knew not.

However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they
would be destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed
with their own weight, I took another course; for I gathered a
large quantity of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches
of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the sun; and as for
the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I could well
stand under.

WhenI came home from this journey, I contemplated with
great pleasure on the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasant-
ness of the situation, the security from storms on that side of the
water, and the wood; and concluded that I had pitched upon a
place to fix my abode which was by Far the worst part of the
country. Upon the whole, I began to consider of removing my
habitation, and to look out for a place equally safe as where I
now was situated, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful part of the
island.
This thought ran long in my head, and I w excwding fond
of it for some time, the plmntnes of the place tempting me;
but when I mine to a nearer view of it, and to consider that I
was now by the sea-side, where it was at last possible that some-
thing might happen to my advantage, and that the same ill fate
that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy wretches
to the same place; and though it was scarce probable that any
such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the
hills and woods, in the centre of the island, was to anticipate my
bondage, and to render such an affair not only improbable, but
impossible; and that therefore I ought not by any means to
remove.

However, I was so enamoured of this place, that I spent
much of my time there for the whole remaining part of the
month of 7140-,- and though, upon second thoughts I resolved as
above, not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and
surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled between
with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or
three nights together, always going over it with a ladder, as
before; so that I fancied now I had my country house, and my
sea-coast house: and this work took me up to the beginning of
August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my
labour, but the rains came on, and made me stick close to my
first habitation; for though I had made me a tent like the other,
with a piece of a sail, and spread it very well, yet I had not the
shelter of a hill to keep me from storms, nor a awe behind me to
retreat into when the rains were exn-aordinary.

About the beginning of August, a: I said, I had finished my
bower, and began to enjoy myself. The third of Augurt I found
the grapes I had hung up were perfectly dried, and indwd were
excellent good raisins of the sun: so I began to take them down
fromthe trees, anditwasveryhappythat I didso; forthe rains
which followed would have spoiled them, and I had lost the best
part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred large
bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and
carried most of them home to my cave, but it began to rain;
and from thence, which was the fourteenth of August, it rained
more or less every day, till the middle of October: and some-
times so violently, that I could not stir out of my cave for several
days.

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my
family: I had been concerned for the loss of one of my eats,
who ran away from me, or, as I thought, had been dead; and I
heard no more tale or tidings of her, till, to my astonishment,
she came home about the end of August, with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because though I had killed a
wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was a quite
different kind from our European cats; yet the young cats were
the same kind of house breed like the old one; and both my at:
being females, I thought it very strange: but from these three
cats, I afterwards came to be so pestered with cats, that I was
forced to kill them like vermin, or wild beasts, and to drive them
from my house as much as possible.

From the fourteenth of August to the twenty-sixth, incessant
rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very eareful not to be
much wet. In this confinement I began to be straitened for
food: but venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat: and the
last day, which was the twenty-sixth, found a very large tortoise,
which was street tome; and myfoodwasregulated thus: Ieat
a bunch of raisins for my breakfast, a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled (for to my great misfor-
tune I had no vessel to boil or stew any thing), and two or three
of the turtle's eggs for supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I workedI to erz AND onsx'ruass

daily two or three hours at enlarging my ave; and, by degrees,
worked it on towards one side, till I came to the outside of the
hill, and made a door or way out, which came beyond my fence
or wall; and so I came in and out this way: but I was not per-
fectly easy at lying so open; for as I had managed myself be-
fore, I was in a perfect enclosure, whereas now I thought I lay
exposed; and yet I could not perceive that there was any living
thing to fear, the biggest creature that I had seen upon the island
being a goat.

September the thirtieth. I was now come to the unhappy
anniversary of my landing: I cast up the notches on my post,
and found I had been on shore three hundred and sixty-five days.
I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting it apart to a religious
exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with the most serious
humiliation, confessing my sins to GOD, acknowledging his righ-
teous judgments upon me, and praying to him to have mercy on
me, through Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least re-
freshment for twelve hours, even to the going down of the sun,
I then at a biscuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes, and went to
bed, finishing the day as I began it.

I had all this time observed no Sabbath--day; for as at first I
had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had after some time
omitted to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what
any of the days were; but now, having cast up the days as
above, I found I had been there a year; so I divided it into
weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I
found at the end of my account I had lost a day or two in my
reckoning.

A little after this my ink began to fail me, and so I contented
myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most
remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memo-
randum of other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now to appear
regular to me, and I learned to divide them so as to provide for
them accordingly. But I bought all my experience before I had
it; and this I am going to relate, was one of the most discou-
raging experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned, that
I had saved the few ears of barley and rice which I had so sur-
prisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and be-
_ lieve there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about tsirenty of
barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it after the
rains, the sun being in its southern position going from me.

Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well as I could,

with my wooden spade, and dividing it into two parts, I sowed
my grain; but as I was sowing, it casually occurred to my thought,
that I would not sow it all at first, beeause I did not know when
was the proper time for it; so I sowed about two thirds of the
seeds, leaving about a handful of each. It was a great comfort
to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of that I sowed
this time came to any thing; for the dry months following,-the
earth having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no mois-
ture to assist its growth, and never came up at all, till the wet
season had come again, and then it grew as if it had been newly
sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which I easily imagined
was by the drought, I sought for a moister piece of ground to
make another trial in; and I dug up a piece of ground near my
new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox ,- and this, having the rainy months of
Mn}: and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and
yielded a very good crop; but having part of the seed left only,
and notdaring to sowall thatIhadyet,I hadbutasmall quan-
tity at last, my whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of
each kind.

But by this experience I was made master of my business, and
knew exactly when the proper season was to sow; and that I
might expect two seed times, and two harvests every year.5

While this corn was growing, I made a little discovery, which
was of use to me afterwards. As soon as the rains were over,
and the weather began to settle, which was about the month of
November, I made a visit up the country to my bower, where
though I had not been some months, yet I found all things just
as I left them. The circle or double hedge that I had made, was
not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut oil" of
some trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out, and grown
with long branches, as much as a willow tree usually shoots the
first year after lopping its head. I could not tell what tree to all
it that these stakes were cut from. I was surprised, and yet very
well pleased, to see the young trees grow; and I pruned them,
and led them up to grow as much alike as I could, and it is
scarce credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in three
years; so that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-
five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call
them, soon covered it; and it was a complete shade, suficient to
lodge under all the dry season.

This made me resolve to cut some more stakes, and make
me a hedge like this in a semicircle round my wall, I mean that
of my first dwelling, which I did; and placing the trees or stakes
in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence,
they grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habita-
tion, and afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe
in its order.

I found now, that the seasons of the year might generally be
divided, not into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the
rainy seasons and the dry seasons, which were generally thus:

The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the
winds happened to blow; but this was the general observation I
made. After I had found, by experience, the ill consequence of
being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with pro-
vision beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out; and I
sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months.

In this time I found much employment, (and very suitable
also to the time) for I found great occasion of many things
which I had no way to furnish myself with, but by hard labour-
and constant application: particularly, I tried many ways to
make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for the
purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy,
I used to take great delight in standing at a brim-maker's in
the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-
ware; and being, as boys usually are, very ofiicious to help, and
a great observer of the manner how they worked thou things,
and sometimes lending a hand, I had by this means so full know-
ledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the
materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that
tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be
as tough as the :alla-w: and willows, and Och'fJ, in England; and
I resolved to tn.

Accordingly the next day I went to my country house, as I
called it, and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to
my purpose as much as I could desire; whereupon I came the
next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity,
which I soon found, for there was a great plenty of them: these
I set up to dry within my circle or hedges; and when they were
fit for use, I carried them to my cave; and here during the next
season I employ ed m\ self in making (a: cull a: I could) a great
many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any
thing, as I had occasion , and though I did not finish them very
handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my
purpose; and thus afterwards I took care never to be without
them; and as my wicker-war: decayed, I made more; especially
I made strong deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of sacks,
when I should come to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difliculty, and employed a world of
time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to sup-
ply two wants. I had no vessels to hold any thing that was
liquid, except two rundlets, which were almost full of rum, and
some glass bottles, some of the common size, and others which
were case-bottles square, for the holding of waters, spirits, (it.
I had not so much as a pot to boil any thing in, except a great
kettle which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for
such uses as I desired for it, viz. to make broth, and stew a bit
of meat by itselfi The second thing I would fain have had, was
a tobacco-pipe, but it was impossible for meto make one; how-
ever I found a contrivance for that too at last.

I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes of
piles, and in this wicker work, all the summer, or dry season;
when mother business took me up more time than it could be deg
imagined I could spare.

I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to see the whole
island, and that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where
I built my bower, and where I had an opening quite to the sea,
on the other side of the island. I now resolved to travel quite
across to the sea-shore on that side: so taking my gun, and
hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder and shot
than usual, with two biscuit-cakes, and a great bunch of raisins
in my pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When I had
passed the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within
view of the sea, to the west,- and it being a very clear day, I
fairly descried land, whether an island or continent I could not
tell; but it lay very high, extending from the West to the
IV. S. IV. at a very great distance; by my guess it could not be
less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, other-
wise than that I knew it must be part of America,- and, as I con-
cluded by all my observations, must be near the Spanirlx domi--
nions, and perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where if I should
have landed, I had been in a worse condition than I was now;
and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions of Providence,
which I began now to own, and to believe, ordered every thing
for the best; I say, I quieted my mind with this, and left
afflicting myself with fi'uitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some pause upon this affair, I considered, that if
this land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or
other, see some vessels pass or repass one way or other; but if
not, then it was the savage coast between the Spanish country
and Brmil, which are indeed the worst of :wage:; for they
are mnnibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to murder and devour
all the human bodies that fall into their hands.

With these considerations I walked very leisurely forward. I
found that side of the island where I now was, much pleasanter
than mine, the open or .mvanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers
and grass, and full of very fine woods. I saw abundance of
parrots, and fain would I have caught one, if possible, to have
kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to me. I did, after
some pains taken, catch a young parrot; for I knocked it down
with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home, but it
was some years before I could make him speak. However, at
last I taught him to call me by my name, very familiarly: but
the accident that followed, though it be a trifle, will be very
diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I found in the
low grounds, hares as I thought them to be, and foxes, but they
differed greatly from all the other kinds I had met with; nor
could I satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several: but
I had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of food, and
of that which was very good too: especially these three sorts,
viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle or tortoise; which, added to my
grapes, Laden/ml] market, could not have furnished a better table
than I, in proportion to the company: and though my case was
deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness, that I
was not driven to any extremities for food; but rather plenty,
even to dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a
day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns and returns, to
see what discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to
the place where I resolved to sit down for all night; and then
either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded myself with a row
of stakes set upright in the ground, either from one tree to ano-
ther, or soas no wild creature could come at me without waking
me.

As soon as 'I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that
I had taken up my lot on the worst side of the island; for here
indeed the shore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas
on the other side I had found but three in a year and a half.
Here was also an infinite number of fowls of many kinds, some
of which I had not seen before, and many of them very good
meat; but such as I knew not the names of,.except those called
penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing
of my powder and shot: and therefore had more mind to kill a
she--goat, if I could, which I could better feed on: and though
there were many more goats here than on the other side of the
island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them; the country being flat and even, and they saw me
much sooner than when I was on the hills.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than
mine, but yet I had not the least inclination to remove; for as I
was fixed in my habitation, it became natural to me; and I
seemed all the while I was here, to be, as it were, upon a journey,
and from home. However, I travelled along the shore of the sea
towards the cast, I suppose, about twelve miles; and then setting
up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I concluded I would
go home again; and the next journey I took should be on the
other side of the island, east from my dwelling, and so round,
till I came to my post again: of which in its place.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking
I could easily keep all the island so much in my view, that I
could not miss finding my first dwelling by viewing the country;
but I found myself mistaken; for being come about two or
three miles, I found myself descended into a very large valley;
but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with woods,
that I could not see which was my way by any direction but that
of the sun; nor even then, unless I knew very well the position
of the sun at that time of the day.

It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the weather proved
hazy for three or four days, while I was in this valley; and not
being able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably,
and at last was obliged to find out the sea--side, look for my post,
and come back the same way I went; and then by easy joumis
I turned homeward, the weather being exceeding hot; and my
gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other things, very heavy.

In this joumey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized
upon it; and I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved
it alive from the dog. I had a great mind to bring it home, if I
could; for I had often been musing whether it might not be
possible to get a kid or two, and so raise a breed of tame goats,
which might supply me when my powder and shot should be
spent.

I made a collar for this little creature; and with a string which
I made of some rope-yarn, which I always carried about me, I
led him along, though with some difiiculty, till I came to my
bower, and there I inclosed him, and left him; for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been absent above
a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into
my old hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed: this little
wandering journey, without a settled place of abode, had been so
unpleasant to me, that my own house, as I called it to myself,
was a perfect settlement to me, compared to that; and it ren-
dered every thing about me so comfortable, that I resolved I
would never go a great way from it again, while it should be my
lot to stay on the island.

I rcposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after
my long journey; during which, most of the time was taken up
in the weighty affair of making a cage for my Poll, who began
now to be a mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid, which I
had pent in within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch
it home, and give it some food: accordingly I went, and found
it where I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but was almost
starved for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees and
branches of such shrubs as I could find, and threw it over; and
having fed it, I tied it as I did before to lead it away; but it was
so me with being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it;
for it followed me like a dog; and as I continually fed it, the
creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it became
from that time one of my domestics also, and would never leave
me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and
I kept the 30th of September in the same solemn manner as
before, being the anniversary of my landing on the island, having
now been there two years, and no more prospect of being delivered
than the first day I came there. I spent the whole day in humble
and thankful acknowledgments of the many wonderful mercies
which my solitary condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave
humble and hearty thanks, that Goo had been pleased to discover
to me, even that it was possible I might be more happy in this
solitary condition, than I should have been in a liberty of society,
and in all the pleasures of the world: that he could fully make
up to me the deficiencies of my solitary state and the want of
human society, by his presence, and the communications of his
grace to my soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging me
to depend upon his providence here, and hope for his eternal
presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy
the life I now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than
the wicked cursed abominable life I led all the past part of my
days; and now, having changed both my sorrows and my joys,
my very desires altered, my affections changed their gust, and
my delights were perfectly new from what they were at first
coming, or indeed for two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting, or for view-
ing the country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would
break out upon me on a sudden, and my very heart would die
within me, to think of the woods, the mountains, the deserts I
was in; and how I was a prisoner, locked up with the eternal
bolts and bars of the ocean, in an uninhabited wilderness, without
redemption. In the midst of the greatest composures of my
mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and made me
wring my hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it would
take me in the middle of my work, and I would immediately sit
down and sigh, and look upon the ground for an hour or two
together; and this was still worse to me; for if I could burst
out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go off, and the
grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts; I
daily read the word of GOD, and applied all the comforts of it to
my present state. One morning, being very sad, I opened the
bible upon these words, " I will never, never leave flue, nor for-
sake thee! " Immediately it occurred, that these words were to
me, why else should they be directed in such a manner, Just at
the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of G00 and man? Well then, said I, if Goo does not
forsake me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it,
though the world should all forsake me; seeing on the other
hand, if I had all the world, and should lose the favour and
blessing of Goo, there would be no comparison in the loss.

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind, that it
was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary
condition, than it was probable I should ever have been in any
other particular state in the world; and with this thought I was
going to give thanks to GOD for bringing me to this place.

I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at
that thought, and I durst not speak the words. How unst thou
be such an hypocrite (said I, even audibly), to pretend to be
thankful for a condition, which, however thou mayest endeavour
to be" contented with, thou wouldest rather pray heartily to be
delivered from? So I stopped there; but though I could not
say I thanked GOD for being there,'yet I sincerely gave thanks
to Goo for opening my eyes, by whatever afflicting providences,
to see the former condition of my life, and to mourn for my
wickedness, and repent. I never opened the bible, or shut it,
but my very soul within me blessed Goo for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my
goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the
wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year;
and though I have not given the reader the trouble of so par-
ticular an account of my works this year as at the first, yet in
general it may be observed, that I was very seldom idle; having
regularly divided my time, according to the several daily employ-
ments that were before me; such as, first, my duty to Goo, and
reading the scriptures, which I constantly set apart some time
for, thrice every day. Second] , the going abroad with my gun
for food, which generally took me up three hours every morning
when it did not rain. Third! , the ordering, curing, preserving,
and cooking what I had killed or caught for my supply. These
took up great part of the day. Also it is to be considered, that
in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the
violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I could be supposed to
work in; with this exception, that sometimes I changed my
hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning,
and abroad with my gun in the aftemoon.

To this short time allowed for labour, I desire may be added
the exceeding laboriousnsss of my work; the many hours which,
for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, every thing
that I did took up out of my time: for example, I was full two-

1--
and-forty days making me a board for a long shelf, which I
wanted in my eave; whereas two sawyets, with their tools and
saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half
a day.

My case was this: It was to be a large tree which was to be
cut down, because my board was to be a broad one. The tree
I was three days a cutting down, and two more cutting of? the
. bouglis, and reducing it to a log, or piece of 'timber. With

inexpressible hacking and hewing, I reduced both the sides of it
into chips, till it began to be light enough to move; then I
turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat, as a board,
from end to end: then turning that side downward, cut the other
side till I brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and
smooth on both sides. Any one may judge the labour of my
hands in such a piece of work; but labour and patience carried
me through that and many other things; I only observe this in
particular, to shew the reason why so much of my time went
away with so little work, viz. That what might be a little to be
done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a pro-
digious time to do alone, and by hand.

But notwithstanding this, with patience and labour I went
through many things, and indeed every thing that my circum-
stances made necessary for me to do, as will appear by what
follows.

I was now in the months of November and December, expecting
my crop of barley and rice. The ground I had manured or dug
up for them was not great; for, as I observed, my seed of each
was not above the quantity of half a peck; for I had lost one
whole crop by sowing in the dry season; but now my crop
promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in danger
of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was
scarce possible to keep from it; at first, the goats, and wild
creatures which I called hares, which, tasting the sweetness of the
blade, lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and a: it
so close, that it could get no time to shoot up into stalks.

This I saw no remedy for, but by making an inclosure about
it with a hedge, which I did with a great deal of toil; and the
more, because it required a great deal of speed; the creatures
daily spoiling my corn. However, as my arable land was but
small, suited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced in about
three weeks time; and shooting some of the creatures in the day--
time, I set my dog to guard it in the night, tying him up to a
stake at the gate, where he would stand and bark all night long:
so in a little time the enemies forsook the place, and the corn
grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.

But as the beasts mined me before, while my corn was in the
blade, so the birds were as like to ruin me now, when it was in
the ear; for going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw
my little crop surrounded with fowls of I know not how many
sorts, which stood as it were watching till I should be gone. I
immediately let fly among them, (for I always had my gun with
me.) I had no sooner shot, but there arose up a little cloud of
fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn itself.

This touched me sensibly; for I foresaw, that in a few days
they would devour all my hopes: that I should be starved, and
never be able to raise a crop at all; and what to do I could not'
tell; however, I resolved not to lose my corn, if possible, though
I should watch it night and day. In the first place, I went among
it to see what damage was already done, and found they had
spoiled a good deal of it; but that, as it was yet too green for
them, the loss was not so great, but the remainder was like to be
a good crop, if it could be saved.

I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could
easily see the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if
they only waited till I was gone away, and the event proved it
tobeso; foraslwalkedofilasiflwas gone,lwas nosooner
out of their sight, but they dropped down one by one into the corn
again. I was so provoked, that I could not have patience to stay
till more came on, knowing that every grain that they eat now
was, a: it might be said, a peck leaf to me in the consequence;
but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed three of
them. This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and
served them as we serve notorious thieves in England, viz. hanged
them in chains, for a terror to others. It is impossible to imagine
almost, that this should have such an efi'ect as it had; for the
fowls would not only not come at the corn, but in short they
forsook all that part of the island, and I could never see a bird
near the place as long as my scarecrows hung there.

This I was very glad of, you may be sure; and about the
latter end of December, which was our second harvest of the year,
I reaped my com.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or a sickle to cut it down,
and all I could do was to make one as well as I could, out of one
of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms
out of the ship. However, as my crop was but small, I had no
great difficulty to cut it down: in short, I reaped it my way,
for I cut nothing of? but the ears, and carried it away in a great
basket which I had made, and so rubde it out with my hands:
and at the end of all my harvesting I found, that out of my half-
peck of seed, I had near two bushels of rice, and above two
bushels and a half of barley, that i: to my, by my guess, for I
had no measure at that time. .

However, this was a great encouragement to me; and I fore-
saw that in time it would please Goo to supply me with bread:
and yet here I was perplexed again; for I neither knew how to
grind or make meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it, and
part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread of it; and if
how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it. These things
being added to my desire of having a good quantity for store,
and to acme a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of
this crop, but to preserve it all for seed against the next season,
and in the mean time to employ all my study and hours of work--
ing to accomplish this great work of providing myself with corn
and bread.

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread. It is
a little wonderful, and what I believe few people have thought
much upon ;' 'viz. the strange multitude of little things necessary
in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and finish-
ing, this one article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a mere slate of nature, found this to be
my daily discouragement, and was made more and more sensible
of it every hour, even after I got the first handful of seed corn,
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade or shovel
to dig it. Well, this I conquered by making a wooden spade,
as I observed before, but this did my work in but a wooden
manner; and though it cost me a great many days to make it,
yet for want of iron, it not only wore out the sooner, but made
my work the harder, and made it be performed much wOrse.

However, this I bore with too, and was content to work it out
with patience, and bear with the badneas of the performance.
When the corn was sowed, I had no harrow, but was forced to go
over it myself, and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it,
to scratch- the earth, as it may be called, rather than rake or
harrow it.

When it was growing or grown, I have observed already how
many things Iwanted, to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it, cure
or carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it. Then
I wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dres it, yeast and salt to make
it into bread, and an oven to bake it in; and all these things I
did without, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was an
inestimable comfort and advantage to me too: but all this, as I
said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that there
was no help for; neither was my time so much loss to me, because
I had divided it. A certain part of it was every day appointed
to these works; and as I resolved to use none of the com for
bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had the next six
months to apply myself, wholly by labour and invention, to
fumish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the
operations necessary for the making the corn, when I had it, fit
for my use.

But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough
to sow above an acre of ground. Before I did this, I had a week's
work at least to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was
a very sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and required double
labour to work with it; however, I went through that, and sowed
my seeds in two large flat pieces of ground, as near my house as I
could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good hedge,
the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had set
before, which I knew would grow; so that in one year's time I
knew I should have a quick or living hedge, that would want but
little repair. This work was not so little as to take me up less
than three months ; because great part of that time was in the wet
season, when I could not go abroad.

Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could not go out, I
found employment on the following occasion, always observing,
that all the while I was at work, I diverted myself with talking to
my parrot, and teaching him to speak; and I quickly learnt him
to know his own name; at last, to speak it out pretty loud, Poll;
which was the first word I ever heard spoken in the island by any
mouth but my own. This therefore was not my work, but an
assistant to my work; for now, as I said, I had a-great employ--
ment upon my hands, as follows: viz. I had long studied, by
some means or other, to make myself some earthen vessels, which '
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them:
however, considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt
but if I could find out any such clay, I might botch up some
such pot, as might, being dried by the sun, be hard enough, and
strong enough, to bear handling, and to hold any thing that was
dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in
preparing corn, meal, 55:. which was the thing I was upon, I
resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand
like jars to hold what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to
tell how many awkward ways I took to raise this paste, what odd
misshapen ugly things I made, how many of them fell in, and
how many fell out, the clay not being stifi' enough to bear its
own weight; how many cracked by the over violent heat of the
sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell to pieces with
only removing, as well before as after they were dried; and, in
a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the clay, to dig
it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it, I could not make
above two large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them jars, in
about two months labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I
lifted them very gently up, and set them down again in two
greater wicker baskets, which I had made on purpose for them,
that they might not break; and, as between the pot and the
basket there was a little room to spare, I stufl'cd it full of the rice
and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand always dry,
I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal when
the corn we bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet
I made several smaller things with better success; such a little
round pots, flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my
hand turned to; and the heat of the sun baked them strangely hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an
earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none
of these could do. It happened after some time, making a pretty
large fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out after
I had done with it,I found a broken piece of one of my earthen-
ware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard as a stone, and red as a
tile. I was agreeably surprised to see it, and said to myself, that
certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they would burn
broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it
burn me some pots. I had no notion of a kiln, such as the pot-
ters burn in, or of glazing them with lead, though I had some
lead to do it with; but I placed three large pipkins, and two or
three pots, in a pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it, with a great heap of embers under them: I plied
the fire with fresh fuel round the outside, and upon the top, till
I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and observed
that they did not crack at all: when I saw them clear red, I let
them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand
which was mixed with the clay, melted by the violence of the
heat, and would have run into glass, if I had gone on; so I
slacked my fire gradually, till the pots began to abate of the red
colour; and watching them all night, that I might not let the
fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very good, I will
not say handsome pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as hard
burnt as could be desired ; and one of them perfectly glazed with
the running of the sand.

After this experiment I need not say that I wanted no sort of
earthen-ware for my use; but I must needs say, as to the shapes
of them, they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose,
when I had no way of making them, but as the children make
dirt-pies, or as a woman would make pies that never learnt to
raise paste.
Nojoy at a thingofso mean'anaturewasever equalto
mine, when I found I had made an earthen pot that would bear
the fire; and I had hardly patience to stay till they were cold,
before I set one upon the fire again, with some water in it, to
boil me some meat, which it did admirably well; and with a
piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I wanted

oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it so
good as I would have had it.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or
beat some corn in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of
arriving to that perfection of art with one pair of hands. To
supply this want, I was at a great loss; for of all trades in the
world I was as perfectly unqualified for a stone-cutter, as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it with. I spent
many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow,
and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what
was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out;
nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but
were all of a sandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear
the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without
filling it with sand; so, after a great deal of time lost in searching
for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great
block of hard wood, which I found indeed much easier; and
getting one as big as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and
formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet; and then,
with the help of fire and infinite labour, made a hollow place in
it, as the Indian: in Braril make their canon. After this, I made
a great heavy pestle or beater, of the wood called the iron-wood;
and this I prepared and laid by against I had my next cropof
corn, when I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my
corn or meal to make my bread.

My next difiiculty was to make a sieve or searce, to dress my
meal, and part it from the bran and the husk, without which I

r 2
did not see it possible I could have any bread. This was a most
difficult thing, so much as but to think on; for to be sure, I had
nothing like the necessary things to make it with; I mean fine
thin canvass, or stuff, to scarce the meal through. And here I
was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what
to do: linen I had none left but what was mere rags; I had
goat's hair, but neither knewI how to wave or spin it; and had
I known how, here were no tools to work it with. All the
remedy that I found for this, was, that at last I did remember I
had among the seamen's clothes, which were saved out of the
ship, some neckcloths of alico or muslin; and with some pieces
of these I made three small sieves, but proper enough for the
work: and thus I made shift for some years; how I did after-
wards, I shall shew in its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how
I should make bread when I came to have corn; for, first, I had
no yeast. As to that part, as there was no supplying the want, so
I did not concern myself much about it. But for an oven, I was
indeed in great pain. At length I found out an experiment for
that also, which was this: I made some earthen vessels very
broad, but not deep; that is to say, about two feet diameter, and
not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in the fire, as I had
done the other, and laid them by: and when I wanted to bake, I
made a great fire upon the hearth, which I had paved with some
square tiles of my own making and burning also; butI should
not call them square.

When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into embers or
live coals, I drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover
it all over; and there I let them lie, till the hearth was very hot:
then sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf, or loaves;
and whelming down the earthen pot upon them, drew the embers
all round the outside of the pot, to keep in, and add to the heat:
and thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I baked my
barley-loaves, and beeame in a little time a mere pastry--cook into
the bargain; for I made myself several cakes of the rice, and pud-
dings; indeed I made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into
them, supposing I had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.

It need not be wondered at, if all these things took me up
most part of the third year of my abode here; for it is to be ob-
served, that in the intervals of those things, I had my new harvest
and husbandry to manage: for I reaped my corn in its season,
and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the ear,
in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out; for I had no
floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash it with.

And now indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted
to build my barns bigger: I wanted a place to lay it up in; for
the increase of the corn now yielded me so much, that I had of
the barley about twenty bushels, and of the rice as much, or
more; insomuch that I now resolved to begin to use it freely,
for my bread had been quite gone a great while: also I resolved
to see what quantity would be sufiicient for me a whole year, and
to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and
rice were much more than I could consume in a year; so I
resolved to sow just the same quantity every year that I sowed
the last, in hopes that such a quantity would fully provide me
with bread, (it.

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had
seen from the other side of the island; and I was not without
secret wishes that I was on shore there, fancying that seeing the
main land, and in an inhabited country, I might find some way or
other to convey myself farther, and perhaps at last find some
means of eseape. .

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such
a condition, and how I might fall into the hands of savags, and
perhaps such as I might have reason to think far worse than the
lions and tigers of Africa : that if I once me into their power,
I should run a hazard more than a thousand to one of being
killed, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had heard that the
people of the Caribean coasts were cannibals, or men-eaters; and
I knew by the latitude that I could not be far of from that
shore: that, suppose they were not cannibals, yet they might kill
me, as many European: who had fallen into their hands had been
served, even when they had been ten or twenty together; much
more I that was but one, and could make little or no defence.
All these things, I say, which I ought to have considered well of,
and I did east up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took none of
my apprehensions at first; and my head ran mightily upon the
thoughts of getting over to that shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long boat with the
shoulder-of-mutton sail, with which I sailed above a thousand
miles on the coast of Africa,- but this was in vain. Then I
thought I would go and look on our ship's boat, which, as I have
said, was blown up upon the shore a great way in the storm,
when we were first cast away. She lay almost where she did at
first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves,
and the winds, almost bottom upwards, against the high ridge of
a beachy rough sand, but no water about her as before.

If I had hands to have refitted her, and have launched her into
the water, the boat would have done well enough, and I might
have gone back into the Brasil: with her easily enough; but I
might have easily foreseen, that I could no more turn her, and
set her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove the island.
However I went to the wood, and cut levers and rollers, and
brought them to the boat, resolving to try what I could do;

suggesting to myself, that if I could but turn her down, I might '
easily repair the damage she had received, and she would be a
very good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.
- 'I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent,
I think, three or four weeks about it: at last finding it impossible
to heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the
sand to undermine it; and so to make it fall down, setting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or
to get under it, much less to move it forwards towards the water;
soI was forced to give it over: and yet, though I gave over hopes
of the boat, my desire to venture over for the main increased,
rather than decreased, as the means for it seemed impossible.

This at length set me upon thinking whether it was not possible
to make myself a canoe or periagtm, such as the natives of those
climates make, even without tools, or as I might say, without
hands, viz. of the trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought
possible, but easy; and pleased myself extremely with my
thoughts of making it, and with my having much more con--
venience for it than any of the negrae: or Indian: ; but not at all
considering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more
than the Indian: did, <<#2. want of hands to move it into the
water, when it was made; a difficulty much harder for me to
surmount than all the consequences of want of tools could be to
them; for whatwas it to me, that when I had chosen a vast tree
in the woods, I might with great trouble cut it down, if, after I
might be able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into a
proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it
hollow, so to make a boat of it; if, after all this, I must leave it
just there where I found it, and was not able to launch it into the
water ?

One would have thought, I could not have had the least reflec-
tion upon my mind of my circumstances, while I was making my
boat, but I should have immediately thought how I should get
it into the sea ; but my thoughts were so intent upon my voyage
over the sea in it, that I never once considered how I should get
it off the land; and it was really in its own nature more easy for
me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea, than about forty~five
fathom of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever
man did, who had any of his senses awake. I pleased myself
with the design, without determining whether I was ever able to
undertake it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my own inquiries
into it by this foolish answer which I gave myself; Let me first
make it, I will warrant I will find some way or other to get it
along when it is done.

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of
my fancy prevailed, and to work I went, and felled a cedar tree;
I question much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the
building the temple of 7erusalem; it was five feet ten inches
diameter at the lower part next the stump, and four feet eleven
inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet, after which it
lessened for a while, and then parted into branches. It was not
without infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty days
hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more
getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head of it
cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with my axe and
hatchet, with inexpressible labour ; after this it cost me a month
to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to something like the
bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three months more to clear the inside, and work
it out so as to make an exact boat of it; this I did indeed without
fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour;
till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big
enough to have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently
big enough to have carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work, I was extremely delighted
with it: the boat was really much bigger than I ever saw acanae
6r periagua, that was made of one tree, in my life; many a weary
stroke it had cost, you may be sure, for there remained nothing
but to get it into the water; and hadI gotten it into the water, I
make no question but I should have begun the maddest voyage,
and the most unlikely to be performed, that ever was under-
taken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me, though
they cost infinite labour too; it lay about one hundred yards
from the water, and not more; but the first inconvenience was,
it was up hill towards the creek. Well, to take away this dis-
couragement, I resolved to dig into the surface of the earth, and
so make a declivity; this I began, and it cost me a prodigious
deal of pains : but who grudge pains that have their deliverance
in view? But when this was worked through, and this difiiculty
managed, it was still much at one; for I could no more stir the
canoe than I could the other boat.

Then I measured the distance of ground, and resolved to cut
a dock, or canal, to bring the water up to the canoe, seeing I
could not bring the tam: down to the water. Well, I began this
work, and when I began to enter into it, and calculated how deep
it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff to be thrown out, I
found that by the number of hands I had, being none but my
own, it must have been ten or twelve years before I should have
gone through with it; for the shore lay high, so that at the upper
end it must have been at least twenty feet deep; so at length,
though with great reluctancy, I gave this attempt over also.

This grieved me heartily ; and now I saw, though too late, the
folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before
we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this
place, and kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and
with as much comfort, as ever before; for by a constant study,
and serious application of the word of Goo, and by the assistance136 L!!! um Anni-runes

of his grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had
before ; I entertained different notions of things; I looked now
upon the world as a thing remote; which I had nothing to do
with, no expectation from, and indeed no desires about: in a
word,I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to
have; so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it
hereafter, e'x'z. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it;
and well I might say, as father Abra/mm to Dives, Between me
and thee there i: a great gulp/i fixed.

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of
the world here: I had neither the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eye, or the pride of [i e: I had nothing to covet, for I had all I
was now capable of enjoying: I was lord of the whole manor;
or, if I pleased, I might call myself king or emperor over the
whole country which I had possession of: there were no rivals:
I had no competitor, none to dispute sovereignty or command
with me; I might have raised ship-loadings of corn, but I had
no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for my
occasion: I had tortoises, or turtles enough; but now and then
one was as much as I could put to any use: I had timber enough
to have built a fleet of ships; I had grapes enough to have made
wine, or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when
they had been built.

But all I could make use of, was all that was valuable: I had
enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what was all the
rest to me? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must
eat it, or the vermin; if I sowed more com than I could eat, it
must be spoiled: the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on
the ground, I could make no more use of them than for fuel;
and that I had no occasion for, but to dress my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me,
upon just reflection, that all the good things of this world are no
farther good to us than as they are for our use: and that what-. "VI-{'7' - '

or Roamso'n Causoa. I37

ever we may heap up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much
as we ean use, and no more. The most covetous griping miser
in the world would have been cured of the vice of eovetousness,
if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more than I
knew what to do with. I had no room for desire, except it was
of things which I had not, and they were but trifles, though
indeed of great use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a parcel
of money, as well gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling;
alas! there the nasty, sorry, useless stufi' lay; I had no manner
of business for it; and I often thought with myself, thatI would
have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes, or for a
hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given it all for
six-penny worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England, or for
a handful of pea: and beam, and a bottle of ink: 451'! war, I
had not the least advantage by it, or benefit from it; but there
it lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the eave
in the wet season; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds,
it had been the same case; and they had been of no manner of
value to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself
than it was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to
my body. I frequently sat down to my meat with thankfulneas,
and admired the hand of Goo's providence, which had thus spread
my table in the wildemeas. I learned to look more upon the
bright side of my condition, and less upon the dark side; and
to consider what I enjoyed, rather than what I wanted; and this
gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I eannot express
them; and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented
people in mind of it, who eannot enjoy comfortably what Goo
has given them, beeause they see and covet something that he
has not given them: all our discontents about what we want ap-

peared to me to spring from the want of thankfulneas for what
we have.
Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would
be so to any one that should fall into such distress as mine was;
and this was, to compare my present condition with what I at
first expected it should be; nay, with what it would certainly
have been, if the good providence of GOD had not wonderfully
ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the shore, where I not only
could come at her, but could bring what I got out of her to the
shore for my relief and comfort; without which I had wanted
tools to work, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and shot for
getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to
myself in the most lively colours how I must have acted, if I had
got nothing out of the ship; how I could not have so much as
got any food, except fish and turtles; and that, as it was long
before I found any of them, I must have perished first: that I
should have lived, if I had not perished, like a mere savage: that
if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any contrivance, I had no way
to slay or open them, or part the flesh from the skin and the
bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and
pull it with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of
Providence to me, and very thankful for my present condition,
with all its hardships and misfortunes: and this part also I can--
not but recommend to the reflection of those who are apt in their
misery to say, 1: any afiitlion like mine? Let them consider,
how much worse the cases of some people are, and what their
case might have been, if Providence had thought fit.

I had another reflection which assisted me also to comfort my
mind with hopes; and this was, comparing my present condition
with what I had deserved, and had therefore reason to expect
from the hand of Providence; I had lived a dreadful life, per-
fectly destitute of the knowledge and fear of Goo: I had been
well instructed by my father and mother; neither had they been
wanting to me in their early endeavours, to infuse a religious awe
of Goo into my mind,'a sense of my duty, and of what the nature
and end of my being required of me. But, alas! falling early
into the sea-faring life, which of all the lives is the most destitute
of the fear of Goo, though his terrors are always before them;
'I say, falling early into the seafaring life, and into seafaring com--
pany, all that little sense of religion which I had entertained, was
laughed out of me by my messmates; by a hardened despising
of dangers, and the views of death, which grew habitual to me;
by my long absence from all manner of opportunities to converse
with any thing but what was like myself, or to hear any thing of
what was good, or tended towards it.

So void was I of every thing that was good, or of the least
sense of what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest deliverances
I enjoyed, such as my escape from Seller, my being taken up by
the Portuguue master of the ship, my being planted sowell in
Brasil, my receiving the eargo from England, and the like, I
never once had the words Thank God, so much as on my mind,
or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress, had I so much
thought as to pray to him; nor so much as to say, Lord, Iurue
mercy upon me! No, nor to mention the name of GOD, unless it
was to swear by, and blaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I
have already observed, on the account of my wicked and hardened
life past; and when I looked about me, and considered what
particular providences had attended me, since my coming into
this place, and how Goo had dealt bountifully with me; had
not only punished me less than my iniquity deserved, but had so
plentifully provided for me; this gave me great hopes that my
repentance was accepted, and that Goo had yet mercies in 'store
for me.

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to
resignation to the will of Goo in the present disposition of my
circumstances, but even to a sincere thankfulness for my condi-
tion; and that I, who was yet a living man, ought not to com--
plain, seeing I had not the due punishment of my sins; that I
enjoyed so many mercies, which I had no reason to have ex-
pected in that place; that I ought never more to repine at my
condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily
bread which nothing but a cloud of wonders could have brought:
that I ought to consider I had been fed even by a miracle, even
as great as that of feeding Elija by ravens; nay, by a long series
of miracles; and that I could hardly have named a place in the
uninhabited part of the world, where I could have been cast
more to my advantage: a place where, as I had no society,
which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no ravenous
beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no veno-
mous creatures, or poisonous, which I might have fed on to my
hurt; no savages to murder and devour me.

In a word, as my life was a life of sorrow one way, so it was
a life of mercy another: and I wanted nothing to make it a life
of comfort, but to be able to make my sense of GOD'S goodness
to me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily consola-
tion; and after I did make a just improvement of these things, I
went away, and was no more sad.

I had now been here so long, that'many things which I brought
on shore for my help, were either quite gone, or very much
wasted, and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone for some time, all but
a very little, which I eked out with water a little and a little, till
it was so pale it scarce left any appearance of black upon the
paper: as long as it lasted, I made use of it to minute down the
days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to
me; and first, by casting up times past, I remembered that there
was a strange concurrence of days, in the various providencee which

befel me, and which, if I had been superstitiously inclined to
observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had (reason to
have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

. First, I had observed, that the same day that I broke away
fiom my father and my friends, and ran away to Hull in order to
go to sea, the same day afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man
of war, and made a slave.

The same day of the year that I eseaped out of the wreck of
that ship in format}: Roads, that same day of the year after-
wards I made my eseape from Sallee in the boat.

The same day of the year I was born on, viz. the 20th of
September, the same day I had my life so miraculously saved 26
years after, when I was cast on shore in this island; so that my
wicked life, and solitary life, both began on a day.

The next thing to my ink's being wasted, was that of my
bread, I mean the biscuit which I brought out of the ship. This
I had husbanded to the last degree, allowing myself but one cake
of bread a day, for above a year: and yet I was quite without
bread for near a year before I got any corn of my own; and great
reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the getting it
being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to linen, I had
had none a good while, except some chequered shirts which I found
in the chests of the other seanien, and which I carefully preserved,
because many times I could bear no other clothes on but a shirt;
and it was a very great help to me, that I had among all the
men's clothes of the ship almost three dozen of shirts. There
were also several thick watch--coats of the seamen's, which were
left indeed, but they were too hot to wear; and though it is true,
that the weather was so violent hot that there was no need of
clothes, yet I could not go quite naked; no, though I had been
inclined to it, which I was not ; nor could I abide the thoughts
of it, though I was all alone.

- One reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not
bear the heat of the sun so well when quite naked, as with some
clothes on; nay, the very heat frequently blistered my skin;
whereas, with a shirt on, the air itself made some motion, and
whistling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without it:
no more could I ever bring myself to go out in the heat of the
sun without a cap or a hat; the heat of the sun beating with
such violence as it does in that place, would give me the head-
ach presently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap
or hat on, so that I could not bear it; whereas, if! put on my
hat, it would presently go away.

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few
rags I had, which I called clothes, into some order; I had worn
out all the waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try ifI
could not make jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had
by me, and with such other materials as I had; so I set to work
a-tailoring, or rather indeed a-botching; for I made most piteous
work of it. However, I made shift to make two or three waist--
coats, which I hoped would serve me a great while; as for
breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures
that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and I had hung them
up stretched out with sticks in the sun; by which means some
of them were so dry and hard, that they were fit for little; but
others, it seems, were very useful. The first thing I made of
these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the outside
to shoot ofl' the rain; and this I performed so well, that after
thisI made a suit of clothes wholly of those skins; that is to
say, a waistcoat and breeches open at the knees, and both loose;
for they were rather wanted to keep me cool, than to keep me
warm. I must not omit to acknowledge, that they were wretch-
edly made; for if I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor:
however, they were such as I made very good shift with; and
when I was abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the waist-
coat and cap being outmost, I was kept very dry.

After this I spent a deal of time and pains to make me an
umbrella: I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great
mind to make one; I had seen them made in the Brarik, where
they are very useful in the great heats which are there; and I
felt the heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being
nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be much abroad,
it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as the
heats. I took a world of pains at it, and was a great while be-
fore I_could make any thing likely to hold; nay, afterI thought
I had hit the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to
my mind; but at last I made one that answered indifferently well;
the main difficulty I found was to make it to let down. Icould
make it to spread; but if it did not let down too, and draw in,
it would not be portable for me any way, but just over my head,
which would not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one
to answer; I covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it
cast off the rain like a pent--house, and kept of!" the sun so efl'ec-
tually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather, with
greater advantage than I could before in the coolest; and when
I had no need of it, I could close it, and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably. my mind being entirely
composed by resigning to the will of Goo, and throwing myself
wholly upon the disposal of his Providence: this made my life
better than sociable; for when I began to regret the want of
conversation, I would ask myself, whether thus conversing mu-
tually with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, I may say, with
even Goo himself, by ejaculations, was not better than the utmost
enjoyment of human society in the world?

I cannot say, that after this, for five years, any extraordinary
thing happened to me; but I lived on in the same course, in the
same posture and placejust as before; the chiefthingI was
employed in, besides my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always kept upjust
enough to have sufficient stock of the year's provision: before-
hand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my daily labour of
going out with my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe,
which at last I finished: so that by digging a canal to it, six feet
wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half
a mile. As for the first, that was so vastly big, as I made it with-
out considering beforehand, as I ought to do, how I should be
able to launch it ; so never being able to bring it to the water, or
bring the water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was, as
a memommimn to teach me to be wiser next time. Indeed the
next time though Icould not get a tree proper for it, and was
in a place where I could not get the water to it, at any less dis-
tance than, as I have said, of near halt. a mile; yet as I saw it
was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and though I was
near two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in hopes
of having a boat to go or? to sea at last.

However, though my little prriugmz was finished, yet the size
of it was not at all answerable to the design which I had in view,
when I made the first; I mean of venturing over to the firm
firma, where it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
smallness of my boat assisted to put an end to that design, and
now I thought no more of it. But as I had a boat, my next
design was to make a tour round the island; for as I had been
on the other side, in one place, crossing, as I have already de-
scribed it, over the land, so the discoveries I made in that joumey,
made me very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I
had a boat, I thought of nothing but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, and that I might do every thing with dis-
cretion and consideration, I fitted up a little mast to my boat,
and made a sail to it out of some of the pieces of the ship's sails,
which lay in store, and of which I had a great store by me.

Having fitted my mast and sail, and tried the boat, I found
she would sail very well. Then I made little lockers and boxes
at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries, and am-
munition, fit. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or the spray
of the sea; and a little long hollow place I cut in the inside of
the boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down
over it to keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella also in a step at the stern, like a mast, to
stand over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like
an awning; and thus I every now and then took a little voyage
upon the sea, but never went far out, nor far from the little
creek; but at last, being eager to view the circumference of my
little kingdom, I resolved upon my tour, and accordingly I
victualled my ship for the voyage; putting in two dozen of my
loaves (cakes I should rather call them) of barley-bread; an
earthen pot full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal of ; a
little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder with shot for killing
more, and two large watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned
before, I had saved out of the seamen's chests; these I took, one
to lie upon, and the other to cover me in the night.

It was the sixth of November, in the sixth year of my reign,
or my captivity, which you please, that I set out on this voyage,
and I found it much longer than I expected: for though the
island itself was not very large, yet when I came to the east side
of it, I found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the sea, some above water, some under it; and beyond this
a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more; so that I was
obliged to go a great way out to sea to double that point.

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my
enterprize, and come back again, not knowing how far it might
oblige me to go out to sea, and above all, doubting how I should
get back again; so I came to an anchor, for I had made me a
kind of an anchor, with a piece of broken grappling which I got
out of the ship.

a
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and went on shore,
climbing up a hill, which seemed to overlook that point, where
I saw the full extent of it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I per-
ceived a strong, and indeed, a most furious current, which ran to
the east, and even came close to the point; andI took the more no-
tice of it, because I saw there might be some danger, that when
I came into it, I might be carried out to sea by the strength of
it, and not be able to make the island again. And indeed, had
I not gotten first upon this hill,I believe it would have been so;
for there was the same current on the other side of the island,
only that it set it off at a farther distance; and I saw there was
a strong eddy under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to
get out of the first current, and I should presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days; because the wind blowing
pretty fresh (E. a! S. E. and that being just contrary to the said
current) made a great breach of the sea upon the point; so that
it was not safe for me to keep too close to the shore for the
breach, nor to go too far ofl" because of the stream.

The third day in the morning, the wind having abated over
night, the sea was calm, and I ventured; but I am a warning-
piece again to all rash and ignorant pilots; for no sooner was I
come to the point, when I was not my boat's length from the
shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water, and a current
like the sluice of a mill. It carried my boat along with it with
such violence, that all I could do could not keep her so much as
on the edge of it: but I found it hurried me farther and farther
' out from the eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no
wind stirring to help me, and all that I could do with my paddles
signified nothing: and now I began to give myself over for lost;
for, as the current was on both sides the island, I knew in a
few leagues distance they must join again, and then I was irre-
coverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding it: so
that I had no prospect before me but of perishing; not by the
sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for hunger. I
had indeed found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could
lift, and had tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of
fresh water, that is to say, one of my earthen pots; but what was
all this to being driven into the vast ocean, where, to be sure,
there was no shore, no main land or island, for a thousand leagues
at least!

And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of Goa to
make the most miserable condition that mankind could be in
worn. Now I looked back upon my desolate solitary island, as
the most pleasant place in the world, and all the happiness my
heart could wish for, was to be there again. I stretched out my
hands to it with eagerwishes ; 0 happy desert, said I, I shall never
see thee more ! O miserable creature! said I, whither am I going?
Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and how
I had repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I
give to be on shore there again ! Thus we never see the true state
of our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor
know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is
scarce possible to imagine the consternation I was now in, being
driven from my beloved island (for so it appeared to me now to
be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in the utmost
despair of ever recovering it again: however, I worked hard, till
indeed my strength Was almost exhausted; and kept my boat as
much to the northward, that is, towards the side of the current
which the eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as
the sun passed the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind
in my face, springing up from the S. S. E. This cheered my
heart a little, and especially when in about half an hour more, it
blew a pretty small gentle gale. By this time I was gotten at a
frightful distance from the island; and, had the least cloud or
hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way too;
for I had no compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if I had but once lost
sight of it; but the weather continuing clear, I applied myself to
get up my mast again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north as much as possible, to get out of the current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to
stretch away, I saw even by the clearness of the water, some
alteration of the current was near; for where the current was so
strong, the water was foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to the cart, at
about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some rocks; these
rocks I found caused the current to part again ; and as the main
stress of it ran away more soul/xerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rock, and
made a strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west with
a very sharp stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them
upon the ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to
murder them, or who have been in such like extremities, may
guess what my present surprise of joy was, and how gladly I put
my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the wind also freshen-
ing, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running cheerfully before
the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy under foot.

This eddy carried me about a league in my way back again
directly towards the island, but about two leagues more towards
the northward than the current lay, which carried me away at
first; so that when I came near the island, I found myself open
to the northern shore of it, that is to say, the other end of the
island, opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way by
the help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served
me no farther. However, I found, that being between the two
great currents, viz. that on the south side which had hurried me
away, and that on the north, which lay about two leagues on the
other side; I say, between these two, in the west of the island, I
found the water at least still, and running no way; and having
still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for
the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.

About four o'clock in the evening, being then within about a
league of the island, I found the point of the rocks which occa-
sioned this distance, stretching out as is described before, to the
southward, and tasting of the current more southerly, had of
course made another eddy to the north; and this I found very
strong, but not directly setting the way my course lay, which was
due west, but almost full north. However, having a fresh gale,
I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west, and in about an
hour came within about a mile of the shore: it being smooth
water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, I fell on my knees, and gave Goo
thanks for my deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of
my deliverance by my boat; and refreshing myself with such
things as I had, I brought my boat close to the shore, in a little
cove that I had cspied under some trees, and laid me down to
sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue of the
voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my
boat; I had run so much hazard, and knew too much the case,
to think of attempting it by the way I went out; and what
might be at the other side (I mean the west side) I knew not,
nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I only
resolved in the morning to make my way westward along the
shore, and to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my
frigate in safety, so as to have her again if I wanted her. In
about three miles, or thereaboues, coasting the shore, I came to
a very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till
it me to a very little rivulet, or brook, where I found a con-
venient harbour for my boat, and where she lay as if she had been
in a little dock made on purpose for her: here I put in, and
having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to look about
me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I
had been before when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking
nothing out of my boat but my gun and my umbrella, for it was
exceeding hot, I began my march: the way was comfortable
enough after such a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found every thing standing
as I left it; for I always kept it in good order, being, as I said
before, my country-house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest
my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep: but judge you,
if you can, that read my story, what a surprise I must be in,
when I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by
my name several times, Rooirt, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin
Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you?
Where have you been?

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or
paddling, as it is called, the first part of the day, and walking the
latter part, that I did not awake thoroughly; and dozing between
sleeping and waking, thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to
me: but as the voice continued to repeat Robin Crusoe, Robin
Crusoe, at last I began to awake more perfectly, and was at first
dreadfully frighted, and started up in the utmost consternation:
but no sooner were my eyes open, but I saw my Poll sitting on
the top of the hedge, and immediately knew that this was he
that spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning language I had
used to talk to him, and teach him; and he had learned it so
perfectly, that he would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill clwe
to my face, and cry, Poor Robin Crusoe, Where are you .9

Where 1147:! you been .9 How come you here ?-- and such things as
I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that
indeed it could be nobody else, it was a good while before I could
compose myself. First, I was amazed how the creature got
thither, and then how he should just keep about the place, and
no where else: but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but
honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my hand, and ealling
him by his name, Poll, the sociable creature came to me, and sat
upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me,
Poor Robin Crusoe, and how did I come lure ? and when had I
been? just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and so
I carried him home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and
had enough to do for many days to sit still, and reflect upon the
danger I had been in. I would have been very glad to have
had my boat again on my side of the island, butI knew not how
it was practicable to get it about. As to the east-side of the
island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there was
no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my
very blood run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of
the island, I did not know how it might be there; but supposing
the current ran with the same force against the shore at the east,
as it passed by it on the other, I might run the same risk of being
driven down the stream, and earried by the island, asI had been
before of being carried away from it: so with these thoughts I
contented myself to be without any boat, though it had been the
product of so many months labour to make it, and of so many
more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a. year, lived
a very sedate retired life, as you may well suppose; and my
thoughts being very much composed, as to my condition, and
fully comforted in resigning myself to the dispensations of Provi-
dence, I thought I lived really very happily in all things except
that of society.
I improved myself, in this time, in all the mechanic exercises
which my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and I
believe could, upon occasion, have made a very good carpenter,
especially considering how few tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my
earthen-ware, and contrived well enough to make them with a
wheel, which I found infinitely easier and better, because I made
things round and shapeable, which before were filthy things
indeed to look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I found out, than
for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it was a
very ugly clumsy thing when it was done, and only burnt red
like other earthen--ware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would
draw the smoke, I was exceedingly comforted with it; for I had
been always used to smoke, and there were pipes in the ship, but
I forgot them at first, not knowing there was tobacco in the
island; and afterwards when I searched the ship again, I could
not come at any pipes at all.

In my wicker-ware I also improved much, and made abun-
dance of necessary baskets, as well as my invention shewed me,
though not very handsome, yet convenient for my laying things
up in, or fetching things home in. For example, if I killed a
goat abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and dress it, and
cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a basket; and the like by
a turtle: I could cut it up, take out the eggs, and a piece or two
of the flesh, which was enough for me, and bring them home in
a basket, and leave the rest behind me: also large deep baskets
were my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out as soon
as it was dry, and cured; and kept it in great baskets instead of
a granary.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; and
this was a want which it was impossible for me to supply: then
I began seriously to consider what I must do when I should have
no more powder; thatis to say,howIshoulddotokillany
goats. I had, as I observed, in the third year of my being here,
kept a young kid, and bred her tame; I was in hopes of getting
a he--kid, but I could not by any means bring it to pass, till my
kid grew an old goat; and I could never find in my heart to kill
her, till she died at last of mere age.

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I
have said, my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study
some art to trap and snare the goats, to see whether I could not
catch some of them alive; and particularly I wanted a she-goat
great with young.

To this purpose I made snares to hamper them; and believe
they were more than once taken in them; but my tackle was not
good, for I had no wire, and always found them broken, and my
bait devoured.

At length I resolved to try a pit--fall; so I dug several large
pits in the earth, in places where I had observed the goats used
to feed, and over those pits I placed hurdles of my own making
too, with a great weight upon them ; and several times I put ears
of barley, and dry rice, without setting the trap; and I could
easily perceive that the goats had gone in, and eaten up the corn,
for I could see the mark of their feet : at length, I set three traps
in one night, and gOing the next morning, I found them all stand-
ing, and yet the bait eaten and gone. This was very discouraging ;
however, I altered my trap; and, not to trouble you with par-
ticulars, going one morning to see my traps, I found in one of
them a large old he-goat; and, in one of the others, three kids,
a male and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was
so fierce I durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to go
about to bring him away alive, which was what I wanted; I
could have killed him, but that was not my. business, nor would
it answer my end; so I e'en let him out, and he ran away as if

c 2
he had been frightened out of his wits; but I did not then know
what I afterwards learned, that hunger would tame a lion: if I
had let him stay there three or four days without food, and then
have carried him some water to drink, and then a little corn, he
would have been as name as one of the kids; for they are mighty
sagacious, tractable creatures, where they are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at
that time; then I went to the three kids; and taking them one
by one, I tied them with strings together; and with some diffi-
culty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing
them some sweet corn, it tempted them, and they began to be
tame: and now I found that if I expected to supply myself with
goat's-flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some
up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have them
about my house like a flock of sheep.

But then it presently occurred to me, that I must keep the
tame from the wild, or else they would always run wild when
they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some
inclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale,
to keep them in so efi'ectually, that those within might not break
out, or those without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands; yet as I
saw there was an absolute necessity of doing it, my first piece of
work was to find out a proper piece of ground; 'viz. where there
was likely to be herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink,
and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such enclosures, will think I had very
little contrivance, when I pitched upon a place very proper forall
these, being a plain open piece of meadow-land, or savanna (as
our people call it in the western colonies) which had two or
three little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was very

Wdegoody , I say they will smile at my forecast, when I shall tell
diemlbeganmyenclosingofthispieceofgroundinsuch a
manner, that my hedge, or pale, must have been at least two miles
about; nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass; for
if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it
in ; but I did not consider, that my goats would be as wild in so
much compass, as if they had had the whole island; and I should

have so much room to chase them in, that I should never catch
them.

My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, about fifty
yards, when this thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped
short, and for the first beginning I resolved to enclose a piece of
about 150 yards in length, and 100 yards in breadth, which as
it would maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable
time, so, as my flock increased, I could add more ground to my
enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with
courage. I was about three months hedging in the first piece;
and, till I had done it, I tethered the three kids in the best part
of it, and used them to feed as near me as possible, to make
them familiar; and very often I would go and carry them some
cars of barley, or a handful of rice, and feed them out of my
hand; so that after my enclosure was ,finished, and I let them
loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for
a handful of corn.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had
a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years
more I had three-and--forty, besides several that I took and killed
for my food; and after that I enclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive them into, to
take them as I wanted them; and gates out of one piece of
ground.into another.

But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's-flesh to
feed on when I pleased, but milk too, a thing which indeed in
my beginning I did not so much as think of, and which, when
it came into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise; for
now I set up my dairy, and had sometimes a gallon or two of
milk in a day. And as Nature, who gives supplies of food to
every creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it, so
I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen butter or
cheese made, very readily and handily, though after a great many
essays and miscarriages, made me both butter and cheese at last,
and never wanted it afterwards.

How mercifully can our great Creator treat his creatures, even
in those conditions in which they seemed to be overwhelmed in
destruction ! How can he sweeten the bitterest providences, and
give us cause to praise him for dungeons and prisons! What a
table was here spread for me in a wilderness, where I saw nothing
at first but to perish for hunger!

It would have made a stoic smile, to have seen me and my little
family sit down to d1nner: there was my majesty, the prince and
lord of the whole island; I had the lives of all my subjects at
absolute command; I could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it
away, and no rebels among all my subjects!

Then to see how like a king I dined too, all alone, attended
by my servants ! Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me; my dog, which was now
grown old and crazy, and found no species to multiply his kind
upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side
the table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit

from my hand, as a mark of special favour. '
But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at

first; for they were both of them dead, and had been interred
nw my habitation by my own hands; but one of them having
multiplied by I know not what kind of creature, these were two
which I preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild into the woods,
and became indeed troublesome to me at last; for they would
often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I was
obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they
left me with this attendance, and in this plentiful manner I lived;
neither could I be said to want any thing but society, and of that,
in some time after this, I was like to have too much.

I was something impatient, u I have observed, to have the use
of my boat, though very loth to run any more hazard: and
therefore sometimes I eat conniving ways to get her about the
island, and at other times I sat myself down contented enough
without her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind to go
down to the point of the island, where, as I have said in my last
ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay, and how the
current set, that I might see what I had to do: this inclination
increased upon me every day; and at length I resolved to travel
thither by land, and following the edge of the shore, I did so:
but had any one in England been to meet such a man as I was,
it must either have frighted them, or raised a great deal of laugh-
ter; and as I frequently stood still to look at myself,I could not
but smile at the notion of my travelling through Yorkshire with
such an equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take a
sketch of my figure, as follows:

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of goat's-skin, with a
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me, as
to shoot the rain of? from running into my neck ; nothing being
so hurtful in these climates, as the rain upon the flesh under the
clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat's-skin, the skirts coming down to
about the middle of my thighs: and a pair of open-kneed
breeches of the same: the breeches were made of the skin of an
old Ire-goat, whose hair hung down such a length on either side,
that, like pantalowu, it reached to the middle of my legs. Stock-
ings and shoes I had none; but I made me a pair ofsomething,
I searoe know what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my
legs, and lace on either .side like spatterdashes; but of a most
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.
I had on a broad belt of goat's-skin dried, which I drew
together with two thongs of the same, instead of buckles; and
in a kind of frog on either side of this, instead of a sword and
dagger, hung a little saw and hatchet; one on one side, one on
the other: I had another belt not so broad, and fastened in the
same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at the end of
it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of goat's-
skin too; in one of which hung my powder, in the other my
shot: at my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun,
and over my head a great clumsy ugly goat's--skin umbrella, but
which, after all, was the most necessary thingI had about me,
next to my gun: as for my face, the colour of it was really not
so A/Iulxztta like, as one might expect from a man not at PS1 care-
ful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of the equinax.
My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was about a quarter
of a yard long ; but as I had both scissars and razors sufficient,
I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip,
which I had trimmed into a large pair of Maliametan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some "Turk: whom I saw at Sal/er:
for the .l/loor: did not wear such, though the Turk: did. Of these
mustachios, or whiskers, I will not say they were long enough to
hang my hat upon them; but they were of length and shape
monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed
for frightful.

But all this is by the bye; for as to my figure, I had so few to
observe me, that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say
no more to that part: in this kind of figure I went my new
joumey, and was out five or six days. I travelled first along the
sea-shore, directly to the place where I first brought my boat to
an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having no boat now
to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way, to the same
height that I was upon before; when looking forward to the point
of the rock which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with
my boat, as I said above, I was surprised to see the set. all smooth
and quiet; no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there
than in other places.

I was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to
spend some time in the observing of it, to see if nothing from
the sets of the tide had occasioned it; but I was presently con--
vinced how it was; 'viz. that the tide of ebb setting from the
west, and joining with the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the oceasion of this current; and that
according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west, or from
the north, this current came nearer, or went farther from the shore ;
for, waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again,
and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current
again as before, only that it ran farther ofi', being near half a
league from the shore; whereas in my ease, it set close upon the
shore, and hurried me and my came along with it, which at
another time it would not have done.

This observation convinced me, that I had nothing to do but
to observe the ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might
very easily bring my boat about the island again: but when I
began to think of putting it in practice, I had such a terror upon
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I had been in, that
I could not think of it again with any patience; but on the con-
trary, I took up another resolution, which was more safe, though
more laborious; and this was, that I would build, or rather make
me another periagua, or canoe ; and so have one for one side of
the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand, that now I had, as I may all it, two
plantations in the island; one my little fortification or tent, with
the wall about it under the rock, with the cave behind me, which
by this time I had enlarged into several apartments or caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the driest and largest,
and had a door yet beyond my wall or fortifieation, that is to
say, beyond where my wall joined to the rock, was all filled up
with large earthen pots, of which I have given an account, and
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold five or
six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of provision, espe-
cially my corn, some in the ear cut oil" short from the straw, and
the other rubbed out with my hands.

As for my wall, made a: before, with long stakes or piles,
those piles grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so
big, and spread so very much, that there was not the least appear-
ance, to any one's view, of any habitation behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land,
and upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn ground;
which I kept duly cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded
me their harvest in its season; and whenever I had occasion for
more com, I had more land adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country-seat, and I had now a tolerable
plantation there also; for first, I had my little bower, as I called
it, which I kept in repair; that i: to my, I kept the hedge which
circled it in, constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder
standing always in the inside: I kept the trees, which at first
were no more than my stakes, but were now grown very firm
and tall ; I kept them always so cut, that they might spread and
grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which
they did effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had
my tent always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over
poles set up for that purpose, and which never wanted any repair
or renewing; and under this I had made me a squab or couch,
with the skins of the creatures I had killed, and with other soft
things, and a blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-
bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-coat to cover me;
and here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief
seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to
say, my goats: and as I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains
to fence and enclose this ground, I was so uneasy to see it kept
entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left 06',
till with infinite labour I had stuck the outside of the hedge so
full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather
a pale than a hedge, and there was searce room to put a hand
through between them, which afterwards, when those stakes grew,
as they all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure
strong, like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared
no pains to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my
comfortable support; for I considered the keeping up a breed of
lame creatures thus at my hand, would be a living magazine of
flesh, milk, butter, and cheese, for me, as long as I lived in the
place, if it were to be forty years; and that keeping them in my
reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my enclosures to
such a degree that I might be sure of keeping them together;
which by this method indeed I so effectually secured, that when
these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very
thick, I was forced to pull some of them up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally
depended on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never
failed to preserve very earefully, as the best, and most agreeable
dainty of my whole diet; and indeed they were not only agree-
able, but physieal, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing to the
last degree.

As this was also about half way between my other habitation
and the place where I had laid up my boat, I generally staid and
lay here in my way thither; for I used frequently to visit my
boat, and I kept all things about or belonging to her in very
good order: sometimes I went out in her to divert myself, but
no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor scarce ever above a
stone's east or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of{him/w- 131' m 524,}- Big: [52 '
thing contrary to the nature of such things, and especially to the
usual practice of all creatures in fear. But I was so embarrassed

with my own frightful ideas of the thing, that I formed nothing
but dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was now a
great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil;
and reason joined in with me upon this supposition. For how
should any other thing in human shape come into the place?
Where was the vessel that brought them? What marks were
there of any other footsteps? And how was it possible a man
should come there? But then to think that Satan should take
human shape upon him in such a place, where there could be no
manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot
behind him, and that even for no purpose too (for he could not
be sure I should see it), this was an amazement the other way.
I considered that the devil might have found out abundance of
other ways to have terrified me, than this of the single print of
a foot. That as I lived quite on the other side of the island, he
would never have been so simple to leave a mark in a place
where it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever see it or
not; and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea upon
a high wind would have defaced entirely. All this seemed in-
consistent with the thing itself, and with all notions we usually
entertain of the subtlety of the devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of
all apprehensions of its being the devil. And I presently com
cluded that it must be some more dangerous creature; viz. That
it must be some of the savages of the main land over against me,
who had wandered out to sea in their canoes, and, either driven
by the currents, or by contrary winds, had made the island; and
had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea, being as
loth, perhaps, to have staid in this desolate island, as I would
have been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling upon my mind, I was very
thankful in my thought, that I was so happy as not to be there-
abouts at that time, or that they did not see my boat, by which
they would have concluded, that some inhabitants had been in
the place, and perhaps have searched farther for me. Then ter-
rible thoughts racked my imaginations about their having found
my boat, and that there were people here; and that if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater numbers, and
devour me; that if it should happen so that they should not find
me, yet they would find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, carry
away all my flock of tame goats, and I should perish at last for
mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope : all that former
confidence in G01) which was founded upon such wonderful ex-
perience as I had had of his goodness, now vanished; as if he
that had fed me by miracle hitherto, could not preserve by his
power the provision which he had made for me by his goodness.
I reproached myself with my easiness, that would not sow any
more com one year, than would just serve me till the next season,
as if no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop
that was upon the ground. And this I thought so just a reproof,
that I resolved for the future to have two or three years corn
before--hand, so that whatever might come, I might not perish
for want of bread.

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man !
And by what secret differing springs are the affections hurried
about, as difi'ering circumstances present! To--day we love what
to--morrow we hate; to-day we seek what to-morrow we shun;
to-day we desire what to--morrow we fear, nay, even tremble at
the apprehensions of. This was exemplified in me at this time,
in the most lively manner imaginable; for I, whose only affliction
was, that I seemed banished from human society, that I was
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from man-
kind, and condemned to what I call a silent life; that I was as
one whom Heaven thought not worthy to be numbered among
the living, or to appear among the rest of his creatures; that to
have seen one of my own species, would have seemed to me a
raising me from death to life, and the greatest blessing that
Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation, could
bestow; I :11}, that I should now tremble at the very apprehen-
sions of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground, at
but the shadow, or silent appearance of a man's having set his
foot on the island!

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a
great many curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little
recovered my first surprise. I considered that this was the
station of life the infinitely wise and good providence of Goo
had determined for me; that as I could not foresee what the
ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was not to dis--
pute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature, had an undoubted
right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he
thought fit; and who, as I was a creature who had ofi'ended him,
had likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment
he thought fit; and that it was my part to submit to bear his
indignation, because I had sinned against him.

I then reflected that Goo, who was not only righteous, but
omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me,
so he was able to deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do
it, it was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and
entirely to his will. And, on the other hand, it was my duty
also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly to attend the die-
tates and directions of his daily providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may
say, weeks and months; and one particular effect of my cogita-
tions on this occasion I cannot omit; viz. one morning early,
lying in my bed, and filled with thoughts about my danger from
the appearance of savages, I found it discomposed me very much;
upon which those words of the scripture came into my thoughts,
Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glarifi me.

Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my bed, my heart was not
only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to pray ear-
nestly to Goo for deliverance. When I had done praying, I took
up my bible, and opening it to read, the first words that pre--
sented to me, were, Wait on the Lord, and he qf good cheer, and
he .thall strengthen thy heart: wait, I say, on the Lord. It is
impossible to express the comfort this gave me; and in return,
I thankfully laid down the book, and was no more sad; at least,
not on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflec-
tions, it came into my thoughts one day, that all this might be
a mere chimera of my own, and that this foot might be the print
of my own foot, when I came on shore from my boat. This
cheered me up a little too, and I began to persuade myself it
was all a delusion that it was nothing else but my own foot;
and why might not come that way from the boat as well as I
was going that way to the boat? Again, I considered also, that I
could by no means tell for certain where I had trod, and where
I had not; and that, if at last this was only the print of my own
foot, I had played the part of those fools, who strive to make
stories of spectres and apparitions, and then are themselves frighted
at them more than any body else.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again; for
I had not stirred out of my castle for three days and nighm, so
that I began to starve for provision; for I had little or nothing
within doors, but some barley-cakes and water. Then I knew
that my goats wanted to be milked too, which usually was my
evening diversion; and the poor creatures were in great pain and
inconvenience for want of it; and indeed it almost spoiled some
of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Hoartening myself therefore with the belief, that this was
nothing. but the print of one of my own feet, (and so I might
be truly said to start at my own shadow), I began to go abroad
again, and went to my country-house to milk my flock; but to
see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now-and--then, to lay down my
basket, and run for my life; it would have made any one have
thought I was haunted with an evil conscience, or that I had been
lately most terribly frighted; and so indeed I had.

However, as I went down thus two or three days, and having
seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and to think there
was really nothing in it but my own imagination; but I could
not persuade myself fully of this, till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my
own, and see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be
assured it was my own foot. But when I earne to the place, first, it
appeared evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could
not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts. Strand! , when
I me to measure the mark with my own foot, I found my foot
not so large by a great deal. Both these things filled my head
with new imaginations, and gave me the vapours again to the
highest degree; so that I shook with cold, like one in an ague,
and I went home again, filled with the belief that some man or
men had been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and
what course to take for my security, I knew not.

0 what ridiculous resolutions men take, when possessed with
fear! It deprives them of the use of those means which reason
offers for their relief. The first thing I proposed to myself was,
to throw down my enclosures, and turn all my tame eattle wild
into the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and then
frequent the island in prospect of the same, or the like booty;
then to the simple thing of digging up my two corn-fields, that
they might not find such a grain there, and still to be prompted
to frequent the island; then to demolish my bower and tent,'
that they might not see any vestiges of my habitation, and be
prompted to look farther, in order to find out the persons in-
habiting.

These were the subjects of the first night's cogimtion, after
I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so
over-run my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full
of vapours, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times
more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes;
and we find the burden of anxiety greater by much than the evil
which we are anxious about; but, which was worse than all this,
I had not that relief in this trouble from the resignation I used to
practise that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul,
who complained not only that the Phi/istinex were upon him, but
that Goo had forsaken him; for I did not now take due ways
to compose my mind, by crying to Goo in my distress, and
resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my defence
and deliverance'iwhich if I had done, I had at least been more
cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried
through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me waking all night; but
in the morning I fell asleep, and having by the amusement of my
mind been, as it were, tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept
very soundly, and awaked much better composed than I had ever
been before. And now I began to think sedately; and, upon
the utmost debate with myself, I concluded, that this island,
which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from
the main land than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandoned
as I might imagine. That although there were no stated inha-
bitants who lived on the spot; yet that there might sometimes
come boats of? from the shore, who either with design, or per-
haps never but when they were driven by cross winds, might
come to this place.
That Ihad lived here fifteen years now, and had not met with
the least shadow or figure of any people before; and that ifat
any time they should be driven here, it was probable they went
away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never
thought fit to fix there upon any occasion, to this time.

That the most I could suggest any danger from, was, from
any such casual accidental landing of straggling people from the
main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were
here against their wills; so they made no stay here, but went off
again with all possible speed, seldom staying one night on shore,
lest they should not have the help of the tides and day-light back
again; and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider
of some safe retreat, in case I should see any savages land upon
the spot.

Now I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large,
as to bring a door through again, which door, as I said, came
out beyond where my fortification joined to the rock. Upon
maturely considering this, therefore, I resolved to draw me a
second fortification, in the manner of a semicircle, at a distance
from my wall, just where I h planted a double row of trees
about twelve years before, of lich I made mention: these
trees having been planted so before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between em, that they should be thicker
and stronger, and my wall would be soon finished.

So that I had now a double wall, and my outer wall was
thickened with pieces of timber, old eablss, and every thingI
could think of to make it strong; having in it seven little holes,
about as big as I might put my arm out at. In the inside of
this I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, continually
bringing earth out of my eave, and laying it at the foot of the
wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven holes I con-
trived to plant the muskets, of which I took notice that I got
seven on shore out of the ship; these, I say, I planted like my

a
cannon, and fitted them into frames that held them like a wriage,
that so I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes time: this
wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never
thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done, I stuck all the ground without my wall,
for a great way every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the
osier-like wood, which I found so apt to grow, as they could well
stand; insomuch that I believe I might set in near twenty thou-
sand of them, leaving a pretty large space between them and my
wall, that I might have room to see an enemy, and they might
have no shelter from the young trees, if they attempted to ap-
proach my outer wall.

Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and in five or.
six years time I had a wood before my dwelling, grown so mon-
strous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable;
and no man of what kind soever would ever imagine that there
was any thing beyond it, much less a habitation: as for the way
I proposed myself to go in and out (for I left no avenue) it was
by setting two ladders; one to a part of the rock which was low,
and then broke in, and left room to place another ladder upon
that; so when the two ladders were taken down, no man living
could come down to me without mischiefing himself; and if
they had come down, they were still on the outside of my outer
wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest
for my own preservation; and it will be seen at length, that they
were not altogether without just reason; though I foresaw no-
thing at that time more than my mere fear suggested.

While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my
other affairs; for I had a great concern upon me for my little
herd of goats; they were not only a present supply to me upon
every occasion, and began to be sufficient for me, without the
expense of powder and shot, but also abated the fatigue of my
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loth to lose the advantage
of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.

To this purpose, after long consideration, I could think but
of two ways to preserve them: one was to find another conve-
nient place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive them into it
every night; and the other was to enclose two or three. little bits
of land, remote from one another, and as much concealed asI
could, where I might keep about half a dozen young goats in
each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in
general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble
and time: and this, though it would require a great deal of time
and labour, I thought was the most rational design.

Accordingly I spent some time to find out the most retired
parts of the island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private
indeed as my heart could wish; for it was a little damp piece
of ground in the middle of the hollow and thick woods, where,
as is observed, I almost lost myself once before, endeavouring to
come back that way from the eastern part of the island: here I
found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so surrounded with
woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at least it did
not want near so much labour to make it so, as the other pieces
of ground I had worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground, and in
less than a month's time I had so fenced it round, that my flock
or herd, call it which you please, which were not so wild now as
at first they might be supposed to be, were well enough secured
in it. So without any farther delay, I removed ten she-goats
and two he--goats to this piece; and when there, I continued to
perfect the fence, till I had made it as secure as the other, which,
however, I did at more leisure, and it took me up more time by
a great deal. .

All this labour I was at the expense of, purely from my appre-
hensions on the account of the print of a man's foot which I had
seen; for as yet, I never saw any human creature come near the
island; and I had now lived two years under these uneasinesses,
which indeed made my life much less comfortable than it was
before; as may well be imagined, by any who know what it is
to live in the constant snare of the fiar of man : and this I must
observe with grief too, that the discomposure of my mind had
too great impressions also upon the religious part of my thoughts;
for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of savages and
cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself in
a due temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with
the sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to
do. I rather prayed to COD as under great affliction and pressure
of mind, surrounded with danger, and in expectation every night
of being murdered and devoured before the morning; and I
must testify from my experience, that a temper of peace, thank-
fulness, love and affection, is much more the proper frame for
prayer than that of terror and discomposure; and that under the
dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a com--
forting performance of the duty of praying to Goo, than he is
for repentance on a sick-bed; for these discomposure: afi'ect the
mind as the others do the body; and the discomposure of the
mind must necessarily be as great a disability as that of the body,
and much greater, praying to GOD being properly an act of the
mind, not of the body.

But to go on: after I had thus secured one part of my little
living stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another
private place, to make such another deposit; when wandering
more to the west point of the island than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea at
a great distance. I had found a perspective glass or two in one
of the seamen's chests, which I saved out of our ship; but I had
it not about me; and this was so remote, that I could not tell
what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not
able to look any longer: whether it'was a boat, or not, I do not
know; but as I descended from the hill, I could see no more of
it, so I gave it over ; only I resolved to go no more without a
perspective glass in my pocket.

When I was come down the hill, to the end of the island,

where indeed I had never been before, I was presently convinced,
that the seeing the print of a man's foot, was not such a strange
thing in the island as I imagined; and, but that it-was a special
Providence that I was cast upon the side of the island where the
savages never came, I should easily have known, that nothing
was more frequent than for the canoe: from the main, when they
happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to that
side of the island for harbour; likewise, as they often met and
fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their
. dreadful customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat
them: of which hereafter.
' When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above,
being the S. W. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded
and amazed; nor is it possible for me to express the horror of
my mind, at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet, and
other bones of human bodies; and particularly I observed a place
where there had been a fire made, and a circle dug in the earth,
like a cock-pit, where it is supposed the savage wretches had sat
doWn to their inhuman feastings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, thatI enter-
tained no notions of any danger to myself from it .for a long
while; all my apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such
a pitch of inhuman, hellish brutality, and the horror of the de-
generacy of human nature; which, though I had heard of often,
yet I never had so near a view of before: in short, I turned away
my face from the horrid spectacle, my stomach grew sick, and
I was just at the point of fainting, when nature discharged the
disorder from my stomach, and, having vomited with an un-
common violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to
stay in the place a moment; so I got me up the hill again with
all the speed I could, and walked on towards my own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island, I stood
still awhile as amazed; and then recovering myself, Ilooked up
with the utmost affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears
in my eyes, gave Goo thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part
of the world where Iwas distinguished from such dreadful crea-
tures as these; and that though I had esteemed my present con-
dition very miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it,
that I had still more to give thanks for than to complain of; and
this above all, that I had, even in this miserable condition, been
comforted with the knowledge of himself, and the hope of his
blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to
all the misery which I had suffered or could suffer.

In this frame of thankfulness Iwent home to my castle, and
began to be much easier now, as to the safety of my circum-
stances, than ever I was before; for I observed, that these
wretches never came to this island in search of what they could
get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not expecting any
thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the covered
woody part of it, without finding any thing to their purpose. I
knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw
the least footsteps of a human creature there before; and might
be here eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now, if I did
not discover myself to them, which I had no manner of occasion
to do, it being my only business to keep myself entirely concealed
where I was, unless I found a better sort of creatures than can.
m'eals to make myself known to.

Yet I entertained such an abhorrence of the savage wretches
that I have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman
custom of their devouring and eating one another up, that I
continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my own circle
for almost two years after this: when I say my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations, viz. my castle, my country-
seat, which I ealled my bower, and my enclosure in the woods;
nor did I look after this for any other use than as an enclosure
for my goats; for the aversion which nature gave me to these
hellish wretches was such, that I was as fearful of seeing them as
of seeing the devil himself; nor did I so much as go to look
after my boat in all this time, but began rather to think of
making me another; for I could not think of ever making any
more attempts to bring the other boat round the island to me,
lest I should meet with some of those creatures at sea, in which,
if I had happened to have fallen into their hands, I knew what
Would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had, that I was in no
danger of being discovered by these people, began to wear off
my uneasiness about them; and I began to live just in the same
composed manner as before; only with this difference, that I
used more caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I did
before, lest I should happen to be seen by any of them; and
particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any of
them being on the island should happen to hear it; and it was there-
fore a very good providence to me, that I had furnished myself
with a tame breed of goats, thatI had no need to hunt any more
about the woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any more
of them after this, it was with traps and snares, as I had done
before: so that for two years after this, I believe I never fired
my gun once off, though I never went out without it; and,
which was more, as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, I
always carried them out with me, or at least two of them, stick-
ing them in my goat-skin belt. I likewise furbished up one of
the great cutlam that I had out of the ship, and made me a
belt to put it in also; so that I was now a most formidable
fellow to look at when I went abroad, if you add to the former
description of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a great
broad-sword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a scab-
bard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed,
excepting these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm sedate
way of living; all these things tended to show me more and
more how far my condition was from being miserable, compared
to some others; nay, to many other particulars of life, which it
might have pleased Goo to have made my lot. It put me upon
reflecting, how little repining there would be among mankind, at
any condition of life, if people would rather compare their con-
dition with those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with those which are better, to assist
their murmurings and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many things
which I wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been
in about these savage wretches, and the concern I had been in
for my own preservation, had taken of? the edge of my invention
for my own conveniences; andI had dropt a good design, which
I had once bent my thoughts upon; and that was, to try if I
could not make some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer: this was really a whimsical thought,
and I reproved myself often for the simplicity of it; for I pre--
sently saw there would be the want of several things necessary
to the making my beer, that it would be impossible for me to
supply; as, first, casks to preserve it in, which was a thing that,
as I have observed already, I could never compass; no, though
I spent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting
it, but to no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops to make
it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make
it boil; and yet, had not all these things intervened, I mean the
frights and terrors I was in about the savages, I had undertaken
it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave any
thing over without accomplishing it, when I once had it in my
head enough to begin it.

But my invention now ran quite another way; for night and
day I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of
these monsters in their cruel bloody entertainment, and if possi-
ble, save the victim they should bring hither to desn'oy. It
would take up a larger volume than this whole work is intended
to be, to set down all the contrivances I hatched, or rather
brooded upon in my thoughts, for the destroying these creatures,
or at least frightening them, so as to prevent their coming hither
any more; but all was abortive; nothing could be possible to
take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself; and what
could one man do among them, when perhaps there might be
twenty or thirty of them together, with their darts, or their bows
and arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a mark as I
could with my gun?

Sometimes I contrived to dig a hole under the place where
they made their fire, and put in five or six pounds of gunpowder,
which when they kindled their fire, would consequently take
fire, and blow up all that was near it; but, as in the first place
I should be very loth to waste so much powder upon them, my
store being now within the quantity of a barrel, so neither could
I be sure of its going ofl' at any certain time, when it might sur-
prise them; and, at best, that it would do little more than just
blow the fire about their ears, and fright them, but not suficient
to make them forsake the place; so I laid it aside, and then
proposed, that I would place myself in ambush, in some conve-
nient place, with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the
middle of their bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I should
be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shot;
and then falling in upon them with my three pistols and my

H 2
sword, I made no doubt but'that, if there were twenty, I should
kill them all: this fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks,
and I was so full of it that I often dreamt of it; and sometimes,
that I was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.

I went so far with it in my indignation, that I employed
myself several days to find out proper places to put myself in
ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them; and I went frequently
to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to me;
and especially while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of
revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the
sword, as I may call it; but the horror I had at the place, and
at the signals of the barbarous wretches devouring one another,
abated my malice.

Well, at length I found a place in the side of the hill, where
I was satisfied I might securely wait till I saw any of the boats
coming, and might then, even before they would be ready to
come on shore, convey myself unseen into thickets of trees, in
one of which there was a hollow large enough to conceal me
entirely; and where I might sit, and observe all their bloody
doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so
close together, as that it would be next to impossible that I
should miss my shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or
four of them at the first shoot.

In this place then I resolved to fix my design; and accordingly
I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling--piece. The
two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five
smaller bullets, about the size of pistol--bullets, and the fowling-
piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest
size; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each: and
in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and
third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme for my design, and in my
imagination put it in practice, I continually made my tour every
morning up to the top of the hill, which was from my castle, as
I called it, about three miles or more, to see if I could observe
any boats upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing over
towards it; but I began to tire of this hard duty, after I had for
two or three months constantly kept my watch ; but came always
back without any discovery, there having not in all that time
been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but
not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses could reach
every way.

As long as I kept up my daily tour to the hill to look out, so
long also I kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so outrageous
an execution, as the killing twenty or thirty naked savages, for
an offence which I had not at all entered into a discussion of in
my thoughts, any further than my passions were at first fired by
the horror I conceived at the unnatural custom of the people of
that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by Providence,
in his wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide than
that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and conse-
quently were left, and perhaps had been for some ages, to act
such horrid things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing
but nature, entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated by some
hellish degeneracy, could have run them into; but now, when,
as I have said, I began to be weary of the fruitless excursion
which I had made so long, and so far, every morning in vain;
so my opinion of the action itself began to alter, and I began,
with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what it was I was
going to engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend to
be judge and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom
Heaven had thought fit for so many ages to suffer, unpunished,
to go on, and to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments
upon one another; also, how far these people were offenders
against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of that
blood which they shed promiscuously one upon another. I deban
this very often with myself thus: How do I know what Goo him-
self judges in this particular case ? It is certain these people do not
commit this as a crime; it is not against their own consciences
reproving, or their light reproaching them. They do not know
it to be an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine justice,
as we do in almost all the sins we commit. They think it no
more a crime to kill a captive taken in war, than we do to kill

an ox; nor to eat human flesh, than we do to eat mutton.

When I had considered this a little, it followed necessarily,
that I was certainly in the wrong in it; that these people were
not murderers in the sense that I had before condemned them in
my thoughts, any more than those Christians were murderers,
who often put to death the prisoners taken in battle, or more
frequently, upon many occasions, put whole troops of men to
the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw down their
arms and submitted.

In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit the usage they
gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman, yet it was really
nothing to me: these people had done me no injury: that if
they attempted me, or I saw it necessary for my immediate
preservation to fall upon them, something might be said for it;
but that I was yet out of their power, and they had really no
knowledge of me, and consequently no design upon me; and
therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon them: that
this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards, in all their
barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions
of these people, who, however they were idolaters and bar~
barians, and had several bloody and barbarous rites in their
customs, such as sacrificing human bodies to their idols, were yet,
as to the Spaniards, very innocent people; and that the rooting
them out of the country is spoken of with the utmost abhor-
rence and detestation, even by the Spaniard: themselves, at this
time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere
butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable
either to Goa or man; and such, as for which the very name
of a Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all people
of humanity, or of Christian compassion; as if the kingdom of
Spain were particularly eminent for the product of a race of men,
who were without principles of tenderness, or the common
bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark
of a generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind
of a full stop; and I began by little and little to be 05 my
design, and to conclude I had taken a wrong measure in my
resolutions to attack the savages; that it was not my business to
meddle with them, unless they first attacked me, and this it was
my business, if possible, to prevent; but that, if I were dis-
covered and attacked, then I knew my duty.

On the other hand, I argued with myself, that this really was
the way, not to deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy
myself; for unless I was sure to kill every one that not only
should be on shore at that time, but that should ever come on
shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to tell their country- ,
people what had happened, they would come over again by
thousands to revenge the death of their fellows; and I should
only bring upon myself a certain destruction, which at present I
had no manner of occasion for.

Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in principles nor in
policy, I ought one way or other to concern myself in this affair:
that my business was by all possible means to conceal myself
from them, and not to leave the least signal to them to guess by,
that there were any living creatures upon the island, I mean of
human shape.

Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was convinced
now many ways that I was perfectly out of my duty, when I was
laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent
creatures, I mean innocent as to me; as to the crimes they were
guilty of towards one another, I had nothing to do with them :
they were national, and I ought to leave them to the justice of
Goo, who is the governor of nations, and knows how by national
punishments to make a just retribution for national offences;
and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in a public
manner, by such ways as best please him.

This appeared so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater
satisfaction to me, than that I had not been suffered to do a thing
which I now saw so much reason to believe would have been no
less a sin than that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and
I gave most humble thanks on my knees to Goo, that had thus
delivered me from blood-guiltiness, beseeching him to grant me
the protection of his Providence, that I might not fall into the
hands of barbarians; or that I might not lay my hands upon them,
unless I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of
my own life.

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this: and
so far was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these
wretches, that in all that time I never once went up the hill to
see whether there were any of them in sight, or to know whether
any of them had been on shore there or not; that I might not be
tempted to renew any of my contrivances against them, or be
provoked, by any advantage which might present itself, to fall
upon them; only this I did, I went and removed my boat, which
I had on the other side the island, and carried it down to the east
end of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove which I
found under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of
the currents, the savages durst not, at least would not, come with
their boats, upon any account whatsoever.

With my boat I carried away every thing that I had left there
belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither;
1212. a mast and sail, which I had made for her, and a thing like
an anchor, but indeed, which could not be called either anchor
or grappling : however, it was the best I could make of its kind.
All these I removed, that there might not be the least shadow of
any discovery, or any appearance of any boat, or of any habitation
upon the island.

Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever,
and seldom went fiom my cell, other than upon my constant
employment, viz. to milk my she-goats, and manage my little
flock in the wood, which, as it was quite on the other part of the
island, was quite out of danger: for certain it is, that these
savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came
with any thoughts of finding any thing here, and consequently
never wandered oil" from the coast; and I doubt not but they
might have been several times on shore, after my apprehensions
of them had made me cautious, as well as before; and indeed I
looked back with some horror upon the thoughts of what my
condition would have been, if I had chopped upon them, and
been discovered before that, when naked and unarmed, except
with one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot. I
walked every where peeping and peeping about the island, to see
what I could get: what a surprise should I have been in, if,
when I discovered the print of a man's foot, I had instead of that
seen fifteen or twenty savages, and found them pursuing me,
and, by the swiftness of their running, no possibility of my
escaping them!

The thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very soul within me,
and distressed my mind so much, that I could not soon recover
it; to think what I should have done, and howl not only should
not have been able to resist them, but even should not have had
praence of mind enough to do what I might have done; much
less what now, after so much consideration and preparation, I
might be able to do. Indeed, after serious thinking of these
things, I should be very melancholy, and sometimes it would
last a great while; but I resolved it at last all into thankfulness
to that Providence which had delivered me from so many unseen
dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs, which I could
no way have been the agent in delivering myself from; because
I had not the least notion of any such thing depending, or the
least supposition of it being possible.

This renewed a contemplation, which often had come to my
thoughts in former time, when first I began to see the merciful
dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in this
life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing
of it : how, when we are in a quandary (as we call it), a doubt
or hesitation, whether to go this way or that way, a secret hint
shall direct us this way, when we intended to go that way; nay,
when sense, our own inclination, and perhaps business, has called
to go the other way, yet a strange impression upon the mind,
from we know not what springs, and by we know not what
power, shall over--rule us to go this way; and it shall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that way which we should have gone,
and even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should
have been ruined and lost. Upon these, and many like reflec-
tions, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me, that whenever
I found those secret hints, or pressings of my mind, to doing or
not doing any thing that presented, or to going this way or that
way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I knew
no other reason for it, than that such a pressure, or such a hint,
hung upon my mind. I could give many examples of the
success of this conduct in the course of my life; but more espe-
cially in the latter part of my inhabiting this unhappy island;
besides many occasions which it is very likely I might have
taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes then that I saw
with now. But it is never too late to be wise; and I cannot
'but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with
such extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so
extraordinary, not to slight such secret intimations of Providence,
let them come from what invisible intelligence they will. That
I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but cer-
tainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits, and the secret
communication between those embodied and those unembodied;
and such a proof as can never be withstood; of which I shall
have oceasion to give some very remarkable instances, in the
remainder of my solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think strange, if I confess
that these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the
concern that was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and
to all the contrivances that I had laid for my future accommo-
dations and conveniences. I had the care of my safety more
now upon my hands than that of my food. I cared not to drive
a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I should
make should be heard; much less would I fire a gun, for the
same reason ; and above all, I was intolerably uneasy at making
any fire, lest the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in
the day, should betray me: and for this reason I removed that
part of my business which required fire, such as burning of pots
and pipes, (it. into my new apartment in the woods; where,
after I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable conso-
lation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast
way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he been at the mouth
of it, would be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed would any
man else, but one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a
safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock,
where, by mere accident (I would say, if I did not see an abun-
dant reason to ascribe all such things now to Providence), I was
cutting down some thick branches of trees to make charcoal;
and before I go on, I must observe the reason of my making
this charcoal, which was thus:

I was afraid of making a smoke about my habitation, as I said
before; and yet'I could not live there without baking my bread,

cooking my meat, 8:. so I contrived to burn some wood here,
as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it became chark,
or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I preserved the coal
to carry home, and perform the other services which fire was
wanting for at home, without danger of smoke.

But this is by the bye. While I was cutting down some wood
here, I perceived that behind a very thick branch of low brush-
wood, or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place. I was
curious to look into it, and getting with difliculty into the mouth
of it, I found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me
to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with me; but I must
confess to you, I made more haste out than I did in; when
looking farther into the place, and which was perfectly dark, I
saw two broad shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or
man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars, the dim light
from the cave's mouth shining directly in, and making the
reflection.

However, after some pause, I recovered myself, and began to
call myself a thousand fools, and tell myself, that he that was
afraid to see the devil, was not fit to live twenty years in an island
all alone, and that I durst to believe there was nothing in this
cave that was more frightful than myself: upon this, plucking
up my courage, I took up a great firebrand, and in I rushed
again, with the stick flaming in my hand. I had not gone three
steps in, but I was almost as much frighted as I was before; for
I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain; and
it was followed by a broken noise, a: if of words half--expressed,
and then a deep sigh again. I stepped back, and was indeed
struck with such a surprise, that it put me into a cold sweat;
and if I had had a hat on my head, I will not answer for it that
my hair might not have lifted it off. But still, plucking up my
spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a little, with
considering that the power and presence of Goo was every-
where, and was able to protect me; upon this I stepped forward
again, and by the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little
over my head, I saw lying on the ground a most monstrous
frightful old he-goat, just making his will, as we say, and gasping
for life, and dying indeed of mere old age.

I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he
essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I
thought with myself, he might even lie there; for if he had
frighted me so, he would certainly fright any of the savages, if
any of them should be so hardy as to come in there, while he
had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look
round me, when I found the cave was but very small; that is to
say, it might be about twelve foot over, but in no manner of
shape, either round or square, no hands ever having been em-
ployed in making it but those of mere nature. I observed also,
that there was a place at the farther side of it that went in farther,
but was so low, that it required me to creep upon my hands and
knees to go into it, and whither I went, I knew not; so having
no candle, I gave it over for some time, but resolved to come
again the next day, provided with candles and a tinder-box,
which I had made of the lock of one of the musquets, with some
wild-fire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with six large
candles of my own making (for I made very good candles now
of goats tallow); and going into this low place, I was obliged to
creep upon all fours, a: I have said, almost ten yards; which, by
the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering that
I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it. When
I was got through the might, I found the roof rose higher up,
I believe near twenty foot; but never was such a glorious sight
seen in the island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the sides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected an hundred
thousand lights to me from my two candles: what it was in the
rock, whether diamonds, or any other precious stones, or gold,
which I rather suppose it to be, I knew not.

The place I was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, of
its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the floor
was dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel upon it;
so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen;
neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof; the only
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as it was a place
of security, and such a retreat as I wanted, I thought that was a
convenience; so that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and
resolved, without any delay, to bring some of those things which
I was most anxious about to this place; particularly, I resolved
to bring hither my magazine of powder, and all my spare arms,
viz. tw0 fowling-pieces (for I had three in all) and three muskets
(for of them I had eight in all) ; so I kept at my castle only five,
which stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my outmost
fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.

Upon this occasion of removing my ammunition, I took
occasion to open the barrel of powder which I took up out of
the sea, and which had been wet; and I found that the water
had penetrated about three or four inches into the powder on
every side, which, caking and growing hard, had preserved the
inside like a kernel in a shell; so that I had near sixty pound of
very good powder in the centre of the cask; and this was an
agreeable discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away
thither, never keeping above two or three pound of powder with
me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind. I also carried
thither all the lead I had left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants, which are
said to live in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could
come at them; for I persuaded myself while I was here, if five
hundred savages were to hunt me, they could never find me out;
or if they did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, who I found expiring, died in the mouth of the
cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I found it
much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in, and
cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him
there, to prevent offence to my nose.

I was now in my twenty-third year of residence in this island,
and was so naturalized to the place, and to the manner of living,
that could I have but enjoyed the certainty that no savages would
come to the place to disturb me, I could have been content to
have capitulated for spending the rest of my time there, even to
the last moment, till I had laid me down and died, like the old
goat in the cave. I had also arrived to some little diversions and
amusements, which made the time pass more pleasantly with me
a great deal than it did before; as, first, I had taught my Poll,
as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and
talked so articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me;
and he lived with me no less than six-and--twenty years: how
long he might live afterwards I know not; though I know they
have a notion in the Brasils, that they live a hundred years;
perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still, calling after poor
Robin Crusoe to this day; I wish no Englifiman the ill luck to
come there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly
believe it was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and loving
companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and
then died of mere old age; as for my cats, they multiplied, as I
have observed, to that degree, that I was obliged to shoot several
of them at first, to keep them from devouring me and all I had;
but at length, when the two old ones I brought with me were
gone, and after some time continually driving them from me, and
letting them have no provision with me, they all ran wild into
the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept me,
and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned, and
these were part of my family. Besides these, I always kept twa
or three household kids about me, which I taught to feed out of
my hand; and I.had also more parrots which talked pretty well,
and would all call Robin Crusoe, but none like my first; nor,
indeed, did I take the pains with any of them that I had done
with him. I had also several tame sea fowls, whose names I
know not, who I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings;
and the little stakes, which I had planted before my castle wall,
being now grown up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived
among these low trees, and bred there, which was very agreeable
to me; so that, as I said above, I began to be very well contented
with the life I led, if it might but have been secured from the
dread of the savages.

But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all
people who shall meet with my story to make thisjust observation
from it, viz. How frequently, in the course of our lives, the evil
which in itself we seek most to shun, and which, when we are
fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes the very
means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be raised
again from the affliction we are fallen into. I could give many
examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but in
nothing was it more particularly remarkable than in the circum-
stances of my last years of solitary residence in this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my
twenty-third year; and this being the :aut/zern solstice, for
winter I cannot call it, was the particular time of my harvest,
and required my being pretty much abroad in the fields; when
going out pretty early in the morning, even before it was thorough
day-light, I was surprised with seeing a light of some fire upon
the shore, at a distance from me of about two mile, towards the
end of the island, where I had observed some savages had been,
as before; but not on the other side: but to my great affliction,
it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stepped short
within my grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised;
and yet I had no more peace within, fi-om the apprehensions I
had, that if these savages, in rambling over the island, should
find my com standing, or cut, or any of my works and improve-
ments, they would immediately conclude that there were people
in the place, and would then never give over till they had found
me out. In this extremity I went back directly to my castle,
pulled up the ladder after me, having made all things without
look as wild and natural as I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of
defence. I loaded all my cannon, as I called them, that is to
say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification,
and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last
gasp; not forgetting seriously to commend myself to the divine
protection, and earnestly to pray to GOD to deliver me out of the
hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I continued about
two hours, but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence
abroad, for I had no spies to send out.

After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in
this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance longer; so
setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was a flat
place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me, I set it up again, and mounted to the top of the hill; and
pulling out my perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose,
I laid me down flat on my belly on the ground, and began to
look for the place. I presently found there was no less than
nine naked savages sitting round a small fire they had made; not
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the weather being
extreme hot ; but, as I supposed, to dress some of their barbarous
diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether
alive or dead I could not know.

They had two came: with them, which they had hauled up
upon the shore; and as it was then tide of ebb, they seemed to
me to wait for the return of the flood to go away again. -It is
not easy to imagine what confusion this sight put me into,
especially seeing them come on my side the island, and so near
me too; but when I observed their coming must be always with
the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in
my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all
the time of the tide of flood, if they were not on shore before;
and having made this observation, I went abroad about my
harvest work with the more composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to
the wayward, I saw them all take boat, and row (or paddle as
we call it) all away. I should have observed, that for an hour
and more before they went off, they went to dancing, and I could

easily discern their postures and gestures by my glasses: I could
' not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they were stark
naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether
they were men or women, that I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns
upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle, and my great
sword by my side, without a scabbard; and with all the speed I
was able to make, I went away to the hill, where I had discovered
the first appearance of all. And as soon as I gat thither, which
was not less than two hours (for I could not go apace, being so
loaded with arms as I was), I perceived there had been three
canoe: more of savages on that place; and looking out farther, I
saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main.

This was a dreadful sight to me, especially when going down
to the shore, I could see the marks of horror which the dismal
work they had been about had left behind it, viz. the blood, the
bones, and part of the flesh of human bodies, eaten and devoured
by those wretches with merriment and sport. I was so filled with
indignation at the sight, that I began now to premeditate the
destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be who or how
many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which they thus make
to this island are not very frequent; for it was above fifteen
months before any more of them came on shore there again;
that is to say, I neither saw them, or any footsteps or signals of
them, in all that time; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are
sure not to come abrofi, at least not so far: yet all this while I
lived uncomfortably, by reason of the constant apprehensions I
was in of their coming upon me by surprise; from whence l
observe, that the expectation of evil is more bitter than the
sufi'ering, especially if there is no room to shake off that expec-
tation or those apprehensions.

During all this time, I was in the murdering humour; and
took up most of my hours, which should have been better
employed, in contriving how to circumvent and fall upon them
the very next time I should see them ; especially if they should
be divided, as they were the last time, into two parties; nor did
I consider at all, that if I killed one party, suppose ten or a
dozen, I was still the next day, or week, or month, to kill
another, and so another, even ad infinitum, till I should be at
length no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters,
and perhaps much more so.

I spent my days now in great perplexity and anxiety of mind,
expecting that I should one day or other fall into the hands of
these merciless creatures. And if I did at any firm venture
abroad, it was not without looking round me with the greatest
we and mution imaginable; and now I found to my great
comfort, how happy it was that I provided for a tame flock or
herd of goats; for I din-st not, upon any account, fire my gun,
especially near that side of the island where they usually came,
lestI should alarm the savages; and ifthey had fled from me
now, I was sure to have them come back again, with perhaps
two orthreehundredcuauwiththem in afewdays, andthenl
knew" what to expect. ' '

I .
However, I wore out a year and three months more before I
ever saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again,
as-I shall soon observe. It is true, they might have been there
once or twice, but either they made no stay, or, at last, I did
not hear them; but in the month of May, as near as I could
calculate, and in my four-and--twentieth year, I had a very strange
encounter with them, of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen or sixteen
months interval, was very great; I slept unquiet, dreamed always
frightful dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night:
in the day great troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the
night I dreamed often of killing the savages, and the reasons
why I might justify the doing of it. But to wave all this for a
while, it was in the middle of May, on the sixteenth day, I
think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon, for I
marked all upon the post still; I say, it was the sixteenth of
May, that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was after
it. I know not what was the particular occasion of it: but as I
was reading in the bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts
about my present condition, I was surprised with the noise of a
gun, as I thought, fired at sea.

This was, to be sure, a surprise of a quite different nature
from any I had met with before ; for the notions this put into my
thoughts were quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest
haste imaginable; and in a trice clapped my ladder to the middle
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mounting it the
second time, got to the top of the hill; the very moment that a
flash of fire bade me listen for a second gun, which accordingly
in about half a minute I heard, and by the sound knew that it
was from that part of the sea where I was driven out with the
current in my boat.

I immediately considered that this must be some ship in
distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship in
company, and fired these guns for signals of distress, and to
obtain help. I had this presence of mind at that minute as to
think, that though I could not help them, it may be they might
help me: so I brought together all the dry wood I could get at
hand, and making a good handsome pile, I set it on fire upon
the hill: the wood was dry, and blazed freely, and though the
wind blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, that I was certain,
if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it, and
no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I
heard another gun, and after that several others, all from the
same quarter. I plied my fire all night long, till day broke;
and when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I saw some-
thing at a great distance at sea, full cast of the island; whether
a sail or a hull I could not distinguish, no, not with my glasses,
the cfistance was so great, and the weather still something hazy
also; at least it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that
it did not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at
an anchor; and being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I
took my gun in my hand, and run toward the south side of the
island, to the rocks, where I had been formerly carried away with
the current; and getting up there, the weather by this time being
perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the wreck
of a ship cast away in the night upon those concealed rocks which
I found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks, as they
checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter-
stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering then from
the most desperate, hopeless condition, that ever I had been in,
in all my life.

Thus, what is one man's safety is another man's destruction;
for it seems these men, whoever they were, being out of their
knowledge, and the rocks being wholly under water, had been
driven upon them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and
E. IV. E. Had they seen the island, as I must necessarily sup-
pose they did not, they must, as I thought, have endeavoured
to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat;
but their firing of their guns for help, especially when they saw,
as I imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts: first, I
imagined, that, upon seeing my light, they might have put
themselves into their boat, and have endeavoured to make the
shore; but that the sea going very high, they might have been
cast away: other times I imagined, that they might have lost
their boat before, as might be the case many ways; as particu-
larly, by the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many
times obliges men to stave or take in pieces their boat; and
sometimes to throw it overboard with their own hands: other
times I imagined, they had some other ship or ships in company,
who, upon the signals of distress they had made, had taken them
up, and carried them off: otherwhiles I fancied they were all
gone off" to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the
current that I had been formerly in, were carried out into the
great ocean, where there was nothing but misery and perishing;
and that perhaps they might by this time think of starving, and
of being in a condition to eat one another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition
I was in, I could do no more than look upon the misery of the
poor men, and pity them; which had still this good effect on
my side, that it gave me more and more cause to give thanks
to Gov, who had so happily and comfortably provided for me
in my desolate condition; and that of two ships' companies, who
were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one life
should be spared but mine. I learned here again to observe,
that it is very rare that the providence of Goo casts us into any
condition of life so low, or any misery so great, but we may see
something or other to be thankful for, and may see others in
worse circumstances than our own. '
Such certainly was the we of these men, of whom I could
not so much as see room to suppose any of them were saved;
nothing could make it rational, so much as to wish or expect that
they did not all perish there, except the possibility only of their
being taken up by another ship in company: and this was but
mere possibility indeed; for I saw not the least signal or appear-
ance of any such thing.

I cannot explain, by any possible energy of words, what a
strange longing, or hankering of desires, I felt in my soul upon
this sight; breaking out sometimes thus: 0 that there had been
but one or two, nay, or but one soul saved out of the ship, to
have escaped to me, that I might but have had one companion,
one fellow-creature to have spoken to me, and to have conversed
with! In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt so earnest,
so strong a desire after the society of my fellow-creatures, or so
deep 3 regret at the want of it.

There are some secret moving springs in the afi'ections, which,
when they are set a going by some object in view, or be it some
object though not in view, yet rendered present to the mind by
the power of imagination, that motion carries out the soul by its
impetuosity to such violent eager cmbracings of the object, that
the absence of it is insupportable.

Such were these earnest wishings, That but one man had been
saved! 0 that it Izad been but one! I believe I repeated the
words, O that it had been but one! a thousand times; and my
desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words, my
hands would clinch together, and my fingers press the palms
of my hands, that if I hail had any soft thing in my hand, it
would have crushed it involuntarily ; and my teeth in my head
would strike together, and set against one another so strong, that
for some time I could not part them again.

Let the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and
manner ofthem: all I can say to them Is, to describe the fact,
' which was even surprising to me when I found it, though I knew
not from what it should proceed; it was doubtless the effect of
ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind, realizing
the comfort which the conversation of one of my fellow-chris-

tians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine, or both,

forbid it; for till the last year of my being on this island, I never
knew whether any were saved out of that ship, or no; and had
only the affliction some days after to see the corpse of a drowned
boy come on shore, at the end of the island which was next the
shipwreck: he had on no clothes but a seaman's waistcoat, a pair
of open-kneed lined drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing
to direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of: he had
nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight, and a tobacco:
pipe; the last was to me of ten times more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in
my boat to this wreck, not doubting butI might find something
on board that might be useful to me; but that did not altoge-
ther press me so much, as the possibility that there might be
yet some living creature on board, whose life I might not only
save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my own to the last
degree: and this thought clung so to my heart, that I could not
be quiet night nor day, but I must venture out in my boat on
board this wreck; and committing the rest to 6013's providence,
I thought the impression was so strong upon my mind, that it
could not be resisted, that it must come from some invisible
direction, and that I should be wanting to myself if I did not
go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my
castle, prepared every thing for my voyage, took a quantity of
bread, a great pot for fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle
of rum (for I had still a great deal of that left), a basket full of
raisins: and thus loading myself with every thing neceesary, I
went down to my boat, got the water out of her, and got her
afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went home again
for more: my second cargo was a great bag-full of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for shade, mother large pot-
full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my small loaves, or
barley cakes, more than before, with a bottle of goat's milk, and
a cheese; all which, with great labour and sweat, I brought to
my boat; and praying to GOD to direct my voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the eanoe along the shore, I eame at
last to the utmost point of the island, on that side, viz. N. E.
And now I was to launch out into the ocean, and either to ven-
ture, or not to venture; I looked on the rapid currents which
ran constantly on both sides of the island, at a distance, and
which were very terrible to me, from the remembrance of the
hazardI had been in before, and my heart began to fail me; for
I foresaw, that if I was driven into either of those currents, I
should be carried a vast way out to m, and perhaps out of my
reach or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat
was but small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be
inevitably lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I began to give
over my enterprise; and having haled my boat into a little creek
on the shore, I stepped out, and sat me down upon a little rising
bit of ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear and desire,
about my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could perceive that
the tide was turned, and the flood come' on, upon which my
going was for so many hours impracticable: upon this it pre-
sently occurred to me, that I should go up to the highest piece
of ground I could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of
the tide or currents lay, when the flood came in, that I might
judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might not expect
to bedriven another way home, with the same rapidness of the
currents. This thought was no sooner in my head, but I east
my eye upon a little hill which sufliciently overlooked the sea
both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the currents,
or sets of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my
return: here I found, that as the current of the ebb set out close
by the south point of the island, so the current of the flood set
in close by the shore of the north side; and that I had nothing
to do but to keep to the north of the island In my. return, and I
should do well enough.

Encouraged with this observation, I resolved the next mom--
ing to set out with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for
the night in the canoe, under the great watch-coat I mentioned,
I launched out. I made first a little out to sea, full north, till I
began to feel the benefit of the current, which set eastward, and
which earried me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as
the southern-side current had done before, and so as to take from
me all government of the boat; but having a strong steerage
with my paddle, I went at a great rate, directly for the wreck,
and in less than two hours I came up to it.

It was a dismal sight to look at; the ship, which by its build-
ing was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in between two rocks; all
the stern and quarter of her was beaten to pieces with the sea;
and as her fore-castle, which stuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast were brought by
the board, that is to say, broken short of, but her bowsprit was
sound, and the head and bow appeared firm. When I came
close to her, a dog appeared upon her, who, seeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and as soon as I called him, jumped into the
sea to come to me; and I took him into the boat, but found
him almost dead for hunger and thirst. I gave him a eake of
my bread, and he ate like a ravenous wolf that had been starving
a fortnight in the snow. I then gave the poor creature some
fresh water, with which, if I would have let him, he would have
burst himself.

After this I went on board: but the first sight I met with
was two men drowned in the cook-room, or formstle of the
ship, with their arms fast about one another. I concluded, as
is indeed probable, that when the ship struck, it being in a storm,
the see broke so high, and so continually over her, that the men
were not able to bear it, and were strangled with the constant
rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under
water; besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that
had life, nor any goods that I could see, but what were spoiled
by the water: there were some casks of liquor, whether wine or
brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the
water being ebbed out, I could see; but they were too big to
meddle with. I saw several chests, which I believed belonged
to some of the seamen, andI got two of them into the boat with-
out examining what was in them.

Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore-part broken
off, I am persuaded I, might have made a good voyage; for by
what I found in these two chests, I had room to suppose the ship
hadagreatdealofwealthon board; andifImay gueesbythe
course she steered, she must have been bound from the Bum:
lynx, or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, be-
yond the Bran'b, to the Havana, in the gulph of Mexico, and
so perhaps to Spain. She had, no doubt, a great treasure in her,
but of no use at that time to any body; and what became of the
rest of her people I then knew not.

I found, besides these chess, a little cask full of liquor, of
about twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much dif-
ficulty: there were several musquets in a eabin, and a great
powder-horn, with about four pounds of powder in it; as for the
musquets, I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder-horn; I took a fire-shovel and tongs, which I wanted
extremely; as also two little brass kettles,acopperpot to make
chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I
came away, the tide beginning to make home again; and the

r 2
same evening about an hour within night, I reached the island
again, weary and fatigued to the last degree. ' ,

I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morning I resolved
to harbour what I had gotten in my new cave, not to carry
it home to my eastle. After refreshing myself, I got all my
cargo on shore, and began to examine the particulars: the cask
of liquor I found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had'at
the Brasilr; and, in a word, not at all good; but when I tame
to open the chests, I found several things of great use to me:
for example, I found in one a fine case of bottles, of an extra-
ordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good;
the bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped with
silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or sweet-meats,
so fastened also on the top, that the salt water had not hurt
them; and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled.
I found some very good shirts, which were very welcome to
me, and about a dozen and half of white linen handkerchiefs,
and coloured neckcloths; the former were also very welcome,
being exceeding refreshing, to wipe my face in a hot day; be-
sides this, when I came to the till in the chests, I found there
three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven
hundred pieces in all ; and in one of them, wrapt up in a paper,
six doubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold;
I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.

The other chest I found had some clothes in it, but of little
value; but by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the
gunner's mate, though there was no powder in it, but about two
pounds of glazed powder in the three flasks, kept, I suppose, for
charging their fowling-pieces on occasion. Upon the whole, I
got very little by this voyage that was of any use to me; for as
to the money, I had no manner of occasion for it; it was to me
as the dirt under my feet; and I would have given it for three

or four pair of English shoes and stockings, which were things I
greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet now for many years
I had, indeed, gotten two pair of shoes now, which I took of
the feetofthetwodrowned menwhomlsawin thewreck; and
I found two pair more in one of the chests, which were very
welcome to me; but they were not like our English shoes, either
for ease or service, being rather what we all pumps than shoes.
I found in this seaman's chest about fifty pieces of eight in royals,
but no gold; I suppose this belonged to a poorer man than the
other, which seemed to belong to some oficer.

Well, however, I lugged this money home to my cave, and
laid it up, as I had done that before which I brought from our
own ship; but it was great pity, as I said, that the other partof
the ship had not come to my share, for I am satisfied I might
have loaded my cause several times over with money, which, if
I had ever escaped to England, would have lain here safe enough
till I might have come again and fetched it.

Having now brought all my things on shore, and secured
them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along
the shore to her old harbour, where I laid her up, and made the
best of my way to my old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet; so I began to repose myself, live after my old
fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for a while I
lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if
at any time I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the
east part of the island, where I was pretty well satisfied the
savages never eame, and where I could go without so many pre-
cautions, and such a load of arms and ammunition, as I always
carried with me, if I went the other way.

I lived in this condition near two years more; but my un-
lucky head, that was always to let me know it was born to make
my body miserable, was all these two years filled with projects
and designs, how, if it were possible, I might get away from
this island; for sometime: I was for making another voyage to

the wreck, though my reason told me, that there was nothing left

there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a ramble

one way, sometimes another; and I believe verily, if I had the.
boat that I went fi-om Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea,

bound any where, I knew not whither.

I have been, in all my circumstances, a memento to those who
are touched with that general plague of mankind, whence, for
aught I know, one half of their miseries flow ; I mean, that of
not being satisfied with the station wherein Goo and nature has
placed them; for, not to look back upon my primitive condi-
tion, and the excellent advice of my father, the opposition to
which was, as I may tall it, my original sin, my subsequent mis-
takes of the same kind had been the means of my coming into
this miserable condition; for had that Providence, which so
happily had seated me at the Brasil: as a planter, blessed me
with confined desires, and I could have been contented to have
gone on gradually, I might have been by this time, [mean in the
time of my being in this island, one of the most considerable
planters in the Brasils; nay, I am persuaded, that by the imo
provements I had made in that little time I lived there, and the
increase I should probably have made if I had staid, I might have
been worth an hundred thousand moidorer; and what business
had I to leave a settled fortune, well-stocked plantation, improv-
ing and increasing, to turn :upermrga to Guinea, to fetch Ne-
groes, when patience and time would so have increased our stock
at home, that we could have bought them at our own doors,
from those whose business it was to fetch them? And though it
had cost us something more, yet the difference of that price was
by no means worth saving at so great a hazard.

But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, so reflection
upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exercise of more years, or
. of the dear-bought experience of time; and so it was with me
now; andyet, sodeephadthemistaketaken rootinmytem-
per, that I could not satisfy myself in my station, but was con-
tinually poring upon the means and possibility of my eseape from
this place; and that I may, with the greater pleasure tothe
reader, bringontheremainin'gpart ofmystory, it may not be
improper to give some account of my first conceptions on the
subject of this foolish scheme for my escape; and how and upon
what foundation I acted.

I am now to be supposed to be retired into my castle, after
my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate laid up, and secured
under water as usual, and my condition restored to what it was
before. I had more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was
not at all the richer; .for I had no more use for it than the
India>>: of Peru had before the Spaniard: came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in Marc/r, the
four--and--twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of
solitariness, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, and very
well in health, had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body,
no, nor any uneasiness of mind more than ordinary, but could by
no means close my eyes, that is, so as to sleep; no, not a wink
all night long, otherwise than as follows:

It is as impossible as needless to set down the innumerable
crowd of thoughts that whirled through that great thoroughfare
of the brain, the memory, in this night's time. I run over the
whole history of my life in miniature, or by abridgment, a: I
may call it, to my coming to this island; and also of the part of
my life since I came to this island. In my reflections upon the
state of my case, since I eame on shore on this island, I was
comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of
my habitation here, compared to the life of anxiety, fear, and
eare,whichlhadlivedeversincelhadseenthe print ofafoot
in the sand; not that I did not believe the savages had fre-
quented the island even all the while, and might have been
several hundreds of them at times on the shore there; but I had
never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions about
it, my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same;
and I was as happy in not knowing my danger, as if I had never
really been exposed to it; this furnished my thoughts with many
very profitable reflections, and particularly this one: How infi-
nitely good that Providence is, which has provided in its govern-
ment of mankind such narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge
of things; and though he walks in the midst of so many thou-
sand dangers, the sight of 'which, if discovered to him, would
distract his mind, and sink his spirits, he is kept serene and calm,
by having the event of things hid from his eyes, and knowing
nothing the dangers which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I
came to reflect seriously upon the real danger I had been in for
so many years in this very island; and how I had walked about
in the greatest security and with all possible tranquillity, even
when perhaps nothing but a brow of a hill, a great tree, or the
casual approach of night, had been between me and the worst
kind of destruction, 'viz. that of falling into the hands of cannibals
and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view
as I did of a goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a
crime to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a curlew;
I would unjustly slander myself, if I should say I was not sin-
cerely thankful to my great Preserver, to whose singular protec-
tion I acknowledged, with great humility, that all these unknown
deliverances were due, and without which I must inevitably have
fallen into their merciless hands.

When these thoughts were over, my head was for some time
taken up in considering the nature of these wretched creatures, I
mean, the savages; and how it came to pass in the world, that
the wise Governor of all things should give up any of his crea-
tures to such inhumanity, nay, to something so much below even
brutality itself, as to devour its own kind: but as this ended in
some (at that time fmitless) speculations, it occurred to me to
inquire what part of the world these wretches lived in; how
far of? the coast was from whence they came; what they ven-
tured over so far from home for; what kind of boats they had;
and why I might not order myself, and my business so, that I
might be as able to go over thither as they were to come to me.

I never so much as troubled myself to consider, what I should
do with myself when I came thither; what should become of me
if I fell into the hands of the savages; or how I should escape
from them, if they attempted me; no, nor so much as how it
was possible for me to reach the coast, and not be attempted by
some or other of them, without any possibility of delivering
myself; and if I should not fall into their hands, whatI should
do for provision, or whither I should bend my course; none of
these thoughts, I say, so much as came in my way; but my
mind was wholly bent upon the notion of my passing over in my
boat to the main land. I looked back upon my present condition
as the most miserable that could possibly be; that I was not able
to throw myself into any thing but death, that could be called
worse; that if I reached the shore of the main, I might, perhaps,
meet with relief; or I might coast along, as I did on the shore
of Afrim, till I came to some inhabited country, and where I
might find some relief; and after all, perhaps, I might fall in
with some Christian ship that might take me in; and if the
worst came to the worst, I could but die, which would put an
end to all these miseries at once. Pray, note, all this was the
fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient temper, made, as it were,
desperate by the long continuance of my troubles, and the dis-
appointments I had met in the wreck I had been on board of,
and where I had been so near the obtaining what I so earnestly
longed for, 'viz. somebody to speak to, and to learn some know-
ledge from of the place where Iwas, and of the probable means
of my deliverance : I say, Iwas agitated wholly by thwe thoughts.
All my calm of mind in my resignationto Providence, and wait-
ing the issue of the dispositions of Heaven, seemed to be sus-
pended; and I had, as it were, no power to turn my thoughts
to any thing but to the project of a voyage to the main; which
came upon me with such force, and such an impetuosity of de-
sire, that it was not to be resisted.

When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours or more,
with such violence that it set my very blood into a ferment, and
my pulse beat as high as if I had been in a fever, merely with
the extraordinary fervour of my mind about it, nature, as if I
had been fatigued and exhausted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a sound sleep: one would have thought I should
have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of any thing relating to
it; but I dreamed that I was going out in the morning, as usual,
from my castle, I saw upon the shore two canoes, and eleven
savages coming to land, and that they brought with them ano-
ther savage, who they were going to kill, in order to eat him;
when, on a sudden, the savage that they were going to kill,
jumped away, and ran for his life; then I thought in my sleep,
that he came running into my little thick grove, before my for--
tification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not
perceiving that the others sought him that way, shewed myself
to him, and smiling upon him, encouraged him, that he kneeled
down to me, seeming to pray me to assist him; upon which I
shewed my ladder, made him go up, and carried him into my
cave, and he became my servant; and that as soonas I had got-
ten this man, I said to myself, Now I may certainly venture to
the main land; for this fellow will serve me as a pilot, and will
tell me what to do, and whether to go for provisions, and whe-
ther not to go for fear of being devoured; what places to venture
into, and what to escape. I waked with this thought, and was
under such inexpreesible impressions of joy, at the prospect of
my eseape in my dream, that the disappointments which I felt
upon coming to myself, and finding it was no more than a dream,
were equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into a
very great dejection of spirit.

Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that my only
way to go about an attempt for an eseape, was, if possible, to
get a savage into my possession; and, if possible, it should be
one of their prisoners whom they had condemned to be eaten,
and should bring thither to kill; but these thoughts still were
attended with this difliculty, that it was impossible to effect this
without attacking a whole earavan of them, and killing them all ;
and this was not only a very desperate attempt, and might mis-
earry; but, on the other hand, I had greatly scrupled the lawful-
ness of it to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of
shedding so much blood, though it was for my deliverance. I
need not repeat the arguments which occurred to me against this,
they being the same mentioned before: but though I had other
reasons to olfer now, viz. that those men were enemies to my
life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was self--pre-
servation, in the highest degree, to deliver myself from this
death of a life, and was acting in my own defence, as much as if
they were actually assaulting me, and the like; I say, though
thwe things argued for it, yet the thoughts of shedding human
blood for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and such as I
could by no means reconcile myself to a great while.

However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and
after great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way
and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager pre-
vailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest, and
I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into my hands,
cost what it would: the next thing then was to contrive how to
doit; andthisindeedwasvery dilliculttoresolveon: butasI
could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put210 ern AND ADvnn'wus

myself upon the watch to see them when they eame on shore,
and leave the rest to the event, taking such measures as the
opportunity should present, let be what would be.

With these resolutions in my thoughts, I set myself upon the
scout as often as possible, and indeed so often, till I was heartily
tired of it; for it was above a year and a half that I waited, and
for great part of that time went out to the we." end, and to the
math-west corner of the island, almost every day, to see for
canoes, but none appeared : this was very discouraging, and began
to trouble me much; though I mnnot say that it did in this case,
as it had done some time before that, 'm'z. wear of the edge of
my desire to the thing ; but the longer it seemed to be delayed,
the more eager Iwas for it: in a word, I was not atfirst so
careful to shun the sight of these savages, and avoid being seen
by them, as I was now eager to be upon them.

Besides, I fancied myself able to manage one, nay, two or
three savages, if I had them, so as to make them entirely slaves
to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their
being able, at any time, to do me any hurt. It was a great while
that I pleased myself with this affair, but nothing still presented;
all my fancies and schemes came to nothing, for no savages came
near me for a great while.

About a year and half after I had entertained these notions,
and, by long musing, had, as it were, resolved them all into
nothing, for want of an occasion to put them in execution, I was
surprised one morning early, with seeing no less than five anoes
all on shore together, on my side the island, and the people who
belonged to them all landed, and out of my sight: the number
of them broke all my measures; for seeing so many, and know-
ing that they always mme four, or six, or sometimes more, in a
boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
measures to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; so I lay
still in my castle, perplexed and discomforted: however I put
myselfinto all the same postures for an attack that I had formerly
provided, and was just ready for action, if any thing had pre-
sented. Having waited a good while, listening to hear if they
made any noise; at length being very impatient, I set my guns
at the foot of my ladder, and clambered up to the top of the hill
by my two stages, as usual ; standing so, however, that my head
did not appear above the hill, so that they could not perceive me
by any means: here I observed, by the help of my perspective
glass, that they were no less than thirty in number; that they
had a fire kindled, that they had had meat dressed; how they
had cooked it, that I knew not, or what it was ; but they were
all dancing in I know not how many barbarous gettures and
figures, their own way, round the fire.

When I was thus looking on them, I perceived by my per-
spective two miserable wretchea dragged fi'om the boats, where,
it seems, they were laid by, and were now brought out for the
slaughter. I perceived one of them immediately fell, being
knocked down, I suppose, with a club or wooden sword, for that
was their way; and two or three others were at work immediately,
cutting him open for their cookery, while the other victim was
left standing by himself, till they should be ready for him: in
that very moment this poor wretch, seeing himself a little at
liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life, and he started
away from them, and ran with incredible swiftness along the
sands, directly towards me, I mean, towards that part of the
coast where my habitation was.

I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknowledge) when I
perceived him to run my way ; and especially when, as I thought,
I saw him pursued by the whole body; and now I expected that
part of my dream was coming to pass, and that he would cer-
tainly cake shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, by any
means, upon my dream for the rest of it, viz. that the other
lavagea would not pursue him thither, and find him there.
However, I kept my station, and my spirits began to recover,
when I found that there were not above three men that followed
him; and still more was I encouraged, when I found he outstrip:
them exceedingly in running, and gained ground of them, so that
if he could but hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would
fairly get away from them all.

There was between them and my castle the creek, which I
mentioned often at the first part of my story, when I landed my
cargoes out of the ship; and this I saw plainly he must nee-s
sarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be taken there; but
when the savage escaping came thither, he made nothing of it,
though the tide was then up; but plunging in, swam through
in about thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three persons came
to the creek, I found that two of them could swim, but the
third could not, and that, standing on the other side, he looked
at the other, but went no further; and soon after went softly
back again, which, as it happened, was very well for him in the
mam.

I observed, that the two who swam were yet more than twice
as long swimming over the creek as the fellow was that fled from
them. It came now very warmly upon my thoughts, and
indeed irresistibly, that now was my time to get a servant, and
perhaps a companion, or assistant, and that I was called plainly
by Providence to save this poor creature's life. I immediately
run down the ladders with all possible expedition, fetches my
two guns, for they were both at the foot of the ladder, as I
observed above; and getting up again with the same haste to the
top of the hill, I crossed toward the sea; and having a very short
cut, and all down hill, clapped myself in the way between the
pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who,
looking back, was at first perhaps as much frighted at me as I at
them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come back; and
in the mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two that
followed; then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knocked
him down with the stock of my piece; I was loth to fire, because
I would not have the rest hear, though at that distance it would
not have been easily heard; and being out of sight of the smoke
too, they would not have easily known what to make of it.
Having knocked this fellow down, the other who pursued with
him stopped, as if he had been frightened, and I advanced apace
towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he had
a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was
then necessitated to shoot at him first; which I did, and killed
him at the first shoot. The poor savage who fled, but had
stopped, though he saw both his enemies fallen, and killed (as
he thought) yet was so frighted with the fire and noise of my
piece, that he stood stock--still, and neither eame forward or went
backward, though he seemed rather inclined to fly still than to
come on. I hallooed again to him, and made signs to come
forward, which he easily understood, and came a little way, then
stopped again, and then a little further, and stopped again; and
I could then perceive that he stood trembling, as if he had been
taken prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two enemies
were. I beckoned him again to come to me, and gave him all the
signs of encouragement that I could think of; and he eame nearer
and nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
acknowledgment for savi g his life. I smiled at him and looked
pleasantly, and beckoned to him to come still nearer. At length
he eame close to me, and he then kneeled down again, kissedthe
ground, and laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by
the foot, set my foot upon his head. This, it seems, was in
token of swearing to be my slave for ever. I took him up, and
made much of him, and encouraged him all I could. But there
was more work to do yet; for I perceived the savage, who I
knocked down, was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and
began to come to himself: so I pointed to him, and shewed' hini
the savage, that he was not dead: upon this he spoke some words
to me; and though I could not understand them, yet I thought
they were pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a
man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-
five years. But there was no time for such reflections now: the
savage, who was knocked down, recovered himself so far as to
sit up upon the ground; and I perceived that my savage began to
be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other piece at
the man, as if I would shoot him: upon this my savage, [hr :0
I call him now, made a motion to me to lend him my sword,
which hung naked in a belt by my side; 501 did: he no sooner
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one blow cut off his
head so cleverly, no executioner in Germany could have done it
sooner or better; which I thought very strange for one, who, I
had reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords. However it seems, as I learned
afterwards, they make their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy,
and the wood is so hard, that they will cut of heads even with
them, ay, and arms, and that at one blow too. When he had
done this, he comes laughing to me in sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again, and, with abundance of gestures,

which I did not understand, laid it down, with the head of the
savage that he had killed, just before me.

But that which astonished him most was, to know how I had
killed the other Indian so far 01?; so pointing to him, he made
signs to me to let him go to him: so I bade him go, as well as
I could. When he came to him, he stood like one amazed,
looking at him; turned him first on one side, then on the other;
looked at the wound the bullet had made, which it seems wasjust
in his breast, where it had made a hole, and no great quantity of
blood had followed; but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite
dead: hetookuphis bowandarrows,andcameback; soItumed
to go away, and beckoned him to follow me, making signs to him
that more might come after them.

Upon this he signed to me that he should bury them with
sand, that they might not be seen by the rest, if they followed;
and so I made signs again to him to do so: he fell to work, and
in an instant he had scraped a hole in the sand with his hands,
big enough to bury the first in, and then dragged him into it,
and covered him, and did so also by the other. I believe he had
buried them both in a quarter of an hour: then ealling him away,
I carried him not to my castle, but quite away to my cave, on
the farther part of the island; so I did not let my dream come
to pass in that part; viz. that he came into my grove for
shelter.

Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a'
draught of water, which I found he was indmd in great distress
for, by his running; and having refreshed him, I made signs for
him to go lie down and sleep, pointing to a place where I had
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket upon it, which I
used to sleep upon myself sometimes: so the poor creature lay
down and went to sleep.

He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well made, with
straight long limbs, not too large, tall, and well-shaped, and, as
I reckon, about twenty-six years of age. He had a. very good
countenance, not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to' have
something very manly in his face, and yet he had all the sweet-
ness and softness of an' European in his countenance too, especially
when he smiled: his hair was long and black, not curled like
wool; his forehead very high and large, and a great vivacity and
sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The colour of his skin was not
quite black, but very tawny, and yet not of an ugly yellow
nauseous tawny, as the Brasilia>>: and Virginians, and other
natives of America are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive
colour, that had in it something very agreeable, though not very
easytodescribe. Hisfacewasroundandplump,hisnose
small, not flat like the negroes, a very good mouth, thin lips,
and his fine teeth, well-set, and white as ivory. After he had
slumbered, rather than slept, about half an hour, he waited again,
and comes out of the eave to me, for I had been milking my
goats, which I had in the enclosure just by. When he espied
me, he came running to me, laying himself down again upon
the ground, with all the possible signs of an humble thankful
disposition, making many antic gestures to shew it. At last he
lays his head flat upon the ground, close to my foot, and sets my
other foot upon his head, as he had done before ; and after this,
made all the signs to me of subjection, servitude, and submission
imaginable, to let me know how he would serve me as long as
he lived. I understood him in many things, and let him know
I was very well pleased with him. In a little time I began to
speak to him, and teach him to speak to me: and first, I made
him know his name should be Friday, which was the day I saved
his life; I ealled him so for the memory of the time. I likewise
taught him to say Matter, and then let him know that was to be
my name; I likewise taught him to say Yes and No, and to
know the meaning of them. I gave him some mill: in an
earthen pot, and let him see me drink it before him, and sop my
bread in it; and I gave him a eake of bread to do the like, which
he quickly complied with, and made signs that it was very good
for him.

I kept there with him all that night; but as soon as it was
day, I beckoned him to come with me, and let him know I
would give him some clothes; at which he seemed very glad, for
he was stark--naked. As we went by the place where he had
buried the two men, he pointed exactly to the spot, and shewed
me the marksthat he hadmadetofindthemagain,making
signs to me that we' should dig them up again and eat them;
At this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrenoe of it,
made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of it, and beckoned
with my hand to him to come away, which he did immediately,
with great submission. I then led'him up to the top of the hill,
to see if'his enemies were gone, and pulling out my glass, I
looked, and saw plainly the place where they had been, but no
appearance of them, or of their canoes; so that it was plain that
they were gone, and had left their two comrades behind them,
without any search after them.

- But I "was not content with this discovery; but having now
more courage, and consequently more curiosity, I takes my man
Friday with'me, giving him the sword in his hand, with the bow
and-arrows at his back, which I found he could use very dexta--
ously, making him entry one gun for me, and I two for myself,
and away we marched to the place where these creatures had
been;' for I had a mind now to get some fuller intelligence of
them. When I esme to the'place, my very blood ran chill in
my veins, and my heart sunk within me at the horror of the
spectacle: indeed it was a dreadful sight, at least it was'so to
me, though Friday made nothing of it; The place was covered
with human bones, the ground dyed with their blood, great
pieces of flesh left here and there half-eaten, mangled, and
scorched; and, in short, all the tokens of the triumphant fess:
they had been making there, after a victory over their enemies.
I saw three skulls, five hands, and the bones of three or four
legs and feet, and abundance of other parts of the bodies; and
Friday, by his signs, made me understand that they brought
over four prisoners to feast upon; that three of them were eaten
up, and that he; pointing to himself, was the fourth: that there
had been a great battle between them andtheirnextlting, whose
subjects, it seems, he'had been one of; and that they had taken
a-grat number of- prisoners, all which were esrried'to several
places by those that had taken them in the fight, inordertofesst

K
upon them, as was done here by these wretches upon those they
brought hither.

I caused Friday to gather all the skulls, bones, flesh, and
whatever remained, and lay them together on a heap, and make
a great fire upon it, and burn them all to ashes. I found Friday
had still a hankering stomach after some of the flesh, and was
still a cannibal in his nature; but I discovered so much abhor-
rence at the very thoughts of it, and at the least appearance of
it, that he durst not discover it; for I had, by some means, let
him know, that I would kill him if he offered it.

When we had done this, we came back to our castle, and
there I fell to work for my man Friday. And first of all, I
gave him a pair of linen drawers which I had out of the poor
gunner's chest I mentioned, and which I found in the wreck;
and which, with a little alteration, fitted him very well: then I
made him a jerkin of goat's-skin as well as my skill would
allow, and I was now grown a tolerably good tailor: and I gave
him a cap, which I had made of a hare-skin, very convenient,
and fashionable enough: and thus he was dressed, for the
present, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleased to see him-
self almost as well clothed as his master: it is true, he went
awkwardly in these things at first; wearing the drawers was very
awkward to him, and the sleeves of the waistcoat galled his
shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little easing them,
where he complained they hurt him, and using himself to them,
at length he took to them very well.

The next day after I eame home to my hutch with him, I
began to consider where I should lodge him; and that I might
do well for him, and yet be perfectly easy myself, I made alittle
tent for him in the vacant place between my two fortifieations,
in the inside of the last, and in the outside of the first: and as
there was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a formal
framed door-case, and a door to it of boards, and set it up in the
passage,alittle within theentranee; mdcausingthedoortoopen
ontheinside,Ibarred it upindienighgtakinginmyladden
too; so that Friday could no waycome atmeinthe insideof
my innermost-wall, without making so much noise in getting
over, that itmust needs waken me; for my firstwall hadnowa
complete roof over it of long poles, covering all my tent, and '
leming up to the side of the hill, which was again laid across
with small sticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great
thickness with the rice-straw, which was strong like reeds; and
at the hole or place which was left to go in or out by the ladder,
I had placed a kind of trap-door, which if it had been attempted
on the outside, would not have opened at all, but would have
fallen down, and made a great noise; and as to weapons, I took
them all into my side every night.

But I needed none of all this precaution; for never man had
a more faithful, loving, sincere servant than Friday was to me;
without passions, sullenness or designs; perfectly obliged and
engaged; his very affections were tied to me, like those of a
child to a father; and I dare say he would have sacrificed his life
for the saving mine, upon any oceasion whatsoever: the many
testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt; and soon
convinced me, that I needed to use no precautions as to my safety
on his account.

This fi'equently gave me occasion to observe, and that with
wonder, that however it had pleased Goo in his providence, and
in the government of the works of his hands, to cake from so
great a part of the world, ofhis creatures, the best uses towhich
their faculties and the powers of their souls are adapted; yet
that he has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same
reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness and
obligation, the same passions and resentment: of wrongs, the
same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities
ofdoinggood,andreceivinggood,thathehasgiventous; and
that when he pleases to offer to them oceasions of exerting these,
they are as ready, nay, more ready to apply them to the right
uses for which they were bestowed than we are. And this made
me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several
occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, even
though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of
instruction, the Spirit of Goo, and by the knowledge of his
word, added to our understanding; and why it has pleased G0!)
to hide the like saving knowledge from so many millions of souls,
who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much
better use of it than we did.

From hence I sometimes was led too far to invade the sove-
reignty of Providence; and, as it were, arraign the justice of so
arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that light from
some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from
both: but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this con--
clusion. First, that we did not know by what light and law
these should be condemned; but that as Goo was necessarily,
and by the nature of his being, infinitely holy 'and just, so it
could not be, but that if these creatures were all sentenced to
absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that
light, which, as the scripture says, was a law to themselves, and
by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to bejust,
though the foundation was not discovered to us: and, secondly,
that still, as we are all clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel
could say to him, Why hast thou formed me thus?

But to return to my new companion. I was greatly delighted
with him, and made it my business to teach him every thing that
was proper to make him useful, handy, and helpful; but espe-
cially to make him speak, and understand me when I spake: and
he was the aptest scholar that ever was; and particularly was so
merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased when he could but
understand me, or make me understand him, that it was very
pleasant to me to talk to him. And now my life began to be so
easy that I began to say to myself, that could I but have been
safe from more savages, I cared not if I was never to remove from
the place while I lived.

After I had been two or three days returned to my castle, I
thought that, in order to bring Friday ofi' from his horrid way of
feeding, and from the relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to
let him taste other flesh; so I took him out with me one morning
to the woods. I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out of my
own flock, and bring him home and dress it: but as I was going,
I saw a she-goat lying down in the shade, and two young kids
sitting by her. I catched hold of Friday, Hold, said I, stand
still; and made signs to him not to stir; immediately I presented
my piece, shot and killed one of the kids. The poor creature,
who had, at.a distance indeed, seen me kill the savage, his enemy,
but did not know or could imagine how it was done, was sensi-
bly surprised, trembled and shook, and looked so amazed, that
I thought he would have sunk down ; he did not see the kid I
shot at, or perc'eive I had killed it, but ripped up his waistcoat
to feel if he was not wounded ; and, as I found, presently thought
I was resolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled down to
me, and, embracing my knees, said a great many things I did
not understand; but I could easily see that the meaning was to
pray me not to kill him.

I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no
harm; and taking him up by the hand, laughed at him, and
pointing to the kid which I had killed, beckoned to him to run
and fetch it, which he did; and while he was wondering and
looking to see how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun
again, and by and by I saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a
tree within shot: so, to let Friday understand a little what I
would do, I called him to me again, pointing at the fowl, which
was indeed a parrot, though I thought it had been a hawk; I say,
pointing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground under
the parrot, to let him see I would make him fall, I made him
understand that I would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly I
fired, and bid him look, and immediately he saw the parrot fall.
He stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had said
to him; and I found he was the more amazed, because he did
not see me put any thing into the gun; but thought there must
be some wonderful fund of death and destruction in that thing,
able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near or far off: and
the astonishment this created in him was such as could not wear
all" for a long time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he
would have worshipped me and my gun: as for the gun itself,
he would not so much as touch it for several days after; but
would speak to it, and talk to it, as if it had answered him, when
he was by himself; which, as I afterwards learned of him, was
to desire it not to kill him.

Well : after his astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed
to him to run and fetch the bird I had shot, which he did, but
staid some time; for the parrot, not being quite dead, had flut-
tered a good way of? from the place where she fell; however he
found her, took her up, and brought her to me; and, as I had
perceived his ignorance about the gun before, I took this advan.
tage to charge the gun'again, and not let him see me do it, that
I might be ready for any other mark that might present; but
nothing more offered at that time: so I brought home the kid;
and the same evening I took the skin off, and cut it out as well'
as I could; and having a pot for that purpose, I boiled or stewed
some of the flesh, and made some very good broth. After I had
begun to eat some, I gave some to my man, who seemed very _
glad of it, and liked it very well ; but that which was strangest
to him, was, to see me at salt with it. He made a sign to me
that the saltwas not good to eat; and putting ;a little into his
own mouth, he seemed to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter
atigwashingh'is mouthwithfreah waterafterit; ontheother
hand, I took some meat in my month without salt, and I pre-
tended to spit and sputter for want of salt, as fast as he had done
at the salt; but it would not do, he would never care for salt with
meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great while, and then but a
very little.

Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth, I was resolved
to feast him the next day with roasting apiece of the kid: this
I did by hanging it before the fire in a string, as I had seen many
people do in England, setting two poles up, one on each side the
fire, and one across the top, and tying the string to the cross
stick, letting the meat turn continually: this Friday admired
very much; but when he came to taste the flesh, he took so
many ways to tell me how well he liked it, that I could not but
understand him ; and at last he told me he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.

The next day I set him to work to beating some corn out, and
sifting it in the manner I used to do, as I observed before; and
hesoon understoodhowto doitaswellas I, especiallyafterhe
had seen what the meaning of it Was, and that it was to make
bread of; for after that I let him see me make my bread, and
bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to do all the
work for me, as well as I could do it myself.

I began now to consider, that having two mouths to M in-
stead of one, I must provide more ground for my harvest, and
plantalargerquantityofoornthan I used to do; soImarked
outalargerpiece ofland,andbeganthe fenceinthesameman--
ner as before, in which Friday not only worked 'very willingly, and
very hard, but did itvery cheerfufly ; and I told him what it was
for, that it was for corn to make more bread, because hewas now
With me, and that I might have enough for him and myselftoo: he
appeared very sensible of that part, and let me know, that he
thought I had much more labour upon me on his account than I
had for myself, and that he would wOrk the harder for me, if I
would tell him what to do.

This was the pleasantest year of all the life I led in this place.
Friday began to talk pretty well, and understand the names of
almost every thing I had occasion to call for, and of every place
I had to send him to, and talked a great deal to me ; so that, in
short, I began now to have some use for my tongue again, which
indeed I had very little occasion for before; that is to say, about
:peedx. Besides the pleasure of talking to him, I had a singular
satisfaction in the fellow himself; his simple unfeigned honesty
appeared to me more and more every day, and I began really to
love the creature; and on his side, I believe he loved me more
than it was possible for him ever to love any thing before.

I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering inclination
to his own country again; and having learned him Englirh so
well that he could answer me almost any questions, I asked him,
whether the nation that he belonged to never conquered in battle ?
At which he smiled, and said, Yes, yes, we always fight the
better ; that is, he meant, always get the better in fight; and so
we began the following discourse. You always fight the better!
said I. How came you to be taken prisoner then, Friday ?

Friday. My nation beat much for all that.

Mam-r. How beat ? if your nation beat them, how came you
to be taken?

Friday. They more many than my nation in the place where
me was; they take one, two, three, and me. My nation over
beat them in the yonder place, where me no was; there my na-
tion take one, two, great thousand.

Matter. But why did not your side recover you from the
hands of your enemies then?

Friday. They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in
the tame ,- my nation have no came that time.

Matter. Well, Friday, and what does your nation do with
the men they take? Do they earrythem away, and eat'them as
thwe did?

Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.

Mater. ' Where do they any them?

Friday. Go to other place where they think.

Matter. Do they come hither?

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither: come other eke place.

Master. Have you been here with them?

Friday. Yes, I been here [point to the N. W. side if the
island, which it seems, was their side]

By this I understood, that my man Friday had formerly been
among the savages who used to come on shore, on the farther
part of the island, on the same man-eating occasions that he was
now brought for ; and some time after when I took the courage
to carry him to that side, being the same I formerly mentioned,
he presently knew the place, and told me, he was there once
when they eat up twenty men, two Women, and one child: he
could not tell twenty in English, but he numbered them by laying
so many stones on a row, and pointed to me to tell them over.

I have told this passage, because it introduces what follows ;--
that after I had had this discourse with him, I asked him how
far it was from our island to the shore, and whether the canoe:
were not often lost? He told me there wm no danger, no came:
ever lost; but that after a little way out to sea, there was a cur-
rent, and wind always one way in'the morning, the other in the
afternoon.

This I understand to be no more than the sets of the tide,
as going out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood it was
oceasioned by the great draught and reflux of the mighty river
Oroonaque; in the mouth, or the gulph, of which river, as I
thought afterwards, our island lay; and this land, which I per-
ceived to the W'. and N. EV. was the great island Trinidad, on
the north point of the mouth of the river: I asked Friday a

K2
thousand questions about the country, the inhabitants, the sea,
the coast, and what nations were near: he told me all he knew
with the greatest openness imaginable. I asked him the names
of the several nations of his sort of people, but could get no other
name than Carib; from whence I easily understood, that these
were the Caribbeer, which our maps place on the part of America
which reaches from the mouth of the river Oroonoqu: to Guinea,
and onwards to St. Mart/m: he told me, that up a great way
beyond the moon, that was, beyond the setting of the moon,
which must be IV. from their country, there dwelt white bearded
men, like me, and pointed to my great whiskers, which I men-
tioned before; and that they had killed mud: mam, that was his
word: by all which I understood he meant the Spaniards, whose
cruelties in flmerica had been spread over the whole countries,
and was remembered by all the nations from father to son.

I inquired if he could tell me how I might come from this
island, and get among those white men: he told me, Yes, yes, I
might go in two tenor,- I could not understand what he meant,
or make him describe to me what he meant by two canoe; till at
last, with great difficulty, I found he meant, that it must be in
a large great boat as big as two canoes.

This part of Friday: discourse began to relish with me very
well ; and from this time I entertained some hopes, that one time
or other I might find an opportunity to make my escape from
this place, and that this poor savage might be a means to help
me to do it.

During the long time that Friday had now been with me, and
that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not
wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind;
particularly, I asked him one time, Who made him ? The poor
creature did not understand me at all, but thought I had asked
who was his father: but I took it by another handle, and asked
him, Who made the sea, the ground he walked on, and the hills
and woods? He told me it was one old Brunette: that lived
beyond all; he could describe nothing of this great person, but that
he was very old; much older, he said, than the sea or the land,
than the moon or the stars. Iaskedhimthen, Ifthis old person
had made all things, why did not all things worship him? He
looked very grave, and with a perfect look of innocence, said,
All thing: do my 0! to In)>>. I asked him if the people who die
in his country went away any-where? He said Yes, they all
went to Benamuckee. Then I asked him, whether those they eat
up went thither too? he said, Yes.

From these things I began to instruct him in the knowledge
of the true Goo. I told him that the great Maker of all things
lived up there, pointing up towards heaven : that he governs the
world by the same power and providence by which he made it;
that he was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give every
thing to us, take every thing from us; and thus, by degrees, I
opened his eyes. He listened with great attention, and received
with pleasure the notion of yew: Clm'rt being sent to redeem us,
and of the manner of making our prayers to Goo, and his being
able to hear us, even into heaven. He told me one day, that if
our Goo could hear us up beyond the sun, he must needs be a
greater Goo than their Bermuda, who lived but a little way
OH", and yet could not hear, till they went up to the great moun-
tains, where he dwelt, to speak to him. I asked him, if ever he
went thither to speak to him ? He said, No, they never went
that were young men; none went thither but the old men; who
he called their Oowookakee, that is, as I made him explain it to
me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went to say 0! (so
he ealled saying prayers), and then eame back, and told them
what Begonia-he said. By this I observed that there is priest--
craft even amongst the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the
world; and the policy of making a secret religion, in order to
preserve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not only to
be found in the Rm, but perhaps among all religions in the
world, even among the most brutish and barbarous savages.

Iendeavouredtoclearupthisfi-audtonrymanFrr'day; and
told him, that the pretence of their old men going up to the
mountains to say 0! to their God anmckee, was a cheat; and
their bringing word from thence what he said, was much more
so; that if they met with any answer, or spoke with any one
there, it must be with an evil spirit: and then I entered into a
long discourse with him about the devil, the original of him, his
rebellion against Goo, his enmity to man, the reason of it, his
setting himself up in the dark pars of the world to be worshipped
instead of Goo, and as G01), and the many stratagems he made
use of to delude mankind to their ruin; how he had a secret
access to our passions and to our affections, to adapt his snares
so to our inclinations, as to cause us even to be our own tempters,
and to run upon our destruction by our own choice.

I found it was not so easy to imprint right notions in his mind
about the devil as it was about the being of a Goo: nature
assisted all my arguments to evidence to him even the necessity
of a great first cause, and over-ruling governing power, a secret
directing Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying
homage to him that made us, and the like: but there appeared
nothing of all this in the notion of an evil spirit; of his original,
his being, his nature, and above all, of his inclination to do evil,
and to draw us in to do so too: and the poor creature puzzled
me once in such a manner, by a question merely natural and
innocent, that l scarce knew what to say to him. I had been
talking a great deal to him of the power of Goo, his omnipo-
tence, his dreadful nature to sin, his being a consuming fire to
the workers of iniquity ; how, as he had made us all, he could
destroy us, and all the world in a moment; and he listened with
great seriousness to me all the while.

After this, I had been telling him how the devil was Goo's
enemyin the heartsofmen,andwdallhismaliceandskillto
defeat thegooddesignsofProvidenoe,andtoruinthekingdom
of Cnnrs'r in the world, and the like: Well, says Friday, but
you sayGou issostrong,sogreat,is he notmuch strong,much
might a the devil? Yes, yes, said I, Friday, Goo is stronger
thanthedevil': Gooisabove thedevil, and therefore we pray to
Gov to tread himdown underourfeet,andenableustoresist
his temptations, and quench his fiery darts. But, says he again,
If God much :trong, much might a: the devil, why God no kill the
devil, :0 make hint no more do wicked ?

I was strangely surprised at his question; and after all, though
Iwas now an old man, yet I was but a young doctor, and ill
enough qualified for a easuist or a solver of difficulties: and, at
first, I could not tell what to say; so I pretended not to hear
him, and asked him what he said? but he was too earnest
for an answer to forget his question: so that he repeated it in
the very same broken words as above. By this time I had re-
covered myself a little, and I said, God will at last punish him
:everely; he is retervedfor the judgment, and i: to he cart into the
hattmleu pit, to dwell with everlarting fire. This did not satisfy
Friday,- but he returns upon me, repeating my words, Reserve
at last! me no understand : but why not kill the devil now, not kill
great ago ? You may as well ask me, raid 1, why Goo does not
kill you and me, when we do wicked things here that offend him:
we are preserved to repent and be pardoned. He muses awhile
at this: Well, well, says he, mighty affectionately, that well; 30
you, I, devil, all wicked, all preeer've, repent, God pardon all.
Here I was rundownagainbyhimto the lastdegree, and itwas
a testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature, though they
will guide reasonable creatures to the knowledge of a Goo, and
of aworship or homage due to the supreme being of Goo, as
the consequence of our nature; yet nothing but divine revela-
tion can form the knowledge of few Chrirt, and of a redemp-
tion purchased for us; of a Mediator; of a new covenant; and
of an Intercessor at the footstool ofGoo's throne: I say nothing
but a revelation from Heaven can form these in the soul; and.
that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour :7:qu Christ,
I mean the word of GOD, and the Spirit of GOD, promised for
the guide and sanctifier of his people, are the absolutely necessary
instructors of the souls of men in the saving knowledge of Goo,
and the means of salvation.

I therefore diverted the present discourse between me and my
man, rising up hastily, as upon some sudden occasion of going
out; then sending him for something a good way of, I seriously
prayed to GOD, that he would enable me to instruct savingly
this poor savage, assisting by his Spirit the heart of the poor
ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge of GOD
in Christ, reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to
speak so to him from the word of Goo, as his conscience might
be convinced, his eyes opened, and his soul saved: when he
came again to me, I entered into a long discourse with him upon
the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour of the world,
and of the doctrine of the Gospel preached from heaven, 'viz. of
repentance towards G00, and faith in our blessed Loan yams,-
I then explained to him, as well as I could, why our blessed
Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
fibre/mm, and how, for that reason, the fallen angels had no share
in the redemption; that he came only to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel, and the like.

I had, God knows, more sincerity than knowledge, in all the
methods I took for this poor creature's instruction; and must
acknowledge what I believe all that act upon the same principle-
will find, that in laying things open to him, I really informed
and instructed myself in many things, that either I did not know,
or had not fully considered before; but which occurred naturally
to my mind, upon my searching into them for the information
ofthis poor savage; and I had more affection in my inquiry
afterthings upon this oeeasion, than ever I felt before: sothat
whether this poor wild wretchwas the better for me or no, I had
great reason tobethankful thateverhecametome: mygrief
sat lighter upon me, my habitation grew comfortable to me be-
yond measure; and when I reflected, that in this solitary life,
which I had been confined to, I had not only been moved myself
to look up to Heaven, and to seek to the hand that had brought
me there, but was now to be made an instrument, under Provi--
dence, to save the life, and, for dug/1t I knew, the soul of a poor
savage, and bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of
the Christian doctrine, that he might know Cmusr Jssus, to
knew when: is life eternal; I say, when I reflected upon all these
things, a secret joy run through every part of my soul, and I
frequently rejoiced that ever I was brought to this place, which
I had so often thought the most dreadful of all afflictions that
could possibly have befallen me.

. In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder of my
time; and the conversation which employed the hours between
Friday and I was such as made the three years which we lived
there together perfectly and completely happy, if my me}: thing
a: complete happiness (an be finned in a :ullunary state. The
savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I; though
I have reason to hope, and bless Goo for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted restored penitents: we had here the
word of Got) to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to in-
structthanifwehadbeenin England.

I always applied myself to reading the Scripture, and to let
him know, as well as I could, the meaning ofwhat I read; and
he again by his serious inquiries and questions, made me, a: I
:4id.6efore, a much better scholar in the Scripture knowledge,
than I should ever have been by my own private mere reading.
another thing I eannot refrain from observing here also, from
experience, in this retired part of my life; viz. how infinite and
inexpressible a blessing it is, that the knowledge of Goo, and of
the doctrine of salvation by Clxrist 7esus, is so plainly laid down
in the word of Goo, so easy to be received and understood, that
as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understand-
ing enough of my duty to carry me directly on to the great work
of sincere repentance for my sins, and laying hold of a Saviour
for life and salvation, to a seated reformation in practice, and
obedience to all GOD'S commands, and this without any teacher
or instructor, (I mean human) so the same plain instruction suf-
ficiently served to the enlightening this savage creature, and
bringing him to be such a Christian as I have known few equal
to him in my life.

As to all the disputes, wranglings, strife and contention, which
has happened in the world about religion, whether niceties in
doctrines, or schemes of church government, they were all per-
fectly useless to us, as, for aught I can yet see, they have been
to all the rest in the world: we had the sure guide to heaven, 'viz.
the word of GOD; and we had, blessed be God ! comfortable views
of the Spirit of Goo, teaching and instructing us by his word,
leading us into all truth, and making us both willing and obedient
to the instruction of his word: and I cannot see the least use
that the greatest knowledge of the disputed points in religion,
which have made such confusions in the world, would have been
to us, if we could have obtained it. But I must go on with the
historical part of things, and take every part in its order.

After Bailey and I became more intimately acquainted, and
that he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak
fluently, though in broken English, to me, I acquainted him
with my own story, or at least so much of it as related to my
coming into the place; howl had lived there, and how long. I

et him into the mystery (for such it was to him) of gunpowder
and bullet, and taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with; and I made him a
belt with a frog hanging to it, such as in England we wear
hangers in; and in the frog, instead of a hanger, I gave hima
hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon in some cases, but
much more useful upon other oceasions.

I described to him the countries of Europe, and particularly
England, which I came from; how we lived, how we worshipped
Goo, how we behaved to one another, and how we traded in
ships to all the parts of the world. I gave him an account of
the wreck which I had been on board of, and shewed him, as
near as I could, the place where she lay; but she was all beaten
in pieces before, and quite gone.

I shewed him the ruins of our boat, which we lost when we
escaped, and which I could not stir with my whole strength then,
but was now fallen almost all to pieces. Upon seeing this boat,
Friday stood musing a great while, and said nothing; I asked
him what it was he studied upon? At last, says he, M: .m such
baa! like come to plate at in] nation.

I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I
had examined farther into it, I understood by him, that a boat,
such as that had been, came on shore upon the country where he
lived, that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by stress of
weather. I presently imagined that some European ship must
have been cast away upon their coast, and the boat might get
loose, and drive ashore ; but was so dull, that I never once thought
of men making escape from a wreck thither, much less whence
they might come; so I only inquired after a description of the
boat.

Friday described the boat to me well enough; but brought
me better to understand him, when he added, with some warmth,
We :41}: the white man: from drown: then I presently asked
him, if there were any white mans, as he ealled them, in the
boat? 2'", he said, the tactful] white man. I asked him, how,
many? he told upon his fingers seventeen. I asked him then,
what became of them? he told me, The] live, the} dwell at my
nation.

This put new thoughts into my head; for I presently ima-
gined, that these might be the men belonging to the ship that
was cast away in sight of my island, as I now all it: and who,
after the ship was struck on the rock, and they saw her inevitably
lost, had saved themselves in their boat, and were landed upon
that wild shore among the savages.

Upon this I inquired of him more critically, what was become
of them? He assured me they lived still there, that they had
been there about four years, that the savages let them alone, and
gave them victuals to eat. I asked him, how it came to pass
they did not kill them, and eat them? he said, No, the} make
hrother with them: that is, as I understood him, a truce: and
then he added, The} no eat man: hat when make the war fight:
that is to say, they never eat any men, but such as come to fight
with them, and are taken in battle.

It was after this some considerable time, that being on the top
of the hill, at the east side of the island, from whence, as I have
said, I had in a clear day discovered the main or continent of
America,- Friday, the weather being very serene, looks very
earnestly towards the main land, and in a kind of surprise falls a
jumping and dancing, and tails out to me, for I was at some
distance from him. I asked him what was the matter? Ojo},
says he, 0 glad! there :ee n9 country, there my nation!

I observed an extraordinary sense of pleasure appeared in his
face, and his eyes sparkled, and his countenance discovered a
strange eagemus, as if he had a mind to be in his own country
again; and this observation of mine put a great many thoughts
into me; which made me at first not so easy about my new man
Friday as I was before; and I made no doubt, but that if Friday
could get back to his own nation again, he would not only forget
all his religion, but all his obligations to me; and would be
forward enough to give his countrymen an account of me, and
come back perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make
a feast upon me, at which he might be as merry as he used to be
with those of his enemies, when they were taken in war.

But I wronged the poor honest creature very much, for which
I was very sorry afterwards: however, as my jealousy increased,
and held me some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before; in which I was cer-
tainly in the wrong too, the honest grateful creature having no
thought about it, but what consisted of the best principles, both
as a religious Christian, and as a grateful friend; as appeared
afterwards, to my full satisfaction.

Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was
every day pumping him, to see if he would discover any of the
new thoughts whichI suspected were in him; but I found every
thing he said was so honest, and so innocent, that I could find
nothing to nourish my suspicion; and, in spite of all my um
easinees, he made me at last entirely his own again; nor did he
in the least perceive that I was uneasy; and therefore I could
not suspect him of deceit.

One day, walking up the same hill, but the weather being
hazy at sea, so that we could not see the continent, I <<lied to
him, and said, Friday, do not you wish yourself in your own
country, your own nation? Yes, he said, he be mud: 0 glad to be
at Iu': own notion. What would you do there? said I: would
you turnwild again, eat men's flesh again: andbeasavageas
you were before? He looked full of concern, and shaking his
head, said, No, no, Friday tell Man to live good, tell them to pro}
God, tell them to rat corn-bread, tattle-flesh, milk, no eat not
again. Why then, said I to him, the} will bill)". He looked
grave at that, and then said, No, the} no kill me, the} willing love
km: he meant by this,theywould be willing tolearn. He
added, they learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat. Then I asked him, if he would go halt to them? He
smiled at that, and told me he could not swim so far. I told
him I would make a canoe for him. He told me 11: would go, if
I would go with him. I go! said 1, why they will eat me if I
come there. No, no, says he, Me make them no eat you, me make
(hey mud: love you: he meant he would tell them how I had
killed his enemies and saved his life, and so he would make them
love me. Then he told me, as well as he could, how kind they
were to seventeen white men, or bearded men, as he called them,
who came on shore there in distress.

From this time, I confess, I had a mind to venture over, and
see if I could possibly join with these bearded men, who, I made
no doubt, were Spaniard: or Portuguese; not doubting but if I
could, we might find some method to escape from thence, being
upon the continent, and a good company together, better than
I could from an island forty miles of? the shore, and alone with-
out help. So, after some days, I took Friday to work again, by
way of discourse; and told him, I would give him a boat to go
back to his own nation; and accordingly I carried him to my
frigate, which lay on the other side of the island; and having
cleared it of water (for I always kept it sunk in the water), I
brought it out, shewed it him, and we both went into it.

I found he was a most dexterous fellow at managing it; would
make it go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when
he was in, I said to him, Well now, Friday, shall we go to your
nation? He looked very dull at my saying so, which it seems,
was because he thought the boat too small to go so far. I told
him then I had a bigger: so the next day I went to the place
where the first boat lay whichI had made, but which I could not
get into the water; he said that was big enough; but then, as I
had taken no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-twenty
years there, the sun had split and dried it, that it was in a man-v
net rotten. Friday told me, such a boat would do very well,
and would earry much enough nittle, drink, hread; that was his
way of talking.

Upon the whole, I was by this time so fixed upon my design
of going over with him to the continent, that I told him we
would go and make one as big as that, and he should go home in
it. He answered not one word, but looked very grave and sad.
I asked him, what was the matter with him? He asked me again
thus, Why you angry rnad with Friday? what one done? I asked
him what he meant? I told him I was not angry with him at all.
No angry, no angry! says he, repeating the words several times.
Why send Friday home away to my nation 1? Why, said 1, Friday,
did you not say you wished you were there? 1' es, yes, says he,
wish he hath there; no wish Friday there, no master there. In a
word, he would not think of going there without me. I go
there, Friday! said I, what should I do there? He turned very
quick upon me at this. You do great deal much good, says he,
you teach wild mans he good, soher, tame tnans; you tell then: know
God, pray God, and five new life. Alas, Friday, said I, that
hnowest not what thou sayest; I an: hut an ignorant man myself.
2" es, yes, says he, you tees/tee me good, you teeehee then: good. No,
no, Friday, said I, you shall go without one; leave me here to live
hy nyself, as I did hefore. He looked confused again at that
word, and running to one of the hatchet: which he used to wear,
he takes it up hastily, comes and gives it me. What "It"! I do
with this ? says I to him. You take hill Friday, says he. What
must I kill you for? said I again. He returns very quick, Mat
you send Friday away for? Take kill Friday, no send Friday
away. This he spoke so earnestly, that I saw tears stand in his
eyes. In a word, I so plainly discovered the utmost affection in
him to me, and a firm resolun'on in him, that I told him then,
and often after, that I would never send him away from me, if
he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his discourse a'settled
affection to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so
I found all the foundation of his desire to go to his own country
was laid in his ardent affection to the people, and his hopes of
my doing them good; a thing which as I had no notion of my-
self, so I had not the least thought, or intention, or desire of
undertaking it: but still I found a strong inclination to my
attempting an escape, as above, founded on the supposition ga-
thered from' the discourse; 'viz. that there were seventeen bearded
men there: and therefore, without any more delay, I went to
work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper to fell, and
make a large periagua or canoe, to undertake the voyage. There
were trees enough in the island to have built a little fleet, not of
periaguas and canoes only, but even of good large vessels: but
the main thing I looked at, was to get one so near the water, that
we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the mistake I
committed at first.

At last Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he knew
much better than I what kind of wood was fittest for it; nor
can I tell to this day what wood to call the tree we cut down,
except that it was very like the tree we call furtic, or between
that and the Nitaragua wood, for it was much of the same colour
and smell. Friday was for burning the hollow or mvity of this
tree out, to make it into a boat: but I shewed him how rather
to cut it out with tools, which after I shewed him how to use,
he did very handily; and in about a month's hard labour we
finished it, and made it very handsome, especially when, with
our axes, which I shewed him how to handle, we cut and hewed
the outside into the true shape of a boat. After this, however,
it cost us near a fortnight's time to get her along, as it were inch
by inch, upon great rollers into the water; but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty men with great ease.

When she was in the water, and though she was so big, it
amazed me to seewithwhat dexterity and how swift myman
Friday would manage her, turn her, and paddle her along; so I
asked him if he would, and if we might venture over in her?
2'93, he said, he venture over in her very well, though great blow
wind : however, I had a farther design that he knew nothing of,
and thatwas to make a mast and sail, and to fit hcrwith an
anchor and cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get;
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar-tree, which I found near
the place, and which there was a great plenty of in the island;
and I set Friday to work to cut it down, and gave him direc-
tions how to shape and order it: but as to the sail, that was my
particular care; I knewI had old sails or rather pieces of old
sails enough; but as I had had them now twenty-six years by
me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not ima-
gining that I should ever have this kind of use for them, I did
not doubt but they were all rotten; and indeed most of them
were so: however, I found two pieces which appeared pretty
good, and with these I went to work, and with a great deal of
pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be sure) for want
of needles, I at length made a three-cornered ugly thing, like
what we call in England a shoulder-of-mutton sail, to go with a
boom at bottom, and a little short sprit at the top, such as usually
our ships long-boats sail with, and such as I best knew how to
manage; because it wassuch a one as I hadtotheboatinwhich
I made my escape from Barhary, as related in the first part of
my story.

I was near two months performing this last work; viz. rig-
ging and fitting mymast and sails; for I finished them very
complete, making a small stay, and a sail or forcmil to it, to
assist, if we should turn to windward; and, which was more than
all, I fixed a ruddertothe stern ofher,tosteerwith; and
though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet, as I knew the
usefulness, and even necessity of such a thing, I applied myself
with so much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass,
though, considering the many dull contrivances I had for it that
failed, I think it cost me almost as much labour as making the
boat.

After all this was done, I had my man Friday to teach as
to what belonged to the navigation of my boat; for though he
knew very well how to paddle the canoe, he knew nothing what
belonged to a sail and a rudder, and was the more amazed when
he saw me work the boat to-and-again in the sea by the rudder,
and how the sail gybed, and filled this way or that way, as the
course we sailed changed; I say, when he saw this, he stood like
one astonished and amazed; however, with a little use, I made
all these things familiar to him, and he became an expert sailor,
except that as to the compass I could make him understand very
little of that: on the other hand, as there was very little cloudy
weather, and seldom or never any fogs in those parts, there was
the less occasion for a compass, seeing the stars were always to
be seen by night, and the shore by day, except in the rainy sea--
sons; and then nobody cared to stir abroad, either by land or sea.

I was now entered on the seven-and-twentieth year of my cap-
tivity in this place; though the three last years that I had this
creature with me ought rather to be left out of the account, my
habitation being quite of another kind than in all the rest of my
time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here with the same
thankfulness to Goo for his mercies as at first; and if I had such
cause of acknowledgment at first, I had much more so now, hav-
ing such additional testimonies of the care of Providence over
me, and the great hopes I had of being effectually and speedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon my thoughts,
that my deliverance was at hand, and that I should not be ano-
ther year in this place: however, I went on with my husbandry,
digging planting, fencing, as usual; I gathered and cured my
grapes, and did every necessary thing, as before.
The rainy season was in the meantime upon me, when I kept
morewithindoors than atother times: so Ihad stowedour new
vessel as acute as we could, bringing her up into the creek,
where, as I said in the beginning, I landed my rafts from the
ship; and haling her up to the shore, at high water mark, 'I
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big enough to hold
her, and just deep enough to give her water to float in; and
then, when the tide was out, we made a strong dam cross the
end of it, to keep the water out; and so she lay dry, as to the
tide, from the sea; and to keep the rain of, we laid a great
many boughs of trees so thick, that she was as well thatched as
a house; and thus we waited for the months of November and
Dartmoor, in which I designed to make my adventure.

When the settled season began to come in, as the thought of
my design returned with the fair weather, I was preparing daily
forthevoyage; andthefirstthingldidwas tolay byacertain
quantity of provision, being the stores for the voyage; and
intended, in a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and
launch out our boat. I was busy one morning upon something
of this kind, when I ealled to Friday, and bid him go to the sea-
shore, and see if he could find a turtle or tortoise, a thing which
we generally got once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well
as the flesh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or fence, like one
that felt not the ground, or the steps he set his feet on; and
before I had time to speak to him, he criesouttome, Omar!
0 water! 0 sorrow! 0 bad! What's the matter, Friday? said
I. O yonder there, says he, om, two, three mm! one, two, three!
By his way of speaking I concluded there 'were six; but on
inquiry I found there were but three. Well, Friday, said I, do
notbefi-ighted;solheartenedhimupaswellasloould.
However, I saw the poor fellow was most terribly seamed; for

him, and would cut him in pieces, and eat him, and' the poor
fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to do with him: I
comforted him as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him: but,
said I, Friday, we must resolve to fight them: Can you fight,
Friday .? Me :hoot, says he, hut there come many great number.
No matter for that, said I again, our guns will fright them that
we do not kill. So I asked him, whether, if I resolved to defend
him, he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bid
him? He said, Me die, when you hid die, matter; so I went
and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave him ; for I had been
so good a husband of my rum, that I had a great deal left:
when he had drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces
which we always carried, and load them with large swan--shot as
big as small pistol-bullets; then I took four muskets, and loaded
them with two slugs, and five small bullets each; and my two
pistols I loaded with a brace of bullets each: I hung my great
sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my perspective
glass, and went up to the side of the hill, to see what I could
discover; and I found quickly, by my glass, that there were
one-and-twenty savages, three prisoners, and three cancer; and
that their whole business seemed to be the triumphant banquet
upon these three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed, but
nothing else more than as I had observed was usual with them.
I observed also, that they were landed, not where they had
done when Friday made his esmpe, but nearer to my creek,
where the shore was low, and where a thick wood me close
almost down to the sea: this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman
errand these wretches came about, filled me with such indignation,
that I came down again to Friday, and told him, I was resolved
to go down to them, and kill them all; and asked him if he
would stand by me. He was now gotten over his fright, and
his spirits being a little raised with the dram I had given him,.
he was very cheerful; and told me, as before, he would die when
I bid die.

In this fit. of fury, I took first and divided the arms which I
had charged, as before, between us; I gave Friday one pistol to
stick in his girdle, and three guns upon his shoulder; and I took
one pistol, and the other three myself; and in this posture we
marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in my pocket, and
gave Friday a large bag with more powder and bullet; and as
to orders, I charged him to keep close behind me, and not to
stir, or shoot, or do any thing till I bid him; and in the mean-
time, not to speak a word: in this posture I fetched a compass
to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over the creek as
to get into the wood; so that I might come within shoot of them
before I could be discovered, which I had seen by my glass it
was easy to do.

While I was making this march, my former thoughts returning,
I began to abate my resolution; I do not mean, that I enter-
tained any fear of their number; for a they were naked, unarmed
wretches, it is certain I was superior to them; nay, though I had
been alone: but it occurred to my thoughts, what call, what
occasion, much less what necessity Iwas in, to go and dip my
hands in blood, to attack people who had neither done or intended
me any wrong; who, as to me, were innocent, and whose bar-
barous customs were their own disaster, being in them a token
indeed of Gon's having left them, with the other nations of that
part of the world, to such stupidity and to such inhuman courses;
but did not all me to take upon me to be ajudge of their
acu'ons, much less an executioner of his justice; that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the cause into his own hands, and
by national vengeance punish them, as a people, for national
crimm; but that in the meantime, it was none of my business:
that it was true, Friday might justify it, beause he was a
declared enemy, and in a state of war with those very particular
people, and it was lawful for him to attack them; but I could
not say the same with respect to me. These things were so
warmly pressed upon my thoughts all the way as I went, that I
resolved I would only go and place myself near them, that I
might observe their barbarous feast, and that I would act then
as Goo should direct; but that unless something offered that
was more a call to me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle
with them.

With this resolution I entered the wood, and with all possible
wariness and silence (Friday following close at my heels) I
marched till I came to the skirt of the wood, on the side which
was next to them; only that one comer of the wood lay between
me and them: here I called softly to Friday, and shewing him
a great tree, which was just at the corner of the wood, I bade
him go to the tree, and bring me word if he could see there
plainly what they were doing: he did so, and came immediately
back to me, and told me they might be plainly viewed there;
that they were all about the fire, eating the flesh of one of their
prisoners; and that another lay bound upon the sand, 3. little
from them, which he said they would kill next, and which fired
all the very soul within me. He told me, it was not one of
their nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had told me
of, that came to their country in the boat. I was filled with
horror at the very naming the white-bearded man, and, going to
the tree, I saw plainly, by my glass, a white man, who lay upon
the beach of the sea, with his hands and his feet tied with flags,
or things like rushes; and that he was an European, and had
clothes on. '

There was another tree, and a little thicket'beyond it, about
fifty yards nearer to them than the place where I was, which, by
going a little way about, I saw I might come at undiscovered,
and that then I should be within half shot of them; so I with-
held my passion, though I was indeed enraged to the highest
degree: and going back about twenty paces, I got behind some
bushes, which held all the way till I came to the other tree, and
then I came to a little rising ground, which gave me a full view
of them, at the distance of about eighty yards.

I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen of the dreadful
wretches sat upon the ground all close huddled together, and had
just sent the other two to butcher the poor Chrim'an, and bring
him, perhaps limb by limb, to their fire; and they were stooped
down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Friday ; Now,
Friday, said I, do as I bid thee. Friday said, he would. Then,
Friday, says I, do exactly as you see me do; fail in nothing. So
I set down one of the muskets and the fowling--piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with the other
musket I took my aim at the savages, bidding him do the like.
Then asking him if he was ready, he said, Yes. Then lire at
them, said I; and the same moment I fired also.

Friday took his aim so much better than I, that on the side
that he shot, he killed two of them, and wounded three more;
and on my side, I killed one, and wounded two. They were,
you may be sure, in a dreadful consternation: and all of them,
who were not hurt, jumped up upon their feet, but did not imme-
diately know which way to run, or which way to look; for they
knew not from whence their destruction came. Friday kept his
eyes close upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe
whatIdid; soassoonasthefirstshotwasmade,lthrewdown
the piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did the
like: he sees me cock, and present; he did the same again.
Are you ready, Friday ? said I. Yes, says he. Let fly then,
saidl,inthenameofGong andwiththat I fired againamoag
the anuzed wretches, and so did Friday; and as our pieces'w'ete
now loaden with what I called swan-shot, or small pistol-bullets,
we found only two drop; but so many were wounded, that they
ran about yelling and screaming like mad creatures, all bloody,
and miserably wounded most of them; whereof three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.

Now F riday, says I, laying down the discharged pieces, and
taking up the musket, which was yet loaden, follow me, says I;
which he did, with a great deal of courage; upon which I rushed
out of the wood, and showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot: as soon as I perceived they saw me, I shouted as loud as
I could, and bade Friday do so too; and running as fast as I
could, which by the way was Mt 7;er fast, being loader with
arm; a: I was, I made directly towards the poor victim, who
was, as I said, lying upon the beach or shore, between the place
where they sat and the sea; the two butchers, who were just
going to work with him, had left him, at the surprise of our first
fire, and fled in a terrible fright to the sea-side, and hadjumped
into a range, and three more of the rest made the same way: I
turned to Friday, and bid him step forwards, and fire at them;
he understood me immediately, and running about forty yards to
be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had killed them
all; for I see them all fall ofa heap into the boat, though I saw
two of them up again quickly: however he killed two of them,
and wounded the third, so that he lay down in the bottom of the
boat, as if he had been dead.

While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out my knife,
and cut the flags that bound the poor victim; and loosing his
hands and feet I lifted him up, and asked him in the Portuguese
tongue, what he was? He answered in Latin, Christiana: ; but
wassoweakand faint,that he couldsearce stand,orspeak; Imok
my bottle out of my pocket, and gave it him, making signs that
he should drink, which he did;de gave him a piece of brad,
which he eat; then I asked him, what countryman he was? and
he said, Bragnale; and, being a little recovered, let me know,
by all the signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my
debt for his deliverance. Seiguior, said I, with as much Spanish
aleouldmakeup,wewilltalkafterwards,butwe mistfight
now: if you have any strength left, take this pistol and sword,
and lay about you : he took them very thankfully, and no sooner
hadhethearmsinhishands,butasiftheyhadputnewvigour
into him, he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had cut
two of them in pieces in an instant; for the truth is, as the whole
wasasurprisetothem,sothepoorcreatureaweresomuch
frighted with the noise of our pieces, that they fell down for
mere amazement and fear, and had no more power to attempt
their own eseape, than their fleahhadtoreaistourshot; andthat
was the ease of those five that Friday shot at in the boat; for as
three of them fell with the hurt they received, so the other two
fell with the fright.

I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being willing
to keep my charge ready, beans: I had given the Spaniard my
pistol and sword: so I called to Friday, and had him run up to
the tree from whence we first fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there, that had been discharged, which he did with great swift-
nees; and then giving him my musket, I sat down myselfto
load all the rest again, and bade them come to me when they
wanted. While I was loading these pieces, there happened a
fierce engagement between the Spaniard and one of the savages,
who made at him with one of their great wooden swords, the
same weapon that was to have killed him before, if I had not
prevented it. The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave as
could be imagined, though weak, had fought this Indian a good
while,andhadcuthimtwogreatwoundson hishead; buttlie
savage, being a stout lusty fellow, closing in with him, lfid
thrown him down (being faint), and was wringing my sword

'out of his hand, when the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely
quitting hissword, drew the pistol fromhisgirdle,shot the
savagethroughthebody, andkilled him upon the spogbefore'
l, whomrunningto helphim, could come nearhim.

Friday, being now left at his liberty, pursued the flying
wretches with no weapon in his hand but his hatchet; and with
that he dispatched those three, who, as I said before, were
wounded at first, and fallen, and all the rest he could come up
with; and the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him
one of the fowling pieces, with which he pursued two of the
savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to
run, they both got from him into the wood, where Friday
pursued them, and killed one of them; but the other was too
nimble for him; and though he was wounded, yet had plunged
himself into the sea, and swam with all his might of? to those
two who were left in the (aim, which three in the canoe, with one
wounded, who we know not whether he died or no, were all
that escaped our hands of one-and--twenty. The account of the
rest is as follows:

3 Killed at our shot from the tree.

2 Killed at the next shot.

2 Killed by Friday in the boat.

2 Killed by ditto, of those at first wounded.

I Killed by ditto, in the wood.

3 Killed by the Spaniard.

4. Killed, being found dropped here and there of their wounds,

or killed by Friday in his chase of them.
4. Escaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if not dead.

21 in all.

 

 

 

 

Those that were in the canoe, worked hard to get out of gun--
shot; and though Friday made two or three shot at them, I did
not find that he hit any of them. Friday would fain have had
me take one of their canoes, and pursue them; and indeedl was
very anxious about their mpe, lest carrying the news home to
their people, they should come back, perhaps, with two or three
hundred of their canoes, and devour us by mere multitude; so I
consented to pursue them by sea; and running to one oftheir
causes, Ijumped in, and bade Friday follow me; but when I
was in the canoe, I was surprised to find another poor creature
lie there alive, bound hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for
the slaughter, and almost dead with fear, not knowing what the
matter was; for he had not been able to look up over the side of
the boat, he was ded so hard, neck and heels, and had been t'nd
so long, that he had really little life in him.

I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes, which they had
bound him with, and would have helped him up; but he could
not stand, or speak, but groaned most piteously, believing, it
seems, still, that he was only unbound in order to be killed.

When Friday came to him, I bade him speak to him, and tell
him of his deliverance; and pulling out my bottle, made him
give the poor wretch a dram, which, with the news of his being
delivered, revived him, and he sat up in the boat; but when
Friday eame to hear him speak, and look in his face, it would
have moved any one to tears, to have seen how Friday kissed
him, embraced him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed,
jumped about, danced, sung, then cried again, wrung his hands,
beat his own face and head, and then sung and jumped about
again like a distracted creature. It was a good while before I
could make him speak to me, or tell me what was the matter;
but when he came a little to himself, he told me that it was his
father.

It was not easy for me to express how it moved me, to see
what eestasy and filial affection had worked in this poor savage,
at the sight of his father, and of his being delivered from death;
nor indeed can I describe half the extravagancies of his affection
after this; for he went into the boat and out of the boat a great
many times: when he went in to him, he would sit down by
him, open his breast, and hold his father's head close to his
bosom half'a'n hour together, to nourish it; then he took his
arms and ankles, which were numbed and 363' with the binding,-

L 225o LIFE AND Amateur":

and chafed and rubbed them with his hands; and I, perceiving
what the case was, gave him some rum out of my bottle to rub
them with, which did them a great dal of good.

This action put an end to our pursuit of the canoe with the
other savages, who were now gotten almost out of sight; and it
was happy for us that we did not; fOr it blew so hard within
two hours after, and before they could be gotten a quarter of
their way, and continued blowing so hard all night, and that from
the north-we", which was against them, that I could not suppose
their boat could live, or that they ever reached to their own
coast.

But to return to Friday; he was so busy about his father,
that I could not find in my heart to take him oil" for some time :
but after I thought he could leave him a little, I called him to
me, and he came jumping and laughing, and pleased to the
highest extreme. Then I asked him, if he had given his father
any bread? He shook his head, and said, None: ugly dog eat
all up self. So I gave him a cake of bread out of a little pouch
I carried on purpose; I also gave him a dram for himself, but he
would not taste it, but carried it to his father. I had in my
pocket also two or three bunches of my raisins, so I gave him a
handful of them for his father. He had no sooner given his
father these raisins, but I saw him come out of the boat, and run
away as if he had been bewitched. He run at such a rate (for
he was the swiftest fellow of his foot that ever I saw), I say, he
run at such a rate, that he was out of sight, as it were, in an in--
stant; and though I called and hallooed too after him, it was all
one ; away he went, and in a quarter of an hourI saw him come
back again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came
nearer, I found his pace was slacker, because he had something
in his hand.

When he came up to me, I found he had been quite home for
an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his father some fresh water; and
that he had got two more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread
he gave me, but the water he earried to his father: however, as
I was very thirsty too, I took a little sup of it: this water revived
his father more than all the rum or spirits I had given him; for
he was just fainting with thirst.

When his father had drank, I ealled to him, to know if there
was any water left; he said, Yes; and I bade him give it to the
poor Spaniard, who was in as much want of it as his father; and
I sent one of the cakes, that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon
a green place, under the shade of a tree, and whose limbs were
also very still", and very much swelled with the rude bandage he
had been tied with: when I saw that upon Friday's coming to
him with the water, he sat up and drank, and took the bread,
and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a handful of rai-
sins; he looked up in my face, with all the tokens of gratitude
and thankfulness that could appear in any countenance; but was
so weak, notwithstanding he had so exerted himself in the fight,
that he could not stand up upon his feet; he tried to do it two
or three times, but was really not able, his ankles were so swelled
and so painful to him; so I bade him sit still, and caused Friday
to rub his ankles, and bathe them with rum, as he had done his
father's.

I observed the poor affectionate creature every two minutes,
or perhaps less, all the while he was here, turned his head about,
to see if his father was in the same place and posture as he left
him sitting: and at last he found he was not to be seen ; at which
he star-ad up, and, without speaking a word, flew with that
swiftness to him, that one could searce perceive his feet to touch
the ground as he went: but when he came, he only found he had
laid hiinsclf down to ease his limbs: so Friday came back to me
presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help
him up, if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he should\
'
n
made, how like a king I looked: first of all the whole country
was my own mere property; so that I had an undoubted right
of dominion; 2d.{y, My people were perfectly subjected. I was
absolute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to me, and
were ready to lay down their lives, if there had been occasion for
it, for me'; it was remarkable too, I had but three subjects, and
they were of three difi'erent religions. My man Friday was a
protestant, his father a pagan and a cannibal ; and the Spaniard
was a papist: however, I allowed liberty of conscience through-
out my dominions: but this is by the way.

As soon as I had secured my two weak rescued prisoners, and
given them shelter, and a place to rest them upon, I began to
think of making some provision for them; and the first thing I
did, I ordered Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and
a goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed: when I cut off
the hinder quarter, and, chopping it into small pieces, I set Fri--
day to work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very good
dish, I assure you, of flesh and broth; having put some barley
and rice also into the broth, and as I cooked it without doors
(for I made no fire within my inner wall) so I carried it all into
the new tent ; and having set a table there for them, I sat down
and eat my dinner also with them; and, as well as I could,
cheered them and encouraged them, F riday being my interpreter,
especially to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too: for the
Spaniard spoke the language of the savage: pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather supped, I ordered Friday to
take one of the canoes, and go and fetch our musquets and other
fire-arms, which for want of time, we had left upon the place of
battle; and the next day I ordered hiin to gotand bury the dead
bodies of the savages, which lay open to the sun, and would pre-
sently be offensive; and I also ordered him to bury the horrid
remains of their barbarous feast, which I knew were pretty much,
and which I couldnot think of doing myself; nay, I could not
bear to see them, if I went that way; all which he punctually.
performed, and defaced the very appearance of the worry: being
there; so that when I went again, I could scarce know where it
was, otherwise than by the corner of the wood pointing to the
place.

I then began to enter into a little conversation with my two
new subjects ; and first I set Friday to inquire of his father, what
he thought of the escape of the savage: in that canoe ? and whether
we might expect a return of them with a power too great for us
to resist? His first opinion was, that the savages in the boat
never could live out the storm which blew that night they went
off, but must of necessity be drowned or driven south to those
other shores, where they were as sure to be devoured, as they
were to be drowned if they were cast away; but as to what they
would do if they came safe on shore, he said he knew not : but
it was his opinion, that they were so dreadfully frighted with the
manner of their being attacked, the noise, and the fire, that he
believed they would tell their people they were all killed by thun--
der and lightning, not by the hand of man; and that the two which
appeared (viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly spirits or furies
come down to destroy them, and not men with weapons. .This,
he said, he knew, because he heard them all cry out so in their
language to one another; for it was impossible for them to con-
ceive that a man should dart fire, and speak thunder, and kill at
a distance, without lifting up the hand, as was done now. And
this old savage was in the right, for, as I understood since by other
hands, the savages never attempted to go over to the island after-
wards. They were so terrified with the accounts given by those
four men (for it seems they did escape the sea), that they believed
whoever went to that enchanted island would be destroyed with
fire from the gods.

This, however, I knew not, and therefore was under continual

apprehensions for a good while, and kept always upon my guard, ..
I and all my army; for aswewere nowfourofus, I wouldhave
ventured upon a hundred of them fairly in the open field at any
time.

In a little time, however, no more eanoea appearing, the fear
of their coming wore off, and I began to take my former thoughts
of a voyage to the main into consideration, being likewise
assured by Friday': father, that I might depend upon good usage
from their nation on his account, if I would go.

But my thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a serious
discoune with the Spaniard, and when I understood, that there
were sixteen more of his countrymen and Portugueu, who having
been east away, and made their eseape to that side, lived there at
peace indeed with the savages, but were very sore put to it for
necessaries, and indeed for life. I asked him all the particulars
of their voyage, and found they were a Spanish ship bound from
the Rio de la Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave their
loading there, which was chiefly hides and silver, and to bring
back what European goods they could meet with there; that they
had five Pbrtuglme seamen on board, who they took out of ano-
ther wreck; that five of their own men were drowned when first
the ship was lost; and that these eseaped through infinite dangers
and hazards, and arrived almost starved on the Cannibal coast,
where they expected to have been devoured every moment.

He told me, they had some arms with them, but they were
perfectly useless, for that they had neither powder or ball, the
washing of the sea having spoiled all their powder, but a little
which they used at their first landing to provide themselves some
food.
I asked him what he thought would become of them there;
and if they had formed no design of making any eseape? He
said, they had many consultations about it; but that having
neither'vessel, or tools to build one, or provisions of any kind,
theireounselsalwaysendedinwarsanddespair.
I asked him how he thought they would receive a proposal
from me, which might tend towards an escape; and whether, if they
were all here, it might not be done ? I told him with freedom,
I feared mostly their treachery and ill--usage of me, if I put my
life in their hands; for that gratitude was no inherent virtue in
the nature of man? nor did men always square their dealings by
the obligations they had received, so much as they did by the
advantages they expected. I told him, it would be very hard,
that I should be the instrument of their deliverance, and that
they should afterwards make me their prisoner in New Spain,
where an Englishman was certain to be made a sacrifice, what
necessity, or what accident soever, brought him thither; and that
I had rather be delivered up to the ravages, and be devoured
alive, than fall into the merciless claws of the priests, and be car-
ried into the inquisition. I added, that otherwise I was persuaded,
if they were all here, we might, with so many hands, build a
bark large enough to carry us all away either to the BraJils.
southward, or to the islands or Spanish coast northward: but
that if in requital they should, when I had put weapons into their
hands, carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill
used for my kindness to them, and make my case worse than it
was before.

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuity, that
their condition was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it,
that he believed they would abhor the thought of using any man
unkindly that should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if
I pleased, he would go to them with the old man, and discourse
with them about it, and return again, and bring me their answer:
that he would make conditions with them upon their solemn
oath, that they should be absolutely under my leading, as their
commander and captain; and that they should swear upon the-
holy sacraments and the gospel, to be true to me, and go to such'
christian country as that I should agree to, and no other; and to'
be directed 'wholly and absolutely by my orders, till they were
landed safely in such country as I intended; and that he would
bring a contract from them under their hands for that purpose.

Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself, that he
would never stir from me as long as he lived, till I gave him
orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his
blood, if there should happen the least breach of faith among his
countrymen.

He told me, they were all of them very civil honest men, and
they were under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither
weapons or clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discre--
tion of the ravages; out of all hopes of ever returning to their
own country; and that he was sure, if I would undertake their
relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them,
if possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to
them to treat: but when he had gotten all things in readiness to
go, the Spaniard himself started an objection, which had so much
prudence in it on one hand, and so much sincerity on the other
hand, that I could not but be very well satisfied in it; and, by
his advice, put off the deliverance of his comrades for at least
half a year. The case was thus:

He had been with us now about a month; during which time
I had let him see in what manner I had provided, with the assist-
ance of Providence, for my support; and he saw evidently what
stock of corn and rice I had lain up; which, as it was more
than sufficient for myself, so it was not suflicient, at least with-
out good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to
nlunber four: but much less would it be suflicient, if his coun-
trymen, who were, as he said, fourteen still alive, should come
over; and least of all would it be sufficient to victual our vessel,
if we should build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian colo-
nies of America. So he told me he thought it would be more
advisable, to let him and the two other dig and cultivate some
more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow; and that
we should wait another harvest, that we might have supply of
corn for his countrymen when they should come; for want
might be a temptation to them to disagree, or not to think them-
selves delivered, otherwise than out of one difficulty into another.
You know, says he, the children of Irma], though they rejoiced
at first at their being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even
against Goo himself, that delivered them, when they came to
want bread in the wilderness.

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I
could not but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well asI
was satisfied with his fidelity : so we fell to digging, all four of
us, as well as the wooden tools we were furnished with permitted;
and in about a month's time, by the end of which it was seed-
time, we had gotten as much land cured and trimmed up as we
sowed twenty--two bushels of barley on, and sixteen jars of rice,
which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare; nor indeed
did we leave ourselves barley sufficient for our own food for the
six months that we had to expect our crop, that is to say, reckon-'-
ing from the time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not
to be supposed it is six months in the ground in the country.

Having now society enough, and our number being sufficient
to put us out of fear of the ravages, if they had come, unless
their number had been very great, we went freely all over the
island, wherever we found occasion; and as here we had our
escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at
least for me, to have the means of it out of mine; to this purpose,
I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our work, and
I set Friday and his father to cutting them down; and then I
caused the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thought on that
afi'air, to oversee and direct their work: I shewed them with
what indefatigable pains I had hewed a large tree into single
planks, and I mused them to do the like, till they had made
about a dozen large planks of good oak, near two foot broad,
thirty-five foot long, and from two inches to four inches thick:
what prodigious labour it took up, any one may imagine.

- At the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of
me goats as much as I could; and to this purpose I made Fri-
day and the Spaniard to go out one day, and myself, with Friday,
the next day, for we took our turns: and by this means we got
above twenty young kids to breed up with the rest: for when-
ever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to our
flock: but above all, the season for curing the grapes coming
on, I caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the
sun, that I believe, had we been at Alicaut, where the raisins of
the sun are cured, we should have filled sixty or eighty barrels}
and these, with our bread, was a great part of our food, and very
good living too, I assure you; for it is an exceeding nourishing
food.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not
the most plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however,
it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty--two bushels
of barley, we brought in and threshed out above two hundred
and twenty bushels: and the like in proportion of the rice, which
was store enough for our food to the next harvest, though all
the sixteen Spaniard: had been on shore with me; or, if we had
been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled
our ship, to have earried us to any part of the world, that is to
say, of America. When we had thus housed and secured our

magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-work;
viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was
very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that
I did not make some things for defence of this kind of work:
but I saw no need of it. And now, having a full supply of food
for all the guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with those he left be-
hind him there. I gave him a strict charge in writing, not to
bring any man with him, who would not first swear, in the pre-
sence of himself and the old ravage, that he would no way injure,-
fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who
was so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance; but
that they would stand by and defend him against all such attempts;
and wherever they went, would be entirely under, and subjected
to his commands; and that this should be put in writing, and
signed with their hands: how we were to have this done, when
I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was a question
which we never asked.

Under these instructions, the Spaniard, and the old ravage
(the father of Friday) went away in one of the canoes, which
they might be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when
they came as prisoners to be devoured by the ravages.

I gave each of them a musket with a firelock on it, and about
eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very good
husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon urgent
occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by
me in view of my deliverance for now 27 years and some days;
I gave them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient
for themselves for many days, and sufficient for their countrymen
for about eight days' time; and wishing them a good voyage, I
see them go, agreeing with them about a signal they should hang
out at their return, by which I should know them again, when
they came back, at a distance, before they came on shore.

They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon
was at full; by my account in the month of October; but as for
an exact reckoning of days, after I had once lost it, I could never
recover it again; nor had I kept even the number of years so
punctually, as to be sure that I was right, though as it proved
when I afterwards examined my account, I found I had kept a
true reckoning of years.

It m no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a
strange and unforeseen accident intervened of which the like has
not, perhaps, been heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my
hutch one morning, when my man Friday came running in to
me, and called aloud, Master, Master, they are come, they are
come.

Ijumped up, and, regardless of danger, I went out as soon as
I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which (by
the way) was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; I
say, regardless of danger, I went without my arms, which was
not my custom to do; but I was surpriwd, when turning my
eyes to the sea, I presently saw a boat at about a league and a
half's distance, standing in for the shore, with a shoulder qf nu!-
ton rail, as they call it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring
them in : also I observed presently, that they did not come from
that side which the shore lay on, but from the southermost end
of the island. Upon this I called Friday in, and bid him lie
close, for these were not the people we looked for, and that we
might not know yet whether they were friends or enemies.

In the next place, I went in to fetch my perspective glass, to
see what I could make of them; and having taken the ladder
out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to do when I
was apprehensive of any thing, and to take my view the plainer
without being discovered.

I had scarce set my foot on the hill, when my eye plainly dis-
covered a ship lying at an anchor, at about two leagues and a half's
distance from me, S. S. E., but not above a leagueand a half
from the shore. By my observation it appeared plainly to be an
Englirl: ship, and the boat appeared to be an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of
seeing a ship, and one whom I had reason, to believe was manned
by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as
I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung about
me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep upon
my guard. In the first place it occurred to me to consider what
business an Englirlz ship could have in that part of the world;
since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where
the English had any trafi'ick; and I knew there had been no
storms to drive them in there, as in distress; and that if they>>
were Englirl: really, it was most probable that they were here
upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I was,
than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger,
which sometimes are given him when he may think there is no
possibility of its being real. That such hints and notices are
given us, I believe few that have made any observations of things
can deny ; that they are certain discoveries of an invisible world,
and a converse of spirits, we cannot doubt; and if the tendency
of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why should we not
suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme,
or inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they
are given for our good? '

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of
this reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret
admonition, come it from whence it will, I had been undone
inevitably, and in a far worse condition than before, as you will
see presently.

I had not kept myself long in this posture, but I saw the boat
draw near the shore, as if they looked for a creek to thrust in at
for the convenience of landing; however, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet where I for-
merly landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the
beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very happy for
me; for otherwise they would have landed just, asI may say, at
my door, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and
perhaps, have plundered me of all I had.

When they were on shore, I was fully satisfied they were
Englirhmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were
Duteh, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven men,
whereof three of them I found were unarmed, and (as I thought)
bound; and when the first four or five of them were jumped on
shore, they took those three out of the boat as prisoners. One
of the three I could perceive using the most passionate gestures
of entreaty, affliction and despair, even to a kind of extravagance;
the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their hands sometimes,
and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree as the first.

I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what
the meaning of it should be. Friday called out to me in English,
as well as he could, 0 master! you see English man: eat prisoner:
a: well a: savage mane. Why, said I, Friday, do you think tho
are going to eat them then 3' Yes, says Friday, they will eat them.
No, no, said I, Friday; I am afraid they will murder them indeed;
but you may be sure they will not eat them.

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was,
but stood trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every
moment when the three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I
saw one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlass (as the
seamen all it) or sword, to strike one of the poor men ; and I
expected to see him fall every moment, at which all the blood in
my body seemed to run chill in my veins.

I wished heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage that
was gone with him; or that I had any way to have come un-
discovered within shot of them, that I might have rescued the
three men; for I saw no fire-arms they had among them; but it
fell out to my mind another way.

After I had observed the outrageous usage of the three men
by the insolent seamen, I observed the fellows ran seattering
about the land, as if they wanted to see the country. I ob-
served, that the three other men had liberty to go also where they
pleased; but they sat down all three upon the ground very pen-
sive, and looked like men in despair.

This put me in mind of the first time when I came on shore,
and began to look about me; how I gave myself over for lost,
how wildly I looked round me, what dreadful apprehensions I
had, and how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of being
devoured by wild beasts.

As I knew nothing that night of the supply I was to receive
by the providential driving of the ship nearer the land, by the
storms and tide by which I have since been so long nourished
and supported; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it was
to them, and how efi'ectually and really they were in a condition
of safety, at the same time that they thought themselves lost,
and their case desperate.

So little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason
have we to depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world,
that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely destitute, but
that in the worst circumstances they have always something to
be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than
they imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the
means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction.

It was just at the top of high-water when these people mm:
on shore, and while partly they stood parleying with the prisoners
they brought, and partly while they rambled about to see what
kind of place they were in, they had carelessly staid till the tide
was spent, and the water was ebbed considerably away, leaving
their boat aground.

They had left two men in the boat, who, as I found after-
wards, having drank a little too much brandy, fell asleep; how-
ever, one of them waking sooner than the other, and finding the
boat too fast aground for him to stir it, halloocd for the rest who
were straggling about, upon which they all soon came to the
boat; but it was past all their strength to launch her, the boat
being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy
sand, almost like a quicksand.

In this condition, like true seamen, who are, perhaps, the

least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it over, and
away they strolled about the country again; and I heard one of
them say aloud to another (calling them off from the boat),
Why let her alone, Jack, can't ye? she'll float next tide. By
which I was fully confirmed in the main inquiry, of what coun-
trymen they were. '
: All this while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir
out of my castle, any farther than to my place of observation,
near the top of the hill ; and very glad I was, to think how well
it was fortified. I knew it was no less than ten hours before the
boat could be on float again, and by that time it would be dark,
and I might be more at liberty to see their motions, and to hear
their discourse, if they had any.

In the mean time I fitted myself up for a battle, as before,
though with more caution, knowing I had to do with another
kind of enemy than I had at first. I ordered Friday also, whom
I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself
with arms. I took myself two fowling--pieces, and I gave him
three musquets: my figure, indeed, was very. fierce; I had my
formidable goat-skin coat on, with the great up I have men-
tioned, a naked sword by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a
gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any
attempt till it was dark; but about two o'clock, being the heat
of the day, I found that in short they were all gone straggling
into the woods, and, as I thought, were laid down to sleep; the
three poor distressed men too anxious for their condition to get

u
any sleep, were however set down under the shelter of a great
tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and as I thought, out
of sight of any of the rest.

Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them, and learn
something of their condition. Immediately I marched in the
figure as above, my man Friday at a good distance behind me,
as formidable for his arms as I, but not making quite so staring
a spectre-like figure as I did.

I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before
any of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, What
are ye, Gentlemen ?

They started up at the noise; but were ten times more con-
founded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made:
they made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just
going to fly from me, when I spoke to them in English. Gen-
tlemen, said I, do not be surprised at me; perhaps you may
have a friend near you, when you did not expect it. He must
be sent directly from Heaven, then, mid one of tlzem very gravel}
to me, and pulling ofl' his he! at the same time to me, for our con--
dition is past the help of man. All help is from Heaven, Sir,
said I: but can you put a stranger in the way how to help you ?
for you seem to me to be in some great distress. I saw you
when you landed; and when you seemed to make application to
the brutes that came with you--I saw one of them lift up his
sword to kill you.

The poor man with tears running down his face, and trembling,
looking like one astonished, returned, film I talking to God 07'
man 5? I: it a real man, or an angel .9 Be in no fear about that,
Sir, mid I : if Goo had sent an angel to relieve you, he would
have come better clothed, and armed after another manner than
you see me in; pray lay aside your fears; I am a man, an Eng-
lirlzman, and disposed to assist you; you see I have one servant
only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, Can we
serve you? What is your case?
Our use, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while our mur-
derers are so near; but in short, Sir, I was commander of that
ship; my men have mutinied against me, they have been hardly
prevailed on not to murder me, and at last have set me on shore
in this desolate place, with these two men with me, one my
mate, the other a passenger; where we expected to perish, be-
lieving the place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what to
think of it.

Where are those brutes, your enemies? said I : Do you know
where they are gone? There they lie, Sir, said he, pointing to a
thicket of trees; my heart tremble: for fear they have seen us,
and heard you speak; if they have, they will certainly murder
a: all.

Have they any fire arms? said I: he answered, they had only
two pieces, and one which they left in the boat. Well then,
said I, leave the rest to me; I seetheyareall asleep; it is an
easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take them pri-
soners? He told me there were two desperate villains among
them, that it was scarce safe to shew any mercy to; but if they
were secured, he believed all the rest would return to their duty.
I asked him, Which they were? He told me, he could not at
that distance describe them; but he would obey my orders in
any thing I would direct. Well, said I, let us retreat out of
their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we will resolve fur-
ther; so they willingly went back with me, till the woods
covered us from them.

Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your deliverance,
are you willing to make two conditions with me? He anticipated
my proposals, by telling me, that both he and the ship, if rc-
covered, should be wholly directed and commanded by me in
every thing; and if the ship was not recovered, he would live
and die with me in what part oftheworld soever I would send
him; and the two other men said the me.

Well, said I, my condition: are but two: I. That while you
stay on this island with me, you will not pretend to any autho--
rity here; and if I put arms into your hands, you will upon all
occasions give them up to me, and do no prejudice to me or.
mine, upon this island, and in the mean time to be governed by
my orders. '

2. That if the ship is, or may be recovered, you will carry me
and my man to England, passage free.

He gave me all the assurance that the invention and faith of
man could devise, that he would comply with these most reason-
able demands; and besides, would owe his life to me, and ac-
knowledge it upon all occasions as long as he lived.

Well then, mid I, here are three muskets for you, with pow-
der and ball ; tell me next what you think is proper to be done:
he shewed all the testimony of his gratitude that he was able;
but offered to be wholly guided by me: I told him, I thought
it was hard venturing any thing; but the best method I could
think of, was to fire upon them at once, as they lay; and if any
were not killed at the first volley, and offered to submit, we
might save them, and so put it wholly upon Gon's providence
to direct the shot.

He said, very modestly, that he was loth to kill them, if he
could help it; but that those two were incorrigible villains, and
had been the authors of all the mutiny in the ship, and if they
escaped, we should be undone still: for they would go on board,
and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy us all. Well
then, said I, netexsity legitimates my advice; for it is the only
way to save our lives. However, seeing him still cautious of
shedding blood, I told him, they should go themselves, and
manage as they found convenient.

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake,
and soon after we saw two of them on their feet. I asked him,
If either of them were the men who he had said were the heads
of the mutiny? He said No. Well then, said I, you may let
them eseape, and Providence seems to have wakeried them on
purpose to save themselves: Now, said I, if the rest escape you,
it 3': your fault.

Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in
'his hand, and pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him,
with each man a piece in his hand: .the two men, who were with
him, going first, made some noise, at which one of the seamen,
who was awake, turned about, and seeing them coming, cried
out to the rest; but it was too late then; for the moment he
cried out, they fired, 1 mean the two men, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece: they had 'so well aimed their shot at
.the men they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and
the other very much wounded; but not being dead, he started
up upon his feet, and called eagerly for help to the other: but
'the captain, stepping to him, told him it was too late to cry for
help; he should call upon GOD to forgive his villany; and with
that word knocked him down with the stock of his musket, so
that he never spoke more: there were three more in the com-
pany, and one of them was also slightly wounded; by this time
I was come; and when they saw their danger, and that it was
:in vain to resist, they begged for mercy. The captain told them
he would spare their lives, if they would give him any assurance
pf their abhorrence of the treachery they had been guilty of, and
would swear to be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and
afterwards in carrying her back to 74min, from whence they
came. They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity
that could be desired; and he was willing to believe them, and
spare their lives, which I was not against; only I obliged him
to keep them bound hand and foot while they were upon the
island.

' While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain's mate to
the boat, with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and
sail, which they did; and by and bye, three smggling men, that
were (happily for them) parted from the rest, came back upon
hearing the guns fired; and seeing their captain, who before was
their prisoner, now their conqueror, they submitted to be bound
also, and so our victory was complete.

It now remained, that the captain and I should inquire into
one another's circumstances. I began first, and told him my
whole history, which he heard with an attention even to amaze-
ment, and particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
furnished with provisions and ammunition; and indeed, as my
story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply;
but when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I?
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life,
the tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word
more.

After this communication was at an end, I carried him and
his two men into my apartment, leading them in just where I
came out, viz. at the top of the house; where I refreshed them
with such provisions as I had, and shewed them all the con-
trivnnces I had made during my long, long inhabiting that
place.

All I shewed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing;
but above all, the captain admired my fortification; and how
perfectly I had concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which,
having now been planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-
ing much faster than in England, was become a little wood, and
so thick, that it was unpassable in any part of it, but at that one
side where I had reserved my little winding passage into it: I
told him this was my castle, and my residence; but that I had
a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could
retreat upon occasion, and I would shew him that too another
time; but at present our business was to consider how to recover
the ship. He agreed with me as to that; but told me, he was
perfectly at a less what measures to take; for that there were

a."
still six-and--twenty hands on board, who having entered into a
cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their lives to
the law, would be hardened in it now by desperation ; and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were reduced, they should be
brought to the gallows as soon as they came to England, or to
any of the English colonies; and that therefore there would be
no attacking them with so small a number as we were.

I mused for some time upon what he had said, and found it
was a very rational conclusion, and that therefore something was
to be resolved on very speedily, as well to draw the men on
board into some snare for their surprise, as to prevent their
landing upon us, and destroying us: upon this it presently
occurred to me, that in a little while, the ship's crew, wondering
what was become of their comrades, and of the boat, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat to see for them; and
that then perhaps they might come armed, and be too strong for
us: this he allowed was rational.

Upon this I told him, the first thing we were to do, was to
stave the boat, which lay upon the beech, so that they might not
carry her all"; and taking every thing out of her, leave her so
far useless as not to be fit to swim; accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out of her, and
whatever else we found there, which was a bottle of brandy, and
another of rum, a few biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a
great lump of sugar in a piece of canvass; the sugar.was five
or six pounds; all which was very welcome to me, especially
the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for many
years.

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars,
mast, sail, and rudder of the boat, were carried away before, as
above), we knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they had
come strong enough to master us, yet they could not cerrry off
.the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we could be
able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they went
away without the boat, I did not much question to make her fit
again to carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our
friends the Spaniard: in my way; for I had them still in my
thoughts. .

Whilewe were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by
'main strength, heaved the boat up upon the beach, so high that
the tide would not float her off at high-water mark; and,
besides, had broken a hole in her bottom, too big to be quickly
stopped, and were sat down musing what we should do, we heard
the ship fire a gun, and.saw her make a waft with her ancient,
as a signal for the boat to come on board, but no boat stirred ; and
they fired several times, making other signals for the boat.

At last, when all their signals and firings proved fruitless, and
'they found the boat did not stir, we saw them (by the help of
my glasses) hoist another boat out, and row towards the shore;
and we found, as they approached, that there were no less than
ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms with them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a
full view of them as they came, and a plain sight of the men,
even of their faces; because the tide having set them a little to
the east of the other boat, they rowed up under shore, to come
to the same place where the other had landed, and where the
boat lay.

By this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and the
captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the
boat; of whom he said that there were three very honest fellows,
who, he was sure, were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being
overpowered and frighted.

But that as for the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief
oflieer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as
any of the ship's crew; and were, no doubt, made desperate in
their new enterprize; and terribly apprehensive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.

I smiled at him, and told him, that men in our circumstances
were past the operation of fear: that seeing almost every con-
dition that could be was better than that we were supposed to be
in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or
life, would be sure to be a deliverance. I asked him, what he
thought of the circumstances of my life, and whether a deliver--
ance was not worth venturing for? And where, Sir, said I, is
your belief of my being preserved here on purpose to save your
life, which elevated you a little while ago? For my part, said
I, there seems to be but one thing amiss in all the prospect of it.
What i: that? says he. Why, said I, it is that, as you say,
- there are three or four honest fellows among them, which should
be spared; had they been all of the wicked part of the crew, I
should have thought Goo's providence had singled them out to
deliver them into your hands; for, depend upon it, every man
of them that comes ashore are our own, and shall die or live, as
they behave to us.

As I spoke this with a raised voice and cheerful countenance,
I found it greatly encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our
business: we had, upon the first appearance of the boat's coming
from the ship, considered of separating our prisoners, and had
indeed secured them effectually.

Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three (delivered
men) to my cave, where they were remote enough, and out of
danger of being heard or discovered, or of finding their way out
of the woods, if they could have delivered themselves: here
they left them bound, but gave them provisions, and promised
them, if they continued there quietly, to give them their liberty
in a day or two ;- but that if they attempted their weape, they
should be put to death without mercy. They promised faith--

M a274 Ln-'s AND onsx-rvitss

fully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very
thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions,
and a light left them; for Friday gave them candles (such as
we made ourselves) for their comfort; and they did not know
but that he stood sentinel over them at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept
pinioned indeed, because the captain was not free to trust them;
but the other two were taken into my service upon their captain's
recommendation, and upon their solemnly engaging to live and
die with us; so, with them and the three honest men, we were
seven men well armed; and I made no doubt we should be able
to deal well enough with the ten that were coming, considering
that the captain had said, there were three or four honest men
among them also.

As soon as they got to the place where their other boat lay,
they ran their boat into the beach, and came all on shore, hauling
the boat up after them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the boat at an anchor, some distance
from the shore, with some hands in her to guard her; and so
we should not be able to seize the boat.

Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran all to the
other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great sur-
prise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a
great hole in her bottom.

After they had mused awhile upon this, they set up two or
three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try if they
could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose;
then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their
small arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made .the
woods ring; but it was all one; those in the cave, we were sure,
could not hear; and those in our keeping, though they heard it
well enough, yet durst give no answer .to them.

They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that, as they
told us afterwards, they resolved to go 'all on board again to
their ship, and let them know there, that the men were all mur-
dered, and the long-boat saved; accordingly, they immediately
launched the boat again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded at
this, believing they would go on board the ship again, and set
sail, giving their comrades up for lost, and so he should still lose
the ship, which he was in hopes we should have recovered; but
he was quickly as much frighted the other way. -

They had not been long put of? with the boat, but we per-
ceived them all coming on shore again; but with this new
measure in their conduct, which, it seems, they consulted together
upon, viz. to leave three men in the boat, and the rest to go on
shore, and go up into the country to look for their fellows.

This was a great disappointment to us; for now we were at a
loss what to do; for our seizing those seven men on shore would
be no advantage .to us if we let the boat escape; because they
would then row away to the ship; and then the rest of them

would be sure to weigh, and set sail, and so our recovering the
ship would be lost.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and see what the

issue of things might present: the seven men came on shore,
and the three who remained in the boat put her off to a good
distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for
them; so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the
boat.
Thou that came on shore kept close together, marching
towards the top of the little hill, under which my habitation
lay; and we could see them plainly, though they could not per-
ceive us: we could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, so'that' we might have fired at them; or that they
would have gone farther oil", that we might have come abroad. '

But when they were come to the brow of the hill, where they.

U
could see a great way in the valley and woods, which lay towards
the north-cart part, and where the island lay lowest, they shouted
and hallooed till they were weary ; and not caring, it seems, to
venture far from the shore, nor far from one another, they sat
down together under a tree, to consider of it: had they thought
fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other party of them had
done, they had done thejob for us; but they were too full of
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they
could not tell what the danger was they had to fear neither.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this con-
sultation of theirs; e-iz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley
again, to endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we
should all sally upon them,just at the juncture when their pieces
Were all discharged, and they would certainly yield, and we
should have them without bloodshed. I liked the proposal,
provided it was done while we were near enough to come up to
them, before they could load their pieces again.

But this event did not happen, and we lay still a long time,
very irresolute what course to take; at length I told them, there
would be nothing to be done in my opinion till night; and
then, if they did not return to the boat, perhaps we might find
a way to get between them and the shore, and so might use some
stratagem with them in the boat, to get them on shore.

We waited a great while, though very impatient for their
removing, and were very uneasy: when, after long consultations,
we saw them start all up, and march down toward the sea: it
Seems, they had such dreadful apprehensions upon them of the
danger of the place, that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their
intended voyage with the ship.

' As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined
it to be as it really was; that they had given over their search,
and were for going back again ;' and the captain, as soon as I told
him my thoughts, was ready to sink at the apprehensions of it;
but 1 presently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back again,
and which answered my end to a tittle.

I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go over the little
creek westward, towards the place where the ravage: came on
shore when Friday was rescued; and as soon as they came to a
little rising ground, at about half a mile distance,l bade them halloo
as loud as they could, and wait till they found the seamen heard
them; that as soon as ever they heard the seamen answer them,
they should return it again, and then, keeping out of sight, take
a round, always answering when the others hallooed, to draw
them as far into the island, and among the woods, as possible,
and then wheel about again to me, by such ways as I directed
them.

They were just going into the boat, when Friday, and the
mate hallooed, and they presently heard them, and answering
run along the shore westward towards the voice they heard,
when they were presently stopped by the creek, where, the water
being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to
come up, and set them over, as indeed I expected.

When they had set themselves over, I observed that the boat
being gone up a good way into the creek, and as it were in an
harbour within the land, they took one of the three men out of
her to go along with them, and left only two in the boat, having
fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.

This was what I wished for, and immediately leaving Friday
and the captain's mate to their business, I took the restwith me,
and crossing the creek out of their sight, we surpriwd the two
men before they were aware, one of them lying on shore, and
the other being in the boat; the fellow on shore was between
sleeping and waking, and going to start up, the captain, who
was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down, and
then called out tohimintheboattoyield, orhewasadead man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a single ma'n'
to yield, when he saw five men upon him, and his comrade
knocked down; besides this was, it seems, one of the three that
were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew, and
therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but afterwards
to join very sincere with us.

In the mean time, I'rida] and the captain's mate so well
managed their business with the rest, that they drew them, by
hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from one
wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left
them where they were very sure they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily tired
themselves also by the time they came back to us.

\Ve had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the
dark, and to fall upon them, so as to make sure work with
them. '

It was several hours after Friday came back to me before
they came back to their boat; and we could hear the foremost
of them, long before they came quite up, calling to those behind
to come along , and could also hear them answer, and complain
how lame and tired they were, and not being able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us.

At length they came up to the boat; but it is impossible to
express their confusion, when they found the boat fast a-ground
in the creek. The tide ebbed out, and their two men gone;
we could hear them call to one another in a most lamentable
manner, telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted
island; that either there were inhabitants in it, and they should
all be murdered; or else there were devils or spirits in it, and
they should be all carried away and devoured.

They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by'their
names a great many times, but no ansWer: after some time, we
could see them, by the little light there was, run about wringing
their hands, like men in despair; and that sometimes they would
go and sit down in the boat to rest themselves, then come ashore
again, and walk about, and so over the same thing again.

My men would fain have had me given them leave to fall
upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them
at some advantage, so to spare them, and kill as few of them as
I could; and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any
of our own men, knowing the other were very .well armed: I
resolved to wait to see if they did not separate; and therefore, to
make sure of them, I drew my ambuscade nearer; and ordered
Friday and the captain to creep upon their hands and feet as close
to the ground as they could, that they might not be discovered,
and get as near them as they could possibly, before they offered
to fire.

They had not been long in that posture but that the boatswain,
who was the principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now
shewn himself the most dejected and dispirited of all the rest,
came walking towards them with two more of the crew; the
captain was so eager, as having this principal rogue so much in
his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him come
so near as to be sure of him; for they only heard his tongue
before: but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday,
starting upon their feet, let fly at them.

The boatswain was killed upon the spot; the next man was
shot into the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die
till an hour or two after; and the third run for it.

At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced with my
whole army, which was now eight men; viz. myself, general-
iuim ; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain and his two
men, and the three prisoners of war, who we had trusted with
arms. ,

We came upon them indeed in the dark, so that they could
notseeournumber;andl madethe man they hadleftin
the boat, who was now one of us, to call them by name, to
try if I could bring them to a parley, and so might perhaps
reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we desired; for
indeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was, they
would be very willing to capitulate; so he calls out, as loud as
he could, to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith. 'I' om Smith
answered immediately, Who': that! Robinson! For it seems he
knew his voice. The other answered, Ay, ay; for God's :ahe,
Tom Smith, throw down your arm, and yield, or you are all dead
men thi: moment.

Who must we yield to? Where are they ? says Smith again.
Here they are, says he: here is our captain and fifty men with
him, have been hunting you this two hours; the boatswain is
killed; Will Frye is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if you
do not yield, you are all lost.

Will they give us quarter then? says Tom Smith, and we will
yield. I'll go and ask, ifyou promise to yield, says Rohim'on. So
he asked the captain, and the captain himself then calls out;
You, Smith, you know my voice, if you lay down your arms
immediately, and submit, you shall have your lives, all but lei/ill
dtkim.

Upon this Will zit/tin: cried out, For God': sake, captain, give
me quarter: what have I done .9 they have been all a: had a: I .-
(which by the way was not true, neither; for it seems this W'ill
Atkins was the first man that laid hold of the captain when they
first mutinied, and used him barbarously, in tying his hands, and
giving him injurious language :) however the captain told him
he must lay down his arms at discretion, and trust to the go-
vernor's mercy, by which he meant me; for they all called me
governor.

In a word, they all laid down their arms, and begged their
lives; and I sent the man that had parlied with them, and two
more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty
men, which, particularly with those three, were all but eight,
came up and seized upon them all, and upon their boat, only
that I kept myself and one more out of sight, for reasons of
state. '

Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think of seizing
the ship; and as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley
with them, he expostulated with them upon the villany of their
practices with him, and at length, upon the farther wickedness of
their design; and how certainly it must bring them to misery
and dish-ess in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.

They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their
lives. As for that he told them they were none of his prisoners,
but the commander of the island; that they thought they had
set him on shore in a barren uninhabited island ; but it had
pleased GOD so to direct them, that the island was inhabited, and
that the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang them
all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there
asjustice required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by
the governor to advise to prepare for death; for that he would
be hanged m the morning.

Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired
effect: Alkin: fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede
with the governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him
for Goo' s sake, that they might not be sent to England.

It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliverance was
come, and that it would be a most easy thing to bring these fel-
lows in to be hearty m getting possession of theship , so I retired
in the dark from them, that they might not see what kind of a
governor they had, and called the captain to me; when I called,
as at a good distance, one of the men was ordered to speak again,
and say to the eapsain, Captain the commander call: fir you : and
presently. the captain replied, Tell lu': exrrllenq I ant/'1"! a coming.
This more perfectly amused them; and they all believed, that
the commander was just by with his fifty men.

Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my project for
seizing the ship, which he liked of wonderfully well, and resolved
to put it in execution the next morning.

But, in order to execute it with more art, and secure of suc-
cess, I told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should
go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and
send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was
committed to Friday, and the two men who came on shore with
the captain. .

They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison; and it was
indeed a dismal place, especially to men in their condition.

The other I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I
have given a full description; and as it was fenced in, and they
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were
upon their behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter
into a parley with them: in a word, to try them, and tell me,
whether he thought they might be trusted or no, to go on board,
and surprise the ship: he talked to them of the injury done him,
of the condition they were brought to: and that though the go-
vernor had given them quarter for their lives as to the present
action, yet that if they were sent to England, they would all be
hanged in chains, to be sure; but that if they would join in so
just an attempt, as to recover the ship, he would have the go--
vernor's engagement for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be
accepted by men in their condition; they fell down on their knees
to the captain, and promised with the deepest impreeations, that
they would be faithful to him to the last drop, and that they
should owe their lives to him, and would go with him all over
the world; that they would own him for a father to them as
long as they lived.
Well, says the captain, I must go and tell the governor what
yousay, and see whatI an do to bring himtoconsenttoit:
so he brought me an account of the temper he found them in,
and that he verily believed they would be faithful.

However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should
go back again, and chooa 'out those five, and tell them, they
might see that he did not want men; that he would take out
those five to be his assistants, and that the governor would keep
the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the castle,
(my save) as hostages, for the fidelity of those five; and that if
they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should
be hanged in chains alive upon the shore.

This looked severe, and convinced them that the governor
was in earnest; however, they had no way left them but to
accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much
as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition. r.
The captain, his mate, and passenger. 2. Then the two pri-
soners of the first gang, to whom, having their characters from
the eaptain, I had given their liberty, and trusted them with arms.
3. The other two who I had kept till now in my bower pinioned;
but, upon the captain's motion, had now released. 4. These
five released at last; so that they were twelve in all, besides five
we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these
bands on board the ship: for as for me and my man Friday, I
did not think it was proper for us to stir, having seven men left
behind; and it was employment enough for us to keep them
asunder, and supply them with victuals.

As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast; but
Friday went twice a day to them, to supply them with necessa-
ries; and I made the other two carry provisions to a certain dis--
tance, where Friday was to take it.
When I shewed myself to the two hostages, it was with the
captain, who told them, I was the person the governor had
ordered to look after them, and that it was the governor's pla-
sure that they should not stir any where but by my direction;
that if they did, they should be fetched into the castle, and be
laid in irons; so that as we never sufi'ered them to see me as
governor, so I now appared as another person, and spoke of
the governor, the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all
occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish
his two boats, stop the breach of one, and man them ; he made
his passenger captain of one, with four other men ; and himself,
and his mate, and five more, went in the other; and they con-
trived their business very well; for they came up to the ship
about midnight. As soon as they came within call of the ship,
he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had brought off
the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they
had found them, and the like; holding them in a chat, till they
came to the ship's side; when the captain and the mate, entering
first with their arms, immediately knocked down the second mate
and carpenter with the butt end of their musquets, being very
faithfully seconded by their men; they secured all the rest that
were upon the main and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the
hatches to keep them down who were below, when the other
boat, and their men, entering at the fore-chains, secured the
farecastle of the ship, and the skuttle which went down into
the cook-room, making the three men they found there pri-
soners. .
When this was done, and all safe upon deck, the captain
ordered the mate with three men to break into the round house,
where the new rebel captain lay, and, having taken the alarm,
was gotten up, and with two men and a boy had gotten fire--arms
in their hands; and when the mate with a crow split open the
door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and
wounded the mate with a musquet ball, which broke his arm,
and wounded two more of the men, but killed nobody.

The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into the round~
house, wounded as he was, and with his pistol shot the new cap-
tain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and
came out again behind one of his ears; so that he never spoke a
word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken
effectually, without any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered
seven guns to be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with
me, to give me notice of his success; which you may be sure I
was very glad to hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it
till near two of the clock in the morning.

Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it
having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till
I was something surprised with the noise of a gun ; and presently
starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of Governor,
governor: and presently I knew the captain's voice, when climb--
ing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and pointing to the
ship, he embraced me in his arms. My dear friend and deliverer,
says he, there is your ship, for :he i: all you", and :o are we,
and all that helong to her. I cast my eyes to the ship, and there
she rode within a little more than half a mile of the shore; for
they had weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of
her; and the weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor
just against the mouth of the little creek; and the tide being up,
the captain had brought the pinnace in near the place where I
first landed my rafts, and so landed just at my door.

I was, at first, ready to sink down with the surprise: for I saw
my deliverance indeed visibly put into my hands, all things easy,
andalnrgeshipjustreadytoearrymewhitherl pleased togo.
At first, for some time, I was not able to answer him oneword;
but as he had taken me in his arms, I held fast by him, or I
should have fallen to the ground.

He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulls a bottle out
of his pocket, and gave me a dram of cordial, which he brought
on purpose for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the
ground, and though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good
while before I could speak a word to him.

All this while the poor man was in as great an ecstasy as I,
only not under any surprise, as I was; and he said a thousand
kind tender things to me, to compose me and bring me to my-
self; but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all
my spirits into confusion; at last it broke out into tears, and in
a little'while afterl recovered my speech.

Then I took my turn and embraced him as my deliverer, and
we rejoiced together. I told him, I looked upon him as a man
sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction
seemed to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these were
the testimonies we had of a secret hand of Providence governing
the World, and an evidence, that the eyes of an infinite power
could search into the remotest comer of the world, and send help
to the miserable whenever he pleased.

I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulnesa to Heaven;
and what heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in
a miraculous manner provided for one in such a wilderness, and
in such a desolate condition, but from whom every deliverance
must always be acknowledged to proceed!

When we had talked awhile, the captain told me, he had
brought me some little refreshments, such as the ship afi'orded,
and such as the wretches, that had been so long his masters, had
not plundered him of: upon this he called aloud to the boat,
and bid his men bring the things ashore that were for the go-
vernor; and indeed it was a present as if I had been one, not
that was to be carried along with them, but as if I had been to
dwell upon the island still. and they were all to go without me.
First, he had brought meaaseofbottles full ofexeellenteor-
dial waters, six large bottles of We wine; the bottles held
two quarts a piece; two pound of excellent good tobacco, twelve
good pieces of the ship's beef, and six pieces of pork, with a bag
of peas, and about a hundred weight of biscuit.

He brought me also a box of sugar, 9. box of flour, a bag full
of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other
things: but besides these, and what was a thousand times more
useful to me, he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes, a hat, and one
pair of stockings, and a very good suit of clothes of his own,
which had been worn but very little: in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot.

It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one may
imagine to one in my circumstances; but never was any thing in
the world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy, as it
was to me to wear such clothes at their first putting on.

After these ceremonies passed, and after all his good things
were brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what
was to be done with the prisoners we had; for it was worth con-
sidering whether we might venture to take them away with us
or no, especially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigible
and refractory to the last degree; and the eaptain said he knew
they were such rogues, that there was no obliging them; and if
he did carry them away it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be

- delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come
at; and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about
It.

Upon this, I told him, that if he desired it, I durst undertake
to bring the two men he spoke of, to make it their own request
that he should leave them upon the island. I should he very glad
of that, says the captain, with all as) heart.

Well, said I, I will send for them up, and talk with them for
you: so I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they Were
now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise;
I say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five
men, pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there
till I came.

After some time, I came thither dressed in my new habit, and
now I was called governor again. Being all met, and the up-
tain with me, I caused the men to be brought before me, and I
told them, I had had a full account of their villanous behaviour
to the captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and
were preparing to commit farther robberies; but that Providence
had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had digged for others.

I let them know, that by my direction the ship had been
seized, that she lay now in the road, and they might see by and
by, that their new captain had received the reward of his villany;
for that they might see him hanging at the yard arm.

That as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say,
why I should not execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by
my commission they could not doubt I had authority to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say but this, That when they were taken, the captain
promised them their lives, and they humbly implored my mercy :
but I told them I knew not what mercy to shew them; for, as
for myself, I had resolved to quit the island with all my men,'
and had taken passage with the captain to go for England: and
as for the captain, he could not carry them to England, other
than as prisoners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and running
away with the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs
know, would be the gallows: so that I could not tell which was
best for them, unless they had a' mind to take their fate in the
island: if they desired that, I did not care, asI had liberty to
leave it; I had some inclination to give them their lives, if they
thought they could shift on shore. They seemed very thankful
for it; said they would much rather venture to stay there, "than
to be earried to England to be hanged: so I left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it,
as if he durst not leave them there: upon this I seemed to be a
little angry with the captain, and told him, that they were my
prisoners, not his ; and that seeing I had offered them so much
favour, I would be as good as my word; and that if he did not
think fit to consent to it, I would set them at liberty as I found
them; and if he did not like that, he might take them again, if
he could catch them.

Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I accordingly set
them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods, to the place
whence they came, and I Would leave them some lire--arms, some
ammunition, and some directions how they should live very well,
if they thought fit.

Upon this, I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the
captain, that I would stay that night to prepare my things; and
desired him to go on board invthe meantime, and keep all right
in the ship, and send the boat on shore the next day for me;
ordering him, in the meantime, to cause the new captain, who
was killed, to be hanged at the yard arm, that these men might
see him.

When the captain was gone, I sent for the men up. to me to
my apartment, and entered seriously into discourse with them of
their circumstances. I told them, I thought they had made a
right choice; that if the captain carried them away, they. would
certainly be hanged. I showed them the new captain hanging
at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had nothing less
to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then
told them Iwould let them into the story of my living there,
and put them into the way of making it easy to them: accord-
ingly I gave them the whole history of the place, and of my

N
coming to it; shewed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and, in a word,
all that was necessary to make them easy. I told them the story
also of the sixteen Spaniard: that were to be expected; for whom
I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common
with themselves.

I left them my fire-arms; viz. five musquets, three fowling--
pieces, and three swords. I had above a barrel and a half of
powder left; for after the first year or two I used but little, and
wasted none. I gave them a description of the way I managed
the goats, and directions to milk and fatten them, to make both
butter and cheese.

In a word, I gave them every part of my own story ; and I
told them, I would prevail with the captain to leave them two
barrels of gunpowder more, and some garden-seeds, which I told
them I would have been very glad of; also I gave them the bag
of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade them
be sure to sow and increase them.

Having done all this, I left them the next day, and went on
board the ship; we prepared immediately to sail, but did not
weigh that night. The next morning early, two of the five men
came swimming to the ship's side, and making a most lamentable
complaint of the other three, begged to be taken into the ship,
for Gop's sake, for they should be murdered; and begged the
captain to take them on board, though he hanged them imme-
diately.

Upon this the captain pretended to have no power without
me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were some time after
soundly whipped and pickled; after which they proved very
honest and quiet fellows.

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide
being up, with the things promised to the men, to which the
captain, at my intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be
added, which they took, and were very thankful for. I also en~
couraged them, by telling them, that if it lay in my way to send
a vessel to take them in, I would not forget them.

Whenl took leave of this island, I carried on board for reliques
the great goat's-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and my par-
rot; also I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned,
which had lain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty, or
tarnished, and could hardly pass for silver, till it had been a little
rubbed and handled; as also the money I found in the wreck of
the Spanish ship.

And thus I left the island the nineteenth of December, as I
found by the ship's account, in the year 1636, after I had been
upon it eight and twenty years, two months, and nineteen days;
being delivered from this second captivity the same day of the
month that I first made my escape in the Burco--longo, from
among the Mean of Sallee.

In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in England, the
eleventh of fun, in the year 1687, having been thirty and five
years absent.

. When I came to England, I was as perfect a stranger to all the
world, as if I had never been known there: my benefactor, and
faithful steward, who I had left in trust with my money, was
alive, but had had great misfortunes in the world, was become a
widow the second time, and very low in the world. I made her
easy as to what she owed me, assuring her, I would give her no
trouble; but on the contrary, in gratitude to her former are and
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would afford,
which at that time would indeed allow me to do but little for
her : but I assured her, I would never forget her former kindness
to me; nor did I forget her, when I had sufficient to help her;
asshallbeobservedinitsplace.

- I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my father was
(lead, and my mother, and all the family extinct; except that I
found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers:
and as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been
no provision made for me, so that, in a word, I found nothing
to relieve or assist me; and that little money I had, would not
do much for me as to settling in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which I did not
expect ; and this was, that the master of the ship, who I had so
happily delivered, and by the same means saved the ship and
cargo, having given a very handsome account to the owners of
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men, and the ship,
they invited me to meet them, and some other merchants con-
cerned, and all together made me a very handsome compliment
upon the subject, and a present of almost two hundred pounds
sterling.

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of
my life, and how little way this would go towards settling me in
the world, I resolved to go to Lidia", and see if I might not
come by some information of the state of my plantation in the
Brad/5, and of what was become of my partner, who, I had
reason to suppose, had some years now given me over for dead.

W ith this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I arrived in
flpril following; my man Friday accompanying me very honestly
in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon
all occasions.

When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my
particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship,
who first took me up at sea, off of the shore of Africa: he was
now grown old, and had left off the sea, having put his son, who
was far from a young man, into his ship; and who still used the
Brasil trade. The old man did not know me, and indeed, I
hardly knew him ; but I soon brought him to my remembrance,
and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, whenI told him
who I was.
- After some passionate expressions of the old acduaintance, I
inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation, and my partner.
The old man told me, he had not been in the Brasil: for about
nine years; but that he could assure me, that when he came
away my partner was living; but the trustees, whom I had joined
with him, to take cognizance of my part, were both dead; that,
however, he believed that I would have a very good account of
the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the general
belief of my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given
in the account of the produce of my part of the plantation to the
procurator fiscal ; who had appropriated it, in case I never came
to claim it, one third to the King, and two--thirds to the monas-
tery of St. Augustine, to be expended for the benefit of the poor,
and for the conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but
that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the inheritance,
it should be restored; only that the improvement, or annual pro-
duction, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored;
but he assured me that the steward of the king's revenue (from
lands) and the provedore, or steward of the monastery, had taken
great care, all along, that the incumbent, that is to say, my
partner, gave every year a faithful account of the produce, of
which they received duly my moiety.

I asked him, if he knew to what height of improvement he
had brought the plantation: and whether he thought it might
be worth looking after; or whether, on my going thither, I
should meet with no obstruction to my possessing my just right
in the moiety.

He told me, he could not tell exactly to what degree the plan--
tation was improved: but this he knew, that my partner was
grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying but one half of it! and
that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard that the king's
third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away to some
other monastery, or religious house, amounted to above two
hundred moidores' a year; that, as to my being restored to a
quiet possession of it, there was no question to be made of that,
my partner being alive to witness my title, and my name being
also inrolled in the register of the country. Also he told me,
that the survivors of my two trustees were very fair, honest
people, and very wealthy, and he believed I would not only have
their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a
very considerable sum of money in their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm, while their fathers held the trust,
and before it was given up as above, which, as he remembered,
was for about twelve years.

I shewed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account,
and inquired of the old captain, how it came to pass, that the
trustees should thus dispose my effects, when he knew that I
had made my will, and had made him, the Portuguese captain,
my universal heir, 55:.

He told me, that was true; but that, as there was no proof
of my being dead, he could not act as executor, until some cer-
tain account should come of my death; and that, besides, he
was not willing to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it
was true, he had registered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he
would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the
ilzgenio (So they call the sugar-house) and had given his son, who
was now at the Brasils, order to do it.

But, (says the old man) I have one piece of news to tell you,
which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the rest; and
that is, that believing you were lost, and all the world believing
so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account to me in
your name, for six or eight of the first years of profits, which I
received; but there being at that time, says he, great disburse-
ments, for increasing the works, building an ingenio, and buying
slaves, it did not amount to near so much as afterwards it pro-
dueed: however, says the old man, I shall give you a true
account of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed
of it. .

After a few days further conference with this ancient friend,

he brought me an account of the six first years' income of my,
plantation, signed by my partner, and the merchant's trustees,
being always delivered in goods; 'w'z. tobacco in roll, and sugar
in chests, besides rum, molasses, (it. which is the consequence
of a sugar-work; and I found by this account, that every year
the income considerably increased: but, as above, the disburse-
ment being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old
man let me see, that he was debtor to me 470' moidorss of gold,
besides 6o chests of sugar, and I 5 double rolls of tobacco, which
were lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming home
to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the place.
. The good man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and
how he had been obliged to make use of my money to recover
his losses, and buy him a share in a new ship ;--However, my-
old friend, says he, you shall not want a. supply in your ne-
ceesity; and as soon as my son returns, you shall be fully
satisfied.

Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me 160 Par-
tugal moidores in gold; and giving me the writing of his title
to the ship which his son was gone to the Brasil: in, of which
he was a quarter part owner, and his son another, he put them
both in my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the
poor man to be able to bearthis; and remembering what he had
done for me, how he had taken me up at sea, and how gene-
rously he had used me on all occasions, and particularly how
sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain weep-
ing at what he said to me. Therefore, first I asked him if his
circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that
time, and if it would not straiten him? He told me he could
not say but it might straiten him a little: but, however, it was
my money, and I might want it more than he.

Every thing the good man said was full of affection, and I
could hardly refrain from tears while he spoke. In short, I took
one hundred of the moidores, and called for a pen and ink to
give him a receipt for them; then I returned him the rest, and
told him, if ever I had possession of the plantation, I would
return the other to him also, as indeed I afterwards did: and
that, as to the bill of sale of his part in his son's ship, I would
not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the money, I
found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but
came to receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never
have a penny more from him.

When this was passed, the old man began to ask me if he
should put me in a method to make my claim to my plantation.
I told him, I thought to go over to it myself. He said, I might
do so if I pleased; but that if I did not, there were ways enough
to secure my right, and immediately to appropriate the profits
to my use; and as there were ships in the river of Lisbon, just
ready to go away to Bran'l, he made me enter my name in a
public register, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that I was
alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for
the planting the said plantation at first.

This being regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration
affixed, he directed me to send it with a letter of his writing, to a
merchant of his acquaintance at the place; and then proposed my
staying with him till an account came of the return.

Never any thing was more honourable than the proceedings
upon this procuration ; for in less than seven months I received
a large packet from the survivors of my trustees, the merchants
for whose account I went to sea, in which were the following
particular letters and papers enclosed.
Fir", There was the account current of the produce of my
farm, or plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced
with my old Portugal captain, being for six years; the balance
appeared to be r 174. moidorss in my favour.

Second] , There was the account of four years more while they
kept the effects in their hands, before the government claimed
the administration, as being the effects of a person not to be
found, which they eell Civil Death,- and the balance of this, the
value of the plantation increasing, amounted to - cruisadoes,
which made 324.1 moidores.

Third] , There was the prior of the Augustine: account, who
had received the profits for above fourteen years; but not being
to account for what was disposed to the hospital, very honestly
declared he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he acknow-
ledged to my account. As to the king's part, that refunded
nothing.

There was a letter of my partner's, congratulating me very
affectionately upon my being alive; giving me an account how
the estate was improved, and what it produced a year, with a
particular of the number of squares, or acres, that it contained;
how planted, how many slaves there were upon it; and, making
two and twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so
many .412: Maria: to thank the blessed Virgin that I was alive,
inviting me very passionately to come over and take possesm'on
of my own, and in the mean time to give him orders to whom
he should deliver my effects, if I did not come myself; con-
cluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his
family; and sent me, as a present, seven fine leopards' skins,
which he had, it seems, received from Africa by some other ship
which he had sent thither, and who, it seems, had made a better
voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of atcellent sweet-
meats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large
as moidores.

N 2
By the same fleet my two merchant-trustees shipped me 1200
chests of sugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and the rest of the whole
account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of 705 was
better than the beginning. It is impossible to express here the
flutterings of my very heart, when I looked over these letters,
and especially when I found all my wealth about me; for as the
Braril ships come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my
letters brought my goods; and the effects were safe in the river
before the letter came to my hand. In a word, I turned pale,
and grew sick; and had not the old man run and fetched me a
Cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had overset nature,
and I had died upon the spot.

Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was so some hours,
till a physician being sent for, and something of the real cause of
my illness being known, he ordered me to be let blood, after
which I had relief, and grew Well ; but I verily believe, if it had
not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the spirits, I
should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above PS5000 sterling in
money, and had an estate, as I might well all it, in the BrasiIJ,
of above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands
in England; and in a word, I was in a condition which I searce
knew how to understand, or how to compose myself for the
enjoyment of it.

The first thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor,
my good old captain, who had been first charitable to me in my
distress, kind to me in my beginning, and honest to me at the
end. I shewed him all that was sent me; I told him that, next
to the providence of Heaven, which disposes all things, it was
owing to him; and that it now lay on me to reward him, which
I would do a hundred fold. So I first returned to him the
hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent for a nae
tary, and caused him to draw up a general release or discharge
for the 4.70 moidores which he had acknowledged he owed me,
in the fullest and firmest manner pomible; after which I eaused
a procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be my receiver
of the annual profits of my plantation, and appointed my partner
to account to him, and make the returns by the usual fleets to
him in my name; and a clause in the end, being a grant of 100
moidores a year to him during his life, out of the efi'ects; and
fifty moidores a year to his son after him, for his life. And
thus I requited my old man.

I was now to consider which way to steer my course next,
and what to do with the estate that Providence had thus put
into my hands; and, indeed, I had more care upon my head
now than I had in my silent state of life in the island, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my,
business was how to secure it. I had never a eave to hide my
money in, or a place where it might lie without lock or key, till
it grew mouldy and tarnished before any body would meddle
with it. On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or who to
trust with it; my old patron, the mpuin, indeed, was honest,
and that was the only refuge I had.

In the next place, my interest in the Brad]: seemed to sum--
mon me thither; but now I could not tell how to think of going
thither till I had settled my affairs, and left my efi'ects in some
safe hands behind me. At first I thought of my old friend the
widow, who, I knew, was honest, and would be just to me; but
then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew,
might be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but to go
back to England myself, and take my effects with me.

- It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this;
and therefore as I had rewarded the old eaptain fully, and to
satisfaction, who had been my former benefactor, so Ibegan to
think of my poor widow, whose husband had been my first bene-
factor, and she, while it was in her power, my faithful steward
and instructor. So the first thing I did, I got a merchant in
Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not only to pay
a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in money a hundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her
powrty, by telling her she should, if I lived, have a further
supply. At the same time I sent my two sisters in the country,
each of them a hundred pounds, they being, though not in want,
yet not in very good circumstances; one having been married,
and left a widow; and the other having a husband not so kind
to her as he should be.

But among all my relations or acquaintances, I could not yet
pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my stock,
that I might go away to the 87113173, and leave things safe behind
me; and this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brasilr, and have
settled myself there, for I was, as it were, naturalized to the
place; but I had some little scruple in my mind about religion,
which inscnsibly drew me back, of which I shall say more pre-
sently. However, it was not religion that kept me from going
there for the present; and as I had made no scruple of being
openly of the religion of the country, all the while I was among
them, so neither did I yet; only that now and then, having of
late thought more of it than formerly, when I began to think of
living and dying among them, I began to regret my having pro-
fcsscd myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best
religion to die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me
from going to the Brasilx, but that really I did not know with
whom to leave my efi'ects behind me; so I resolved at last to go
to England with it, where if I arrived, I concluded I should make
some acquaintance, or find some relations, that would be faithful-

to inc; and accordingly I prepared to go for England with all
my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the
Brasil fleet being just going away) resolved to give answers
suitable to the just and faithful account of things I had from
thence; and first to the prior of St. Augustine, I wrote a letter
full of thanks for their just dealings, and the offer of the 872
moidores, which was undisposed of; which I desired might be
given, 500 to the monastery, and 372 to the poor, as the prior
should direct, desiring the good Padre': prayers for me, and the
like.

I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all
the acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for;
as for sending them any present, they were far above having any
occasion for it.

Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in
the improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the
stock of the works, giving him instructions for his future go-
vernment of my part, according to the powers I had left with
my old patron, to whom I desired him to send whatever became
due to me, till he should hear from me more particularly: assur-
ing him that it was my intention, not only to come to him, but
to settle myself there for the remainder of my life. To this I
added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife
and two daughters, for such the mptain's son informed me he had ;
with two pieces of fine English broad-cloth, the best I could get
in Li'Jbon, five pieces of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a

good value.
Having thus settled my afi'airs, sold my cargo, and turned all

my efi'ects into good bills of exchange, my next dificulty was,
which way to go to England. I had been accustomed enough
to the sea, and yet I had a strange aversion to go to England by
sea at that time; and though I could give no reason for it, yet302 Lira mo Anvau'ruans'

the difficulty increased upon me so much, that though I had
once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my mind,
and that not once, but two or three times.

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might
be some of the reasons. But let no man slight the strong im-
pulses of his own thoughts in cases of such moment. Two of
the ships which I had singled out to go in, I mean more par-
ticularly singled out than any other, that is to say, so as in one
of them to put my things on board, and in the other to have
agreed with the captain; I say, two of these ships miscarried,
viz. one was taken by the dlgerine, and the other was cast away
on the Start, near Torbay, and all the people drowned, except
three; so that in either of those vessels I had been made miser-
able, and in which most, it was hard to say.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to
whom I communicated every thing, pressed me earnestly not to
go by sea; but either to go by land to the Graym, and cross
over the Bay of Rina] to Rachelle, from whence it was but an
easy and safe journey by land to Paris, and so to Calais and
Dover, or to go up to Madrid, and so all the way by land
through Fm

In a word, I was so prepossessed against my going by sea at
all, except from Calai: to Dower, that I resolved to travel all
the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did not
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way; and to make
it more so, my old captain brought an English gentleman, the
son of a merchant in Lida", who was willing to travel with me;
after which, we picked up two more Englixl: merchants also,
and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last going to Par-i:
only; so that we were in all six of us, and five servanm, the two
merchants, and the two Partuguere, contenting themselves with
one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me, I
got an English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my
man Friday, who was too much a stranger to be capable of sup-
plying the place of a servant on the road.

In this manner I set out from Litton : and our company
being very all well mounted and armed, we made a little troop,
whereof did they me the honour to all me captain, as well
because I was the oldest man, as because I had two servants, and
indeed was the original of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so shall
I trouble you with none of my land journal. But some adven-
tures that happened to us in this tedious and diflicult journey, I
must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to
Spain, were willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain,
and to see what was worth observing; but it being the latter
part of the summer, we hastened away, and set out from Madrid
about the middle of Octoeer. But when we came to the edge
of Navarre, we were alarmed at several towns on the way, with
an account that so much snow was fallen on the French side of
the mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back
to Pampelmm, after having attempted, at an extreme hazard, to
pass on.

When we me to Pampeluua itself, we found it so indeed;
and to me that had been always used to a hot climate, and in-'
deed to countries where we could scarce bear any clothes on, the
cold was insufferable; nor indeed was it more painful than it
was surprising, to come but ten days before out of the Old
Castile, where the weather was not only warm, but very hot,
and immediately to feel a wind from the Pjrmean mountains, so'
very keen, so severely cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger
benumbing and perishing of our fingers and toss.

Poor Friday was really frighted when he saw the mountains

all covered with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never
seen or- felt before in his life. .
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampelum, it con'
tinued snowing with so much violence, and so long, that the
people said, winter was come before its time; and the roads,
which were difficult before, were now quite impassable: in a
word, the snow lay in some places too thick for us to travel;
and being not hard frozen, as is the case in northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of being buried alive
every step. We staid no less than twenty days at Pampeluna ,-
when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its
being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that
had been known in the memory of man) I proposed that we
should all go away to Fontarabia, and there take shipping for
Bourdeaux, which was a very little voyage.

But while we were considering this, there came in four French
gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the Franc/1 side of the
passes, as we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who
traversing the country near the head of Lauguedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by such ways, that they were not much
incommoded with the snow; and where they met with snow in
any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough to bear them
and their horses.

We sent for this guide, who told us, he would undertake to
carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow, provided
we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild beasts;
for he said, upon these great snows, it was frequent for some
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being

made ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with
snow. We told him we were well enough prepared for such

creatures as they were, if he would insure us from a kind of two-
legged wolves, which we were told we were in most danger from,
especially on the French side of the mountains.

He satisfied us there was no danger of that kind in the way
that we were to goi so we readily agreed to follow him: as did
also twelve other gentlemen, with their servants, some Frau-Ia,
some Spanish, who, as I said, had attempted to go, and were
obliged to come back again.

Accordingly We all set out from Pampeluna, with our guide,
on the fifteenth of November, and indeed, I was surprised, when,
instead of going forward, he came directly back with us, on the
same road that we came from Madrid, above twenty miles;
when having passed two rivers, and come into the plain country,
we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the country
was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but on a sudden, turning
to his left, he approached the mountains another way; and
though it is true, the hills and the precipices looked dreadful,
yet he made so many tours, such meanders, and led us by such
winding ways, we insensibly passed the height of the mountains,
without being much incumbered with the snow; and all on a
sudden he shewed us the pleasant fruitful provinces of Languedar
and Gasm'gne, all green and flourishing; though indeed it was
at a great distance, and we had some rough way to pass yet.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed
one whole day and a night, so fast, that we could not travel;
but he bid us be easy, we should soon be past it all. We found,
indeed,' that we began to descend every day, and to come more
north than before ; and so, depending upon our guide, we went on.

It was about two hours before night, when our guide being
something before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three
monstrous wolves, and after them a bear, out of a hollow way,

adjoining to a thick wood: two of the wolves flew upon the
guide, and had he been half a mile before us, he had been de-

voured indeed, before we could have helped him: one of them
fastened upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with that
violence that he had not time, or not presence of mind enough,
to draw his pistol, but hallooed. and cried out to us most lustily;
My man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride up, and see0,,

306 LII-'2 AND Anne-runes

what was the matter. As soon as Friday came in sight of the
man, he hallooed, as loud as the other, 0 master I O mater!
But, like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and
with his pistol shot the wolf that attacked him into the had.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday ,-
for he, having been used to that kind of creature in his country,
had no fear upon him, but went close up to him, and shot him
as above; whereas any of us would have fired at a farther dis-
tance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf, or endangered
shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I, and
indeed it alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of
Friday's pistol, we heard on both sides the dismallest howling of
wolves, and the noise redoubled by the echo of the mountains,
that it was to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of
them; and perhaps indeed there was not such a few, as that we
had no cause of apprehensions.

However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the other, that had
fastened upon the horse, left him immediately, and fled, having
happily fastened upon his head, where the bosses of the bridle
had stuck in his teeth, so that he had not done him much hurt:
the man, indeed, was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit
him twice, once on the arm, and the other time a little above
his knee; and he was just as it were tumbling down by the
disorder of the horse, when Friday came up, and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose, that at the noise of Friday's pistols we
all mended our pace, and rid up as fast as the way (which was
very difficult) would give us leave, to see what was the matter:
as soon as we came clear of the trees, which blinded us before,
we saw plainly what had been the case, and how Friday had
disengaged the poor guide; though we did not presently discern
what kind of creature it was he had killed.

But never was a fight managed so hardily, and m such a sur-
prising manner, as that which followed between Friday and the
bear, which gave us all (though at first we were surprised and
afraid for him) the'greatest diversion imaginable; as the bear is
a heavy, clumsy creature, and does not gallop as the wolf does,
who is swift and light; so he has two particular qualities, which
generally are the rule of his actions; first as to men, who are
not his proper prey, I say not his proper prey, because though I
cannot say what excessive hunger might do, which was now their
case, the ground being all covered with snow; yet as to men,
he does not usually attempt them, unless they first attack him;
on the contrary, if you meet him in the woods, if you do not
meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; yet then you
must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road;
for he is a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of the
way for a prince; nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is
to look another way, and keep going on; for sometimes, if you
stop, and stand still, and look stedfastly at him, he takes it for
an affront; and if you throw or toss any thing at him, and it
hits him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger,
he takes it for an affront, and sets all other business aside to .
pursue his revenge; for he will have satisfaction in point of
honour, and this is his first quality; the next is, that if he be
once afi'ronted, he will never leave you, night or day, till he has
his revenge, but follows at a good round rate till he overtakes
on.
Y My man Friday had delivered our guide, and when we came
up to him, he was helping him off from his horse; for the man
was both hurt and frighted, and indeed the last more than the
first; when, on the sudden we spied the bear come out of the
wood, and a vast monstrous one it was, the biggest by far that
ever I saw: wewere all a littlesurprisedwhenwesawhim; but
when Friday saw him, it was easy to see joy and courage in the
fellow's countenance: 0! O_! 0! says Friday, three times,
pointing to him, 0 master! you give me te leave, me shake? I:
hand with lxim, me make you good laugh.

I was surprised to see the fellow so pleased, I ou fool you, says
I, he will eat you up. Eatee me up ! eatee me up! says Friday,
twice over again; Me eatee him up; me make you good laugh ;
you all stay here, me shew you good laugh: so down he sits,
and gets his boots or? in a moment, and put on a pair of pumps
(as we call the flat shoes they wear) and which he had in _his
pocket, gives my other servant his horse, and, with his gun,
away he flew, swift like the wind.

The bear was walking softly on, and offered to meddle with
nobody, till Friday coming pretty near, calls to him, as if the
bear could understand him: Hark ye, liar/t ye, says Friday, me
:pea/eee wit you. We followed at a distance; for now being
come down on the Garcoigne side of the mountains, we were
entered a vast great forest, where the country was plain, and
pretty open, though many trees in it scattered here and there.

Friday, who had, as we say, the heels of the bear, came up
with him quickly, and takes up a great stone, and throws at him,
and it hit him just on the head; but did him no more harm than
if he had thrown it against a wall; but it answered Friday': end;
for the rogue was so void of fear, that he did it purely to make
the bear follow him, and shew us some laugh, as he called it.

As soon as the bear felt the stone, and saw him, he turns
about, and comes after him, taking devilish long strides, and
shuffling along at a strange rate, so as Would put a horse to a
middling gallop: away runs Friday, and takes his course, as if
he ran towards us for help; so we all resolved to fire at once
upon the bear, and deliver my man ; though I was angry at him
heartily for bringing the bear back upon us, when he was going
about his own business another way; and especially I was angry
that he had turned the bear upon us, and then run away; and I
called out, You dog, said I, i: (Iii: your making u: laugh 1? Come
may, and take your horse, that we may shoot the creation. He
hears me, and cries out, No shoot, no shoot, stand .m'll, you get
math laugh.- and as the nimble creature ran two foot for the
beast's one, he tumed on a sudden, on one side of us, and seeing
a great oak tree, fit for his purpose, he beckoned to us to follow,
and doubling his pace, he gets nimbly up the tree, laying his gun
down upon the ground, at about five or six yards from the bottom
of the tree.

The bear soon came to the tree, and we followed at a distance;
the first thing he did, he stopped at the gun, smelt to it, but let
it lie, and up he scrambles into the tree, climbing like a eat,
though so monstrously heavy. I was amazed at the folly, as I
thought it, of my man, and could not for my life see any thing
to laugh at yet, till seeing the bear get up the tree, we all rode
nearer to him.

When we came to the tree, there was Friday got out to the
small end of a large limb of the tree, and the bear got about
half way to him; as soon as the bear got out to that part where
the limb of the tree was weaker, Ha, says he to us, now you :2:
on: loathe: the hear dance; so he falls ajumping, and shaking the
bough, at which the bear began to totter, but stood still, and
began to look behind him, to see how he should get back; then
indeed we did laugh heartily. But Friday had not done with
him by a gut deal: when he sees him stand still, he calls out
to him again, as if he had supposed the bear could speak English,
What, you (Me no further ? Pray you torn: further. So he left
jumping and shaking the trees; and the bear, just as if he un-
derstood what he said, did come a little further; then he fell a
jumping again, and the bear stopped again.

.We thought now was a good time to knock him on the head,
and I ealled to Friday to stand still, and we would shoot the
bear; but he cried out earnestly, 0 pray! 0 pray! no .rhoot, on:
shoot by and then; he would have said by and bye. However, to
shorten the story, Friday danced so much, and the bear stood so
ticklish, that we had laughing enough indeed, but still could not
imagine what the fellow would do; for first we thought he de-
pended upon shaking the bear off; and we found the bar was
too cunning for that too; for he would not go out far enough
to be thrown down, but clings fast with his great broad claws and
feet, so that we could not imagine what would be the end of it,
and where the jest would be at last.

But Friday put us out of doubt quickly , for seeing the bear
cling fast to the bough, and that he could not be persuaded to
come any farther, Well, well, says Friday, you no come farther,
me go, me go; you no come to me, me go corn: to you; and upon
this he goes out to the smallest and of the bough, where it would
bend with his weight, and gently lets himself down by it, sliding
down the bough till he came near enough to jump down on his
feet, and away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and stands still.

Well, said I to him, Friday, what will you do now? Why
don't you shoot him: No 5/2001, says Friday, no yet ,- rne .rlzoot
now me no kill ,- me stay give you one more laugh ; and indeed so
he did, as you will see presently; for when the bear see his
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where he stood, but
did it mighty leisurely, looking behind him every step, and
coming backward till he got into the body of the tree; then with
the same hinder end foremost, he came down the tree, grasping
it with his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very leisurely;
at this juncture, and just before he could set his hind feet upon
the ground, Friday stepped close to him, clapped the muzzle of
his piece into his ear, and shot him as dead as a stone.

Then the rogue turned about, to see if we did not laugh; and
when he saw we were pleased by our looks, he falls a laughing
himself very loud; So we kill bear in my country, says Friday.
50 you kill them, said 1; why you have no guns. No, says he,
no gun, hot .r/zoot great much long arrow
This was, indeed, a good diversion to us, but we were still in
a wild place. and our guide very much hurt, and what to do we
hardly knew; the howling of wolves run much in my head; and
indeed except the noise I once heard on the shore of Africa, of
which I have said something already, I never heard any thing
that filled me with so much horror.

These things, and the approach of night, called us OH", or else,
as Friday would have had us, we should certainly have taken the
skin of this monstrous creature of, which was worth saving; but
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; so we
left him, and went forward on our journey.

The ground was still covered with snow, though not so deep
and dangerous as on the mountains; and the ravenous creatures,
as we heard afterwards, were come down into the forest and plain
country, pressed by hunger, to seek for food, and had done a
great deal of mischief in the villages, where they surprised the
country people, killed a great many of their sheep and horses,.
and some people too.

We had one dangerous place to pass, which our guide told us,
if there were any more wolves in the country, we should find '
them there; and this was in a small plain, surrounded with woods
on every side, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we were
to pass to get through the wood, and then we should come to
the village where we were to lodge.

It was within half an hour of sunset when we entered the first
wood; and a little after sunset when we eame into the plain.
We met with nothing in the first wood, except that in a little
plain within the wood, which was not above two furlongs over,
we saw five great wolves cross the road, full speed one after an-
other, as if they had been in chase of some prey, and had it in
view; they took no notice of us, and were gone and out of our
sight in a few moments.

Upon this our guide, who, by the way, was a wretched faint?hearted fellow, bid us keep in a ready posture, for he believed

there were more wolves a coming.

We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us; but we saw
no more wolves till we came through that wood, which was mar
half a league, and entered the plain; as soon as we came into
the plain, we had occasion enough to look about us. The first
object we met with was a dead horse, that is to say, a poor horse
which the wolves had killed, and at least a dozen of them at
work: we could not say eating of him, but picking of his bones
rather; for they had eaten up all the flesh before.

We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither
did they take much notice of us. Friday would have let fly at
them, but I would not suffer him by any means; for I found we
were like to have more business upon our hands than we were
aware of. We were not gone half over the plain, but we began
to hear the wolves howl in the wood on our left, in a frightful
manner; and presently after we saw about a hundred coming on
directly towards us, all in a body, and most of them in a line, as
regularly as an army drawn up by experienced ofiicers. I scarce

' knew in what manner to receive them ; but found to draw our-

selves in a close line, was the only way; so we formed in a
moment; but, that we might not have too much interval, I
ordered, that only every other man should fire; and that the
others who had not fired, should stand ready to give them a
second volley immediately, if they continued to advance upon
us; and that then those who had fired at first, should not pretend
to load their fusils again, but stand ready, with every one a pis-
tol, for we were all armed with a fusil, and a pair of pistols each
man; so we were, by this method, able to fire six volleys, half
of us at a time ; however, at present, we had no necessity; for,
upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being
terrified, as well with the noise as with. the fire; four of them
being shot into the head, dropped ; several others were wounded,
and went bleeding of, as we could see by the snow: I found
they stopped, but did not immediately retreat; whereupon re-
membering that I had been told, that the fiercest creatures were
terrified at the voice of a man, I caused all our company to halloo
as loud as we could, and I found the notion not altogether mis-
taken; for upon our shout, they began to retire, and turn about;
then I ordered a second valley to be fired in their rear, which
put them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.

This gave us leisure to charge our pieces again, and that we
might lose no time, we kept going; but we had but little more
than loaded our fusils, and put ourselves into a readiness, when
we heard a terrible noise in the same wood, on our left; only
that it was further onward the same way we were to go.

The night was coming on, and the light began to be dusky,
which made it the worse on our side; but the noise increasing,
we could easily perceive that it was the howling and yelling of
those hellish creatures; and, on a sudden, we perceived two or
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind us, and one on
our front, so that we seemed to 'be surrounded with them ; how-
ever, as they did not fall upon us, we kept our way forward, as
fast as we could make our horses go, which, the way being very
rough, was only a good large trot; and in this manner we earne
in view of the entrance of a wood through which we were to pass,
at the farther side of the plain; but we were greatly surprised,
when, coming nearer the lane, or pass, we saw a confused num-
ber of wolves standing just at the entrance.

On a sudden, at another opening of the Wood, we heard the
noise of a gun; and, looking that way, out rushed a horse, with
a saddle and bridle on him, flying like the wind, and sixteen or
seventeen wolves after him full speed; indeed the horse had-the
heels of them; but as we supposed that he could not hold it at
that rate, we doubted not but they would get up with him at
last; and no question but they did.

0
But here we had a most horrible sight; for, riding up to the
entrance where the horse came out, we found the carcase of an-
other horse, and of two men devoured by the ravenous creatures,
and one of the men was no doubt the same who we heard fired
the gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the
man, his head, and the upper part of his body, was eaten up.

This filled us with horror, and we knew not what course to
take; but the creatures resolved us soon, for they gathered about
us presently, in hopes of prey; and I verily believe there were
three hundred of them. It happened very much to our advan-
tage, that at the entrance into the Wood, but a little way from it,
there lay some large timber trees, which had been cut down the
summer before, and l suppose lay there for carriage; ldrew my
little troop in among those trees, and placing ourselves in a line
behind one long tree, I advised them all to alight, and keeping
that tree before us, for a breast-work, to stand in a triangle, or
three fronts, inclosing our horses in the centre.

We did so, and it was Well we did: for never was a more
furious charge than the creatures made upon us in the place;
they came on us with a growling kind of noise, and mounted
the piece of timber (which, as I said, was our breast-work) as
if they were only rushing upon their prey; and this fury of
theirs, it seems, was principally occasioned by their seeing our
horses behind us, which was the prey they aimed at: I ordered
our men to fire, as before, every other man; and they took their
aim so sure, that indeed they killed several of the wolves at the
first volley; but there was a necessity to keep a continual

firing, for they came on like devils, those behind pushing on
those before.

When we had fired our second volley of our fusils we thought
they stopped a little, and I hoped they would have gone ofl', but
it was but a moment, for others came forward again: so we fired
two volleys of our pistols; and I believe in these four firings,
we had killed seventeen or eighteen of them, and lamed twice as
many; yet they came on again.

I was loth to spend our last shot too hastily; so I called my
servant, not my man Friday, for he was better employed; for,
with the greatest dexterity imaginable, he had charged my fusil
and his own while we were engaged; but, as I said, I called my
other man ; and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him lay a
train all along the piece of timber, and let it be a large train; he
did so, and had but just time to get away, when the wolves came
up to it, and some were got up upon it; when I, snapping an
uncharged pistol close to the powder, set it on fire; those that
were upon the timber were scorched with it, and six or seven of
them fell, or rather jumped in among us, with the force and
fright of the fire; we dispatched these in an instant, and the rest
were so frighted with the light, which the night, for now it w
very near dark, made more terrible, that they drew back a little.

Upon which I ordered our last pistols to be fired off in one
volley, and after that we gave a shout; upon this the wolves
turned tail, and we sallied immediately upon near twenty lame
ones, who we found struggling on the ground, and fell a cutting
them with our swords, which answered our expectation; for the
crying and howling they made were better understood by their
fellows; so that they fled and left us.

We had, first and last, killed about threescore of them; and
had it been day--light, we had killed many more. The field of
battle being thus cleared, we made forward again, for we had
still near a league to go; we heard the ravenous creatures howl
and yell in the woods as we went, several times; and sometimes
we fancied we saw some of them, but the snow dazzling our
eyes, We were not certain; so in about an hour more we eame
to the town where we were to lodge, which we found in a terrible .
fright, and all in arms; for, it seems, that, the night before, the
wolves and some beers had broke into the village in the night,
and put them in a terrible fright; and they were obliged to keep
guard night and day, but especially in the night, to preserve their
cattle, and indeed their people. '

The next morning our guide was so ill, and his limbs so swelled
with the rankling of his two wounds, that he could go no further;
so we were obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Thou-
laure, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful, pleasant coun-
try, and no snow, no wolves, or any thing like them; but when
we told our story at Tlmtlaure, they told us it was nothing but
what was ordinary in the great forest at the foot of the moun-
tains, especially when the snow lay on the ground ; but they in-
quired much what kind of a guide we had gotten, that would
venture to bring us that way in such a severe season; and told
us, it was a great chance we were not all devoured. When we
told them how we placed ourselves, and the horses in the middle,
they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty to one but
we had been all destroyed; for it was the sight of the horses
which made the wolves so furious, seeing their prey; and that at
other times they are really afraid of a gun; but the being exces-
sive hungry, and raging on that account, the eagerness to come
at the horses had made them senseless of danger; and that if we
had not by the continued fire, and at last by the stratagem of the
train of powder, mastered them, it had been great odds but that
we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had we been content to
have sat still on horseback, and fired as horsemen, they would
not have taken the horses so much for their own, when men
were on their backs, as otherwise; and withal they told us, that
at last, if we had stood altogether, and left our horses, they would
have been so eager to have devoured them, that we might have
come off safe, especially having our fire-arms in our hands, and
being so many in number.

For my part, I was never so sensible of danger in my life; for
seeing above three hundred devils come roaring and open-mouthed
to devour us, and having nothing to shelter us, or retreat to, I
gave myself over for lost; and as it was, I believe, I shall never
care to cross those mountains again; I think I would much
rather go a thousand leagues by sea, thoughl were sure to meet
with a storm once a week.

I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in my passage
through France; nothing but what other travellers have given
an account of, with much more advantage than I can. I travelled
from Thouloure to Pari:, and without any considerable stay, me
to Calais, and landed safe at Dover, the fourteenth of femur),
after having had a severe cold season to travel in.

I was now come to the centre of my travels, and had in a little
time all my new discovered estate safe about me, the bills of
exchange, which I brought with me, having been very currently
paid.

My principal guide and privy counsellor, was my good an-
cient widow, who, in gratitude for the moneyI had sent her,
thought no pains too much, or care too great, to employ for me ;
and I trusted her so entirely with every thing, that I was perfectly
easy as to the security of my effects; and indeed I was very
happy from my beginning, and now to the end, in the unspotted
integrity of this good gentlewoman.

And now I began to think of leaving my effects with this
woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the Brasilr: but
now another scruple came in the way, and that was religion; for
as I had entertained some doubts about the Roman religion, even
while I was abroad, especially in my state of solitude; soI knew
there was no going to the Brasilr for me, much less going to
settle there, unless I resolved to embrace the Roman Catholic
religion, without any reserve; unless on the other hand I re
solved to be a sacrifice to my principles, be a martyr for religion,
and die in the Inquisition: so I resolved to stay at home, and if
I could find means for it, to dispose of my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at Liseon, who in
return gave me notice, that he could easily dispose of it there:
but that if I thought fit to give him leave to offer it in my name
to the two merchants, the survivors of my trustees who lived in
the Brasilr, who must fully understand the value of it, who lived
just upon the spot, and who I knew were very rich, so that he
believed they would be fond of buying it; he did not doubt, but
I should make 4 or 5000 pieces of eight the more of it.

Accordingly I agreed, gave him order to offer it to them, and
he did so; and in about eight months more, the ship being then
returned, he sent me account, that they had accepted the offer,
and had remitted 3 3,000 pieces of eight to a correspondent of
theirs at Lisean, to pay for it.

In return I signed the instrument of sale in the form which
they sent from Lisbon, and sent it to my old man, who sent me
bills of exchange for 32,800 pieces of eight for the estate; re-
serving the payment of' 100 moidores a year, to him (the old
man) during his life, and 50 moidores afterwards to his son
for his life, which I had promised them; which the plantation
was to make good as a rent--charge. And thus I have given the
first part of a life of fortune and adventure, a life of Providencc's
chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will seldom be
able to shew the like of: beginning foolishly, but closing much
more happily than any part of it ever gave me leave so much as
to hope for.

Any one would think, that in this state of complieaced good
fortune, I was past running any more hazards, and so indeed I
had been, if other circumstances had concurred: but I was
inured to a wandering life, had no family, not many relations;
nor, however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance; and
though I had sold my estate in the Brasilx, yet I could not keep
the country out of my head, and had a great mind to be on the
wing again; especially I could not resist the strong inclination
I had to see my island, and to know if the poor Spaniard: were
in being there; and how the rogues I left there had used them.

My true friend the widow earnestly dissuaded me from it, and
so far prevailed with me, that almost for seven years she pre-
vented my running abroad; during which time I took my two
nephews, the children of one of my brothers, into my care: the
eldest having something of his own, I bred up as a gentleman,
and gave him a settlement of some addition to his estate, after
my decease; the other I put out to a captain of a ship; and after
five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterprising young fel-
low, I put him into a good ship, and sent him to sea: and this
young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I was, to farther
adventures myself.

In the mean time, I in part settled myself here: for, first of
all, I married, and that not either to my disadvantage or dis-
satisfaction, and had three children, two sons and one daughter:
but my wife dying, and my nephew coming home with good
success from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and
his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go in his ship
as a private trader to the East Indies. This was in the year
16 4..

In this voyage I visited my new colony in the island, saw my
successors the Spaniards, had the whole story of their lives, and
of the villains I left there; how at first they insulted the poor
Spaniards, how they afterwards agreed, disagreed, united, sepa-
rated, and how at last the Spaniard: were obliged to use violence
with them; how they were subjected to the Spaniatdr; how
honestly the Spaniard: used them; a history, if it were entered
into, as full of variety and wonderful accidents as my own part;
particularly also as to their battles with the Caribbeam, who landed
several times upon the island, and as to the improvement they
made upon the island itself; and how five of them made an
attempt upon the main land, and brought away eleven men and32o LIFE AND ADVENTURES or ROBINSON Causon.

five women prisoners; by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young children on the island.

Here I stayed about twenty days; left them supplies of all
necessary things, and particularly of arms, powder, shot, clothes,
tools, and two workmen, which I brought from England with me;
'viz. a carpenter and a smith.

Besides this, I shared the island into parts with them, reserved
to myself the property of the whole, but gave them such parts,
respectively, as they agreed on; and having settled all things
with them, and engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.

From thence I touched at the Brarilr, from whence I sent a
bark, which I bought there, with more people, to the island; and
in it, besides other supplies, I sent seven women, being such as I
found proper for service, or for wives to such as would take
them. As to the Englirltmn, I promised them to send them
some women from England, with a good cargo of necessaries, if
they would apply themselves to planting; which I afterwards
performed: and the fellows proved very honest and diligent,
after they were mastered, and had their properties set apart for
them. I sent them also from the Brasilx, five cows, three of
them being big with calf, some sheep, and some hogs, which,
when I came again, were considerably increased.

But all these things, with an account how 300 Caribbee: came
and invaded them, and ruined their plantations, and how they
fought with that whole number twice, and were at first defeated
and three of them killed; but at last a storm destroying their
enemies' canoes, they famished or destroyed all the rest, and re-
newed and recovered the possession of their plantation, and still
lived upon the island.

All these things, with some very surprising incidents in some
new adventures of my own, for ten years' more,I may, perhaps,
give a. farthc account of hereafter.

they strip it of all those reflections, as well religious as moral,
which are not only the greatest beauties of the Work, but are

Robinson Crusoe.

  

i HAT homely proverb used on so many occa-
' sions in England, viz. That what u hred in
' the bone will not go out of the flesh, was never
, , more verified than in the story of my LIFE.

Any one would think that after thirty-five
' " years' affliction, and a variety of unhappy cir-
cumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through before,
and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulneas
of all things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be allowed
me to have had experience of every state of middle life, and to
know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy;
I say, after all this, any one would have thought that the native
propensity to rambling, which I gave an account of in my first
setting out .into the world to have been so predominant in my
thoughts, should be worn out, the volatile part be fully evacu-
ated, or at least condensed, and I might at sixty-one years of age
have been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done ven--
turing life and fortune any more.

Nay farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was
taken away in me; for I had no fortune to make, I had nothing
to seek: if I had gained ten thousand pound, I had been no
richer; for I had already sufficient for me, and for those I had
to leave it to; and that I had was visibly increasing; for having
no great family, I could not spend the income of what I had,
unless I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as a
great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were
things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had no-
thing indecd to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got,
and see it increase daily upon my hands.

Yet all these things had no effect upon me, or at least not
enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go abroad again,
which hung about me like a chronical distemper; particularly the
desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the colony
I left there, run in my head continually. I dreamed of it all
night, and my imagination run upon it all day; it was upper-
most in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and
strongly upon it, that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, no-
thing could remove it out of my mind; it even broke so vio-
lently into all my discourses, that it made my conversation tire-
some; for I could talk of nothing else, all my discourse run into
it, even to impertinence, and I saw it myself.

I have often heard persons of good judgment say, that all the
stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is
owing to the strength of imagination, and the powerful opera-
tion of fancy in their minds; that there is no such thing as a
spirit appearing, or a ghost walking, and the like; that people's
poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased
friends so realises it to them, that they are capable of fancying
upon some extraordinary circumstances that they see them, talk
to them, and are answered by them, when in truth, there is no-
thing but shadow and vapour in the thing; and they really know
nothing of the matter.

For my part, I know not to this hour, whether there are any
such things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people
after they are dead, or whether there is any thing in the stories
they tell us of that kind, more than the product of vapours, sick
minds, and wandering fancis. But this I know, that my ima-
gination worked up to such a height, and brought me into such
ecstasies of vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actually
supposed myself oftentimes upon the spot, at my old castle be-
hind the trees, saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the
reprobate sailors whom I left upon the island; nay, I fancied I
talked with them, and looked at them so steadily, though I was
broad awake, as at persons just before me; and this I did till I
often fiightened myself with the images my fancy represented to
me: one time in my sleep I had the villany of the three pirate
sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard and Friday':
father, that it was surprising 3 they told me how they barbarously
attempted to murder all the Spaniard:, and that they set fire to
the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve
them, things that I had never heard of, and that indeed were
never all of them true in fact: but it was so warm in my imagi-
nation, and so realised to me, that to the hour I saw them, I
could not be persuaded but that it was or would be me; also
howl resented it when the Spaniard complained to me, and how
I brought them to justice, tried them before me, and ordered
them all three to be hanged: what there was really in this, shall
be seen in its place; for however I came to form such things in
my dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet
there was very much of it true. I say, I own, that this dream
had nothing literally and specifically true; but the general part
was so true, the base and villanous behaviour of these three
hardened rogues was such, and had been so much worse than all
I can describe, that the dream had too much similitude of the
fact; and as I.would afterwards have punished them severely,
so in had hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and
should have been justifiable both by the laws of Goo and man.
But, to return to my story. In this kind of temper I had
lived some years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant
hours, no agreeable diversion but what had something or other
of this in it, so that my wife, who saw my mind so wholly bent
upon it, told me very seriously one night, that she believed there
was some secret powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which
had determined me to go thither again; and that she found no-
thing hindered my going but my being engaged to a wife and
children. She told me, that it was true she could not think of
parting with me; but as she was assured, that if she was dead it
would be the first thing I would do; so, as it seemed to her
that the thing was determined above, she would not be the only
obstruction : for if I thought fit, and resolved to go,----here she
found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very
earnestly at her ; so that it a little disordered her, and she
stopped. I asked her why she did not go on, and say out what
she was going to say? But I perceived her heart was too full,
and some tears stood in her eyes. Speak out, my dear, said I,
are you willing I should go? No, my: 311:, very afmionately,
I am far from willing; but if you are resolved to go, says she,
and rather than I will be the only hinderance, I will go with you;
for though I think it a preposterous thing for one of your years,
and in your condition, yet if it must be, said she again, weeping,
I won't leave you ; for if it be of Heaven, you must do it; there
is no resisting it; and if Heaven makes it your duty to go, he
will also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of
me, that I may not obstruct it.

This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little
out of the vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing;
I corrected my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself
sedately, what business I had, after threescore years, and after
such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so
happy and easy a manner, I say, what business I had to rush into
new hazards, and put myself upon adventures, fit only for youth
and poverty to run into?
With those thoughts, I considered my new engagement; that
I had a wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child
of another; that I had all the world could give me, and had no
need to seek hazards for gain: that I was declining in years, and
ought to think rather of leaving what I had gained than of seek-
ing to increase it; that as to what my wife had said, of its being
an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go,
I had no notion of that; so after many of these cogitations, I
struggled with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself
out of it, a: I believe people may always do in like eases, if they
will; and, in a word, I conquered it; composed myself with
such arguments as occurred to my thoughts, and which my pre-
sent condition furnished me plentifully with: and particularly,
as the most effectual method, I resolved to divert myself with
other things, and to engage in some business that might efi'ectu-
ally tie me up from any more excursions of this kind; for I
found the thing retum upon me chiefly when I was idle, had
nothing to do, or any thing of moment immediately before me.

To this purpose I bought a little farm in the county of Bed-
ford, and resolved to remove myself thither. I had a little con-
venient house upon it, and the land about it I found was capable
of great improvement, and that it was many ways suited to my
inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting,
and improving of land; and particularly, being an inland coun-
try, I was removed from conversing among ships, sailors, and
things relating to the remote part of the world.

In a word, I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought
me ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon, horses, cows, sheep; and
setting seriously to work, became in one half year, a mere coun-
try gentleman; my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing
my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, 8e.
and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life that nature was
eapable of directing, or that a man always bred to misfortunes
was eapable of being retreated to.
I farmed upon my own land, I had no rent to pay, was limited
by no articles, I could pull up or cut down as I pleased: what I
planted was for myself, and what I improved, was for my family;
and having thus left of? the thoughts of wandering, I had not-the
least discomfort in any part of my life, as to this world. Now
I thought indeed, that I enjoyed the middle state of life that my
father so early recommended to me, a kind of heavenly life,
something like what is described by the poet upon the subject of
a country life.

Free from vices, free from care,
Age has no pain, andyouth no mare.

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unfore-
seen Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a
breach upon me, inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its
consequence, into a deep relapse into the wandering disposition;
which, as I may say, being born in my very blood, soon reco-
vered its hold of me, and, like the returns of a violent distem-
per, came on with an irresistible force upon me; so that nothing
could make any more impression upon me. This blow was the
loss of my wife.

It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife, to
give a character of her particular virtues, and make my court to
the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon. She was, in a few
words, the stay of all my afi'airs, the centre of all my enterprises,
the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that happy com-
pass I was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that
fluttered in my head as above; and did more to guide my ram-
bling genius, than a mother's tears, a father's instructions, a
friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could do. I
was happy in listening to her tears, and in being moved by her
entmties, and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the
world by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me;
Iwasasmuch astrangerinit,inmythoughts, as Iwasinthe
3745i]: when I went first on shore there; and as much alone,
eitceptastotheassismnceofservants,aslwasinmyisland. I
knew neither what to do, or what not to do. I saw the world
busy round me, one part labouring for bread, and the other part
squandering in vile exceeses'or empty pleasures, equally misera-
ble, because the end they proposed still fled from them ; for the
man of pleasure every day surfeited of his vice, and heaped up
work for sorrow and repentance; and the men of labour spent
their strength in daily strugglings for bread to maintain the vital
strength they laboured with; so living in a daily circulation of
sorrow, living but to work, and working but to live, as if daily
bread were the only end of wearisome life, and a wearisome life
the only oceasion of daily bread.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the
island; where I suffered no more com to grow, beeause I did
not want it; and bred no more goats, because I had no more
use for them: where the money lay in the drawer till it grew
~mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked upon in twenty
years.

All these things, had I improved them as I ought to have
done, and as reason and religion had dicmmd to me, would have
taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full
felicity, and that there was something which certainly was the
reason and end of life, superior to all these things, and which was
either to he possessed, or at least hoped for, on this side the grave.

But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without
a pilot, that could only run before the wind; my thoughts run
all away again into the old affair, my head quite was turned with
the whimsies of foreign adventures ; and all the pleasant inno-
cent amusements of my farm and my garden, my eattle, and my
Family, which before entirely possest me, were nothing to me,
had no relish, and were like music to one that has no ear, or food
to one that has no taste. In a word, I resolved to leave of
house-keeping, let my farm, and return to London : and in a few
months after I did so.

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before;
I had no relish to the place, no employment in it, nothing to do
but to saunter about like an idle person, of whom it may be said,
he is perfectly useless in 600's creation, and it is not one farthing
matter to the rest of his kind, whether he be dead or alive. This
also was the life which of all circumstances of life was the most
my aversion, who had been all my days used to an active life;
and I would often say to myself A state of idleness i: the very
drag: 0f life; and indeed I thought I was much more suitably
employed, when I was twenty six days a making me a deal
board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew,
who, as I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea,
and had made him commander of a ship, was come home from
a short voyage to Bileoa, being the first he had made; he came
to me, and told me, that some merchants of his acquaintance had
been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the Ear!
Indie: and to China as private traders; and now, uncle, says he,
if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you upon
your old habitation in the island, for we are to touch at the
Brasilr.

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of 'a future state, and
of the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of
second causes with the ideas of things which we form in our
minds, perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the
world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wander-
ing was returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had
in his thoughts to say, when that very morning before he came
to me I had, in a great deal of confusion of thought, and revolv-
ing every part of my circumstances in my mind, come to this
resolution, viz. That I would go to Lisban, and consult with my
old sea captain ; and so, if it was rational and practicable, I would
go and see the island again, and see what was become of my
people there. I had pleased myself with the thoughts of peo-
pling the place, and carrying inhabitants from hence, getting a
patent for the possession, and I know not what; when in the
middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have said, with his
project of carrying me thither, in his way to the Ear! Indies.

I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him,
What devil, said I, sent you of this unlueb' errand ? My nephew
stared, as if he had been frighted at first; but perceiving I was
not much displeased with the proposal, he recovered himself.
I hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, Sir, says he; I dare
say you would be pleased to see your new colony there, where
you once reigned with more felicity than most of your brother
monarchs in the world.

In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, that
is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have
said so much, that I told him, in few words, if he agreed with
the merchants, I would go with him: but I told him, I would
not promise to go any further than my own island. Why, Sir,
says he, you don't want to be left there again, I hope? Why,
said I, an you not take me up again on your return? He told
me it could not be possible that the merchants would allow him
to come that way with a loaden ship of such value, it being a
month's sail out of his way, and might be three or four. Be-
sides, Sir', if I should miscarry, said he, and not return at all,
then you would be just reduced to the condition you were in
before.

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for
it, which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which,
being taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship, might, by
the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to earry with us,
beset upagainintheisland; andfinished,fittogotosea,ina
few days.
I was not long resolving; for indeed the importunities of my
nephew joined in so effectually with my inclination, that nothing
could oppose me: on the other hand, my wife being dead, I had
nobody concerned themselves so much for me, as to persuade
me one way or other, except my ancient good friend the widow,
who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years, my easy
circumstances, and the needless hazard of a long voyage; and,
above all, my young children : but it was all to no purpose; I
had an irresistible desire to the voyage; and I told her I thought
there was something so uncommon in the impressions I had upon
my mind for the voyage, that it would be a kind of resisting
Providence, if I should attempt to stay at home; after which
she ceased her expostulations, and joined with me, not only in
making provision for my voyage, but also in settling my family
affairs in my absence, and providing for the education of my
children.

In order to this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had
in such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that
I was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done
them, whatever might befal me; and for their education, I left
it wholly to my widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself
for her care: all which she richly deserved; for no mother could
have taken more care in their education, or understand it better;
and as she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for
it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of 74mm)
1694-5, and I with my man Friday went on board in the Down:
the 8th, having besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a
very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my
colony, which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to
leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants, whom I poi-posed no
place there, as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon
my own account, while I stayed, and either to leave them there,
or carry them forward, as they should appear willing; particu-
larly I carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy ingeni-
ous fellow who was a cooper by trade, but was also a general
mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels, and hand-
mills to grind corn, was a good turner, and a good pot-maker;
he also made any thing that was proper to make of earth, or of
wood; in a word, we called him our 744% of all trader.

With these I carried a tailor, who had offered himself to go
passenger to the East Indies with my nephew, but afterwards
consented to stay on our new plantation, and proved a most ne-
cessary handy fellow as could be desired, in many other busi-
nesses besides that of this trade; for, as I observed formerly,
necessity arms us for all employments.

My cargo, as near as I can collect, for I have not kept an
account of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of
linen, and some thin English stuffs for clothing the Spaniard:,
that I expected totind there, and enough of them as by my cal-
culation might comfortably supply them for seven years; if I
remember right, the materials which I enrried for clothing them,
with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things as they
could want for wearing, amounted to above 200 pounds, including
some beds, bedding, and household-stuff, particularly kitchen
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, (5t. and near a hundred
pound more in iron-work, nails, tools of every kind, staples,
hooks, hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees, be--
sides some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes,
and two pieces of brass cannon; and because I knew not what
time, and what elm-emities I was providing for, I earried a hun-
dred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron
partofsomepikesand halberts; so,that,inshort,wehada
largemagazine ofall sorts ofstores; and I made mynephew336 Lin AND Auvn'gcazs

carry two small quarter-deck gain: more than he wanted for his
ship, to leave behind, if there was occasion; that when they
came there, we might build a fort, and man it against all sorts
of enemies: and indeed, I at first thought there would be need
enough of it all, and much more, if we hoped to maintain our
possession of the island, as shall be seen in the course of the
story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to
meet with ; and therefore shall have the less occasion to inter-
rupt the reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how
matters went with my colony; yet some odd accidents, cross
winds, and bad weather happened, on this first setting out, which
made the voyage longer than I expected it at first; and I, who
had never made but one voyage, (via) my first voyage to Guinea,
in which I might be said to come back again, as the voyage was
at first designed, began to think the same ill fate still attended
me; and that I was born to be never contented with being on
shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at sea.

Contrary winds first put up to the northward, and we were
obliged to put in at Galway in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound
two-and-twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with the dis--
aster, that provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the
utmost plenty; so that while we lay here we never touched the
ship's stores, but rather added to them ; here also I took in seve-
ral live hogs, and two cows, and calves, which I resolved, if I
had a good passage, to put on shore in my island; but we found
occasion to dispose otherwise of them.

We set out the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very
fair gale of wind for some days. As I remember, it might be
about the aoth of February in the evening late, when the man:
having the watch, came into the round--house, and told us he saw
afiash of fire, and heard a gun fired; and while hewas telling
us of it, a boy came in, and told us the boatswain heard another.
Thisimade us all run out upon the quarter-deck, where for a while
we heard nothing, but in a few minutes we saw a very great light,
and found that there was some very terrible lire at a distance;
immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all
agreed that there could be no land that way, in which the fire
shewed itself, no not for 500 leagues, for it appeared at W. N. W.
Upon this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea;
and as by our hearing the noise of guns just before, we con-
cluded it could not be far off, we stood directly towards it, and
were presently satisfied we should discover it, because the farther
we sailed, the greater the light appeared, though the weather
being hazy we could not perceive any thing but the light for a
while; in about half an hour's sailing, the wind being fair for
us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little,
we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the
middle of the sea.

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at
all acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently recol-
lected my former circumstances, in what condition I was in when
taken up by the Portugal eapmin; and how much more deplo-
. ,rable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this
ship must be if they had no other ship in company with them:
upon this I immediately ordered, that five guns should be fired,
one soon after another, that, if possible, we might give notice to
them that there was help for them at hand, and that they might
endeavour to save themselves in their boat; for though we could
see the flame of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see no-
thing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning
ship drove, waiting for day--light; when on a sudden, to our
great terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up
in the air, and immediately, that is to say, in a few minutes, all
the firewasout, and the rest ofthe ship sunk; thiswas a terri--

P
ble, and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor'men,
who, I concluded, must .be either all destroyed in the ship, or be
in the utmost distress in their boat in the middle of the ocean,
which at present, by reason it was dark, I could not see: how--
ever, to direct them as well as I could, I caused lights to be
hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could, and which
we had lanthorns for; and kept firing guns all the night long;
letting them know by this, that there was a ship not far ofl".
About eight o'clock in the morning, we discovered the ship's
boats, by the help of our perspective glasses ; found there Were
two of them, both thronged with people, and deep in the water;
we perceived they rowed, the wind being against them; that
they saw our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them.
We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know we saw
them; and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on
board; and then made more sail, standing directly to them. In
a little more than half an hour, we came up with them, and, in
a word, took them all in, being no less than sixty-four men, wo-
men, and children ; for there were a great many passengers.
Upon the whole we found it was a French merchant--ship of
300 ton, homeward-bound from Quebec, in the river of Canada. .
The master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship,
how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the steers-
man; but, on his crying out for help, was, as every body thought,
entirely put out: when they found that some sparks of the first
fire had gotten into some part of the ship, so diflicult to come
at, that they could not effectually quench it; till getting in be-
tween the timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded
into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the applieation
they were able to exert.
They had no more to do then but to get into their boats,
which, to their great- comfort, were pretty large; being their
long boat, and a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was
of no great service to them, other than to get some fresh water
and provisions into her, after they had secured their lives from
the fire. They had indeed small hope of their lives by getting
into these boats at that distance fi'om any land; only, as they
said well, that they were escaped from the fire, and had a possi-
bility, that some ship might happen to be at sea, and might take
them in. They had sails, oars, and a compass; and were pre--
paring to make the best of their way back to Newfoundland, the
wind blowing pretty fair; for it blew an easy gale at S. E. by E.
They had as much provisions and water, as, with sparing it so
as to be next door to starving, might support them about twelve
days; in which, if they had no bad weather, and no contrary
winds, the captain said, he hoped he might get the banks of New-
fiundlaud, and might perhaps take some fish to sustain them till
they might go on shore. But there were so many chances
against them in all these cases; such as storms to overset and
founder them; rains and cold to benumb and perish their limbs;
contrary winds to keep them out and starve them; that it must
have been next to miraculous if they had escaped.

In the midst of their consultations, every one being hopeless,
and ready to despair, the captain with tears in his eyes told me,
they were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun
fire, and after that four more; these were the five guns which I
caused to be fired at first seeing the light: this revived their
hearts, and gave them the notice, which, a: about, I desired it
should, 'viz. that there was a ship at hand for their help.

It was upon the hearing these guns, that they took down their
masts and sails; the sound coming from the windward, they re-
solved to lie by till morning. Some time after this, hearing no
more guns, they fired three musquets, one a considerable while
after another; but these, the wind being contrary, we never
heard.

Some time after that again, they were still more agreeably sur--
prised with seeing our lights, and hearing the guns, which, as I
have said, I caused to be fired all the rest of the night: this set
them to Work with their oars to keep their boats a-head, at least
that we might the sooner come up with them; and at last, to
their inexpressiblc joy, they found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the
strange ecstasies, the variety of postures, which these poor de-
livered people run into, to express the joy of their souls at so
unexpected a deliverance. Grief and fear are easily described;
sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and
hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy, a
surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it; there were
some in tears, some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had
been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and
downright lunatic ; some ran about the ship stamping with their
feet, others wringing their hands; some were dancing, some
singing, some laughing, more crying; many quite dumb, not
able to speak a word; others sick and vomiting, several swoon-
ing, and ready to faint ; and a few were crossing themselves and
giving GOD thanks. .

I would not wrong them neither; there might be many that .
were thankful afterward; but the passion was too strong for
them at first; and they were not able to master it; they were
thrown into ecstasies and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a very
few that were composed and serious in their joy.

Perhaps the case may have some addition to it, from the par-
ticular circumstance of that nation they belonged to; I mean the
French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more pas--
sionate, and more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid, than in
other nations. I am not philosopher enough to determine the
cause, but nothing I had ever seen before came up to it: the
ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty ravage, was in, when he-found
his father in the boat, came the nearest to it ; and the surprise of
the master, and his two companions, whom I delivered from the
Villains that set them on shore in the island, came a littleway
towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw
in Friday, or any where else in my life.

It is further observable, that these extravagance: did not shew
themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in different
persons only: but all the variety would appear in a short suc-
cession of moments, in one and the same person. A man that
we saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and con-
founded, should the next minute be dancing and hallooing like
an antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling
his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a
madman! a few moments after that, we should have him all in
tars, then sick, then swooning; and had not immediate help
been had, would in a few moments more have been dead; and
thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or twenty, but with the
greatest part of them; and, if I remember right, our surgeon
was obliged to let above thirty of them blood.

There were two priests among them, one an old man, and the
other a young man; and that which was strangest was, that the
oldest man was the worst.

As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself
safe, he dropped down stone--dead, to all appearance; not the
least sign of life could be perceived in him; our surgeon imme-
diately applied proper remedies to recover him ; and was the only
man in the ship that believed he was not dead: and at length he
opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the
part, so as to warm it as much as possible: upon this the blood,
which only dropped at first, flowed something freely; in three
minutes after, the man opened his eyes ; and about a quarter of
an hour after that, he spoke, grew better, and quite well; after
the blood was stopped, he walked about, told us he was perfectly
well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him, and
was what we call come to himself; about a quarter of an hour
after, they came running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was
bleeding a French woman that had fainted; and told him, the
priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve
the change of his circumstance, and again this put him into an
ecstasy of joy; his spirits whirled about faster than the vessels
could convey them; the blood grew hot and feverish; and the
man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it;
the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but
gave him something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after
some time, operated upon him, and he waked the next morning
perfectly composed and well.

The younger priest behaved with great command of his pas--
sions, and was really an example of a serious well-governed mind;
at his first coming on board the ship, he threw himself flat on
his face, prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance;
in which I unhappily and unscasonably disturbed him, really
thinking he had been in a swoon ; but he spake calmly; thanked
me; told me he was giving GOD thanks for his deliverance;
begged me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to his
Maker, he would give me thanks also.

I was heartily sorry that I disturbed him; and not only left
him, but kept others from interrupting him also; he continued
in that posture about three minutes, or a little more, after I left
him; then came to me, as he had said he would, and, with a
great deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes,
thanked me, that had, under GOD, given him, and so many
miserable creatures their lives. I told him, I had no room to
move him to thank GOD for it, rather than me; but I added,
that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all
men, and that we had as much reason as he to giVe thanks to
Goo, who had blessed us so far as to makeus the instruments
of his mercy to so many of his creatures.f

or Roamsor: Causos. 343

' After this the young priest applied himself to his country
folks; laboured to compose them; persuaded, entreated, argued,
reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the
exercise of their reason; and with some he had success, though
others were, for a time, out of all government of themselves.

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may
be useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for the guiding
themselves in all the extravagances of their passions; for if an
excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the
reach of their reason, what will not the extravagances of anger,
rage, and a provoked mind, carry us to? And indeed, here I
saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of
every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction, as those of sor-
row and anger.

We were something disordered by these extravagances among
our new guests for the first day; but when they had been retired,
lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and
they had slept heartily, as most of them did, they were quite
another sort of people the next day.

Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the
kindness shewn them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are
naturally apt enough to exceed that way. The captain, and one
of the priests, came to me the next day; and desiring to speak
with me and my nephew, the commander, began to consult with
us what should be done with them; and first they told us, that,
as we had saved their lives, so all we had was little enough for a
return to us for that kindness received. The captain said, they
had saved some money and some things of value in their boats,
catched hastily up out of the flames; and if we would accept it,
they were ordered to make an ofl'er of it all to us; they only
desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if pos-
sible, they might get passage to France.

My nephew was for accepting their money at first word, and
to consider what to do with them afterwards; but I over-ruled
him in that part; for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a
strange country; and if the Portugal captain that took me up at
sea had served me so, and took all I had for my deliverance, I
must have starved, or have been as much a slave at the Brasils,
as I had been in Barbary, the being sold to a Manama!" ex-
cepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not much a better master
than a Turk, if not, in some cases, a much worse.

I therefore told the French captain, that we had taken them
up in their distress, it was true; but that it was our duty to do
so, as we were fellow--creatures, and as we would desire to be so
delivered, if we were in the like or any other extremity; that we
had done nothing for them, but what we believed they would
have done for us if we had been in their case, and they in our's;
but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder them;
and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from
them which they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on
shore and leave them; that this would be first to save them from
death, and then kill them ourselves; save them from drowning,
and then abandon them to starving; and therefore I would not
let the least thing be taken from them. As to setting them on
shore, I told them, indeed, that was an exceeding difficulty to us,
for that the ship was bound to the Ear! Indies; and though we
were driven out of our course to the westward a very great way,
and perhaps was directed by Heaven on purpose for their deliver-
ance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage
on this particular account; nor could my nephew, the captain,
answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under charter-
party to pursue his voyage by the way of Brasil:; and all I knew
he could do for them was, to put ourselves in the way of meet:
ing with other ships homeward--bound from the Wm Indies, and
get them passage, if possible, to England or France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind, they
could not but be very thankful for it: but they were in very
great consternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of
being carried away to the Ear! Indies: and they then entreated
me, thatseeinngasdriven so farto thewestward beforeI met
with them, I would at least keep on the same course to the banks
of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with some
ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada,
from whence they eame.

I thought this was but a reuonable request on their part; and
therefore I inclined to agree to it: for indeed I considered, that
to earry this whole company to the East Indies, would not only
be an intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be
ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I
thought it no breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen
accident made absolutely necessary to us ; and in which no one
could say we were to blame; for the laws of Goo and nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats
full of people in such a distressed condition; and the nature of
the thing, as well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged
us to set them on shore somewhere or other for their deliverance;
so I consented that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if
wind and weather would permit; and if not, that I would earry
them to Martinico in the West Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty
good; and as the winds had continued in the points between
N. E. and S. E. a long time, we miwed several opportunities of
sending them to France,- for we met several ships bound to
Europe, whereof two were French, from St. Christopher':; but
they had been so long beating up against the wind, that they
durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting provisions for the
voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take in;
so we were obliged to go on. It was about a week after this,
that we made the banks of Newfoundland, where, to shorten my

9 2
story, we put all our French people on board a bark, which they
hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and afterwards to carry
them to France, if they could get provision to victual themselves
with: when, I say, all the French went on shore, I should re-
member, that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were
bound to the East India, desired to go the voyage with us, and
to be set on shore on the coast of Coramandel, which I readily
agreed to : for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good
reason, as will appear afterwards ; also four of the seamen entered
themselves in our ship, and proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the Wart Indies, steer-
ing away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, some-
times little or no wind at all, when we met with another subject
for our humanity to Work upon, almost as deplorable as that
before.

It was in the latitude of twenty-seven degrees five minutes N.
and the 19th day of March 1694-5, when we spied a sail, our
course S. E. and by S. We soon perceived it was a large vessel,
and that she bore up to us; but could not at first know what to
make of her, till, after coming a little nearer, we found she had
lost her main-top-mast, fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently
she fired a gun as a signal of distress; the weather was pretty
good, wind at N. N. W. a fresh gale, and we soon came to
speak with her.

We found her a ship of Brirlol bound home from Barbadoer,
but had been blown out of the road at Bar-bade", a few days
before she was ready to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the
captain and chief mate were both gone on shore; so that beside
the terror of the storm, they were but in an indifferent case for
good artists to bring the ship home: they had been already nine
weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible storm after the
hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of their
knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost their masts
as above; they told us, they expected to have seen the Bahama
islands, but were then driven away again to the south-est by a
strong gale of wind at N. N. W. the same that blew now, and
having no sails to work the ship with, but a main course, and a
kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up,
they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand
away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all, was, that they were almost
starved for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had
undergone: their bread and flesh was quite gone, they had not
an ounce left in the ship, and had had none for eleven days; the
only relief they had, was, their water was not all spent, and they
had about half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough;
some succades or sweet-meats they had at first, but they were

devoured; and they had seven casks of rum.
There was a youth and his mother, and a maid-servant, on

board, who were going passengers, and thinking the ship was
ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening before the
hurricane began; and, having no provisions of their own left,
they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest; for the
seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves,
had no compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers;
and they were indeed in a condition that their misery is very
hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not
led me, the weather being fair, and the wind abated, to go on
board the ship: the second mate, who upon this occasion com-
manded the ship, had been on board our ship; and he told me
indeed, they had three passengers in the great mbin, that they
were in a deplorable condition: nay, says he, I believe they are
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days; and

was afraid to inquire after them, said he, for I had nothing to
relieve them with.
We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief
we could spare; and indeed I had so far over-ruled things with
my nephew, that I would have victualled them, though we had
gone away to Virginia, or any part of the coast of America, to
have supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of
eating too much, even of that little we gave them: the mate or
commander brought six men with him in his boat; but these
poor Wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak, they
Could hardly sit to their oars: the mate himself was very ill, and
half-starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing from the
men, and went share and share alike with them in every bit
they eat.

I cautioned him to eat sparingly, but set meat before him im-
mediately, and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began
to be sick, and out of order ; so he stopt awhile, and our surgeon
mixed him up something with some broth, which he said would
be to him both food and physic; and after he had taken it, he
grew better; in the mean time I forgot not the men; I ordered
victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured
than eat it; they were so exceeding hungry, that they were in a
kind ravenous, and had no command of themselves; and two of
them eat with so much greediness, that they were in danger of
their lives the next morning.

The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me,
and brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of, at my
first coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least
mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any; besides the
hourly apprehension I had of being made the food of other
creatures. But all the while the mate was thus relating to me
the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put
out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor
creatures in the great cabin; (viz) the mother, her son, and the
maid servant, who he had heard nothing of for two or three days;
and who he seemed to confess they had wholly neglected, their
own extremities being so great; by which I understood, that
they had really given them no food at all; and that therefore
they must be perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor
or deck of the cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, who we then called captain, on
board with his men to refresh them, so I also forgot not the
starving crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat
to go on board the ship, and with my mate and twelve men to

carry them a sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to
boil. Our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be
boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room to
prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot
before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very
little at a time; and by this caution he preserved the men, who
would otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that
was given them on purpose to save their lives.

At the same time, I ordered the mate to go into the great
cabin, and see what condition the poor passengers were in, and,
if they were alive, to comfort them and give them what refresh-
ment was proper; and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher
with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate
that was on board, and which he did not question would restore
them gradually.

I was not satisfied with this; but as I said above, having a
great mind to see the scene of misery which I knew the ship
itself would present me with, in a more lively manner than I
could have it by report, I took the captain of the ship, as we
now called him, with me, and went myself a little after in their
boat.
I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the
victuals out of the boiler before itwas ready: but my mate
observed his order, and kept a good guard at the cook-room
door; and the man he placed there, after using allpmible per-
suasion to have patience, kept them off by force; however, he
caused some biscuit takes to be dipped in the pot, and softened
with the liquor of the meat, which they call brewis, and gave
them every one one, to stay their stomachs, and told them it was
for their own safety, that he was obliged to give them but a little
at a time. But it was all in vain, and had I not come on board,
and their own commander and officers with me, and with good
words, and some threats also of giving them no more, I believe
they would have broke into the cook--room by force, and tore
the meat out of the furnace; for words are indeed of very small
force to a hungry belly: however we pacified them, and fed
them gradually and cautiously for the first time, and the next
time gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the
men did well enough.

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of
another nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the ship's
company had so little for themselves, it was but too true, that
they had at first kept them very low, and at last totally neg--
lected them; so that for six or seven days, it might be said,
they had really had no food at all, and for several days before
very little.

The poor mother, who, as the men reported, was a woman
of good sense, and good breeding, had spared all she could get
so affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sunk under
it: and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the
floor or deck, with her back up against the sides, between two
chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her
shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said
all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a spoon put
some broth into her mouth: she opened her lips, and lifted up
one hand, but could not speak: yet she understood what he said,
and made signs to him, intimating, that it was too late for her,
but pointed to her child, as if she would have said, they should
take care of him.

However the mate, who was exceedingly moved with the
sight, endeavoured to get some of the ,broth into her mouth;
and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down, though I ques-
tion whether he could be sure of it or not: but it was too late,
and she died the same night.

The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most affec-
tionate mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a cabin-
bed as one stretched out,-with hardly any life left in him; he
had a piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the
rest of it; however, being young, and having more strength than
his mother, the mate got something down his throat, and he
began sensibly to revive, though, by giving him some time after
but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and
brought it up again.

But the next care was the poor maid: she lay all along upon
the deck hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen
down with an apoplexy, and struggled for life: her limbs were
distorted, one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair,
and she griped it so hard that we could not easily make her let
go; her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both together,
set fast against the frame of the abin--mble: in short, she lay just
like one in the last agonies of death, and yet she was alive too.

The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and
terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us
afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, who she saw
dying two or three days before, and who she loved most ten-
derly.

We knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our
surgeon, who was a man of very great knowledge and expe~
rience, and with great application recovered her as to life, he
had her upon his hand as to her senses, for she was little less
than distracted for a considerable time afier; as shall appear
presently.

Whoever shall read these memorandums, must be desired to
consider, that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country,
where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place.
Our business was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not
to lie by for them; and though they were willing to steer the
same course with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail to
keep pace with a ship that had no masts: however, as their cap-
tain begged of us to help him to set up a main top--mast, and a
kind of a top--mast to his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie
by him for three or four days; and then having given him five
barrels of beef, a barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a
proportion of peas, flour, and what other things we could spare;
and taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of
eight of them for satisfaction, we left them, taking on board
with us, at their own earnest request, the priest, the youth, and
the maid, and all their goods.

The young lad was about seventeen years of age; a pretty,
well-bred, modest, and sensible youth: greatly dejected with the
loss of his mother, and, as it seems, had lost his father but a few
months before at Barbadoer. He begged of the surgeon to
speak to me, to take him out of the ship; for he said, the cruel
fellows had murdered his mother; and indeed so they had, that
is to say, passively,- for they might have spared a small suste-
nance to the poor helpless widow, that might have preserved her
life, though it had been but just to keep her alive. But hunger
knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no right; and therefore
is remorseless, and capable of no compassion.

The surgeon told him how far we were going, and how it
would any him away from all his friends, and put him perhaps
in as bad circumstances, almost as those we found him in; that
is to say, starving in the world. He said he mattered not whi-
ther he went, if he was but delivered from the terrible crew he
was among: that the captain (by which he meant me, for he
could know nothing of my nephew) had saved his life, and he
was sure would not hurt him; and as for the maid, he was sure,
if she came to herself, she would be very thankful for it, let us
carry them where we would. The surgeon represented the case
so affectionately to me, that I yielded, and we took them both
on board with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar,
which could not be removed, or come at; and as the youth had
a bill of lading for them, I made his commander sign a writing,
obliging him to go, as soon as he came to Bristol, to one Mr.
Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the youth said he was re-
lated, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to him, and all the
goods he had belonging to the deceased widow: which I sup-
pose was not done, for I could never learn that the shipcame to
Britta],- but was, as is most probable, lost at sea, being in so
disabled a condition, and so far from any land, that I am of
opinion, the first storm she met with afterwards, she might
founder in the sea; for she was leaky, and had damage in her
hold when we met with her. '

I was now in the latitude of 19 deg. 32 min. and had hitherto
had a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the winds
had been contrary. I shall trouble nobody with the little inci-
dents of wind, weather, currents, Cit. on the rest of our voyage;
but, shortening my story for the sake of what is to follow, shall
observe, that I came to my old habitation, the island, on the
Ioth of April, 1695. It was with no small difficulty that I
found the place; for as I came to it, and went from it before,
on the south and east side of the island, as coming from the
Brasilr, so now coming in between the main and the island, and
having no chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I did not know
it when I saw it, or know whether I saw it or no.
We beat about a great while, and went on shore on several
islands in the mouth of the great river Oroonaque, but none for
my purpose; only this I learned by my coasting the shore, that
I was under one great mistake before, <<#2. that the continent
which I thought I saw from the island I lived in, was really no
continent, but a long island, or rather a ridge of islands reaching
from one to the other side of the extended mouth of that great
river; and that the savages who came to my island, were not
properly those which we all Caribbean but islanders, and other
barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited something nearer to
our side than the rest.

In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose;
some I found were inhabited, and some were not. On one of
them I found some Spaniardr, and thought they had lived there;
but speaking with them, found they had a sloop lay in a small
creek hard by, and they came hither to make salt, and catch
some pearl-muscles, if they could ; but they belonged to the Isle
de Trinidad, which lay further north, in the latitude of IO and
I I degrees.

But at last coasting from one island to another, sometimes
with the ship, sometimes with the Frenthman': shallop (which
we had found a convenient boat, and therefore kept her with
their very good will), at length I came fair on the south-side of
my island, and I presently knew the very countenance of the
place; so I brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside with
the little creek where was my old habitation.

As soon as I saw the place, I called for Friday, and asked
him if he knew where he was? He looked about a little, and
presently 'clapping his hands, cried, 0 yes, 0 there, 0 ye:, 0
there! pointing to our old habitation, and fell a dancing and
mpering like a mad fellow; and Ihad much ado to keep him

from jumping into the sea, to swim on shore to the place.
Well, Friday, says I, do you think we shall find' any body
here, or no? and what do you think, shall we see your father?
The fellow stood mute as a stock'a good while; but when I
named his father, the poor afi'ectionate creature looked dejected;
and I could see the tears run down his face very plentifully.
What is the matter, Friday, said I? are you troubled because
you may see your father? No, no, say: he, shaking his head, no
see him more, no ever more see again. Why :0, said 1, Friday ?
how do you know that? 0 no, 0 no, says Friday, he long ago
die; long ago, he much old man. Well, well, ray: I, Friday,
you don't know; but shall we see any one else then? The fel~
low, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points just to the
hill above my old house; and though we lay half a league ofi",
he cries out, We see! we see! yes, we see much man there, and
there, and there. I looked, but I could see nobody, no, not
with a perspective glass; which was, I suppose, because I could
not hit the place; for the fellow was right, as I found upon
inquiry the next day, and there were five or six men altogether
stood to look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us.

As soon as Friday had told me he saw people, I mused the
English ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them
notice we were friends; and about half a quarter of an hour
after, we perceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek; so
I immediately ordered a boat out, taking Friday with me; and,
hanging out a white flag, or flag of truce, I went directly on
shore, taking with me the young friar I mentioned, to whom I
had told the whole story of my living there, and the manner of it,
and every particular, both of myself, and those I left there; and
who was on that account extremely desirous to go with me. We
had besides about sixteen men very well armed, if we had found
any new guest there which we did not know of: but we had no
need of weapons.

As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water,
we rowed directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my
eye upon, was the Spaniard, whose life I had saved, and who I
knew by his face perfectly well; as to his habit, I shall describe
it afterwards. I ordered nobody to go on shore at first but
myself; but there was no keeping Friday in the boat: for the
affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance, a good
way off of the Spaniards, where indeed I saw nothing of him;
and if they had not let him go on shore, he would have jumped
into the sea. He was no sooner on shore, but he flew away to
his father like an arrow out of a bow. It would have made any
man have shed tears, in spite of the firmest resolution, to have
seen the first transports of this poor fellow's joy, when he came
to his father; how he embraced him, kissed him, stroked his
face, took him up in his arms, set him down upon a tree, and
lay down by him; then stood and looked at him as any one
would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour together;
then lie down upon the ground, and stroke his legs and kiss
them, and then get up again, and stare at him; one would have
thought the fellow bewitched; but it would have made a dog
laugh to see how the next day his passion run out another way:
in the morning he walked along the shore, to-and-again, with his
father, several hours, always leading him by the hand, as if he
had been a lady; and every now-and-then he would come to
fetch something or other for him from the boat, either a lump of
sugar or a dram, a biscuit cake, or something or other that was
good. In the afternoon his frolics ran another way; for then he
would set the old man down upon the ground, and dance about
him, and make a thousand antic postures and gestures; and all
the while he did this, he would be talking to him, and telling
him one story or another of his travels, and of what had hap-
pened to him abroad, to divert him. In short, if the same filial
afi'ection was to be found in Christians to their parents, in our
parts of the world, one would be tempted to say, there would
hardly have been any need of the fifth commandment.

But this is a digression; I return to my landing. It would
be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that
the Spaniard: received me with. The first Spaniard, who, as I
said, I knew very well, was he whose life I had saved : he came
towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce
also; and he did not only not know me at first, but he had no
thoughts, no notion, of its being me that was come, till I spoke
to him. Seignior, said I in Portugtme, do you not know me?
at which he spoke not a word; but giving his musquet to the
man that was with him, threw his arms abroad, and saying some-
thing in Spanish that I did not perfectly hear, comes forward
and embraced me, telling me, he was inexcusable not to know
that face again that he had once seen, as of an angel from heaven
sent to save his life : he said abundance of very handsome things,
as a well bred Spaniard always knows how; and then beckoning
to the person that attended him, bade him go and call out his
comrades. He then asked me if I would walk to my old habi-
tation, where he would give me possession of my own house
again, and where I should see there had been but mean improve-
ments. So I walked along with him; but, alas! I could no
more find the place again, than if I had never been there; for
they had planted so many trees, and placed them in such a pos-
ture, so thick and close to one another, in ten years time they
were grown so big, that, in short, the place was inaccessible, ex-
cept by such windings, and blind ways, as they themselves only
who made them could find.

I asked them, what put them upon all these fortifications?
He told me, I would say there was need enough of it, when they
had given me an account how they had passed their time since
their arriving in the island, especially after they had the misfor-
tune, to find that I was gone: he told me he could not but have
some satisfaction in my good fortune, when he heard that I was
gone away in a good ship, and to my satisfaction; and that he
had oftentimes a strong persuasion, that one time or other he
should see me again; but nothing that ever befel him in his life,
he said, was so surprising and afflicting to him at first, as the
disappointment he was under when he came back to the island,
and found I was not there.

As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left
behind, and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me; the
Spaniard: all thought themselves much better among the savages,
only that their number was so small. And, says he, had they
been strong enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory; and
with that he crossed himself on the breast. But, Sir, says he, I
hope you will not be displeased, when I shall tell you how, forced
by necessity, we were obliged, for our own preservation, to dis-
arm them, and make them our subjects, who would not be con-
tent with being moderately our masters, but would be our mur-
derers. I answered, I was heartily afraid of it when I left them
there; and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island,
but that they were not come back, that I might have put them
in possession of every thing first, and left the other in a state of
subjection, as they deserved: but if they had reduced them to it,
I was very glad, and should be very far from finding any fault
with it; for I knew they were a parcel of refractory ungovemed
villains, and were fit for any manner of mischief.

While I was saying this, came the man whom he had sent
back, and with him eleven men more: in the dress they were in,
it was impossible to guess what nation they were of; but he
made all clear both to them and to me. First, he turned to me,
and pointing to them, said, These, Sir, are some of the gentle-
men who owe their lives to you; and then turning to them, and
pointing to me, he let them know who I was; upon which they
all came up one by one, not as if they had been sailors, and ordi-
nary fellows, and I the like, but really as if they had been am-
bassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch, or a great conqueror:
their behaviour was to the last degree obliging and courteous,
and yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity, which very well
became them; and in short, they had so much more manners
than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their civilitiea, much
less how to return them in kind.

The history of their coming to, and conduct in the island, after
my going away, is so very remarkable, and has so many inci-
dents, which the former part of my relation will help to under-
stand, and which will, in most of the particulars, refer to that
account I have already given, that I cannot but commit them
with great delight to the reading of those that come after me.

I shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first
person, which will put me to the expense of ten thousand said I':,
and :aid he':, and he told me':, and I told him':, and the like;
but I shall collect the facts historically, as near as I can gather
them out of my memory, from what they related to me, and
from what I met with in my conversing with them, and with the
place.

I order to do this succinctly, and as intelligibly as I can, I
must go back to the circumstance in which I left the island, and
which the persons were, of whom I am to speak. And first, it
is necessary to repeat, that I had sent away Friday's father and
the Spaniard, the two whose lives I had rescued from the savages;
I say, I hadsent them awayin a largeeanoetothemain,a:1
the): thaught it, to fetch over the Spaniard: companions, whom
he had left behind him, in order to save them from the like
calamity that he had been in, and in order to succour them for
the present, and that, if possible, we might together find some
way for our deliverance afterward.

When I sent them away, I had no visible appearance of, or
the lent room to hope for, my own deliverance, any more than
I had twenty year before; much less had I any foreknowledge
of what afterward happened, I mean of an English ship coming
on shore there to fetch me off; and it could not but be a very
greatsurprise to them, whentheycame back, notonlycofind
that I was gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot,
possessed of all that I had left behind me, which would otherwise
have been their own.

The first thing, however, which I enquired into (that I might
begin where I left off), was of their own part: and I desired he
would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his
countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over.
He told me there was little variety in that part; for nothing
remarkable happened to them on the way, they having very calm
weather, and a smooth sea: for his countrymen, it could not be
doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems
he was the principal man among them, the captain of the vessel
they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time):
they were, he mid, the more surprised to see him, because they
knew that he was fallen into the hands of savages, who, they
were satisfied, would devour him as they did all the rest of their
prisoners: that when he told them the story of the deliverance,
and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them away, it
was like a dream to them; and their astonishment, they said,
was something like that of joseplx': brethren, when he told them
who he was, and told them the story of his exaltation in Pharaoh's
court: but when he shewed them the arms, the powder, the ball,
and the provisions that he brought them for their journey, or
voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a just share of
the joy of their deliverance, and immediately prepared to come
away with him.

Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they-were
obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part of it, but to
trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two large
canoes or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for
pleasure.

In these they came away the next morning; it seems they
.wanted no time to get themselves ready, for they had no bag-
gage, neither clothes, or provisions, or any thing in the world,
but what they had on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they
used to make their bread.

They were in all three weeks absent, and in that time, un-
luckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I
mentioned in my other part, and to get ofl' from the island;
leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungoverncd, dis-
agreeable villains behind me, that any man could desire to meet
with, to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappointment, you
may be sure.

The onlyjust thing the rogues did, was, that when the Spaniard:
caine on shore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them
provisions, and other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also
they gave them the long paper of directions, which I had left
with them, containing the particular methods which I took for
managing every part of my life there; the way howl baked my
bread, bred up tame goats, and planted my corn; how I cured
my grapes, made my pots, and, in a word, every thing I did:
all this being written down, they gave to the Spaniards, two of
whom understand English well enough; nor did they refuse to
accommodate the Spaniard: with every thing else, for they agreed
very well for some time: they gave them an equal admission
into the house, or cave, and they began to live very sociably;
and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my method,
and Friday': father together, managed all their affairs: for, as
for the Englishmen they did nothing but ramble about the island,
shoot parrots, and catch tortoises, and when they came home at
night, the Spaniard: provided their suppers for them.

The Spaniard: would have been satisfied with this, would the
other but have let them alone; which, hoWever, they could not
find in their hearts to do long; but, like the dog in the manger,
they would not eat themselves, and would not let others eat
neither: the differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial,

Q .
and such as are not worth relating; but at last it broke out into
open war, and it begun with all the rudeness and insolence that
can be imagined, without reason, without provocation, contrary
to nature, and indeed to common sense; and though it is true,
the first relation of it came from the Spaniardr themselves,
whom I may call the accusers, yet when I came to examine the
fellows, they could not deny a word of it.

But before I come to the particular of this part, I must supply
a defect in my former relation; and this was, that I forgot to set
down among the rest, that, just as we were weighing the anchor
to 'set sail, there happened a little quarrel on board our ship,
which I was afraid once would have turned to a second mutiny;
nor was it appeased till the captain, musing up his courage, and
taking us all to his assistance, parted them by force, and making
two of the most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in
irons; and as they had been active in the former disorders, and
let fall some ugly dangerous words the second time, he threatened
to wry them in irons to England, and have them hanged there
for mutiny and running away with the ship.

This, it seems, though the aptain did not intend to do it, frighted
some other men in the ship; and some of them had put it into
the heads of the rest, that the captain only gave them good wards
for the present, till they should come to some Englirli port; and
that then they should be all put into gaol, and tried for their
lives.

The mate got intelligence of this, and acquainted us with it;
upon which it was desired, that I, who still passed for a great
man among them, should go dowri. with the mate, and satisfy the
men, and tell them, that they might be assured, if they behaved
well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time past
should be pardoned. So I went, and after passing ill] hmout':
word to them, they appeared easy, and the more so, when I
caused the two men who were in irons, to be released and for-
given.z

But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night,
the wind also falling ealm; next morning we found, that our two
men who had been laid in irons, had stole each of them a mus-
quet, and some other weapons ; what powder or shot they had,
we know not; and had taken the ship's pinnace, which was not
yet haled up, and ran away with her to their companions in
roguery on the shore.

As soon as we found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore,
with twelve men and the mate, and away they went to seek the
rogues; but they could neither find them, nor any of the rest;
for they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming
on shore. The mate was once resolved, in justice to their
roguery, to have destroyed their plantations, burnt all their house-
hold-stuff and furniture, and left them to shift without it; but
having no order, he let it all alone, left every thing as they
found it, and bringing the pinnace away, came on board without
them.

These two men made their number five; but the other three
villains were so much wickeder than these, that after they had
been two or three days together, they turned their two new--
comers out of doors to shift for themselves, and would have no-
thing to do with them; nor could they for a good while be per-
suaded to give them any food: as for the Spaniards, they were
not yet come.

When the Spaniard: came first on shore, the business began
to go forward; the Spaniard: would have persuaded the three
English brute: to have taken in their two countrymen again, that,
as they said, they might be all one family; but they would not
hear of it: so the two poor fellows lived by themselves; and
finding nothing but industry and application would make them
live comfortably, they pitched their tents on the north shore of
the island, but a. little more to the west, to be out of the danger
of the savages, who always landed on the car! parts of the island.
Here they built them two huts, one to lodge in, and the other
to lay up their magazines and stores in; and the Spaniard:
having given them some corn for seed, and especially some of
the peas which I had left them, they dug and planted, and en-
closed after the pattern I had set for them all, and began to live
pretty well. Their first crop of com was on the ground, and
though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at
first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve
them, and find them with bread or other eatables; and one of
the fellows, being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at
making soup, puddings, and such other preparations, as the rice
and the milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to
do.

They were going on in this little thriving posture, when the
three unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere
humour, and to insult them, came and bullied them, and told
them the island was theirs; that the governor, meaning me, had
given them possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it;
and, damn them, they should build no houses upon their ground,
unless they would pay them rent for them.

The two men thought they had jested at first; asked them to
come and sit down, and see what fine houses they were that they
had built, and tell them what rent they demanded: and one of
them merrily told them, if they were ground-landlords, he hoped
if they built tenements upon the land, and made improvements,
they would, according to the custom of all landlords, grant them
a long lease; and bid them go fetch a scrivener to draw the
writings. One of the three damning and raging, told them,
they should see they were not in jest; and going to a little place
at a distance, where the honest men had made a fire to dress their
victuals, he takes a fire-brand and claps it to the outside of their
hut, and very fairly set it on fire; and it would have been all
burnt down in a few minutes, if one of the two had not run to
, the fellow, thrust him away, and trod the tire out with his feet,
and that not without some difficulty too.

The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting
him away, that he returned upon him with a pole he had in his
hand; and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and
run into the hut, he had ended his days at once. His comrade,
seeing the danger they were both in, ran in after him, and imme
diately they came both out with their musquets; and the man
that was first struck at with the pole, knocked the fellow down,
that had begun the quarrel, with the stock of his musquet, and
that before the other two could come to help him; and then see-
ing the rest come at them, they stood together, and presenting
the other ends of their pieces to them, bade them stand of.

The other had fire-arms with them too: but one of the two
honest men bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his
danger, told them, if they ofibred to move hand or foot, they
were dead men; and boldly commanded them to lay down their
arms. They did not indeed lay down their arms; but, seeing
him so resolute, it brought them to a parley, and they consented
to take their wounded man with them, and be gone; and in-
deed, it seems the fellow was wounded sufliciently with the
blow; however, they were much in the wrong, since they had
the advantage, that they did not disarm them effectually, as they
might have done, and have gone immediately to the Spaniards,
and given them an account how the rogues had treated them;
for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every day
gave them some intimation that they did so.

But not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part
of their rogueries, such as heading down their corn, shooting
three young kids, and a she-goat which the poor men had got to
breed up tame for their store; and, in a word, plaguing them
night and day in this manner, it forced the two men to such a
desperation, that they resolved to fight them all three the first
time they had a fair opportunity. In order to this, they resolved
to go to the castle, as they culled it, that was my old dwelling,
where the three rogues and the Spaniard: all lived together at that
time, intending to have a fair battle, and the Spaniard: should
stand by to see fair play. So they got up in the morning before
day, and came to the place, and called the Englishmen by their
names, telling a Spaniard that answered, that they wanted to
speak with them.

It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards; having
been in the woods, had seen one of the two Englirhlnen, whom,
for distinction, I call the honest men; and he had made a sad
complaint to the Spaniard:, of the barbarous usage they had met
with from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined their
plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so
hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat, and their three
kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance; and
that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not mist
them again, they should be starved. When the Spaniard: came
home at night, and they were all at supper, he took the freedom
to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle and man-
nerly terms, and asked them, how they could be so cruel, they
being harmless inoffensive fellows, and that they were only put-
ting themselves in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it
had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such perfec-
tion as they had?

One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, What had
they to do there? That they came on shore without leave,
and that they should not plant or build upon the island; it was
none of their ground. Why, says the Spaniard, very calmly,
Seignior Inglese, they mart not starve. The Englirhnaan replied,
like a true rough-hewn tarpaulin, they might starve and be
damned, they should not plant or build. But what must they
do then, Seignior? says the Spaniard. Another of, the brute:
returned, Do! d-'-n them, they should be servants, and "work
for them. But how can you expect that of them? says the
Spaniard, they are not bought with your money; you have no
right to make them servants. The Englishman answered, the
island was theirs, the governor had given it to them, and no man
had any thing to do there but themselves; and with that swore
by his Maker, that they would go and burn all their new huts;
they should build none upon their land.

Why, Seignior, says the Spaniard, by the same rule, we must
be your servants too. Ay, says the bold dog, and so you shall
too, before we have done with you, mixing two or three G---d
d--n-me's in the proper intervals of his speech. The Spaniard
only smiled at that, and made him no answer. However, this
little discourse had heated them; and starting up, one says to
the other, I think it was he they called W711 Atkim, Come, Tack,
let us go and have the other brush with them; we will demo-
lish their eastle, I will warrant you; they shall plant no colony
in our dominions.

Upon this they went all trooping away, with every man a
gun, a pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things
among themselves, of what they would do to the Spaniard: too,
when opportunity offered ; but the Spaniard:, it seems, did not
so perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars;
only that, in general, they threatened them hard for taking the
two Englishman's part.

Whither they went, or how they bestowed their time that
evening, the Spaniard: said they did not know; but it seems
they wandered about the country part of the night; and then
lying down in the place which I used to all my bower, they
were weary, and overslept themselves. The case was this: they
had resolved to stay till midnight, and so to take the two poor
men when they were asleep; and as they acknowledged after-
wards, intended to set fire to their huts while they were in them,
and either burn them in them, or murder them as they came
out: and, as malice seldom sleeps very sound, it was very strange
they should not have been kept waking.

However, as the two men had also a design upon them, as I
have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and
murdering, it happened, and very luckily, for them all, that they
were up and gone abroad, before the bloody--minded rogues came
to their huts.

When they came there and found the men gone, Atkins, who
it seems was the forwardest man, called out to his comrades,
Ha! 74:15 here's the nest; but d--n them, the birds are flown:
they mused awhile to think what should be the occasion of their
being gone abroad so soon, and suggested presently, that the
Spaniard: had given them notice of it; and with that they shook
hands, and swore to one another, that they would be revenged
of the Spaniards. As soon as they had made this bloody bar~
gain, they fell to work with the poor men's habitation; they did
not set fire indeed to any thing, but they pulled down both their
little houses, and pulled them so limb from limb that they left not
the least stick standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where
they stood ; they tore all their little collected household--strut? in
pieces, and threw every thing about in such a manner, that the
poor men afterwards found some of their things a mile off of
their habitation.

When they had done this, they pulled up all the young trees
the poor men had planted; pulled up an enclosure they had
made to secure their cattle and their com; and, in a word,
sacked and plundered every thing as completely as a herd of
Tartar: would have done.

The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out,
and had resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though
they were but two to three : so that, had they met, there certainly
would have been bloodshed among them; for they were all very
stout resolute fellows, to give them their due.
But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than
they themselves could do to meet: for as they had dogged one
another, when the three were gone thither, the two were here;
and afterwards, when the two went back to find them, the three
were some to the old habitation again; we shall see their difi'er-
ing conduct presently. When the three came back, like furi--
ous creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they had
been about. put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and
told them what they had done, by way of seal? and bravado;
and one of them stepping up to one of the Spaniardr, as if they
had been a couple of boys at play, takes hold of his hat, as it
was upon his head, and giving it a twirl about, fleeting in his
face, says he to him, Andyou, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have
the ram sauce, tfyou do not mendyour manners. The Spaniard,
who, though a quiet civil man, was as brave as a man could de-
sire to be, and withal a strong well-made man, looked steadily at
him for a good while; and then, having no weapon in his hand,
stept gravely up to him, and with one blow of his fist, knocked
him down, as an ox is felled with a pole axe, at which one of
the rogues, insolent as the first, fired his pistol at the Spaniard
immediately: he missed his body indeed, for the bullets went
through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of his ear, and
he bled pretty much. The blood made the Spaniard believe he
was more hurt than he really was, and that put him into some
heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm; but now resolv-
ing to go through with his work, he stooped and took the fel--
low's musquet whom he had knocked down, and wasjust going
to shoot the manwho had fired at him; when therestofthe
Spaniards, being in the cave, came out, and calling to him not
to shoot, they stept in, secured the other two, and took their
arms from them.

When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all
the Spaniard: their enemies, as well as their own countrymen,

o~2
they began to cool; and giving the Spaniard: better words,
would have had their arms again; but the Spaniard: considering
the feud that was between them and the other two Englishmen,
and that it would be the best method they could take to keep
them from killing one another, told them they would do them
no harm ; and if they would live peaceably they would be very
willing to assist and associate with them, as they did before; but
that they could not think of giving them their arms again, while
they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own
countrymen, and had even threatened them all to make them

their servants.

The rogues were now more capable to hear reason than to act
reason: but being refused their arms, they went raving away,
and raging like madmen, threatening what they would do,
though they had no fire-arms: but the Spaniardx, despising their
threatening, told them they should take care how they ofi'ered
any injury to their plantation or cattle; for if they did, they
would shoot them, as they would do ravenous beasts, wherever
they found them; and if they fell into their hands alive, they
should certainly be hanged. However, this was far from cool-
ing them; but away they went, raging and swearing like furies
of hell. As soon as they were gone, came back the two men in
passion and rage enough also, though of another kind; for,
having been at their plantation, and finding it all demolished and
destroyed, as above, it will easily be supposed they had provoca-
tion enough; they could scarce have room to tell their tale, the
Spaniard: were so eager to tell them theirs; and it was strange
enough to find, that three men thus bully nineteen, and receive
no punishment at all.

The Spaniard: indeed despised them, and especially having
thus disarmed them, made light of all their threatenings , but the
two Englishmen resolved to have their remedy against them, what
pains soever it cost to find them out.
But the Spaniard: interposed here too, and told them, that as
they had disarmed them: they could not consent that they (the
two) should pursue them with fire-arms; and perhaps kill them:
but, said the grave Spaniard, who was their governor, we will
endeavour to make them' do you justice, if you will leave it to
us, for, as there is no doubt but they will come to us again when'
their passion is over, being not able to subsist without our as-'
sistance, we promise you to make no peace with them, without
having a full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition we
hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than
in your defence.

The two Englishmen yielded to this very awkwardly, and
with great reluctance; but the Spaniard: protested, they did it
only to keep them from bloodshed, and to make all easy at last,
for, said they, we are not so many of us; here is room enough
for us all, and it is great pity we should not be all good friends.
At length they did consent, and waited for the issue of the thing,
living for some days with the Spaniards; for their own habita-
tion was destroyed.

In about five days time the three vagrants, tired with wander-
ing, and almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on
turtles eggs all that while, me back to the grove; and finding
my Spaniard, who, as I have said, was the governor, and two
more with him, walking by the side of the creek, they came up
in a very submissive humble manner, and begged to be received
again into the family. The Spaniard: used them civilly, but
told them, they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen,
and so very grossly by them (the Spaniards), that they could
not come to any conclusion without consulting the two Englirlx~
men, and the rest; but however they would go to them, and
discourse about it, and they should know in half an hour. It
may be guessed that they were very hard put to it; for it seems,
as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they begged
he would send them out some breed in the mean time; which he
did, and sent them at the same time a large piece of goat's flesh,
and a boiled parrot; which they eat very heartily, for they were
hungry enough.

After half an hour's consultation they were called in, and a
long debate had among them, their two countrymen charging
them with the ruin of all their labour, and a design to murder
them ; all which they owned before, and therefore could not deny
now ; upon the whole, the Spaniard acted the moderator between
them; and as they had obliged the two Englirlmm not to hurt
the three, while they were naked and unarmed, so they now ob-
liged the three to go and build their fellows two huts, one to be
of the same, and the other of larger dimensions than they were
before; to fence their ground again, where they had pulled up
the fences, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up
the land again for planting corn, where they had spoiled it; and,
in a word to restore every thing in the earne state as they found
it, as near as they could; for entirely it could not be, the season
for com, and the growth of the trees and hedges, not being possi-
ble to be recovered.

Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of
provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and
the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together;
only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to work;
I mean, for themselves, except now and then a little, just as they
pleased; however, the Spaniard: told them plainly, that if they
would but live sociably and friendly together, and study in the
whole the good of the plantation, they would be content to work
for them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleas-
ed; and thus having lived pretty well together for a month or
two, the Spaniard: gave them their arms again, and gave them
liberty to go abroad with them as before.

It was notabove a week after they had these arms, and went
abroad, buttheungratefirlcreamresbegantobeas insolent and
troubluome as before: but, however, an accident happened pre-
sently upon this, which endangered the safety of them all; they
were obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look to the
preservation of their lives.

It happened one night, that the Spasiard governor, as I eall
him, that is to say, the Spaniard whose life I had saved, who
was now the captain, or leader, or governor of the rest, found
himself very uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any
sleep: he was perfectly well -in body, as he told me the story,
only found his thoughts tumultuous; his mind ran upon men
fighting and killing of one another, but was broad awake, and
could not by any means get any sleep; in short, he lay a great
while; but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to rise:
as they lay, being so many of them, upon goat-skins, laid thick
upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves, not in
hammocks and ship beds, as I did, who was but one, so they had
little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get up upon
their feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their
pumps, and they were ready for going any way that their
thoughts guided them.

Being thus gotten up, he looked out; but, being dark, he
could see little or nothing; and besides, the trees which I had
planted, as in my former account is described, and which were
now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he could only look
up, and see that it was a clear star-light night; and, hearing no
noise, he returned and laid him down again; but it was all one,
he could not sleep, nor could he compose himself to any thing
like rest, but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and
yet he knew not for what.

Having made some noise with rising and walking about,
going out and coming in, another of them waked, and, calling,
asked who it was that was up? The governor told him, how it
had been with him. Say you so, says the other Spaniard; such
things are not to be slighted, I assure you; there is certainly
some mischief Working, says he, near us; and presently he asked
him, Where are the Englishmen? They are all in their huts,
says he, safe enough. It seems the Spaniard: had kept possession
of the main apartment, and had made a place, where the three
Englishmen, since their last mutiny, always quartered by them-
selves, and could not come at the rest. Well, says the Spaniard,
there is something in it, I am persuaded from my own experi-
rience; I am satisfied our spirits embodied have a converse with,
and receive intelligence from, the spirits unembodied, and inha-
biting the invisible world; and this friendly notice is given for
our advantage, if we know how to make use of it. Come, says
he, let us go out and look abroad; and if we find nothing at
all in it to justify our trouble, I will tell you a story to the
purpose, that shall convince you of the justice of my pro-
posing it.

In a word, they went out to go up to the top of the hill,
where I used to go; but they, being strong, and in good com-
pany, not alone, as I was, used none of my cautions to go up by
the ladder, and then pulling it up after them, to go up a second
stage to the top, but were going round through the grove uncon-
cerned and unwary, when they were surprised with seeing a light
as of fire, a very little way of? from them, and hearing the voices
of men, not of one or two, but of a great number.

In all the discoveries I had made of the savages landing on
the island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the
least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place;
and when by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so
effectually, that they that got away were scarce able to give any
account of it, for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor did ever
any that had seen me escape to tell any one else, except it was
the three savages in our last encounter, who jumped into the boat,
of whom I mentioned that I was afraid they should go home, and
bring more help.

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of those men,
that so great a number came now together; or whether they
eame ignorantly, and by accident, on their usual bloody errand,
they could not it seems understand; but whatever it was, it had
been their business, either to have concealed themselves, and not
have seen them at all; much less to have let the savages have
seen that there were any inhabitants in the place; or to have
fallen upon them so effectually, as that not a man of them should
have escaped, which could only have been by getting in between
them and their boats; but this presence of mind was wanting to
them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great while.

We need not doubt but that the governor, and the man with
him, surprised with this sight, run back immediately, and raised
their fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger
they were all in; and they again as readily took the alarm, but
it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where

they were, but that they must run all out to see how things
stood

While it was dark indeed, they were well enough, and they
had opportunity enough, for some hours, to view them by the
light of three fires they had made at some distance from one
another; what they were doing they knew not, and what to do
themselves they knew not; for, first, the enemy were too many;
and, secondly, they did not keep together, but were divided into
several parties, and were on shore in several places.

The Spaniard: were in no small consternation at this sight;
and as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the
shore, they made no doubt, but, first or last, some of them would
chop in upon their habitation, or upon some other place, where
they would we the token of inhabitants; and they were in great
perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats, which would have
been little less than starving them, if they should have been
destroyed; so the first thing they resolved upon was to dispatch
three men away before it was light, viz. two Spaniard: and one
Englirlzman, to driVe all the goats away to the great valley
where the cave was, and, if need were, to drive them into the
very cave itself.

Could they have seen the savages altogether in one body, and
at any distance from their canoes, they resolved, if they had been
a hundred of them, to have attacked them; but that could not
be obtained, for they'were some of them two miles off from the
other, and, as it appeared afterwards, were of two difi'erent nations.

After having mused a great while on the course they should
take, and beaten their brains in considering their present circum-
stances, they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send the
old savage (Friday's father) out as a spy, to learn, if possible,
something concerning them, what they came for, and what they
intended to do; the old man readily undertook it, and, stripping
himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, away he went':
after he had been gone an hour or two, he brings word, that he
had been among them undiscovered, that he found they were two
parties, and of two several nations, who had war with one another,
and had had a great battle in their own country, and that both
sides, having had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were
by mere chance landed all in the same island for the devouring
their prisoners, and making merry; but their coming so by
chance to the same place, had spoiled all their mirth; that they
were in a great rage at one another; and that they were so near,
that he believed they would fight again as soon as day-light
began to appear; but he did not perceive that they had any
notion of any body's being on the island but themselves. He
had hardly made an end of telling his story, when they could
perceive, by the unusual noise they made, that the two little
armies were engaged in a bloody fight.
