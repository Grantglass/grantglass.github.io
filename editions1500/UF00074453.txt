ROBINSON CRUSOE.

ROBINSON CRUSOE had a desire to go to sea from the I

time that he was quite a boy, but his parents did not wish
it, so the first opportunity he sailed away without saying any-
thing to anybody, never thinking of the sorrow his kind Father
and Mother would feel when he was not to be found. After a
great many adventures, when he had been away a long time,
he was wrecked on the Island of Juan Fernandez. The ship
was driven on the rocks in a storm, and every one on board
was drowned except Robinson himself, who was washed ashore
by the waves just as night was coming on. In the morning he
made a raft of pieces of wood and went to the ship a good

many times, and collscted all manner of things, not-forgetting

   
 
 

guns, pistols, powder,
and tools of all kinds.

the 'island, he found some turtles, so he carried one home and
cooked it. This was a great treat to him after having eaten
only goat's flesh for so long. He next eut'clown some trees
and made a fence with their trunks and branches all around his
hut. Then he caught some goats when they were quite young,
and tamed them, this he did by digging a pit into 'which they
fell without being hurt, and then carrying them home to his

enclosure where they soon became quite tame. He also man--m

and teach
it to talk.
One 'day
he began
building a
boat by
means of
which he
hoped to

 

visit other islands. He was on his way to work at this boat one
morning when he saw the print of a naked foot on the sand. He
was so much frightened that he ran back to his hut. Nothing
I hon/ever, came of it for no one appeared to whom the foot
could belong. So after-a time Robinson ventured out again,
though he did not feel as safe as he had done before, and
always kept a sharp look out about him. This continued for
about two years, and then one day he saw a number of savages
on the beach, where there was a fire, and as there were several

canoes drawn up close'by', he supposed, as he afterwards knewto be the case, that they had come from another island, and his

I horror was much increased when he saw them actually kill one
'of two men who lay bound on the ground, and eat his body

. after cooking it at the fire \Vhile they did this, the other pris-

oner, a black boy, escaped and ran in the direction of the place '

where Robinson was hiding. - Some of the savages followed

him. but Robinson shot them, and the noise so terrified the

rest that they leapt into their canoes and paddled away. Rob-

inson gave the lad whom

 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  

he>> had saved the name of I
Friday, because it was on
a Friday that he .came.
He soon became an affec-
tionate servant to his
master, and the two were
very happy together. Then
they set'about building

a large boat in which

to make a voyage.

calm weather in which to start, some canoes full of savages
again visited the island, having with them a prisoner whom
they were going to kill and eat. Robinson and Friday attacked
them with the guns, and having killed a great number, beat the
remainder into the sea. A few were able to get into their
canoes and paddle away, but they were obliged to leave behind .
one canoe containing the prisoner, and him, Friday, to his great
joy, recognized as his Father. The poor man was very weak, '
and before he had recovered his strength, a ship appeared in
sight, and Robinson and Friday loading their possessions on
a raft, went out towards it, and the unfortunate Robinson had

at last the pleasure of once more

 
 
 

hearing an English
voice. He
and Friday

sailed away

and landed
in S p a i n,

and then,adventures on their journey, made their way
home to England. Robinson found, to his.
great sor-
row, that his.
Father and
Mother were
both dead
and he could
not now, as
he wished,
tell them of.
his grief and
repentance
for having
disobeyed them. By--and-by he married, and after a time went
on a voyage to visit the island where they had left some English
sailors and Friday's Father. It had become quite a Colony,
and poor Friday rejoiced to see his Father once more. He,
himself, poor fellow, was killed on the way home again, to
the great distress of his master. Robinson Crusoe at last settled
down in England, and tried_to do as much good as possible
to show-he was truly repentant for the foolish and disobedient
conduct of his youth, and he would often take his children

on his knee and tell them of his wonderful adventures.
