ROBINSON CRUSOE AND FRIDAY.

 

l WHO'S that funny man? you say,
I Talking, there, on a summer day ;' I
And Who 's the black, With face so meek,
Who's sitting there to hear him speak ?

 

They're Friday and Robinson Crusoe, -- I
I thought that perhaps you knew so; i

They dwell on an island all alone. .
And pray 110W came they to do so ? ]

I-DE.' WANTS TO GO TO SEA ,
Foolish Robinson Crusoe.

Said his father, "Stay With me;
You'd much better do so."

But he went, in spite of all, ----

 

Every precept scorning;
Soon a mishap did befall,
That turned his joy to mourning.

THERE COIVIES A GREAT STORM.

 

While the ship was sailing fast,
Storm-clouds did enshroud her;

Loud and angry blew the blast, --
Louder still, and louder!

Till the ship at last was thrown
On a rocky island; '

Then poor Crusoe, all alone,
Swam and reached the dry land.

3HE SLEEPS IN A TREE.

Wet and hungry, all alone,
Now stood poor young Crusoe;
Chilled and sore in every bone,
By the Wind that blew so.

As he up a tree did creep,

Higher still, and higher,
Said he, "In this tree I'd sleep,
If I were but drier."HE MAKES A RAFT.

 

When at morning 'he awoke,
There the ship was lying.

" Can I save some things?" he thought;
"There's no harm in trying."

So, you see, a raft he's made
With some boards he's taken;

And has food to land conveyed, --
Biscuit, beef, and bacon.Soon a tent he doth complete;
Why should he have done so?

'T was to guard him from the heat
Of the sun that shone so.

But'he had a cave as well, -,-
I need scarcely mention,
Always thus in tents to dwell

Was not his intention.HE MAKES HIMSELF CLOTHES.

 

Soon our friend wore out his clothes,
He'd to climb and crawl so;

Holes appeared in coat'and hose,--
In his trousers also.

i
F

In his cave he's sitting down, l
By the lamplight yellOW, ' '
Making coats of goatskins brown.
What a clever fellow!

HE IS FRIGHTENEi).

 

Now, With clothes, and food, and home,
All his cares are lightened;

Why, then, as he here doth come,
Does he look so frightened?

Footstep prints are in the sand,
And by what he's seen there,
Crusoe knows that in the land

Savage men have been there.

Crusoe saw that something smoked
On the shore, soon after;
K Through his spy-glass at it looked; I

He'd no cause for laughter.

Fifty sauage men, or more, --
Quite a numerous meeting, --

Sat there, feasting, on the shore;

Prisoners they were eating."7*... . .-

HE SAVES THE POOR PRISONER.

 

One poor prisoner tried to flee,
(You, too, would have done so ;)

Through the wood away ran he;
Never man did run so.

After him two men did go,
But, to ambush hying,
Crusoe fired his gnu, and, 10!

Dead those men are lying.
10HE} GIVEe THE CgPTlVE bCLOTHEC;
Thus he saved the captive's life,
Counting it a high day,

When he rescued from the strife
His good servant Friday.

To his chest he goes,

Full of useful treasure,
It Soon looks out some clothes
Just of Friday's measure: '

Here is Friday much afraid;
On the ground he's lying;
For a trick his master played,--
His courage he'd be trying.

He had seen no gun before,

And he thought --no wonder --
That the flash was lightning,

And the noise was thunder.4

; Friday was a handy man, --
I Learned his lessons gaily;

Built a boat, and carved a pan,
And turned the roast meat daily.Friday came, one day, apace,
To his master, Crusoe;

There stood written in his face
Good news, and he knew so.

For a gallant ship there lay,
Rode at anchor nigh land,

'That could take them quite away

From the desert island.

14Here, at last, is Robinson
Crusoe home returning;

Weeps With joy to think he's done
With solitude and mourning.Now in England he can dwell, --
Fears no more commotion, --

Winds that blow, or storms that swell
On the mighty ocean. '

Obey your parents, Children dear,
Don't neglect to do so;

Or you 'll suffer too, I fear,
As did Robinson Crusoe.
