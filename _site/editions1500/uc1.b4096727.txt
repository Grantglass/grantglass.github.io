PREFACE TO FIFTH EDITION
The main object of this preface is to thank those who have
so kindly assisted me in the production of the book. At the
same time, it may be pointed out that the reasons for the
adoption of the Basle nomenclature were fully stated in vol. i.,
and that the alterations which have been made in the plans
of dissection in vol. ii. are not less numerous than those made
in vol. i. The alterations include changes in the method of
dissecting the face, the posterior triangle, and the deeper
parts of the neck. Two plans of dissection to display the
middle ear and its surroundings are described. They can be
carried out on opposite sides of the head, and the steps of
the second method are those followed by the surgeon operat-
ing for the relief of mastoid and middle ear disease. The
dissection of the thorax has been very largely re-arranged
with the object of giving the dissector an opportunity of
studying the relative positions of the organs in the medi-
astinum whilst they are practically undisturbed.
The various plans of dissection described were decided
X. upon, after many trials, as those best adapted to give the
student a clear idea of the relative positions of important
structures; and I am greatly indebted to my first and second
assistants, Dr. E. B. Jamieson and Mr. T. B. Johnston, and
^ to Professor R. B. Thomson of Cape Town, for the trouble
Lb they have taken and the help they have given in devising,
modifying, and testing new plans of work.
I am indebted also to Dr. Jamieson for dissections of the
brain and heart; to Mr. Johnston for the dissections of the
parotid gland; to Mr. W. W. Carlow for a dissection of the
mediastinum; and to M^ssg, Basseghian, R. C. Rogers,
vi
PREFACE TO FIFTH EDITION
and F. M. Halley for other dissections upon which they
have expended time and skill, and which have been used
in the preparation of the new illustrations.
I wish also to thank Professor Arthur Thomson for per-
mission to use the illustrations of his beautiful dissections of
the eye; Professor A. M. Patersori for permission to use two
diagrams illustrating the connections of some of the cranial
nerves; and Dr. Logan Turner for the loan of the specimens
from which the illustrations of the dissection of the mastoid
region and middle ear were made.
All the new illustrations are from drawings made by Mr.
J. T. Murray. They are characteristic of his excellent work,
and I am indebted to him for the care and skill he has ex-
pended on their production.
The new indices and the glossary are the work of Mr. J.
Keogh Murphy, F.R.C.S. I believe they will prove to be of
great service; and I desire to thank him not only for the
time and trouble he has spent upon them, but also for many
useful suggestions which he has made during the progress of
the work.

OF
PRACTICAL ANATOMY.
HE dissection of the thorax is commenced on the thirteenth
day1 after the subject has been placed in the dissecting-
room. By that time the upper limbs have been detached
from the trunk.
In form, the thorax resembles a truncated cone. Anteriorly
and posteriorly it is flattened; laterally it is full and rounded.
During life the movements of the thoracic walls produce
alterations in the capacity of the chest cavity, and play an
essential part in the function of respiration; these movements
the student should study upon himself and his friends.
The thoracic cavity is bounded anteriorly by the sternum
and costal cartilages; it is bounded posteriorly by the twelve
thoracic vertebrae and the intervening fibro-cartilages, together
with the portions of the ribs which extend laterally from the
vertebral column as far as the angles; the lateral boundaries
are formed by the bodies of the ribs, from their angles
posteriorly to their anterior extremities anteriorly. These
parts constitute the framework of the thorax, and can be
studied on the skeleton as well as upon the part before
the dissection is commenced.
The anterior wall of the thorax is shorter than the posterior
wall and, during expiration, the upper margin of the sternum
THORAX.

1 Saturdays and Sundays are not counted.
VOL. II—1
THORAX
lies opposite the fibro-cartilage between the second and third
thoracic vertebrae, whilst the lower end of the body of the
sternum corresponds in level with the middle of the body of the
ninth thoracic vertebra. The bodies of the thoracic vertebrae
project anteriorly into the cavity of the thorax, and greatly
diminish its antero-posterior diameter in the median plane;
but the backward sweep of the posterior portions of the ribs
produces a deep hollow on either side of the vertebral column,
for the reception of the most massive part of the lung.
The superior aperture, inlet of the thorax, is a narrow
opening which is bounded by the first thoracic vertebra, the

first pair of costal arches, and the manubrium sterni. The
plane of this opening is very oblique; it slopes from the first
thoracic vertebra anteriorly and downwards. Through the
inlet of the thorax the apices of the lungs project upwards
into the root of the neck, and, between them, the follow-
ing structures pass through it:—the windpipe, the gullet, the
vagi, the phrenic nerves, the left recurrent nerve, the ganglion-
ated sympathetic trunks, the thoracic duct, and the great
arteries and veins which carry blood to and from the head
and neck and the upper limbs.
The base or inferior end of the thorax is very wide,
and is sometimes called the outlet. Anteriorly it is bounded
by the xiphoid process, and posteriorly by the twelfth thoracic
vertebra. Between these points the lower margin of the
thorax presents a curved outline. Starting from the sternum,
it passes downwards, laterally, and posteriorly, as far as the
tip of the eleventh costal cartilage; thence it proceeds up-
THORACIC WALL
3
wards, posteriorly, and medially to the vertebral column. In
the first part of its extent it is formed by the cartilages of the
seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh ribs, and in the
second part by the lower border of the twelfth rib.
The lower margin of the thorax gives attachment to the
diaphragm, a highly vaulted or dome-shaped musculo-tendinous
partition, which intervenes between the cavity of the thorax
above and that of the abdomen below. It forms a convex
floor for the thorax, and a concave roof for the abdomen.
By its upward projection it greatly diminishes the general
vertical depth of the thoracic cavity.
But the diaphragm does not form an unbroken partition.
It presents three large openings, by means of which structures
pass to and from the thorax, viz.—(1) for the aorta, thoracic
duct, and vena azygos; (2) for the oesophagus and vagi
nerves; (3) for the inferior vena cava. Besides these there
are other smaller apertures which will be mentioned later.
Tivo days at least should be devoted to the dissection of
the thoracic wall.
In addition to the osseous and cartilaginous framework,
the walls of the chest are built up partly by muscles, and
partly by membranes, and in connection with these there are
numerous nerves and blood-vessels.
Dissection.—Portions of certain of the muscles of the upper limb and
of the abdominal wall are still attached to the thoracic wall on each
side. Antero-posteriorly the dissector will meet with the pectoralis major,
the pectoralis minor, and the serratus anterior, whilst towards the lower
margin of the chest he will recognise the rectus abdominis anteriorly,
and the obliquus externus and latissimus dorsi upon its lateral aspect. The
rounded tendon of the subclavius may also be seen taking origin from
the first costal arch. These remnants must be removed so as to lay
bare the costal arches and the intercostal muscles. In detaching the

serratus anterior and external oblique be careful not to injure the lateral
cutaneous nerves which make their appearance in the intervals between
their digitations. The anterior cutaneous nerves and perforating branches of
the internal mammary artery must also be preserved; they pierce the
origin of the pectoralis major in the intervals between the costal cartilages,
close to the margin of the sternum.
Intercostal Muscles and Membranes.—These muscles and
membranes occupy the eleven intercostal spaces on each side.
In each space there are two strata of muscular fibres—a
superficial and a deep. The superficial layer of muscular
fibres is called the external intercostal muscle, and the deep
layer the internal intercostal muscle.
The external intercostal muscles are already exposed, and
very little cleaning is necessary to bring out their connections.
Note that entering into their constitution there is a large
admixture of tendinous fibres, and that these, as well as the
muscular fibres, are directed obliquely downwards and
anteriorly from the lower border of the rib above to the
upper border of the rib below. They do not extend farther
anteriorly, in the various spaces, than the region of union of
the bony with the cartilaginous parts of the costal arches. In
many cases, especially in the upper spaces, they do not
reach so far. When the muscular fibres stop, the tendinous
fibres are prolonged onwards to the sternum in the form
of a membrane, which is called the anterior intercostal mem-
brane. The external intercostal muscles of the two lower
spaces are exceptions to this rule. They extend anteriorly to
the extremities of the spaces. Posteriorly the muscles ex-
tend as far as the tubercles of the ribs, but this is a point
which can be satisfactorily demonstrated only after the thorax
has been opened.
Dissection.—To bring the internal intercostal muscles into view it is
necessary to reflect the external intercostal muscles, and also the anterior
intercostal membranes. Divide them along the lower border of each
space, and throw them upwards. In effecting this dissection, care must be
taken of the intercostal vessels, which lie between the two muscular strata,
and of the lateral branches of the intercostal nerves.
The internal intercostal muscles, thus laid bare, will be seen
to be similar in their constitution to the external muscles.
The fibres, however, run in the opposite direction—viz., from
above, obliquely downwards and posteriorly. Superiorly, each
is attached to the inner surface of the upper rib, immediately
above the costal groove; inferiorly, it is attached upon the
inner surface of the lower rib, close to the upper margin.
The internal intercostal muscles are prolonged anteriorly
to the sternum. Posteriorly they extend to the angles
of the ribs. The posterior intercostal membranes extend from
the spine to posterior borders of the internal intercostals
where they become continuous with the fascial layer between
the external and internal intercostal muscles. They will
be seen when the thorax is opened.
If the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen has not been removed,
the dissector should note that the anterior fibres of the lowest two internal
intercostal muscles become continuous with the fibres of that muscle.

Intercostal Nerves.—The intercostal nerves are altogether
out of sight in the present stage of the dissection. They are
hidden by the lower borders of the ribs which bound the
intercostal spaces superiorly. By gently pulling upon their
lateral cutaneous branches they can be drawn downwards,
and they are then seen to lie between the two muscular strata as
far anteriorly as a point midway between the vertebral column
and sternum. There they sink into the substance of the in-
ternal intercostal muscles, amidst the fibres of which they may
be traced to the anterior extremities of the bony parts
of the ribs, where they reach the deep surface of internal
THORAX
intercostal muscles and are carried medially, first anterior
to the pleura, and then anterior to the transversus thoracis
muscle. Lastly, they cross anterior to the internal mammary
artery and turn anteriorly, at the side of the sternum, as the
anterior cutaneous nerves of the pectoral region. Each nerve,
before it reaches the surface, pierces—(a) the internal inter-
costal muscle; (b) the anterior intercostal membrane; (c)
the origin of the pectoralis major; and (d) the deep fascia
(Fig. 2).
This description holds good for the upper five inter-
costal nerves only. The lower six nerves leave the anterior
ends of the intercostal spaces and run into the abdominal
wall. As they leave the thoracic wall the upper four of the
six pass posterior to the upturned costal cartilages, and all six
pass between the interdigitating slips of the diaphragm and
the transversus abdominis muscles.
The intercostal nerves are the anterior branches of the
upper eleven thoracic nerves. As they traverse the thoracic
wall they give off—(a) the lateral cutaneous branches, (d)
twigs to the intercostal, subcostal, and transversus thoracis
muscles. The terminal extremities of the upper five become
the anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax. (For the
abdominal distribution of the lower six see Vol. I., p. 394.)
The lateral cutaneous branches arise midway between the
vertebral column and the sternum. They pierce the external
intercostal muscles, and pass between the digitations of the
serratus anterior.
The first intercostal nerve does not give a lateral branch,
and it does not become cutaneous anteriorly. The lateral
cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve is the so-
called intercosto-brachial nerve.
It is not necessary to make a dissection of the intercostal nerves in more
than two or three of the spaces.
Intercostal Vessels.—The intercostal arteries should be
dissected in spaces in which the nerves have not been
traced, and in which, therefore, the internal intercostal
muscles are still entire. It is only in a well-injected subject
that a satisfactory view of these vessels can be obtained. In
each intercostal space one artery is found passing dorso-ven-
trally; and in each of the upper nine intercostal spaces, two
anterior intercostal arteries run ventro-dorsally.
7
In the upper two spaces the vessels which run dorso-
ventrally are derived from the superior intercostal division of the
costo-cervical branch of the subclavian artery; in the lower nine
spaces they spring directly from the aorta, and are called the
aortic intercostal arteries.
The anterior intercostal arteries of the upper six spaces
proceed directly from the internal mammary, whilst those of
seventh, eighth, and ninth spaces arise from the musculo-
phrenic artery.
The intercostal vessels are distributed for the most part
between the two muscular strata. From the angles of the
ribs onwards to a point midway between the vertebral column
and sternum, the aortic intercostal arteries lie under shelter of
the lower margins of the ribs which bound the spaces superiorly,
and at a higher level than the corresponding nerves. Then
each divides into two branches, which pass ventrally in
relation to the upper and lower margins of the intercostal
space. They give off small branches which accompany the
lateral cutaneous nerves. The lower two aortic intercostal
arteries are carried onwards into the abdominal wall. The
branches of the superior intercostal artery are disposed in a
manner similar to the aortic intercostal vessels.
The anterior intercostal arteries are two in number for each
space, except the last two. At their origins they lie under
cover of the internal intercostal muscles, and they run later-
ally in relation to the upper and lower margins of the ribs
bounding the spaces. After a short course they pierce the
internal intercostal muscles, and end by anastomosing with
the aortic and superior intercostal arteries.
Dissection.—The dissector should next proceed to remove the intercostal
muscles. This dissection must be done with great care, for immediately
subjacent to the internal intercostals and the ribs is the delicate pleural
membrane which lines the inner surface of the chest wall. The membrane
must not be injured or detached from the deep surfaces of the ribs during
this stage of the dissection. As the internal intercostal muscles are removed,
the anterior perforating branches of the internal mammary and musculo-
phrenic arteries, and the anterior cutaneous nerves must be preserved.
When the muscles are removed the internal mammary artery with its
two accompanying veins will be seen behind the costal cartilages, about
half an inch from the side of the sternum. Clean these arteries in the
intervals between the cartilages and note the small lymph glands
which lie beside them. Each internal mammary artery ends by dividing
into superior epigastric and musculo-phrenic terminal branches in the
interval between the sixth and seventh rib cartilages. Most likely this
space will be so narrow that a view of the bifurcation cannot be obtained.
If this is the case, pare away the edges of the cartilages over the artery, or,

if necessary, remove the medial part of the sixth cartilage completely. The
muscle posterior to the internal mammary artery is the transversus thoracis
(O.T. triangularis sterni). Endeavour to define its slips in the intervals
between the costal cartilages.
The dissector should note, as an important practical point, that towards
the lower margin of the thorax the pleural sac is not prolonged downwards
to the lowest limit of the recess between the diaphragm and the costal
arches. Indeed, in the axillary line, it will be found to fall considerably

short of this. Consequently the dissector will come down directly upon
the diaphragm, when the internal intercostal muscles are removed from
this portion of the chest wall. The fibres of the diaphragm correspond
somewhat in their direction with those of the internal intercostal muscles,
and it is no uncommon occurrence for the student to remove them, and
thus expose the peritoneum, under the impression that he has simply laid
bare the pleura. When the dissection is properly executed a strong fascia
will be seen. It passes from the surface of the diaphragm to the surface
of the costal pleura and holds the latter in position. Preserve this mem-
brane for further examination.
9
Arteria Mammaria Interna.—This vessel arises, in the root
of the neck, from the first part of the subclavian. It enters
the thorax by passing downwards, posterior to the sternal end
of the clavicle and the cartilage of the first rib, and it descends
to the interval between the sixth and seventh costal cartilages,
where it ends by dividing into the superior epigastric and the
musculo-phrenic branches.
Placed anterior to the internal mammary artery are the
upper six costal cartilages, with the intervening internal inter-
costal muscles and anterior intercostal membranes. The inter-
costal nerves cross anterior to it before they turn forwards to
gain the surface. Posterior to the upper part of the artery is
the pleura; and the transversus thoracis intervenes between
the lower part of the artery and the pleural sac.
In addition to its two terminal branches, a large number
of small collateral twigs proceed from the internal mammary—
The anterior intercostal arteries are supplied to the upper six
intercostal intervals, and have been dissected already (p. 6).
Two are given to each space: frequently these arise by a
common trunk.
The perforating arteries accompany the anterior cutaneous
nerves, and reach the surface by piercing the internal inter-
costal muscles, the anterior intercostal membranes, and the
pectoralis major muscle. One, or perhaps two, are given
off in each intercostal space. In the female those of the
second, third, and fourth spaces attain a special importance,
inasmuch as they constitute the principal arteries of supply to
the mammary gland.
The superior epigastric artery passes between the sternal and
costal origins of the diaphragm and enters the sheath of the
rectus muscle of the abdominal wall.
The musculo-phrenic artery turns laterally and downwards,
along the costal origin of the diaphragm and behind the rib-
cartilages. Opposite the eighth costal cartilage it pierces the
diaphragm and terminates on its abdominal surface. It gives
off the anterior intercostal arteries to the seventh, eighth, and
ninth intercostal spaces (p. 7).

THORAX
Musculus Transversus Thoracis (O.T. Triangularis Sterni).
—This is a thin muscular layer placed on the deep surface of
the sternum and costal cartilages. It is continuous below
with the transversus abdominis, and arises from the posterior
surface of the xiphoid process, the lower part of the body of
the sternum, and from the medial ends of the fifth, sixth, and
seventh costal cartilages. Its fibres radiate in an upward and
lateral direction, in the form of five slips, which are inserted
into the deep surfaces and lower borders of the second, third,
fourth, fifth, and sixth costal cartilages, close to their junction
with the ribs (Fig. 3).
In many cases the muscle is feebly developed, and does not show
such wide connections. Upon its anterior aspect are placed the internal
mammary artery and some of the intercostal nerves.
It is only a partial view of the muscle which is obtained in the present
dissection, but it is not advisable to remove the costal cartilages to expose
it further, as this would materially interfere with the subsequent display
of other more important structures in their proper relations.
THORACIC CAVITY.
Before the dissection of the interior of the thorax is com-
menced it is necessary that the dissectors should have some
general knowledge of the cavity and its contents. The shape
and the boundaries have been studied already (p. 1), and it
must now be understood that the cavity is divided into two
lateral parts by a median septum called the mediastinum,
which extends from the sternum anteriorly to the vertebral
column posteriorly, and from the upper aperture of the thorax
above to the diaphragm below.
The mediastinum is formed by the heart, enveloped in a
fibro-serous sac called the pericardium; the great vessels
passing to and from the heart, i.e. the pulmonary artery and
veins, the aorta, and the vena cava superior; the oesophagus;
the trachea and the commencements of the bronchi; the
thoracic duct; the azygos, hemiazygos and accessory hemi-
azygos veins; the vagi and phrenic nerves; numerous lymph
glands; and the areolar tissue in which these structures are
embedded and by which they are bound together. For con-
venience of description the mediastinum is divided into a
superior and an inferior portion, by an imaginary plane
which passes from the lower border of the manubrium sterni
anteriorly, to the lower border of the fourth thoracic vertebra
11
posteriorly; and the inferior mediastinum is subdivided into
anterior, middle, and posterior portions. The anterior
mediastinwn is the part anterior to the pericardium, the
posterior mediastinum the part posterior to the pericardium,
whilst the pericardium and the heart with the great vessels
and the phrenic nerves with their accompanying vessels form
the middle mediastinum. It is customary, however, to speak of
the mediastinum as if it were a space, and to say that the various
viscera, vessels, etc., lie in the mediastina (Fig. 19, p. 44).
The lateral portions of the thoracic cavity are known as
Costal part of parietal pleura Costal part of parietal pleura

the pleural spaces; each contains the corresponding lung
surrounded by an invaginated serous membrane called the
pleural sac. There are therefore two pleural sacs, and each is
so disposed that it not only lines the chamber in which the lung
lies, but is also reflected over the surface of the lung, so as to
give it an external covering which is intimately connected with
the pulmonary substance. Consequently, the wall of each
pleural sac is separable into two portions, an investing or
visceral part which covers the surface of the lung, and a lining or
parietal part which clothes the inner surfaces of the boundary
of each lateral part of the thoracic cavity. It must be clearly
understood, however, that the two terms are merely applied
to indicate different portions of a continuous membrane.
THORAX
Each lung lies free in the pleural space except along its
medial surface, where it is attached to the heart by the
pulmonary vessels, to the corresponding bronchial tube, and
by a fold of pleura to the side of the pericardium.
The dissection which has already been made shows the
pleura lining the deep surfaces of the costal arches and the
internal intercostal muscles. This part is called the costal
pleura, and it is part of the parietal pleura, but before it can
be more fully investigated and before the remaining parts of
the pleurae and the lungs can be examined, further dissection
is necessary.
Dissection.—The pleural membrane previously exposed by the removal
of the contents of the intercostal spaces must now be carefully separated
from the inner surfaces of the ribs by the gentle pressure of the fingers.
The separation should be carried anteriorly to the junction of the ribs
with their cartilages and posteriorly as far as possible. When this has
been done the ribs, from the second to the sixth inclusive, must be divided,
with bone forceps, at their junctions with their cartilages, and at the same
time any fibres of the transversus thoracis which may be attached to them
must be cut. The first and the seventh and those below the seventh must
not be interfered with. Afterwards the ribs must be divided as far
dorsally as possible and the separated portions removed. After the separ-
ated parts of the ribs are detached, remove any sharp spicules of bone
from the cut ends of the remaining portions.
The outer surface of the costal part of the parietal pleura will be exposed
in the area from which the ribs have been removed, and the dissector
should notice that it has the appearance of a fibrous membrane with a
rough surface, the roughness being due to fragments of the connective tissue
(endothoracic fascia) which connect it with the adjacent parts.
After he has examined the outer surface of the pleura, the dissector
should divide it by a vertical incision about midway between the anterior
and posterior borders of the area exposed. At each end of the vertical
incision a transverse incision must be made. One of the two flaps so
formed must be thrown anteriorly, and the other posteriorly. The pleural
sac is now opened and the lateral surface of the lung, covered with the
visceral portion of the pleura, is exposed.
The cavity of the sac and its relations to the mediastinal septum, the
diaphragm, and the root of the neck can be explored with the fingers; and
the borders, surfaces, and the root of the lung can be examined.
The Pleural Sacs are two in number, a right and a left.
They are serous sacs, and are therefore closed. After
opening into the interior, the dissector should notice the
difference between the rough outer surface of the wall of the
sac and its smooth and glistening inner surface, and in order
that he may thoroughly understand the relationship of the
wall of the sac to the lung, the mediastinum and the wall of
the thoracic cavity, he should follow the wall of the sac, with
his fingers, at three different levels—(1) at the level of the
13
manubrium stemi; (2) at the level of the third intercostal
space; and (3) at the level of the fifth costal cartilage. He
must trace the wall of the sac in the vertical plane also.
Commencing at the level of the third intercostal space, he
should place his fingers on the surface of the lung and follow
it anteriorly and medially until, behind the sternum, he reaches
the sharp anterior border, which should be pulled laterally;
then, turning from the lung to the parietal pleura, he should
place his fingers on the inner surface of the anterior flap and
follow it medially. He will find, at a certain point posterior
to the sternum, and to the left of the median plane, that his
fingers cease to pass towards the opposite side but are
carried posteriorly, along the lateral boundary of the medi-
astinum, until they come to the big blood vessels and the air
tube of the lung which collectively form its root. Along the
front of the vessels his fingers will now pass laterally, following
the reflection of the pleura on the front of the vessels, to the
medial surface of the lung, and then anteriorly to its anterior
border. Round the anterior border they will arrive at the
lateral surface of the lung; along this they will pass to the
posterior border and thence anteriorly along the posterior part
of the medial surface to the posterior surface of the root,
where they will feel, distinctly, the hard outline of the
bronchus. Following the posterior surface of the root medially,
they will reach the posterior part of the lateral boundary of
the mediastinum, along which they will pass posteriorly to the
vertebral column, and thence laterally along the posterior parts
of the ribs, and finally anteriorly along the inner surface of the
posterior flap to its anterior margin.
If the dissector has followed the above instructions he
cannot fail to have recognised that the pleural sac is in-
vaginated by the lung, which in its growth laterally from
the mediastinal septum has invaginated and expanded a part
of the medial wall of the sac. The dissector should now
examine a transverse section of a hardened thorax, or if
that is not available, the diagram on p. n. The study of
either will convince him that the lung carrying the in-
vaginated part of the wall of the pleural sac on its surface
has expanded until it has practically obliterated the cavity of
the sac, and he will find that the invaginated pleura on the
surface of the lung, which is called the visceral pleura, is
everywhere in close apposition with the non-invaginated
THORAX
portion which is termed the parietal pleura; all that inter-
venes between the two portions being a thin stratum of fluid,
sufficient to lubricate the surfaces and prevent friction during
the movements of the lung and the chest wall.
After he has grasped the facts noted above the dissector
should follow the inner surface of the pleura in the transverse
plane at the level of the fifth costal cartilage, that is, below
the level of the root of the lung. At that level he will find
that the parietal pleura covering the lateral surface of the
mediastinal septum is connected with the visceral pleura on
the medial surface of the lung by a thin fold, the pulmonary
ligament (O.T. ligamentum latum pulmonis). This consists of
an anterior and a posterior layer, which correspond, respectively,
with the layers on the front and the back of the root of the
lung, but are in contact with each other at the level of
the fifth rib, on account of the absence of the great blood
vessels and air tube of the lung. The pulmonary ligament
extends laterally from the mediastinum to the medial surface
of the lung, and from the root of the lung above, to within
a short distance from the diaphragm below. Its medial,
lateral, and upper borders are attached respectively to the
mediastinal septum, the lung, and the lower border of the
lung root, and are continuous with the pleura covering each,
but its lower border is free. When he has satisfied himself
regarding the nature and the attachments of the pulmonary
ligament, the dissector should trace the pleura in the hori-
zontal plane at the level of the manubrium sterni, that is,
above the level of the root of the lung. There he will find
that the medial wall of the sac is not reflected on to the lung,
but that it passes posteriorly along the lateral surface of the
mediastinal septum from the sternum anteriorly to the vertebral
column posteriorly, and thence laterally and anteriorly to the
sternum in an unbroken circle. In the same way he will
be able to trace the visceral pleura in a similar but smaller
unbroken circle around the upper part of the lung.
Having traced the pleura in three horizontal planes the
dissector must next trace it in the vertical plane, first around
the lung, and then around the wall of the thorax. Commencing
with the lung, the fingers should be passed along the anterior
border to the apex, thence, down the thick posterior border, to
the base, and anteriorly, across the concave base, to the anterior
border. By doing this he will again demonstrate to himself
the fact that the lung is ensheathed in visceral pleura. Next,
placing his r1ngers on the inner surface of the parietal pleura
behind the costal cartilages, he should carry them upwards
towards the head, and he will find that they pass upwards into
the root of the neck for a distance of from one to two inches
above the level of the anterior part of the f1rst rib, but, on
account of the oblique position of the rib, only to the level of
its neck posteriorly. The apex of the sac, therefore, lies in

the root of the neck, and by carefully palpating its inner
surface,the dissector will be able to distinguish the subclavian
artery which passes across its anterior surface below the highest
point, and, possibly, he may be able to locate the internal
mammary and costo-cervical arteries (O.T. superior inter-
costal). The first descends from the subclavian trunk
anterior to the apex of the sac, and the second passes first
upwards to the apex and then posteriorly above it. After the
dissector has examined the position and relations of the
THORAX
apex of the sac he should follow its posterior wall downwards,
just lateral to the line of the vertebral column, and, if he is
dealing with a subject in good condition, he will find that he
can pass his fingers downwards to the lower border of the
twelfth rib, where they will be carried anteriorly on to the
diaphragm and over its surface to the anterior wall of the
thorax. If the dissector carries out the examination of the
pleural sac in a thorough manner, and if he has appreciated
the significance of the arrangements found at different levels,
he will have repeatedly convinced himself that the lung,
carrying the blood vessels and air tube with it, has invaginated
a portion of the lower part of the medial wall of the pleural
sac, and has then expanded anteriorly, posteriorly, upwards and,
to a certain extent, downwards beyond the margins of the
aperture of invagination, whose position is indicated by the
root of the lung and the line of attachment of the pulmonary
ligament. The portion of the wall of the pleura which is
invaginated by the lung is represented by (1) the visceral
pleura, (2) the layers covering the root of the lung, and (3)
the pulmonary ligament.
Before each lung is removed the dissectors should note
that its anterior margin does not extend so far anteriorly, and
the inferior margin does not extend so far downwards, as the
corresponding part of the pleura. The portions of the
pleura unoccupied by the lung are called the pleural sinuses.
The sinus along the anterior margin of the pleura is the
costo-mediastinal sinus, and that along the lower margin, the
phrenico-costal sinus. The walls of the sinuses are separated
by a capillary space filled with pleural fluid, and the margins
of the lungs enter into the sinuses and recede from them
during inspiration and expiration, respectively.
In the event of the lungs not having been hardened in situ by formalin
injection the dissectors may, with the consent of the dissectors of the head
and neck, introduce the nozzle of the bellows into the cervical part of
the trachea and inflate the lungs with air. A truer conception of these
organs will thus be obtained, and a demonstration will be afforded of their
high elasticity, and of their connection with the wind-pipe.
After the dissector has completed the general examination
of the walls of the pleural sac, he should pull the anterior
margin of the lung laterally to expose its medial surface,
the front of the root and the front of the pulmonary ligament;
then he should divide the root and the pulmonary ligament,
from above downwards, close to the medial surface of the
17
lung. The lung, thus set free, is to be removed from the
thorax, wrapped in a cloth damped with preservative solution,
and placed aside for future study.
When the lung has been removed the margins of the
pleural sac must be examined, and their positions relative to
the chest wall noted. This cannot be done to the best
advantage until both lungs have been removed. When this
has been done the dis-
sector should introduce
one hand into each
pleura, and placing an
index finger in each
apex, he should note
that the apex is situated
about one inch above
the junction of the
lateral two-thirds with
the medial third of the
clavicle, a fact which
he can demonstrate
with the aid of his
partner on the opposite
side, who should hold
two macerated clavicles
in their proper posi-
tions. The apices of
opposite sides, there-
fore, are some distance
apart, and are separ-
ated from each other F1g. 6.—Diagram to show the relation of the

THORAX
with the limits of the pleural sacs, he should examine the cut
section of the root of the lung, and should endeavour to
recognise, through the mediastinal part of the parietal pleura,
the positions of the main constituent parts of the mediastinum.
As these vary on the opposite sides, each side must be con-
sidered separately, and each dissector must make himself well
acquainted with the conditions on both sides.
On the right side, in the posterior part of the face of the section
of the lung root, at least two parts of the bronchial tube will
be seen; an upper, which is the so-called eparterial bronchus,
and a lower, the main stem of the right bronchus. Anterior
to and between the two bronchi is the pulmonary artery, and
more anteriorly, and at a slightly lower level, the upper pul-
monary vein. The lower pulmonary vein lies in the lowest
part of the root, below and slightly posterior to the main
bronchus. If the specimen is well injected, branches of the
right bronchial artery may be distinguished on the posterior
faces of the air tubes; and anterior to and between the great
blood vessels, and between them and the bronchi, are a
number of bronchial glands, which are easily distinguished
by the black pigment deposited within them.
In the posterior part of the root of the lung, on the left side,
the dissectors will see the cut section of the left bronchus,
and, in many cases, a section of its first ventral branch also.
The left pulmonary artery is above the bronchus, and its
anterior wall is on a slightly anterior plane. The upper left
pulmonary vein is anterior to the bronchus, and the lower
left pulmonary vein is below the bronchus. In a well in-
jected specimen the two left bronchial arteries may be seen
on the posterior wall of the bronchus, and a number of
bronchial glands will be found between and around the large
blood vessels and the bronchus.
Turning next to the mediastinal pleura on the right side,
the dissectors will note, anterior to and below the root of the
lung, a large bulging, due to the heart and pericardium, which
lie in the middle mediastinal area. Continuous with the
upper and lower ends of the posterior part of this bulging
they will see two longitudinal elevations. The upper, from
the level of the third costal cartilage to the lower margin
of the first rib, is due to the superior vena cava and above
that level, to the right innominate vein. The lower elevation
is very short, and is caused by the upper part of the inferior
23
vena cava. A secondary ridge, formed by the phrenic nerve
and the accompanying blood vessels, descends along the
elevation caused by the superior vena cava, crosses anterior
to the root of the lung, runs down along the posterior part
of the bulging due to the heart, and the anterior border
of the inferior caval elevation. Arching over the root of
the lung is a curved ridge, due to the upper part of the
vena azygos, as it passes anteriorly to join the superior cava.
Above the vena azygos and posterior to the superior cava, the
right lateral surface of the trachea, or main air tube, may
be seen or felt in the superior mediastinal region, and,
descending obliquely across it, from above downwards and
posteriorly, the right vagus nerve can be palpated or seen.
Posterior to the root of the lung and to the bulging due to
the heart, the oesophagus may be recognised in the posterior
mediastinal area, either by touch or sight, or both. Somewhat
posterior to the oesophagus the margin of the ascending
portion of the vena azygos may be noted, and still further
posteriorly are the bodies of the vertebrae and the posterior
parts of the ribs. Crossing the bodies of the vertebrae trans-
versely the right intercostal vessels may be visible or they
may be felt, and, descending along the line of the heads
of the ribs, the ganglionated trunk of the sympathetic can be
recognised by touch, if not by sight.
The dissectors should examine next the mediastinum and
the posterior wall of the thorax on the left side (see Figs.
8, 1 r, and 13).
By inspection and palpation they will easily recognise the
positions of the larger and more important structures. Below
and anterior to the root of the lung the mediastinal pleura is
bulged much more laterally on the left than on the right
side by the heart covered by the pericardium. Arching
posteriorly and to the left, over the root of the lung, in the
superior mediastinal area, is the arch of the aorta, and from
its posterior end the descending aorta runs downwards, in the
posterior mediastinal area, first posterior to the root of the
lung, and then posterior to the heart but separated, in part,
from the latter by the oesophagus, which diverges towards the
left side in the lower part of the thorax. Above the arch of
the aorta the left common carotid and subclavian arteries
and the oesophagus can be distinguished in the above order
antero - posteriorly. A long slender secondary ridge, pro-

descends along the line of the common carotid artery, crosses
the arch of the aorta, and then continues along the side
of the pericardium. Above the aortic arch, and posterior to
the ridge caused by the phrenic nerve, the left vagus nerve
can be seen or felt, as it runs downwards along the anterior
border of the subclavian artery, and then downwards and
posteriorly across the arch of the aorta, to disappear posterior
to the root of the lung. Posterior to the descending aorta the
sympathetic trunk of the left side can be seen or palpated as
it descends along the line of the heads of the ribs.
Anterior to the pericardium and the aortic arch and its
branches, the mediastinal pleura passes forwards to the back of
the sternum in contact with the pleura of the opposite side.
When the inspection and palpation of the structures
lying in relation with the mediastinal and posterior parts of
the costal pleura is satisfactorily completed, the greater part
of the pleura should be removed on both sides.
Dissection. —Make a longitudinal incision through the mediastinal pleura
immediately anterior to the phrenic nerve and a similar incision posterior
to the nerve.
From the anterior longitudinal incision an incision should be carried
anteriorly, at the level of the middle of the root of the lung, and from
the posterior longitudinal incision another cut should be carried posteriorly
to the front of the root of the lung and then along its anterior
surface. Then the root of the lung should be turned anteriorly and
an incision should be made on its posterior surface parallel with that
already made on the anterior surface. This incision should be carried
posteriorly from the root of the lung across the posterior part of the wall
of the mediastinum, and then laterally, across the posterior wall of the
thorax. When the incisions are completed four flaps will be marked out,
two anterior and two posterior.
The upper anterior flap on the right side must be turned anteriorly to the
level of the anterior border of the superior vena cava, where it may be
cut away, the portion of the pleura extending from the superior vena cava
to the sternum being left in situ. The upper anterior flap on the left
side should be turned anteriorly to the anterior part of the arch of the aorta
and the anterior surface of the upper part of the pericardium where it
should be cut away, the part extending further forwards to the sternum
being left in position. The lower anterior flap on each side must also be
turned anteriorly till the anterior part of the pericardium is reached. There
it may be cut away, but the portion of pleura extending from the peri-
cardium to the sternum should not be interfered with at present.
The posterior flaps on each side should be completely removed, care
being taken to avoid injury to any of the structures which they cover.
When the pleura has been removed, both dissectors should study care-
fully the structures exposed on each side, commencing with the right
side.
THORAX
Contents of the Mediastinum and the Structures of the
Posterior Wall of the Thorax seen from the Right Side.—
After the pleura has been removed from the right side of the
thorax and the extra-pleural tissue has been dissected away,
the following structures are exposed. Below and anterior to
the root of the lung is the pericardium. Entering the peri-
cardium below and posteriorly is the thoracic part of the inferior
vena cava, and entering the upper part is the superior vena
cava. The upper end of the superior vena cava is continuous
with the right innominate vein, which lies posterior to the
sternal end of the first costal cartilage. Arching over the root
of the lung, to join the superior vena cava, is the terminal part
of the azygos vein. Above the azygos vein and posterior to
the superior vena cava are parts of the trachea, the right vagus
nerve, and the oesophagus. On the posterior surface of the
root of the lung is the posterior pulmonary plexus, formed by
the vagus nerve, and posterior to the lung root is the vena
azygos. At a lower level, posterior to the pericardium, the
right margin of the oesophagus will be found anterior to the
vena azygos. Lateral to the vena azygos, on the sides of the
bodies of the vertebra?, lie the right aortic intercostal arteries,
the accompanying veins, and the splanchnic nerves. Still
more laterally, on the line of the heads of the ribs, runs the
sympathetic trunk, and beyond the sympathetic trunk are the
intercostal spaces and their contents.
After the various parts mentioned above have been located
and denned, the dissectors should thoroughly clean the
sympathetic trunk and its branches and communications.
In the upper part of the thorax the trunk runs along the
heads of the ribs, but in the lower part it attains a more
anterior position.
The Thoracic Portion of the Sympathetic Trunk.—This is
continuous above with the cervical portion and below with
the abdominal portion. It has the appearance of a knotted
cord. The knots are ganglia, which consist of nerve cells and
fibres. The intermediate parts of the trunk consist of nerve
fibres alone. There are usually eleven ganglia, and, as
a rule, each ganglion lies opposite the head of a rib, but
the first is opposite the medial end of the first intercostal
space, or anterior to the neck of the first rib, and, as the
trunk inclines anteriorly below, one or two of the lower
ganglia lie on the bodies of the lower thoracic vertebrae.

F1g. 12.—Dissection of Thorax from right side showing the constituent parts
of the middle, superior, and posterior mediastina.
(1) Lateral Branches.—From each ganglion two branches
pass laterally into the adjacent intercostal space, where they
THORAX
join the corresponding intercostal nerve. One of these
branches, called the white root of the ganglion, contains
medullated fibres which are passing from the medulla spinalis
(O.T. spinal cord) through the intercostal nerve to the
ganglion. The other, the grey root, consists of non-medullated
fibres which are passing from the cells of the ganglion to the
nerve. Some of these fibres are distributed with the branches
of the nerve, and others run medially, along the intercostal
nerve, to the spinal nerve trunk, whence some are distributed
by the posterior branch and others pass more medially to
the membranes of the medulla spinalis.
(2) Medial Branches. — (a) Pulmonary; (l1) Aortic; (c)
Splanchnic. (a) The pulmonary branches arise from the
second, third, and fourth ganglia. They run anteriorly to the
posterior surface of the root of the lung. There they com-
municate with branches of the vagus, forming a plexus called
the posterior pulmonary plexus. (<$) The aortic branches are
fine filaments which arise from the upper five ganglia and pass
to the coats of the aorta; the dissector will rarely be able to
trace them in an ordinary dissection, (c) The splanchnic
branches arise from the sixth to the last ganglion, and they run
together to form three distinct nerves—the greater, the lesser,
and the lowest splanchnic nerves, which are all destined for
the abdominal viscera.
Nervus Splanchnicus Major.—This nerve is formed by the
union of four or five roots derived from the sixth to the tenth
ganglia, or from the portions of the trunk between. It
passes downwards, on the bodies of the vertebrae, pierces the
diaphragm, and terminates in the coeliac (O.T. semilunar)
ganglion of the same side in the abdomen.
Opposite the last thoracic vertebra there is frequently a small ganglion
upon the greater splanchnic nerve, or connected with it; from this ganglion
branches are distributed to the aorta, where they communicate with their
fellows of the opposite side.
Nervus Splanchnicus Minor.—The small splanchnic nerve
arises by two roots either from the ninth and tenth, or from
the tenth and eleventh ganglia. It also pierces the crus of
the diaphragm and ends in the coeliac ganglion.
Nervus Splanchnicus Imus.—The lowest splanchnic nerve is
a minute branch which springs from the last thoracic ganglion.
It is frequently absent, but when it is present it pierces
the crus of the diaphragm and ends in the renal plexus.
29
Dissection.—When the study of the thoracic portion of the sympathetic
trunk and its branches is completed the posterior parts of the inter-
costal spaces should be cleaned and examined. The internal intercostal
muscles will be seen passing as far medially as the angles of the ribs. In
some cases fibres with the same direction as those of the internal intercostal
muscles will be found descending from one rib to the second or third
below, across the pleural surfaces of the intermediate ribs. Such fibres
constitute the subcostal muscles, which are very variably developed in
different subjects. Sometimes they form an almost complete lining for the
posterior part of the thoracic wall, and in other cases they are represented
by a few scattered fibres, or they are entirely absent.
The Posterior Intercostal Membranes are medial to the
internal intercostal muscles and on a more posterior plane.
Each is attached, medially, to the anterior costo-transverse
ligament, which passes from the neck of the rib below to the
lower border of the transverse process of the vertebra above.
Laterally, it is continuous with the fascial layer between the
internal and external intercostal muscles, and above and
below, it is attached to the adjacent ribs. On the pleural
surface of the posterior intercostal membrane, in each space,
lie the corresponding intercostal nerve and vessels (see Figs.
12 and 13). These pass laterally, on the internal surface
of the membrane, and disappear posterior to the border of
the internal intercostal muscle. When the membranes are
removed the posterior fibres of the external intercostal
muscles will be exposed, passing medially as far as the
tubercles of the ribs.
After the posterior parts of the intercostal spaces and their contents have
been fully considered the vena azygos should be studied. If it is traced
downwards, from above the root of the lung, it will be found to disappear
gradually posterior to the right margin of the oesophagus, which must be
raised to display its lower portion.
The Vena Azygos.—This vein enters the thorax through
the aortic aperture of the diaphragm, to the right of the aorta
and thoracic duct, the lower parts of which will be displayed
as the vein is cleaned. After entering the thorax the vein
ascends, along the right side of the aorta, from which it is
separated by the thoracic duct. A short distance above the
diaphragm it passes more or less completely behind the right
border of the oesophagus. At the lower border of the root
of the lung it emerges from behind the oesophagus, passes
posterior to the lung root, turns anteriorly above its superior
border, at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra, and terminates
in the posterior wall of the superior vena cava, immediately
above the point where the latter enters the pericardium,
3°
THORAX
at the level of the second costal cartilage (see Fig. 12). As
it turns anteriorly the vein lies immediately to the right side
of the oesophagus, trachea and vagus nerve.
The tributaries of the vena azygos are: (1) The right
superior intercostal vein which drains blood from the
greater part of the second and third intercostal spaces.
(2) The eight lower intercostal veins and the subcostal vein
of the right side. (3) The vena hemiazygos, and frequently
(4) the vena hemiazygos accessoria. Both the latter enter it
from the left. In many cases the accessory azygos vein joins
the hemiazygos vein. (5) Two or more bronchial veins from
the right lung. (6) Some veins from the oesophagus. (7)
Some minute pericardial veins.
The vena azygos commences in the abdomen where it
anastomoses either with one of the upper lumbar veins or
directly with the inferior vena cava. Thus it forms a more
or less direct anastomosis between the two venae cavag.
The intercostal veins and the accompanying arteries and
nerves, on both sides, and the hemiazygos and accessory
azygos veins will be studied at a later period of the dissection
(see p. 108).
Contents of the Mediastinum and the Structures of the
Posterior Part of the Left Half of the Thorax seen from the
Left Side.—After the removal of the four pleural flaps described
on p. 25 the following structures are visible on the left side
of the thorax (see Fig. 13). Below and anterior to the root
of the lung is the pericardium, covering the left ventricle, the
left atrium, the conus arteriosus of the right ventricle and the
pulmonary artery. Above the root of the lung is the arch of
the aorta. The arch of the aorta terminates posteriorly in
the descending aorta, which passes downwards posterior to
the root of the lung and the pericardium, but it is separated
from the lower part of the posterior wall of the pericardium
by the oesophagus, which, at this level, is passing towards
the left side. On the left and anterior aspect of the aortic
arch, from behind forwards, lie the left vagus nerve, the
superior cervical cardiac branch of the left sympathetic
trunk, the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the left vagus,
and the left phrenic nerve with its accompanying vessels.
Crossing the arch obliquely, from behind forwards and
upwards, is the left superior intercostal vein, which passes
lateral to the vagus and medial to the phrenic nerve. Above

carotid and left subclavian arteries, and posterior to the latter
lies the oesophagus, with the thoracic duct running along its
left lateral border.
THORAX
Posterior to the descending aorta are the left aortic inter-
costal arteries, the accompanying veins, and the splanchnic
nerves; and still more posteriorly and laterally lie the
sympathetic trunk of the left side and the left intercostal
spaces and their contents.
Dissection.—After the structures exposed by the removal of the left
pleura have been located, the dissectors should direct their attention to the
sympathetic trunk and its branches and communications. The arrange-
ment of these is exactly similar to that already described on the right side
(see p. 26). When the dissectors have confirmed this statement they
should turn to the left subclavian artery, which is the most posterior of the
three great branches which spring from the arch of the aorta. Clean this
vessel without disturbing the vagus nerve, which descends along its anterior
border. Afterwards clean the part of the aortic arch which lies posterior to
the vagus nerve, and the descending aorta. Whilst cleaning the arch avoid
injuring the left superior intercostal vein, and, as the descending aorta is
being cleaned, endeavour to preserve any of the aortic branches of the
sympathetic which may have been found previously during the examination
of the sympathetic trunk.
As the aorta is cleaned the left border of the lower part of the
oesophagus will be brought more clearly into view, but the dissector must
not attempt to clean the oesophagus at this stage.
After the descending portion of the aorta is cleaned, the left aortic
intercostal arteries should be examined. They are nine in number; they
emerge from the posterior aspect of the aorta, and they all pass medial to
the sympathetic trunk as they approach the intercostal spaces. The upper
arteries ascend very obliquely to gain their proper spaces. Accompanying
the arteries are the corresponding veins. The lower veins pass, posterior to
the aorta, to their terminations in the hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos
veins, and will be more fully studied at a later stage; but the veins from
the second and third spaces unite into a trunk called the left superior
intercostal vein.
The Left Superior Intercostal Vein.—This vein is formed
by the intercostal veins from the second and third intercostal
spaces of the left side, and it not uncommonly receives a
communication from the first and fourth spaces. It descends
along the medial border of the first left aortic intercostal
artery to the posterior end of the aortic arch, there it turns
anteriorly, along the left side of the aortic arch, and, passing
at the same time obliquely upwards, it crosses lateral to the
left vagus and medial to the left phrenic nerve. At a later
period of the dissection it will be traced to its termination
in the left innominate vein.
Dissection.—After the left superior intercostal vein has been secured
and studied, the dissectors should clean the region posterior to the left
subclavian artery, and expose thoroughly the left border of the oesophagus,
as that tube lies in the superior mediastinum, and the upper part of the
thoracic portion of the thoracic duct, which runs along the border of the
oesophagus.
33
After this stage of the dissection is completed, the dissectors
should examine the triangular interval between the left phrenic
and left vagus nerves in the upper part of the thorax. Com-
mencing above, they should follow the vagus nerve down-
wards; just before it reaches the lower border of the aortic
arch, it gives off a very distinct branch which turns round
the lower border of the arch. This is the important recurrent
nerve which supplies the majority of the intrinsic muscles of
the larynx of the same side. Immediately anterior and
medial to the point where the recurrent nerve turns beneath
the arch, a very distinct fibrous cord must be defined. It
connects the arch with the upper border of the left pulmonary
artery close to its origin. This is the ligamentum arteriosum,
and it is the remains of the ductus arteriosus, through which
blood passed from the pulmonary artery to the aorta during
fcetal life. When this has been secured the areolar tissue
between the phrenic and vagus nerves must be carefully
removed. In this tissue two small nerves will be found
which run downwards, parallel with the vagus, across the arch
of the aorta. The one next the vagus is the superior cervical
cardiac branch of the left sympathetic, and the one next the
phrenic is the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the left
vagus. When these nerves are followed downwards they
will be found to end in the superficial cardiac plexus, which
lies in the areolar tissue below the aortic arch and to the right
of the ligamentum arteriosum.
Dissection.—After the pericardium has been cleaned, incisions should
be made through it on each side, and the flaps formed should be turned
aside so that the dissectors may make themselves familiar with the relation-
ships of the heart to the mediastinal portions of the pleural sacs. Two
longitudinal incisions must be made on each side, one anterior and one
posterior to the longitudinal strip of pleura left on the lateral surface of the
phrenic nerve (see Figs. 12 and 13). On the right side the incisions should
commence at the level of the upper pulmonary vein. On the left side
the anterior incision should begin at the lower border of the aortic arch
and the posterior at the level of the left pulmonary artery (see Fig. 13).
On both sides the longitudinal incisions must descend to the lower border
of the pericardium. On both sides incisions should be carried anteriorly
from the upper and lower ends of the anterior longitudinal incision to the
line along which the mediastinal pleura was left attached to the anterior
surface of the pericardium (see Figs. 12 and 13). From the upper end of
the posterior longitudinal incision on the right side a cut should be made
downwards and posteriorly along the anterior aspect of the root of the lung
to the upper end of the inferior vena cava (see Fig. 12).
From the upper end of the posterior longitudinal incision on the left side
an oblique cut must be made downwards and posteriorly, along the line of
VOL. II—3
THORAX
the anterior surface of the root of the left lung. When the incisions have
been made, the anterior flaps can be turned anteriorly and the posterior flaps
downwards. None of the flaps must be removed, for it will be necessary
to replace them in position at a later stage of the dissection.
When the flaps marked out by these incisions are turned aside the
dissectors will find that, on the right side, they have exposed the greater
part of the right atrium (see Fig. 12). They should note that the area of
the atrium which is exposed is separated into two parts by a vertical sulcus,
the sulcus temiinalis, which runs from the anterior face of the cardiac end
of the superior vena cava to the anterior aspect of the terminal part of the
inferior vena cava. This sulcus divides the atrium into a posterior part,
the sinus venosus, and an anterior part, the atrium proper, whose upper
and anterior part is prolonged medially to the anterior surface of the heart.
On the left side the greater part of the heart exposed by the reflection of
the pericardial flaps is the left ventricle, but in the upper part of the
area the auricle (O.T. auricular appendage) of the left atrium is seen.
Anterior to it lie the stem of the pulmonary artery and the upper part
of the anterior portion of the right ventricle. A line of fat, in which lie
the interventricular branch of the left coronary artery and the accompany-
ing vein, indicates the position of the septum between the left and right
ventricles (Fig. 13).
After the dissection is completed and the dissectors have carefully noted
the relative positions of the various structures which have been exposed,
they should proceed to study the phrenic nerves, which have been retained in
position by the strips of pleura on their lateral surfaces (see Figs. 12 and 13).
Nervi Phrenici.—Each phrenic nerve arises in the neck
from the cervical plexus, receiving fibres from the third,
fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. It descends on the scalenus
anterior muscle and, at the root of the neck, passes anterior
to the subclavian artery and posterior to the corresponding
vein, but on the left side, as it leaves the scalenus anterior,
it lies anterior to the subclavian artery and posterior to the
commencement of the innominate vein. As it enters the
upper aperture of the thorax it crosses the internal mammary
artery, passing from its lateral to its medial side, then
it descends along the lateral border of the mediastinum,
anterior to the root of the lung, to the diaphragm where
it breaks up into branches. The majority of the branches
pass between the muscular fibres of the diaphragm and,
after communicating with the abdominal sympathetic nerve
fibres which form the diaphragmatic plexus, they are
distributed to the muscle from its lower surface. The re-
lations of the phrenic nerves in the thorax are different
on the two sides, and the left phrenic nerve, as a whole, is
on a plane somewhat anterior to the right.
The right phrenic nerve descends along the lateral borders
of the right innominate vein and the superior vena cava to
the point where the latter enters the pericardium, then along
35
the side of the pericardium, which separates it from the
venous sinus of the right atrium (see Fig. 12).
The Left Phrenic Nerve.—In the upper part of the thorax
the left phrenic nerve runs downwards between the left
common carotid and the left subclavian arteries and, whilst
lying between them, it crosses anterior to the left vagus and
posterior to the left innominate vein. In the lower part of
the superior mediastinum it passes lateral to the arch of the
aorta and the left superior intercostal vein, then, descending
into the middle mediastinum, it lies at first anterior to the
root of the left lung, and afterwards it runs downwards along
the side of the pericardium, which separates it from the
anterior part of the left atrium and from the lateral part of
the left ventricle of the heart.
The left phrenic nerve is longer than its fellow of the right side, partly
on account of the lower position of the diaphragm, and partly on account
of the greater projection of the heart on the left side.
Branches of the Phrenic Nerves.—The main distribution
of the phrenic nerves is to the diaphragm, but some minute
sensory twigs are given off by each nerve to the pericardium
and to the pleura. The student should note the great import-
ance of the phrenic nerves. They are the nerves of supply
to the diaphragm, which is the chief muscle of respiration.
Pulmones.—Before proceeding to the further dissection
of the constituent parts of the mediastinum, the dissectors
should study the lungs which they previously removed. The
lungs are two soft, comparatively light, spongy organs placed
one on either side of the mediastinum. The weight of the
right lung, when it is filled with an average amount of blood,
is 22 oz. and that of the left 20 oz. When the thorax is
opened the lungs collapse to about one-third of their original
bulk (unless they have been hardened in situ), and it is
difficult for the student to realise their proper size and
shape until they are distended to their original dimensions
with the aid of the bellows (see p. 16).
When healthy and sound, the lungs lie free within the
cavity of the chest, and are attached only by their roots and
by their pulmonary ligaments. It is rare, however, that a
healthy lung is seen in the dissecting-room, for adhesions be-
tween the visceral and parietal portions of the pleura, due to
pleurisy, are generally present. Each lung is accurately
adapted to the space in which it lies, and, when hardened
11—3 a
THORAX
in situ, it bears on its surface impressions and elevations
which are an exact counterpart of the inequalities of the
structures with which its surfaces are in contact at the
moment of fixation.
In the natural condition each lung resembles half a cone,
and it presents for examination an apex, a base, a costal
surface, a medial surface. An anterior and a posterior border
separate the medial from the lateral surface; and an inferior
or basal border separates the base from the medial and lateral

surfaces. The apex rises into the root of the neck for one
and a half inches above the level of the anterior part of the
first rib, and it is crossed by the subclavian artery, which
makes a groove upon the anterior border, a short distance
below the summit, although the artery is separated from the
lung by the membranous cervical diaphragm (Sibson's fascia),
and by the pleura.
The base of each lung has a semilunar outline and is
adapted to the upper surface of the diaphragm. Consequently
it is deeply hollowed out, and, as the right cupola of the
37
diaphragm ascends higher than the left, the basal concavity
of the right lung is deeper than that of the left lung. The
lateral and posterior parts of the basal margin of the lung
are thin and sharp and extend downwards into the phrenico-
costal "sinus of the pleura, which intervenes between the
diaphragm and the wall of the thorax. This margin reaches a
much lower position posteriorly and laterally than anteriorly,
but in all situations it falls considerably short of the bottom of
the sinus. The mediastinal part of the basal marg1n, which
lies along the lower border of the pericardium, is more
rounded.
The diaphragm separates the base of the right lung from

the upper surface of the right lobe of the liver, and the base
of the left lung from the left lobe of the liver, the stomach,
the spleen, and, in some cases, from the left extremity of the
transverse colon.
The costal surface of the lung is very extensive and convex.
It lies in relation with the costal pleura, which separates it
from the ribs and intercostal muscles, the transversus thoracis
and the sternum, and it bears the impressions of the costal
arches.
The medial surface is separable into an anterior or mediastinal
portion and a posterior or vertebral portion. The vertebral
portion lies against the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae.
The mediastinal part is applied against the mediastinal
partition and presents markings which are the exact counter-
parts of the inequalities of the corresponding lateral surface
n—3 6

of the mediastinum. Thus, it is deeply hollowed out in
adaptation to the pericardium upon which it fits. The
pericardial concavity occupies the greater part of the
mediastinal surface, and, owing to the greater projection
of the heart to the left side, it is much more extensive in
the left lung than in the right lung.

F1g. 1 6.—Medial of a Left Lung hardened in situ.
At the upper and posterior part of the pericardial area is
the hilus of the lung. This is a wedge-shaped depressed area
through which the bronchus and the pulmonary artery enter
and the pulmonary veins and lymphatics leave the lung. It
is surrounded by the pleura which is reflected from its margin
on to the root of the lung, and the layer of reflected pleura
round the hilus is continuous, below, with the pulmonary
ligament. The portion of the pericardial area anterior to the
upper part of the hilus of the left lung corresponds with the
39
position of the conus arteriosus and the stem of the pulmonary
artery, and the same portion of the pericardial area on the
right side corresponds with the position of the lower part of
the superior vena cava posteriorly and with the ascending
aorta anteriorly (Fig. 17). Below and posterior to the lower

F1g. 17.—The Medial Surface of a Right Lung hardened in situ.
and posterior part of the pericardial area on the right lung is a
secondary depression due to the upper part of the inferior
vena cava. Posterior to the pericardial area and the hilus
there is a narrow strip of the mediastinal surface of the lung
which is in relation with the lateral wall of the posterior
mediastinum. On the right lung this portion of the
surface presents a longitudinal depression which corresponds
with the right border of the oesophagus, and more posteriorly
at the upper part there may be a groove caused by the vena
THORAX
azygos. The left lung in the corresponding situation is
marked by a deep longitudinal groove which is produced
by the contact of the lung with the descending thoracic
aorta; and, close to the base, a small triangular area, anterior
to the aortic groove, lies in relation with the left border of
the lowest part of the thoracic portion of the oesophagus.
The portion of the mediastinal surface which lies above
the hilus and pericardial hollow is applied to the lateral
aspect of the superior mediastinum and the markings upon
it are different on the two sides. On the left side a broad
deep groove, caused by the aortic arch, curves over the hilus
and becomes continuous posteriorly with the aortic groove
on the posterior mediastinal area. From this arched groove
a sharply cut sulcus, caused by the left subclavian artery,
ascends on the medial side of the apex and, turning laterally
above, it crosses the anterior border of the apex a short
distance below the summit. Immediately anterior to the
subclavian sulcus the medial surface of the apex is occasion-
ally marked by a shallow sulcus caused by the lateral margin
of the left innominate vein, and more inferiorly its anterior
margin is depressed by the first rib. That portion of the
surface which lies posterior to the subclavian sulcus is
separated by areolar tissue from the oesophagus.
On the right lung also a curved sulcus arches over the
hilus. It is caused by the vena azygos, as it passes anteriorly
to join the superior vena cava. This groove is much narrower
and less distinct than the sulcus on the left lung due to the
aortic arch. From the anterior end of the sulcus for the
azygos vein a broad shallow sulcus passes upwards to the
lower and anterior part of the apex. This is produced by
the superior vena cava and the innominate vein, and in some
cases it is prolonged to the upper part of the apex by a
slight longitudinal depression due to the pressure of the
internal jugular vein. Arching laterally, across the upper
part of the anterior aspect of the apex, there is a shallow groove
produced by the right subclavian artery. Posterior to the sulcus
for the innominate vein, the medial surface of the apex lies in
relation with the right side of the trachea, and still further
posteriorly it is either in relation with the right lateral border
of the superior mediastinal part of the oesophagus, or it is
separated from it by a mass of areolar tissue.
The anterior and posterior borders of the lung are in
41
marked contrast with each other. The anterior is compara-
tively short and thin and it extends medially into the costo-
mediastinal sinus of the pleura, which lies posterior to the
sternum and the costal cartilages. It commences at the apex,
curves downwards, anteriorly and medially, posterior to the
sterno-clavicular articulation, to the lower border of the
manubrium sterni, and then it descends vertically to the base.
Immediately below the highest point of the apex it is grooved
by the subclavian artery on each side, and on the left side it
presents a cardiac notch at the level of the fifth costal cartilage.
The posterior border is rounded and indistinct. It descends
from the apex to the base, along the line of the articulations of
the heads of the ribs with the bodies of the vertebrae, and
it is much longer than the anterior border.
Lobes of the Lungs.—The left lung is divided into two
lobes by a long, deep oblique fissure which penetrates its
substance to within a short distance of the hilus. This fissure
begins above at the posterior border, about two and a half
inches below the apex, at the level of the vertebral end of
the third rib, which corresponds with the medial end of the
spine of the scapula. It is continued on the lateral surface,
in a somewhat spiral direction, downwards and anteriorly till it
cuts the inferior margin opposite the lateral part of the costal
cartilage. The upper lobe of the lung lies above and anterior
to this cleft. It is conical in form, with an oblique base.
The apex and the whole of the anterior border belong to it.
The lower lobe, somewhat quadrangular, is more bulky than the
upper, and lies below and posterior to the fissure; it comprises
the entire base and the greater part of the thick posterior
border.
In the right lung there are two fissures subdividing it into
three lobes. The oblique fissure is very similar in its position
and relations to the fissure in the left lung, but it is more
vertical in direction. It separates the lower lobe from the
upper and middle lobes. The second cleft, the horizontal
fissure, begins at the anterior border of the lung at the level
of the fourth costal cartilage and extends horizontally till it
joins the oblique fissure. The middle or intermediate lobe,
thus cut off, is wedge-shaped in outline. It lies between the
oblique and horizontal fissures.
Differences between the two Lungs.—The dissectors should
particularly note the following differences between the two
THORAX
lungs :—(1) The right lung is slightly larger than the left, in
the proportion of 1 1 to 10. (2) The right lung is shorter
and wider than the left lung. This difference is due to
the great bulk of the right lobe of the liver, which elevates
the right cupola of the diaphragm to a higher level than
the left cupola, and also to the heart and pericardium, which
project more to the left than the right, and thus diminish
the width of the left lung. (3) The anterior sharp
margin of the right lung is more or less straight; the
corresponding margin of the left lung presents, in its lower
part, a marked angular' deficiency (incisura cardiaca) for the
EPARTERIAL

F1g. 18.—The two Pulmonary Roots transversely divided close to the
hilus of each lung.
reception of the heart and the pericardium. (4) The right
lung is subdivided into three lobes, and the left lung into two.
Radix Pulmonis.—The root of the lung is formed by a
number of structures which enter the lung at the hilus or
slit on its mediastinal surface. The structures which form
the root are held together by an investment of pleura, and
they constitute a pedicle which attaches the lung to the
contents of the mediastinum. The pleura has already been
removed from around them, and now a more detailed
examination of the constituent parts of the root and of its
relations must be made. The portion of the root still
43
attached to the mediastinum should be used for this
purpose.
Dissection.—Commence with the vagus nerve and follow it downwards
from a point just above the vena azygos on the right side, and from the arch
of the aorta on the left, looking carefully for small branches which spring
from its anterior border and pass to the anterior surface of the root, where
they communicate with the twigs from the sympathetic ganglia, and from
the deep cardiac plexus, to form the anterior pulmonary plexus, from
which branches are distributed to the walls of the air tube and the blood
vessels. On the left side a few twigs may be found passing from the super-
ficial cardiac plexus to the anterior pulmonary plexus. After the branches
of the vagus to the anterior pulmonary plexus have been identified, the
trunk of the vagus, on each side, must be followed down to the posterior
surface of the root of the lung, where it breaks up into branches which
- unite with twigs from the corresponding sympathetic trunk to form the
posterior pulmonary plexus (see p. 28). The posterior pulmonary plexuses
of opposite sides are connected together by strong branches, which pass
both anterior and posterior to the oesophagus, and each gives branches to the
walls of the bronchial tube and the blood vessels of the root of its own side.
These various branches must be found and identified. After the posterior
pulmonary plexuses are satisfactorily displayed the bronchial blood vessels
should be found and cleaned.
Arteriae Bronchiales.— As a rule, two bronchial arteries are
distributed to the left lung and one to the right lung. The
two left bronchial arteries spring from the descending aorta.
The right bronchial artery is a branch either of the first right
aortic intercostal artery or of the upper left bronchial artery.
The bronchial arteries and their branches run along the
posterior surfaces of the bronchi and their branches, and
are the proper nutrient vessels of the lungs. Part of the
blood which they convey to the lungs is returned by the pul-
monary veins to the left atrium of the heart, but the remainder
is returned by bronchial veins, which open on the right side
into the vena azygos, and on the left side into the vena
hemiazygos accessoria, or into the left superior intercostal
vein.
Dissection.—After the bronchial vessels have been traced, the dissector
should separate the great vessels and the air tube from each other. Whilst
attempting this, he will find that his work is greatly impeded by the
hardened and pigmented bronchial glands. The relative positions of the
constituent parts of the roots of the lung have been noted already (p. 22).
The Relations of the Roots of the Lungs.—Anterior to the
root of each lung are the phrenic nerve, with its accompanying
vessels, and the anterior pulmonary plexus; behind it, the
posterior pulmonary plexus, and below it, the ligamentum
pulmonis. In addition, in front of the root of the right lung

stronger than the cusps of the pulmonary valve described on
p. 75, but correspond with them in all details of structure.

orif1ce and thinnest at the apex, and he should examine the
inter-ventricular septum.
The Inter-ventricular Septum.—The inter-ventricular septum
is a musculo-membranous partition which separates the left
ventricle not only from the right ventricle, but also from the
lower part of the right auricle. In the greater part of its
extent the septum is thick and muscular, and is thickest below
and anteriorly, where it springs from the lower border of the
heart immediately to the right of the apex and opposite the
83
cardiac notch. The muscular part becomes gradually thinner
as it passes upwards and posteriorly and, a short distance
from the atrio-ventricular orifices, it terminates in a fibrous
membrane, the pars membranacea septi, which connects the
muscular part of the septum with the fibrous rings which
surround the atrio-ventricular orifices and the orifices of the
pulmonary artery and the aorta. The pars membranacea is
the thinnest part of the septum. Occasionally it is deficient
in whole or in part, and in such cases a communication
exists between the two ventricles, and, in some rare cases,
between the left ventricle and the right auricle.
The pars membranacea was exposed from the right side
when the anterior part of the medial cusp of the tricuspid
valve was removed during the dissection of the atrio-ventri-
cular bundle (see p. 74).
Finally the dissector should note that the inter-ventricular
septum is placed obliquely, so that its anterior border lies to
the left and its inferior border to the right; and that its
right lateral surface, which looks anteriorly and to the right,
bulges towards the cavity of the right ventricle (Fig. 37).
The Aorta.—The aorta is the great arterial trunk of the
body. It commences from the upper, anterior and right
portion of the left ventricle, at the level of the third inter-
costal spaces and posterior to the left margin of the sternum.
It terminates at the level of the lower border of the fourth
lumbar vertebra, to the left of the median plane, where it
divides into the right and left common iliac arteries. It is
described as consisting of three main parts: (1) the ascend-
ing part, (2) the arch, and (3) the descending part. The
descending part is divided into (a) thoracic and (b) abdominal
portions. The first two parts and the thoracic portion of the
third part are met with in the dissection of the thorax.
The Ascending Part of the Aorta.—The ascending aorta
commences at the aortic orifice of the left ventricle and runs
upwards to the right and slightly anteriorly, posterior to the
first piece of the body of the sternum, to the level of the sternal
end of the right second costal cartilage, where it becomes the
arch of the aorta. It lies in the middle mediastinum, is
enclosed in the fibrous sac of the pericardium, and is en-
sheathed by a covering of the serous sac which is common
to it and the stem of the pulmonary artery. The lumen of
this portion of the aorta is not of uniform diameter; on the
11—6«

contrary it presents four dilatations, three at the commence-
ment, the aortic sinuses (Valsalva), and one along the right
border, the great sinus of the aorta. The latter is merely an
indefinite bulging along the right border of the vessel.

is in direct relation with the anterior wall of the pericardium,

the right auricle below and the superior vena cava above; and

stem of the pulmonary artery above.
Branches. — Only two branches are given off from the
ascending part of the aorta; they are the right and left
coronary arteries. The right springs from the anterior
aortic sinus and the left from the left posterior sinus. Their
distribution has been described already (p. 60).
The Superficial Cardiac Plexus.—Before the arch of the
aorta is studied, the position, connections and relations of the
superficial cardiac plexus should be defined. It lies below
the arch of the aorta, above the bifurcation of the stem of the
pulmonary artery, and between the ascending aorta on the
right and anteriorly, and the ligamentum arteriosum to the left
and posteriorly. The positions of the superior cervical cardiac
branch of the left sympathetic trunk, and the inferior cervical
cardiac branch of the left vagus, on the left side of the
arch of the aorta, have been defined already (p. 33).
Trace these nerves to the plexus, clear away the areolar
tissue from around the plexus, and trace branches posteriorly
and upwards from it towards the deep cardiac plexus, which
lies posterior to the arch of the aorta. Other branches which
spring from the superficial part of the cardiac plexus descend
along the pulmonary artery and form the right coronary
plexus, which is distributed with the right coronary artery.
The Arch of the Aorta.—The aortic arch commences at the
termination of the ascending part of the aorta, at the level of
the second costal cartilage, and posterior to the right margin of
the sternum, from which it is separated by the anterior part
of the mediastinal portion of the right pleura and lung, or
by the remains of the thymus gland (see Fig. 43). It runs
posteriorly, to the left, and slightly upwards, through the middle
mediastinum and round the left margins of the trachea and
oesophagus (see Figs. 13 and 43), to the level of the lower
border of the left side of the fourth thoracic vertebra, where it
becomes continuous with the descending part of the aorta. It
is curved in both the vertical and the horizontal planes, and as
it passes posteriorly and to the left it forms a convexity
upwards, and also a convexity which is directed anteriorly and
to the left. Its lower border is connected with the left
pulmonary artery by the ligamentum arteriosum, and from its
upper border arise the three great vessels which supply the
head, neck, and upper extremities.
THORAX
Relations.—Above, the left innominate vein runs along its
upper border immediately anterior to the origins of the in-
nominate artery, the left common carotid artery and the left
subclavian artery, which spring from its upper border; the first
arises from the apex of the convexity, posterior to the centre

of the manubrium sterni; the second arises close to, and some-
times in common with the first, whilst the origin of the
subclavian is a little more posterior and to the left, separated
by a distinct interval from the left common carotid (Figs. 20 and
24). Below the arch lie (1) the bifurcation of the pulmonary
artery and portions of its right and left branches; (2) the liga-
87
mentum arteriosum, which connects the left pulmonary artery
with the arch; (3) the superficial part of the cardiac plexus
immediately to the right of the ligamentum arteriosum; (4)
the left recurrent nerve on the left side of the ligament; and (5)
still further to the left, the left bronchus passes beneath the
arch on its way to the hilus of the left lung. To the right of the
arch are the trachea, the oesophagus, the left recurrent nerve,
and the thoracic duct. The nerve lies in the angle between
the oesophagus and the trachea, and the thoracic duct is pos-
terior to and to the left of the oesophagus (Fig. 43). The left
side of the arch is overlapped by the posterior part of the media-
stinal surface of the left pleura and lung, but intervening
between the pleura and the arch are (1) the left phrenic nerve,
(2) the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the left vagus, (3)
the superior cervical cardiac branch of the left sympathetic,
(4) the left vagus, and (5) the left superior intercostal vein.
The vein passes upwards and anteriorly, lying to the left of
the vagus and the cardiac nerves, and to the right of the
phrenic nerve (Fig. 13).
Dissection.—Divide the right coronary artery close to its origin. Cut
through the anterior wall of the ascending part of the aorta on each side of
the anterior aortic sinus; extend the incisions upwards to the commencement
of the aortic arch, and examine the aortic valve. Note that it is formed by
three semilunar cusps which are much stronger than the semilunar cusps of
the pulmonary valve (p. 75), but are exactly similar in structure and
attachments. Note further that one cusp lies anteriorly, and the other two
posteriorly. Examine the aortic sinuses and note that the right coronary
artery springs from the anterior sinus, and the left coronary from the left
posterior sinus. Note further that the orifices of the coronary arteries, as a
rule, lie immediately above the level of the upper margins of the semilunar
cusps. Replace the stem of the pulmonary artery in position, and note the
relative positions of the pulmonary, aortic, and atrio-ventricular orifices.
Topography of the Great Orifices of the Heart.—Replace
the sternum in position and note the relations of the cardiac
orifices to that bone. The pulmonary orifice is highest. It
lies to the left of the margin of the sternum at the level of the
third costal cartilage. The aortic orifice is a little lower, and
more to the right, posterior to the left margin of the sternum,
at the level of the third left intercostal space. Below the aortic
orifice is the left atrio-ventricular orifice, posterior to the left
margin of the sternum at the level of the left fourth costal
cartilage. Still lower and more to the right is the right atrio-
ventricular orifice, posterior to the centre of the sternum at the
level of the fourth intercostal spaces (Fig. 44).
THORAX
Dissection.-—Divide the phrenic nerves immediately above the diaphragm;
then, with the handle and the edge of the scalpel, detach the lower part
of the pericardium from the diaphragm. The attachment of the peri-
cardium to the muscular part of the diaphragm is not close, and can
easily be broken down. The attachment to the central tendon is much
more firm and, as the median plane is approached, the aid of the edge of
the knife will probably be necessary before a separation can be effected.

Divide the right innominate vein and the right phrenic nerve, immediately
above the upper end of the superior vena cava, and as the division is made
take care not to injure the right vagus posterior to the vein. Then divide
the vena azygos just posterior to its entrance into the superior vena cava.
Cut the inferior thyreoid veins, the innominate artery, and the left common
carotid artery, immediately above the upper border of the left innominate
vein, and then divide the left innominate vein, in the interval between the
left common carotid and the left subclavian arteries. Cut the left phrenic
89
nerve, the superior cardiac branch of the left sympathetic, and the inferior
cervical cardiac branch of the left vagus, immediately above the upper
border of the aortic arch. Next divide the aortic arch. Enter the knife at
the upper border of the arch, between the left common carotid and left
subclavian arteries and anterior to the left vagus and the left recurrent
nerve, and cut from above downwards, completing the division of the
arch at the lower border, immediately to the left of the upper end of
the ligamentum arteriosum. The left superior intercostal vein will be
divided at the same time, but care must be taken not to injure the left
recurrent nerve, which is curving round the arch from the front to the
back. When the incisions are completed, pull the anterior part of the
aortic arch, with the superior vena cava and the lower parts of the innomi-
nate veins, anteriorly, and separate them from the lower part of the
trachea and from the bronchi. As the separation proceeds, keep the edge
of the knife turned towards the aortic arch, to avoid injury to the deep part
of the cardiac plexus, which lies anterior to the bifurcation of the trachea.
When the lower border of the arch is reached, the twigs which connect the
superficial with the right half of the deep part of the cardiac plexus will
be exposed, and must be divided. When this has been done detach the
posterior surface of the pericardium from the front of the oesophagus and
the descending aorta, taking care to avoid injury to the plexus formed by
the vagi nerves on the anterior aspect of the oesophagus. As soon as the
separation is completed, the heart, with the remains of the pericardium and
the lower parts of the phrenic nerves, can be removed from the thorax, and
the investigation of the left atrium and the structure of the heart can
be proceeded with; but, before this is done, the dissector should note that
the posterior wall of the pericardium intervenes between the posterior wall
of the left atrium and the anterior surfaces of the oesophagus and the
descending part of the aorta, as the latter structures lie anterior to the
middle four thoracic vertebrae (Fig. 21).
After the heart and the roots of the great vessels have been removed from
the thorax, fasten the left vagus and the recurrent nerve to the part of the
arch left in s1tu by one or two points of suture; then cut away the remains
of the pericardium from the heart, leaving only those portions of it which
mark the lines of reflection of the parietal to the visceral portions of the
serous sac. Note, as the posterior wall of the pericardium is removed, that
it forms the posterior boundary of the oblique sinus (p. 21).
The Left Atrium.—The left atrium, like the right, is
separable into two parts—a larger main portion, the atrium
proper or body; and a long narrow prolongation, the auricle
(O.T. auricular appendage), which runs from the left margin
of the body anteriorly and to the right. The four pulmonary
veins, two on each side, open into the left atrium. They enter
close to the upper ends of the lateral borders of the posterior
surface, and not uncommonly the right or the left pair may
fuse into a common trunk at the point of entrance.
It has been noted previously that the left atrium forms
the greater part of the base of the heart, a small part of the
anterior or sterno-costal surface, and a still smaller part of
the left border. The only part which can be seen from the
front, when the heart is in situ, is the apical portion of the
9o
THORAX
auricle (appendage), for the portion which enters into the
formation of the sterno-costal surface is hidden by the roots
of the aorta and the pulmonary artery (Fig. 35).
The posterior wall of the left atrium is of quadrangular
outline. Along its superior border lie the pulmonary arteries.

sulcus, in which lies the coronary sinus, and on the right by
an indistinct inter-atrial sulcus, which indicates the position
of the posterior border of the inter-atrial septum. Descending
obliquely across the posterior wall of the left atrium, from
the lower border of the left inferior pulmonary vein, down-
wards and to the right to the coronary sinus, is the oblique
vein (Marshall), which is the remains of the left duct of
91
Cuvier of the foetus. Occasionally it becomes the lower end
of a left superior vena cava.
Dissection.—Open the left atrium by three incisions—one horizontal and
two vertical. The horizontal incision must run from side to side along the
lower border of the atrium, immediately above the coronary sulcus; and
the vertical incisions must ascend from the extremities of the horizontal to
the upper border of the posterior surface, each passing to the medial side
of the terminations of the corresponding pulmonary veins. When the
incisions have been made the posterior wall of the atrium must be turned
upwards whilst the cavity is being examined.
Aorta Left pulmonary veins

Coronary sinus
F1g. 46.—The Left Atrium opened from behind. The greater part of
the posterior wall has been thrown upwards.
The inner surface of the wall of the left atrium is smooth
and generally devoid of muscular bundles, but the inner
surface of the wall of its auricle (O.T auricular appendage) is
covered with musculi pectinati, a fact which can be demon-
strated by carrying an incision anteriorly into it. As this
incision is made, the dissectors should note that, in a formalin
hardened heart, a strong muscular ridge descends along the
left border of the cavity anterior to the orifices of the left
pulmonary veins, entirely concealing them from view when the
cavity is examined from the front.
On the right or septal wall of the left atrium the position
THORAX
of the valve of the foramen ovale is marked by one or more
small semilunar depressions situated between slender muscular
ridges. The portion of the septal wall which lies below and
posterior to these depressions forms the floor of the fossa
ovalis, and is the remains of the valve of the foramen ovale of
the foetus.
The Orifices of the Left Atrium.—The orifices of the left
atrium are the openings of the four pulmonary veins, which
convey to it the oxygenated blood from the lungs; a number
of minute openings which are the mouths of the vena cordis
minima; and the left atrioventricular orifice through which
blood passes from the left atrium to the left ventricle.
The openings of the pulmonary veins are situated in the
posterior wall, nearer the upper than the lower part, and close
to the lateral borders, two on each side. They are entirely
devoid of valves. The orifices of the venae cordis minimae,
which are scattered irregularly, are also valveless; but the left
atrio-ventricular orifice, which lies in the lower part of the
anterior wall of the atrium, is guarded by a bicuspid valve, the
mitral valve, which has been described already (p. 79). This
orifice is smaller than the corresponding orifice on the right
side, and admits the tips of two fingers only.
The Structure of the Walls of the Heart.—The last step in the dissection
of the heart consists in the examination of the structure of its walls. On
the outside the walls are covered with the epicardium, which is the visceral
part of the serous pericardium; and on the inside they are lined with the
smooth and glistening endocardium, which plays a large part in the
formation of the flaps of the valves, and is continuous, through the
orifices, with the inner coats of the arteries and veins. Between the
epicardium and the endocardium lies the muscular tissue of the heart,
which is termed the myocardium. The muscular fibres of the myo-
cardium are disposed in layers, in each of which the fibres take a special
direction.
The arrangement of the various layers of the myocardium cannot be
displayed in an ordinary dissecting-room heart, in which the continuity of
the fibres has been destroyed by the incisions made to display the cavities,
but the arrangement of the layers is practically the same in the hearts of
all mammals. Therefore, for the purpose of studying the layers, the
dissector should obtain a sheep's heart. This should be filled with a
paste made of flour and water; then it should be boiled for a quarter of an
hour. The boiling expands the paste, softens the connective tissue, and
hardens the muscular fibres. After the boiling is finished the heart should
be placed for a time in cold water. After it has cooled, first the epicardium
and then the muscular fibres should be gradually torn off.
The atrial fibres are diff1cult to dissect. They consist of three groups:
(1) A superficial group running more or less transversely and common to
both atria. They are best marked near the coronary sulcus. (2) A deep
group special to each auricle. The extremities of these fibres are connected
93
with the fibrous atrio-ventricular rings, and they pass over the auricles from
front to back. (3) The third group consists of sets of annular fibres
surrounding the orifices of the veins which open into the atria.
The fibres of the ventricles are more easily dissected. They consist,
for the main part, of two groups—the superficial and the deep. The fibres
of each set are common to both ventricles, and the dissectors should note
the remarkable spiral or whorled arrangement of the superficial fibres
which occurs at the apex, where they pass into the deeper parts of the wall.
The superficial fibres spring mainly from the fibrous atrio-ventricular
rings. Those which are attached to the right ring turn inwards at the
apex and become continuous with the papillary muscles of the left ventricle,
whilst the fibres which spring from the left ring pass in the same way to
the papillary muscles of the right ventricle. The deeper fibres form an
CD-shaped layer, one loop of the CO surrounding the right and the other the
left ventricle.
The fibrous rings of the atrio-ventricular orifices intervene between the
atrial and the ventricular muscle fibres, but the two groups are brought
into association with each other by the atrio-ventricular bundle described
on p. 74, It has been assumed that the impulses which regulated the
movements of the ventricles were conveyed to them from the atria by
the fibres of this bundle, but it has been shown recently that numerous
nerve fibrils are intimately intermingled with the fibres of the atrio-
ventricular bundle. It is possible, therefore, that the connection between
the atria and the ventricles is neuro-muscular.
The Action of the Heart.—The differences between the various parts of
the heart, i.e. the thinness of the walls of the atria as contrasted with the
thickness of the walls of the ventricles, and the greater thickness of the
walls of the left as contrasted with those of the right ventricle, are associated
with the functions of the various chambers, and with the action which the
heart plays in the maintenance of the circulation of the blood. The heart
is a muscular pump, provided with receiving and ejecting chambers. It
has three phases of action: (1) a period of atrial contraction; (2) a period
of ventricular contraction, which immediately succeeds the atrial con-
traction; (3) a period of diastole or rest.
During the period of diastole or rest the chambers, previously con-
tracted, dilate, as the muscular fibres of the heart relax. The dilatation is
aided by the respiratory movements of the thorax. As the dilatation pro-
gresses blood flows into the right atrium from the superior vena cava, the
inferior vena cava, and the coronary sinus; and into the left atrium through
the four pulmonary veins. The atrial contraction commences with the
contraction of the circular fibres which surround the mouths of the veins
entering the atria, and thus the blood is prevented from passing back
into the veins. As the contraction extends to the general fibres of the atria
the blood is forced onwards into the ventricles, which become distended.
Then the ventricular contraction commences, the atrio-ventricular valves
close, and, as the contraction proceeds, the blood is driven out of the
ventricles through the arterial orifices, that in the right ventricle being
ejected into the pulmonary artery, and that in the left ventricle into the aorta.
When the ventricular contraction is completed the period of diastole
commences; and, as long as the heart remains alive, the cycle is repeated.
The work of the atria is merely to force the blood through the widely
open atrio-ventricular orifices into the ventricles and to expand the dilating
walls of the ventricles. For this purpose no great force is required, there-
fore the walls of the atria are thin. The work of the ventricles is much
more severe, therefore their walls are thicker, but the right ventricle has
only to exert sufficient force to drive the blood through the lungs to the left
THORAX
auricle, that is, through a comparatively short distance and against a com-
paratively small resistance; therefore its walls are thin as compared with
the walls of the left ventricle, which has to be sufficiently strong to force
the blood through the whole of the trunk, the head and neck, and the upper
and lower limbs.
The Topography of the Heart.—Before proceeding to the
study of the trachea, the dissectors should replace the heart
in position and revise their knowledge of its relations to the
surface. Its position can be indicated on the anterior wall
of the thorax by the following four lines:—(1) A line com-
mencing at the lower border of the second left costal
cartilage, half an inch from the left border of the sternum,
and ending at the upper border of the third right costal
cartilage, half an inch from the right border of the sternum.
This line indicates the position of the upper border of the
heart, which is formed by the atria. (2) A line from
the upper border of the third right costal cartilage to the
sixth right costal cartilage. This line should commence
and end half an inch from the border of the sternum, and
should be slightly convex to the right. It indicates the
right border of the heart, which is formed by the right atrium
alone. (3) A line from the sixth right costal cartilage to the
apex, which lies behind the fifth left intercostal space three
and a half inches from the median plane. This line marks
the position of the lower border of the sterno-costal surface,
which is formed, in the greater part of its extent, by the
right ventricle, the left ventricle entering into its constitu-
tion only in the region of the apex. (4) A line from the
apex to the lower border of the second left costal cartilage.
This line should, be convex upwards and to the left; the
point of greatest convexity should coincide with the lower
border of the fourth left costal arch, and the upper extremity
should be situated half an inch from the left margin of the
sternum. It marks the position of the left border of the
heart, which is formed in four-fifths of its length by the left
ventricle and in the remaining fifth by the left atrium.
A line from the upper border of the sternal end of the
third left costal cartilage to the lower border of the sternal
end of the sixth right cartilage indicates the anterior part
of the coronary sulcus. The points indicating the positions
of the arterial and atrio-ventricular orifices must be placed
below and to the left of the line of the coronary sulcus in
the following order from above downwards; pulmonary orifice,

THORAX
Relations of the Extra-pulmonary Part of the Right
Bronchus.—The right bronchus is much more vertical than
the left (Fig. 48), and, as the ridge which separates the orifices
of the two bronchi at their origins, lies to the left of the
median line of the trachea, the right bronchus is the
direct continuation of the trachea, and foreign bodies, which
have entered the windpipe, pass more frequently into it than
into the left bronchus. It passes downwards and laterally
from the upper border of the fifth thoracic vertebra to the
level of the upper part of the sixth thoracic vertebra, where
it enters the hilus. Anterior to the extra-pulmonary part of
the right bronchus are the ascending part of the aorta, the
lower part of the superior vena cava, and the right pulmonary
artery. Above it is the arch of the azygos vein ; and posterior to
it are the azygos vein, the posterior pulmonary plexus, and the
right bronchial artery. This part of the right bronchus gives
off one branch, which arises close to the hilus and is called
the eparterial bronchus, because it originates immediately
above the point where the right pulmonary artery crosses
anterior to the stem bronchus.
Relations of the Extra-pulmonary Part of the Left Bronchus.
—The extra-pulmonary part of the left bronchus commences
and ends at the same level as the corresponding part of the
right bronchus, but it has further to go, because the hilus of
the left lung is further from the median plane than the
hilus of the right lung; therefore it is longer and less vertical
than the right bronchus. It gives off no branches.
Anterior to it are the left pulmonary artery, and the upper
and left part of the pericardial sac which separates the
bronchus from the left auricle. Above it is the arch of the
aorta, and posterior to it are the descending aorta, the posterior
pulmonary plexus, the left bronchial arteries, and the oeso-
phagus.
Dissection.—The intra-pulmonary parts of the bronchi and the intra-
pulmonary parts of the pulmonary arteries and veins should now be
dissected. The dissectors must commence at the hilus of the lung and
follow the bronchus and the vessels into the interior of the lung, cutting
away the lung substance, but avoiding injury to the main branches of the
bronchus and of the artery, and the main tributaries of the veins.
Relations of the Intra-pulmonary Parts of the Bronchi, the Pul-
monary Arteries and the Pulmonary Veins. —After passing through the
hilus each bronchus descends, in the substance of the lung, to the lower end
of the lung, lying nearer the medial than the lateral surface, and nearer the
posterior than the anterior border. As it descends it gives off two sets of
99
branches: (l) ventral, which run towards the anterior border of the lung,
and (2) dorsal, which pass posteriorly to the thick posterior border. As
these branches are given off below the point where the pulmonary artery
crosses anterior to the bronchus they are called hyparterial branches. The
hyparterial branches arise alternately, first a ventral and then a dorsal
branch, and, in addition, a number of small accessory branches are given
off from the stem bronchus in some of the intervals between the dorsal and
ventral branches. On the right side, the eparterial bronchus, which is given
off from the extra-pulmonary part of the right stem bronchus, supplies the
upper lobe of the right lung. The first ventral hyparterial branch supplies
the middle lobe, and all the remaining branches are distributed to the lower
lobe. On the left side, the first ventral branch goes to the upper lobe of the
left lung, and all the other branches go to the lower lobe.
The intra-pulmonary part of each pulmonary artery descends along the
postero-lateral aspect of the intra-pulmonary part of the stem bronchus,
between the ventral branches anteriorly and the dorsal branches posteriorly,
and it gives off branches which correspond with the branches of the main
bronchus.
The vein from the upper lobe, on the right side, runs along the antero-
medial aspect of the eparterial bronchus to the hilus, where it joins the
vein of the middle lobe, which lies along the antero-medial border of the
first ventral hyparterial bronchus, to form the upper right pulmonary vein.
The vein from the lower lobe ascends along the antero-medial border of
the intra-pulmonary part of the stem bronchus. On the left side, the upper
left pulmonary vein accompanies the first ventral bronchus, and the lower
accompanies the intra-pulmonary part of the stem bronchus; each vein
lies along the ventro medial aspect of the bronchus which it accompanies.
The Thoracic Portions of the Vagi Nerves.—The thoracic
parts of the vagi nerves, which are still in position, should
now be examined. Both vagi enter the thorax at the upper
aperture. The right vagus descends, through the superior
mediastinum, posterior to the right innominate vein and the
superior vena cava, passing obliquely downwards and pos-
teriorly (Fig. 12) along the side of the trachea, and between
the trachea medially, and the right pleura laterally, to the
arch of the azygos vein. Next it passes between the trachea
medially, and the arch of the azygos vein laterally, and reaches
the posterior aspect of the root of the right lung, where it breaks
up into a number of branches which unite with branches of
the sympathetic trunk to form the posterior pulmonary plexus.
It emerges from the plexus as a single trunk which runs
downwards and medially, in the posterior mediastinum, to the
front of the oesophagus. On the oesophagus it breaks up into
branches which unite with branches of the left vagus to form
the (Esophageal plexus (Fig. 47). At the lower end of the
thorax the right vagus again becomes distinct; it passes to the
posterior aspect of the oesophagus and enters the abdomen
through the oesophageal orifice of the diaphragm,

IOO
THORAX
Thoracic Branches of the Right Vagus.—Whilst the right
vagus is in the superior mediastinum it gives off a thoracic
cardiac branch, which goes to the right half of the deep
cardiac plexus, and some anterior pulmonary branches to
the front of the root of the right lung, where they join
with branches of the cardiac plexus to form the anterior pul-
monary plexus. As it passes posterior to the root of the lung
it gives branches to the bronchi and the lung; and in the
posterior mediastinum it gives branches to the oesophagus,
and to the posterior part of the pericardium and pleura.
The Left Vagus.—As the left vagus descends through the
superior mediastinum it lies at first between the left common
carotid artery and the left phrenic nerve anteriorly, and the
left subclavian artery posteriorly, and then on the left side
of the arch of the aorta. In the latter situation it is crossed
laterally by the left superior intercostal vein. Below the
lower border of the aortic arch it passes posterior to the root
of the left lung, where it breaks up into branches which enter
into the formation of the posterior pulmonary plexus. At
the lower border of the root of the left lung it emerges from
the plexus as two trunks, which descend, into the posterior
mediastinum, to the oesophagus, where they unite with
branches of the right vagus to form the oesophageal plexus.
At the lower end of the thorax the left vagus again becomes
a single trunk which passes through the oesophageal orifice
of the diaphragm on the anterior aspect of the oesophagus.
Thoracic Branches of the Left Vagus.—In the superior
mediastinum, whilst it lies against the left side of the aortic
arch, it gives off the left recurrent branch, branches to
the upper and anterior part of the pericardium, and branches
to the left anterior pulmonary plexus. Posterior to the root of
the left lung, it supplies branches to the left bronchus and
the left lung; and during its course through the posterior
mediastinum, as it takes part in the oesophageal plexus, it
gives branches to the oesophagus, to the posterior part of the
pericardium, and to the left pleura.
The Thoracic Part of the Left Recurrent Nerve.—
The left recurrent nerve springs from the trunk of the
left vagus near the lower border of the left side of the
aortic arch. It curves round the lower border of the arch,
posterior and to the left of the ligamentum arteriosum, and
passes upwards, posterior and to the right of the arch,
IOI
through the superior mediastinum, in the angle between the
left border of the trachea and the oesophagus, and posterior to
the left common carotid artery. As it turns round the arch
it gives branches to the deep cardiac plexus, and, as it ascends
along the left border of the trachea, it gives offsets to the
trachea and to the oesophagus.
The Deep Cardiac Plexus.—The deep cardiac plexus lies
between the arch of the aorta and the bifurcation of the
trachea. It is more or less distinctly separable into right and
left parts, and the right part is connected with the superficial
cardiac plexus. The right part of the plexus receives (1)
three cardiac branches from the cervical part of the right
sympathetic trunk; (2) the two cervical cardiac branches of
the right vagus; (3) the cardiac branch of the right recurrent
nerve; (4) the thoracic cardiac branch of the right vagus.
It is connected with the superficial cardiac plexus and gives
branches to (1) the right anterior pulmonary plexus; (2)
the right atrium; (3) the right coronary plexus. The left
part of the deep cardiac plexus receives (1) the middle and
lower cervical cardiac branches of the left sympathetic trunk;
(2) the upper cervical cardiac branch of the left vagus; (3)
the cardiac branches of the left recurrent nerve. It gives
branches to (1) the left anterior pulmonary plexus; (2) the
left atrium; (3) the left coronary plexus.
Dissection.—Cut through the right and left bronchi, close to their origins
from the trachea; then divide the trachea at the upper aperture of the
thorax and remove its thoracic portion, but avoid injury to the vagi and
the left recurrent nerves. The extra-pulmonary parts of the bronchi
will be retained in position by the bronchial arteries and the branches
of the pulmonary plexuses; and the thoracic part of the oesophagus will be
fully exposed.
The Thoracic Part of the (Esophagus.—The thoracic part
of the oesophagus enters the thorax at the upper aperture,
passes downwards, through the superior and posterior
mediastina, and leaves, at the level of the tenth thoracic
vertebra, by passing through the oesophageal orifice of the
diaphragm into the epigastric region of the abdomen. As it
enters the superior mediastinum it lies somewhat to the left
of the median plane, but as it descends it passes medially,
gains the median plane at the level of the fifth thoracic
vertebra, and continues downwards in that plane to the level
of the seventh thoracic vertebra. There it passes forwards
n—7 6
THORAX
and to the left, across the anterior aspect of the descending
aorta and posterior to the pericardium (Figs. 12 and 21).
Posterior Relations.—In the superior mediastinum it is an-
terior to the left longus colli muscle and the vertebral column.
In the upper part of the posterior mediastinum it is separated
from the vertebral column by (1) the posterior part of the oeso-
phageal plexus, (2) the upper six right aortic intercostal arteries,
(3) the thoracic duct, (4) the vena azygos, (5) the vena hemi-
azygos and the accessory hemiazygos vein; and in the lower part
by (6) the oesophageal plexus and (7) the descending aorta.
Anterior Relations.—Anterior to it, in the superior media-
stinum, lie the trachea, the left recurrent nerve, the upper
part of the left common carotid artery, the left subclavian
artery, the arch of the aorta, and the structures which lie
anterior to those already mentioned. As it passes from the
superior to the posterior mediastinum its anterior relations are
first the commencement of the left bronchus and then the
right pulmonary artery.1 In the posterior mediastinum, the
oesophageal plexus is on its anterior surface, intervening
between it and the posterior wall of the pericardium, which
separates both the plexus and the oesophagus from the
posterior wall of the left atrium; and at a lower level the
oesophagus lies posterior to the diaphragm (Fig. 21).
Right Lateral Relations.—In the superior mediastinum, it is
in relation with the right pleura and lung and with the arch
of the vena azygos (Figs. 12 and 22), and in the posterior
mediastinum with the oesophageal plexus and right pleura
and lung, until it passes anteriorly and to the left, anterior to
the descending aorta.
Left Lateral Relations.—In the superior mediastinum, it is
in relation on the left side with the thoracic duct, the left
subclavian artery, the left pleura and lung, and the termination
of the arch of the aorta. From the fifth to the seventh thoracic
vertebra its left lateral relations are the oesophageal plexus and
the descending aorta; and at its lower end, as it lies anterior to
the descending aorta, it comes again into relation with the
left pleura and lung.
The dissector should note (1) that, after death, the
oesophagus is somewhat compressed antero-posteriorly by
the structures between which it lies. It probably has a
similar form during life when empty and flaccid, but becomes

more circular when solids or fluids are passing along it; and
(2) that it is somewhat constricted at the level of the left
bronchus.
An inch or more of the upper part of the posterior
mediastinal portion of the tube should be removed and dis-
sected under water in a cork-lined tray. It will be found to
possess from without inwards the following coats: (1) an
external fibrous sheath; (2) a muscular coat; (3) a sub-
mucous coat; and (4) a mucous internal lining. The
submucous coat forms a loose connection between the
muscular and mucous coats; consequently, when the muscular

inferior

coat is contracted the mucous lining is thrown into longi-
tudinal folds. The muscular coat consists of an external layer
of longitudinal fibres and an internal layer of circular f1bres.
Aorta Descendens.—The descending aorta commences
at the termination of the aortic arch, at the lower border of
the left side of the fourth thoracic vertebra. It passes down-
wards, through the posterior mediastinum, and it leaves the
thorax by passing through the aortic aperture of the diaphragm,
opposite the lower border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra.
Its length is about seven inches. In the upper part of its
extent it lies to the left of the vertebral column; but in the
lower part it lies anterior to the column, in the median plane.
Branches.—Branches spring from both the anterior and the
posterior aspects of the descending aorta. Those from the
anterior aspect are the two left bronchial arteries, four
11—7 c
THORAX
oesophageal branches, and some small and irregular media-
stinal and pericardial branches. The posterior branches are
nine pairs of aortic intercostal arteries and one pair of sub-
costal arteries.
Relations.—Anterior to the thoracic part of the descending
aorta, from above downwards, are the root of the left lung;
the upper part of the posterior wall of the pericardium,
separating the aorta from the left atrium; the oesophagus,
separating the aorta from the lower part of the posterior wall
of the pericardium; and the crura of the diaphragm, which
separate the lower portion of the thoracic aorta from the

surface of the caudate lobe (O.T. Spigelian) of the liver.
Posteriorly are the vertebral column, its own intercostal and
subcostal branches, the hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos
veins ; and it is overlapped posteriorly in the upper part of its
extent by the left pleura and lung. Along its right side, in its
whole length, are the thoracic duct and the vena azygos, and
anterior to them, from the fifth to the lower part of the
seventh thoracic vertebra, lies the oesophagus. At a lower
level a mass of areolar tissue separates the aorta from the
right pleura and lung. On its left side it is in relation with
the left pleura and lung.
Dissection.—Turn the remains of the lower part of the oesophagus down-
wards towards the diaphragm. Clean the thoracic duct, the right aortic
intercostal arteries, and the hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins,
which lie posterior to the oesophagus. Then trace the thoracic duct in the

THORAX
whole of the thoracic portion of its course, and arrange with the dissector
of the head and neck to display the cervical portion of its course.
The Thoracic Duct.—The thoracic duct is a vessel of
small calibre but of great importance, for it conveys, to the
left innominate vein, the whole of the lymph from the lower
extremities, the abdomen (except that from part of the upper
surface of the liver), the left side of the thorax, including the
left lung and pleura and the left side of the heart, the left
upper extremity, and the left side of the head and neck. It
is the upward prolongation of a dilated sac, the cisterna
chyli, which lies between the right crus of the diaphragm and
the bodies of the first and second lumbar vertebrae. It
enters the thorax through the aortic orifice of the diaphragm,
lying between the aorta on the left and the vena azygos on
the right. It continues upwards through the posterior
mediastinum, lying between the descending aorta and the
vena azygos, anterior to the right aortic intercostal arteries
and the hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos veins, and
posterior to the right pleura below and the oesophagus above.
At the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra it crosses to the left
of the vertebral column, and then ascends, through the superior
mediastinum, along the left border of the oesophagus, in
contact, on the left, with the left pleural sac, and separated
posteriorly from the left longus colli muscle by the mass of
areolar tissue. Anterior to the thoracic duct, in the superior
mediastinum, are the termination of the aortic arch, the left
subclavian, and the left common carotid arteries, in that order
from below upwards. At the upper end of the thorax the
thoracic duct enters the root of the neck, and, at the level of
the seventh cervical vertebra, it turns laterally, posterior to
the left common carotid artery, the left vagus nerve, and the
left internal jugular vein, and anterior to the vertebral artery
and veins, the thyreo-cervical trunk or inferior thyreoid artery,
and the phrenic nerve. Then, turning downwards, anteriorly
and medially, on the anterior aspect of the scalenus anterior,
it crosses anterior to the transversa colli and transversa scapulae
arteries, and terminates in the upper end of the innominate
vein, in the angle of junction of its internal jugular and sub-
clavian tributaries. Immediately before its termination it
receives the left common jugular and subclavian lymphatic
trunks, unless they end separately in one or other of the
three large veins. When the thoracic duct is distended it
has a beaded or nodulated appearance on account of the
numerous valves which lie in its interior. The terminal
valve is usually situated a short distance from the point of
entrance of the duct into the left innominate vein.

The Right Lymphatic Duct.—From the point where the
thoracic duct turns from the front to the left of the
vertebral column a small lymphatic vessel, which frequently
communicates with the thoracic duct, may be traced upwards
along the front of the column to the root of the neck,
THORAX
where it ends in the commencement of the right innominate
vein. This is the right lymphatic duct. Immediately before
its termination it may be joined by the right common
jugular and right subclavian lymphatic trunks, but, as a
rule, the two latter vessels' open separately into the sub-
clavian, the internal jugular, or the innominate veins (Parsons).
The right lymphatic duct conveys lymph from the upper part
of the right lobe of the liver, the right side of the thorax,
including the right pleura and lung and the right half of the
heart, and, if it is joined by the jugular and subclavian trunks,
the lymph from the right upper extremity and the right side
of the head and neck also.
Lymphoglandulae Thoracales.—During the dissection of the thorax
the dissector will have noted certain groups of lymph glands. These
are of considerable importance, for their enlargement in disease is not
infrequently the cause of serious thoracic trouble; but whilst some, such
as the bronchial glands, are quite obvious, others are frequently so
small that they escape notice. The following are the chief groups:—(1)
Two chains of minute glands which are placed in relation to the anterior
thoracic wall and follow the course of the internal mammary vessels. They
are termed sternal lymph glands, and are joined by lymphatic vessels from
the anterior thoracic wall, the mammary glands, the anterior part of the
diaphragm, and the upper part of the anterior wall of the abdomen. (2) Two
chains of glands on the posterior thoracic wall—one on either side of the
vertebral column in relation to the vertebral extremities of the ribs. These are
very minute; afferents to them accompany the intercostal vessels; therefore
they are called the intercostal lymph glands, and they receive the lymphatics
of the posterior thoracic wall. (3) Anterior mediastinal lymph glands,
two or three in number, which receive lymphatics from the diaphragm
and upper surface of the liver. They occupy the lower open part of
the anterior mediastinum. (4) Posterior Mediastinal lytnph glands, which
follow the course of the thoracic aorta, and are joined by lymphatics
from the diaphragm, pericardium, and oesophagus. (5) Superior media-
stinal lymph glands, an important group, eight to ten in number, and
placed in relation to the aortic arch and the bifurcation of the trachea.
The lymphatics of the heart, pericardium, and thymus enter these. (6)
Bronchial lymph glands, continuous above with the preceding, and
massed chiefly in the interval between the two bronchi. They are also
prolonged into the roots of the lungs. The lymphatic vessels of the lungs
pour their contents into them. In the adult, they are generally dark in
colour, and sometimes quite black.
Dissection.—Cut through the descending aorta immediately above the
diaphragm. Detach its upper end from the left vagus and the left recurrent
nerve which were previously fastened to it, then draw it forwards and
divide the intercostal and subcostal arteries, which arise from its posterior
surface, close to their origins and remove it.
Arteris Intercostales.—There are eleven pairs of inter-
costal arteries. The upper two pairs are derived indirectly
from the subclavian arteries; the remaining nine pairs are
branches of the thoracic part of the descending aorta.
The Aortic Intercostal Arteries.—The nine pairs of aortic
intercostal arteries spring from the posterior surface of the
descending aorta, either separately or by a series of common
trunks, one for each pair. The right arteries are longer than
the left because the aorta lies to the left of the median plane;
and, since the descending aorta commences only at the level
of the lower border of the fourth thoracic vertebra, the four
or five highest pairs have to ascend to gain the level of
the spaces to which they are distributed.
The right aortic intercostal arteries run across the anterior
aspects of the bodies of the vertebrae, lying posterior to the
thoracic duct and the vena azygos; then they turn posteriorly,
between the sides of the bodies of the vertebrae and the parietal
pleura; and, finally, immediately before they enter the inter-
costal spaces, they pass between the sides of the bodies of the
vertebrae medially and the sympathetic trunk laterally. The
shorter left aortic intercostal arteries run posteriorly, first
between the left pleura and the bodies of the vertebrae, and
then between the sympathetic trunk and the vertebral bodies.
As each artery enters the space to which it belongs it gives off
a dorsal branch, which passes posteriorly, between the vertebral
column medially and the anterior costo-transverse ligament
laterally; it gives off a spinal twig, which enters the verte-
bral canal through the corresponding intervertebral foramen;
then it divides into a medial and a lateral branch which
accompany the medial and lateral divisions of the posterior
branch of the corresponding thoracic nerve. After giving off
the dorsal branch, the trunk of the artery runs laterally, along
the upper border of the space to which it belongs, at first
anterior to the posterior intercostal membrane, and then
between the internal and external intercostal muscles. Its
further course has been described already (p. 6). As it passes
along the upper border of the intercostal space, in the shelter
of the subcostal groove of the rib, it is situated between
the intercostal vein above and the anterior branch of the
thoracic nerve below.
The Subcostal Arteries.—The subcostal arteries are the
last pair of branches which spring from the posterior aspect
of the thoracic part of the descending aorta. They enter
the abdomen, by passing beneath the lateral lumbo-costal
THORAX
arches, and they run, in company with the last thoracic
nerves, along the lower borders of the last pair of ribs.
Arteriae Intercostales Supremae.—The superior intercostal
arteries, which supply the upper two intercostal spaces on
each side, are derived from the costo-cervical branches of
the subclavian arteries (Fig. 5). Each superior intercostal
artery commences at the level of the upper border of the
neck of the first rib. It descends anterior to the neck of
the rib, posterior to the parietal pleura and between the first
thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic trunk medially and
the first thoracic nerve; which is passing upwards to the
brachial plexus, laterally (Fig. 5). At the lower border of
the neck of the first rib it gives off the posterior inter-
costal artery to the first intercostal space; then it crosses
anterior to the neck of the second rib, and, turning later-
ally, it becomes the posterior intercostal artery of the second
space.
Nervi Intercostales.—The intercostal nerves are the
anterior branches of the thoracic nerves. They pass laterally
in company with the arteries. The twigs which connect
them with the sympathetic ganglia have been noted already
(p. 26). Each nerve lies at a lower level than the corre-
sponding artery, and is at first placed between the posterior
intercostal membrane and the pleura, and then between
the two muscular strata. The further course of the nerves
is described on p. 5.
The first thoracic nerve runs upwards, anterior to the neck
of the first rib, to join the brachial plexus. It gives a small
branch to the first intercostal space, but this nerve, although
it is disposed after the manner of an intercostal nerve, does
not furnish, as a rule, a lateral cutaneous or an anterior
branch. The second intercostal nerve, as a rule, sends a branch
upwards, anterior to the neck of the second rib, to join that
portion of the first thoracic nerve which enters the brachial
plexus. This communicating twig is usually minute and in-
significant, but sometimes it is a large nerve; when this is
the case, the intercosto-brachial nerve (O.T. intercosto-
humeral), or lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal
nerve, is very small or altogether absent.
Venae Intercostales.—The intercostal veins differ in their
arrangement upon the two sides of the body. On the right
side they terminate in three different ways :—
11 i
1. The intercostal vein of the first or highest space joins the right
innominate vein (sometimes the vertebral vein).
2. The intercostal veins of the second and third spaces (and sometimes
that of the fourth space) unite into a common trunk, termed the
right superior intercostal vein, which joins the upper part of the
vena azygos.
3. The intercostal veins of the lower eight spaces join the vena azygos.
On the left side of the body four modes of termination may
be recognised:—
1. The intercostal vein of the first space joins the left innominate vein
(sometimes the vertebral vein).
2. The intercostal veins of the second and third spaces (and sometimes
that of the fourth space) converge and by their union form a single
trunk, termed the left superior intercostal vein, which crosses the
arch of the aorta and joins the left innominate vein independently
of the first intercostal vein. The union with the left innominate
vein may be absent, and then the trunk formed by the veins of
the second and third spaces joins the accessory hemiazygos vein.
3. The intercostal veins of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
spaces terminate in the accessory hemiazygos vein (O.T. vena azygos
minor superior), which crosses posterior to the aorta and joins the
hemiazygos vein, or it ends directly in the vena azygos.
4. The intercostal veins of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh spaces join the
hemiazygos vein (O.T. vena azygos minor inferior).
Vena Azygos (O.T. Vena Azygos Major). — This has
already been studied, but -should now be revised (p. 29),
and then the dissector should examine the hemiazygos and
accessory hemiazygos veins.
Vena Hemiazygos Accessoria.—The accessory hemiazygos
vein is formed, on the left side of the body, by the union of the
intercostal veins of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth
spaces. It communicates above with the left superior inter-
costal vein, which carries the blood from the second and third
intercostal spaces to the left innominate vein; and it receives
the left bronchial veins. At the level of the seventh thoracic
vertebra it crosses to the right, posterior to the aorta and
thoracic duct, and ends by joining either the hemiazygos vein
or the vena azygos. In addition to the intercostal veins it
receives the left bronchial veins.
Vena Hemiazygos (O.T. Vena Azygos Minor Inferior).—
This vein takes origin within the abdomen as the left
ascending lumbar vein. It enters the thorax by piercing
the left crus of the diaphragm, and is continued upwards,
upon the vertebral column, as far as the eighth or seventh
thoracic vertebra. At this point it turns to the right, and,
THORAX
crossing posterior to the aorta and the thoracic duct,.it joins
the vena azygos. Before it terminates it may receive the
accessory hemiazygos vein.
The thoracic tributaries of this vein are the intercostal
veins of the lower three spaces of the left side and the left
subcostal vein. In the abdomen it receives the upper two
left lumbar veins.
The Anterior Intercostal Veins.—The blood is drained
from the anterior part of the thoracic wall by veins which
accompany the intercostal branches of the internal mammary
arteries. They terminate in the internal mammary veins.
The veins of the thoracic parietes are extremely variable, and the
description given above must be looked upon as representing merely their
more usual arrangement.
THORACIC JOINTS.
The dissector should now complete the dissection of the
thorax by an examination of the various thoracic joints.
Dissection. —When the portion of the sternum with the cartilages of the
ribs, which was laid aside, is studied, the following joints will be noted:
inter-sternal, costo-sternal, and inter-chondral. Very little dissection is
necessary. After the ligaments have been defined, the dissector should
remove a thin slice from the anterior aspect of each articulation, in order
that the interior of the joint may be displayed.
Synchondrosis Sternalis.—The joint between the manu-
brium and the body of the sternum is a synchondrosis. The
opposing surfaces of bone are covered with a layer of hyaline
cartilage, and are united by intermediate fibro-cartilage. The
joint is supported by some anterior and posterior longitudinal
fibres which are developed in connection with the strong and
thick periosteum. The posterior ligament is the stronger of
the two. The joint between the body of the sternum and the
xiphoid process is also a synchondrosis till middle life, at
which period the two parts become ossified together.
Sterno-chondral Articulations.—Seven ribs articulate with
each side of the sternum by means of their cartilages.
The articulations of the first and the sixth are peculiar, inasmuch as
they articulate with single pieces of the sternum, viz. with the manubrium
and the lowest piece of the body, respectively; whereas each of the cartilages
of the other true ribs articulates with two segments of the sternum. The
cartilage of the first rib is implanted upon the side of the manubrium
"3
without any synovial membrane, or other material, intervening. The
second costal cartilage is usually separated from the sternum by two
synovial cavities, between which an interarticular ligament is developed.
In the case of the other joints it is more common to find a single synovial
cavity and no interarticular ligament. There is, however, considerable
variety in these articulations, and a synovial membrane is very frequently
wanting altogether in the sterno-chondral joint of the seventh costal
cartilage.
With the exception of the first, which is a synchondrosis,
the sterno-chondral joints belong to the diarthrodial variety.
They are provided with anterior and posterior ligaments, and
also, in those cases where the joint presents a double synovial
cavity, with an interarticular ligament.
Anterior and posterior sterno-costal radiate ligaments. These
are strong, flattened bands of fibres which radiate from the
extremities of the rib-cartilages and blend with the periosteum
on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the sternum. The
interarticular ligaments are feeble bands which pass from the
tips of the rib-cartilages to the sternum, and divide the articu-
lations in which they exist into an upper and a lower com-
partment, each of which is lined with a synovial stratum.
Inter-chondral Articulations. — Interchondral joints are
formed between the adjacent margins of the ribs from the
sixth to the tenth. The joint cavities are surrounded by
ordinary capsular ligaments, each of which is lined internally
with a synovial stratum; they are, therefore, diarthrodial
joints.
Costo-vertebral Articulations.—The costo vertebral joints
are separable into two groups, capitular and costo-transverse.
The capitular articulations are the joints between the heads
of the ribs and the bodies of the vertebrae and the interverte-
bral fibro-cartilages; they are diarthrodial joints. With the
exceptions of the first and the last three ribs, the head of
every rib articulates with the bodies of two adjacent vertebrae
and the intervening intervertebral fibro-cartilage, and it is
connected with them by an articular capsule and an inter-
articular ligament. The interarticular ligament connects the
intervertebral fibro-cartilage with the ridge which separates
the two facets on the head of the rib. It is united, anteriorly
and posteriorly, with the capsule, and separates the joint cavity
into an upper and a lower compartment. The anterior part
of the. capsule is specialised into three radiating bands which
form the radiate ligament. The upper and lower bands go
VOL. II—8
THORAX
to the corresponding vertebra, whilst the intermediate band
is attached to the intervertebral fibro-cartilage. The capitular
joints of the first, and the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs are
each formed between the head of the rib and the correspond-
ing vertebra. The interarticular ligament is absent; therefore
each joint possesses only one cavity. The anterior parts of
the capsules of these joints are not, as a rule, specialised into
radiate bands.
The Costo-transverse Articulations are the joints formed
Anterior longitudinal ligament

F1g. 54.—Anterior aspect of the Costo-vertebral Joints; also Anterior
Longitudinal Ligament of Vertebral Column.
between the necks and the tubercles of the ribs and the trans-
verse processes of the vertebrae.
The tubercle of each rib, with the exception of the
eleventh and twelfth, articulates with the tip of the transverse
process of the vertebra of the same number, by a circular
articular facet which is surrounded by an articular capsule
lined with a stratum synoviale. The joint is, therefore, a diar-
throdial joint and the upper and posterior part of the capsule
is greatly thickened, and is called the ligament of the tubercle
(O.T. posterior costo-transverse ligament). In addition to the
capsule and its posterior thickening there are three accessory
"5
costo-transverse bands, the anterior and posterior costo-trans-
verse ligaments and the ligament of the neck of the rib.
The anterior costo - transverse ligament ascends from the
anterior margin of the upper border of the neck of the rib
to the lower border of the transverse process above. The
posterior costo-transverse ligament passes upwards from the
posterior part of the upper border of the neck of the rib to
the junction of the lamina and the transverse process of
the vertebra above; and the ligament of the neck of the rib
(O.T. middle costo-transverse ligament) connects the posterior
aspect of the neck of the rib with the anterior aspect of the
transverse process of the vertebra of the same number.
In the case of the eleventh rib the costo-transverse liga-
ments are rudimentary or absent, and in the case of the
twelfth rib they are usually entirely absent.
Intervertebral Articulations.—The bodies of the vertebrae
are held together by a series of synchondrodial joints, sup-
ported anteriorly by an anterior longitudinal ligament, and
posteriorly by a posterior longitudinal ligament. The vertebral
arches, by means of the articular processes, form a series of
diarthrodial joints surrounded by capsular ligaments, each
capsule being lined with a synovial stratum. Certain ligaments
pass between different portions of the vertebral arches and their
processes, viz., the ligamenta flava between adjacent laminae,
the inter-transverse, the inter-spinous, and the supra-spinous
ligaments.
The laminae and the spinous processes of the vertebrae have been
removed by the dissector of the head and neck in opening up the vertebral
canal to display the spinal medulla. Consequently, the ligamenta flava,
the inter-spinous and supra-spinous ligaments, cannot be seen at present.
The anterior longitudinal ligament (O.T. anterior common
ligament) is situated anterior to the bodies of the vertebrae,
and extends from the atlas vertebra above to the first piece
of the sacrum below. It consists of stout glistening fibrous
bands, which are firmly attached to the margins of the verte-
bral bodies and to the intervertebral fibro-cartilages. The
most superf1cial fibres are the longest, and extend from a
given vertebra to the fourth or fifth below it. The deeper
fibres have a shorter course, and pass between the borders
of two, three, or four adjacent vertebrae. The dissector
cannot fail to notice that the origin of the longus colli muscle
is inseparably connected with this ligament.
n—8 a
THORAX
The posterior longitudinal ligament (O.T. posterior common
ligament) is placed on the posterior aspects of the vertebral
bodies, and therefore within the vertebral canal. It is firmly
connected to the margins of the vertebral bodies and to the
intervertebral fibro-cartilages, but is separated from the central
parts of the bodies by some loose connective tissue and by a
plexus of veins. It is constricted where it covers this venous
plexus, but widens out opposite the fibro-cartilages. It there-
fore presents a scalloped or
denticulated appearance.
The intervertebral fibro-
cartilages are a series of
discs of white fibro-car-
tilage, thicker anteriorly
than posteriorly, which are
interposed between the
bodies of adjacent vertebrae.
The peripheral part of each
disc, annulus fibrosus, is
tough and fibrous; the
central portion, nucleus
pulposus, is soft and pulpy.
The discs increase the
elasticity of the spine,
and tend to restore it to
its natural curvature after
it has been deflected by
muscular action.
The intervertebral
fibro - cartilages constitute
the main bond of union
between the bodies of the vertebrae, but, except in old people,
they are not directly attached to the bone. A thin layer of en-
crusting hyaline cartilage coats the opposing vertebral surfaces.
Vertical and horizontal sections must be made through two or more of
the fibro-cartilages, in order that their structure may be displayed.
The intertransverse ligaments are feeble bands which pass
between the tips of the transverse processes. In the lower
part of the thoracic region they are intimately blended with
the intertransverse muscles: in- the middle and upper parts
of the thoracic region they entirely replace the muscles.

ment of the Vertebral Column. The

FACE AND FRONTAL REGION OF HEAD 117
HEAD AND NECK.
The dissectors of the Head and Neck begin work as soon
as the subject is brought into the room. During the first
three days, whilst the body is in the lithotomy posture, they
dissect the face, the anterior part of the eyelids, the superficial
part of the nose, and the anterior part of the scalp. During
the following five days, when the body is lying on its back,
they dissect the posterior triangle, and complete the dissection
of the scalp.
It is only by dissecting the face at this period, whilst
the parts are in good condition, that the dissector can
gain any satisfactory idea of its component parts; and it is
essential that the contents of the posterior triangle, which
is such an important surgical region, should be displayed
before the dissector of the arm has disturbed its posterior
boundary.
The first day should be devoted to the examination of the anterior part
of the frontal region of the head and the face, the study of the surface
anatomy of the ocular appendages, the reflection of the skin, and the clean-
ing of the superficial muscles of the face and anterior part of the scalp.
On the second day the dissectors should display the superficial surface of
the parotid gland; they should also find and clean the superficial vessels
and nerves, and trace them to their terminations. On the third day the
superficial muscles must be reflected, and the deeper vessels and nerves
must be exposed and cleaned, and the auricle should be examined and
dissected. On the fourth day, when the body has been placed upon its
back, the dissectors should commence the dissection of the posterior
triangle of the neck, and should complete that part of the dissection in
three days. On the seventh day they should complete the examination
of the scalp. The eighth day should be devoted to a final study of the
brachial plexus in association with the dissectors of the upper extremity.
FACE AND FRONTAL REGION OF HEAD.
The dissectors should commence the study of the face and
frontal region by an examination of the bony prominences
and ridges in the area to be dissected.
In the centre of the facial area is the prominent outer
portion of the nose, consisting of a lower mobile part formed
mainly by skin and cartilage, and an upper rigid portion
formed by the nasal bones and the frontal processes of
HEAD AND NECK
the maxillae. On either side of the nose are the sockets
for the eyeballs, each of which is bounded above by the
supra-orbital margin of the frontal bone and below by the
orbital margins of the maxilla and the zygomatic bone
(O.T. malar). The supra- and infra-orbital margins meet
laterally in the region of the cheek bone (zygomatic). From
the posterior part of the zygomatic bone, the zygomatic
arch, formed partly by the zygomatic and partly by the
temporal bone, extends posteriorly to the ear. Above the
zygomatic arch is the region of the temporal fossa, which
is bounded superiorly by the temporal line. The line
terminates anteriorly in the lateral part of the supra-orbital
margin. Above the medial part of the supra-orbital margin
the superciliary arch can be felt, and at a higher level,
above the lateral part of the supra-orbital margin, lies the
frontal tuber. The region above the nose and between
the medial ends of the superciliary arches is the glabella.
Below the zygomatic arch lies the ramus of the mandible
covered by the masseter muscle; and extending anteriorly
from the lower end of the ramus is the body of the mandible.
A line dropped vertically through the junction of the medial
third with the lateral two-thirds of the supra-orbital margin,
will cut through the supra-orbital notch of the frontal bone,
the infra-orbital foramen of the maxilla, and the mental foramen
of the mandible, all three of which may be felt if firm pressure
is made in the proper situations. The first, which lies in the
supra-orbital margin, transmits the supra-orbital vessels and
nerve. The second is placed about half an inch below the
infra-orbital margin. It transmits the infra-orbital vessels and
nerve. The third lies midway between the second premolar
tooth of the mandible and the lower border of the mandible;
it transmits the mental branches of the inferior alveolar vessels
and nerve.
After the bony points of the region have been studied,
the surface anatomy of the ocular appendages should be
examined. Under this head are included (1) the eyebrows;
(2) the eyelids; (3) the conjunctiva.
The eyebrows are two curved tegumentary projections
placed over the supra-orbital arch of the frontal bone; they
intervene between the forehead above and the ocular regions
below. The short stiff hairs which spring from the eyebrows
have a lateral inclination,
The eyelids (palpebrae) are the semilunar curtains provided
for the protection of each eyeball. The upper lid is the
longer and much the more movable of the two. When the
eye is open, the margins of the two lids are slightly concave
and the interval between them, rima palpebrarum, is elliptical
in outline. When the eye is closed, and the margins of the
lids are in apposition, the rima palpebrarum is reduced to a

nearly horizontal line. Owing to the greater length and
mobility of the upper lid, the rima, in this condition, is placed
below the level of the cornea or clear part of the eyeball.
At the extremities of the rima palpebrarum the eyelids
meet and form the palpebral commissures, and immediately
lateral to the medial commissure the rima expands into a
small triangular space called the lacus lacrimalis. If the
dissector now examines the free margins of the lids he will
note that to the lateral side of the lacus lacrimalis they

HEAD AND NECK
are flat, and that in each case the eyelashes project from
the anterior border, whilst the tarsal glands open along the
posterior border, a distinct interval intervening between the
cilia and the mouths of the glands. On the other hand,
the small portion of the margin of each eyelid which bounds
the lacus lacrimalis is more horizontal in direction, somewhat
rounded, and destitute both of eyelashes and of tarsal glands.
At the very point where the eyelashes in each eyelid cease,
and the palpebral margin becomes rounded, a minute emi-
nence with a central perforation will be seen. The eminence
is the papilla lacrimalis, whilst the perforation, called the
punctum lacrimale, is the mouth of the lacrimal duct, which
conveys away the tears. Endeavour to pass a bristle into
each of the orifices. The upper duct at first ascends, whilst
the lower one descends, and then both run horizontally to the
lacrimal sac.
The conjunctiva is the membrane which lines the deep
surfaces of the lids, and is reflected from them on to the
anterior aspect of the eyeball. At the margins of the lids it
is continuous with the skin, whilst, through the puncta lacri-
malia and the lacrimal ducts, it becomes continuous with
the lining membrane of the lacrimal sac. The line of re-
flection of the conjunctiva from the lids on to the eyeball is
termed the fornix conjunctiva. Owing to the greater depth of
the upper lid, the conjunctival recess between the upper lid
and the eyeball is of greater extent than that of the lower lid.
The conjunctiva is loosely connected with the eyelids on the
one hand, and with the sclera of the eyeball on the other.
Over the cornea the membrane becomes thinned down to a
mere epithelial covering, which is closely adherent.
In connection with the conjunctiva, the plica semilunaris
and the caruncula lacrimalis must be examined. The
caruncula is the reddish fleshy-looking elevation which
occupies the centre of the lacus lacrimalis. From its surface
a few minute hairs project. The plica semilunaris is of interest
because in the human eye it is the rudimentary representative
of the membrana nictitans, or third eyelid, found in many
animals. It is a small vertical fold of conjunctiva, which is
placed immediately to the lateral side of the caruncula, and it
slightly overlaps the eyeball at this point.
Dissection.—Distend the eyelids slightly by placing a little tow or cotton
wool steeped in preservative solution in the conjunctival sac; then stitch
the margins of the lids together. Distend the cheeks and lips slightly by
placing tow or cotton wool steeped in preservative solution in the vestibule
of the mouth—that is, between the cheeks and lips externally and the teeth
and gums internally; then stitch the red margins of the lips together.
Reflect the skin by means of three incisions, a median longitudinal and
two transverse. Commence the median incision midway between the root
of the nose and the external occipital protuberance, carry it anteriorly to the
forehead and then downwards along the median line of the forehead, the
nose and the lips, to the tip of the chin. Commence the upper horizontal
incision at the level of the rima palpebrarum; carry it laterally from the
longitudinal incision to the medial commissure, then round the margins of
the rima to the lateral commissure, and, finally, posteriorly to the ear. The
lower horizontal incision should run from the angle of the mouth to the
posterior border of the ramus of the mandible. Reflect the upper and
middle flaps and leave them attached posteriorly. Reflect the lower flap
downwards to the lower border of the mandible. Note, whilst reflecting
the skin, that many of the superficial fibres of the facial muscles are
implanted into its deep surface. It is these fibres which tend to displace
the margins of wounds of the face, and necessitate the application of
numerous and firmly tied sutures in order to secure quick and accurate
union. Whilst reflecting the skin the dissector must be careful to keep his
knife playing against its deep surface ; otherwise he is certain to injure the
sphincter muscle of the eyelids, and the superficial extrinsic muscles of the
ear which lie in the temporal region.
After the skin is reflected the superficial muscles must be
cleaned. That which will first attract attention is the orbicu-
laris oculi around the orbit. Above the orbicularis oculi is the
frontalis belly of the epicranial muscle. To the medial side
of the orbicularis oculi lie the muscles of the nose, and below
it the muscles of the upper lip pass downwards to the
orbicularis oris. Passing anteriorly and upwards, over the
posterior part of the lower border of the mandible, are the
upper and posterior fibres of the platysma, and more medially
are the muscles of the lower lip.
Commence with the Orbicularis Oculi (O.T. Orbicularis
Palpebrarum).—Pull the eyelids laterally and note a prominent
cord-like band which extends from the frontal process of the
maxilla to the medial commissure, where it becomes continuous
with both eyelids; this is the medial palpebral ligament
(O.T. internal tarsal ligament). A somewhat similar band, the
lateral palpebral raphe (O.T. external tarsal ligament), extends
from the lateral commissure to the zygomatic bone. After
the medial palpebral ligament has been recognised, clean first
the thicker orbital part of the orbicularis oculi, which covers
the superficial bony boundaries of the orbit, and then the
thinner palpebral portion, which lies in the eyelids. The
palpebral part is not only thin but also pale, and its fibres, in
HEAD AND NECK
each eyelid, sweep in gentle curves from the medial palpebral
ligament to the lateral palpebral raphe, gaining attachment to
both. They form a continuous layer of uniform thickness in
each eyelid, except near the free margins, where, close to the
bases of the eyelashes, there is a more pronounced fasciculus
termed the ciliary bundle.
The orbital portion of the muscle passes upwards to the
forehead, laterally to the temporal region and downwards into
the cheek. Its fibres are relatively dark and coarse. They
all take origin medially from the medial part of the palpebral
ligament, the medial angular process of the frontal bone, and
the frontal process of the maxilla, and they sweep laterally
round the margin of the orbit in the form of a series of con-
centric loops. The pars lacrimalis of the orbicularis oculi
(O.T. tensor tarsi) will be described when the eyelids are
dissected (p. 140).
Musculus Epicranius (O.T. Occipito - Frontalis).—The
epicranius is a quadricipital muscle possessing two occipital
heads, the occipitales muscles, and two frontal heads, the
frontales muscles; they are all inserted into an intermediate
aponeurosis, the galea aponeurotica (O.T. epicranial aponeur-
osis), which extends from the frontal to the occipital region
(p. 158). The lower part of each frontal head blends with the
orbicularis oculi, and from its medial border a small muscular
bundle, known as the musculus procerus (O.T. pyramidalis
nasi), descends to the dorsum of the nose. At present only
the frontalis and the procerus are to be displayed.
The Frontalis becomes apparent immediately above the
upper border of the orbicularis oculi. As it is cleaned care
should be taken to avoid injury to the branches of the supra-
orbital nerve which pierce it. It has little or no attachment
to bone. Below, its fibres either blend with the fibres of the
orbicularis oculi or they are attached to the skin of the eye-
brows. Above, they terminate in the galea aponeurotica in the
region of the coronal suture. The lateral border is attached
to the temporal ridge by aponeurotic fibres, and the medial
border blends with its fellow of the opposite side for a short
distance above the root of the nose. Above the union the
medial fibres of opposite sides diverge, and below it they pass
downwards over the nasal bones as the proceral muscles.
Musculus Procerus (O.T. Pyramidalis Nasi).—The proceral
muscles are often absent; when present, each springs from
the lower and medial part of the corresponding frontalis.
It descends over the nasal bone and ends on the dorsum
of the nose, where some of its fibres blend with the trans-
verse part of the nasalis and others are inserted into the skin.
Along the lower and medial border of the orbicularis oculi
will be found the muscles of the nose and the upper lip.
The proper muscles of the nose are the musculus nasalis
and the musculus depressor septi, but the procerus may also
be looked upon as partly a nasal muscle, and the angular
head of the quadratus labii superioris has a nasal attachment.
Musculus Nasalis.—The musculus nasalis consists of two
parts, the pars transversa (O.T. compressor naris), and the
pars alaris (O.T. dilator naris). The pars transversa springs
from the root of the frontal process of the maxilla, passes
across the cartilaginous part of the nose, above the ala, and
ends in an aponeurosis which connects it with its fellow of
the opposite side. The pars alaris springs from the maxilla,
at the side of the lower part of the anterior nasal aperture,
and it terminates in the posterior part of the ala and the
mobile part of the septum of the nose. The nasalis is partly
concealed by the medial fibres of the quadratus labii superioris.
Musculus Depressor Septi Nasi.—This small muscle is
frequently difficult to display. It springs from the superf1cial
fibres of the upper part of the orbicularis oris, and is inserted
into the anterior part of the septum of the nose. It depresses
the septum and reduces the antero posterior diameter of the
anterior nasal aperture.
After the muscles of the nose have been examined clean
the superficial muscles of the mouth and cheek.
The Muscles of the Mouth and Cheeks.—The muscles of
this group form two layers, a superficial and a deep. Those
of the superficial group are the orbicularis oris, quadratus
labii superioris, zygomaticus, triangularis, risorius, quadratus
labii inferioris; those of the deeper group are the buccinator,
caninus, incisivi and mentalis. All, with the exception of the
orbicularis oris, are bilateral. The members of the superficial
group must be examined first; the deeper muscles will be
displayed after the superficial vessels and nerves have been
dissected.
Orbicularis Oris.—The orbicularis oris is the sphincter
muscle of the oral aperture. It lies in the substance of the
lips, and consists of a deeper layer of fibres which are arranged
HEAD AND NECK
in concentric ellipsoidal rings, and a series of superficial fibres
into which all the other muscles of the lips and cheeks con-
verge. The details of its formation cannot be understood
until the attachments of the other muscles have been studied.

F1g. 57.—The Facial Muscles.
Musculus Quadratus Labii Superioris.—The quadratus
labii superioris possesses three heads—a zygomatic, an infra-
orbital, and an angular. As the muscle is cleaned the
dissector should secure the upper part of the anterior facial
vein, which crosses its superficial surface.
The zygomatic head (O.T. zygomaticus minor) springs
from the anterior part of the facial surface of the zygomatic
bone, under cover of the lower lateral part of the orbicularis
oculi. It runs downwards and anteriorly, and is inserted into
the lateral part of the upper portion of the orbicularis oris
and into the adjacent part of the skin of the upper lip.
TTte Infra-orbital Head (O.T. Levator Labii Superioris
Proprius).—This head springs from the whole length of the
infra-orbital border, under cover of the orbicularis oculi. It
is inserted into the upper lateral part of the orbicularis oris
and the skin of the upper lip.
The angular head (O.T. levator labii superioris alaque
nasi) springs from the frontal process of the maxilla. It
broadens as it descends, and it is inserted into the ala of the
nose and into the upper part of the orbicularis oris.
Musculus Zygomaticus.—The zygomaticus (O.T. zygo-
maticus major) is a comparatively long, slender muscular
band which springs from the facial surface of the zygomatic
bone, under cover of the lower lateral fibres of the orbicularis
oculi and to the lateral side of the zygomatic head of the
quadratus labii superioris. Its fibres pass downwards and
medially to the angle of the mouth, where some blend with
the orbicularis oris and others are inserted into the skin.
The Risorius.—This muscle, when well developed, consists
partly of some of the uppermost fibres of the platysma muscle
of the neck, which bend anteriorly to the angle of the mouth,
and partly of additional fibres which spring from the fascia
over the masseter muscle and the parotid gland. Both
groups of fibres blend with the fibres of the orbicularis oris
at the angle of the mouth.
Musculus Triangularis.—The triangularis (O.T. depressor
ang'uli oris) springs from the oblique line on the lateral surface
of the body of the mandible. Its fibres converge as they
pass anteriorly and upwards, and, at the angle of the mouth,
they blend with the orbicularis oris, in which some of them
curve past the angle and terminate in the substance of the
upper lip (Figs. 57, 58).
Musculus Quadratus Labii Inferioris (O.T. Depressor Labii
Inferioris).—This muscle springs from the lower part of the
superficial surface of the mandible, between the mental
tubercle and the mental foramen, its posterior border being
overlapped by the triangularis. The fibres pass upwards

and medially, some to blend with the orbicularis oris and
others to gain attachment to the skin of the lower lip.
Platysma.—Only the upper part of the broad, flat,
quadrangular subcutaneous muscle of the neck is at present
visible. The posterior fibres ascend over the lower border
of the ramus and the posterior part of the lower border of
the body of the mandible, and they have already been seen
taking part in the formation of the risorius. The anterior
flbres gain direct insertion into the anterior part of the lower

border of the body of the mandible. The latter attach-
ment is the only bony attachment which the muscle possesses,
all its other attachments being either to fascia or to skin.
Dissection.—Cut through the posterior half of the platysma along the
lower border of the mandible; detach the risorius from the fascia on
the masseter; then turn the risorius and the detached part of the platysma
towards the angle of the mouth. Whilst doing this be careful to avoid
injuring the branches of the vessels and nerves of the face.
As soon as the platysma and the risorius are reflected search below the level
of the ear for branches of the great auricular nerve which ascend over the
lower part of the parotid gland. Some of them pierce the parotid and
terminate in its substance, others end in the skin of the masseteric region.
Find the anterior facial vein and the external maxillary artery at the
lower and anterior angle of the masseter as they cross the lower border of
the mandible. Clean them at this point, but do not trace them towards
their terminations at present.
At the posterior border of the mandible note the fascia over the super-
ficial surface of the parotid gland. It ascends from the fascia of the neck,
and is attached above to the zygomatic arch. Note also that at the anterior
border of the parotid this fascia blends with the fascia on the superficial
surface of the masseter muscle. Cut through the fascia covering the
parotid gland immediately anterior to the ear, extending the incision from
the zygoma above to the angle of the mandible below; then raise the
fascia from the gland, dissecting carefully anteriorly, upwards, and down-
wards. As the extremities and the anterior border of the gland are
approached, look carefully for nerves and vessels which emerge from
beneath them, and also for the duct of the gland, which appears from
under cover of the anterior border about a finger's breadth below the
zygoma. The duct has thick walls, is of considerable size, and is easily re-
cognised. It runs anteriorly across the masseter and turns round the anterior
border of the muscle, bending at right angles to its original course. It
pierces, in turn, the fascia covering the buccinator muscle, the buccinator
muscle itself and the mucous membrane of the mouth; and it opens into
the vestibule of the mouth, on a small papilla opposite the second molar
tooth of the maxilla. Above the duct and below the zygomatic arch find
(1) the accessory parotid, a small detached part of the parotid which
lies a short distance anterior to the anterior border of the main mass
of the gland; (2) the transverse facial vessels; and (3) the zygomatic
branches of the facial nerve. Below the duct find the buccal and the
mandibular branches of the facial nerve. At the upper end of the parotid
seek for the superficial temporal vessels. Posterior to them lies the auriculo-
temporal branch of the third division of the trigeminal nerve, and an-
terior to them, the temporal branches of the facial nerve. From, or from
beneath, the lower extremity of the gland emerge (1) the cervical branch of
the facial nerve, (2) the posterior facial vein (O.T. anterior division of the
temporo-maxillary vein), and (3) the external jugular vein.
The Terminal Branches of the Facial Nerve.—The dis-
sector should note that there are five terminal branches, or
groups of branches, of the facial nerve: (1) temporal; (2)
zygomatic; (3) buccal; (4) mandibular; (5) cervical. They
all emerge from under cover of the parotid gland, the
temporal branches at its upper end, the cervical at its lower
end, and the remaining three groups of branches at its
anterior border. The temporal branches will be followed
when the temporal region and the scalp are being dissected,
and the cervical branch when the anterior triangle of the neck
is displayed; but the remaining three groups of branches
should now be followed to their terminations.
The upper filaments of the zygomatic branch or branches run
anteriorly, across the zygomatic bone, and terminate, in both
the upper and the lower eyelid, in the fibres of the orbi-
cularis oculi. If the branches are carefully traced, one of
them will be found to communicate with the zygomatico-

facial branch of the second or maxillary division of the fifth
nerve. This small nerve pierces the zygomatic bone a short
distance below the lateral border of the orbit.
The lower filaments are larger. They run anteriorly along

quadratus labii superioris, and deep to the latter they com-
municate with the infra-orbital branch of the maxillary division
of the fifth nerve, forming with it the infra-orbitalplexus.
The buccal branch or branches run towards the angle of
the mouth. At the anterior border of the masseter they com-
municate, around the anterior facial vein, with the buccinator
branch (O.T. .long buccal) of the third division of the fifth,
and they supply the buccinator and the orbicularis oris.
Dissection.—In order to trace the branches to their terminations and to
display fully the infra-orbital plexus, cut through the musculus zygomaticus
and the quadratus labii superioris immediately below their origins, and
turn them downwards towards the upper lip. When this has been done,
clear away the fatty tissue which lies on the deep aspect of the quadratus
labii superioris and secure the infra-orbital vessels and nerve, as they emerge
from the infra-orbital foramen. The infra-orbital plexus lies deep to the
quadratus labii superioris, and on the superficial aspect of the musculus
caninus. From the plexus three groups of branches are distributed: (1)
palpebral, which pass upwards to the lower eyelid; (2) nasal, which run
medially to the nose; and (3) labial, which descend to the upper lip. Either
by means of these branches, or more directly, the lower zygomatic twigs
of the facial nerve are distributed to the musculus zygomaticus, the muscles
of the lower eyelid, muscles of the nose, and the muscles of the upper lip.
The mandibular branch or branches run anteriorly along the
mandible to be distributed to the muscles of the lower lip.
As they pass anteriorly they lie deep to the triangularis, and
they communicate, under cover of it, with the mental branch
of the inferior alveolar (O.T. dental) nerve. To display this
communication the triangularis must be reflected, and the
mental vessels and nerves must be found as they emerge
from the mental foramen.
Arteria Maxillaris Externa (O.T. Facial).—The ex-
ternal maxillary artery is a tortuous vessel which enters the
face at the lower and anterior angle of the masseter, after
turning round the lower border of the mandible" an3 piercing
the deep fascia of the neck. From that point it runs
anteriorly and upwards to the angle of the mouth and then,
assuming a more vertical direction, it is prolonged upwards,
as the angular artery, to the medial commissure of the
eyelids, in the substance of the angular head of the quadratus
labii superioris. Immediately after its entrance into the face
it is comparatively superficial, being covered by skin, super-
ficial fascia, and platysma, and it is easily compressed against
the bone. More anteriorly it lies between the zygomaticus
superficially and the buccinator deeply, then between the
quadratus labii superioris and the caninus, and, as already
stated, its terminal part is usually embedded in the substance
of the quadratus labii superioris.
Branches.—The branches of the external maxillary artery
form two groups, a posterior and an anterior. The branches
of the posterior group pass posteriorly and are of small size.
They are distributed to the masseteric, buccal, and malar
regions where they anastomose w1tTTthe transverse facial,"The
buccinator, and the infra-orbital arteries.
The branches of the anterior group run anteriorly and re-

median plane, under cover of the triangularis, the quadratus
labii inferioris, and the orbicularis oris. In the substance of
the lip it lies immediately adjacent to the mucous membrane,
and it anastomoses in the median plane with its fellow of the
opposite side.
The superior labial arises about the level of the angle
of the mouth and runs medially in the upper lip, between
the orbicularis oris and the mucous membrane. Before it
anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, it gives off
a branch, the septal artery of the nose, which passes upwards
and ramifies on the lower and anterior part of the nasal septum,
where it anastomoses with the septal branch of the spheno-
palatine artery.
The Angular Artery.—This is the continuation of the
external maxillary beyond the point of origin of the lateral
nasal branch. It runs upwards in the substance of the
angular head of the quadratus labii superioris, and it
terminates at the medial commissure of the eye by anastomos-
ing with the nasal branch of the ophthalmic. The lateral
nasal branch springs from the external maxillary at the point
where it becomes the angular. It ramifies on the side of the
nose and anastomoses in the median plane with its fellow of
the opposite side.
In addition to the branches already noted, a very definite
branch is usually given off from the anterior aspect of the
external maxillary artery immediately after it crosses the
lower border of the mandible. This branch (O.T. inferior
labial) runs towards the median plane under cover of the
triangularis and the depressor labii inferioris, and it anasto-
moses not only with the inferior labial (O.T. inferior coronary)
above, and its fellow of the opposite side in the median plane,
but also with the mental branch of the inferior alveolar artery.
Vena Facialis Anterior (O.T. Facial).—The anterior
facial vein is a less tortuous vessel than the external maxillary
artery to which it corresponds, and it lies posterior, and on
a slightly more superficial plane. It commences as the
angular vein, which is formed at the medial commissure
of the eyelids, by the union of the frontal and supra-orbital
veins, which descend from the forehead. It passes down-
wards and posteriorly, in a comparatively straight line, to the
anterior inferior angle of the masseter, which it crosses
immediately behind the external maxillary artery; then it
pierces the deep fascia of the neck, and enters the sub-
maxillary triangle. In the upper part of the face it lies on
the quadratus labii superioris; then it is situated between the
zygomaticus and the risorius superficially and the buccinator
deeply; and as it crosses the anterior angle of the masseter
it is covered with the skin, superficial fascia, and the platysma.
II—9o
HEAD AND NECK
Tributaries.—In addition to the frontal and supra-orbital
veins, it receives external nasal, palpebral, superior labial,
inferior labial, masseteric and superficial parotid tributaries.
As it crosses the buccinator muscle it is joined by the deep
facial vein, which connects it with the pterygoid plexus of
veins in the infra-temporal region.
Dissection.—After the branches of the facial nerve, the external maxillary
artery and the anterior facial vein have been studied, the dissection of the
deeper muscles and the deeper vessels and nerves must be proceeded with;
but the supra-orbital and supra-trochlear nerves, the supra-orbital vessels,
and the corrugator supercilii muscle may be left till the scalp is dissected
(p. 156).
Musculus Caninus (O.T. Levator Anguli Oris). — The
caninus is concealed by the lower part of the orbicularis
oculi, the quadratus labii superioris, and the zygomaticus, and
it is crossed superficially, near the angle of the mouth, by
the external maxillary artery. When the structures superficial
to it are turned aside, the muscle will be found springing from
the canine fossa below the infra-orbital foramen. It passes
downwards to the angle of the mouth, where it blends with the
orbicularis oris, some of its fibres passing into the lower lip
(Fig. 57). It is an elevator of the angle of the mouth. \J
The Buccinator. —. This muscle occupies the interval
between the upper and the lower jaws and forms a most
important part of the substance of the cheek. Above, it
springs from the alveolar border of the maxilla, in the
region of the molar teeth. Below, it arises from the
alveolar border of the mandible, also in the region of the
molar teeth, and, posteriorly, it is attached to the pterygo-
mandibular raphe, which forms a bond of union between
the "bu€cinater"a-nd the superior constrictor of the pharynx.
This attachment will be seen to better advantage when the
wall of the pharynx is studied (p. 373). Anteriorly, its fibres
converge towards the angle of the mouth, where they blend
with the orbicularis oris, of which they form a large part.
The manner in which the fibres enter the orbicularis must be
carefully noted. The upper and lower fibres pass directly
to the corresponding lips; the middle fibres, on the other
hand, decussate at the angle of the mouth, so that the lower
fibres of the series enter the upper lip, whilst the higher
fasciculi reach the lower lip (Fig. 61).
The Molar Glands.—The buccinator is covered posteriorly
by a pad of fat, the suctorial pad, and by a strong layer of
fascia which must be carefully removed. As this is being
done the dissector will find, both superficial and deep to
the fascia, a number of small glands, the molar salivary
glands. The ducts of these glands pierce the buccinator and
open into the vestibule of the mouth. One or two buccal
lymph glands also are sometimes found resting on the super-
ficial surface of the buccinator.
Dissection.—After the dissection of the buccinator and the molar glands
is completed, remove the stitches from the lips; evert the lips and dissect
the mucous membrane from the deep surfaces, in order to expose the
muscular slips which attach the orbicularis oris to the alveolar margins of the
upper and the lower jaws, and to display the mentalis muscle. As the lips
are everted the dissector should note that a fold of mucous membrane, the
frenulum labii, passes from each lip to the gum of the corresponding jaw in

the median plane; and as the mucous membrane is removed a number-'of
small labial salivary glands, which lie in the submucous tissue, will be
seen. They are readily felt in the living subject by pressing the tip of the
tongue against the inner surfaces of the lips.
Musculi Incisivi Labii Superioris et Inferioris.—These
are four small muscular bundles, two upper and two lower,
which attach the deeper part of the orbicularis oris to the
alveolar margins of the jaws in the regions of the upper and
lower lateral incisor teeth.
Musculus Mentalis.—When the incisive muscles of the
lower jaw are detached from the bone and the lower lip
is further everted, a distinct muscular bundle will be found on
each side, springing from the outer surface of the socket of the
canine tooth, under cover of the quadratus labii inferioris.
The two bundles converge and blend together, between the
medial borders of the musculi quadrati labii inferioris, to
form a single bundle which is inserted into the skin of the
chin. It is an elevator of the skin of the chin.

HEAD AND NECK
Nervus Buccinatoriua (O.T. Long Buccal).—This nerve is
a branch of the third division of the trigeminal nerve. It
passes anteriorly into the cheek from under cover of the
ramus of the mandible. It is a sensory nerve, and it supplies
branches to the skin on the outer surface and the mucous
membrane on the inner surface of the buccinator muscle.
In order to display it at the present stage it may be necessary
to make an antero-posterior incision through the middle of
the anterior border of the masseter.

eyelid as the dissection is carried from the surface towards
the conjunctiva.

In addition to these structures, two ligamentous bands,
named the medial palpebral ligament (O.T. internal tarsal
ligament) and the lateral palpebral raphe (O.T. external
tarsal ligament), will be noticed. They attach the tarsi to
the medial and lateral margins of the orbit.
Integument and Orbicularis Oculi.—These strata have
been examined already, and the skin has been reflected.
Dissection.—Separate the palpebral part of the orbicularis oculi from the
remainder by a circular incision; turn the palpebral part towards the
rima palpebrarum, and take care, whilst raising the muscle fibres, to preserve
the palpebral vessels and nerves, and at the same time to avoid injury to
the palpebral fascia. As the dissection is completed the origin of the
muscle from the medial palpebral ligament (p. 121) will be displayed.
Tarsi.—The removal of the palpebral part of the orbicularis
oculi brings into view the palpebral fascia and the tarsi.
These lie in the same morphological plane, and they constitute
the ground-work of the eyelids.
The tarsi are two thin plates of condensed fibrous tissue,
placed one in each eyelid so as to occupy an area immediately
adjoining its free margin. They differ very materially from
each other. The superior tarsal plate is much the larger of
the two, and presents the figure of a half oval. Its deep
surface is intimately connected with the subjacent conjunctiva,
whilst its superficial surface is clothed by the orbicularis muscle,
and is in relation to the roots of the eyelashes. Its superior
border is thin, convex, and continuous with a tendinous
expansion of the levator palpebrae superioris. The inferior
border of the tarsal plate is thickened and straight, and the
integument adheres firmly to it.
The inferior tarsal plate is a narrow strip which is similarly
placed in the lower lid.
Glandulae Tarsales (O.T. Meibomian Follicles).—At this
stage the student should examine the tarsal glands, which he
will display by everting the eyelids. They are placed on the
deep surfaces of the tarsi. To the naked eye they appear
as closely placed, parallel, yellow granular-looking streaks,
which run at right angles to the free margins of the lids.
They are more numerous and of greater length in the
upper lid, and, being lodged in furrows on the deep surface
of the tarsal plates, they are distinctly visible upon both
aspects of these, even while the conjunctiva is in position.
Their ducts open upon the free margin of each lid posterior
to the eyelashes.
The Palpebral Fascia.—The palpebral fascia is a sheet of
fibrous membrane which occupies the interval between the
tarsi and the margins of the orbit, forming, with the tarsi, a
septum between the orbit and the exterior. Its peripheral
border is attached to the orbital margin, except at the medial
angle of the orbit, where it occupies a more posterior plane,
and is attached to the crista lacrimalis, posterior to the medial
palpebral ligament and the lacrimal sac. Its central border
in the lower lid is connected with the lower border of the
lower tarsus. In the upper lid it blends with the expanded
tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris, and is attached
with it to the anterior surface of the upper tarsus. It is
pierced by the supra-orbital, supra-trochlear, and lacrimal
branches of the first division of the trigeminal nerve, and
by the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery.
Raphe Palpebralis Lateralis.—The lateral palpebral raphe
(O.T. external tarsal ligament) is merely a thickening of the
palpebral fascia, between the lateral commissure and the

medial border of the fronto-sphenoidal process of the zygomatic
bone (O.T. malar), to which it connects both the tarsi.
Ligamentum Palpebrale Mediale (O.T. Internal Tarsal
Ligament).—The medial palpebral ligament is a strong fibrous
band which connects the medial ends of both tarsi to the
frontal process of the maxilla. It lies between the skin
anteriorly, and the lacrimal sac posteriorly. By its upper and
lower borders it gives attachment to fibres of the orbicularis

oculi, and by the lateral part of its posterior surface, to the
pars lacrimalis of the orbicularis oculi (O.T. tensor tarsi).
Levator Palpebrae Superioris.—Only the anterior expanded
tendon of this muscle can be seen at the present stage of the
dissection, and that, as a rule, in only a partially satisfactory
manner. The muscle arises within the orbital cavity, extends
forwards to the upper eyelid, and ends in an expanded tendon
which splits into three lamellae; a superior lamella, which
blends with the upper part of the palpebral fascia and is
attached with it to the anterior surface of the upper tarsus;
an intermediate lamella, which is connected with the upper
border of the upper tarsus; and an inferior lamella, which
gains insertion into the upper fornix of the conjunctiva. It
raises the upper eyelid by pulling on the upper tarsus, and at
the same time elevates the upper fornix of the conjunctiva.
Vessels and Nerves of the Eyelids.—At the medial com-
missure two arteries, the palpebral branches of the ophthalmic,
pierce the palpebral fascia and run laterally, one in the upper
and one in the lower lid. At the lateral margin of the
orbit, one or more branches of the lacrimal division of the
ophthalmic pierce the palpebral fascia and anastomose with

the palpebral arteries. An arterial arch, arcus tarseus, is thus
formed close to the margin of each eyelid, between the
orbicularis muscle and the tarsus.
The veins run medially towards the root of the nose and
open into the frontal and angular veins.
The nerves are more numerous and come from a number
of different sources. The motor filaments for the various
parts of the orbicularis oculi are derived from the temporal,
and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve. They enter
from the lateral margins. The sensory twigs for the upper
lid come from the lacrimal, supra-orbital, supra-trochlear, and
infra-trochlear branches of the first or ophthalmic division of
the trigeminal nerve; and the lower lid is supplied by the

infra-orbital branch of the second or maxillary division of the
fifth nerve. The lacrimal nerve will be found piercing the
palpebral fascia near the lateral part of the upper border of
the orbit; the supra-orbital lies in the supra-orbital notch at
the junction of the lateral two-thirds with the medial third of
the upper border; and the supra- and infra-trochlear pierce
the palpebral fascia at the medial end of the upper border.
The branches of the infra-orbital nerve pass to the lower lid
in the palpebral branches of the infra-orbital plexus (p. 128).
Apparatus Lacrimalis.—The following structures are in-
cluded under this head: (1) the lacrimal gland and its ducts;
(2) the conjunctival sac; (3) the puncta lacrimalia; (4) the
lacrimal ducts; (5) the lacrimal sac; (6) the naso-lacrimal
duct; (7) the lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi.
GlaMula Lacrimalis.—This lies in the upper and lateral
part of the orbital cavity under coverof the zygomatic process
(O.T. external angular) of the frontal bone. It can be exposed
by cutting through the palpebral fascia at the upper and lateral
angle of the orbit, and it will be found that the anterior part
of the gland projects slightly beyond the orbital margin and
rests upon the conjunctiva as the latter is reflected from the
lateral part of the upper lid on to the eyeball. If the anterior
border of the gland is raised and the point of the knife
carried carefully up and down in the fascia under it, several
exceedingly fine ducts will be found passing from the gland
into the lateral part of the upper fornix of the conjunctiva.
The ducts vary in number, and the secretion which they
convey, which constitutes the tears, is carried, by the in-
voluntary movements of the upper eyelid, over the exposed
surface of the eyeball and is directed towards the medial
commissure; there it passes through the puncta lacrimalia
into the lacrimal ducts, and is carried by them to the lacrimal
sac, whence it passes by the naso-lacrimal duct into the
inferior meatus of the nose. Under ordinary circumstances,
the amount of lacrimal secretion is merely sufficient for lubrica-
tion, and practically the whole of it is evaporated from the
surface of the eyeball; consequently, when the lacrimal ducts
and the lacrimal sac are extirpated, a proceeding which is
necessary under certain circumstances, the patient suffers
little or no inconvenience from the overflow of tears, so long
as the secretion is not excessive. If the amount of secretion
is greater than can be removed by evaporation, the excess,
under ordinary circumstances, passes through the puncta into
the ducts and thence through the lacrimal sac and naso-
lacrimal duct to the nose; and if the secretion becomes so
abundant that it cannot be removed by evaporation and
drainage, part flows through the rima as tears.

Saccus Lacrimalis.—The lacrimal sac is the blind upper
end of a canal which extends from the orbit to the inferior
meatus of the nose. It is lodged in the fossa lacrimalis in
the anterior part of the medial wall of the orbit. It lies
posterior to the medial palpebral ligament, from which it
receives a fibrous expansion, and it is covered on its lateral
aspect, and on the lateral part of its posterior aspect, by the pars
lacrimalis of the orbicularis oculi. The lacrimal ducts open
into its antero- lateral aspect, under cover of the medial
palpebral ligament; and it is continuous below with the naso-
lacrimal duct. The anterior wall of the sac should be incised
and a probe passed down the naso-lacrimal duct into the
nose. Note that as the probe passes along the duct it
inclines downwards, laterally and slightly posteriorly.
Pars Lacrimalis Orbicularis Oculi (O.T. Tensor Tarsi).—
This small special portion of the orbicularis oculi springs
from the posterior aspect of the lateral part of the medial
palpebral ligament and passes posteriorly and medially, round
the lateral part of the lacrimal sac, to the crista lacrimalis of
the lacrimal bone, to which it is attached. When it contracts
it compresses the lacrimal sac, and so tends to facilitate the
flow of the lacrimal secretion into the nose.
Ductus Naso-Lacrimalis.—This duct will be seen at a
later period of the dissection. It is a bony canal, lined with
muco-periosteum, which runs, in the lateral wall of the nose,
from the lacrimal sac to the upper and anterior part of the
inferior meatus. It is about half an inch long. At the medial
side of its lower end is a fold of mucous membrane, the plica
lacrimalis, which serves as a flap valve (Fig. 64).
The dissection of the face should be completed by an
examination of the nasal cartilages and the external nasal
branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.
The nerve will be found emerging between the lower border
of the nasal bone and the lateral cartilage. After its
emergence it descends to the tip of the nose supplying
filaments to the skin.
Dissection. —The cartilaginous part of the nose should now be examined
by stripping off the nasalis muscle and the remains of the integument.
Nasal Cartilages.—In addition to the septal cartilage,
which will be more appropriately studied in the dissection of
the nasal cavities, two cartilaginous plates will be found
upon each side. These are :—
1. The lateral cartilage.
2. The cartilage of the ala.
The lateral cartilage is a triangular plate which, by its
posterior margin, is attached to the lower border of the
nasal bone and the upper part of the sharp margin of the
nasal notch of the maxilla. In the median plane this cartilage

becomes continuous with its fellow of the opposite side, and
also with the subjacent anterior border of the septal cartilage
of the nose. Below, there is a slight interval between the
two lateral cartilages, in which is seen the margin of the
nasal septal cartilage. The inferior border of the lateral
cartilage is connected with the lateral part of the alar
cartilage by some dense f1brous tissue.
The alar cartilage is bent upon itself and folded round the
orifice of the nostril anteriorly and laterally. Posteriorly it
is def1cient. The lateral part is oval, and does not reach
down to the margin of the nostril, nor posteriorly as far
as the nasal notch of the maxilla. The interval between
it and the bone is filled in by fibrous tissue in which one or
two small islands of cartilage (cartilagines minores vel sesa-
moideae) appear. Anteriorly, the bent part of cartilage comes
into contact with its neighbour and forms the point of the
HEAD AND NECK
nose. Medially, the medial part of the cartilage is in the
form of a narrow strip which lies upon the lower part of the
septal cartilage, and projects slightly below it so as to support
the margin of the nostril upon this side. Its extremity is
turned slightly laterally.
SIDE OF THE NECK.
On the fourth day after the body is brought into the room
it is placed upon its back, and the dissectors of the head and
neck should examine the side of the neck and commence the
dissection of the posterior triangle.
The side of the neck is bounded below by the clavicle,
above by the lower border of the mandible, the mastoid
portion of the temporal bone, and the superior nuchal line of
the occipital bone. Anteriorly it extends to the median plane,
and posteriorly to the anterior border of the trapezius muscle.
It is divided into anterior and posterior parts, the anterior
and posterior triangles, by the sterno-mastoid muscle. If
the head is pulled over towards the opposite side, the sterno-
mastoid muscle will be seen descending from the mastoid
portion of the temporal bone and the superior nuchal line of
the occipital bone, to the upper border of the sternal third
of the clavicle and the anterior surface of the manubrium
sterni.
In the lower part of the posterior region, posterior to the
sterno-mastoid and above the convex middle third of the
clavicle, there is a depression called the fossa supraclaviculars
major, to distinguish it from the fossa supraclaviculars minor
which lies above the sternal end of the clavicle between the
sternal and clavicular heads of the sterno-mastoid. The
brachial plexus, the third part of the subclavian artery, and
the supra-clavicular lymph glands lie in the region of the
fossa supra-clavicularis major, and the fossa supra-clavicularis
minor indicates the position of the internal jugular vein near
its lower end.
POSTERIOR TRIANGLE.
Dissection.—To expose the boundaries and contents of the posterior
triangle make the following three incisions through the skin, (1) From
the back of the auricle along the upper border of the mastoid part of the
POSTERIOR TRIANGLE
143
temporal bone and the superior nuchal line to the external occipital pro-
tuberance. (2) From the sternal to the acromial end of the clavicle,
following the line of that bone. (3) Join the anterior extremities of 1 and
2 by a vertical incision passing along the back of the external acustic meatus
and then down the middle of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Reflect the flap,
thus marked out, from before backwards, and note that the skin is thicker
over the upper and posterior part of the triangle than over the lower and
anterior part.
When the skin is reflected the superficial fascia and the lower part of
the platysma muscle will be exposed.
The superficial fascia in the region of the posterior triangle
is comparatively thin, and embedded in its lower and anterior
part is the lower and posterior part of the platysma.
The Platysma.—The platysma is a thin sheet of muscle
which commences in the superficial fascia of the infra-clavi-
cular region, whence it ascends across the clavicle and through
the superficial fascia of the side of the neck, to the face where
its upper border has been examined already (p. 126). It
covers the lower and anterior part of the posterior triangle,
and the upper and posterior part of the anterior triangle; and
it is supplied by the cervical branch of the facial nerve,
which emerges from the lower end of the parotid gland.
Dissection.—Make an incision through the lower part of the platysma
along the line of the clavicle, and turn the part above the incision upwards
and anteriorly. Whilst making the incision and whilst reflecting the muscle,
be careful not to injure the supraclavicular cutaneous nerves and the
external jugular vein, which lie directly subjacent to it.
After the platysma is reflected, clean the external jugular vein, which
emerges from the lower end of the parotid and passes downwards, in-
clining posteriorly, to the lower and anterior angle of the posterior tri-
angle, where it pierces the deep fascia. Whilst cleaning the vein, avoid
injury to the nervus cutaneus colli, which sometimes crosses superficial
to the vein about the middle of its length. Secure and clean the posterior
auricular vein, which descends behind the auricle and joins the external
jugular a little below the level of the angle of the mandible. Next, find
and clean the superficial branches of the cervical plexus as they pierce the
deep fascia. They are (1) descending branches, the anterior, middle, and
posterior supra-clavicular nerves. (2) A transverse branch, the nervus
cutaneus colli (O.T. transverse cervical). (3) Ascending branches, the
great auricular and the small occipital.
The anterior and middle supra-clavicular nerves will be found piercing
the deep fascia immediately above the clavicle, the anterior at the posterior
border of the sterno-mastoid and the middle above the convexity of the
clavicle. They descend into the pectoral region as far as the lower border
of the second rib and their lower portions will be displayed by the dissector
of the arm. The posterior supra-clavicular nerves pierce the deep fascia at
a somewhat higher level. They descend across the lower and anterior part
of the trapezius to the acromial region, and to the skin of the arm over the
upper part of the deltoid, where they will be exposed by the dissector of
the arm.
HEAD AND NECK
The Deep Fascia.—The deep fascia forms the superficial
boundary or roof of the posterior triangle. It is attached
below to the upper border of the middle third of the clavicle;

F1g. 66.—The superficial branches of the cervical plexus.
above, to the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone;
anteriorly it is continuous with the fascia of the sterno-mastoid
and posteriorly with the fascia of the trapezius. It is pierced
by (1) the supra-clavicular branches of the cervical plexus, (2)
the external jugular vein, (3) small cutaneous branches of the
145
transverse cervical, transverse scapular (O.T. suprascapular),
and occipital arteries, and, occasionally, by the occipital artery
itself. It is not a very strong layer, and it is frequently difficult
to display it as a continuous sheet. Over the upper part of the
triangle it forms a single layer, but below, it splits into two
lamellae, a superficial and a deep. The superficial layer which
is already displayed, is attached to the upper border of the
clavicle from the sterno-mastoid anteriorly to the trapezius
posteriorly. It is pierced by the external jugular vein and
the supraclavicular nerves.
Dissection.—Trace the supraclavicular nerves upwards through the deep
fascia to the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid; then, pulling them aside,
cut through the superficial layer of the deep fascia immediately above the
clavicle and along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and turn it
upwards. Introduce the handle of the scalpel behind the clavicle and note
that it can be passed downwards as far as the posterior border of the lower
surface of the bone. Its further progress is barred by the attachment of
the second layer of the deep fascia to this border, where it blends with the
posterior lamella of the costo-coracoid membrane. Pass the handle of the
knife forwards behind the sterno-mastoid and note that, without using any
great force, it can be pushed medially until it crosses the median plane;
therefore, the space between the two layers of deep fascia in the lower part
of the posterior triangle is continuous anteriorly with the space which lies
above and posterior to the manubrium sterni, between the first and the second
layers of the deep fascia of the anterior part of the neck. Laterally, this
space extends as far as the coracoid process, and upwards to a short distance
above the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle. Clear away the areolar
tissue which lies between the two layers of the deep fascia, and expose a
further part of the external jugular vein, and the terminal parts of the
transverse cervical and the transverse scapular (suprascapular) veins, as
they join the posterior border of the external jugular. Pull the lower part
of the external jugular vein posteriorly and expose the termination of the
anterior jugular vein in its anterior border. Dissect carefully behind the
clavicle and find the transverse scapular (suprascapular) artery. Trace the
second layer of the deep fascia upwards and note that it is continuous with
the fascia which surrounds the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle;
indeed it is the tension of this portion of the deep fascia which holds the
posterior belly of the muscle down in its position.
Remove the remaining parts of the deep fascia, first from the upper,
and then from the lower part of the triangle, and expose the floor and the
remaining contents of the triangle.
Commence above, in the region of the junction of the upper third and
the lower two-thirds of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and
secure the great auricular, the small occipital, the accessory nerve, and the
nervus cutaneus colli. The great auricular is most easily found. It turns
round the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, in the region indicated,
and runs upwards and anteriorly, parallel with and slightly above and
posterior to the external jugular vein. The small occipital will be found
hooking round the lower border of the accessory nerve a little above the
great auricular; and the nervus cutaneus colli lies a little below the great
auricular.
Follow the small occipital and the great auricular nerves to their
VOL. II—10
HEAD AND NECK
terminations, but the nervus cutaneus colli must be traced only to the
point where it crosses either superficial or deep to the external jugular vein.
It eventually divides into upper and lower terminal branches, which will be
seen when the anterior triangle is dissected.
Nervus Occipitalis Minor.—The small occipital is a sensory
branch of the second cervical nerve. It emerges from under
cover of the sterno-mastoid, and ascends for a short distance
along its posterior border, then it passes to the superficial
surface of the muscle, pierces the deep fascia, and divides
into occipital, mastoid, and auricular branches. The occi-
pital and mastoid branches supply the skin in the regions
indicated by their names. The auricular is distributed to the
skin of the upper third of the cranial surface of the auricle.
Nervus Auricularis Magnus.—This consists of cutaneous
filaments derived from the second and third cervical nerves.
After turning round the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid
it runs upwards and anteriorly, towards the angle of the
mandible, in the deep fascia on the superficial surface of
the sterno-mastoid, and breaks up into three sets of terminal
branches, mastoid, auricular, and facial. The mastoid branches
go to the skin of the mastoid region. The auricular branches
supply the skin of the lower two-thirds of the cranial surface
and the lower third of the lateral surface of the auricle. The
facial branches, which have already been seen, ramify in the
posterior part of the face, in the parotid and masseteric regions.
Some of the filaments enter the substance of the parotid.
Dissection.—The accessory nerve, previously found at the junction of
the upper third with the lower two-thirds of the posterior border of the
sterno-mastoid, must now be traced downwards and posteriorly, through
the triangle, to the point where it disappears under cover of the trapezius,
at the junction of the upper two-thirds with the lower third of the anterior
border of that muscle. As the nerve is cleaned, attempt to secure twigs
from the third and fourth cervical nerves which communicate with it in
the posterior triangle.
Turn next to the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, which
crosses the lower part of the triangle. Note that it divides the triangle
into a large upper or occipital portion, and a small lower or subclavian
portion. Cut through the fascia on the surface of the muscle, parallel with
the muscle fibres, and turn it upwards and downwards; then turn the
upper border of the muscle laterally and find the nerve from the ansa
hypoglossi, which emerges from under cover of the sterno-mastoid and
enters the deep surface of the omo hyoid to supply it.
Take away the remains of the superficial layer of deep fascia, and the
areolar tissue beneath it from the upper part of the triangle. Whilst
removing the latter note a number of lymph glands which lie embedded
in it along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, superficial to the
stems and branches of the cervical nerves. At the apex of the triangle
look for the occipital artery, which either emerges between the adjacent
147
borders of the trapezius and the sterno-mastoid, or pierces the trapezius a
little further posteriorly.
Between the accessory nerve above and the posterior belly of the omo-
hyoid below find (1) the upper part of the brachial plexus; (2) its branch
to the subclavius; (3) its suprascapular branch; (4) its dorsalis scapulae
branch; (5) its long thoracic branch; (6) branches from the third and
fourth cervical nerves to the levator scapulae; (7) branches from the third
and fourth cervical nerves to the trapezius, and others which communicate
with the accessory nerve in the posterior triangle; and (8) the upper and
posterior part of the transverse cervical artery. Find the transverse cervical
artery as it appears from under cover of the upper border of the omo-hyoid.
It runs upwards and posteriorly. Next secure the nerve to the subclavius,
which lies under cover of the deep fascia above the omo-hyoid and a short
distance behind the sterno-mastoid. Trace it upwards to its origin from
the trunk formed by the union of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. Clean
the latter nerves and the upper part of the seventh cervical nerve, which
lies immediately below them. Then find the suprascapular nerve, which
springs from the lateral border of the trunk formed by the fifth and sixth
nerves. It lies immediately above the anterior part of the posterior belly
of the omo-hyoid, and disappears under cover of the posterior part.
Turn the trunk formed by the fifth and sixth cervical nerves anteriorly and
find, posterior to it, the upper roots of the long thoracic nerve, which spring
from the fifth and sixth nerves, and are emerging through the fibres of the
scalenus medius muscle. The nervus dorsalis scapulae (O.T. nerve to the
rhomboids) lies at a slightly higher level than the suprascapular nerve. It
springs from the fifth cervical nerve, runs downwards and posteriorly, and
disappears, through the floor of the triangle, between the adjacent borders
of the levator scapulae above and the scalenus medius below. Above the
dorsal scapular nerve are the branches from the third and fourth cervical
nerves to the trapezius and the communications to the accessory nerve.
When the structures mentioned above have been found and cleaned,
proceed to the dissection of the subclavian portion of the triangle. Find
the transverse scapular artery (O.T. suprascapular), which lies behind the
clavicle, and therefore, strictly speaking, outside the limits of the triangle.
Then remove the second layer of deep cervical fascia which binds the
posterior belly of the omo-hyoid to the posterior border of the clavicle, and
find behind it (1) a further part of the external jugular vein; (2) a further
part of the transverse cervical artery; (3) the lower part of the nerve to the
subclavius; (4) the upper portion of the third part of the subclavian artery;
(5) the lowest root and the lower parts of the trunks of the brachial plexus;
(6) a part of the long thoracic nerve; (7) supraclavicular lymph glands.
First clean the lower end of the external jugular vein and follow it
behind the clavicle to its termination in the subclavian vein. Note the
valves near its lower end. Next clean the transverse cervical artery and
the nerve to the subclavius. Follow the nerve to the subclavius across
the front of the third part of the subclavian artery; and afterwards clean
the lower part of the subclavian artery and the adjacent part of the
brachial plexus, which lies behind and above the artery. Note that the
artery and the plexus are covered by a layer of deep cervical fascia, the
backward prolongation of the prevertebral layer of fascia, which passes on
to them from the lateral border of the scalenus anterior, and is prolonged
along them to become continuous with the sheath of the axillary artery.
As the areolar tissue is cleared from the subclavian portion of the
triangle a number of supraclavicular lymph glands may be noted. They
receive lymph from the axillary glands, and they transmit it to the large
lymph vessels at the root of the neck.

HEAD AND NECK
After the contents of the lower part of the triangle are thoroughly cleaned,
remove the remains of the fascia covering the muscles which form
the floor of the triangle. Note that this fascia is continuous anteriorly,
round the tips of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae with the
prevertebral fascia. Posteriorly it blends with the sheaths of the deeper

muscles at the back of the neck; above it is attached to the superior
nuchal line; and below, as already stated, it is prolonged into the axilla
along the axillary vessels and nerves.
Boundaries and Contents of the Posterior Triangle.—The
dissection of the triangle should be completed in two days.
On the third day the dissector should revise his knowledge
of the boundaries and the relative positions of the contents.
149
The triangle is bounded anteriorly by the posterior border
of the sterno-mastoid ; posteriorly by the anterior border of the
trapezius; below by the upper border of the middle third
of the clavicle; and above by the superior nuchal line of the
occipital bone, or by the meeting of the upper ends of the sterno-
mastoid and the trapezius. The roof is formed by the deep
cervical fascia, which is covered by superficial fascia and skin,
and in its lower and anterior part by the platysma, which is
embedded in the superficial fascia. It is pierced by (1) the
external jugular vein at the lower and anterior angle; (2) the
supraclavicular nerves, a short distance above the clavicle;
(3) small cutaneous branches of the transverse scapular, trans-
verse cervical, and occipital arteries; (4) lymphatic vessels
passing from the superficial structures to the glands in the
triangle. It is frequently stated that the small occipital, the
great auricular, and the cervical cutaneous nerves also
pierce the roof. As a general rule they turn round the
posterior border of the sterno-mastoid under cover of the
fascia, and pierce the fascia as it lies on the muscle.
The floor is formed by the splenius capitis, the levator
scapulae, the scalenus medius, and the scalenus posterior
muscles, with the addition, occasionally, of a small part of the
semispinalis capitis (O.T. complexus) above, and the upper
serration of the serratus anterior below; the latter appears
in the area of the triangle only when the clavicle is very
fully depressed. The muscles of the floor are covered with
a layer of fascia which is the backward continuation of the
prevertebral fascia of the anterior cervical region.

Some of the contents of the triangle which are now
displayed require further consideration.
The Posterior Belly of the Omo-hyoid Muscle.—The
posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle springs from the
upper border of the scapula and upper transverse scapular
ligament. It enters the posterior triangle, at its lower and
posterior angle, and runs upwards and anteriorly, at a
variable distance from the clavicle, to the posterior border
of the sterno-mastoid. Either immediately behind or
under cover of the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid it
joins the intermediate tendon which connects it with the
anterior belly. Its nerve has already been seen entering
its deep surface (p. 146) it divides the posterior triangle
into a lower or subclavian portion and an upper or occipital
portion.
The Accessory Nerve (O.T. Spinal Accessory). — The
portion of the accessory nerve which appears in the posterior
triangle consists of fibres which arise from the cervical part
of the spinal medulla and with them are incorporated some
filaments derived from the second cervical nerve. Before
appearing in their present situation the spinal fibres entered
the cranium through the foramen magnum and left it by pass-
ing through the jugular foramen; then they passed downwards
and posteriorly, through the deeper fibres of sterno-mastoid,
where they received the communication from the second cervical
nerve. As already pointed out, the nerve usually enters the
posterior triangle at the level of the union of the upper third
with the lower two-thirds of the posterior border of the sterno-
mastoid. It runs downwards and posteriorly through the
triangle, along the line of the levator scapulae, and disappears
under the trapezius at the junction of the upper two-thirds
with the lower third of its anterior border. As it enters the
triangle the small occipital nerve turns round its lower border,
and, as it crosses the triangle, it is joined by twigs from the
third and fourth cervical nerves.
The Branches of the Cervical Plexus.—The dissector
should note that whilst many of the branches of the cervical
plexus lie within the area of the posterior triangle, the
plexus itself is under cover of the upper part of the sterno-
mastoid, where it will be exposed and studied when the
sterno - mastoid is reflected. The branches which appear
in the triangle are the superficial branches—the small occipital,
the great auricular, the nervus cutaneus colli, and the supra-
clavicular nerves; and the deep posterior branches, that is,
the nerves to the scalenus medius and posterior, the nerve
to the levator scapula?, the branches to the trapezius and the
communication to the accessory nerve.
The Third Part of the Subclavian Artery. — Only a
portion of this part of the subclavian artery is in the triangle;
the lower and lateral part is behind the clavicle. The part
in the triangle is situated deeply in the anterior inferior
angle and below the omo-hyoid muscle. It is covered with the
skin, superficial fascia, the platysma, deep fascia, the external
jugular vein, the ends of the transverse scapular, and trans-
verse cervical veins, and the nerve to the subclavius muscle.
Behind it is the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus, which
separates it from the insertion of the scalenus medius. Below,
it rests upon the first rib, against which it can be compressed,
and, more medially, on the cervical pleura.
The Brachial Plexus and its Supraclavicular Branches.—
Only the upper portion of the brachial plexus lies in the
region of the posterior triangle, i.e. the roots, the trunks, and
some of the branches; the remainder lies either posterior to
the clavicle or in the axilla. The cervical portion lies in the
lower and anterior part of the posterior triangle partly in
the occipital and partly in the supraclavicular areas. The
detailed study of the plexus should be left till the fifth day
after the body has been placed upon its back, when the
dissector of the head and neck will assist the dissector of the
upper extremity to disarticulate the clavicle and to lay bare
the whole of the plexus (p. 160).
The fourth day after the body has been placed upon its
back should be devoted to the study of the temporal region
and the anterior part of the scalp.
THE SCALP AND THE SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURES
OF THE TEMPORAL REGION.
Under the term "scalp " are included the soft structures
which cover the vault of the cranium above the temporal
ridges and anterior to the superior nuchal line. Its con-
stituent parts are arranged in live layers: (1) skin; (2) super-
ficial fascia; (3) the epicranius, consisting of four muscular

bellies, the two occipitales and the two frontales muscles, and
the aponeurosis called the galea aponeurotica, which connects
them together; (4) a layer of loose areolar tissue; (5) the
periosteum, which is here called the pericranium. In the
temporal region the wall of the cranium is much more thickly
covered than in the scalp area, and it is possible to distinguish
eight layers of soft tissues between the surface and the bone:
(1) skin; (2) superficial fascia; (3) extrinsic muscles of the
ear; (4) the thin lateral extensions of the galea aponeurotica;
(5) a thin layer of fascia descending from the temporal ridge
to the auricle; (6) the strong temporal fascia; (7) the temporal
muscle; (8) periosteum.
The Scalp.—The scalp and the superficial temporal region
are richly supplied with blood vessels and nerves, which all
AURICLE
*53
enter from the periphery, passing into the superficial fascia
after piercing the deep fascia of adjacent regions. As a
consequence of this arrangement large flaps of the scalp may
be torn from the centre towards the margin, but, so long as
they remain attached at the periphery, their sources of
vitality are not seriously interfered with, and if they are cleaned
and replaced healing occurs rapidly and satisfactorily.
Dissection.—The skin has already been removed from the anterior
parts of the scalp and the temporal region. A median longitudinal in-
cision must now be made through the skin of the posterior part of the
scalp as far as the external occipital protuberance, and the flap on either
side of the incision must be turned downwards and posteriorly to the
superior nuchal line. When this has been done the dissector should ex-
amine the auricle of the external ear, and familiarise himself with its various
parts before he commences the dissection of its extrinsic muscles.

F1g. 69. —The Auricle.
Auricle or Pinna.—The auricle consists of a thin plate of
yellow fibro-cartilage, covered with integument. It is fixed in
position by certain ligaments, and possesses two sets of feeble
muscles—viz., one group termed the extrinsic muscles, passing
to the cartilage from the aponeurosis of the epicranius and
the mastoid process, and a second group in connection with
the cartilage alone, and therefore called the intrinsic muscles.
The concha is the wide and deep fossa which leads into
the external meatus; the antihelix is the curved prominence
which bounds this posteriorly; the helix is the folded or in-
curved margin of the auricle; and the lobule is its soft
dependent part. The concha is partially subdivided into an
upper and a lower part by the commencement of the helix,
which curves upwards and forwards on its floor to become
continuous with the anterior border of the auricle. This
portion of the helix is called the crus helicis. A small pro-

HEAD AND NECK
minence anterior to the meatus, and projecting posteriorly so
as to overshadow it, is termed the tragus, whilst a similar
eminence posterior to and below the meatus receives the name
of the antitragus. The notch between these two prominences
is termed the incisura intertragica. But it will be noted that
the upper end of the antihelix bifurcates, and in this way two
fossae are marked off from each other; one—the fossa of the
helix, or scaphoid fossa—is placed between the helix and the
antihelix, and the other-—the fossa of the antihelix, or triangular
fossa — is situated between the two diverging crura of the
antihelix.
Dissection.—When the dissector has noted the various parts of the
auricle he should endeavour to display its extrinsic muscles; they are the
auriculares anterior (O.T. attrahens), superior (O.T. attollens), and posterior
(O.T. retrahens). The two former spring from a lateral prolongation
of the galea aponeurotica into the temporal region. The anterior is
inserted into the front of the helix, and the superior into the cranial surface
of the auricle. To display them pull the auricle downwards and posteriorly,
and carefully remove the superficial fascia and, at the same time, avoid injury
to the auriculo-temporal nerve, the temporal branches of the facial nerve,
and the branches of the superficial temporal artery which are ascending
through the superficial fascia of the temporal region to the scalp. The
auricularis posterior arises from the outer surface of the mastoid part of
the temporal bone and passes anteriorly to its insertion into the cranial
aspect of the concha. To display it pull the auricle anteriorly and remove
the fascia from the surface of the muscle, at the same time secure the
posterior auricular artery and nerve as these ascend posterior to the external
meatus. As this is being done one or more mastoid lymph glands may
be seen, and care must be taken to avoid injuring the branch of the
posterior auricular nerve to the occipitalis muscle, which passes posteriorly
along the lower border of the auricularis posterior or on its deep surface.
The auriculares muscles are supplied by the facial nerve; the anterior
and the anterior part of the superior by its temporal branches, and the
posterior and the posterior part of the superior by the posterior
auricular branch. After the auriculares muscles have been defined remove
the skin from the entire extent of the auricle to display the cartilage, the
ligaments, and the intrinsic muscles.1 Great care is required to make a
successful dissection.
1 In most cases it will be advisable to defer this part of the dissection till
the body is turned on its back for the second time (p. 200).

Upon the cranial face of
the cartilage.
Upon the lateral face of the
cat tilage.
The auricular cartilage extends throughout the entire auricle, with the
exception of the lobule and the portion between the tragus and the helix.
These portions are composed merely of integument, fatty tissue, and
condensed connective tissue. The shape of the cartilage corresponds with
that of the auricle itself. It shows the same elevations and depressions,
and by its elasticity it serves to maintain the form of the auricle. But it
also enters into the formation of the cartilaginous or lateral portion of the
external acustic meatus. By its medial margin this part of the cartilage
is firmly fixed by fibrous tissue to the rough outer edge of the auditory
process of the temporal bone, but it does not form a complete tube. It is
deficient above and anteriorly, and here the tube of the meatus is completed
by tough fibrous membrane, which stretches between the tragus and the
commencement of the helix.
In a successful dissection of the cartilage of the auricle, two other points
will attract the attention of the student. The first is a deep slit, which
passes upwards so as to separate the lower part of the cartilage of the
helix, termed the processus helicis caudatus, from the cartilage of the anti-
tragus; the second is a sharp spur of cartilage which projects anteriorly
from the helix, at the level of the upper margin of the zygoma. This is
termed the spina helicis.
The Ligaments of the Auricle. — The ligaments are three bands of
fascia. The anterior passes from the spine of the helix to the root of the
zygoma. The superior and posterior are both attached to the cartilage in
the region of the concha ; the former blends above with the temporal fascia,
and the latter is attached to the mastoid portion of the temporal bone.
The Intrinsic Muscles of the Auricle.—The two muscles of the helix,
the tragicus and the antitragicus, are placed upon the lateral face of the
cartilage. The transversus and the obliquus lie upon the cranial surface of
the auricle.
The musculus antitragicus is the best-marked member of the lateral
group. It lies upon the lateral surface of the antitragus, and its fibres pass
obliquely upwards and posteriorly. Some fasciculi can be traced to the
processus helicis caudatus.
The musculus tragicus is a minute bundle of short vertical fibres
situated upon the lateral surface of the tragus. When well developed a
slender fasciculus may sometimes be observed to pass upwards from it to
the anterior part of the helix, where it is inserted into the spine of the helix.
The musculus helicis major is a well-marked band, which springs from
the spina helicis, and extends upwards upon the anterior part of the helix,
to be inserted into the skin which covers it.
The musculus helicis minor is a minute bundle of fleshy fibres which is
placed upon the crus helicis as it crosses the bottom of the concha.
The musculus transversus auricula is found upon the cranial aspect of
the auricle. It is generally the most strongly developed muscle of the
series, and its fibres bridge across the hollow which, on this aspect of the
auricle, corresponds to the antihelix.
The musculus obliquus auricula is composed of some vertical fasciculi
bridging across the depression which corresponds to the eminence of the
lower limb of the antihelix.
After the auricular muscles and the auricle have been dissected, trace
the temporal branches of the facial nerve, the branches of the super-
ficial temporal vessels, and the auriculo-temporal nerve upwards, from
the point where they emerge from under cover of the upper end of the
parotid through the superficial fascia of the temporal region to their termina-
tions in the superficial fascia of the scalp. About half an inch behind the
zygomatic process of the frontal bone (O.T. external angular process) find
the zygomaticotemporal branch of the maxillary nerve. Next pull the
auricle anteriorly and trace the posterior auricular nerve to its termination
in the occipitalis muscle, and in the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles
of the auricle, and the posterior auricular artery to its anastomoses with
the occipital and superficial temporal arteries. After this part of the
dissection is completed, turn to the anterior part of the scalp and find
the medial and lateral branches of the supra-orbital nerve. The medial
branch pierces the fibres of the frontalis and the lateral branch pierces
the galea aponeurotica a little further posteriorly. Trace both branches
backwards through the superficial fascia as far as possible; they extend to
the level of the lambdoid suture. Then secure the supra-trochlear nerve,
which pierces the frontalis above the medial margin of the orbit, and trace
it upwards to its termination. With the branches of the supra-orbital nerve
are branches of the supra-orbital artery, and the supra-trochlear nerve is
accompanied by the frontal branch of the ophthalmic artery.
When the nerves and vessels in the anterior region have been cleaned,
the head should be turned well over to the opposite side, and the branches
of the occipital artery and the great occipital nerve should be sought for in
the posterior region; they radiate upwards and anteriorly from the upper
extremity of the trapezius. After they have been secured, the occipitalis
muscle must be cleaned. It springs from the lateral part of the superior
nuchal line, and after a short course upwards and anteriorly it terminates in
the galea aponeurotica. The remains of the superficial fascia should now
be removed from the surface of the galea aponeurotica (O.T. epicranial
aponeurosis), and then the dissector should make a survey of the vessels
and nerves which are met with in the scalp and the superficial fascia of the
temporal region. ^
Nerves and Vessels of the Scalp and the Superficial
Temporal Region.—Branches of ten nerves are found, on each
side, in the superficial fascia of the region which lies above
the supra-orbital margin, the zygomatic arch and the superior
nuchal line. Of these, five lie mainly anterior to the auricle
and five posterior to it; and of each group four are sensory
and one is motor. The four sensory nerves anterior to the
auricle are all branches of the trigeminal nerve. They are
the supra-trochlear and supra-orbital branches of the first or
ophthalmic division; the zygomatico-temporal branch of the
maxillary or second division; and the auriculo-temporal branch
of the mandibular or third division. The motor nerve is the
temporal branch of the facial nerve.
The four sensory nerves, distributed mainly to the scalp
area behind the auricle, are the great auricular and the small
occipital branches of the cervical plexus; the great occipital,
which is the medial division of the posterior branch of the
second cervical nerve; and the smallest occipital, not yet seen,
but which will be displayed when the body is turned on its
face. It lies medial to the great occipital, and is the medial
division of the posterior branch of the third cervical nerve.
NERVES AND VESSELS OF SCALP 157
The motor nerve distributed posterior to the auricle is the
posterior auricular branch of the facial nerve.
The arteries distributed to the scalp are five in number on
each side; they anastomose freely, and are derived, either
indirectly or directly, from the internal and external carotid
arteries. Three are distributed mainly anterior to, and two
posterior to the region of the auricle. The three anterior to
the auricle are the frontal and supra-orbital branches of the
ophthalmic branch of the internal carotid, which accompany
the supra-trochlear and supra-orbital nerves, and the superficial
temporal branch of the external carotid. This branch divides
into two main branches, an anterior, which accompanies the
temporal branches of the facial nerve, and is usually a very
tortuous vessel, and a posterior branch, which accompanies the
auriculo-temporal nerve, as it ascends anterior to the auricle
towards the vertex of the cranium. The two arteries posterior
to the auricle are both branches of the external carotid. They
are the posterior auricular, which accompanies the posterior
auricular branch of the facial nerve to the mastoid region
and the posterior part of the parietal region, and the occipital,
which is distributed to the occipital area and posterior part
of the parietal area.
The terminations of the veins which drain the blood from
the scalp are as follows. The frontal and supra-orbital veins
unite, at the medial border of the orbit, to form the angular
vein, which is the commencement of the anterior facial vein
already dissected (p. 131). The blood it conveys passes
eventually to the internal jugular vein. The superficial
temporal vein accompanies the corresponding artery. It unites,
immediately above the posterior root of the zygoma, with the
middle temporal vein, which pierces the temporal fascia at
that point. The trunk formed by the union of the superficial
and middle temporal veins is the posterior facial vein, which
descends through the parotid gland, emerges from under
cover of its lower end and terminates immediately below the
angle of the mandible by joining with the anterior facial vein
to form the common facial vein. Whilst in the gland, it gives
off the commencement of the external jugular vein. The
posterior auricular vein descends posterior to the external
meatus and terminates in the external jugular vein. The
occipital vein accompanies the occipital artery into the sub-
occipital region, and ends in the sub-occipital venous plexus.
In addition to the arteries and veins there are numerous
lymph vessels in the scalp, but they cannot be displayed by
ordinary dissecting methods. Nevertheless, it is important
that the student should remember their usual terminations.
The lymph vessels of the anterior area end in small lymph
glands which are embedded in the superficial surface of the
parotid gland. Those of the posterior area terminate either
in lymph glands which lie superficial to the mastoid part of
the temporal bone, or in occipital lymph glands, which lie in
the neighbourhood of the superior nuchal line.
Dissection.—After the vessels and nerves of the scalp have been traced,
the dissector should cut through the fibres of the orbicularis oculi and the
frontalis over the medial part of the supra-orbital eminence and display the
corrugator supercilii muscle. It springs from the medial end of the
supra-orbital ridge of the frontal bone and passes anteriorly and laterally,
through the fibres of the orbicularis oculi, to its insertion into the skin of
the eyebrow. It is supplied by the temporal branch of the facial nerve.
Galea Aponeurotica (O.T. Epicranial Aponeurosis).—The
galea aponeurotica is fully exposed as soon as the superf1cial
fascia of the scalp is completely removed. It is a strong
layer of aponeurosis connected anteriorly with the frontal
bellies of the epicranius, posteriorly with the occipital bellies,
and between the occipital bellies, with the external occipital
protuberance and the medial parts of the superior nuchal lines,
or with the supreme nuchal lines when they are present.
Laterally it becomes thinner, descends over the upper part of
the temporal fascia, and gives origin to the anterior and
superior auriculares muscles. It is so closely connected
with the superjacent skin, by the dense superficial fascia,
that the two cannot be separated, except with the aid of
the cutting edge of the scalpel; but above the supra-orbital
ridges, the temporal ridges, and the superior nuchal lines it
is only loosely connected to the pericranium by the layer
of loose areolar tissue; therefore the three closely connected
superficial layers, the skin, superficial fascia, and the galea
aponeurotica, can easily be torn from the pericranium, a
circumstance taken advantage of by the Indians who scalped
their defeated foes. The looseness of the areolar tissue
beneath the galea aponeurotica permits the latter to be
drawn forwards and backwards by the alternate contractions
of the occipitalis and frontalis muscles, and, as it moves, it
carries with it the skin and superficial fascia with which
it is so closely blended.
SCALP
159
Dissection.—The dissector, after studying the attachments of the galea
aponeurotica, and after he has made himself thoroughly conversant with
the nerve and vascular supply of the scalp, and has appreciated the fact
that every part of its area is supplied by more than one nerve and that the
blood vessels anastomose very freely together, should next convince himself
of the greater looseness of the areolar layer beneath the galea in the medial
area and its greater denseness and closer attachment to the various parts
of the superjacent epicranius, and the subjacent pericranium at the margins
of the scalp area. He may do this by introducing the handle of a scalpel
through a median incision in the galea, and passing it anteriorly and
posteriorly and from side to side.
The Layer of Loose Areolar Tissue.—This is the fourth
layer of the scalp. It is but slightly vascular and is of loose
texture, but is not equally loose over the whole area of the
scalp; on the contrary in the regions of the temporal and
supra-orbital ridges it becomes much denser, and, at the same
time, much more closely connected with the galea aponeurotica
and the frontalis muscles, whilst posteriorly it disappears
where the occipitalis muscles and the galea become attached
to the superior nuchal lines. It is on account of these
peculiarities that effusions of blood or inflammatory exudations
in the areolar layer easily raise the greater part of the scalp
from the bone, but such effusions do not readily pass from
beneath the scalp into either the facial, temporal, or occipital
regions.
On the fifth day after the body has been placed upon its
back, the eighth after it was brought into the room, the
dissector of the head and neck must assist the dissector of
the upper extremity to display the whole extent of the brachial
plexus and the origins of the branches which spring from it;
and he should take the opportunity to revise his own know-
ledge of the plexus. Detach the clavicular head of the
sterno-mastoid from the clavicle, and displace the sternal
head towards the median plane. When this has been done
the anterior and upper parts of the sterno-clavicular joint
capsule will be fully exposed, for the pectoralis major, which
covered the lower part of the anterior surface, has already
been reflected by the dissector of the upper extremity.
Dissection.—The sterno-clavicular joint is described on p. 28 of Vol. I.
After the dissectors have noted that the fibres of the capsule run medially
and downwards from the clavicle to the sternum, the anterior, superior,
and posterior portions must be divided close to the sternum, care being
taken to avoid injury to the anterior jugular vein, which passes laterally
close to the upper and back part of the joint. When the division is
completed, elevate the sternal end of the clavicle by depressing the
HEAD AND NECK
acromial end, introduce the knife into the cavity of the joint, close
to the sternum, and carry it laterally below the clavicle, to detach
the lower part of the interarticular cartilage from the sternum and
the cartilage of the first rib, and to divide the lower part of the capsule
and the costo-clavicular ligament, which lies immediately lateral to it. If
the subclavius muscle has not already been detached, it also must be divided,
and then the clavicle can be displaced laterally, and the whole extent of
the plexus will be exposed.
The Brachial Plexus.—The brachial plexus is fully described on p. 28,
Vol. I., and only a brief resume of the main facts regarding it is given here.
The plexus is formed by the last four cervical nerves and the larger part
of the first thoracic nerve; it also receives a communication from the fourth
cervical nerve and not uncommonly a small twig from the second thoracic
nerve. These various nerves constitute the roots of the plexus. The roots
of the plexus emerge from between the scalenus medius and the scalenus
anterior, and unite to form three trunks, upper, middle, and lower, which
lie superficial to the scalenus medius, the lowest of the three being wedged in
between that muscle posteriorly and the third part of the subclavian artery
anteriorly. The upper trunk is formed by the fifth and sixth nerves and the
communication from the fourth. The seventh nerve alone forms the middle
trunk; and the lowest trunk is formed by the eighth cervical and first
thoracic nerves and the communication from the second thoracic. Almost
immediately after their formation the trunks divide into anterior and
posterior divisions, and the divisions reunite to form three cords, lateral,
medial, and posterior. The lateral cord is formed by the anterior divisions
of the upper and middle trunks, the medial cord by the anterior division of
the lowest trunk, and all three posterior divisions unite to form the posterior
cord. The cords descend behind the clavicle and subclavius muscle,
through the cervico-axillary canal, to the level of the coracoid process of
the scapula where the plexus terminates and each cord divides into two
terminal branches. The terminal branches of the lateral cord are the
lateral head of the median nerve and the musculo cutaneous nerve. Those
of the medial cord are the medial head of the median and the ulnar nerve,
and the posterior cord divides into the axillary (O.T. circumflex) nerve
and the radial (O.T. musculo-spiral). In addition to the terminal branches,
collateral branches are given off from the roots, the trunks and the cords;
and the roots are connected with the middle and lower ganglia of the
cervical part of the sympathetic trunk by grey rami communicantes. The
branches given off from the roots are twigs of supply to the longus colli,
the scalenus anterior, the scalenus medius, and the scalenus posterior, the
roots of origin of the long thoracic nerve, which supplies the serratus anterior
(O.T. magnus) and the dorsal scapular nerve (O.T. nerve to the rhomboids).
The roots of the long thoracic nerve spring from the fifth, sixth, and seventh
nerves; the upper two pierce the scalenus medius and the lowest passes
anterior to that muscle. The three unite, behind the trunks of the plexus,
to form the stem of the nerve, which descends behind the cords of the
plexus into the axilla. The dorsalis scapulae nerve arises from the lateral
border of the fifth nerve; it disappears under cover of the levator scapulae
and supplies the two rhomboid muscles, and, sometimes, the levator scapulae.
The branches from the trunks of the plexus are the suprascapular nerve
and the nerve to the subclavius. They both spring from the upper trunk.
The collateral branches of the three cords of the plexus, are (1) from the
outer cord : the lateral anterior thoracic nerve ; (2) from the posterior cord:
the upper and lower subscapular nerves and the thoraco-dorsal nerve
(O.T. long subscapular); and (3) from the medial cord : the medial anterior
thoracic, the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm (O.T. lesser internal
THE DISSECTION OF THE BACK 161
cutaneous) and the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (O.T. internal
cutaneous).
The Position of the Brachial Plexus.—The plexus lies in the lower and
anterior part of the posterior triangle of the neck, partly above and partly
below the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid; posterior to the clavicle; and
in the axilla. Above the clavicle it is covered by the skin, the superficial
fascia and the platysma, branches of the supraclavicular nerves, the first
layer of deep fascia, the external jugular vein, and the terminal parts of the
transverse cervical and transverse (supra) scapular veins; the second
layer of deep cervical fascia, the transverse cervical artery, the posterior
belly of the omo-hyoid, the nerve to the subclavius, and the third part of
the subclavian artery. Behind the clavicle it is crossed superficially by
the transverse scapular artery (O.T. suprascapular). Below the clavicle it
is covered by the skin and superficial fascia, the platysma, the middle
supraclavicular nerves, the deep fascia, the pectoralis major, the pectoralis
minor, the cephalic vein, the branches of the thoraco acromial artery, the
costo-coracoid membrane, and the axillary artery and vein.
Its posterior relations in the neck are the scalenus medius and the long
thoracic nerve. In the axilla the serratus anterior, the fat in the interval
between the serratus anterior and the subscapularis, and finally the sub-
scapularis itself.
After the brachial plexus has been examined, the clavicle must be
replaced in position and the skin flap, reflected from the posterior triangle,
must be replaced and fixed in position by a few sutures.
On the ninth day after the body is brought into the room,
that is, on the sixth day after it has been placed on its back,
it will be turned upon its face, with the thorax and the pelvis
supported by blocks. The body will remain upon its face for
five days, and during that period the dissectors of the head
and neck must complete the dissection of the posterior part
of the scalp; dissect the muscles, vessels and nerves of the
back and the suboccipital region; and remove and examine
the spinal medulla.
THE DISSECTION OF THE BACK.
Dissection.—Make a median longitudinal incision from the external
occipital protuberance to the seventh cervical spine, and a second laterally
from the seventh cervical spine to the acromion, and throw the flap laterally.
When this has been done the posterior triangle will be exposed from behind,
and the dissector should take the opportunity of noting the positions of the
contents and the constituent parts of the floor from this aspect. Afterwards
he must look for the superficial nerves in the superficial fascia over the
upper part of the trapezius. If the great occipital nerve was not found
during the dissection of the scalp secure it at once, as it pierces the deep
fascia covering the upper end of the trapezius, about midway between the
external occipital protuberance and the posterior border of the mastoid
portion of the temporal bone ; trace it upwards through the dense superficial
fascia of the scalp and clean the branches of the occipital artery which are
distributed in the same region. The smallest occipital nerve will be found
VOL. II—11
in the superficial fascia between the great occipital and the median plane.
It is the medial division of the posterior branch of the third cervical nerve,
and it supplies the skin of the medial and lower part of the posterior portion
of the scalp and the adjacent part of the skin of the back of the neck.
Trace it upwards to its termination and downwards to the point where it
pierces the deep fascia covering the trapezius. At a still lower level look
for the medial divisions of the posterior branches of the other cervical
nerves. They are variable in number and position, but those which are
present will be found piercing the deep fascia over the trapezius, at a short
distance from the median plane, and running downwards and laterally
towards the posterior triangle.
After the cutaneous nerves have been found remove the remains of the
superficial fascia and the deep fascia from the surface of the trapezius.
The Terminal Part of the Great Occipital Nerve.—The
great occipital nerve is the large medial division of the
posterior branch of the second cervical nerve. It enters the
posterior part of the scalp, after piercing the upper part of the
trapezius and the deep fascia of the back of the neck, and
ramifies in the superficial fascia of the scalp over the occipital
bone and the posterior part of the parietal bone, accompanying
the branches of the occipital artery, and communicating with
the great auricular and small occipital nerves.
Arteria Occipitalis.—After emerging from between the
trapezius and the sterno-mastoid, at the apex of the posterior
triangle, or piercing the upper part of the trapezius, the terminal
part of the occipital artery passes through the deep fascia of
the back of the neck and enters the superficial fascia of the
posterior part of the scalp. It anastomoses with its fellow of
the opposite side, and with the posterior auricular and the
superficial temporal arteries. As a rule, it breaks up into two
main branches, a lateral and a medial. The medial branch
gives off cutaneous twigs and a meningeal branch, which passes
through the parietal foramen and anastomoses with a branch
of the middle meningeal artery. Through the same foramen,
passes an emissary vein which connects the occipital veins
with the superior sagittal (longitudinal) sinus.
Musculus Trapezius.—The trapezius and latissimus dorsi
constitute the first layer of the muscles of the back. Only
that part of the trapezius which lies above the level of the
seventh cervical spine belongs to the dissector of the head and
neck; the lower part and the latissimus must be cleaned by
the dissector of the arm, but the dissector of the head should
take the opportunity to revise his knowledge of the whole
origin and insertion of the muscle. It arises from the medial
third of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone,
the external occipital protuberance, the whole length of the
ligamentum nuchae, the seventh cervical spine, the t1ps of
all the thoracic spines and the corresponding supraspinous
ligaments.
In the region of the seventh cervical spine the origin is more aponeurotic
than elsewhere, and the fine tendinous fibres of the muscles of the two sides
form an ovoid aponeurotic area some two inches in length.

F1g. 70.—Superficial dissection of the Back of the Neck.
The upper fibres of the muscle descend in oblique curves
and are inserted into the lateral third of the posterior border
and the adjacent part of the superior surface of the clavicle;
the intermediate fibres run horizontally, towards the shoulder,
and are inserted into the medial border of the acromion and
the upper lip of the posterior border of the spine of the
scapula. The lower fibres ascend, and terminate in a small
11—11 a
HEAD AND NECK
triangular tendon which plays over the smooth triangle at the
root of the scapular spine and is inserted partly into the lower
and partly into the upper lip of the spine. The muscle is
supplied by the accessory and the third and fourth cervical
nerves. It draws the scapula medially and braces the shoulder
backwards, raises the tip of the shoulder, or depresses the
scapula and turns the glenoid fossa upwards according to
whether the intermediate, the upper, or the lower fibres are
mainly in action.
Dissection.—On the second day after the subject has been placed on its
face, the trapezius may be reflected. This must be done in conjunction
with the dissector of the arm. First separate the muscle from the occipital
bone, and then divlde it about half an inch from the spines of the vertebrae.
The muscle can now be raised and thrown laterally towards its insertion.
On its deep surface the accessory nerve, the twigs of supply from the third
and fourth cervical nerves and the superficial cervical artery will be noticed.
It is the duty of the dissector of the upper limb to dissect these, but the
dissector of the head and neck should trace the superficial cervical artery
to its origin from the transversa colli.
The attachments of the levator scapulae also must be defined. Two
twigs from the third and fourth cervical nerves, which lie on its surface
and finally enter its substance, have already been secured. Further,
passing downwards under cover of this muscle, the dorsal scapular nerve
(O.T. nerve to the rhomboids) and the descending branch (O.T. posterior
scapular) of the transversa colli artery will be found. Almost invariably
the dorsal scapular nerve gives one or two twigs to the levator scapulae.
The levator scapulae, the rhomboids, the posterior serrati and the splenius
are classed as muscles of the second layer. The rhomboids and the lower
part of the levator belong to the dissector of the arm ; the remaining muscles
are the property of the dissector of the head and neck.
Musculus Levator Scapulae.—This muscle arises by four
slips from the posterior parts of the transverse processes of
the upper four cervical vertebra. These unite to form an
elongated muscle which extends downwards and posteriorly to
be inserted into that portion of the vertebral border of the
scapula which is placed above the root of the spine. Its
nerve-supply comes from the third and fourth cervical nerves,
and also from the dorsal scapular nerve.
The origin of the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle
may now be examined. It is attached to the upper transverse
ligament of the scapula and the adjacent part of the superior
border of the bone. The transverse scapular artery (O.T.
suprascapular) will be noticed passing over the upper trans-
verse ligament whilst the suprascapular nerve traverses the
notch below it.
The second day's work is now completed, and on the same day the
dissector of the upper limb must finish his share of the dissection of the
back, so as to allow the dissector of the head and neck to begin the
examination of the deeper structures on the dorsal aspect of the trunk.
Three days are allowed for this dissection, and these may be disposed
of in the following manner :—On the first day, all the muscles, fasciae,
nerves, and blood vessels of the back, with the exception of those in
connection with the sub - occipital triangle, should be studied; on the
second day, the sub-occipital triangle must be examined; and on the third
day the medulla spinalis (O.T. spinal cord) must be displayed.
Musculi Serrati Posteriores.—These are two thin sheets
of fleshy fibres, which are placed upon the posterior aspect

F1g. 7r.—Diagram to show the Connections of the Lumbo-dorsal Fascia.
of the thoracic wall. The serratus posterior superior is much
the smaller of the two; it arises by a thin aponeurotic tendon
from the lower part of the ligamentum nuchse; from the spinous
process of the seventh cervical.vertebra; and from the spinous
processes of the upper two or three thoracic vertebra. It
passes obliquely downwards and laterally, and is inserted into
the outer surfaces of the second, third, fourth, and fifth ribs,
a short distance anterior to their angles.
The serratus posterior inferior will be brought into view by
raising and throwing medially that portion of the latissimus
dorsi which the dissector of the upper limb has left attached
to the lumbo-dorsal fascia. It takes origin from the spinous
processes of the last two thoracic and upper two lumbar
HEAD AND NECK
vertebrae, and the supraspinous ligaments between them.
The dissector will note, however, that this is not an indepen-
dent and distinct attachment, but that it is effected through
the medium of the lumbo-dorsal fascia, with which the
aponeurotic tendon of the muscle blends. The muscle
passes upwards and laterally and is inserted into the outer
surfaces of the lower four ribs.
Fascia Lumbo-dorsalis.—On the third day after the body
is placed upon its face the dissector of the head and neck
should associate himself with the dissector of the abdomen
in the examination of the lumbo-dorsal fascia. It is an
aponeurotic layer, thin in the thoracic portion of its extent,
but thick and strong in the lumbar and sacral regions; and
in all these regions it binds down the muscles of the back
to the sides of the spinous processes and to the transverse
processes of the vertebrae.
The Dorsal Part of the Lumbo-dorsal Fascia (O.T. Vertebra^
Aponeurosis).—This part of the lumbo-dorsal fascia is a thin
transparent lamina which extends from the tips of the spines
and the supraspinous ligaments to the angles of the ribs.
At the upper end of the thoracic region it dips beneath the
serratus posterior superior into the neck, and at the lower
end it blends with the aponeurosis of origin of the serratus
posterior inferior, and through that becomes continuous with
the posterior layer of the lumbar portion.
Dissection.—To display the lumbar part of the lumbo-dorsal fascia clear
away the remains of the origin of the Iatissimus dorsi, which springs from
its posterior surface, and then reflect the serratus posterior inferior by
cutting through it at right angles to its fibres and turning it medially and
laterally towards its origin and insertion. As the lateral part is turned
aside secure its nerves of supply, which are derived from the lower inter-
costal nerves, and enter its deep surface. Next remove the remains of the
origin of the serratus posterior inferior, and then the posterior layer of the
lumbar part of the lumbo-dorsal fascia will be completely exposed.
The Lumbar Part of the Lumbo-dorsal Fascia.—This portion
of the lumbo-dorsal fascia is separable into three lamellae, a
posterior, a middle, and an anterior. All three fuse together
laterally, where they become connected with the internal
oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles. The posterior
layer, which is the strongest of the three, is a dense tendinous
aponeurosis. It is continuous above with the thoracic part.
Below, it is attached to the posterior part of the lateral lip of
the iliac crest, and to the dorsum of the sacrum and the coccyx.
Medially, it is attached to the tips of the spines of the lumbar
vertebrae and the sacrum; and laterally it blends with the
posterior surface of the middle lamella (Fig. 71). The
aponeurosis of origin of the latissimus dorsi and the serratus
posterior inferior arise from its posterior surface.
Dissection.—Make a longitudinal incision through the posterior layer of
the lumbar part of the lumbo-dorsal fascia, midway between its medial
and its lateral borders. At each end of the longitudinal incision make a
transverse incision extending from the spine medially to the lateral border
of the rounded mass of spinal muscles lying under cover of the fascia.
Turn the medial part of the divided fascia towards the median plane, and
verify its attachment to the vertebral spines and the supraspinous ligaments.
Pull the lateral part aside, and at the lateral border of the mass of posterior
spinal muscles it will be found to blend with a deeper layer, the middle
lamella. Push the mass of posterior spinal muscles towards the median
plane, and follow the middle lamella of the fascia to its attachment.
The middle lamella is attached medially to the tips of the
transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae; below to the
iliac crest, and above to the last rib. Laterally it blends
with the posterior and anterior lamellae, and immediately
lateral to its line of union with the posterior lamella the
internal oblique arises from its posterior surface. To expose
it thoroughly the mass of posterior spinal muscles must be
pushed medially.
Dissection.—After the middle lamella has been examined divide it
longitudinally, close to its attachment to the tips of the transverse processes,
and transversely along the line of the iliac crest, and turn it laterally. A
considerable part of the posterior surface of the quadratus lumborum
muscle will then be exposed. Displace the lateral border of the quadratus
lumborum towards the median plane, and the anterior lamella of the
lumbar part of the lumbo-dorsal fascia will be brought into view.
The anterior lamella of the lumbar part of the lumbo-
dorsal fascia is attached medially to the anterior surfaces of
the roots of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae;
laterally it blends with the fused middle and posterior lamellae
to form the common aponeurosis of origin of the transversus
abdominis muscle, and it is by means of the three lamellae
of the lumbar fascia that the latter muscle arises from the tips
of the spines, and the tips and the roots of the transverse
processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The upper border of the
anterior lamella becomes thickened, and extends anterior to
the quadratus lumborum from the last rib to the trans-
verse process of the first lumbar vertebra as the arcus
lumbo-costalis lateralis (O.T. external arcuate ligament); the
11—11 b
HEAD AND NECK
lower border blends with the ilio-lumbar ligament. The
dissector should verify these various attachments by passing
his fingers over the posterior surface of the lamella from its
lateral to its medial border, and from its upper to its lower end.
Dissection.—After satisfying himself regarding the lamellae of the lumbar
part of the lumbo-dorsal fascia and their relations to the posterior spinal
muscles, to the quadratus lumborum, and to the internal oblique and the
transversus abdominis muscles, the dissector should make a longitudinal
incision through the anterior lamella, and the peri-renal fascia anterior to it;
and, introducing his finger through the opening into the extra-peritoneal
fatty tissue, he should scrape away the latter until he exposes the kidney,
below the level of the last rib, and the adjacent part of the colon, which
lies along the lower and lateral part of the kidney. After this has been
done he should reflect the serratus posterior superior and secure its nerves
of supply which spring from the upper intercostal nerves and enter its deep
surface; then he should remove the thoracic part of the lumbo-dorsal fascia
and commence the study of the posterior spinal muscles, beginning with
the splenius.
Musculus Splenius.—The splenius has a continuous origin
from the lower half of the ligamentum nuchae, and from the
spines of the seventh cervical and upper six thoracic vertebrae.
Its fibres pass obliquely upwards and laterally, forming a thick
fiat muscle, which soon divides into a cervical and a cranial
portion, termed respectively the splenius cervicis and the
splenius capitis.
The splenius cervicis turns anteriorly and is inserted by
tendinous slips into the tubercles of the transverse processes
of the upper two or three cervical vertebrae, medial to the
levator scapulae.
The splenius capitis passes under cover of the upper part
of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and gains insertion into the
lower part of the mastoid portion of the temporal bone and
into the lateral portion of the superior nuchal line of the
occipital bone. To see this insertion, the sterno-mastoid
muscle may be divided along the superior nuchal line, but
it must not be detached from the temporal bone.
Dissection.—The deeper spinal muscles must now be dissected. Begin
by reflecting the splenius muscle. Detach it from its origin and throw
it laterally and upwards towards its insertion. Whilst doing this, preserve
the cutaneous branches of the cervical nerves which pierce it.
When the splenius capitis is fully reflected, a small triangular space
will be noticed close to the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone.
Anteriorly, it is bounded by the longissimus capitis (O.T. trachelo-mastoid);
posteriorly, by the lateral border of the semispinalis capitis (O.T. com-
plexus); and above, by the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone.
The floor of this little space is formed by the superior oblique muscle of
the head, and it is traversed by the occipital artery, which in this part of
its course gives off its descending branch (O.T. arteria princeps cervicis),
and its meningeal branch.
The Third Layer of Muscles.—Under this head are included a series
of muscular strands which stretch with a greater or less degree of continuity
along the entire length of the dorsal aspect of the vertebral column. In the
lumbar region they constitute a bulky fleshy mass which may be considered
the main starting-point. This mass is the musculus sacro-spinalis which
has the following origins :—(1) from the spines of all the lumbar vertebra;
(2) from the supraspinous ligaments which bind the lumbar spines together;
(3) from the dorsum of the sacrum and from the posterior sacro-iliac liga-
ment; (4) from the posterior fifth of the iliac crest; (5) from the deep
surface of the posterior layer of the lumbo-dorsal fascia. In great part the
superficial surface of this muscular mass is covered by and is adherent to
the posterior layer of the lumbo-dorsal fascia.
Superiorly the sacro-lumbalis divides into three columns. The lateral
column first separates from the general mass, and to it the name of Mo-
costalis is given; the middle column is termed the longissimus, and the
medial column, which becomes quite distinct only as the upper part of the
dorsal region is approached, is called the spinalis. The semispinalis muscle
is also included in the third layer.
The Ilio-costalis is a column of muscular bundles which extends from
the lumbar to the cervical region. It is separable into three segments
known, from below upwards, as the ilio-costalis lumborum, the ilio-costalis
dorsi, and the ilio-costalis cervicis.
Ilio-costalis Lumborum.—This muscle and the longissimus dorsi become
distinct at the level of the last rib, and the interval between them is marked
by the exits of the lateral divisions of the posterior branches of lower
thoracic nerves.
The muscle ends above in a series of six or seren slender tendons, which
are inserted into the angles or the corresponding parts of the lower six or
seven ribs.
The Ilio-costalis Dorsi (O.T. Musculus Accessorius) arises by six or seven
slender tendons from the angles of the lower ribs, on the medial sides of the
tendons of insertion of the ilio-costalis lumborum, and it is inserted by a
series of similar tendons into the angles of the upper six ribs and to the
transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra.
The Ilio-costalis Cervicis (O.T. Cervicalis Ascendens).—This highest
segment of the ilio-costalis arises, on the medial side of the ilio-costalis
dorsi, by four slips which spring from the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs;
it is inserted into the transverse processes of the fourth, fifth, and sixth
cervical vertebrae.
To display the ilio-costalis properly, the dissector should first evert the
lowest segment, and then in turn the middle and upper segments, but
whilst doing this he must take care to preserve the lateral div1sions of the
posterior branches of the spinal nerves.
The Longissimus is the middle and largest of the three muscle columns.
It extends upwards, through the thoracic and cervical regions, to the head,
and it also is separable into three segments: longissimus dorsi, longissimus
cervicis, and longissimus capitis. The interval between the longissimus
and the spinalis is frequently difficult to define, but if the fascia is carefully
cleaned from the lateral to the medial border of the longissimus in the
upper thoracic region, the separation will become apparent, and after it
has been found the attachments of the longissimus must be defined.
Longissimus Dorsi.—The dorsal part of the longissimus possesses two
rows of slips of insertion: a medial row of tendinous slips which are
I 70
HEAD AND NECK
attached to the tips of the transverse processes of the thoracic and the
accessory processes of the lumbar vertebra, and a lateral row of muscular
slips which are inserted into the lower ten ribs, on the lateral sides of their
tubercles, and to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and to
the posterior surface of the middle lamella of the lumbar fascia.
Longissimus Cervicis (O.T. Transversalis Cervicis).—This portion of the
longissimus springs from the transverse processes of the upper four thoracic
vertebra, and is inserted into the posterior tubercles of the transverse
processes of the cervical vertebra from the second to the sixth inclusive.
Longissimus Capitis (O.T. Trachdo-mastoid).—The longissimus capitis
lies in the neck under cover of the splenius. It arises in common with the
longissimus cervicis from the transverse processes of three or four of the upper
thoracic vertebra, and, in addition, from the articular processes of a like
number of the lower cervical vertebra. The narrow fleshy band which results
is inserted into the posterior part of the mastoid portion of the temporal
bone, under cover of the splenius capitis and sterno-mastoid muscles.
The Spinalis. —This is the most medial, shortest, and weakest of the three
columns, and the most difficult to define. Below, it is intimately blended
with the longissimus dorsi, but it may be regarded as taking origin by four
tendons from the spines of the upper two lumbar and lower two thoracic
vertebrae. These end in a small muscular belly, which is inserted by a
series of slips into a very variable number of the upper thoracic spines.
It is closely connected with the subjacent semispinalis dorsi.
Spinalis Cervicis.—This upward prolongation of the spinalis is not
always easy to define. It springs from the spines of the lower four cervical
vertebra and is inserted into the spines of the second, third, and fourth
cervical vertebra.
Dissection.—The occipital artery has already been seen crossing
the apex of the posterior triangle (p. 149), and its terminal branches have
been dissected as they ramify in the scalp (p. 157). The second part of
the vessel, which extends from under shelter of the mastoid process, along
the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, to the point where it pierces
the trapezius to become superficial, can now be exposed fully. To effect
this, the longissimus capitis (O.T. trachelo-mastoid) must be divided a
short distance below its insertion, and, along with the splenius capitis,
thrown upwards as far as possible.
Arteria Occipitalis.—The second part of the occipital
artery is now displayed. In the region of the mastoid process
it is very deeply placed; indeed, no less than five structures
lie superficial to it. These are (enumerating them in order
from the vessel to the surface)—(1) the origin of the posterior
belly of the digastric muscle; (2) the mastoid process; (3)
the longissimus cervicis; (4) the splenius capitis; and (5)
the sterno-mastoid.1 As the artery runs posteriorly, it very
soon emerges from under cover of the first three of these
structures, and a little farther on it leaves the shelter of the
splenius, and is then covered by the sterno-mastoid alone.
Issuing from under cover of the posterior border of that muscle,
1 It is not uncommon to find the artery at this point of its course between
the splenius and the longissimus capitis.
the artery crosses the apex of the posterior triangle, and
disappears under the trapezius, which it finally pierces near
the external occipital protuberance, to reach the scalp. Two
muscles constitute its deep relations—viz., the insertions of
the superior oblique and the semispinalis capitis (O.T.
complexus).
The following branches may be traced from this portion of
the occipital artery : (1) descending (O.T. arteria princeps
cervicis); (2) meningeal; (3) muscular.
The ramus descendens (O.T. arteria princeps cervicis) is a
twig of some size, which passes medially to the lateral border
of the semispinalis capitis (O.T. complexus); there it divides
into a superficial and a deep branch. The former ramifies on
the surface of the semispinalis capitis, whilst the latter sinks
under that muscle, where it will be followed to its anastomosis
with the deep cervical artery at a later stage in the dissection.
The small meningeal branch enters the posterior cranial fossa
through the mastoid foramen, and supplies the dura mater
and cranial wall in this region.
The muscular twigs go to the neighbouring muscles.
The veins corresponding to the occipital artery are two,
or perhaps three, in number. They drain the blood from the
occipital portion of the scalp, and open into the sub-occipital
plexus, which is drained by the vertebral and deep cervical
veins. The most lateral of the occipital veins frequently
communicates with the transverse sinus (O.T. lateral) through
the mastoid foramen.
Dissection. —The semispinalis capitis, which has been exposed by the
reflection of the splenius and the turning aside of the longissimus cervicis
and longissimus capitis, must now be cleaned, and whilst this is being done
and its attachments are being defined, care must be taken of the medial
divisions of the posterior branches of the second, third, fourth, and fifth
cervical nerves. The first of these—or, in other words, the great occipital
—from its great size, runs little risk of injury, but the others are liable to
be overlooked. They all emerge from the substance of the muscle close to
the median plane.
Semispinalis Capitis (O.T. Complexus).—The semispinalis capitis is the
uppermost part of a muscular column consisting of three segments, which
are spoken of collectively as the semispinalis, and individually as the semi-
spinalis dorsi, the semispinalis cervicis, and the semispinalis capitis. It
belongs to the third layer of muscles, of which the greater number have
been dissected already. The two lower segments will be dissected subse-
quently, but it is convenient to examine the semispinalis capitis at once.
It is a thick fleshy mass which springs by tendinous slips from the transverse
processes of the upper six thoracic vertebrae and the articular processes of
the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae. Its massive upper extremity
HEAD AND NECK
is inserted into a somewhat oval area on the occipital bone, between the
superior and inferior nuchal lines close to the external occipital crest. It is
separated from its fellow muscle of the opposite side by the ligamentum
nuchse; and its most medial part, which is to a certain extent distinct from
the general mass, is divided into two bellies by an intermediate tendon and
is frequently spoken of as the biventer cervicis. Occasionally the remainder
of the muscle is also intersected by a tendinous septum.
Dissection.—The semispinalis capitis must now be reflected by detaching
it from the occiput and throwing it laterally. This dissection requires

Vertebral Artery in the Neck.
care, not only on account of the nerves which have been seen to perforate
the muscle to reach the surface, but also on account of the structures
which it covers. In its upper part it lies over the sub-occipital triangle
and the muscles bounding it, whilst below it covers the semispinalis
cervicis. A thick dense fascia is placed over these subjacent parts, and in
this lie certain of the cervical nerves and the anastomosis between the
descending branch of the occipital artery and the arteria profunda cervicis.
The dissector must specially look for a small twig from the posterior
branch of the sub-occipital nerve which enters the deep surface of the upper
part of the semispinalis capitis, and for a larger branch to the same muscle
from the great occipital nerve.
Ligamentum Nuchae (Fig. 72).—This is a strong fibrous
partition placed in the median plane between the muscles on
each side of the back of the neck. It represents a powerful
elastic structure in quadrupeds, which helps to sustain the weight
of the dependent head. In man, however, there is not much
elastic tissue developed in connection with it, and it appears
to be a continuation upwards of the supraspinous ligament
from the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra to the external
occipital protuberance. In shape it is somewhat triangular.
By its base it is attached to the external occipital crest; by
its anterior border it is fixed by a series of slips to the
posterior tubercle of the atlas, and to the bifid spines of the
cervical vertebrae, in the intervals between their tubercles. Its
apex is attached to the spine of the seventh cervical vertebra,
whilst its posterior border is, in a measure, free, and gives
origin to the trapezius, rhomboid, serratus posterior superior,
and splenius muscles.
Arteria Profunda Cervicis.—The deep cervical artery springs
from the costo-cervical branch of the subclavian, and reaches
the dorsum by passing posteriorly between the transverse
process of the last cervical vertebra and the neck of the first
rib. At the present stage of the dissection it is seen ascend-
ing upon the semispinalis cervicis muscle and anastomosing
with the descending branch of the occipital. Both vessels
anastomose with twigs from the vertebral artery.
The arteria profunda cervicis is accompanied by a large
vein—the vena profunda cervicis. This vessel begins in the
sub-occipital plexus, and it ends in the vertebral vein close to
its termination. It reaches this point by turning forwards
under the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra.
Posterior Branches of the Spinal Nerves.—The nerves of
the back must now be examined. They are the posterior
branches of the spinal nerves. With four exceptions (viz.,
the first cervical, fourth and fifth sacral, and the coccygeal
nerves), each posterior division will be found to divide into a
lateral and a medial division.
Examine these nerves successively in the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar
regions. It is well, however, to defer the dissection of the sacral and
coccygeal nerves until the multifidus muscle has been studied.
Cervical Region.—In this region the posterior branches
of the spinal nerves are eight in number. The posterior
branch of the sub-occipital or first nerve fails to divide into a
medial and a lateral division. It lies deeply in the sub-
HEAD AND NECK
occipital triangle, and will be examined when this space is
dissected.
The posterior branch of the second cervical nerve is very
large. It appears between the vertebral arches of the atlas
and epistropheus vertebrae. The posterior branches of the
succeeding six cervical nerves arise from the corresponding
spinal nerve-trunks in the intervertebral foramina. They turn
dorsally on the medial sides of the posterior intertransverse
muscles, and appear in the intervals between the transverse
processes.
The lateral divisions are of small size, and are entirely
devoted to the supply of adjacent muscles.
The medial divisions are not all distributed alike, nor
indeed do they present the same relations. Those from the
second, third, fourth, and fifth nerves run medially towards the
spinous processes, superficial to the semispinalis cervicis
muscle, and under cover of the semispinalis capitis. When
close to the median plane they turn posteriorly, pierce the
semispinalis capitis, splenius, and trapezius muscles, and
become superficial. In their course to the surface they give
numerous twigs to the neighbouring muscles.
The medial division of the second nerve is remarkable for
its large size. It receives the special name of great occipital.
It will be noticed turning round the lower border of the
inferior oblique muscle, to which it supplies some twigs. In
passing to the surface it pierces the semispinalis capitis (O.T.
complexus) and trapezius. To the former it gives several
twigs. The distribution of this nerve on the occiput has
been noticed already (p. 156).
The medial division of the third nerve also sends an offset
to the occipital portion of the scalp (p. 156).
The medial divisions of the lower three posterior branches
of the cervical nerves resemble the preceding, in so far that
they take a course medially towards the spinous processes.
They differ from them, however, in running deep to the semi-
spinalis cervicis, and in being, as a rule, entirely expended
in the supply of muscles.
Dorsal Region.—The posterior branches of the thoracic
nerves make their appearance in the intervals between the
transverse processes. The lateral divisions proceed laterally,
under cover of the longissimus muscle, and appear in the
interval between the longissimus dorsi on the one hand and
the ilio-costalis on the other. The upper six or seven of these
nerves are exhausted in the supply of the middle and lateral
columns of the sacrospinalis; the lower five or six, however,
are considerably larger, and contain both motor and sensory
fibres. After giving up their motor fibres to the muscles,
they become superficial, by piercing the serratus posterior in-
ferior and the latissimus dorsi, in a line with the angles of
the ribs. The cutaneous distribution of these nerves has
already been examined by the dissector of the upper limb.
The medial divisions also are distributed differently in the
upper and lower portions of the dorsal region. The lower
five or six are very small, and end in the multifidus
muscle. The upper six or seven pass medially between the
multifidus and semispinalis, and after supplying the muscles
between which they are situated, they become superficial. In
passing towards the surface they pierce the splenius, rhom-
boids, and trapezius muscles, and thus gain the superficial
fascia, where they have been dissected already.
Lumbar Region.—The medial divisions of the posterior
branches of the five lumbar nerves are small, and, like the
corresponding twigs in the lower dorsal region, they have
a purely muscular distribution. They end in the multifidus.
The lateral divisions sink into the substance of the sacro-
spinalis, and are concerned in the supply of that muscle, and
also of the lumbar intertransverse muscles. The upper three
of these nerves are of large size, and become cutaneous by
piercing the superficial lamella of the lumbo-dorsal fascia.
They have already been traced by the dissector of the lower
limb to the skin of the gluteal region. The lowest lateral
division communicates with the corresponding branch of the
first sacral nerve.
Blood Vessels of the Back.—In the cervical region the
dissector has already noticed the arteria profunda cervicis,
and the descending branch of the second part of the occipital
artery. Deep in the sub-occipital region he will subsequently
meet with a small portion of the vertebral artery. In addition
to these, however, minute twigs may be discovered, in a well-
injected subject, passing posteriorly from the vertebral artery
in the intervals between the transverse processes, and also in
the sub-occipital space. These supply the muscles, and
anastomose with the other arteries in this region.
In the dorsal region the posterior branches of the aortic inter-
costal arteries make their appearance between the transverse
processes. Each of these vessels reaches this point by
passing dorsally in the interval between the body of a vertebra
and the anterior costo-transverse ligament. It is associated
with the corresponding posterior branch of a spinal nerve,
and is distributed with it to the muscles and integument of
the back.
In the lumbar region similar branches are derived from the
lumbar arteries. They are distributed in the same manner.
In both dorsal and lumbar regions these vessels, before
reaching the back, furnish small spinal branches which enter
the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramina.
These will be traced at a later period.
The veins accompanying the dorsal branches of the lumbar
and intercostal arteries pour their blood into the lumbar
and intercostal veins. They are of large size, being joined
by tributaries from the posterior vertebral venous plexus, and
also by others from within the vertebral canal.
Dissection.—The remains of the third layer of spinal muscles must now
be dissected. They are the semispinalis dorsi and semispinalis cervicis.
The semispinalis cervicis is already exposed; but to display the
semispinalis dorsi it is necessary to remove the spinalis dorsi muscle.
The semispinalis dorsi is composed of a series of muscular slips, with
long tendons at either end, which arise from the transverse processes of the
sixth to the tenth thoracic vertebra. It is inserted into the spines of the
upper four thoracic and lower two cervical vertebrae. The semispinalis
cervicis lies under cover of the semispinalis capitis. It springs from the
transverse processes of the upper five thoracic vertebrae, and is inserted into
the spines of the second to the fifth cervical vertebrae. The slips composing
the semispinalis muscles stretch over five or more vertebrae.
Dissection.—The fourth layer of muscles must now be examined. It
includes the multifidus, the rotatores, the interspinals, theintertransversales,
and the recti and oblique muscles of the sub-occipital region. The latter have
already been exposed by the reflection of the semispinalis capitis (complexus).
To display the other members of the group the semispinalis dorsi and
cervicis must be detached from the spines and drawn aside, and the
sacrospinalis must be separated from the lumbar and sacral spines and
turned laterally, if this has not already been done in tracing the nerves.
Musculus Multifidus.—In the lumbar and sacral regions the multi-
fidus will be seen to constitute a thick fleshy mass, which clings closely
to the vertebral spines. In this situation it has a very extensive origin—
viz., (1) from the deep surface of the aponeurotic origin of the sacrospinalis;
(2) from the posterior surface of the sacrum as low as the fourth aperture;
(3) from the posterior sacro-iliac ligament; (4) from the posterior superior
spine of the ilium; and (5) from the mammillary processes of the lumbar
vertebrae. In the thoracic region it takes origin from the transverse processes
of the vertebrae, and in the cervical region from the articular processes of at
least four of the lower cervical vertebrae. The bundles which compose the
multifidus pass over two, three, or four vertebrae, and are inserted into the
whole length of the various spinous processes of the movable vertebrae as
high up as the epistropheus (O.T. axis).
Musculi Rotatores.—These are a series of small muscles which may be
exposed by raising the multifidus. In the dorsal region each muscle springs
from the root of a transverse process, and is inserted into the lamina of the
vertebra immediately above, close to the root of the spinous process.
Somewhat similar muscles have been described in the cervical and lumbar
regions, and also a series of longer and more superficial slips which connect
alternate vertebrae with each other.
Musculi Interspinals and Intertransversaxii. — The interspinous
muscles can hardly be said to exist in the dorsal region, except in its upper
and lower parts, where they are present in a rudimentary condition. In
the neck they are arranged in pairs, occupying each interspinous interval,
with the exception of that between the epistropheus and atlas. In the
lumbar region also they are well marked and in pairs: here they are
attached to the whole length of the spinous processes. The intertransverse
muscles are strongly developed in the lumbar region, and occupy the entire
length of the intertransverse intervals. Additional rounded fasciculi may
be observed passing between the accessory processes. These are termed
the interaccessorii. In the dorsal region intertransverse muscles—poorly
developed—are found only in the lower three or four spaces. In the cervical
region they are present in pairs and will be examined subsequently.
Levatores Costarum.—These constitute a series of twelve
fan-shaped muscles, which are classified as muscles of the thorax,
but they are exposed when the longissimus and ilio-costalis
are removed, and therefore should be examined now. They
pass from the transverse processes to the ribs. The first
muscle of the series springs from the tip of the transverse
process of the last cervical vertebra, and, expanding as
it proceeds downwards and laterally, it is inserted into the
outer border of the first rib, immediately beyond the
tubercle. Each of the succeeding muscles takes origin from
the tip of a thoracic transverse process, and is inserted into
the outer surface of the rib immediately below, along a line
extending from the tubercle to the angle.
Posterior Branches of the Sacral Nerves.—These are
very small. The upper four will be found emerging from
the posterior sacral foramina; the fifth appears at the lower
end of the sacral canal.
To expose the upper three the multifidus covering the
upper three sacral apertures must be carefully removed.
Each of these three nerves will be found to divide in
the usual manner into a medial and lateral division.
The medial divisions are very fine, and end in the
multifidus.
The lateral divisions are somewhat larger, and join
vol. 11—12
HEAD AND NECK
together so as to form a looped plexus upon the dorsum of the
sacrum. This communicates above with the lateral division
of the last lumbar nerve and below with the posterior branch
of the fourth sacral nerve. Branches proceed from the loops
to the surface of the sacro-tuberous ligament (O.T. great sacro-
sciatic). Finally they become superficial by piercing the
glutaeus maximus muscle, and they supply a limited area of
skin over the glutaeal region. They have already been
examined by the dissector of the lower limb.
The lowest two posterior branches of the sacral nerves
do not separate into medial and lateral divisions. They
are very small, and, after communicating with each other,
and also with the coccygeal nerve, they distribute filaments to
the parts on the posterior aspect of the lower portion of the
sacrum and on the dorsal aspect of the coccyx.
Twigs from the lateral sacral artery accompany the sacral
nerves and anastomose with twigs from the glutseal arteries.
Posterior Branch of the Coccygeal Nerve.—This is a
slender twig which emerges from the inferior opening of the
sacral canal, and, after being joined by a filament from the
last sacral nerve, is distributed on the dorsum of the coccyx.
Posterior Vertebral Venous Plexus.—A plexus of veins is
situated upon the superficial aspect of the vertebral arches
subjacent to the multifidus muscle. This plexus collects
blood from the integument and muscles of the back, and
in the thoracic and lumbar regions pours it into the posterior
tributaries of the intercostal and lumbar veins. In the neck
it is especially well marked, and its blood is emptied into the
vertebral veins. Not many of these venous channels will be
seen in an ordinary dissection. They are, however, a source
of serious trouble during operations upon the vertebrae.
Dissection.—The fourth day after the body is placed upon its face
must be devoted to the dissection of the sub-occipital triangle, and the
fifth day to the display of the medulla spinalis (O.T. spinal cord), its
membranes, nerve-roots, and blood vessels.
If the dissector is pushed for time, it is better that he should proceed at
once to expose the spinal medulla, and defer the dissection of the sub-
occipital region until the head and neck have been removed from the body.
Sub-Occipital Space.—The sub-occipital space is a small
triangular area, exposed by the reflection of the semi-
spinalis capitis (O.T. complexus) and the splenius muscle.
It is bounded by three muscles — (1) the rectus capitis
179
posterior major form s its upper and medial boundary;
(2) the obliquus inferior limits it below; and (3) the obliquus
superior bounds it above and to the lateral side. Its
floor consists of two structures—viz. the posterior arch of
the atlas and the thin posterior atlanto-occipital membrane.

F1g. 73.—Dissection of the Sub-occipital Region. Note that in this specimen
the occipital artery is superhcial to the longissimus capitis muscle.
It contains a portion of the vertebral artery and the posterior
branch of the sub-occipital or first cervical nerve.
Dissection.—Before cleaning the muscles bounding the triangle, the
posterior branch of the sub-occipital nerve must be secured. This can
best be done by tracing into the space the minute twig which it has been
seen to give to the deep surface of the semispinalis capitis, or, if this has
II—12 a
HEAD AND NECK
not been retained, by endeavouring to find the twig which it gives to the
rectus capitis posterior major. The tissue in which the nerve lies is very
dense, and the dissection is in consequence somewhat difficult.
Rectus Capitis Posterior Major.—This muscle springs by a
pointed origin from the spine of the epistropheus (O.T. axis),
and, expanding as it passes upwards and laterally, it is inserted
into the occipital bone along the lateral portion of the inferior
nuchal line and the surface immediately below.
Rectus Capitis Posterior Minor.—This is a small fan-
shaped muscle, placed to the medial side of, and overlapped
by, the preceding muscle. It takes origin from the tubercle
on the posterior arch of the atlas, and is inserted into the
medial part of the inferior nuchal line of the occipital bone
and the surface between this and the foramen magnum.
Obliquus Capitis Inferior.—This muscle extends from the
extremity of the spine of the epistropheus to the posterior
border of the transverse process of the atlas. The great
occipital nerve will be seen hooking round its lower border.
Obliquus Capitis Superior.—This muscle springs from
the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into
the occipital bone in the interval between the nuchal lines,
below and to the lateral side of the semispinalis capitis.
Posterior Branch of the Sub-Occipital Nerve. — The
posterior branch of the sub-occipital nerve does not divide
into medial and lateral divisions. It enters the sub-occipital
triangle by passing dorsally, between the posterior arch of
the atlas and the vertebral artery, and at once breaks up
into branches which go to supply five muscles—viz. the two
posterior recti, the two oblique muscles, and the semispinalis
capitis. In addition to these muscular twigs it gives a com-
municating, and sometimes a cutaneous filament.
The communicating branch generally proceeds from the
nerve to the obliquus capitis inferior, and joins the great
occipital nerve. The cutaneous branch, when present, accom-
panies the occipital artery to the integument over the occiput.
Arteria Vertebralis.—Only the third portion of this vessel
lies in the sub-occipital triangle. Emerging from the foramen
in the transverse process of the atlas, it runs posteriorly and
medially in the groove upon the posterior arch of the same
bone. In this course it lies immediately posterior to the lateral
mass of the atlas and above the sub-occipital nerve. It leaves
the space by passing anterior to the thickened lateral ex-
tension of the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane, which
runs from the posterior arch of the atlas to the posterior lip
of its articular process and is called the oblique ligament
of the atlas; then it pierces the dura mater and enters the
vertebral canal.
Small branches proceed from the vertebral artery in this
situation to supply the parts in its immediate neighbourhood,
and to anastomose with the descending branch of the occipital
artery and the arteria profunda cervicis.
Dissection to open the Vertebral Canal.—The first step consists in
thoroughly cleaning the laminae and spinous processes upon both sides.
The multifidus must be completely removed from the dorsum of the
sacrum. At the same time the posterior branches of the nerves must
be retained, so that their continuity with the various spinal nerve-trunks
may be afterwards established. The posterior wall of the vertebral canal
should now be removed in one piece by sawing through the laminae on
either side, and dividing the ligamenta flava, from the third cervical
vertebra down to the lower opening of the canal on the back of the sacrum.
In making this dissection the student must attend to the following
points :—(I) the cut should be directed through the laminae close to the
medial sides of the articular processes ; (2) the saw must be used in an oblique
plane, so that the cut through the lamina e slants slightly medialwards;
(3) in cutting through the cervical laminae the head and neck should hang
over the end of the table, and be flexed as much as possible, whilst the
saw is worked from below upwards; (4) in the case of the lumbar region,
where, indeed, most difficulty will be met, a high block must be placed
under the abdomen of the subject, whilst the blocks supporting the chest
and pelvis are removed. It will probably be necessary at this point to
have recourse to the hammer and chisel.
The laminae and spinous processes which are thus removed are connected
with each other by the ligamenta flava and the supraspinous and inter-
spinous ligaments. They should be laid aside for the present. A de-
scription of these ligaments will be found on p. 358. When the specimen
is fresh, however, the dissector should test the high elasticity of the
ligamenta flava by stretching the specimen.
Between the dura mater and the walls of the canal, the dissector will
notice a quantity of loose areolar tissue and soft fat. The latter is
especially plentiful in the sacral region, where it somewhat resembles the
marrow in the medullary cavity of a long bone. Great numbers of large
veins and minute arteries ramify in this areolo-fatty material.
Arteriae Spinales.—In a well-injected subject a minute
spinal artery will be seen entering the vertebral canal through
each intervertebral foramen. These arteries are derived from
different sources in the different regions of the spine. In the
cervical region they come from the vertebral artery, and in
the thoracic region from the posterior branches of the inter-
costal arteries; in the lumbar region from the dorsal branches
of the lumbar arteries. They supply the spinal medulla and its
II—12 6
HEAD AND NECK
meninges, the bones, the periosteum, and the ligaments; and
their arrangement is very much the same in each of the
three regions.
Each spinal artery may be looked upon as giving off three
main twigs: of these, one, termed the pre-laminar branch,
a very small twig, ramifies upon the deep surface of the
vertebral arches and ligamenta flava; another, the neural
branch, can be followed to the dura mater, which it pierces
immediately above the point of exit of the corresponding
spinal nerve; whilst the third, the post-central branch, is carried
medially, anterior to the dura mater, towards the posterior
surface of the vertebral bodies, and divides into an ascending
and a descending twig. These anastomose with the correspond-
ing twigs above and below, and in this manner a continuous
series of minute arterial arcades is formed, from which
branches pass medially to form a series of cross anastomoses
with the corresponding vessels of the opposite side.
In the cervical region small branches from the ascending
cervical artery also find their way into the vertebral canal;
whilst in the sacral portion of the canal the dissector will find
branches from the lateral sacral arteries.
Internal Vertebral Venous Plexus.—This plexus extends
along the whole length of the vertebral canal, and consists
essentially of four subsidiary longitudinal plexuses, two
anterior and two posterior, which anastomose freely with
each other.
The posterior plexuses are united by many cross branches,
which run along the deep aspect of the vertebral arches and
ligamenta flava. Above, they communicate with the occipital
sinus, whilst all the way down they are connected with the
posterior vertebral venous plexus by wide channels which pierce
the ligamenta flava. Laterally they send branches through
the intervertebral foramina to join the posterior branches of
the intercostal and lumbar veins.
The anterior plexuses cannot be dissected whilst the medulla
spinalis (O.T. spinal cord) and its membranes are in situ, but
it is convenient to describe them at this stage. Indeed, the
dissection is one of considerable difficulty, even under the
most advantageous circumstances. They form two main
longitudinal venous channels placed one upon either side of
the posterior longitudinal ligament of the vertebral bodies, and
they are joined by transverse branches which cross the median
plane anterior to that ligament opposite each vertebral body.
Each transverse vein receives large tributaries from the in-
terior of the vertebra. Superiorly, each of the main longitudinal
channels communicates with the occipital sinus or the basilar
plexus within the cranium; and each of the posterior channels
gives off a branch which emerges above the posterior arch of
the atlas to join the commencement of the vertebral vein.
Opposite the various intervertebral fibro-cartilages the anterior
plexus sends off _ branches which run towards the inter-
vertebral foramina, where they join with corresponding branches
of the posterior plexus, to form the intervertebral veins which
accompany the corresponding spinal nerves.
Meninges of the Medulla Spinalis (Fig. 74).—The medulla
spinalis, like the brain, with which it is continuous, is enveloped
by three membranes termed meninges. The most external
investment is a strong fibrous membrane called the dura
mater; the second, in order from without inwards, is a non-
vascular tunic termed the arachnoid; whilst the third and
most internal is the pia mater. These membranes are
directly continuous with the corresponding investments of
the brain.
Dissection. —The outer surface of the dura mater must now be cleaned.
This is effected by removing the loose areolar tissue, soft fat, and posterior
intraspinal veins from the vertebral canal. It is necessary, also, to define
carefully the numerous lateral prolongations which the membrane gives to
the spinal nerves.
Dura Mater Spinalis (Fig. 74).—In the vertebral canal the
dura mater constitutes an exceedingly dense and tough fibrous
tube, which extends from the foramen magnum above, to the
level of the second or third piece of the sacrum below. It is
separated from the walls of the vertebral canal and its lining
periosteum by an interval, which is filled by loose fat and areolar
tissue, and the internal vertebral venous plexus. Even
before the membranous tube is laid open, the dissector can
readily satisfy himself that it forms a very loose sheath around
the spinal medulla and the nerve-roots which form the cauda
equina; in other words, it is very capacious in comparison
with the volume of its contents. Its calibre, moreover, is by
no means uniform; in the cervical and lumbar regions it is
considerably wider than in the thoracic region, whilst in the
sacral canal it rapidly contracts and finally ends by blending
with the filum terminale, a fibrous thread which is prolonged
11—12 c
downwards through the sacral canal from the extremity of the
medulla spinalis (O.T. spinal cord).
The cylindrical tube of spinal dura mater does not lie
free within the vertebral canal, although its attachments are
of such a nature that they do not in any way interfere with
the free movement of the vertebral column. Above, the dura
mater is firmly attached to the second and third cervical

vertebrae, and around the margin of the foramen magnum;
below, the filum terminale, on which it terminates, can be
traced as far as the dorsal aspect of the coccyx, where it is
lost by blending with the periosteum. On either side the
spinal nerve-roots, as they pierce the dura mater, carry with
them into the intervertebral foramina tubular sheaths of the
membrane, which are attached to the margins of the foramina,
whilst, anteriorly, loose fibrous prolongations—more numerous
above and below than in the dorsal region—connect the tube
of dura mater to the posterior longitudinal ligament of the
vertebral column. No connection of any kind exists between
the dura mater and the vertebral arches or ligamenta flava.
Dissection.—The tube of dura mater may now be opened with the
scissors. The incision should be carried through the membrane in the
median plane. Care, however, must be taken not to injure the delicate
arachnoid, which is subjacent.
Cavum Subdurale.—The subdural cave (O.T. space) is the
capillary interval between the dura mater and the arachnoid
(Fig. 74). The deep surface of the dura, which is turned
towards this space, is smooth, moist, and polished. The
dissector will notice, upon either side, the series of apertures
of exit for the roots of the spinal nerves. These are ranged
in pairs opposite each intervertebral foramen. The subdural
space is prolonged laterally, for a short distance, upon each
of the nerve-roots, and has a free communication with the
lymph paths present in the nerves.
Viewed from the inside of the tube of dura mater, each of the two
nerve-roots belonging to a spinal nerve is seen to carry with it a special
and distinct sheath. When examined, however, on the outside of the tube
of dura mater, they appear to be enveloped in one sheath, because the two
sheaths are closely held together on the outside by intervening connective
tissue, which can be removed with a little careful dissection. When this is
done, the two tubular sheaths will be seen to remain distinct as far as the
ganglion on the posterior root of the nerve. At that point they blend
with each other.
Arachnoidea Spinalis (Fig. 74).—The arachnoid resembles
the dura mater in forming a loose, wide investment for
the spinal medulla. Unlike the dura, however, it is remark-
able for its great delicacy and transparency. The sac which
it forms is most capacious, and can be demonstrated most
easily towards its lower part, where it envelops the extremity
of the spinal medulla and the collection of long nerve-roots
which constitute the cauda equina. Make an incision into it,
and insert the handle of the scalpel, or, better still, inflate the
sac with air by means of a blowpipe. Above, the arachnoid
becomes continuous, at the level of the foramen magnum, with
the arachnoid membrane of the brain, whilst, laterally, it is
prolonged upon the various nerve-roots, thus contributing
to each a tubular sheath. It terminates blindly below at the
level of the second or third sacral vertebra.
Cavum Subarachnoideale (Fig. 74).—This term is applied
to the wide space between the arachnoid and pia mater. It
is occupied by a variable amount of cerebro-spinal fluid, and
HEAD AND NECK
is directly continuous with the cranial sub-arachnoid space.
Three incomplete septa partially subdivide the spinal sub-
arachnoid space into compartments. One of these septa is a
median partition called the septum subarachnoideale, which con-
nects the pia mater covering the posterior aspect of the spinal
medulla with the arachnoid. In the upper part of the cervical
region the subarachnoid septum is represented merely by a
number of strands passing between the two membranes; in the
lower part of the cervical region and in the thoracic region it is
almost complete. The two other septa are formed by the liga-
menta denticulata. These spread outwards from each side of
the medulla spinalis, and will be studied with the pia mater.
Dissection.—Take away the arachnoid mater from a portion of the spinal
medulla, and proceed to the study of the pia mater.
Pia Mater Spinalis.—This is a firm vascular membrane,
closely adherent to the surface of the medulla spinalis (O.T.
spinal cord). It is thicker and denser than the pia mater
of the brain, largely owing to the addition of an outer layer
of fibres which run chiefly in a longitudinal direction. The
pia mater sends a fold into the antero-median fissure of the
medulla spinalis, and the septum which occupies the posterior
median fissure of the medulla spinalis is firmly attached to
its deep surface. Anteriorly, in the median plane, the pia
mater is thickened to form a longitudinal glistening band,
which receives the name of the linea splendens. Of course,
this can be seen only after the medulla spinalis (O.T. spinal
cord) has been removed from the vertebral canal. The blood
vessels of the medulla spinalis lie between the two layers of the
pia mater before they enter the substance of the spinal medulla,
and the various spinal nerves receive from it closely fitting
sheaths which blend with their connective-tissue sheaths.
Ligamentum Denticulatum (Figs. 74 and 75).—This is a
remarkable band, which stretches laterally from either side
of the medulla spinalis, and connects it with the dura mater.
Its pial or medial attachment extends in a continuous line,
between the anterior and posterior nerve-roots, from the level
of foramen magnum above to the level of the body of the first
lumbar vertebra below. Its lateral margin is widely serrated or
denticulated. From twenty to twenty-two denticulations may
be recognised, and the highest is attached to the margin of
the foramen magnum. They occur in the intervals between the
spinal nerves, and, pushing the arachnoid before them, they
are attached by their pointed extremities to the inner surface
of the dura mater.
The ligamenta denticulata maintain the medulla spinalis
(O.T. spinal cord) in the middle of the tube of dura mater and
partially subdivide the sub-arachnoid space into an anterior
and a posterior compartment. In the anterior compartment
the anterior nerve-roots pass laterally; the posterior compart-
ment contains the posterior nerve-roots, and is imperfectly
subdivided into two lateral subdivisions by the septum
posticum.
Medulla Spinalis
(O.T. Spinal Cord).
—The spinal medulla
itself may now be
studied in situ. It is
a cylindrical structure,
slightly flattened an-
teriorly and pos-
teriorly, which extends
from the foramen
magnum, where it is
continuous with the
medulla oblongata of
the brain, to the
lower border of the
body of the first or
the upper border of the body of the second lumbar vertebra.
Its lower end rapidly tapers to a point, and is termed the
conus medullaris. From the extremity of this, a slender fila-
ment, termed the filum terminale, is prolonged downwards to
the dorsal surface of the coccyx.
In the female the average length of the medulla spinalis is
43 cm.; in the male it is 45 cm.
Throughout the greater part of the thoracic region of the
spine the medulla spinalis presents a uniform girth, but in the
cervical and lower thoracic regions it shows marked swellings,
termed respectively the intumescentia cervicalis and intumescentia
lumbalis. From these enlargements proceed the nerves which
supply the upper and lower limbs. The cervical swelling is the
more evident of the two. It begins at the upper end of the
medulla spinalis (O.T. spinal cord) and attains its greatest

breadth (13 to 14 mm.) opposite the fifth or sixth cervical
vertebra. Below, it subsides opposite the second thoracic
vertebra. The lumbar swelling begins at the level of the tenth
thoracic vertebra, and attains its maximum transverse diameter
(11 to 13 mm.) opposite the last thoracic vertebra. Below, it
rapidly tapers into the
conus medullaris.
Filum Terminate.—
This delicate thread-like
filament lies amidst the
numerous long nerve-roots
which occupy the lower
part of the vertebral canal,
but it can readily be de-
tected from these (1) by
its silvery glistening ap-
pearance, and (2) by its
continuity with the ex-
tremity of the conus
medullaris.
Although the central
canal of the medulla
spinalis is prolonged
down in its interior
for nearly half its
length, and nervous
elements can be
traced in its sub-
stance for a like
distance, the filum
terminale is chiefly
composed of pia
mater. The linea

ligamenta denticulata may also be considered to be continued
into it. At the level of the second or third sacral vertebra
it pierces the tapered end of the tube of dura mater, and
receives an investment from it; and, finally, reaching the lower
end of the sacral canal, it terminates by blending with the
periosteum on the dorsal surface of the coccyx or the last
piece of the sacrum.
In length it measures about six inches. The part within
the tube of dura is termed the filum terminale internum, the
portion outside is the filum terminale externum.
Spinal Nerves.—Thirty-one spinal nerves take origin from
each side of the medulla spinalis (O.T. spinal cord). These
are classified into five groups, according to the vertebrae with
which they are associated. The thoracic, lumbar, and sacral
nerves correspond in number with the vertebrae in each of
those regions—thus, there are twelve thoracic, five lumbar,
and five sacral nerves, each of which issues from the vertebral
canal below the vertebra with which it numerically corresponds.
In the cervical region, however, there are eight nerves, the
first of which comes out between the occiput and the atlas,
and is therefore distinguished by the special name of the sub-
occipital nerve. There is only one coccygeal nerve on each
side.
Spinal Nerve-Roots (Figs. 75 and 77).—Each spinal nerve
springs from the side of the spinal medulla by two roots—an
anterior and a posterior. Except in the case of the sub-occipital
nerve (where the posterior root is sometimes absent), the
posterior nerve-root is the larger of the two. In addition,
the posterior root is distinguished by possessing an oval
ganglion, termed the spinal ganglion. There is, also, a
wide physiological difference between the two roots—the
posterior root is composed of afferent fibres, the anterior root
consists of efferent f1bres. Immediately beyond the ganglion
the two roots unite to form the spinal nerve-trunk, which
contains a mixture of both efferent and afferent nerve-fibres.
The mode of attachment of the two nerve-roots to the side of
the medulla spinalis is somewhat different in the two cases.
In each instance they are attached by several separate fila
radicularia, which spread out from each other as they approach
their attachments. In the case of the posterior root the
fila enter the spinal medulla consecutively along a continuous
straight line and at the bottom of a slight furrow. The fila
of the anterior root, on the other hand, are not so regularly
placed. They emerge from the medulla spinalis over an area
of some breadth. The portion of the medulla spinalis which
stands in connection with a pair of nerves receives the
name of a "neural segment."
It will be noted that the size of the nerve-roots differs greatly.
The lower lumbar and upper sacral nerve-roots are much
the larger, whilst the lower sacral and the coccygeal roots
are the smaller. In the cervical region the roots increase in
size from above downwards, but more rapidly in the lower
members of the group; in the thoracic region the roots of the
first nerve are large, but those which succeed it are small and
of uniform size.
In relative length, and in the direction which they follow in
the vertebral canal, the nerve-roots also show great differences.
This is due to the medulla spinalis being so much shorter than
the canal in which it lies. In the upper part of the cervical
region the nerve-roots are short, and proceed laterally in a
more or less horizontal direction. Below the upper cervical

region the nerve-roots become more oblique, and the lower
the origin of the nerve the longer is its course in the canal.
The arrangement of the lower thoracic, the lumbar, sacral, and
coccygeal nerve-roots is particularly characteristic. They are
exceedingly long, and descend vertically from the lower
portion of the medulla spinalis, forming a bundle which is
called the cauda equina.
Mode of Exit of Spinal Nerves from Vertebral Canal.—
The lower six cervical nerves, the thoracic nerves, and the
lumbar nerves make their exit through the intervertebral
foramina; whilst each of the two branches of the upper four
sacral nerves finds its way out by a sacral foramen. The
upper two cervical nerves, the fifth sacral nerve, and the
coccygeal nerve, however, follow a different course. The
sub-occipital emerges by passing over the posterior arch of
the atlas, and the second cervical nerve by passing over the
vertebral arch of the epistropheus (O.T. axis). The fifth
sacral and the coccygeal nerve leave the sacral canal through
its lower aperture (Fig. 78).
Dissection.—The nerve-roots of one or two spinal nerves in each
region should be followed into the corresponding intervertebral foramina.

F1g. 78.—The Sacral Nerve-roots (lower part of Cauda Equina) and the
Membranes in relation to them. (After Testut.) The posterior wall of
Sacral Canal is removed.
This can be easily done by snipping away the articular processes with the
bone-forceps. The position of the ganglion" on the posterior root, the
connections of the sheath of dura mater, the union of the two roots to form
the spinal nerve-trunk, and the division of the latter into the anterior
and posterior branches can thus be studied. An attempt should also
be made at the same time to discover the minute ramus meningeus.
This is a fine twig which is formed by the union of a small filament from
the spinal nerve-trunk with a minute branch from the sympathetic trunk.
HEAD AND NECK
It takes a recurrent course through the intervertebral foramen to end in
the bones and periosteum of the vertebral canal.
Ganglia Spinalia.—These ganglia are oval swellings de-
veloped upon the posterior nerve-roots, just before they unite
with the anterior roots to form the spinal nerve-trunks. They
are found upon the posterior roots of all the nerves, except,
occasionally, upon those of the sub-occipital and the coccygeal
nerves.
The spinal ganglia are formed upon the posterior nerve-
roots as they lie in the intervertebral foramina, except in the
cases of the first two cervical and the sacral and coccygeal
nerves. The ganglia of the first two cervical nerves lie upon
the posterior arch of the first and the vertebral arch of the
second cervical vertebrae respectively; the ganglia of the
sacral nerves are placed within the sacral canal, but out-
side the tube of dura mater. The ganglion on the posterior
root of the coccygeal nerve is inside the tube of dura mater.
Spinal Nerve-Trunks.—These are formed by the union
of the anterior and posterior nerve-roots immediately beyond
the spinal ganglia. This union takes place in the case of the
coccygeal and sacral nerves in the sacral canal; in the
lumbar, thoracic, and lower six cervical nerves, in the inter-
vertebral foramina; and in the case of the first two cervical
nerves, on the arches of the atlas and epistropheus.
The nerve-trunk is exceedingly short; indeed, it divides
almost immediately into its anterior and posterior branches. In
the case of the sacral and coccygeal nerves, this subdivision
takes place in the sacral canal, and the spinal nerve-trunks
of these nerves are distinctly longer than in the case of the
nerves which occupy a higher level.
The distribution of the posterior branches has already
been examined (p. 173).
Dissection.—At this stage the dissector may adopt one of two methods
in the further treatment of the medulla spinalis and the nerves which spring
from it. If the medulla spinalis is fresh and in such a condition that it may be
successfully hardened, it is best to transfer it at once to the preservative fluid.
If, on the other hand, it is soft and not fit for proper preservation, it should
be removed with all its membranes and nerve-roots, and placed in a cork-
lined tray filled with water. There is no method by which the arachnoid,
the pia mater, the ligamenta denticulata, and the nerve-roots can be so
well studied as this.
In removing the medulla spinalis, the spinal nerves should be divided as
they lie in the intervertebral foramina, and in such a manner that as
long a piece as possible of each nerve remains attached to the dura
mater and the spinal medulla. Wherever it is possible the ganglia should
be taken with the nerves. The same rule applies to the sacral nerves also.
The medulla spinalis and its membranes should then be cut across at the
highest limit of the vertebral dissection. By pulling upon the dura mater
the whole specimen may now be lifted from the vertebral canal and trans-
ferred to the water-bath. The dura mater should then be slit down
the median plane, and the edges of the incision must be turned aside.
By fixing the dura mater with pins to the cork at the bottom of the tray,
the further dissection can be conducted with great advantage.
Arteries of the Medulla Spinalis (O.T. Spinal Cord).—It
is only when the arterial injection is particularly good that
the spinal arteries can be made out satisfactorily.
A large number of small arteries are supplied to -the
medulla spinalis. These are the anterior and posterior spinal
arteries which spring from the vertebral in the cranium, and
a series of lateral spinal arteries which reach the side of the
medulla spinalis and are derived from different sources in
each region. In the neck they come from the vertebral,
ascending cervical, and deep cervical arteries; and in the
thoracic and lumbar regions from the posterior branches of
the intercostal and lumbar arteries. By the anastomoses of
these arterial twigs, five longitudinal trunks are formed upon
the surface of the medulla spinalis. One of these lies in
the median plane anteriorly, and may be termed the antero-
median artery. The other four are placed in relation to the
sulci along which the posterior nerve-roots enter the medulla
spinalis. One runs downwards anterior to the line of entrance
of these roots, and the other posterior to it on each side of
the medulla spinalis. These slender arterial trunks may there-
fore be termed the postero-lateral longitudinal vessels.
The antero-median vessel is formed above by the union of the two
anterior spinal branches of the vertebral arteries. One of these is larger
than the other, and takes a much greater share in the formation of the
median trunk. Below the level of the fifth pair of cervical nerves the
continuity of the median vessel depends upon the reinforcements which
it obtains from the lateral spinal vessels. The number of lateral spinal
arteries which join the median vessel is very variable. The majority
of these arteries end on the nerve-roots; only five to ten reach the median
vessel. The antero-median artery runs downwards, under cover of the
linea splendens of the pia mater. Its calibre is uniform throughout,
and where the medulla spinalis ends it proceeds onwards for some distance
upon the filum terminale.
The postero-lateral arteries on each side of the medulla spinalis are formed
in the upper part of the cervical region by the bifurcation of the corre-
sponding posterior spinal branch of the vertebral artery. Lower down
their continuity is maintained by twigs which reach them on the posterior
roots of the spinal nerves from the lateral spinal arteries. It may be
VOL. II—13
HEAD AND NECK
regarded as a rule, that where a lateral spinal artery gives a branch to
one of the postero-lateral arterial trunks, it does not furnish another
to the antero median arterial trunk. In this way different lateral spinal
arteries are in connection with the longitudinal trunks on the anterior
and posterior aspects of the medulla spinalis. The postero-lateral vessels
end at the lower extremity of the medulla spinalis.
From the five main arterial channels which thus extend along the spinal
medulla numerous anastomosing twigs ramify in the pia mater.
Veins of the Medulla Spinalis.—These veins are small and
numerous, and their disposition cannot be said to correspond
with that of the arteries. They are very tortuous, and form
a plexus with elongated meshes. Six more or less perfect
longitudinal venous trunks may be noticed on the surface of
the medulla spinalis in connection with this plexus; two of
these are median, and are placed respectively on the anterior
and posterior aspects. The anterior trunk runs upwards
under cover of the antero-median spinal artery. The other
four are lateral, and are situated two on either side, in
relation, respectively, to the anterior and posterior nerve-roots.
Upon each side, the veins of the medulla spinalis effect
communications with the veins in the vertebral canal by means
of small twigs which run laterally on the nerve-roots.
How to distinguish the anterior from the posterior surface of
the medulla spinalis.

3. Anterior nerve - roots smaller

1. The postero-lateral arteries in
relation to the posterior nerve-

nerve-roots entering the medulla
spinalis along a straight and
continuous line, and at the
bottom of a distinct sulcus.
3. Posterior nerve-roots larger than
the anterior, and provided with
ganglia.
Preservation of the Medulla Spinalis.—If the medulla spinalis is in a
fit state for preservation, it should be immersed for a few weeks in
methylated spirit, to which a small amount (4 per cent) of formalin has been
added. When sufficiently firm, the dissector should endeavour to learn
something of its internal structure by making transverse sections across
it at different levels, and inspecting the cut surface closely with the naked
eye, or with the aid of a magnifying glass.
Internal Structure of the Medulla Spinalis.—A good deal
can be learned by a naked-eye inspection of cross sections of
the medulla spinalis made in different regions and at different
levels.
In such sections the aniero-median fissure and the postero-
median septum and sulcus, which partially divide it along the
whole of its length into right and left halves, become obvious.
The antero-median fissure is much shorter than the postero-
median septum. It dips dorsally to a commissure of white
matter, anterior white commissure, which connects the two
halves of the medulla spinalis; and it contains a fold of pia
mater and branches of the anterior spinal vessels. The
postero-median sulcus is a shallow furrow which runs along

the posterior surface of the medulla spinalis in the median
plane, and the postero-median septum extends from the
bottom of the sulcus to a transverse grey commissure called
the posterior commissure.
The two halves of the medulla spinalis, thus marked off
from each other, are to all intents and purposes symmetrical,
and they are joined by a more or less broad band or com-
missure which intervenes between the anterior fissure and the
posterior septum.
An inspection of the surface of each lateral half of the
medulla spinalis brings into view a groove or furrow at some
little distance from the postero-median sulcus; it is called
the postero-lateral sulcus. Along the bottom of this groove
11—13 a

the fila of the posterior nerve-roots enter the medulla spinalis
(O.T. spinal cord) in accurate linear order. There is no
corresponding furrow on the anterior part of each lateral half
of the medulla spinalis in connection with the emergence of
the fila of the anterior nerve-roots; and it should be noted
that these fila emerge over a broad area, which corresponds
in its width to the thickness of the subjacent anterior column
of grey matter.
The medulla spinalis is composed of an inside core of grey
matter which is surrounded on all sides by an external coating
of white matter.
Gray Matter of the Medulla Spinalis.—The grey matter in
the interior of the medulla spinalis has the form of a fluted
column. When seen in transverse section, it presents the
shape of the letter H. In each lateral half of the medulla
spinalis there is a comma-shaped mass of grey matter, the
concavity of which is directed laterally. The crescents of
opposite sides are connected across the median plane by a
transverse band, which is called the grey commissure. The
postero-median septum passes from the surface of the medulla
spinalis to the grey commissure. The bottom of the antero-
median fissure is separated from it by an intervening strip
of white matter which is termed the anterior white commissure.
In the grey commissure may be seen the central canal of
the spinal medulla. It is just visible to the naked eye as a
minute speck. This canal tunnels the entire length of the
spinal medulla, and opens above (after having traversed the
lower half of the medulla oblongata) into the fourth ventricle
of the brain. The portion of the grey commissure which lies
posterior to the central canal is called the posterior commissure,
the portion anterior to it receives the name of anterior grey
commissure.
In each crescentic mass of grey matter certain well-defined
parts may be recognised. The projecting portions which
extend posterior and anterior to the connecting transverse grey
commissure are termed the posterior and the anterior grey
columns. They can be distinguished from each other at a
glance.
The anterior grey column is short, thick, and very blunt at its
extremity. Further, its extremity is separated from the surface
by a tolerably thick coating of white matter, through which
the fila of the anterior nerve-roots pass on their way to the
surface. The thickened end of the anterior column is termed
the caput columna anterioris, and the constricted part close to
the grey commissure is called the cervix columna anterioris.
The posterior grey column in most localities is elongated and
narrow. Further, it is drawn out to a fine point, which almost
reaches the bottom of the postero-lateral sulcus. This
pointed extremity receives the name of the apex columna
posterioris; the slightly swollen part which succeeds it is
the caput columnae posterioris; whilst the slightly constricted
part adjoining the grey commissure goes under the name of
the cervix columna posterioris.
Covering the tip of the posterior column there is a substance
which differs in its composition from the general mass of grey
matter, and presents a translucent appearance. It is termed
the substantia gelatinosa (Rolandt).
The grey matter is not present in equal quantity through-
out the entire length of the medulla spinalis. Therefore it is
necessary that it should be considered in different regions, and
it must be understood, when the terms cervical, lumbar, sacral,
etc., are applied to different portions of the spinal medulla,
that these terms apply to the regions to which the nerves of
the same name are attached.
Wherever there is an increase in the size of the nerves
attached to a particular part of the medulla spinalis, there a
corresponding increase of the grey matter may be noticed. It
follows from this that the districts in which the grey matter
bulks most largely are the lumbar and cervical swellings.
The great nerves which go to form the limb plexuses enter
and pass out from those portions of the medulla spinalis. In
the intermediate thoracic region there is a reduction in the
quantity of grey matter, in correspondence with the smaller
size of the thoracic nerves.
The shape of the crescentic masses of grey matter is not
the same in all regions. In the thoracic region both columns
are narrow, although the distinction between the anterior grey
column and the more attenuated posterior grey column is still
sufficiently manifest. In the cervical region the contrast
between the grey columns is most marked; the anterior grey
column is very thick in comparison with the posterior grey
column. In the lumbar region, on the other hand, the
difference in the thickness of the two grey columns is not
nearly so apparent, owing to a broadening out of the

in the sacral region, they are almost equal in depth and the
central canal occupies the centre of the medulla spinalis.
White Matter of the Medulla Spinalis.—The white matter
forms a thick coating on the outside of the fluted column of
grey matter. It is marked off into three funiculi. The
posterior funiculus is wedge-shaped in transverse section, and
lies between the postero-median septum and the posterior
grey column. The lateral funiculus occupies the concavity of
the grey crescent. Posteriorly it is bounded by the posterior
grey column and the postero-lateral sulcus, whilst anteriorly it
extends as far as the most lateral fila of the anterior nerve-
roots. The anterior funiculus includes the white matter

between the antero-median fissure and the anterior column
of grey matter, and also the white matter which separates
the thick extremity of the anterior grey column from the
surface of the spinal medulla and is traversed by the emerging
fila of the anterior nerve-roots.
In the cervical region a faint longitudinal groove runs
downwards on the surface of the posterior funiculus of the
medulla spinalis. This indicates the position of a septum
which passes into the funiculus from the deep surface of the
pia mater and divides it incompletely into two unequal strands.
The groove is termed the intermediate posterior sulcus. The
strand on its medial side is the fasciculus gracilis (Goll's),
whilst the lateral and larger strand receives the name of the
fasciculus cuneatus (Burdach's).
11—13 c
HEAD AND NECK
The white matter of the medulla spinalis increases steadily
in quantity from below upwards.
The fasciculi gracilis and cuneatus, which form the posterior funiculus
of the medulla spinalis, are composed of fibres which enter the spinal medulla
as the fila of the posterior nerve-roots. In the lower portion of the medulla
spinalis the two fasciculi are not marked off from each other.
In the lateral and anterior funiculi of the adult spinal medulla it is not
possible with the naked eye to distinguish the different strands of fibres of
which they consist, but the student should remember that such strands or
tracts are present. The three best-defined tracts in the antero-lateral part
of the spinal medulla are, (1)the fasciculus cerebello-spinalis (O.T. direct
cerebellar tract); (2) the fasciculus cerebro-spinalis lateralis (O.T. crossed
pyramidal tract); (3) the fasciculus cerebro-spinalis anterior (O.T. direct
pyramidal tract).
The fasciculus cerebello-spinalis ascends to the cerebellum, but, traced
in the opposite direction, it is found to disappear in the lower thoracic region
of the medulla spinalis. The fasciculus cerebro-spinalis lateralis occupies
a larger district of the medulla spinalis. It is placed in the lateral funiculus
anterior to the posterior column of grey matter and immediately medial to the
fasciculus cerebello-spinalis. -As the fasciculus cerebello-spinalis disappears in
the lower part of the medulla spinalis the fasciculus cerebro-spinalis lateralis
comes to the surface, and it can be traced as low as the fourth sacral nerve.
The fasciculus cerebro-spinalis anterior forms the narrow strip of the anterior
funiculus, which lies immediately adjacent to the antero-median fissure. It
reaches down to about the middle of the thoracic region of the medulla
spinalis and then disappears.
After the body has been five days on its face it will be
replaced upon its back with the thorax and pelvis supported
by blocks, and the dissectors of the head and neck should at
once proceed to clean the temporal fascia, and afterwards to
remove the brain and study the interior of the cranium.
Dissection.—Take away the anterior and superior auricular muscles and
remove the thin layer of fascia subjacent to them which descends from
the lower border of the galea aponeurotica to the zygomatic arch. When
this has been done the strong temporal fascia will be exposed. Note that
it is attached above to the temporal ridge and below to the upper border
of the zygomatic arch. The details of its connections will be studied at
a later period.
REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN.
After the superficial attachments of the temporal fascia
have been noted the dissectors of the head and neck should
proceed to remove the brain.
Dissection.—The head being supported upon a block, extend the median
incision, already made in the galea aponeurotica, to the nasion anteriorly and
REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN
to the external occipital protuberance posteriorly, and cut through the loose
areolar tissue and the pericranium in the same line down to the bone.
With the handle of the scalpel, or with a chisel, detach the pericranium from
the bone on each side and turn it posteriorly and downwards to the temporal
ridges, leaving the bone perfectly bare. Note that although the pericranium
is loosely attached over the surface of the various bones of the vault, it
is firmly attached along the lines of the cranial sutures by processes that
dip in between the bones and separate their edges. Detach the galea
aponeurotica and the temporal fascia from the temporal ridge on each side
with the edge of the knife ; then carrying the edge of the knife anteriorly and
posteriorly between the temporal muscle and the bone detach the upper
part of the muscle from the skull. When this has been done, each half of the
scalp can be turned down over the ear.
The dissectors should next obtain a saw, a chisel, and a mallet, and

proceed to remove the calvaria. The line along which the saw is to be
used may be marked out on the skull by encircling it with a piece of string,
and then marking the cranium with a pencil along the line of the string.
Anteriorly, the cut should be made fully three-quarters of an inch above the
margins of the orbits ; posteriorly, it should be carried round at the level of a
point midway between the lambda1 and the external occipital protuberance.
The saw should be used to divide the outer table of the skull only. When
the diploe is reached, the sawdust will become red and moist, and the saw
should then be abandoned. The hammer and chisel are now brought into
requisition, and by short sharp strokes with these the inner table can
readily be split along the line in which the outer table of the cranium is
divided. When this has been done, insinuate the hook at the end of the
cross-bar of the chisel into the fissure in front, and wrench off the skull-cap.
Dura Mater Encephali.—The brain is clothed by three
distinct membranes, which are termed the meninges. These

at which the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures meet.
HEAD AND NECK
are from without inwards—(1) the dura mater; (2) the
arachnoid; and (3) the pia mater.
When the skull-cap is detached, the outer surface of the
dura mater, as it covers the upper surface of the cerebral
hemispheres, is exposed. It is rough, and dotted over with
bleeding points. If a portion is placed in water, its roughness
becomes still more manifest, and is seen to be due to a multi-
tude of fine fibrous and vascular processes by which it is
connected with the deep surface of the bones. These have
necessarily been torn asunder in the removal of the skull-
cap. The bleeding points are most numerous along the
median line, or, in other words, along the line of the superior
sagittal sinus (O.T. longitudinal); and if the handle of the
knife is run from before backwards, so as to make pressure
along this line, a considerable quantity of blood will ooze out.
This shows that a number of small veins from the cranial
bones have been ruptured. The degree of adhesion between
the dura mater and the inner surface of the cranial bones
varies in different subjects and in different localities. In all
cases it is strongly adherent along the lines of the sutures, like
the pericranium externally; and, further, it is much more firmly
attached to the base than to the vault of the cranium. In the
child—indeed, as long as the bones of the cranium are grow-
ing—it is more adherent than in the adult; and it is more
firmly bound to the bone again in old age.
The dissectors should now clean the outer surface of the
dura mater with a sponge. They will then recognise the middle
meningeal artery upon each side, ascending in the substance
of the membrane, and sending off its branches in a widely
arborescent manner. It stands out in bold relief from the
membrane. If the skull-cap is examined, its inner surface
will be observed to be deeply grooved by the branches
of the artery and the veins which accompany and lie external
to them (Wood Jones). The meningeal arteries are not
intended for the supply of the membrane alone, as the name
might lead one to imagine. They are also the nutrient
vessels of the inner table and diploe of the cranial bones.
Granulationes Arachnoideales (O.T. Pacchionian Bodies).
—These granulations are almost invariably present, and, as a
rule, are best marked in old subjects. They are small granula1
bodies, ranged in clusters on either side of the superior
sagittal (O.T. longitudinal) sinus, into which many of them
protrude (Fig. 83). As a general rule, they are most evident
towards the posterior part of the parietal region. At first sight
they appear to be protrusions from the dura mater, but this
is not the case. They spring from the arachnoid and the sub-
arachnoid tissue, and are enlargements of the normal villi of
the membrane (Fig. 84).
Two Layers of the Dura Mater.—Having noted these
preliminary details from an examination of the outer surface
of the dura mater, the student is in a position to understand
that this membrane does not belong entirely to the brain.
It performs a double function: (1) it acts as an internal
periosteum to the bones forming the cranial cavity; and (2)

it gives support to the different parts of the brain. Conse-
quently, it consists of two strata, which, in most localities, are
firmly adherent, but they can usually be easily demonstrated
in the dissecting-room. These strata may very appropriately
be termed the endocranial and the supporting layers. Along
certain lines these two layers separate from each other. In
some cases they separate so as to form blood channels, termed
sinus dura mairis, for the conveyance of venous blood; in
other cases they separate in order that the inner supporting
layer may form strong folds or partitions, which pass in
between certain parts of the brain: and by these partitions the
cranial cavity is divided into compartments communicating
freely with one another, and each holding a definite sub-
division of the brain (Fig. 87).
Dissection.—These points must now be verified. Begin by tilting the
HEAD AND NECK
head forwards. Support it in this position, and make two incisions through
the dura mater in an antero-posterior direction—one on each side of the
superior sagittal sinus, and along its whole length. From the mid-
point of each of these incisions another cut must be made through each
lateral portion of the dura mater downwards to the cut margin of the skull
immediately above the ear (Fig. 85). The dura mater covering the upper
aspect of the brain is thus divided into a central strip containing the
superior sagittal sinus, and four triangular flaps. The flaps should
now be turned downwards over the cut margin of the skull, and in this
position they preserve the brain, during its removal, from laceration by the
sharp bony edge.
Lateral lacuna Arachnoideal granulation

F1g. 84.—Diagram of a frontal section through the middle portion of the
cranial vault and subjacent brain to show the membranes of the brain
and the arachnoideal granulations.
Cavum Subdurale.—The subdural space is the term applied
to the interval between the dura mater and the arachnoid—
Figs. 83 and 84. It contains a very small quantity of serous
fluid, which moistens the opposed surfaces of the membranes.
A striking contrast between the two surfaces of the dura
mater will be noted. The external surface is rough and
flocculent; the internal surface is smooth and glistening.
Venae Cerebri.—The cerebral veins which return the blood
from the surface of the cerebral hemispheres will be seen
shining through the arachnoid. They are lodged for the
most part in the sulci between the gyri, and run upwards
to the median plane. When they reach the superior sagittal
sinus they turn anteriorly, and lie against the wall of the sinus,
for some distance, before they open into it.
Sinus Sagittalis Superior (O.T. Superior Longitudinal).—
Open into this venous channel by running the knife through
its upper wall from behind forwards (Figs. 85 and 86). It
begins anteriorly at the crista galli of the ethmoid bone,
where it not infrequently communicates with the veins in
the nasal cavity through the foramen caecum. It extends

posteriorly, grooving the cranial vault in the median plane, to
the internal occipital protuberance, on the right aspect of
which it becomes continuous with the right transverse sinus
(O.T. lateral). Its lumen, which is triangular in cross-section,
is very small anteriorly, but expands greatly posteriorly. On
either side of the sinus, and opening into it, are a number of
clefts between the two layers of the dura mater; these are

crossed by a number of minute bands, named chorda Willisii;

lateral lacunae, pouring their blood into the sinus in a direc-
tion contrary to that in which the blood flows within the

anteriorly, whilst the blood in the sinus flows posteriorly.
The Relation of the Arachnoideal Granulations to the Superior
Sagittal Sinus and the Lateral Lacunae.—When the granulations push
themselves into the sinus or the lateral lacunae they push before them a
thin continuous covering of the floor of the space, and when they project
still further and encroach upon the bones of the skull they are covered also
by a thin expansion of the roof of the space.
Falx Cerebri (Figs. 86, 87).—This is a sickle-shaped redupli-
cation of the inner layer of the dura mater, which descends
in the median plane, between the two cerebral hemispheres.
In order to expose it, the cerebral veins must be divided as
they open into the superior sagittal sinus, and the hemisphere
gently pulled laterally. Anteriorly, the falx cerebri is narrow,
and attached to the crista galli of the ethmoid bone. It
increases in breadth as it passes backwards, and posteriorly
it is attached in the median plane to the upper surface of
the tentorium cerebelli. The anterior part of the falx is
frequently cribriform, and is sometimes perforated by apertures
to such an extent that it almost resembles lace-work. Along
Superior sagittal sinus

each border its two layers separate to enclose a blood-sinus.
Along its upper convex margin runs the superior sagittal
sinus; along its concave free border courses the much smaller
inferior sagittal sinus; whilst along its attachment to the
tentorium is enclosed the straight sinus. Its inferior concave
margin overhangs the corpus callosum, with which, however,
it is not in contact, except to a very slight extent, posteriorly.
Removal of the Brain.—The dissectors should now proceed to remove
the brain. Having divided the attachment of the falx cerebri to the
crista galli, pull it posteriorly. Next, removing the block upon which
the head rests, and supporting the occiput and posterior lobes of the brain
with the left hand, let the head drop well downwards. In all probability,
the frontal lobes will fall away by their own weight from the anterior fossa
HEAD AND NECK
of the base of the cranium, and perhaps carry with them the olfactory
bulbs. Should they remain in position, however, gently raise them with
the fingers, and at the same time separate the olfactory bulbs from the
cribriform plate of the ethmoid with the handle of the knife. As the
olfactory bulbs are raised the minute olfactory nerves which spring from
them and perforate the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone are torn across.
The large round and white optic nerves (second pair of cerebral nerves) now
come into view, as they leave the cranial cavity through the optic foramina.
When these are divided, the internal carotid arteries will be exposed, and
more posteriorly, in the median plane, the infundibulum will be seen; it
is a hollow conical process which extends from the tuber cinereum at the
base of the brain to the hypophysis (O.T. pituitary body), which lies in
the fossa hypophyseos (O.T. pituitary fossa). Divide the carotid arteries
and the infundibulum. Posterior to the infundibulum is the upper
border of the dorsum sellae, terminating on each side in the rounded posterior
clinoid process. Passing anteriorly on each side of the dorsum sellae is the
corresponding third cerebral nerve, which must not be touched at present.
A little more laterally, and on a slightly lower plane, is the medial or free
border of the tentorium cerebelli, a fold of the inner layer of the dura mater
which lies above the cerebellum and forms the roof of the posterior fossa
of the cranium.
Carefully displace the temporal pole of the brain from under cover of the
posterior border of the small wing of the sphenoid, which lies to the lateral
side of the optic nerve and the cut end of the internal carotid artery; then
raise the temporal lobe from the floor of the middle fossa, and from the
upper surface of the tentorium cerebelli. Pass the knife posterior to the
dorsum sellae, immediately above the level of the third cerebral nerve, and
cut through the midbrain, as it ascends from the posterior fossa, from its
lateral surface inwards to the median plane. Repeat the operation in the
same way on the opposite side, and remove the cerebrum and upper part of
the midbrain from the cranium.1
Place the removed cerebrum in the vault of the cranium and lay it aside.
Then note the relative positions of the parts exposed. Anteriorly lies the
floor of the anterior fossa of the cranium ; behind it, on a more depressed
plane, the middle fossa, and still more posteriorly the sloping tentorium
cerebelli.
In the median plane anteriorly is the projecting crista galli, partially
dividing the anterior fossa into lateral halves. On either side of the crista
galli is the depression from which the olfactory bulb was dislodged, and still
more laterally are the portions of the floor of the anterior fossa which form
the roofs of the orbits; they bulge upwards as well-marked convexities.
Each lateral part of the floor of the anterior fossa terminates posteriorly in
a sharp margin, formed by the posterior border of the small wing of the
sphenoid. This margin overhangs the anterior part of the middle fossa.
It is covered with a thickening of dura mater in which runs the spheno-
parietal blood sinus, and it terminates medially in a projecting process,
the anterior clinoid process. On the medial side of each anterior clinoid
process lie the corresponding optic nerve and internal carotid artery, and
springing from the upper surface of the artery is its ophthalmic branch,
which runs anteriorly under cover of the optic nerve. Posterior to the
divided ends of the internal carotid arteries, and in the median plane, is the
infundibulum descending into the hypophyseal fossa, and more posteriorly,
on either side, are the projecting posterior clinoid processes. The area
between the four clinoid processes is covered by a fold of the inner layer
For alternative method see p. 217.
of the dura mater, termed the diaphragma sella. In its centre is an
aperture through which the infundibulum passes to join the hypophysis
(O.T. pituitary body); and it binds down the hypophysis in the fossa. In its
anterior and posterior margins, respectively, are lodged the sinus inter-
cavernosus anterior and the sinus intercavernosus posterior (O.T. circular
sinus).

F1g. 88.—Interior of the Cranium after the removal of the cerebrum. The
transverse, straight, and superior petrosal sinuses have been opened, and
the dura mater has been removed from the floor of the middle fossa.
In the dura mater, on each side of the hypophyseal
(pituitary) fossa, lies the corresponding cavernous sinus, which
will be dissected later, and still more laterally are the de-
pressed lateral portions of the middle cranial fossa, lined with
dura mater, in which the trunk and some of the branches of
vol. n—14
HEAD AND NECK
the middle meningeal artery are visible. Posterior to the
middle fossaliesthe tentorium cerebelli covering the cerebellum.
The peripheral margin of the tentorium is attached, on each
side, to the posterior clinoid process, the upper margin of the
petrous part of the temporal bone, the posterior inferior angle
of the parietal bone, and to the transverse ridge on the inner
surface of the occipital bone. The central or free margin
crosses the attached margin behind the posterior clinoid
process on each side, and is attached anteriorly to the apex
of the anterior clinoid process. It bounds an oval opening,
the door of the tent, through which pass the midbrain sur-
rounded by the arachnoid and the pia mater, and the posterior
cerebral arteries. Piercing the midbrain nearer its posterior
than its anterior border is the aquseductus cerebri (O.T.
aqueduct of Sylvius). Posterior to the aqueduct is the lamina
quadrigemina of the midbrain and anterior to it the pedun-
culi (O.T. crura) cerebri. Each peduncle consists of an
anterior part, the basis pedunculi (O.T. crusta), and a posterior
part, the tegmentum, the two being separated by a lamina of
dark coloured tissue, the substantia nigra. The bases pedun-
culi are entirely free from each other, but the tegmental
portions are united together anterior to the aqueduct.
Running anteriorly and laterally from the medial side of
each peduncle to the angle between the anterior ends of the free
and the attached borders of the tentorium, is the third cerebral
nerve. Close to the midbrain the nerve passes between the
posterior cerebral artery above and the superior cerebellar
artery below; and between the free and attached borders
of the tentorium it pierces the dura mater, in the middle
fossa, and enters the wall of the cavernous sinus. Between
the posterior ends of the third nerves lies the upper end of
the basilar artery, dividing into the two posterior cerebral
branches; and the dissectors should note that the arteries
lie in an enlargement of the subarachnoid space which is
known as the cisterna interpeduncularis. In the median plane
posterior to the midbrain is the divided vena cerebri magna
(O.T. great vein of Galen). It passes posteriorly and upwards,
and pierces the apex of the tentorium to enter the straight
sinus, which lies in the angle of union between the falx
cerebri and the tentorium cerebelli.
Curving posteriorly around the midbrain and ending
posteriorly in the great cerebral vein on each side is the vena
basalis, and immediately above it, running anteriorly, is the
slender fourth cerebral nerve. If the free border of the
tentorium is turned laterally, at the point where it is crossing
the attached border, the fourth nerve will be seen perforating
the inner layer of the dura mater to enter the wall of the
cavernous sinus.
When the dissectors have verif1ed the facts noted above,
they should examine the lower free border of the falx cerebri,
in which they will find the small inferior sagittal sinus, which
terminates posteriorly, at the apex of the tentorium, in the
straight sinus. The straight sinus must now be opened by
carrying the knife posteriorly through the falx cerebri along
its line of union with the tentorium. Then the falx cerebri
must be cut away from the occipital bone, and as this is done
the posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus will be opened
up. After the falx has been removed the right and left
transverse and the right and left superior petrosal sinuses must
be opened by incisions carried along the attached border of
the tentorium (Fig. 88). The dissectors will probably find
that the superior sagittal sinus turns to the right and becomes
continuous with the right transverse sinus, whilst the posterior
end of the straight sinus turns to the left and joins the left
transverse sinus. In a certain number of cases this arrange-
ment is reversed, and not uncommonly, as in the specimen
shown in Fig. 88, there is a communication between the
right and left transverse sinuses across the front of the internal
occipital protuberance. Occasionally the superior sagittal,
the two transverse sinuses, the straight sinus, and the occi-
pital sinus unite anterior to the internal occipital protuber-
ance in a common dilatation, the confluens sinuum (O.T.
torcular Herophili). The transverse sinus, on each side, runs
from the internal occipital protuberance to the lateral end of
the superior border of the petrous part of the temporal bone,
where it dips downwards into the posterior fossa, and at the
same point it is joined by the superior petrosal sinus, which
runs postero-laterally along the superior border of the petrous
part of the temporal bone from the cavernous sinus to the
transverse sinus, connecting the two together.
Dissection.—With the point of the scalpel open the spheno-parietal
sinus, which runs along the posterior border of the small wing of the
sphenoid, and trace it medially to the cavernous sinus, but do not open the
latter. Then remove the dura mater from the lateral part of the middle
fossa on one side to expose the semilunar (O.T. Gasserian) ganglion of the
II—14 a
HEAD AND NECK
fifth nerve, the middle meningeal artery and its two terminal branches, the
accessory meningeal artery, if it is present, and the great superficial petrosal
nerve. Commence immediately to the lateral side of the anterior part of
the free border of the tentorium, where a cut through the inner layer of the
dura will open into a space (O.T. Meckel's cave) between the two layers of
.the dura, in which lies the semilunar ganglion. From the postero-medial
border of the ganglion the posterior branch or sensory root passes backwards
into the posterior fossa to enter the pons ; and from its anterior-lateral border
the ophthalmic branch passes upwards and anteriorly in the lateral wall of
the cavernous sinus, the maxillary branch runs anteriorly to the foramen
rotundum, and the mandibular branch passes downwards into the foramen
ovale. By theside of the mandibular nerve the accessory meningeal artery may
befound entering the cranium; and a little further posteriorly the middle men-
ingeal artery will be seen passing into the middle fossa through the foramen
spinosum. After entering the cranium the middle meningeal artery runs
anteriorly and laterally, across the floor of the middle fossa, towards the
lateral wall and divides into an anterior and a posterior branch; the former
ascends on the anterior part of the lateral wall to the anterior inferior angle
of the parietal bone, and the latter runs posteriorly and laterally, and then
ascends on the inner surface of the squamous part of the temporal bone.
The great superficial petrosal nerve appears on the anterior surface of the
petrous part of the temporal bone through the hiatus nervi facialis, which
lies to the medial side of the eminentia arcuata. It runs anteriorly and
medially and disappears beneath the semilunar ganglion.
After the structures mentioned above have been found
and cleaned, the dissectors must remove the tentorium cere-
belli. Cut through the free border immediately posterior to
the point where it crosses the attached border; the fourth nerve
also will be divided by this incision. Repeat the incision on
the opposite side, and then cut through the membrane close
to its attached border, but to the medial sides of the superior
petrosal and transverse sinuses; next divide the venae basales
at their points of junction with the vena cerebri magna
(O.T. vein of Galen); then raise the anterior part of the
tentorium and, passing the knife beneath it, separate it from
the falx cerebelli, which is attached to its lower surface in the
median plane. The tentorium may now be lifted out and the
arachnoid covering the upper surface of the cerebellum will
be exposed.
After the upper surface of the cerebellum has been cleaned,
cut through the third cerebral nerves, and then press back-
wards the pedunculi cerebri and the pons (Varolii), which lies
immediately below them, to expose the fifth and the sixth
nerves. Cut the fifth nerves as they cross the upper borders
of the petrous parts of the temporal bones, and then divide
the small sixth nerves, which lie more medially and at a
slightly deeper level. Press the pons and cerebellum still
further back and divide the seventh and eighth nerves as
they enter the internal acustic meatus. Below the eighth
nerves He the ninth, tenth, and eleventh nerves. These also

removed, and then examine the cut ends of the cerebral nerves
and the blood sinuses which lie in the region of the posterior
fossa.
In the upper end of the vertebral canal lies the
upper extremity of the severed medulla spinalis, attached
on either side to the margin of the foramen magnum by
the uppermost dentation of the ligamentum denticulatum.
Anterior to the ligamentum denticulatum, on each side, is
the vertebral artery, and still more anteriorly, on a slightly
deeper plane, the fila of the anterior root of the first cervical
nerve may be distinguished. At a higher level on each side
the two rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve pierce the dura, as
they pass into the hypoglossal canal (O.T. anterior condyloid
foramen). The spinal root of the accessory nerve passes
through the foramen magnum into the cranium, posterior to
the ligamentum denticulatum, and, turning laterally over
the margin of the foramen magnum, it joins the cerebral
fibres of the accessory and the tenth nerve, with which it
passes through an aperture in the dura opposite the jugular
foramen. Immediately above the eleventh and tenth nerves
the smaller trunk of the ninth nerve pierces the dura. Above
the ninth nerve the eighth nerve and the motor and sensory
roots of the seventh nerve pass into the internal acustic
meatus, accompanied by the small auditory branch of the
basilar artery and the auditory vein. The two roots of the
seventh nerve lie in a groove on the upper and anterior
aspect of the eighth, the small sensory root (O.T. pars
intermedia) being situated between the motor root and the
eighth nerve. The small motor and the large sensory root
of the fifth nerve pass through an opening in the dura which
lies above and medial to the internal acustic meatus; and the
sixth nerve pierces the dura mater below and to the medial
side of the opening for the fifth nerve, opposite the side of
the base of the dorsum sellse. The small fourth nerve
pierces the under surface of the free border of the tentorium
at the point where it is crossing the attached border.
After the dissectors have familiarised themselves with the
positions of the cerebral nerves as they pierce the dura mater,
they should examine the falx cerebelli and complete the
display of the cranial blood sinuses.
The Falx Cerebelli is a small sagittal fold of the inner
layer of the dura mater which projects anteriorly, between the
lateral lobes of the cerebellum, from the internal occipital
crest (Figs. 87, 89).
Sinus Transversus (O.T. Lateral).—The horizontal part of
the transverse sinus has already been traced from the internal
occipital protuberance to the superior border of the petrous
part of the temporal bone, where it turns downwards to
the jugular foramen. At first the descending portion runs
downwards, on the inner surface of the mastoid part of the
temporal bone, and then anteriorly and again downwards
across the upper and anterior surfaces of the jugular process
II—14 c
HEAD AND NECK
of the occipital bone. On account of the sinuosity of its
course this part is called the sigmoid portion of the transverse
sinus. Open this part of the sinus and find the mouth of the
mastoid emissary vein in its posterior border about half-way
down.
The dissectors should now obtain the basal part of a
macerated skull and should note the relation of the transverse
sinus to the outer surface. They will find that the position
of the sinus can be indicated on the external surface, by a line
which commences at the external occipital protuberance, passes
forwards, with a slight upward convexity, along the superior
nuchal line to the upper part of the mastoid part of the
temporal bone and then descends to the level of the lower
margin of the external meatus.
Sinus Occipitalis.—The occipital sinus is not uncommonly
absent. When it is present it commences in the right or left
transverse sinus or the confluens sinuum, and descends for a
short distance in the posterior border of the falx cerebelli. It
terminates below in two lateral branches, which leave the falx
cerebelli and run along the borders of the foramen magnum
between the layers of the dura mater, to terminate anteriorly
in the lower ends of the transverse sinuses.
Sinus Petrosus Inferior.—The inferior petrosal sinus lies
along the posterior angle of the petrous part of the temporal
bone extending from a point lateral to the opening for the
sixth nerve to the medial side of the opening in the dura
for the ninth nerve of the same side. Lay the sinus open.
It opens anteriorly into the cavernous sinus, from which it
receives blood, and it passes posteriorly through the jugular
foramen to join the upper end of the internal jugular vein.
Plexus Basilaris.—The two inferior petrosal sinuses are
connected together across the upper surface of the basilar
part of the occipital bone by a plexus of small venous channels,
to which the term basilar plexus is applied. Unless these
channels happen to be distended with blood the dissectors will
probably be unable to display this plexus.
The dissectors should note that the dura mater is much
more firmly attached to the bones of the base than it was to
the bones of the vertex, a fact which should have attracted
their attention as they removed the membrane from the floor
of the middle fossa. They should note also that it gives
sheaths to the nerves which pierce it, and that at the margins
217
of the various foramina its outer layer becomes continuous
with the periosteum on the outer surface of the cranium,
whilst at the margin of the foramen magnum the inner layer
becomes continuous with the single layer of dura mater which
surrounds the medulla spinalis; and that at the same level the
arachnoid and pia mater of the brain become continuous with
the arachnoid and pia mater of the spinal medulla (O.T. spinal
cord). Before terminating the survey of the interior of the
cranium the dissectors should revise their knowledge of the
blood vessels, and their relations to the dura mater; and they
should remove the hypophysis (O.T. pituitary body) and in-
vestigate its naked-eye structure.
Sinus Durae Matris.—Four blood sinuses lie 1n the median
plane: (1) the superior sagittal sinus in the upper or attached
border of the falx cerebri; (2) the inferior sagittal sinus in the
free part of the lower border of the falx cerebri; (3) the
straight sinus along the line of attachment of the falx cerebri
with the tentorium cerebelli; (4) the occipital sinus in the
upper part of the attached border of the falx cerebelli.
Two sinuses lie in a higher horizontal plane: these are the
spheno-parietal sinuses, which run along the posterior borders
of the small wings of the sphenoid bone.
Six sinuses lie in a lower horizontal plane: (1) the two
cavernous sinuses at the sides of the body of the sphenoid;
(2) the two superior petrosal sinuses along the upper angles
of the petrous parts of the temporal bones, in the anterior
parts of the attached border of the tentorium cerebelli; (3)
the horizontal parts of the transverse sinuses in the posterior
parts of the attached border of the tentorium. The terminal
parts of the transverse sinuses descend along the anterior parts
of the lateral walls of the posterior fossa.
Two sinuses run obliquely downwards, posteriorly, and later-
ally: these are the two inferior petrosal sinuses.
Three sinuses run transversely connecting paired sinuses of
opposite sides: (1) the anterior intercavernous sinus in the
anterior border of the diaphragma sellae; (2) the posterior
intercavernous sinus in the posterior border of the diaphragma
sellse; and (3) the basilar plexus which connects together the
inferior petrosal sinuses across the upper surface of the basilar
part of the occipital bone.
Alternat1ve Method of Remov1ng the Bra1n.—If it is thought
desirable to remove the brain entire by the more rapid but less instructive
HEAD AND NECK
method usually adopted in the post-mortem room, then the following steps
should be taken after the falx cerebri has been detached from the crista
galli and the dura mater lining the vault of the cranium has been thrown
aside (see p. 204).
Remove the block upon which the head has been resting, and, support-
ing the occiput and the posterior part of the brain with the left hand, let
the head drop well downwards and in all probability the weight of the
frontal lobes will draw them away from the floor of the anterior fossa of
the skull, and possibly the olfactory lobes may be carried with them. If
the olfactory bulbs remain in position on the cribriform plates of the
ethmoid at the sides of the crista galli, gently raise them with the handle
of the scalpel and press them backwards on to the under surfaces of the
frontal lobes. As the olfactory bulbs are raised the olfactory nerve fila-
ments which pass from their lower surfaces through the cribriform plates
are torn. As the frontal lobes are pressed backwards the large round
and white optic nerves come into view as they are leaving the cranial cavity
through the optic foramina. When these are divided the internal carotid
arteries will be exposed, and more posteriorly in the median plane lies the
infundibulum, a hollow conical process which connects the hypophysis
cerebri (O.T. pituitary body) with the tuber cinereum at the base of the
brain, and more laterally are the oculo-motor nerves. Sever each of these
structures in turn. On the lateral side of each third nerve lies the medial
or free border of the tentorium cerebelli passing anteriorly to be attached to
the anterior clinoid process. Turn this margin aside with the point of the
knife, and the minute trochlear nerve (fourth cerebral nerve) will be brought
into view. It lies under shelter of the free border of the tentorium, and
should be divided at this stage. The head must in the next place be turned
forcibly round, so that the face is directed over the left shoulder. Raise
the posterior part of the right cerebral hemisphere with the fingers, and
note that it rests upon the tentorium cerebelli—a broad horizontal process
of dura mater which intervenes between it and the cerebellum. Divide
the tentorium along its attached border, and take care whilst doing this
not to injure the subjacent cerebellum. Now turn the head so as to bring
its left side uppermost, and treat the tentorium on that side in the same
manner. The two parts of the trigeminal nerve (fifth cerebral nerve) per-
forating the dura mater near the apex of the petrous portion of the temporal
bone; the abducent nerve (sixth cerebral nerve) piercing the dura mater
behind the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone; the facial nerve and the
acustic nerve disappearing into the internal acustie meatus; the glosso-
pharyngeal, the vagus, and the accessory nerves leaving the skull through
the jugular foramen; and the two slips of the hypoglossal nerve piercing the
dura mater over the hypoglossal canal (O.T. anterior condyloid foramen),
will each in turn come into view upon either side, and must be divided in
succession. In the case of the three nerves passing out of the cranium
through the jugular foramen, the dissector should endeavour to leave the
accessory of the right side intact within the cranium, by dividing its roots
of origin from the medulla oblongata, whilst on the other side he should
remove it with the brain. This nerve is readily recognised because it
ascends from the vertebral canal into the cranial cavity through the foramen
magnum. Now thrust the knife into the vertebral canal, and divide the
medulla spinalis and the vertebral arteries, as they turn anteriorly upon
the upper part of the medulla spinalis (O.T. spinal cord); then sever the
accessory nerve of the left side, and the roots of the first pair of spinal
nerves. When this has been done let the head fall well downwards, gently
dislodge the medulla oblongata and cerebellum, and the whole brain can
be removed. The vena cerebri magna (Galen), as it passes from the
interior of the brain to enter the straight sinus, is ruptured by this
proceeding.
Meningeal Veins.—In addition to the named blood sinuses, venous
channels accompany the meningeal arteries and more particularly the
trunks and branches of the middle meningeal artery. These vessels are
of wider calibre than the corresponding arteries, and lie external to them
in the grooves on the inner surfaces of the cranial bones. When the
arteries are distended they compress the middle parts of the veins and
drive the blood into their anterior and posterior margins. When this
occurs each artery appears to be accompanied by two veins, a circumstance
which is probably responsible for the statement that some of the meningeal
arteries have venae comites.
Emissaria.—Emissary veins are blood channels which
connect the sinuses of the dura mater with the veins which
lie outside the cranium. They are: (1) Emissary veins con-
nected with the superior sagittal sinus—(a) from the anterior
extremity of the sinuses an emissary vein passes through
the foramen caecum. This vein divides below and either
becomes continuous with the veins of the nasal fossae, or its
branches pass through foramina in the nasal bones and join
the angular veins; (b) two parietal emissary veins, which
pass through the parietal foramina and connect the superior
sagittal sinus with the occipital veins. (2) Emissary veins
connected with the transverse sinuses — (a) two mastoid
emissary veins, one on each side, pass through the mastoid
foramina and connect the sigmoid parts of the transverse
sinuses with the posterior auricular veins; (b) two post-
condyloid veins, one on each side, pass through the condyloid
canals and connect the lower ends of the transverse sinuses
with the plexuses of veins in the suboccipital triangles. (3)
Emissary veins connected with the cavernous sinuses—(a) a
vein which traverses the foramen ovale, or the foramen Vesalii,
and connects the cavernous sinus with the plexus of veins
around the external pterygoid muscle; (b) a plexus of veins
which passes through the temporal bone with the internal
carotid artery and connects the cavernous sinus with the
pharyngeal venous plexus; (c) in a sense the ophthalmic
vein may be considered an emissary vein, for although under
ordinary cfrcumstances it is a tributary of the sinus, blood can
flow through it in the opposite direction from the sinus into
the orbit, and then along the tributaries which connect the
ophthalmic vein with the angular vein, and along the channels
which connect the ophthalmic vein through the inferior
orbital fissure with the veins in the infratemporal region.
HEAD AND NECK
The Arteries of the Cranial Cavity.—(1) The vertebral
arteries; (2) the internal carotid arteries; (3) the meningeal
arteries.
Arteriae Vertebrales.—The vertebral arteries pierce the
spinal dura mater below the foramen magnum, through which
they enter the cranium. As each artery passes through the
foramen it lies anterior to the highest dentation of the liga-
mentum denticulatum, and it passes between the hypoglossal
and first cervical nerves. It was divided when the hind brain
was removed, and its cut extremity lies near its point of
entrance into the cranial cavity.
Arteriae Carotides Internee.—Each internal carotid artery
enters the cranium at the lacerate foramen between the apex
of the petrous part of the temporal bone and the body of the
sphenoid, where it pierces the outer layer of the dura mater.
Then it runs anteriorly in the cavernous sinus to the medial
side of the anterior clinoid process, where it turns upwards,
pierces the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid,
and gives off its ophthalmic branch, which runs anteriorly below
the optic nerve to the orbit. The artery was cut immediately
behind its ophthalmic branch during the early stages of the
removal of the brain.
Meningeal Arteries.—These are the nutrient arteries of
the dura mater, and of the inner table and diploe of the cranial
bones. They are derived from a great number of different
sources, but the only one of any size is the middle meningeal
branch of the internal maxillary artery. The others are
small twigs, and, except in a well - injected subject, will
not be easily made out. They are: (1) anterior meningeal
from the anterior ethmoidal artery; (2) the accessory meningeal
from the internal maxillary artery; (3) some small branches from
the ascending pharyngeal, occipital, and vertebral arteries.
Each middle meningeal artery is a branch of the corre-
sponding internal maxillary artery. It enters the cranium
through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid, and divides
upon the inner surface of the great wing of that bone into two
large terminal branches. Of these, the anterior branch ascends
upon the great wing of the sphenoid, and the anterior
inferior angle of the parietal bone, grooving both deeply,
whilst the posterior branch turns posteriorly upon the
squamous portion of the temporal bone. The branches
which proceed from these trunks spread out widely and,
22 1
with the accompanying venous channels, occupy the arbor-
escent grooves on the inner surface of the cranial vault.
The vein which accompanies the middle meningeal artery
passes through the foramen spinosum and ends in the plexus
around the external pterygoid muscle.
Each anterior meningeal artery proceeds from the anterior
ethmoidal artery as it accompanies the anterior ethmoidal
nerve across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone.
It supplies a limited area of dura mater and bone in the
anterior fossa of the cranium.
The accessory meningeal arteries (O.T. small meningeal) are
somewhat inconstant; they arise either directly from the

internal maxillary or from the middle meningeal. Each
enters the cranium through the corresponding foramen ovale,
but it should not be looked for at the present stage, as it
is best examined along with the semilunar (O.T. Gasserian)
ganglion and the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve.
The meningeal branches from the ascending pharyngeal arteries
are the terminal twigs of those vessels. They enter the
cranium through the lacerate and jugular foramina, and
through the hypoglossal canal (O.T. anterior condyloid
foramen). The branch which passes through the jugular
foramen is the largest.
The meningeal branches of the occipital and vertebral arteries
are small, and are distributed in the posterior cranial fossa.
The former enter through the jugular, mastoid, and parietal
foramina, the latter through the foramen magnum.
HEAD AND NECK
The meningeal veins may be regarded as being arranged in
two sets: one set consists of small channels which pour their
blood into the blood sinuses; the other set is composed of
veins which accompany the meningeal arteries and carry
their blood to venous trunks on the exterior of the cranium.
Hypophysis Cerebri (O.T. Pituitary Body) (Fig. 91).—
The over-hanging margin of the diaphragma sellae should be
cut away and the hypophysis carefully dislodged from the
fossa hypophyseos (O.T. pituitary fossa) of the sphenoid bone.
It is an oval structure, slightly flattened from above down-
wards, and with its long axis directed transversely. It consists
of a large anterior lobe, and a smaller posterior lobe. The
anterior lobe is hollowed out posteriorly so as to form a
concavity for the lodgment of the posterior lobe. If a sagittal
section is made through the body, the line of separation
between the two lobes is seen very distinctly. The infundi-
bulum, which connects the hypophysis with the tuber cinereum
of the brain, is attached to the posterior lobe only (Fig. 91, 1).
Thus, even in the adult, there is a clue to the different modes
of development of the two lobes. The posterior lobe is derived
from the brain, whilst the anterior lobe is an off-shoot from
the primitive buccal cavity.
When the inspection of the interior of the cranium is completed the
dissectors must fill the cranial cavity with tow steeped in preservative solu-
tion; replace the skull-cap in position and retain it by bringing the scalp flaps
over it, and stitching them accurately together. The brain must be put in
a jar in a 5 per cent solution of formalin and placed aside till the dissection
of the remaining parts of the head and neck is finished.
THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE NECK.
After the skull-cap has been replaced and the scalp has
been stitched over it let the head hang down over the end of
the table, pull the chin as far from the sternum as possible
and fix it in position with hooks. Then examine the region of
the front of the neck. It is a large triangular area, bounded
laterally by the anterior borders of the sterno-mastoid muscles,
above by the lower border of the mandible, and below by the
middle part of the upper border of the manubrium sterni; and
it is divided by the median plane into two smaller subsidiary
triangles, the anterior triangles of the neck, each of which is
bounded above by the mandible, posteriorly by the sterno-
THE ANTERIOR PART OF THE NECK 223
mastoid, and anteriorly by the median plane. Pass the index
finger from the chin to the sternum along the median line and
locate in sequence the body of the hyoid bone, the angular
anterior border of the thyreoid cartilage, the rounded arch of
the cricoid cartilage and the rings of the trachea. The latter
are partly masked by the isthmus of the thyreoid gland.
Place the thumb and the forefinger on the body of the hyoid
bone and carry them posteriorly, one on each side, along its
great cornua. Note that the posterior ends of the cornua lie
immediately in front of the anterior borders of the sterno-
mastoid muscles. Above the body of the hyoid bone lies the
submental triangle roofed in by the mylo-hyoid muscles, which
form the diaphragm of the mouth; and above each great cornu
is the corresponding submaxillary region. Between the body
of the hyoid bone and the upper margin of the thyreoid
cartilage is the thyreo-hyoid space, bounded posteriorly by the
middle part of the thyreo-hyoid membrane, which lies anterior
to the upper part of the pharynx and the middle of the
epiglottis (Fig. 159). Trace the upper border of the thyreoid
cartilage posteriorly and note that it terminates on each
side in a pointed projection, the superior cornu, which lies
immediately in front of the anterior border of the sterno-
mastoid. Between the lower margin of the thyreoid cartilage
and the upper border of the cricoid cartilage lies the crico-
thyreoid ligament, forming part of the anterior wall of the
lower portion of the larynx.
The dissectors should make themselves thoroughly familiar
with the landmarks mentioned above, both on their own necks
and on the necks of their friends, and they should note that
whilst in the dead subject there may be some difficulty in
palpating the isthmus of the thyreoid gland, as it crosses
anterior to the second, third, and fourth rings of the trachea,
they will have no difficulty in locating the small soft cushion-
like mass in the living subject.
Dissection.—The skin was cut along the lower border of the mandible
at the commencement of the dissection of the face; now, make a median
incision through it from the chin to the sternum and turn the triangular
flap, thus marked out, posteriorly and laterally, to a short distance beyond
the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid. When this is done the super-
ficial fascia covering the anterior triangle on each side will be exposed; it
is thickest and most laden with fat in the submental region. In the upper
part of it lie the fibres of the platysma, running upwards and anteriorly
towards the mandible. The anterior fibres of the muscle gain attachment
to the anterior part of the lower border of the mandible, and some decussate
HEAD AND NECK
with those of the opposite side beneath the chin. The posterior fibres ascend
into the face, where they have already been followed to their connection
with the risorius and the orbicularis oris (p. 126). Cut through the platysma
along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid and turn it upwards, dividing
the twigs of the cervical branch of the facial nerve which supply it. Secure the
two terminal branches of the nervus cutaneus colli (O.T. transverse cervical
nerve), crossing the middle of the sterno-mastoid, and the cervical branch
of the facial nerve below the angle of the mandible. Trace the nerves
anteriorly, and note the union between the upper branch of the nervus
cutaneus colli and the cervical branch of the facial. In the superficial
fascia of the submental region and the anterior part of the submaxillary
region secure the tributaries of the anterior jugular vein; trace them down-
wards to the trunk of the vein and follow the trunk to the point where it
pierces the deep fascia; then remove the superficial fascia and expose the
deep fascia of the anterior region. Note that the deep fascia extends in a
continuous layer from the mandible to the sternum and from the sterno-
mastoid of one side to that of the other side. Note, further, that it is
attached to the body and the great cornua of the hyoid bone. The latter
attachment separates the infra-hyoid muscles, which lie in the lower part of
the neck, from the supra-hyoid muscles, which are situated in the region of
the floor of the mouth.
The dissectors will remember that in the course of the dissection of the
posterior triangle they met with several layers of the deep fascia. A similar
division into layers exists in the anterior region, and the opportunity should
be taken, whilst the fascia is still uninjured, to demonstrate certain of the
layers and the presence of the spaces between them.
The Suprasternal Space. — Make a transverse incision
through the deep fascia, immediately above the sternum, and
two vertical incisions, one along the anterior border of each
sterno-mastoid muscle. Carry the latter incisions upwards
for about one and a half inches, and turn the flap of fascia
marked out upwards. The space opened into by the reflection
of the first layer of deep fascia of the lower part of the neck
is the suprasternal space (Burns). Remove the areolar tissue
which fills it, find the lower parts of the anterior jugular
veins and the transverse anastomosis between them, and
expose the second layer of deep fascia, which forms the
posterior boundary of the space and covers and binds together
the infra-hyoid muscles of opposite sides. Pass the handle of
the scalpel downwards along the posterior wall of the space,
and note that it terminates, a short distance below the
upper border of the sternum, where the second layer of fascia
is attached to the posterior surface of the manubrium,
immediately above the origins of the infra-hyoid muscles. If
the handle of the knife is passed laterally along the posterior
wall of the space, it will pass deep to the sterno-mastoid into
the posterior triangle (see p. 145), and if it is pushed upwards
it will be stopped by the union of the first and second layers
of the deep fascia about half-way between the sternum and
the thyreoid cartilage. The attachments of the second layer
of deep fascia of the lower part of the neck may be summarised
as follows. It is attached below to the posterior surface of
the manubrium sterni and to the posterior border of the
clavicle, to which it binds the posterior belly of the omo-hyoid
(p. 145). Above, it fuses with the more superficial layer, along
an oblique line which ascends from the level of the coracoid
process to the level of the upper end of the trachea. Above
that level it forms, with the superficial layer, a common lamella,
which ascends on the infra-hyoid muscles to gain attachment
to the body and great cornu of the hyoid bone. The space
between the two layers contains, in the region of the anterior
triangle, the lower parts of the anterior jugular veins, the
anastomosis between them, and the areolar tissue in which
they are embedded. In the posterior triangle its contents are
the lower end of the external jugular vein, the terminations of
the transverse cervical and transverse scapular veins, the
transverse scapular artery, and areolar tissue. Note that the
anterior jugular vein on each side lies superficial to the deep
fascia in the upper part of the neck; then it pierces the first
layer of deep fascia and lies between the two layers, where it
anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side; finally it turns
laterally deep to the sterno-mastoid, and terminates in the
external jugular vein at the anterior boundary of the sub-
clavian part of the posterior triangle.
Dissection.—Make two incisions through the deep fascia of the upper
part of the anterior triangle, one along the lower border of the mandible
from the angle to half an inch from the chin, and a second at right angles
to the first, from its middle to the great cornu of the hyoid bone. Whilst
making the horizontal incision avoid injuring the external maxillary artery
(O.T. facial) and the anterior facial vein, which pierce the deep fascia at
the level of the anterior border of the masseter. Reflect the two triangular
flaps of fascia marked out by the incisions and expose the lower surface of
the submaxillary gland, the submaxillary lymph glands, the anterior and
posterior bellies of the digastric muscle, the lower part of the stylo hyoid
muscle, and a further part of the anterior facial vein.
The majority of the submaxillary lymph glands lie along
the lower border of the mandible on the superficial surface of
the submaxillary gland. The anterior facial vein crosses the
posterior part of the submaxillary gland superficially. The
external maxillary artery dips deeply between the lower border
of the mandible and the submaxillary gland. The posterior
vol. 11—15
HEAD AND NECK
and lower part of the submaxillary gland usually overlaps the
stylo-hyoid and the posterior belly of the digastric muscles,
and not infrequently it overlaps the great cornu of the hyoid
bone also. Its anterior border may overlap the anterior
belly of the digastric. Raise the lower border of the gland
and expose another layer of deep fascia covering the muscles
which lie deep to it. Place the handle of the knife on this
fascia and push it gently upwards. Note that it passes
upwards to the level of the mylo-hyoid line on the inner surface
of the mandible, to which the mylo-hyoid muscle is attached.
The fascial sheath in which the submaxillary gland is enclosed
consists, therefore, of a superficial layer of deep fascia which
extends from the great cornu of the hyoid bone to the lower
border of the mandible, and a deeper layer which passes from
the great cornu of the hyoid to the mylo-hyoid line of the
mandible. The two layers blend in front of the anterior
belly of the digastric, and posteriorly they unite, behind the
posterior belly of the digastric, with the connective tissue in
which the carotid vessels are embedded.
Dissection.—Remove the deep fascia in the region of the anterior
triangle and expose the divisions and the contents of the triangle.
The Divisions of the Anterior Triangle.—After the deep
fascia is removed, the dissector will recognise that each
anterior triangle may be divided into three subsidiary areas
which are called the digastric, the carotid, and the muscular
triangles, by means of the two bellies of the digastric muscle
and the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle.
The digastric triangle is bounded by the two bellies of the
digastric muscle and the lower border of the mandible.
The boundaries of the carotid triangle are, above and in
front, the posterior belly of the digastric; below and in front,
the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; and, behind, the anterior
border of the sterno-mastoid.
The muscular triangle is bounded, above and behind, by
the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid; below and behind,
by the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid; and in front,
by the middle line of the neck.
An additional triangle common to the two sides lies between the hyoid
bone below, the two anterior bellies of the digastrics laterally, and the
mandible above. This is called the submental triangle.
The Middle Line of the Neck.—Before commencing the
dissection of the contents of the subsidiary parts of the
anterior triangle the dissectors of both sides should, together,
study the structures which lie in the middle line of the neck
and immediately to either side of it; for this region is of the
highest importance to the surgeon. The area is divided by
the hyoid bone into supra-hyoid and infra-hyoid portions.
In the supra-hyoid part lie structures which are concerned
in the construction of the floor of the mouth. The dissector

F1g. 92.—Diagram to show the Boundaries of the Triangles of the Neck.
will have noticed already that the fatty superficial fascia is
more fully developed here than elsewhere in the neck, and
that the anterior margins of the two platysma muscles meet
and decussate in the median plane, for about half an inch
or so, below the chin. The anterior bellies of the two
digastric muscles are attached to the mandible, one on either
side of the symphysis. From this they descend towards the
hyoid bone, and diverge slightly from each other so as to
leave a narrow triangular space, the submental triangle, be-
tween them (Fig. 93). The floor of this space is formed by
the anterior portions of the two mylo-hyoid muscles, whilst
11—15 a
HEAD AND NECK
bisecting the floor of the triangle, in the median plane, is the
fibrous raphe into which these muscles are inserted. Not
infrequently the medial margins of the digastric muscles send
decussating fibres across the interval. Within the submental
triangle are the submental glands^ which receive lymph from

has been removed.
The Right Sterno-mastoid
the median part of the lower lip and chin and the anterior
part of the tongue.
In the median area of the infra-hyoid part there is a
narrow intermuscular interval, bounded on each side, above,
by the medial margins of the sterno-hyoid muscles, and to a
smaller extent, below, by the medial margins of the sterno-
thyreoid muscles (Fig. 93); more laterally lie the anterior bellies
of the omo-hyoid muscles. In this median intermuscular
interval the following structures will be found: (1) the median
part of the thyreo-hyoid membrane; (2) the anterior border
of the thyreoid cartilage with the projecting prominentia
laryngea (O.T. pomum adami) at its upper end; (3) the
arch of the cricoid cartilage; (4) the crico-thyreoid ligament
with the anastomosis between the crico-thyreoid arteries, and
the anterior ends of the crico-thyreoid muscles; (5) the first
ring of the trachea with the anastomosis between the medial
terminal branches of the superior thyreoid arteries; (6) the
isthmus of the thyreoid gland; (7) the inferior thyreoid veins,
and (8) the lower cervical rings of the trachea. Occasionally
the third or middle lobe of the thyreoid gland and the
levator glandulae thyreoidea,'or one or other of them, is found
extending upwards from the isthmus of the thyreoid gland.
When it is present the middle lobe either terminates above
in a pointed extremity or becomes continuous with a fibrous
cord, the remains of the thyreo-glossal duct, which disappears
posterior to the hyoid bone. The levator extends from the
isthmus or from the third lobe, and is attached above to the
lower border of the hyoid bone.
Dissection.—To display these structures fully the fascia which covers and
binds together the infrahyoid muscles of opposite sides must be removed.
When this has been done the anterior part of the thyreoid cartilage will be
exposed, and, above it, in the thyreo-hyoid interval, lies some loose areolar
tissue. If an incision, directed upwards and posteriorly, is made into this
tissue, behind the lower border of the hyoid bone, the infra-hyoid bursa
will be opened, and when this and the areolar tissue are removed, the
thyreo-hyoid membrane will be exposed. Note that the membrane extends
from the upper border of the thyreoid cartilage posterior to the body of the
hyoid bone to its upper border. When the areolar tissue in the lower part
of the intermuscular interval is removed the inferior thyreoid veins will be
displayed; they disappear, below, behind the sternum where they join the
innominate veins. Occasionally also a small unpaired artery, the thyreoidea
ima, will be found ascending, in the median plane, to the isthmus of the
thyreoid gland. Behind the inferior thyreoid veins lies another layer of
deep cervical fascia, the pretracheal layer. It covers the front of the
trachea, envelops the isthmus of the thyreoid gland, and is attached above
to the lower border of the thyreoid cartilage. The part which extends
from the isthmus of the thyreoid gland to the thyreoid cartilage acts as a
suspensory ligament of the isthmus. The dissectors will find that, so long
as the attachments of this part of the pretracheal fascia are not interfered
with, they cannot displace the isthmus of the thyreoid gland downwards.
On the other hand, if they cut through the attachment of the fascia to the
thyreoid cartilage, introduce the handle of the knife through the incision,
and press downwards, they will be able to displace the isthmus of the
thyreoid gland to a lower level and expose the upper rings of the trachea.
At the root of the neck the pretracheal fascia descends into the thorax,
11—15 4
HEAD AND NECK
along the anterior surface of the trachea, and it blends below with the
fibrous pericardium.
Remove the pretracheal fascia from the region of the intermuscular
interval, first above and then below the isthmus of the thyreoid gland. As
the fascia is dissected away the following structures will be displayed.
Immediately below the thyreoid cartilage is the crico-thyreoid ligament,
overlapped on each side by the anterior part of the crico-thyreoid muscle.
Crossing anterior to the ligament, transversely, is the anastomosis
between the crico-thyreoid branches of the superior thyreoid arteries.
It lies nearer the lower than the upper border of the ligament. Below
the crico-thyreoid ligament is the convex anterior part of the cricoid
cartilage; then follows the crico-tracheal ligament, uniting the cricoid
cartilage to the first ring of the trachea. The isthmus of the thyreoid
gland lies at a lower level opposite the second, third, and fourth rings of
the trachea. Along its upper border is the anastomosis between the
medial terminal branches of the superior thyreoid arteries, and below it
are the lower cervical tracheal rings.
The superficial layers of the deep fascia must now be removed from the
whole area of each anterior triangle, and for this purpose and for the
satisfactory dissection of the contents of the triangles, it is necessary that
the head be turned well over to the opposite side; therefore the dissectors
must arrange to work alternately.
Commence with the digastric triangle. Its boundaries are
the lower border of the mandible and the two bellies of the
digastric muscle.
Its contents are: (1) the lower part of the submaxillary
gland; (2) the submaxillary lymph glands; (3) part of the
external maxillary artery; (4) part of the anterior facial vein;
(5) the mylo-hyoid nerve; (6) the mylo-hyoid artery; (7) a
small part of the hypoglossal nerve; (8) a small part of the
lingual vein.
Dissection.—Remove the deep fascia which was previously turned aside
(p. 225) and clean the submaxillary lymph glands. Most of these glands
lie immediately below the mandible in the angle between it and the sub-
maxillary gland, but some may be found on the superficial surface of the
gland. Turn the gland upwards and fix it with hooks; then secure the
mylo-hyoid nerve and artery as they enter the posterior border of the
anterior belly of the digastric about the middle of its length. Define the
band of fascia which surrounds the intermediate tendon of the digastric and
binds it to the great cornu of the hyoid bone. Note that the tendon is em-
braced by the cleft lower end of the stylo-hyoid muscle. Clean the posterior
belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscle which descends along its
anterior border. Note that the posterior belly of the digastric and the
stylo-hyoid disappear, postero-superiorly, under cover of the angle of the
mandible. Clean the anterior belly of the digastric, and then examine
the floor or medial boundary of the triangle. Immediately behind the
anterior belly of the digastric it is formed by the posterior fibres of the
mylo-hyoid muscle; and more posteriorly and on a deeper plane it is
formed by the hyoglossus.
Clean the portion of the mylo-hyoid which is exposed and, at its
posterior border, immediately above the great cornu of the hyoid bone,
secure the hypoglossal nerve and the lingual vein, the vein lying below
the nerve. Displace the lingual vein and the hypoglossal nerve upwards;
cut through the fibres of the hyoglossus, immediately above and parallel
with the great cornu, and display the lingual artery, which in this position
lies immediately above the great cornu, parallel with the lingual vein but
separated from it by the hyoglossus muscle.
All the structures which have been mentioned above will be met with
in the dissection of other regions, when a full account of them will be given.
Turn next to the carotid triangle, so called because it
contains parts of the common, internal, and external carotid
arteries. It is bounded posteriorly by the anterior border of
the sterno-mastoid; above and anteriorly by the posterior
belly of the digastric; and below and anteriorly by the anterior
belly of the omo-hyoid.
Dissection.—Trace the anterior facial vein from the digastric triangle
across the superficial surface of the posterior belly of the digastric to its
posterior border, where it unites with the posterior facial vein, which is
descending from under cover of the lower end of the parotid gland. The
trunk formed by the union of the anterior and posterior facial veins is the
common facial vein. Trace the common facial vein downwards and
posteriorly to its union with the internal jugular vein, at or under cover
of the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid. Remove the deep fascia
and the areolar tissue, and the lymph glands which lie in the angle between
the posterior belly of the digastric and the anterior border of the sterno-
mastoid, below the lower end of the parotid gland; secure the lingual
vein, which passes backwards from the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid
bone to join the internal jugular vein; and the hypoglossal nerve as it
crosses anteriorly at a higher level, superficial to the internal and external
carotid arteries. As the nerve turns anteriorly across the large arteries it
is itself crossed, superficially, by the sterno-mastoid branch of the occipital
artery, and it gives off its descending branch. Trace the descending
branch downwards, in the fascia which lies superficial to the lower part
of the internal and the upper part of the common carotid arteries, to
the point where it disappears under cover of the anterior belly of the
omo-hyoid, avoiding injury to the lingual, common facial, and superior
thyreoid veins ;1 and secure the communicating branch, from the second
and third cervical nerves, which joins its posterior aspect. The latter
nerve may cross either superficial or deep to the internal jugular vein.
Return to the hypoglossal nerve at the point where it gives off its descending
branch, and trace it anteriorly to the upper aspect of the posterior end
of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, where it gives off the branch of
supply to the thyreo-hyoid muscle. Trace the branch into that muscle
below the level of the great cornu, then follow the trunk of the hypoglossal
anteriorly to the digastric triangle. Note that as it runs anteriorly it
passes deep to the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid
muscle, and superficial to the hyoglossus, which ascends to the tongue from
1 The lingual vein may join the common facial vein, in which case the
latter usually enters the internal jugular opposite the interval between the
hyoid bone and the thyreoid cartilage, as in the specimen depicted in Fig. 93.
The superior thyreoid vein joins the internal jugular or the common facial
vein opposite the thyreo-hyoid interval.

the upper border of the great cornu. Remove the fascial sheath from the
superficial surfaces of the lower parts of the internal and external carotid
arteries, and from the upper part of the common carotid artery. Note that
the latter divides into the two former at the level of the upper border
of the thyreoid cartilage, and that the external carotid is at first medial
and anterior to the internal carotid.
Five branches may spring from the external carotid in the carotid
triangle, three from its anterior surface: the superior thyreoid, the lingual
and the external maxillary; one from its medial surface, the ascending
pharyngeal; and one from its posterior surface, the occipital; but not un-
commonly the occipital and the external maxillary arise beyond the limits
of the carotid triangle under cover of the posterior belly of the digastric.
The superior thyreoid springs from the front of the lower part of the ex-
ternal carotid below the level of the great cornu of the hyoid and runs
downwards to the lower angle of the carotid triangle, where it disappears
under cover of the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid. The lingual arises
immediately above the level of the tip of the great cornu. It runs an-
teriorly above the level of the cornu, forming a loop, convex upwards,
which lies deep to the hypoglossal nerve; and it disappears under cover
of the posterior border of the hyoglossus muscle. The ascending pharyngeal
branch, which springs from the medial surface of the lower end of the ex-
ternal carotid, ascends on a deeper plane, between the external and in-
ternal carotids and the wall of the pharynx, and will be followed at a later
stage of the dissection. The external maxillary and the occipital arise
immediately below the posterior belly of the digastric and almost at
once disappear under cover of the muscle; not uncommonly they
arise under cover of its lower border. Before proceeding to clean the
branches of the external carotid secure the internal and external laryngeal
branches of the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve. The internal
branch will be found in the posterior part of the thyreo-hyoid interval below
the great cornu of the hyoid bone and behind the posterior border of the
thyreo-hyoid muscle, beneath which it disappears. It is accompanied by
the laryngeal branch of the superior thyreoid artery. The external branch
is more difficult to find; but, if the superior thyreoid artery and the upper
part of the common carotid are displaced posteriorly, the nerve will be
found, lying deep to them, in the fascia which covers the anterior part of the
inferior constrictor muscle. Remove the fascia from the surface of the in-
ternal jugular vein, which overlaps the posterior borders of the common
and internal carotid arteries. Dissect in the interval between the vein and
the arteries and secure the vagus nerve, which lies deeply. Remove the
remains of the fascia from the carotid arteries and the internal jugular vein,
but avoid injury to the hypoglossal nerve and its branches; and note the
presence of the upper deep cervical lymph glands which lie on the superficial
surfaces of the great arteries and the internal jugular vein. The glands are
sometimes very large, and the dissectors should remember that they receive
lymph from the face, the mouth and tongue, the posterior part of the nose
and the upper part of the pharynx. After the large vessels are cleaned,
remove the fascia from the branches of the external carotid artery and the
twigs they give off, so far as they lie in the region of the carotid triangle.
Commence with the superior thyreoid. Immediately after its origin it gives
off a small infra-hyoid branch, then a laryngeal branch which accompanies
the internal laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve; and, just
before it disappears under cover of the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, a
sterno-mastoid branch arises from its posterior border and runs downwards
and posteriorly, along the upper border of the omo-hyoid, across the super-
ficial aspect of the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein.
Next, clean the lingual artery and note its small supra-hyoid branch. The
external maxillary artery gives off no branches in the carotid triangle, but a
sterno-mastoid branch of the occipital artery will usually be found passing
downwards and posteriorly, superficial to the loop of the hypoglossal nerve.
Push the lower border of the parotid gland upwards, and immediately under
cover of it, at the level of the angle of the mandible, secure the accessory

and crosses superficial to the 1nternal jugular vein. It is sometimes accom-
panied by an additional branch to the sterno-mastoid from the occipital
artery.
The floor or medial boundary of the carotid triangle is
formed by the upper part of the thyreo-hyoid muscle, the
HEAD AND NECK
posterior part of the hyoglossus and the middle and inferior
constrictors of the pharynx. The two latter muscles cannot
be displayed at present, but the thyreo-hyoid is exposed below
the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and part of the hyoglossus
can be seen in the angle between the great cornu of the hyoid
and the lower part of the posterior belly of the digastric.
The Muscular Triangle.—When the deep fascia which
covers the muscular triangle is removed portions of the
three muscles are brought into view. Postero-superiorly is
the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid, more anteriorly and on
the same plane is the sterno-hyoid, and below and anterior to
the latter, but on a deeper plane, is a small part of the sterno-
thyreoid.
The muscles mentioned may be considered to form the
floor or medial boundary of the triangle, and if this view is
taken the structures they cover, which lie more deeply, are
under cover of the floor. These structures must now be
exposed.
Dissection.—Divide the anterior belly of the omo-hyoid along the
anterior border of the sterno-mastoid and turn it upwards to its insertion
into the hyoid bone. As this is done its twig of supply from the ansa hypo-
glossi will be cut. Divide the sterno-hyoid as low down as possible; turn
it upwards to its insertion into the body of the hyoid bone and note its nerve
of supply from the loop which is called the ansa hypoglossi, and is formed
by the union of the descending branch of the hypoglossal nerve and the
communicating branch from the cervical plexus. Secure the nerve to the
sterno-thyreoid from the ansa hypoglossi; then remove the fascia and expose
the lower part of the thyreo-hyoid muscle, the greater part of the sterno-
thyreoid and the anterior part of the thyreoid cartilage. Note that the
sterno-thyreoid is inserted into an oblique line on the outer surface of the
lamina of the thyreoid cartilage and that the thyreo-hyoid springs from the
same line and is inserted into the great cornu of the hyoid bone. The
crico-thyreoid branch of the superior thyreoid artery may be found passing
downwards and anteriorly along the upper end of the sterno-thyreoid
accompanied by the external laryngeal nerve ; or the nerve and the vessel
may lie deep to the upper end of the muscle.
Divide the sterno-thyreoid as low down as possible and turn it upwards
to its insertion; remove the fascia under cover of it and expose the lateral
lobe of the thyreoid gland, and below it a small part of the side of the
trachea. *
The dissector should note that whilst the sterno-mastoid remains undis-
turbed the posterior part of the lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland and its
lower extremity are not exposed, but if the sterno-mastoid is displaced
posteriorly the whole of the lateral surface of the lobe is brought into view.
The dissector should note also that until the sterno-mastoid is displaced
posteriorly only a small portion of the upper end of the common carotid and
the lower parts of the internal and external carotid arteries are visible;
indeed, the common carotid may be entirely concealed. Only a small part
of the anterior border of the internal jugular vein projects anterior to the
sterno-mastoid in the upper and posterior angle of the carotid triangle ; and
it also is not uncommonly hidden when the sterno-mastoid is well developed.
During life, however, when the muscle is soft and pliable the structures
concealed by it are readily exposed, for the muscle is easily displaced
posteriorly after the fascia has been divided along its anterior border. In
the dissecting-room it is not possible to obtain a proper view of the course
and relations of the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein, or
to appreciate the relations of the first part of the subclavian artery and the
relations of the scalenus anterior muscle, until the sterno-mastoid has
been reflected. Divide the external jugular vein immediately below the
point where it is joined by the posterior auricular tributary and turn it
downwards. Divide the great auricular nerve at the level of the angle of
the mandible and turn it posteriorly; and turn posteriorly the nervus
cutaneus colli, whose two terminal branches have been cut already. The
clavicular head of the sterno-mastoid was cut when the clavicle was
removed; now divide the sternal head, turn the muscle upwards towards its
insertion. As the muscle is turned upwards, sterno-mastoid branches of the
transverse scapular, superior thyreoid, and occipital arteries will be exposed;
and if they interfere with the reflection of the muscle they must be divided.
Slightly above the level of the sterno-mastoid branch of the occipital artery
the accessory nerve will be found passing through the deeper fibres of the
muscle, and care must be taken to avoid injury to it; but it may be dissected
out of the muscle and left in position on the lateral surface of the internal
jugular vein.
Deep Cervical Fascia.—When the sterno-mastoid has been
reflected a deep fascial plane of the neck is exposed in which
lie many lymph glands. Before carrying the dissection further
the dissector should reconsider the arrangement of the deep
cervical fascia. He has already seen that it forms a complete
sheath enclosing the muscles of the neck and the structures
which lie between and under cover of them. The general
arrangement of the fascia is studied best on transverse
sections of the neck made at the level of the isthmus of the
thyreoid gland and a short distance above the sternum. At
the former level it is possible to recognise (1) a superficial
layer; (2) a pretracheal layer; (3) a prevertebral layer; and (4)
a fascial sheath which encloses the common carotid arteries,
the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve, as they lie in
the angular interval between the sterno-mastoid laterally, the
thyreoid gland, the trachea, oesophagus medially, and the
prevertebral muscles posteriorly. The first or superficial layer,
as it is traced posteriorly, splits to enclose the sterno-mastoid
muscle. Beyond the sterno - mastoid it passes posteriorly
to the anterior border of the trapezius muscle, forming the
roof of the posterior triangle, then splits again to enclose the
trapezius, along the surfaces of which it is prolonged till it
blends with the supraspinous ligaments and the ligamentum

nuchse. The lamella which covers the deep surface of the
sterno-mastoid is blended with the lateral surface of the carotid
sheath. The pretracheal layer, which has been dissected
already in the median plane, ensheaths the thyreoid gland
and blends postero-laterally with the medial surface of the
carotid sheath. The prevertebral layer covers the anterior
surfaces of the prevertebral muscles and, passing laterally,
blends with the posterior aspect of the carotid sheath; then,

it passes posteriorly,

which form the floor of

and it becomes continu-

the deep muscles of the
posterior part of the neck.
Laterally and pos-
teriorly, the superficial
layer of the deep fascia
passes upwards over the
sterno-mastoid and the
trapezius to be attached
to the superior nuchal
lines and the mastoid
F'G- 9S-~fn^«a.0sfecdrn.CerViCal portions of the temporal
bones. In the anterior
cervical region it is attached to the body and the great cornua
of the hyoid bone, and then, as it is prolonged further upwards,
it splits anteriorly to enclose the submaxillary gland, and
posteriorly to enclose the parotid. It has been noted already
that the lamella which passes superficial to the submaxillary
gland is attached to the lower border of the mandible, and
that which passes deep to the gland is connected above to
the mylo hyoid line on the inner surface of the mandible. The
layer which passes superficial to the parotid gains attachment
to the zygoma and is prolonged forwards to blend with the
fascia covering the masseter. The lamella which passes deep
to the parotid covers its postero-medial and antero-medial
surfaces; the posterior part is attached above to the lower

border of the tympanic plate and the anterior part to the
posterior border of the petro-tympanic fissure (O.T. Glaserian).
It also gains an intermediate attachment to the styloid
process and to the posterior border of the angle of the
mandible. This particular portion is relatively thick; it lies
in relation with the lower part of the antero-medial surface of
the parotid and is known as the stylo-mandibular ligament.
When the superficial layer is traced downwards it is found
to split, between the cricoid cartilage and the sternum, into two
lamellae. The more superficial of the two lies superficial to
the sterno-mastoid and is at-
tached below to the upper
border of the sternum and the
upper border of the clavicle.
In the anterior region the
deeper lamella descends upon
the anterior surfaces of the
infra-hyoid muscles and is at-
tached below to the posterior
surface of the manubrium;
laterally it passes deep to the
sterno - mastoid and is fused
with the lateral border of the
carotid sheath. In the posterior
triangle the deeper lamella
ensheaths the posterior belly
of the omo-hyoid and binds it
down to the posterior border
of the clavicle. The space
between the two lamellae has
been called the supra-sternal
space. Its boundaries and contents have been fully described
already (p. 224).
* The upper attachment of the pretracheal layer is to the
cricoid cartilage and to the laminae of the thyreoid cartilage
below the insertion of the sterno-thyreoid muscle. At its
lower end it blends with the fibrous pericardium in the
middle mediastinum.
The prevertebral layer can be followed upwards to the
base of the skull, where it is attached, in the anterior cervical
region, to the posterior and medial margins of the jugular
foramen and to the basilar part of the occipital bone, anterior

to the insertions of the prevertebral muscles and posterior to
the superior constrictor of the pharynx. Below, it blends
with the fascia on the anterior aspect of the vertebral column
in the posterior mediastinal region.
The Carotid Sheath.—-The term carotid sheath is applied
to the fascia which surrounds and embeds the carotid arteries,
the internal jugular vein, and the vagus nerve. Part of it has
been removed already, and the dissector will have noted that
it is in no sense a membrane, but merely the fibro-areolar
tissue which fills the interval between the transverse processes
of the vertebrae posteriorly, the trachea, larynx, pharynx,
oesophagus, and the lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland medially,
and the sterno-mastoid laterally; that it is continuous with
the fascial planes in its immediate neighbourhood, and that

F1g. 97.—Diagram of the deep cervical fascia in a transverse
section of the lower part of the neck.
through it run the carotid arteries, the internal jugular vein,
and the vagus nerve, each in its own special compartment.
Dissection.—Remove the areolar tissue and the glands which He under
cover of the sterno-mastoid; stitch together the two parts of the divided
anterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle and fix the muscle to the common
carotid artery and the internal jugular vein with one or two stitches; then
proceed to display the structures which lie under cover of the sterno-mastoid.
A glance at the following list will convince the dissector that they are
extremely numerous.
Structures beneath the Sterno-Mastoid
Muscles.—The upper part of the splenius capitis; the
upper and posterior part of the posterior belly of the digastric;
the origins of the levator scapulae, the scalenus medius, the
longus capitis (O.T. rectus capitis anticus major), the rectus
capitis lateralis and the scalenus anterior; the intermediate
tendon of the omo-hyoid, and the lower and posterior part of
the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyreoid.
Arteries.—The upper part of the common carotid (the
lower part is still concealed by the lower parts of the omo-
hyoid and the lower parts of the sterno-hyoid and sterno-
thyreoid muscles); the transverse scapular and its sterno-
mastoid branch; the transverse cervical; the sterno-mastoid
branch of the superior thyreoid; the occipital and its sterno-
mastoid branches.
Veins.—The greater part of the internal jugular vein; a
part of the lower transverse portion of the anterior jugular
vein; and, occasionally, the lower end of the external jugular
vein when that vessel dips anteriorly to its termination.
Nerves.—The cervical plexus and its branches, including
the phrenic nerve; part of the accessory nerve.
If the lower parts of the divided sterno-hyoid and sterno-
thyreoid muscles are displaced downwards, the lower part of
the common carotid and the commencement of the first part of
the subclavian artery will be exposed. Crossing the front of
the latter are the lower portion of the cervical part of the vagus
and a strand of sympathetic fibres called the ansa subclavia;
on the left side, the subclavian artery and the ansa are con-
cealed by the commencement of the innominate vein. At
the same time the middle thyreoid vein will be exposed,
and the posterior border of the lateral lobe of the thyreoid
gland also.
Dissection.—Commence by cleaning the anterior branches of the cervical
nerves from the second to the eighth, as they emerge between the muscles
attached to the tubercles of the transverse processes of the cervical
vertebrae. The first nerve, which turns downwards anterior to the trans-
verse process of the atlas, will be exposed later. As the upper nerves are
cleaned the dissectors will find that the second is connected to the third,
and the third to the fourth, by looped strands, convex posteriorly, which
constitute the two lower loops of the cervical plexus. The second nerve is
connected with the first also by a loop, convex anteriorly, which passes
upwards anterior to the transverse process of the atlas and posterior to the
upper part of the internal jugular vein. It can be exposed if the vein is pulled
anteriorly; and the dissector must at the same time secure the twigs of
connection which pass from the medial side of the loop to the hypoglossal
nerve and to the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, which
lies behind the upper part of the internal carotid artery.
After he has defined the loops of the plexus he should trace the remains
of the small occipital, the great auricular, the transverse cutaneous nerve of
the neck and the supraclavicular branches, which he displayed in the
posterior triangle, to their origins from the roots of the plexus. The
communicating branches which pass anteriorly to the descendens hypoglossi
from the second, and sometimes also from the third cervical nerve, must be
HEAD AND NECK
followed; they may cross either superficial or deep to the internal jugular
vein. Then the phrenic nerve, which springs from the fourth cervical
nerve, and receives additional twigs from the third and fifth nerves, must
be followed downwards and anteriorly till it disappears under cover of the
lower part of the internal jugular vein. It lies upon the surface of the
scalenus anterior and passes deep to the omo-hyoid muscle and the trans-
verse cervical and transverse scapular arteries. Running parallel with,
and anterior to it, is the ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyreoid
artery.

This diagram shows that the descendens hypoglossi, the branch to the
thyreo-hyoid, and in all probability the branches to the genio-hyoid, are
composed of fibres given to the hypoglossal by the communicating twigs
it receives from the first cervical nerve.
Plexus Cervicalis.—This is a looped plexus formed by
the first four cervical nerves. It lies in the upper part of
the side of the neck under cover of the sterno-mastoid. The
upper loop of the plexus, which connects the first and second
nerves together, is directed forwards and lies between the
internal jugular vein anteriorly, and the transverse process of
the atlas posteriorly. The second and third loops, which
unite the second and third and the third and fourth nerves
are directed posteriorly; and they lie on the superficial surface
of the upper part of the scalenus medius muscle. The first
loop is connected with the upper ganglion of the sympathetic
trunk and with the hypoglossal nerve; and the roots of the
second, third and fourth nerves also are connected, by grey
rami, with the upper cervical sympathetic ganglion.
The branches of the plexus are divisible into two main
groups, the superficial and the deep. The deep branches are
separable into two groups: the anterior, which run forwards
and the posterior, which run backwards; and the superficial
branches are classified as ascending, transverse and descending.
The anterior group of deep branches includes: (1) the ramus
communicans cervicalis, and (2) the phrenic nerve.
The posterior group of deep branches is formed by: (1) The
communicating branches to the accessory nerve. (2) Branches
of supply to (a) the sterno-mastoid from the second nerve;
(b) the levator scapulae from the third and fourth; (c)
the trapezius from the third and fourth; (d) the scalenus
medius from the second, third, and fourth. (3) Less im-
portant muscular branches from the first loop to (a)
the rectus capitis lateralis; (b) the rectus capitis anterior
(O.T. rectus capitis anticus minor); (c) the longus capitis
(O.T. rectus capitis anticus major). (4) Muscular branches
from the third and fourth nerves to the longus colli.
The ascending group of superficial branches is formed by the
small occipital and great auricular nerves. The transverse
branch is the nervus cutaneus colli, and the descending
branches are the supraclavicular nerves. All the superficial
nerves have already been traced in the earlier stages of the
dissection (pp. 145, 146), but the phrenic nerve requires
careful consideration.
Nervus Phrenicus.—The importance of the phrenic nerve
depends upon the fact that it is the nerve of supply to the
chief muscle of respiration, the diaphragm. The majority of
its fibres spring from the fourth cervical nerve, but it receives
twigs from the third and, not uncommonly, from the fifth
nerve also. It descends from the neck through the superior
and posterior mediastinal regions of the thorax, and, after
piercing the diaphragm, it is distributed on its lower surface.
Only the cervical portion of the nerve belongs to the dis-
sector of the neck; the remainder is displayed by the dissector

of the thorax (p. 341). In the neck the nerve runs down-
wards and anteriorly, on the superficial surface of the scalenus
anterior, which forms its deep relation. In this part of its
course it is covered by skin, superficial fascia and platysma,
deep fascia and sterno-mastoid; and, deep to the sterno-mastoid,
it is overlapped by the internal jugular vein, and it is crossed
by the omo-hyoid, the anterior jugular vein, and the transverse
cervical and transverse scapular arteries on both sides; on the
left side by the thoracic duct, and on the right side by the
right lymph duct. At the root of the neck it passes from the
medial border of the anterior scalene to the anterior surface
of the first part of the subclavian artery; and it is covered
anteriorly by the clavicle on both sides, by the subclavian
vein on the right side, and by the commencement of the in-
nominate vein on the left side, and it crosses either anterior
or posterior to the internal mammary artery. It gives off no
branches in the neck, but it sometimes receives a communica-
tion from the nerve to the subclavius.
After the dissector has completed the examination of the formation, the
relations, and the branches of the cervical plexus, he should replace the
divided infra-hyoid muscles in position and study their attachments and
relations.
The Infra-hyoid Muscles are a series of fiat, band-like
muscles which lie upon the trachea, thyreoid gland, and
larynx. They are disposed in two strata—viz., the omo-hyoid
and the sterno-hyoid constituting a superficial layer; and
the sterno-thyreoid and thyreo-hyoid a deep layer.
Musculus Omohyoideus.—This is a two-bellied muscle. The
posterior belly springs from the upper border of the scapula
and the upper transverse scapular ligament. It crosses the
posterior triangle of the neck, dividing it into occipital
and subclavian portions, and terminates under cover of the
sterno-mastoid muscle in an intermediate tendon; and it is
superficial to the phrenic nerve and the scalenus anterior.
The tendon is held in position by a strong process of cervical
fascia which is firmly attached below to the sternum and the
first costal cartilage. The anterior belly emerges from under
cover of the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and takes
an almost vertical course through the anterior triangle. It is
inserted into the lower border of the body of the hyoid bone,
at the lateral side of the sterno-hyoid. In the anterior
triangle of the neck it forms the boundary between the
"'
carotid and the muscular subdivisions, and it lies superficial
to the internal jugular vein, the common carotid artery, the
descendens hypoglossi, the superior thyreoid artery, the ex-
ternal laryngeal nerve, the attachments of the sterno-thyreoid
and thyreo-hyoid muscles to the lamina of the thyreoid

cartilage; and immediately below its insertion it covers part
of the thyreo-hyoid membrane. Both bellies are supplied by
branches from the ansa hypoglossi. v
Musculus Sternohyoideus.—This arises from the posterior
aspect of the medial end of the clavicle, the posterior
sterno-clavicular ligament, and the posterior surface of the
manubrium. It is inserted into the lower border of the body
11—16 a
HEAD AND NECK
of the hyoid bone, between the median plane and the insertion
of the omo-hyoid. A short distance above the sternum an
oblique tendinous intersection frequently divides it into two
portions. The lower part of the muscle is covered by the
sterno-mastoid, and it is crossed by the anterior jugular vein.
Its principal deep relations are the lower part of the common
carotid artery and the sterno-thyreoid muscle, which separates
it from the lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland. It is supplied
by branches from the ansa hypoglossi.
Musculus Sternothyreoideus.—This muscle lies under cover
of the preceding and is both broader and shorter. It springs
from the posterior aspect of the manubrium sterni and from
the cartilage of the first rib. Diverging slightly from its
fellow as it ascends, it is inserted into the oblique line on
the lateral face of the lamina of the thyreoid cartilage. An
incomplete tendinous intersection may sometimes be noticed
interrupting its muscular fibres. The nerve supply is derived
from the ansa hypoglossi. In the neck it is covered in the
greater part of its extent by the sterno-hyoid; but the posterior
part of its insertion is covered by the anterior belly of the
omo-hyoid; and the lower and anterior part is covered by skin
and fascia only. The nerve supply is derived from the ansa
hypoglossi.
Musculus Thyreohyoideus.—This muscle lies on the same
plane as the sterno-thyreoid, and may be regarded as its
upward continuation. It takes origin from the oblique line
on the outer surface of the lamina of the thyreoid cartilage,
and is inserted into the lower border of the great cornu of
the hyoid bone under cover of the omo-hyoid muscle. It
conceals part of the lamina of the thyreoid cartilage and
the lateral part of the thyreo-hyoid membrane, and the
aperture in the membrane through which the laryngeal branch
of the superior thyreoid artery and the internal laryngeal
nerve enter the pharynx. It is supplied by a twig from the
hypoglossal nerve.
Dissection.—The dissectors of the head and neck should now proceed to
study the relations of the common carotid and subclavian arteries, the
cervical part of the thoracic duct, and the dome of the pleura, before these
are disturbed by the dissectors of the thorax. Whilst this is being done,
the omo-hyoid must be retained in position, but the upper and lower portions
of the other infra-hyoid muscles may be turned upwards and downwards
respectively.
Remove the remains of the fascial sheath from around the common
carotid artery and the adjacent part of the internal jugular vein. Separate
the vein from the artery and clean the portion of the vagus nerve which
lies between them on a posterior plane. Note that on the right side the
nerve crosses the anterior surface of the subclavian artery, and there gives
off its recurrent branch ; and that on the left side it lies medial to the sub-
clavian artery on an anterior plane.
After the lower parts of the vagi have been cleaned, look for the terminal
part of the thoracic duct on the left side and for the right lymphatic duct on
the right side. In seeking for the thoracic duct pull the lower end of the
left internal jugular vein aside and displace the common carotid artery
anteriorly; then look for the duct as it turns laterally from the border of
the cesophagus a little below the level of the cricoid cartilage; trace it
posterior to the internal jugular vein to its termination in the commence-
ment of the innominate vein. On the right side look for the right lymphatic
duct entering the innominate vein in the angle of union of the internal
jugular and subclavian veins. Next look for the cervical portion of the
sympathetic trunk, which descends posterior to the common carotid. Clean
the nerve trunk carefully and clean also the inferior thyreoid artery, which
crosses anterior or posterior to it, at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Dis-
place the common carotid laterally, and in the angle between the borders
of the trachea and the cesophagus find the recurrent branch of the vagus;
trace it upwards to the point where it disappears under cover of the lateral
lobe of the thyreoid gland, and downwards to the subclavian artery.
Arteria Carotis Communis.—The common carotid arises
differently on the two sides. On the right side it springs
from the termination of the innominate artery, behind the
sterno-clavicular joint, and on the left side from the aortic
arch in the superior mediastinum. The left artery ascends
to the back of the left sterno-clavicular articulation. From
the sterno-clavicular joint each common carotid artery runs
upwards, posteriorly, and slightly laterally to the upper border
of the thyreoid cartilage, which lies opposite the disc
between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae; and there it
ends by dividing into its two terminal branches—the internal
and the external carotid arteries.
Superficial Relations.—Above the level of the anterior
belly of the omo-hyoid the common carotid artery is covered
by the skin, the superficial fascia and the platysma, the deep
fascia and the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid. It is
crossed immediately above the omo - hyoid by the sterno-
mastoid branch of the superior thyreoid artery and, at a higher
level, by the superior thyreoid vein; and it is overlapped by
the anterior margin of the internal jugular vein. In the
lower part of its extent it lies more deeply: its superficial
relations are the skin and superficial fascia, the deep fascia
and the sterno-mastoid; the anterior jugular vein, crossing
transversely, deep to the sterno-mastoid and above the upper
HEAD AND NECK
border of the clavicle; the omo-hyoid, the sterno-hyoid, and
the sterno - thyreoid muscles. Deep to the muscles, the
branches of the ansa hypoglossi descend in front of its
sheath; and the middle thyreoid vein crosses it to join the
internal jugular vein.
Posterior to it lie the transverse processes of the cervical
vertebra? and the origins of the longus colli, longus capitis
(O.T. rectus capitis anticus major), and the scalenus anterior.
The inferior thyreoid artery crosses posterior to it at the level
of the cricoid cartilage; and the vertebral artery lies between
it and the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra.

posterior to it, immediately above its origin; and on the left
side the thoracic duct turns laterally behind it, between it
and the vertebral artery.
To its medial side, below, lie the trachea and oesophagus,
with the recurrent nerve in the angle between their adjacent
borders; and to the medial side of its upper part are the
larynx and pharynx. The lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland
lies either medial to the artery, separating it from the
oesophagus, pharynx, trachea, and larynx, or it forms a direct
anterior relation (Figs. 97, 101). Between its upper extremity
and the inferior constrictor muscle of the pharynx lies the
carotid body. As a rule, the terminal divisions are the only
branches of the common carotid, but occasionally the
superior thyreoid or .the ascending pharyngeal artery arises
from it, instead of from the external carotid. This is more
especially the case when the division of the common carotid
takes place at a higher level than usual.
Carotid Body.—This is a little oval, reddish-brown body, placed upon
the deep aspect of the common carotid artery at the point where it
bifurcates. To expose it, therefore, the vessel must be twisted round in
such a manner that its posterior surface comes to look forwards. It is
closely connected with the sympathetic filaments which twine around the
carotid vessels; and in structure it is similar in its nature to the minute
coccygeal body, which rests upon the anterior aspect of the coccyx. It is
included, therefore, in the group of ductless glands. Entering it are
numerous minute arterial twigs, which take origin from the termination of
the common carotid and the commencement of the external carotid. The
function of this remarkable little body is quite unknown. Most likely it
is a vestigial structure.

Arteria Subclavia.—The relations of the third part of the
subclavian artery were examined during the dissection of the
posterior triangle (p. 151). Those of the first and second parts
must now be studied. On the right side a small portion of the
first part is already exposed between the lower ends of the
internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery; the
remainder can be seen if the internal jugular vein is drawn
aside. On the left side the first part of the artery is concealed
by the commencement of the innominate vein, which must be
pushed aside. On both sides the second part of the artery
lies posterior to the scalenus anterior, which must be left in
position.

to the medial margin of the scalenus anterior; the second
portion lies posterior to that muscle; and the third part
extends from the lateral border of the scalenus anterior to
the outer border of the first rib.
First Part.—Owing to the difference of origin, the relations
of the first portion of the subclavian artery are not the same
HEAD AND NECK
on the two sides of the body. The first part of the right
subclavian extends obliquely upwards and laterally, and at its
termination at the medial margin of the scalenus anterior
it has reached a point above the level of the clavicle. It is
placed very deeply. Anteriorly, it is covered by the skin,
superficial fascia, platysma, deep fascia, and three muscular
strata—viz., the clavicular origin of the sterno-mastoid, the
sterno-hyoid, and the sterno-thyreoid. Three veins and some
nerves are placed anterior to it. At the medial margin of
the scalenus anterior it is crossed by the internal jugular
and vertebral veins, whilst the anterior jugular vein, as it
passes laterally under cover of the sterno-mastoid, is separated
from it by the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyreoid muscles. The
nerves which cross anterior to it are the vagus, a loop from
the sympathetic (ansa subclavia), and in some cases cardiac
branches of the vagus and sympathetic as they run to the
thorax. At the lower margin of the artery the vagus nerve
gives off its recurrent branch.
The cervical dome of the pleura is both below and posterior
to the artery, and the recurrent branch of the vagus nerve
hooks round below and ascends posterior to it.1
On the left side, the first part of the subclavian ascends
almost vertically from its origin from the aortic arch, and,
reaching the root of the neck, it curves laterally across the
dome of the pleura to the medial margin of the scalenus
anterior. The relations of the cervical part are somewhat
different from those on the right side. The same fascial
and muscular layers, and the same nerves and veins, are
anterior to it. Owing to its different direction, however, the
nerves and veins are placed more or less parallel to it. Three
additional relations are established—viz., the phrenic nerve and
the left innominate vein lie anterior to it; and the thoracic
duct first passes upwards in relation to its medial or right
side, and then arches over it to reach the angle of junction
between the subclavian and internal jugular veins.
The recurrent nerve on the left side hooks round the arch
of the aorta, and lies to the medial side of the subclavian
artery.
Second Part.—The second portion of the subclavian artery
1 If the lung has been removed by the dissector of the thorax the lower
and posterior relations should be verified by examination from the thoracic
side.
forms the highest part or summit of the arch, and rises from
half an inch to an inch above the level of the clavicle.
In this part of its course the vessel is not so deeply
placed. Anteriorly it is covered by—(1) skin; (2) superficial
fascia and platysma; (3) deep fascia; (4) clavicular head
of the sterno-mastoid; (5) scalenus anterior. The phrenic
nerve on the right side is also an anterior relation, but it is
separated from the artery by the medial margin of the
scalenus anterior. Posteriorly and inferiorly, the vessel is in
relation with the pleura, Sibson's fascia intervening. The
subclavian vein lies at a lower level than the artery and on
an anterior plane, and is separated from it by the scalenus
anterior.
The third part of the subclavian artery is described on
p. 151.
Branches of the Subclavian Artery.—Four branches
spring from the subclavian trunk (Fig. 103). Three take
origin, as a general rule, from the first part of the artery
close to the scalenus anterior, and one from the second part.
They are—
In a great number of cases a branch of considerable size will be
observed springing from the third part of the subclavian artery. This,
in all probability, is the descending branch of the transverse cervical,
arising directly from the subclavian. It is so common an occurrence that
the dissector must always be prepared to meet it.
Arteria Vertebralis.—This is the first branch which is
given off by the subclavian. It springs from the upper and
posterior aspect of the trunk about a quarter of an inch from
the medial margin of the scalenus anterior on the right side,
and from the point where the vessel reaches the root of the
neck on the left side. Only a small portion of it is seen in
the present dissection. It proceeds upwards in the interval
between the longus colli and the scalenus anterior muscles,
posterior to the common carotid, and disappears into the
foramen transversarium of the transverse process of the sixth
cervical vertebra. It is placed very deeply, and is covered

HEAD AND NECK
anteriorly by its companion vein and the common carotid
artery. Numerous large sympathetic twigs accompany it.
The vertebral artery on the left side is posterior to the
internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery, and it
is crossed by the thoracic duct.
The vertebral vein issues from the aperture in the transverse
process of the sixth cervical vertebra. It passes downwards,
antero-lateral to its companion artery, and posterior to the
internal jugular vein, to open into the posterior aspect of the
commencement of the corresponding innominate vein. Near
its termination it crosses the subclavian artery. It receives
the deep cervical and the anterior vertebral veins.
Truncus Thyreocervicalis (O.T. Thyroid Axis).—This is
a short wide trunk, which arises from the anterior aspect
of the subclavian artery, close to the medial margin of the
scalenus anterior, and under cover of the internal jugular vein.
It lies between the phrenic and vagus nerves, and almost
immediately breaks up into its three terminal branches—viz.,
the inferior thyreoid, the transverse scapular, and the transverse
cervical.
Arteria Thyreoidea Inferior.—This vessel takes a sinuous
course to reach the thyreoid gland. At first, it ascends for
a short distance along the medial border of the scalenus
anterior, and under cover of the internal jugular vein; then,
at the level of the cricoid cartilage, it turns suddenly medial-
wards and passes posterior to the sympathetic, the vagus, and
the common carotid artery, to the posterior border of the
thyreoid gland, where it gives off branches to the larynx and
then descends along the posterior border of the gland, dis-
tributing branches to its substance and to the trachea and the
oesophagus.
The following branches will be noticed arising from the
inferior thyreoid artery :—
Arteria Cervicalis Ascendens.—This small but constant vessel
runs upwards in the interval between the scalenus anterior
and longus capitis, and gives branches to the muscles in
front of the vertebral column. It also gives off spinal branches,
which enter the vertebral canal upon the spinal nerves, and

anastomose with branches from the vertebral artery. The
ultimate distribution of the spinal branches has been noticed
already (p. 193).
Arteria Laryngea Inferior.—This small vessel accompanies
the inferior laryngeal nerve to the larynx. The tracheal, oesopha-
geal, and pharyngeal branches supply the trachea, the gullet,
and the pharynx. They are of small size, and anastomose
with the bronchial and oesophageal branches of the thoracic
aorta. The glandular branches are usually two in number.
One ascends upon the posterior aspect of the lateral lobe of
the thyreoid gland, whilst the other is given to its base or
lower end. They inosculate with the corresponding vessels
of the opposite side, and also with the branches of the
superior thyreoid artery. The muscular branches are a series
of irregular twigs given to the various muscles in the
neighbourhood.
Vena Thyreoidea Inferior.—The inferior thyreoid vein does
not run in company with the artery of the same name. It is a
comparatively large vessel which comes from the lateral lobe
and the isthmus of the thyreoid gland, and descends upon
the trachea under cover of the sterno-thyreoid muscle. The
veins of both sides enter the thorax, and frequently unite to
form a short common stem, which opens into the left in-
nominate trunk. In other cases, however, the right vein
will be observed to open separately into the angle of union
between the two innominate veins. Both veins, as they
proceed downwards, receive tributaries from the larynx,
trachea and oesophagus.
The anterior vertebral vein accompanies the ascending
cervical artery, and opens into the vertebral vein as it issues
from the foramen transversarium of the sixth cervical vertebra.
The Transverse Scapular and Transverse Cervical Arteries.
—Both of these arteries have already been examined in the
greater part of their courses (p. 147). After taking origin
from the thyreo-cervical trunk, they both pass laterally across
the scalenus anterior muscle and the phrenic nerve under
cover of the clavicular head of the sterno-mastoid. The
transverse scapular crosses the anterior scalene muscle close
to its insertion, immediately above the subclavian vein; the
transverse cervical is placed at a slightly higher level.
The transverse scapular and transverse cervical veins have
already been seen joining the external jugular vein.
HEAD AND NECK
Arteria Mammalia Interna.—The internal mammary artery
springs from the lower and anterior aspect of the subclavian,
directly below the thyreo-cervical trunk. It passes downwards
upon the anterior surface of the pleura, posterior to the medial
end of the clavicle and the medial end of the subclavian vein,
to reach the thorax. As it lies posterior to the subclavian
vein the phrenic nerve passes from the lateral to the medial
side, either anterior or posterior to it. In the neck the in-
ternal mammary artery is not accompanied by a vein.
Truncus Costocervicalis.—This branch takes origin from
the posterior aspect of the second portion of the subclavian
artery, close to the medial border of the scalenus anterior.
On the left side, however, it proceeds, as a rule, from the
first part of the parent trunk. To bring it into view the
subclavian artery must be dislodged from its position. It
is a short trunk which passes upwards and posteriorly over
the apex of the pleura to the neck of the first rib, where it
divides into the deep cervical artery and the superior intercostal
artery.
If the lung is removed from the thorax the dissector
should take the opportunity of examining this artery from the
thoracic aspect.
Arteria Cervicalis Profunda.—This branch passes dorsally
and disappears from view between the transverse process of
the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib.
It has been already noticed in the dissection of the back
of the neck (p. 173).
The deep cervical vein is a large vessel. It joins the
vertebral vein.
Arteria Intercostalis Suprema.—The superior intercostal
artery turns downwards anterior to the neck of the first rib,
between the first thoracic nerve and the first thoracic ganglion
of the sympathetic. It gives a posterior intercostal branch to
the first space and ends as the posterior intercostal artery of
the second space (Fig. 5).
Vena Subclavia.—The subclavian vein is the continuation
of the axillary vein into the root of the neck. It begins
at the outer border of the first rib, and arches medially
on the anterior surface of the lower end of the scalenus
anterior. At the medial margin of this muscle, and posterior
to the sternal end of the clavicle, it joins with the internal
jugular to form the innominate vein. In connection with
the subclavian vein note: (1) that the arch which it forms
is not so pronounced as the arch of the corresponding
artery; (2) that throughout its whole course it lies at a
lower level, and upon a plane anterior to the artery; and
(3) that it is separated from the artery by the scalenus
anterior and the phrenic nerve. In the whole of its course
the vein lies posterior to the clavicle.
The sheath of the subclavian vein is attached to the posterior surface of
the costo-coracoid membrane. This is a relation of some practical import-
ance ; for, on account of it, a forward movement of the clavicle drags upon
the vein, and in cases where the vessel is wounded there is always a danger
of air being sucked into the vein by such a movement.
The tributary of the subclavian vein is the external jugular
vein, which joins it at the lateral margin of the scalenus
anterior.
Ductus Thoracicus et Ductus Lymphaticus Dexter.-—The
thoracic duct is the vessel by means of which the chyle and
the lymph, derived from by far the greater part of the body,
are poured into the venous system on the left side (p. 106).
Its terminal or cervical portion is displayed in the dissection of
the neck. It is a small, thin-walled vessel, frequently mistaken
for a vein, which enters the root of the neck at the left
margin of the oesophagus. It is there that it should be
sought. At the level of the seventh cervical vertebra it
arches laterally and anteriorly, and then downwards, above
the apex of the pleura, and it enters the innominate vein in the
angle of the union of the internal jugular vein with the
subclavian. As the thoracic duct courses laterally it lies at
a higher level than the subclavian artery, and passes posterior to
the common carotid artery, the vagus nerve and the internal
jugular vein, and anterior to the vertebral artery and vein
and the thyreo-cervical artery or its inferior thyreoid branch;
and as it runs downwards to its termination it is separated
from the scalenus anterior by the transverse cervical and
transverse scapular arteries and the phrenic nerve. Further,
as it approaches the point at which it ends, it crosses the
first part of the subclavian artery.
A valve composed of two segments guards its entrance
into the innominate vein.
Ductus Lymphaticus Dexter.—The right lymph duct is
the corresponding vessel on the right side, but it is a com-
paratively insignificant channel which conveys lymph from a
much more restricted area. It commences in the posterior
mediastinum, where it not uncommonly communicates with
the thoracic duct; and it ascends to the root of the neck on

the right side, where it terminates in the commencement of
the innominate vein by opening into it in the angle of union
of the subclavian and internal jugular veins. As in the case of
the thoracic duct, its orif1ce is guarded by a double valve.
Lymph passes to it from the intercostal glands which lie in
the upper interspaces of the right side, and from the thoracic
visceral glands of the right side. About half an inch from
its termination it is sometimes joined by the right subclavian
and jugular lymph trunks, which convey lymph from the
right upper extremity and the right side of the head and
neck, respectively. Under these circumstances it constitutes
the main lymph drain for the following districts: (1) right
upper limb; (2) right side of the head and neck; (3) upper
part of right thoracic wall; (4) right side of diaphragm
and upper surface of liver; (5) thoracic viscera on right
side of median plane, viz. right side of heart and peri-
cardium and the right lung and pleura. But not uncommonly
the right jugular and subclavian lymph trunks open
separately into the internal jugular, the subclavian, or the
innominate vein.
Cervical Pleura.—The pleural sac of each side, with the
apex of the corresponding lung, projects upwards into the
root of the neck, and the dissector should now examine the
height to which it rises, and the connections which it estab-
lishes (see Figs. 1 and 5). Its height with reference to the
first pair of costal arches varies in different subjects. In
some cases it extends upwards for two inches above the
sternal end of the first rib; in others for not more than one
inch. These differences depend on the degree of obliquity
of the thoracic inlet. Posteriorly, in the majority of cases,
the apex of the pleura corresponds in level with the neck
of the first rib. It forms a dome-like roof for each side of
the thoracic cavity, and is strengthened by a fascial expansion
(frequently termed Sibson's fascia), which covers it completely,
and is attached on the one hand to the transverse process
of the seventh cervical vertebra and on the other to the inner
margin of the first rib.
Note that it is in relation with: (1) the scalenus anterior;
(2) the scalenus medius; (3) the subclavian artery; (4) the
vertebral artery; (5) the costo-cervical trunk; (6) the superior
intercostal artery; (7) the internal mammary artery; (8) the
innominate vein; (9) the vertebral vein; (10) the subclavian
vein; (11) the vagus nerve; (12) the phrenic nerve; (13) the

vein the subclavian artery crosses the dome below its apex.
The internal mammary artery descends from the subclavian,
passes posterior to the subclavian vein, and is crossed, as it
lies behind the vein, by the phrenic nerve, which passes in
some cases anterior to, and in others posterior to the artery.

crosses the apex of the dome; its superior intercostal branch
descends, posterior to the apex, between the first intercostal
nerve on the lateral side, and the first thoracic sympathetic
ganglion on the medial side. The vagus nerve descends
anterior to the medial part of the subclavian artery, and, on
the right side, its recurrent branch turns round the lower
border of the artery; the ansa subclavia lies to the lateral

PAROTID GLAND
259
It is not possible to examine the relations of either the whole of the
internal jugular vein or the external carotid artery, or the whole of the
cervical portion of the internal carotid, until the parotid gland has been
removed, the infratemporal and submaxillary regions have been dissected,
and the posterior belly of the digastric and the styloid process have been
detached and displaced anteriorly. It is important, however, that the
internal jugular vein should be retained in position whilst these parts of
the dissection are being proceeded with; the dissector should therefore
stitch the subclavian vein to the anterior surface of the scalenus anterior,
and the lower part of the internal jugular vein to the first part of the sub-
clavian artery, before proceeding to the study and removal of the parotid
gland.

Glandula Parotis.—The parotid gland is wedged into a
more or less triangular interval, the parotid space, which is
bounded anteriorly by the posterior borders of the masseter,
the ramus of the mandible, and the internal pterygoid, and
postero-medially by the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid,
the mastoid process, the posterior belly of the digastric, the
styloid process, and the stylo-hyoid muscle. The space
extends upwards to the external acustic meatus, and it is
prolonged downwards into the carotid triangle, into which
11—17 a
HEAD AND NECK
the lower extremity of the gland descends for a short
distance beyond the angle of the mandible. The gland,
however, is more extensive than the space and passes for a
varying distance forwards beyond its anterior border over the
superficial surface of the masseter.
In accordance with the position which it occupies the
gland may be described as possessing three surfaces, two
extremities, and four borders. The surfaces are superficial
or lateral, postero-medial, and antero-medial; the extremities,
upper and lower; the borders, anterior, posterior, medial, and

Posterior border
F1g. 107. — Parotid Gland, lateral view.
superior. The medial border separates the antero-medial
from the postero-medial surface. The ajrterior and posterior
borders separate the lateral surface from the antero-medial
and postero-medial surfaces, respectively. The upper border
intervenes between the upper surface and the other three
surfaces.
The superficial surface is triangular in outline (Fig. 105). It
is covered by skin, superficial fascia, platysma and risorius, and
deep fascia. Embedded in it are a few superficial parotid
lymph glands, which receive lymph from the anterior part of
the scalp, the face above the level of the mouth, and from
the lateral surface of the auricle. Posteriorly, it is in
relation with the mastoid process and the anterior border of
261
the sterno-mastoid muscle. Above, it touches the posterior
part of the lower border of the zygoma and the lower surface
of the external meatus.
From beneath the part in contact with the zygoma emerge
the auriculo-temporal nerve, the temporal branches of the
facial nerve, and the superficial temporal artery, on their way to
the scalp; and the posterior facial vein disappears under cover
of it. Its lower extremity, which is wedged between the angle
of the mandible and the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid,
is usually in contact with one of the upper deep cervical
glands, whilst the posterior facial vein, the commencement of
the external jugular vein, and the cervical branch of the facial
nerve emerge from it; the former passing downwards and
posteriorly, and the two latter downwards and anteriorly.
From beneath the anterior border, which rests upon the
masseter, the duct of the gland (Stensen's), the transverse
facial artery, and the zygomatic, buccal, and mandibular
branches of the facial nerve pass forwards; and the transverse
facial vein disappears under cover of it.
The duct of the parotid gland (Stensen's), after appearing
from under cover of the anterior border of the gland, runs
anteriorly across the masseter, at the level of a line drawn
from the lobule of the auricle to a point situated midway
between the red margin of the upper lip and the ala of
the nose. At the anterior border of the masseter it turns
inwards, at right angles to its former course, and after piercing
the sucking pad of fat, the buccinator fascia, the buccinator
muscle and the mucous membrane of the vestibule of the
mouth, it opens into the vestibule, on the apex of a papilla,
opposite the second molar tooth of the maxilla.
Immediately anterior to the anterior border of the gland,
below the zygoma and above the duct, lies a small separated
portion of the gland substance called the accessory parotid; its
duct opens into the main duct.
Dissection.—The gland must be removed piecemeal as the structures
which pass through it are dissected out. The facial nerve and its branches
are the most superficial structures in the substance of the parotid; therefore
they must be dissected first. Trace the terminal branches posteriorly into
the gland until they join the main divisions, which are the upper or tempore-
facial and the lower or cervico-facial. The temporal and zygomatic branches
spring from the temporo-facial division, the buccal, mandibular, and cervical
from the cervico-facial division. Follow the divisions posteriorly across
the posterior facial vein to their union with the trunk of the nerve, which
pierces the postero-medial surface of the gland; then trace the trunk across
11—17 6
HEAD AND NECK
the root of the styloid process to the stylo-mastoid foramen and secure the
branch which springs from it to supply the posterior belly of the digastric
and the stylo-hyoid muscles, and the posterior auricular branch. As the trunk
of the nerve is being cleaned the posterior auricular branch of the external
carotid artery will probably be exposed, passing upwards and posteriorly
along the upper border of the posterior belly of the digastric to the back of
the external meatus, and crossing either superficial or deep to the nerve.
Next, remove the deeper parts of the gland and expose,the posterior facial
vein, descending towards the angle of the mandible. It receives the trans-
verse facial and the internal maxillary veins, and it gives off the commence-
ment of the external jugular vein ; and then it passes out of the lower end of
the gland and unites with the anterior facial vein to form the common facial
vein. Deep to the veins will be found the upper end of the external
carotid artery dividing into its superficial temporal and internal maxillary
branches; and the transverse facial and middle temporal offsets of the
superficial temporal will also be displayed.
When the remains of the deeper part of the gland have been removed,
the styloid process with the origin of the stylo-hyoid muscle, and the
posterior belly of the digastric will be exposed ; and the internal jugular vein
and the internal and external carotid arteries will be seen disappearing
under cover of the digastric. If the occipital artery lies at its lower level,
it also will be noted as it runs upwards and posteriorly, along the lower
border of the digastric, crossing superficial to the two large vessels, and
to the accessory nerve, which emerges from under cover of the digastric and
passes downwards and posteriorly across the internal jugular vein.
The dissector should now obtain a gland which has been
removed uninjured from the parotid space, or a cast of a
gland, and proceed to study the relations of the upper end
and the postero-medial and antero-medial surfaces.
The upper extremity presents a deep concavity which is
usually separable into a larger lateral part which lies in
contact with the cartilaginous part of the external meatus,
and a smaller medial part which touches the bony wall of the
meatus (Fig. 109). The anterior boundary of the upper
end forms a sharp ridge, which lies in the narrow interval
between the capsule of the temporo-mandibular articulation
and the front of the external meatus.
The. postero-medial surface is marked by a series of depres-
sions which correspond with the structures in the postero-
medial boundary of the parotid space. Above is a shallow
depression corresponding with the anterior border of the
mastoid process, and below the latter a groove caused by the
anterior border of the sterno-mastoid. More medially is a
shallow depression due to the posterior belly of the digastric
and the stylo-hyoid, and, still more medially and at a higher
level, a sulcus which corresponds with the position of the
styloid process. Below the level of the digastric groove the
postero-medial surface covers portions of the internal jugular
263
vein and the internal and external carotid arteries. The
commencement of the external jugular vein, the posterior
facial vein, and the cervical branch of the facial nerve emerge
from this part of the surface. Immediately above the digastric
groove, close to the medial border, the external carotid enters
the gland; and directly lateral to the upper end of the groove
for the styloid process the facial nerve passes into the gland
substance. The dissector should note that the postero-medial
surface of the gland is separated from the upper parts of the
internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, and from

The medial border of the gland lies in the angle between
the postero-medial and the anterior boundaries of the parotid
space, where the styloid process, the stylo-hyoid muscle, and
the posterior belly of the digastric disappear under cover of
the posterior border of the internal pterygoid muscle; and
from it a process, the pterygoid lobe, usually projects anteriorly,
for a short distance, between the internal pterygoid and the
inner surface of the ramus of the mandible. Through the
base of this process the external carotid passes from the
postero-medial to the antero-medial surface of the gland.
The Antero-medial Surface. — The medial part of the

antero-medial surface is directed anteriorly and lies in relation
with the lower part of the posterior border of the internal
pterygoid, the stylo-mandibular ligament, and the posterior
border of the ramus of the mandible. The more lateral part is
directed medially and rests against the lateral surface of the
masseter. This surface is pierced (1) by the external carotid
artery, (2) the posterior facial and the internal maxillary veins,
(3) all the terminal branches of the facial nerve except the
cervical, and (4) by the duct of the gland.

posterior belly of the digastric it is placed so far anteriorly
that it is also under cover of the posterior border of the
mandible; and it does not emerge from under cover of the
mandible until it reaches the level of the neck of the bone,
where it appears on the antero - medial surface of the
gland and divides into its two terminal branches. Further,
he will now readily recognise the impossibility of studying
the upper end of the cervical part of the internal carotid,
the upper part of the internal jugular vein, and the last
four cerebral nerves, until he is in a position to reflect the
posterior belly of the digastric and the styloid process; and
as both of them are, to a certain extent, under cover of the
TEMPORAL AND INFRATEMPORAL REGIONS 265
mandible it is obvious that the mandible must be removed.
This will be done during the dissection of the temporal and
infratemporal regions, which must now be proceeded with.
TEMPORAL AND INFRATEMPORAL REGIONS.
Fascia Temporalis. — The temporal fascia is a strong
glistening membrane which is stretched over the temporal
fossa, binding down the temporal muscle. Its upper margin
is attached to the upper of the two curved lines which
constitute the temporal ridge on the lateral aspect of the
skull, and anteriorly to the temporal line of the frontal
bone. As it approaches the zygomatic arch, it splits into
two laminae, which are separated from each other by a narrow
interval filled with fat. The two laminae are attached one to
the upper border of the zygomatic arch and the posterior
border of the zygomatic bone, and the other to the medial
surfaces of these two portions of bone. They can readily
be demonstrated by dividing the superficial layer close to its
attachment, and throwing it upwards; by the handle of the
knife the attachment of the deep layer can then be made out.
In the upper part of its extent, the temporal fascia is com-
paratively thin and the fibres of the subjacent muscle may
be seen shining through it; below, it is thicker, and owing
to the fat which is interposed between its laminae, it is
perfectly opaque. It is pierced immediately above the
posterior part of the zygomatic arch by the middle temporal
branch of the superficial temporal artery and by the middle
temporal vein (p. 157).
Musculus Masseter.—The masseter is a massive quadrate
muscle which covers the ramus of the mandible. Its
fibres are arranged in two sets—a superficial and a deep.
The superficial part of the muscle arises from the anterior two-
thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch, and its
fasciculi are directed downwards and posteriorly. The deep
part springs from the whole length of the medial aspect of the
zygomatic arch, and also from the posterior third of its lower
border. Its fibres proceed downwards and anteriorly. Only
a small piece of the upper and posterior part of this portion
appears on the surface. The masseter is inserted into the
lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible, over an area
which extends downwards to the angle, and upwards so as to
include the lateral aspect of the coronoid process.
Dissection. — To display the temporal muscle, and at the same time
expose the nerve and artery of supply to the masseter, make the following
dissection. Divide the deep part of the temporal fascia along the upper
border of the zygomatic arch and remove it. The middle temporal artery
and the zygomatico temporal nerve, which pierce it, must be disengaged
from it and preserved. The zygomatic arch, with the attached masseter,
must next be thrown down by dividing the bony arch anterior and posterior
to the origin of the muscle. First make use of the saw, and then complete
the division by means of the bone forceps. The posterior cut should be
made immediately anterior to the mandibular (O.T. glenoid) fossa and
the head of the lower jaw; the anterior cut must extend obliquely through
the zygomatic bone, from the extreme anterior end of the upper margin of
the arch, downwards and anteriorly to the point where the lower margin
meets the zygomatic process of the maxilla. When the division is com-
pleted, and the nerve and artery to the masseter are divided, the whole
arch and the attached masseter may be readily thrown downwards towards
the angle of the mandible. The fleshy origin of the deep portion of
the masseter from the medial surface of the zygomatic arch can now be
seen. The dissection is frequently complicated by a number of fibres from
the temporal muscle joining this part of the masseter. In turning the
masseter down, its nerve and artery of supply must first be cleaned as
they pass laterally through the incisura mandibulae (O.T. sigmoid notch),
posterior to the tendon of the temporal muscle. Leave the masseter
attached to the angle of the jaw and clean the temporal muscle.
Musculus Temporalis.—The temporal muscle is fan-shaped.
It arises from the whole extent of the temporal fossa, from the
lower of the two lines which constitute the temporal ridge to
the infratemporal crest on the great wing of the sphenoid.
It receives additional fibres also from the deep surface of
the temporal fascia. From this broad origin the fasciculi
converge towards the coronoid process of the mandible.
The anterior fibres descend vertically, the posterior fibres at
first pursue a nearly horizontal course, whilst the intermediate
fasciculi proceed with varying degrees of obliquity. As it
approaches its insertion, a tendon is developed upon its
superficial aspect, and this is inserted into the summit and
anterior edge of the coronoid process. The deep part of the
muscle remains fleshy, and gains insertion to the medial
surface of the same bony prominence by an attachment which
reaches as low down as the point where the anterior margin of
the ramus merges into the body of the mandible. The inser-
tion cannot be fully examined at present; it will be dealt with
later.
Dissection.—Detach the coronoid process from the mandible, and turn
it upwards with the attached temporal muscle. A very oblique cut is
required; it should extend from the centre of the incisura above, down-
wards and anteriorly, to the point where the anterior margin of the ramus
meets the body of the mandible. First use the saw, and then complete
the division with the bone forceps. The buccinator nerve (O. T. long buccal)
and its companion artery are in a position of danger during this dissection,
and must be carefully guarded. They proceed downwards and anteriorly
under cover of the lower part of the temporal muscle, and not infrequently
the nerve traverses its substance. The coronoid process and the temporal
muscle must be thrown well upwards, and the muscular fibres separated,
by the handle of the knife, from the bone forming the lower part of the
temporal fossa. This will bring into view the deep temporal nerves and
arteries as they ascend between the cranial wall and the muscle. This is
the time to follow the middle temporal artery also. It will be noticed to
give branches to the muscle, and it extends upwards upon the squamous part
of the temporal bone. The zygomatico-temporal nerve also should be
traced to the point where it emerges from the minute aperture on the
temporal surface of the zygomatic bone. At this point it lies under cover
of the temporal muscle.
The infratemporal region (O.T. pterygo-maxillary) may now be fully
opened up by removing a portion of the ramus of the mandible. . Two hori-
zontal cuts must be made—one through the neck of the mandible, and the
other immediately above the level of the mandibular (O.T. inferior dental)
foramen. To find the level of the foramen, the handle of the knife should be
thrust between the ramus and the subjacent soft parts, and carried down-
wards. Its progress will soon be arrested by the entrance of the inferior
alveolar vessels and nerve into the foramen, and the lower border of the
instrument will correspond with the line along which the bone should be
cut. Both incisions should be made with the saw, until the lateral table
of the bone is cut through, and then the bone forceps may be employed to
complete the division.
Parts displayed by the above Dissection.—When the fat
and areolar tissue are removed, the pterygoid muscles will
come into view. The external pterygoid extends horizontally
to the neck of the mandible. The internal pterygoid, embrac-
ing the anterior part of the external pterygoid muscle between
its two heads of origin, proceeds downwards and posteriorly
upon the deep surface of the ramus of the mandible. It
bears very much the same relation to the medial aspect of the
ramus that the masseter presents to its lateral surface. The
great blood vessel of the space—the internal maxillary artery
—proceeds anteriorly upon (frequently under cover of) the
external pterygoid muscle. The nerves of the region also will
be found in close relationship to the same muscle. Thus,
emerging from between its upper border and the cranial wall,
at the level of the infratemporal crest, are the masseteric and
the two deep temporal nerves; appearing from under cover of
its lower border are the inferior alveolar and the lingual
nerves; whilst the auriculotemporal nerve is related to its
medial surface posteriorly and the buccinator nerve anteriorly.
HEAD AND NECK
The former appears posterior to the temporo-mandibular joint,
and the buccinator nerve either pierces it or emerges from
between its two heads of origin. The spheno-mandibular
ligament also will be seen. It is the thin strip of membrane
which lies medial to the inferior alveolar nerve.

arises in the infratemporal fossa by two heads, an upper and
a lower. The upper head springs from the infratemporal
ridge and surface of the great wing of the sphenoid; the
lower head takes origin from the lateral surface of the lateral
pterygoid lamina (O.T. external pterygoid plate). The
muscle diminishes in width as it passes posteriorly, and it is
inserted into the fovea pterygoidea on the anterior surface
of the neck of the mandible, and also into the anterior margin
of the discus articularis of the temporo-mandibular articulation.
Musculus Pterygoideus Internus.—The internal pterygoid
also is bicipital at its origin, and its two heads embrace the
origin of the lower head of the external pterygoid. The
superficial and smaller head of the internal pterygoid springs
from the lower and posterior part of the tuberosity of the
maxilla, and also from the lateral surface of the pyramidal
process (O.T. tuberosity) of the palate bone; the deep head,
hidden by the external pterygoid, arises in the pterygoid
fossa from the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid lamina,
and from the surface of the pyramidal process of the palate
bone which appears between the two pterygoid laminae.
The two heads of the muscle unite at the lower margin of the
anterior part of the external pterygoid, and the fibres proceed
downwards with a postero - lateral inclination and gain
insertion into the angle of the mandible, and into the lower
and posterior part of the medial aspect of the ramus as
high as the mandibular foramen.
Arteria Maxillaris Interna.—This vessel is the larger of
the two terminal branches of the external carotid artery. It
takes origin immediately posterior to the neck of the
mandible and proceeds anteriorly to the anterior part of the
infratemporal fossa, where it disappears from view by dipping
between the two heads of origin of the external pterygoid
muscle and entering the pterygo-palatine fossa. It is
divided into three parts for convenience of description. The
first part runs horizontally between the neck of the mandible
and the spheno-mandibular ligament. It lies along the
lower border of the posterior part of the external pterygoid
muscle, and usually crosses the inferior alveolar nerve super-
ficially. The second part extends obliquely upwards and
anteriorly upon the lateral surface of the external pterygoid
muscle, under cover of the insertion of the temporal muscle.
The third part dips between the two heads of the external
pterygoid into the pterygo-palatine fossa.
This is the most frequent arrangement, but it is not
uncommon to find the second part of the artery lying in a
deeper plane, viz. between the internal and external pterygoid
muscles. In that case the vessel makes a bend laterally
between the heads of the external pterygoid muscle, and
appears on its surface before entering the pterygo-palatine
fossa.
The branches of the internal maxillary artery are classified
HEAD AND NECK
according to the portion of the vessel from which they spring.
Only one branch of the third part, viz. the posterior superior
alveolar artery, can be studied in this dissection. Those
arising from the first and second parts are:—
From the F1rst Part.
From the Second Part.
1. Arteria auricularis profunda.
1. Arteria masseterica.
2. Arteria tympanica.
2. Rami pterygoidei.
3. Arteria meningea media.
3. Arteriae temporales profundae.
4. Ramus meningeus accessorius.
4. Arteria buccinatoria.
5. Arteria alveolaris inferior.
The Deep Auricular Artery.—This small vessel pierces
the anterior wall of the external acustic meatus to supply
the skin which lines it, and also the superficial part of the
tympanic membrane.
The Meningeal and Tympanic Branches proceed upwards
under cover of the external pterygoid muscle, and, therefore,
cannot be fully studied until that muscle is reflected.
The Inferior Alveolar Artery arises opposite the middle
meningeal, and runs downwards, upon the spheno-mandibular
ligament, to enter the mandibular foramen. It is generally
accompanied by two venae comites, and it is placed posterior to
the inferior alveolar nerve. Just before entering the foramen,
the inferior alveolar artery gives off the slender mylo-hyoid
branch, which is carried downwards and anteriorly, with the
corresponding nerve, upon the deep aspect of the mandible,
to the digastric triangle of the neck.
The branches from the second part are given off for the
supply of the neighbouring muscles. The Masseteric passes
horizontally, posterior to the temporal muscle, with the nerve
of the same name, and has been seen entering the masseter
muscle. The Pterygoid Branches are irregular twigs to the
pterygoid muscles. The Deep Temporal Branches are two in
number—anterior and posterior; they pass upwards in the
temporal fossa, between the bony wall of the cranium and the
temporal muscle. They supply twigs to the temporal muscle,
and they anastomose with the middle temporal artery. The
Buccinator Branch accompanies the buccinator nerve, and
is distributed to the buccinator muscle and the mucous
membrane of the cheek. It anastomoses with jthe external
maxillary (O.T. facial) artery.
The Posterior Superior Alveolar Branch, frorfK^he third part
of the internal maxillary artery, descends upon ihe posterior
aspect of the maxilla, and sends branches through the alveolar
canals of the maxilla for the supply of the upper molar
and praemolar teeth (Fig. 110). Some small twigs go to the
gum and others supply the lining membrane of the maxillary
sinus.
Pterygoid and Internal Maxillary Veins.—The veins in
this region are very numerous, but they cannot be studied
satisfactorily in an ordinary dissection. They constitute a
dense plexus, termed the pterygoid plexus, around the external
pterygoid muscle. Tributaries corresponding to the branches
of the internal maxillary artery open into this network,
whilst the blood is led away from its posterior part by a short
wide trunk, called the internal maxillary vein. This vessel
accompanies the first part of the internal maxillary artery
into the parotid gland, and joins the posterior facial vein
behind the neck of the mandible.
The pterygoid venous plexus is connected with the
cavernous sinus by an emissary vein. It communicates with
the inferior ophthalmic vein, through the inferior orbital fissure,
and with the anterior facial vein by an anastomosing channel
called the deep facial vein which descends across the external
surface of the buccinator muscle.
Articulatio Mandibularis.—Before the external pterygoid
muscle is thrown anteriorly, the temporo-mandibular joint
must be examined. It is a diarthrodial joint of the ginglymus
type, and its cavity is separated into an upper and a lower
part by a discus articularis. In connection with it there are
the following ligaments:—
I
L1gaments Proper.
Accessory L1gaments.
I. Capsule.
1. Spheno-mandibular.
2. Temporo-mandibular.
2. Stylo-mandibular.
D1scos Art1cular1s.
The capsule encloses the joint cavity. Above, it. is attached
posteriorly, laterally, and medially to the margin of the man-
HEAD AND NECK
dibular fossa, and anteriorly to the anterior margin of the
articular tubercle. Below, it is attached to the neck of the
mandible; and between its upper and lower attachments it is
connected with the margins of the discus articularis.
The temporo-mandibular ligament (O.T. external lateral) is
a strong triangular band which is attached above to the
lateral surface of the posterior part of the zygoma and to the
tubercle at the root of the zygoma. Jts fibres run down-
wards and posteriorly to the neck of the /mandible.
The spheno-mandibular ligament (O.T internal lateral) is a
long membranous band which extends from the spine of the
sphenoid to the lingula and to the sharp medial margin of the
Tuberculum articulare

F1G. h1.—Section through Temporo-mandibular Joint,
mandibular foramen. It is not in direct relationship with the
joint. Above, it lies medial to the external pterygoid muscle
and the auriculo-temporal nerve; lower down, the internal
maxillary vessels intervene between it and the neck of the
mandible; whilst, still lower, the inferior alveolar vessels and
nerve are interposed between it and the ramus of the mandible.
The stylo-mandibular ligament has been noticed already. It
is a fibrous band, derived from that portion of the deep
cervical fascia which forms a part of the capsule of the
parotid gland. It is attached above to the styloid process,
and below to the angle and posterior border of the ramus of
the mandible, between the internal pterygoid and masseter
muscles.
An examination of these ligaments will show that very
little is added to the strength of the joint by their presence.
The security of the joint depends not so much upon its liga-
ments as upon the strong muscles of mastication, which keep
the head of the mandible in its place.
The discus articularis is an oval plate of fibro-cartilage, with
its long axis directed transversely. It is interposed between
the condyle of the mandible below and the mandibular fossa
(O.T. glenoid) and the articular tubercle (O.T. eminentia
articularis) above, and it divides the joint cavity into upper
and lower parts, each of which is provided with a separate
synovial lining. To expose the cartilage, the temporo-man-
dibular ligament must be removed. The disc will then be
seen to be adapted to the
two bony surfaces between
which it lies. Above, it is
concavo - convex in corre-
spondence with the tuber-
culum articulare and the
mandibular fossa of the tem-
poral bone; whilst below, it
is concave, and fits upon
the upper aspect of the con-
dyle of the mandible. In
the centre it is thin, and in
some cases it is perforated.
Its circumference is thick,
more especially posteriorly.
It should be noted also that
the external pterygoid muscle is partly inserted into its
anterior border.
The synovial stratum which lines the capsule enclosing the
upper cavity of the joint is of greater extent and looser than
that of the lower compartment. This is in association with
the larger size of the articular surface of the temporal bone
as contrasted with the condylar surface.
Movements. — The movements which the mandible can perform at
the temporo-mandibular joint are the following: — (1) depression; (2)
elevation; (3) protraction; (4) retraction; (5) lateral or chewing move-
ments. When the mandible is depressed the discus articularis and the
condyle move anteriorly on the mandibular fossa, and the condyle finally
takes up a position on the tuberculum articulare. This forward gliding
of the disc and condyle in the upper compartment of the joint is accom-
panied by another movement in the lower compartment of the joint,

positions occupied by the head of the

as the mouth is opened and closed.
HEAD AND NECK
which consists in a rotation of the condyle of the mandible on the
lower surface of the articular disc. Elevation of the mandible or closure
of the mouth is brought about by a reverse series of changes in both
compartments of the joint. Whilst these movements are going on, the
mandible rotates around a transverse axis which traverses the bone in
the neighbourhood of the mandibular foramen. This is the point, there-
fore, of least movement, and consequently in opening and shutting the
mouth the inferior alveolar vessels and nerves are not unduly stretched.
In protraction and retraction the movement is chiefly confined to the
upper compartment of the joint, and the condyle of the mandible with
the articular disc glides anteriorly and posteriorly upon the temporal
articular surface. In the lateral movements of the jaw the mandible is
carried alternately from side to side, as in the process of chewing.
The muscles on each side which are chiefly engaged in producing these
movements are the following:—(1) depressors—the platysma, the mylo-
hyoid, and the anterior belly of the digastric; (2) elevators—the masseter,
internal pterygoid, temporal; (3) protractors—the external pterygoid, and
to some extent the internal pterygoid and the superficial fibres of the
masseter; (4) retractor—the posterior fibres of the temporal and the deep
fibres of masseter; (5) lateral movement is produced by the muscles of
opposite sides acting alternately.
Reflection of External Pterygoid.—The condyle of the mandible must
now be disarticulated and thrown anteriorly with the attached external
pterygoid muscle. It is well to detach the discus articularis with the
head of the bone, in order that it may be more thoroughly examined.
Care must be taken not to injure the auriculotemporal nerve, which lies
in close proximity to the medial aspect of the joint. When the dis-
articulation is complete, the muscle may be displaced anteriorly by gently
pushing the condyle under the internal maxillary artery.
The reflection of the external pterygoid muscle brings into view, after
a little dissection, the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve,
emerging from the foramen ovale, and breaking up into its branches of
distribution. The slender chorda tympani will be found proceeding down-
wards and anteriorly to join the lingual nerve; and the middle meningeal,
tympanic, and accessory meningeal arteries may be traced to the points
where they leave the infratemporal region.
Arteriae Meningea Media et Tympanica and Ramus Menin-
geus Accessorius.—The middle meningeal artery has already
been seen arising from the first part of the internal maxillary
artery. It proceeds upwards, medial to the external ptery-
goid muscle and lateral to the tensor palati, and disappears
from view through the foramen spinosum, by which it enters
the cranial cavity (p. 212). It is usually embraced by the
two roots of the auriculo-temporal nerve.
The accessory meningeal artery and the tympanic artery generally arise
from the middle meningeal. The accessory meningeal inclines anteriorly and
upwards, and enters the cranial cavity by passing through the foramen
ovale; the tympanic runs upwards and posteriorly, and reaches the
tympanum by passing through the petro-tympanic fissure (O.T. Glaserian).
In the tympanic cavity it anastomoses with the styloid-mastoid branch of
the posterior auricular artery.
Nervus Mandibulaxis.—The mandibular branch of the
trigeminal nerve arises within the cranium from the semilunar
(O.T. Gasserian) ganglion, and enters the infratemporal
region through the foramen ovale. It is composed of
sensory fibres, but it is accompanied through the foramen
by the small motor root of the trigeminal nerve; and by the
union of the sensory and motor parts, immediately after
they gain the exterior of the cranium, a mixed nerve-trunk

results. This nerve-trunk lies medial to the external pterygoid
muscle and lateral to the tensor palati, and after a very short
course (not exceeding 5 mm.) it ends by dividing into
two parts, named the anterior and posterior divisions of the
mandibular nerve (Fig. 113).
The trunk of the mandibular nerve gives off two branches
before it divides, viz., (1) nervus spinosus (O.T. recurrent nerve),
and (2) the nerve to the internal pterygoid muscle.
The nervus spinosus is a very slender twig which enters
11—18 a
HEAD AND NECK
the cranium by accompanying the middle meningeal artery
through the foramen spinosum. It supplies the dura mater.
The nerve to the internal pterygoid will be found passing
under cover of the posterior border of the internal pterygoid
muscle at its upper end. In close relation to the root of
this nerve is the otic ganglion.
From the two terminal divisions of the mandibular
trunk the chief branches of distribution arise. The anterior
division is much the smaller of the two, and is composed almost
entirely of motor fibres derived from the motor root of the
trigeminal nerve. The only sensory fibres which it contains
are those which form the buccinator nerve. It gives off the
following branches:—
1. Masseteric. I 3. External pterygoid.
2. Two deep temporal. I 4. Buccinator.
The large posterior division is chiefly sensory. It contains
only a very few fibres from the motor root, and these are
prolonged into its inferior alveolar branch, and afterwards
come off in the form of the mylo-hyoid nerve. The branches
of the posterior division are: (1) auriculo-temporal; (2)
inferior alveolar; (3) lingual.
Nervus Massetericus.—The masseteric nerve runs hori-
zontally above the external pterygoid muscle, and, passing
through the incisura mandibula? (O.T. sigmoid notch)
posterior to the temporal muscle, it enters the posterior and
upper part of the deep surface of the masseter. Before
reaching the masseter it gives one or two twigs to the
temporo-mandibular joint.
Nervi Temporales Profundi. — There are usually two
deep temporal nerves, anterior and posterior. The posterior
nerve is the smaller of the two; it frequently arises by a
common root with the masseteric. Both deep temporal
nerves pass laterally above the external pterygoid, and then
turn upward on the medial wall of the temporal fossa. They
supply the temporal muscle.
Nervus Buccinatorius.—The buccinator nerve (O.T. long
buccal) is the largest of the branches arising from the
anterior division of the mandibular nerve. It proceeds
laterally between the two heads of the external pterygoid
muscle, and then runs downwards and anteriorly under
cover of the temporal muscle, and under cover of the anterior
border of the masseter also, to reach the outer surface of the
buccinator muscle. There it unites with branches of the
facial nerve to form the buccal plexus, from which branches are
distributed to the mucous membrane and skin of the cheek.
The buccinator nerve is a sensory nerve, and all the sensory
fibres in the anterior division of the mandibular nerve
enter into its composition. A few motor fibres, however,
are also prolonged into it; these come off from it in two
branches, viz., (1) in the nerve to the external pterygoid,
which, as a rule, arises in common with the buccinator nerve;
and (2) in a third twig of supply to the temporal muscle. This
temporal branch springs from the buccinator nerve, after it has
reached the lateral surface of the external pterygoid, and
proceeds upwards to supply the anterior part of the temporal
muscle (Fig. no). In some cases the buccinator nerve
pierces the temporal muscle instead of passing under cover of it.
Nervus Auriculo - Temporalis.—The auriculo - temporal
nerve springs by two roots from the posterior division of
the mandibular nerve, under cover of the external pterygoid.
The two roots are composed of sensory fibres and each
receives a communication from the otic ganglion, by means of
which it is brought indirectly into association with the glosso-
pharyngeal nerve. The roots embrace the middle meningeal
artery, and unite posterior to it to form a stem which runs
posteriorly between the neck of the mandible and the
spheno-mandibular ligament. At the interval between the ear
and mandible it turns upwards, in relation to the deep surface
of the parotid gland, crosses the zygoma in company with
the superficial temporal artery, and enters the scalp, where it
breaks up into terminal branches.
Its branches are: (1) one or two strong branches of
communication to the temporo-facial nerve; (2) a few slender
filaments which enter the posterior aspect of the temporo-
mandibular joint; (3) some twigs to the parotid gland; (4)
terminal filaments to the skin over the temporal region arid
summit of the head; (5) auricular branches.
The auricular branches are usually two to the skin lining
the interior of the external meatus, and two to the integument
over the upper and anterior part of the auricle. The former
gain the interior of the meatus by passing between the osseous
and cartilaginous portions of the canal.
Nervus Alveolaris Inferior.—The inferior alveolar nerve
11—18 b
HEAD AND NECK
(O.T. inferior dental) is the largest branch of the mandibular
nerve. Emerging from under cover of the external pterygoid,
at the lower border of the muscle, it passes downwards upon
the spheno-mandibular ligament and enters the mandibular
foramen. The inferior alveolar artery runs downwards
posterior to it, whilst the lingual nerve is anterior to it
and upon a somewhat deeper plane. The inferior alveolar
is a sensory nerve, but a few fibres from the motor root
are prolonged downwards within its sheath as far as the
mandibular foramen. At this point they come off as the
slender mylo-hyoid nerve.
The mylo-hyoid nerve, accompanied by the artery of the
same name, pierces the spheno-mandibular ligament and
proceeds downwards and anteriorly in a groove upon the
inner surface of the mandible to the digastric triangle. A
narrow prolongation of the spheno - mandibular ligament
bridges over the groove and holds the nerve and vessel in
position. In the digastric triangle the mylo-hyoid nerve has
been dissected already (p. 230). It breaks up into numerous
branches for the supply of two muscles, viz., (1) the mylo-
hyoid, and (2) the anterior belly of the digastric.
Nervus Lingualis.—The lingual nerve is entirely sensory.
In the first part of its course, like the other branches of the
mandibular nerve, it lies medial to the external pterygoid
muscle. As it descends it appears at the lower border of
the muscle. Then it proceeds downwards and anteriorly,
between the internal pterygoid muscle and the mandible, and
enters the submaxillary region, where it will afterwards be
traced to the tongue. It lies anterior to and on a slightly
deeper plane than the inferior alveolar nerve. It gives off
no branches in the infratemporal region, but, whilst still
under cover of the external pterygoid, it is joined at an acute
angle by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve. Not
infrequently, also, a communicating twig passes between it
arid the inferior alveolar nerve.
Chorda Tympani.—This is a slender nerve which arises
from the facial in the canalis nervi facialis (O.T. aqueduct of
Fallopius). It gains the infratemporal region by traversing
the tympanic cavity and appearing through the medial part
of the petro-tym panic fissure (O.T. Glaserian), whence it runs
downwards and anteriorly, medial to the spheno-mandibular
ligament. It is joined by a slender filament from the otic
SUBMAXILLARY REGION 279
ganglion, and it unites with the lingual nerve a short distance
below the upper end of the latter.
Dissection.—The student should now endeavour, by means of a Hey's
saw, a chisel, and the bone forceps, to remove the outer table of the mandible,
and thus open up the mandibular canal.
Structures within the Mandibular Canal.—The mandibular
canal is traversed by the inferior alveolar vessels and nerve,
which give off twigs to the roots of the molar and premolar
teeth. Both the artery and the nerve terminate by dividing
into a mental and incisor branch.
The mental artery and nerve appear on the face through
the mental foramen, and have been examined already; the
incisor artery and nerve pass anteriorly to the symphysis and
send up twigs to the canine and incisor teeth. The vessel
anastomoses in the bone with the corresponding artery of
the opposite side.
The superficial area of the submaxillary region has been
dissected already, under the name of the anterior part of the
digastric triangle (p. 230). It is now necessary to carry the
dissection to a deeper plane, in order to expose a number
of parts in connection with the tongue and floor of the
mouth. The structures thus displayed are :—
1. Submaxillary gland and its duct.
2. Sublingual gland.
3. Side of the tongue, and the mucous membrane of the mouth.
6. Submaxillary ganglion.
7. Lingual artery and veins.
8. Part of the external maxillary artery.
9. Stylo hyoid ligament.
Dissection.—To prepare the part for dissection, it is necessary to throw
back the head to its full extent, and turn it slightly to the opposite side.

HEAD AND NECK
If the stuffing in the mouth has not been previously removed, it should
be taken out now. When this has been done, divide the external maxillary
artery and the anterior facial vein at the point where they cross the lower
border of the mandible. Next detach the anterior belly of the digastric from
its attachment to the anterior part of the medial aspect of the lower border
of the mandible; and then, with the saw, cut through the mandible lateral
to the median plane.1 It is essential that the division of the anterior part
of the mandible should be slightly lateral to the median plane on each
side, in order that the median part of the bone, with the attachments
of the genioid muscles, may be left intact.
After the division of the bone has been completed the lower border of
the lateral part of the mandible must be everted, turned slightly upwards,
and fixed in position with hooks. When this has been done the boundaries
and contents of the submaxillary region can be examined.
Part of the region has already been seen as the digastric portion of the
anterior triangle of the neck, but it will now be obvious that the region
occupied by the submaxillary gland is much more extensive than the
digastric triangle; for, although both are bounded anteriorly and posteriorly
by the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle, the upper
boundary of the digastric triangle is the lower border of the mandible,
whilst the submaxillary region extends upwards to the level of the mylo-
hyoid ridge on the inner surface of the mandible.
After the mandible has been turned upwards the dissector should
proceed, in the first place, to examine the relations of the digastric and
stylo-hyoid muscles, then the mylo-hyoid muscle, and afterwards he must
study the submaxillary and sublingual glands and the deeper structures
which are found in the medial boundary of the submaxillary region.
Musculus Digastricus.—This muscle limits the sub-
maxillary region inferiorly and separates it from the carotid
and submental triangles.
The anterior belly of the digastric springs from the inner
surface of the lower border of the mandible close to the
symphysis; and the posterior belly arises from the mastoid
notch of the temporal boneyDn the medial side of the mastoid
process. "The"two"beTl1es converge upon the upper border of
the hyoid bone, where they are united by an intermediate
tendon, which is attached to the hyoid bone at the junction
of the body with the great cornu, by a strong loop of fibrous
tissue developed from the deep cervical fascia. Posterior to
the loop, through which it plays, the intermediate tendon
passes through the cleft lower end of the stylo-hyoid muscle.
Relations.—The anterior belly is covered by the skin,
superficial fascia and the platysma, and the deep fascia. It
is overlapped by the anterior border of the submaxillary gland,
and its deep surface is in contact with the mylo-hyoid muscle.
Its anterior border is the posterior boundary of the submental
1 If the part is soft and pliable there may be no necessity to make this
division of the bone.
triangle, and its posterior border is the anterior boundary of
the digastric triangle.
The relations of the posterior belly are more numerous
and important. Posteriorly, it is covered by the mastoid
process and the attachments of the sterno-mastoid and
splenius capitis muscles. Between the mastoid process and
the angle of the mandible it forms part of the postero-medial
boundary of the parotid space and is covered by the parotid
gland; next it is covered by the angle of the mandible and
the insertion of the internal pterygoid muscle. As it lies in
the anterior triangle it is covered by the skin, the superficial
fascia and platysma, and the deep fascia; it is crossed by
the anterior facial vein, and is overlapped by the posterior
part of the submaxillary gland.
It is superficial to the internal jugular vein, the internal
and the external carotid arteries, the external maxillary artery,
the middle constrictor of the pharynx, and the lower and
posterior part of the hyoglossus muscle. The accessory
nerve passes posteriorly and downwards between it and the
internal jugular vein, and the occipital artery passes upwards
and posteriorly under cover of its lower border, superficial
to the accessory nerve. The hypoglossal nerve descends
vertically on its deep surface in the angle between the
internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, and
the glosso-pharyngeal nerve passes anteriorly and downwards
between it and the internal carotid. The posterior auricular
artery runs upwards and posteriorly along the posterior part
of its upper border under cover of the postero-medial surface
of the parotid, and the stylo-hyoid muscle descends along the
same border. ^
The posterior belly is supplied by the facial nerve, and the
anterior belly by the mylo-hyoid branch of the inferior alveolar
nerve.
Musculus Stylohyoideus.—The stylo-hyoid muscle is a
small muscular bundle which springs from the posterior
border and lateral surface of the middle third of the styloid
process and descends along the upper border of the posterior
belly of the digastric. It divides below into two slips which
embrace the intermediate tendon of the digastric and are then
inserted into the hyoid bone, at the junction of the great
cornu with the body. Its main relations are practically the
same as those of the posterior belly of the digastric, but it is
HEAD AND NECK
not under cover of the mastoid process, the sterno-mastoid,
and the splenius muscles. It is supplied by the facial nerve. V
Dissection.—Turn the anterior part of the submaxillary gland posteriorly,
and clean the posterior part of the mylo-hyoid muscle, which lies deep to
it. Note that a process, the deep part of the gland, springs from the
medial surface of the superficial part and passes anteriorly, deep to the
mylo hyoid. Dissect the external maxillary artery out of the deep sulcus in
the posterior part of the gland, without injuring its submental branch
which runs anteriorly along the lower border of the mandible; then displace
the posterior part of the gland anteriorly and expose the hypoglossal nerve
immediately above the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and, at a higher
level, the lingual nerve. Both nerves lie on the lateral surface of the
hyoglossus muscle. Hanging from the lower border of the lingual nerve is
the small submaxillary ganglion, from which several branches pass to the
gland. Note again the deep part of the gland, springing from the medial
surface of the superficial part, and also the duct of the gland emerging
from the superficial part of the gland and passing anteriorly, with the
deep part, between the mylo-hyoid muscle laterally and the hyo-glossus
medially. Then study the position and relations of the superficial portion
of the gland. The relations of the deep part will be seen after the mylo-
hyoid is reflected.

consists of a superficial larger portion and a deep smaller
portion. The superficial portion is lodged in a space which
is bounded anteriorly by the anterior belly of the digastric;
posteriorly by the posterior belly of the digastric, the stylo-hyoid,
and the stylo-mandibular ligament; below by the deep fascia
of the neck; and laterally by the inner surface of the body
of the mandible and the lower part of the medial surface of
the internal pterygoid muscle. The fascial relations of the
gland have been described already (p. 226). The dissector
should note now that, in accordance with the contour of the
space in which it lies, he can recognise that the superficial
part of the gland possesses an anterior and a posterior
extremity, and three more or less well-defined surfaces,
inferior, lateral, and medial. The posterior extremity abuts
against the stylo-mandibular ligament, which separates it from
the parotid, and it overlaps the stylo-hyoid and posterior
belly of the digastric. It is cleft by a groove in which
lies the external maxillary artery. The anterior extremity
rests on the anterior belly of the digastric.
The inferior surface is covered by the layer of deep
cervical fascia which extends upwards from the great cornu
of the hyoid bone to the lower border of the mandible; it
is crossed posteriorly, under cover of the deep fascia, by the
283
anterior facial vein. Along its upper border lie the majority
of the submaxillary lymph glands; the external maxillary
artery turns round between it and the lower border of the
mandible at the anterior border of the masseter; and the sub-
mental branch of the external maxillary artery runs anteriorly
in the angle between it and the bone.
The lateral surface is in relation posteriorly with the lower

part of the medial surface of the internal pterygoid, and
anteriorly with the inner surface of the body of the mandible
below the mylo-hyoid ridge. The external maxillary artery,
after it emerges from the groove in the posterior end of the
gland, and before it turns round the lower border of the
mandible, runs anteriorly and downwards between this surface
and the internal pterygoid; and the mylo-hyoid artery and
nerve lie between it and the body of the mandible before
they pass, more anteriorly, to the medial surface of the gland.
HEAD AND NECK
The medial surface is in relation with the mylo-hyoid and
hyoglossus, the lingual nerve and the submaxillary ganglion,
and the hypoglossal nerve. It overlaps the stylo-hyoid
muscle, both bellies of the digastric, and the great cornu of
the hyoid bone; and the deep part of the gland and the duct
both spring from this surface before they pass anteriorly
between the mylo-hyoid and the hyoglossus muscles.
The nerve supply of the gland is derived from the lingual
nerve, the submaxillary ganglion, the sympathetic plexus on
the external maxillary artery; and its vascular supply consists
of small submaxillary branches from the external maxillary
artery.
The relations of the deep part of the gland and the duct
will be investigated after the mylo-hyoid has been reflected.
Dissection.—Displace the superficial part of the gland and the submental
branch of the external maxillary artery posteriorly; cut the mylo-hyoid
vessels and nerve, and turn the anterior belly of the digastric downwards;
then clean the mylo-hyoid muscle and examine its attachments.
Musculus Mylohyoideus. — This is a thin sheet of
muscular fibres, which arises from the mylo-hyoid ridge
upon the inner surface of the body of the mandible, by
an origin which extends from the last molar tooth to the
symphysis. Its fibres are directed downwards, medially,
and anteriorly, and present two different modes of insertion.
The posterior fibres are inserted into the body of the hyoid
bone; these, however, form a comparatively small part of
the muscle. The greater number of the fibres are inserted
into a median raphe, which extends between the symphysis
of the lower jaw and the body of the hyoid bone. The
two mylo-hyoid muscles, therefore, stretch across from one
side of the body of the mandible to the other, in front of the
hyoid bone, and constitute a floor for the anterior part of the
mouth. This floor is frequently termed the diaphragma oris.
The mylo-hyoid muscle is supplied by the mylo-hyoid branch
of the inferior alveolar nerve.
Dissection.—Cut the mylo-hyoid muscle a little below its origin from the
mylo-hyoid ridge and turn it downwards and anteriorly. Whilst doing
this be careful not to injure the mucous membrane of the mouth which
lies in contact with it above.
Parts exposed by the Reflection of the Mylo-hyoid (Fig.
115).—The side of the tongue is now brought into view,
with a number of structures in connection with it. First
note the mucous membrane stretching from the tongue to
the gum of the lower jaw; then identify the various muscles.
The hyoglossus, a portion of which was previously visible
behind the mylo-hyoid, is fully exposed. It is a quadrangular
sheet of fleshy fibres which extends from the hyoid bone to
the side of the tongue. Mark its position, because all the
structures in this region have a more or less intimate relation-
ship to it. Thus, posterior and also superficial to its upper
part, the stylo-glossus muscle will be recognised, whilst anterior

to it are the genio-glossus and the genio-hyoid. The genio-
hyoid muscle occupies the antero-inferior part of the region,
whilst the anterior part of the genio-glossus is seen in the
interval between it and the hyoglossus. Upon the surface of
the hyoglossus, the lingual and hypoglossal nerves, the con-
necting loop between them, the deep portion of the sub-
maxillary gland with the submaxillary duct, and the submaxillary
ganglion are to be dissected. The lingual nerve occupies the
highest level, and passes anteriorly upon the muscle near its
insertion into the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve, with its
vena comitans, crosses it close to the hyoid bone, whilst the
HEAD AND NECK
deep part of the submaxillary gland and the submaxillary duct
(Wharton's) occupy an intermediate place. Although the
submaxillary ganglion is very minute, its relations are so
precise that it is very easily found. By seizing the lingual
nerve and dissecting carefully in the interval between it
and the deep part of the submaxillary gland, the ganglion
will be exposed, and its roots and branches of distribution
made out. Upon the genio - glossus, anterior to the

hyoglossus, the dissector will note the sublingual gland with
its artery of supply. If the stylo-hyoid and the posterior
belly of the digastric are displaced posteriorly, certain
structures will be seen passing under cover of the posterior
margin of the hyoglossus muscle. These are:—(1) the
glossopharyngeal nerve immediately below the stylo-glossus
muscle; (2) the stylo-hyoid ligament a little lower down;
and (3) the lingual artery close to the hyoid bone.
Musculus Hyoglossus.—This isa quadrate, flat muscle which
arises from the whole length of the greater cornu, and also from
287
the body of the hyoid bone. Its fibres pass upwards to the
posterior part of the side of the tongue, medial to the stylo-
glossus. The hyoglossus is supplied by the hypoglossal
nerve.
Musculus Stylo glossus.—The stylo-glossus muscle is an
elongated fleshy slip which takes origin from the anterior aspect
of the styloid process near its tip, and, to a slight extent, from
the upper part of the stylo-hyoid ligament also. Passing down-

wards and anteriorly its fibres may be traced upon the side
of the tongue as far as the tip. Some of them decussate
with the fasciculi of the hyoglossus muscle. The nerve of
supply to the stylo-glossus comes from the hypoglossal.
Musculus Geniohyoideus. — The genio-hyoid muscle is
placed close to the median plane, in contact with its fellow of
the opposite side. It is a short muscle which arises from
the spina mentalis upon the posterior surface of the symphysis
of the mandible, and extends downwards and posteriorly to
gain insertion into the anterior aspect of the body of the
hyoid bone. The hypoglossal nerve supplies the genio-hyoid.
HEAD AND NECK
The Deep Part of the Submaxillary Gland.—It has been
noted already that the small deep part of the submaxillary
gland springs from the medial surface of the superficial part at
the posterior border of the mylo hyoid muscle. It will now be
obvious that it passes anteriorly and upwards, between the
mylo-hyoid laterally and the hyo-glossus and genio-glossus
medially, until it comes into contact with the sublingual gland.
It is accompanied by the lingual nerve and the submaxillary
duct, both of which lie on its medial surface.
Ductus Submaxillaris.—The duct of the submaxillary
gland (O.T. Wharton's duct) emerges from the medial surface
of the main part of the gland, and proceeds, with the deep
part of the gland, anteriorly and upwards upon the hyo-
glossus muscle. At first it lies between the lingual nerve
above and the hypoglossal nerve below. Reaching the
surface of the genio-glossus muscle, it is crossed laterally,
and then below and medially, by the lingual nerve. Then it
passes to the medial side of the sublingual gland, and gains the
floor of the mouth, where it opens by a small orifice placed
on the summit of a papilla which lies close to the side of the
frenulum linguae.
The wall of the duct is much thinner than that of
the parotid duct. If a small opening be made in it, the
dissector will experience little difficulty in passing a fine probe
or bristle along it into the mouth.
G-landula Sublingualis.—The sublingual gland lies in the
floor of the mouth, and is the smallest of the larger salivary
glands. It is almond shaped, about one inch and a half
long; and its relations are very definite. Its prominent upper
border can be seen within the mouth, beneath the anterior
part of the tongue, where it is covered by a fold of mucous
membrane termed the plica sublingualis (Fig. 146). Medially
it rests upon the genio-glossus muscle, whilst laterally it is
lodged in a fossa on the inner aspect of the mandible,
immediately lateral to the symphysis and above the mylo-
hyoid ridge. Below, it is supported by the mylo - hyoid
muscle. Its anterior extremity reaches the median plane,
above the anterior border of the genio-glossus, and is in
contact with its fellow of the opposite side. The duct of
the submaxillary gland and the lingual nerve are prolonged
anteriorly medial to the sublingual gland.
Numerous small ducts (the number varying from eight
to twenty) proceed from the sublingual gland. These, as a
rule, open into the mouth on the summit of the plica sub-
lingualis (Birmingham).
Nervus Lingualis.—In the dissection of the infratemporal
region, the lingual nerve was seen passing downwards between
the ramus of the mandible and the internal pterygoid muscle.
As it descends it inclines anteriorly, and, after passing
over the attachment of the superior constrictor muscle of
the pharynx to the posterior end of the mylo-hyoid ridge,
it lies below and posterior to the last molar tooth between the
mucous membrane of the mouth and the body of the mandible.
At this point it is in danger of being hurt by the clumsy
extraction of one of the lower molars, and here also it may
be divided by the surgeon, from the inside of the mouth.
In its further course the nerve keeps close to the side of
the tongue, crossing the styloglossus and the upper part of
the hyoglossus, and, beyond that, the submaxillary duct.
Its terminal branches are placed immediately under the
mucous membrane of the mouth, and it can be traced as
far as the tip of the tongue.
The branches which proceed from the lingual nerve in the
submaxillary region are of two kinds—(1) twigs of com-
munication; (2) branches of distribution.
(I. Two or more to the submaxillary ganglion.
2. One or two which descend along the anterior
border of the hyoglossus muscle to unite with

\. 3. Branches to the tongue.
The lingual branches pierce the substance of the tongue,
and then incline upwards to supply the mucous membrane
with the papillae over the anterior two-thirds of this organ.
Ganglion Submaxillare.—This is a minute ganglion which
lies upon the upper part of the hyoglossus muscle in the interval
between the lingual nerve and the deep part of the sub-
maxillary gland. In size, it is not larger than the head of a
large pin; and, when freed from the connective tissue surround-
ing both it and its branches, it will be seen to be suspended
from the lingual nerve by two short branches, which enter its
upper border, and are separated by a distinct interval. Of these,
the posterior connecting twig is frequently in the form of two
vol. 11—19
HEAD AND NECK
or three filaments, which convey to the ganglion its sensory
and secretory roots, whilst the anterior connecting branch must
be looked upon as a twig given by the ganglion to the lingual
nerve.
In common with the other ganglia developed in connection
with the branches of the trigeminal nerve, this ganglion has
three roots—viz. (1) a sensory root from the lingual nerve; (2)
a secretory root from the chorda tympani; and (3) a sympathetic
root from the plexus around the external maxillary artery.
From its lower border several minute twigs proceed, and
these are distributed — (1) to the submaxillary gland and
duct; (2) to the sublingual gland from the branch which
it gives to the lingual nerve; and (3) to the mucous mem-
brane of the mouth.
Nervus Hypoglossus.—This nerve has been traced in the
dissection of the anterior triangle to the point where it
disappears under cover of the mylo-hyoid muscle (p. 231).
It is now seen passing anteriorly upon the hyoglossus muscle,
above the hyoid bone and below the level of the deep
part of the submaxillary gland. At the anterior border of
the hyoglossus it gains the surface of the genio - glossus
muscle, into the substance of which it sinks; and finally
it breaks up into branches which supply the muscular sub-
stance of the tongue. Upon the hyoglossus muscle it is
accompanied by a vena comitans.
The branches which spring from the hypoglossal nerve in
this region are very numerous, and are entirely distributed to
muscles. It supplies—(1) the stylo-glossus; (2) the hyoglossus;
(3) the genio-glossus; (4) the genio-hyoid; and (5) the
intrinsic muscles of the tongue.
In addition, it communicates freely with the lingual
nerve. The more apparent of these connections take place
in the form of one or more loops in relation to the anterior
border of the hyoglossus. Other communications with the
same nerve are effected in the substance of the tongue.
Reflection of the Hyoglossus.—The hyoglossus should now be
carefully detached from the hyoid bone, and thrown upwards towards
the tongue. In doing this there is no need to divide the structures
which lie upon its surface. By the reflection of this muscle the follow-
ing structures will be fully displayed—(1) the profunda linguae artery
and the veins which accompany it; (2) the dorsales linguae arteries and
veins; (3) the posterior part of the genio-glossus; (4) the origin of the
middle constrictor of the pharynx; and (5) the attachment of the stylo-
hyoid ligament.
291
Musculus Genioglossus.—This is a flat triangular muscle,
the medial surface of which is in contact with its fellow of
the opposite side in the median plane. It arises by a short
pointed tendon from the upper mental spine on the posterior
aspect of the symphysis of the mandible, and from this its
fleshy fasciculi spread out in a fan-shaped manner. By far
the greater part of the muscle is inserted into the tongue by
an insertion which extends throughout the whole length of
the organ from the tip to the base; below the tongue, a
few fibres reach the side of the pharynx. The genio-glossus
is supplied by twigs from the hypoglossal nerve.
Arteria Lingualis. — As the lingual artery is now fully
exposed, it can be conveniently studied at this stage.
It springs from the anterior aspect of the external carotid,
and is separable into two parts—viz. (1) a part extending
from its origin to the posterior border of the hyoglossus
muscle; (2) a part lying in relation to the upper border of
the hyoid bone and extending to the anterior border of the
hyoglossus, where it divides into two terminal branches, the
sublingual and the deep artery of the tongue.
The first part has been fully examined in a previous
dissection. It lies in the carotid triangle of the neck, and
is therefore comparatively superficial. It is crossed by the
hypoglossal nerve, and lies, medially, against the middle
constrictor. The second part proceeds anteriorly along the
upper border of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, and
is covered by the hyoglossus muscle, which intervenes
between it and the hypoglossal nerve. The nerve, how-
ever, is placed at a slightly higher level. The deep or
medial relations of the artery in this stage of its course
are the middle constrictor of the pharynx and the genio-
glossus.
The branches of the lingual artery are :—
1. Suprahyoid from the first part (p. 233).
2. Dorsalis linguae from the second part.
3. Sublingual.
4. Profunda.
Rami Dorsales Lingua.—The dorsalis linguae is generally
represented by two or more well-marked branches, which
pass upwards, under cover of the hyoglossus muscle, to end
in twigs to the mucous membrane covering the pharyngeal
part of the dorsum of the tongue. Some twigs are supplied
11—19«
HEAD AND NECK
also to the muscular substance of the organ, and a few may
be traced backwards into the tonsil.
Arteria Sublingualis.— This springs from the termination
of the second part and emerges from under cover of the
anterior border of the hyoglossus, and then ascends upon the
genio-glossus to reach the sublingual gland, which it supplies.
It gives branches to the surrounding muscles also; and
it anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side and with
the submental branch of the external maxillary artery.
Arteria Profunda Lingua.—The deep artery of the tongue
ascends almost vertically upon the genio-glossus, overlapped
by the anterior border of the hyoglossus; when it reaches
the under surface of the tongue, it runs towards the tip and
ends in terminal branches. It can easily be exposed by
dividing the mucous membrane along its course, when it will
be seen to lie close to the attachment of the frenulum of
the tongue, and to be continued forwards in the interval
between the genio - glossus and the inferior longitudinal
muscle. Its course is tortuous to allow of the protrusion or
elongation of the organ, and it gives off numerous branches.
Lingual Veins.—The lingual artery is accompanied by
two small venae comites which lie with it under cover of
the hyoglossus; but the main vein of the tongue crosses
the lateral surface of the hyoglossus, and another smaller vein,
the vena comitans hypoglossi, accompanies the hypoglossal
nerve. The venae comites of the artery and the vena comitans
hypoglossi unite with the main vein to form the lingual vein,
which opens into the common facial vein or into the internal
jugular vein.
Stylo-hyoid Ligament.—This is the last structure to be
examined in this dissection. It is a fibrous cord which
springs from the tip of the styloid process and passes
antero-inferiorly to be attached, under cover of the hyo-
glossus muscle, to the lesser cornu of the hyoid bone. It is
not uncommon to find it partially ossified; in other cases
it may assume a ruddy hue and contain muscular fibres.
OTIC GANGLION AND TENSOR PALATI.
During the dissection of the submaxillary region the
dissector has noted a nerve ganglion, the submaxillary ganglion,
connected with the lingual branch of the mandibular nerve,
OTIC GANGLION AND TENSOR PALATI 293
and when he was examining the infratemporal region refer-
ence was made to the otic ganglion, which is associated
with the trunk of the mandibular nerve and the branch which
it supplies to the internal pterygoid muscle. This ganglion
and its connections should now be displayed, and afterwards
the tensor palati muscle should be cleaned and followed from
its origin to the hamulus of the medial pterygoid lamina
Dissection.—Cut the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves immediately
below their origins; evert the upper part of the mandibular nerve and
examine the otic ganglion; then divide the internal pterygoid, along the
posterior border of the lateral pterygoid lamina, depress the lower part of
the muscle and clean the tensor palati, which forms the medial relation
of the middle meningeal artery, the otic ganglion and the mandibular nerve,
separating them from the lateral surface of the auditory tube (Eustachian).
Ganglion Oticum.—This is a minute oval body about
4 mm. in length. It lies immediately below the foramen
ovale, between the mandibular nerve laterally, the tensor veli
palatini medially, and the middle meningeal artery posteriorly;
and it is intimately associated with the origin of the nerve to
the internal pterygoid.
The otic ganglion is usually described as receiving motor, sensory, and
sympathetic roots. The motor root is supplied by the nerve to the internal
pterygoid muscle; the sympathetic root comes from the plexus around the
middle meningeal artery. In addition to these, the small superficial petrosal
nerve enters the posterior border of the ganglion, and conveys to it sensory
fibres.
The following are the branches which proceed from the otic ganglion :—
{A twig which passes downwards and anteriorly to the
tensor veli palatini. (Tensor palati.)
A twig which proceeds upwards and posteriorly to
supply the tensor tympani.

branches. A minute communicating filament to the chorda

Musculus Tensor Veli Palatini.—This flat and band-like
muscle is closely applied to the deep surface of the internal
pterygoid muscle. It arises from the scaphoid fossa at the
root of the medial pterygoid lamina, from the posterior
border of the lower surface of the great wing of the sphenoid,
from the spine of the sphenoid, and from the lateral aspect of
the auditory tube (O.T. Eustachian). It descends to the
lower end of the medial pterygoid lamina and ends in a
tendon which turns horizontally under the hamulus into
the soft palate, where its attachments will be seen later.

THE GREAT VESSELS AND NERVES
OF THE NECK.
As soon as the dissection of the infratemporal and the
submaxillary regions is completed the dissector should turn
to the study of the external carotid artery and its relations.
Arteria Carotis Externa.—The external carotid is one
of the two terminal branches of the common carotid. It
commences therefore at the level of the upper border of the
thyreoid cartilage, opposite the disc between the third and
fourth cervical vertebrae; and, after running upwards and
posteriorly to the level of the neck of the mandible, it
terminates, between that portion of bone and the upper part
of the antero-medial surface of the parotid gland, by dividing
into two terminal branches, the superficial temporal and the
internal maxillary. At its commencement it lies anterior and
medial to the internal carotid; and it is called external not
on account of its relation to the internal carotid, but because
it is distributed mainly to the parts on the exterior of the
skull. It is at first comparatively superficial in the upper
part of the carotid triangle; next it passes under cover of the
lower part of the postero-medial surface of the parotid and the
posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscles.
At the upper border of the stylo-hyoid it enters a groove in
the medial border of the parotid, through which it passes to
the upper part of the antero-medial surface of the gland,
posterior to the neck of the mandible, where it terminates.
Relations.—As it lies in the carotid triangle it is covered
by the skin, superficial fascia and platysma, branches of the
nervus cutaneus colli and the cervical branch of the facial
nerve, and the deep fascia. Beneath the deep fascia it is
crossed superficially by the common facial and lingual veins
and the hypoglossal nerve; and, at the upper end of the
triangle, it is concealed by the lower end of the parotid gland
and it is crossed from behind forwards by the posterior facial
vein. After it leaves the carotid triangle it is overlapped by
the angle of the mandible, and is crossed by the posterior
belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid. At its termina-
tion it is concealed by the upper part of the parotid and is
crossed by branches of the facial nerve.

be seen to greater advantage at a later stage when the styloid
process is detached and displaced. They are the pharyngeal
branch of the vagus, the stylo-pharyngeus, the glossopharyngeal

HEAD AND NECK
nerve, and the styloid process or the stylo-hyoid ligament.
These structures lie to its medial side after they have passed
obliquely between it and the internal carotid, which has
gradually attained a plane posterior and medial to that in
which the external carotid lies.
In the whole of its extent the external carotid is accom-
panied by numerous sympathetic nerve fibres, derived from
the upper cervical sympathetic ganglion; they constitute the
external carotid plexus, which distributes offsets along all the
branches of the artery.
Branches.—The branches of the external carotid artery are
the superior thyreoid, the lingual, and the external maxillary
from its anterior aspect; the occipital and the posterior
auricular from its posterior aspect; the ascending pharyngeal
from its medial side; and the superficial temporal and the
internal maxillary are its terminal branches.
Arteria Thyreoidea Superior.—This vessel arises within
the carotid triangle, from the anterior aspect of the external
carotid close to its origin. It runs downwards and anteriorly,
under cover of the omo-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyreoid
muscles, to the apex of the lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland,
where it ends by breaking up into three terminal branches.
The following branches proceed from it:—
1. Hyoid.
2. Superior laryngeal.
3. Sterno-mastoid.
4. Crico-thyreoid.
5. Glandular.
Ramus Hyoideus.—This is a minute twig, which springs
from the superior thyreoid in the carotid triangle. It runs
along the lower border of the hyoid bone, under cover of the
thyreo-hyoid muscle, and anastomoses with its fellow of the
opposite side, and with the hyoid branch of the lingual
artery.
Arteria Laryngea Superior.—This is a larger vessel. It
springs from the superior thyreoid in the carotid triangle,
and, associating itself with the internal laryngeal nerve, it
enters the pharynx after piercing the thyreo-hyoid mem-
brane.
Arteria Sternocleidomastoidea.—The sterno-mastoid branch
is a small vessel which runs downwards and posteriorly, across
the carotid sheath along the upper border of the anterior
belly of the omo hyoid muscle, to reach the deep surface of
the sterno-mastoid muscle, into which it sinks. It gives,
in addition, minute twigs to the depressor muscles of the
larynx.
Ramus Cricothyreoideus.—The crico-thyreoid artery runs
medially upon the crico-thyreoid ligament, and anastomoses
with its fellow of the opposite side. It has already been
noticed in the dissection of the middle line of the neck
(p. 229).
Rami Glandulares.—The glandular rami are the three
terminal branches. They spring from the main trunk at
the apex of the lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland. The
largest is distributed on the medial surface of the lateral
lobe; the smallest ramifies on its lateral surface; whilst
the third runs downwards upon the anterior border of the
lateral lobe, and then along the upper border of the isthmus
towards its fellow of the opposite side. The anastomosis
between the thyreoid arteries of the two sides is by no means
free.
Vena Thyreoidta Superiores.—The superior thyreoid veins
emerge from the gland and form a trunk which receives
tributaries corresponding in a great measure with the branches
of the artery. It crosses the upper part of the common
carotid and joins the internal jugular vein.
Arteria Lingualis.—The lingual artery springs from the
external carotid at the level of the great cornu of the
Iryoidbone in the carotid triangle. It runs along the upper
the artery of supply to the tongue. It has already been
dissected in the carotid triangle and the submaxillary region,
and the details of its course and relations are given on
PP- 233, 29J-
Arteria Maxillaris Externa (O.T. Facial Artery).—The ex-
ternal maxillary artery can be studied, at the present stage of
the dissection, from its origin up to the point where it mounts
upon the mandible to reach the face. This is termed the
cervical part of the artery. It springs from the anterior aspect
of the external carotid, immediately above the lingual, in
the upper part of the carotid triangle, and passes vertically
upwards, on the lateral surface of the middle constrictor
muscle of the pharynx, to the angle of the mandible, where
it disappears under cover of the posterior belly of the
digastric and the stylo-hyoid muscle. At this point the
superior constrictor is medial to it and separates it from the

cornu.
As its name indicates it is

pharyngeus and stylo-glossus muscles, and will be seen when
the styloid process is reflected.
Ramus Tonsillaris.—The tonsillar branch runs upwards
between the internal pterygoid and stylo-glossus muscles, then
turns medially, pierces the superior constrictor, and enters
the tonsil.
The glandular branches are given to the submaxillary
gland as the external maxillary artery passes through it.
HEAD AND NECK
Arteria Submentalis.—This is a branch of some size. It
arises close to the base of the mandible, and runs towards
the chin upon the mylo-hyoid muscle. Near the symphysis
it changes its direction, and is carried upwards over the border
of the mandible, to end in branches for the muscles and
integument of the chin and lower lip. In the submaxillary
region it gives numerous twigs to the surrounding muscles
and glands, and anastomoses with the sublingual artery by
branches which pierce the mylo-hyoid muscle. It anasto-
moses, in the face, with the inferior labial branch of the
external maxillary and the mental branch of the inferior
alveolar.
Vena Facialis Anterior.—-The cervical portion of the
anterior facial has already been seen (p. 231) passing posteriorly
and downwards, superficial to the submaxillary gland. After
receiving tributaries corresponding to the branches of the
similar part of the external maxillary artery, it joins the
posterior facial vein. The short trunk thus formed is termed
the common facial vein, and it pours its blood into the internal
jugular at the level of the hyoid bone.
Arteria Occipitalis.—The occipital artery springs from the
posterior aspect of the external carotid at the same level as
the external maxillary. It takes the lower border of the
posterior belly of the digastric muscle as its guide, and runs
upwards and posteriorly, under cover of the sterno-mastoid
muscle, and generally under cover of the lower border of the
posterior belly of the digastric, to reach the interval between
the mastoid portion of the base of the skull and the transverse
process of the atlas. Thence onwards it has been studied
in the dissection of the scalp and the back of the neck
(pp. 162, 170). The first part of the vessel crosses the internal
carotid artery, the vagus nerve, the accessory nerve, and the
internal jugular vein, whilst the hypoglossal nerve hooks
round it.
The only branches which spring from this portion of the
occipital are: (1) muscular twigs; and (2) a meningeal
branch.
The muscular twigs are given to the neighbouring muscles,
and one of them, larger than the others and very constant, is
termed the sterno-mastoid branch, runs parallel with the
accessory nerve, and sinks with it into the substance of
the sterno-mastoid muscle.
A meningeal branch associates itself with the internal
jugular vein, and can be followed upwards upon it to
the jugular foramen, through which it passes into the
cranium.
Arteria Auricularis Posterior.—The posterior auricular
artery will be found above the level of the posterior belly of
the digastric, and, like the occipital, it takes origin from the
posterior aspect of the external carotid artery. In the first
part of its course it is placed deeply, and runs upwards and
posteriorly between the styloid process of the temporal bone
and the postero-medial surface of the parotid gland to reach
the interval between the mastoid process and the back of
the auricle. Then it joins the posterior auricular nerve.
Its further course has been studied in the dissection of the
scalp (p. 157).
This portion of the posterior auricular artery gives off
(1) muscular twigs; (2) a few branches to the parotid gland;
and (3) the stylo-mastoid artery.
Arteria Stylomastoidea.—This is a slender vessel which
enters the stylo-mastoid foramen. In the interior of the tem-
poral bone it has an extensive distribution. It supplies twigs
to the mastoid cells and to the tympanic cavity and is carried
onwards in the canalis facialis (O.T. Fallopian) to anastomose
with the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal.
Arteria Maxillaris Interna.—The commencement of the
internal maxillary artery, from the termination of the external
carotid, between the neck of the mandible and the antero-
medial surface of the parotid gland, has been seen already, and
the artery has been traced through the infratemporal region
to the pterygo-palatine fossa, where its terminal branches will
be dissected at a later period.
Arteria Temporalis Superficialis. — Like the internal
maxillary, this artery commences between the neck of the
mandible and the antero-medial surface of the parotid gland.
It passes upwards and, as it emerges from under cover of
the upper end of the parotid, it crosses the posterior end
of the zygomatic arch and enters the superficial fascia of the
scalp, in which it ascends on the superficial surface of the
temporal fascia, and anterior to the auricle it breaks up
into two branches, frontal and parietal. These anastomose
with each other and with their fellows of the opposite
side. The frontal anastomoses with the supra-orbital and
frontal branches of the ophthalmic also, and the parietal
with the posterior auricular and the occipital arteries. Whilst
it is still under cover of the parotid it gives branches to the

gland; anterior auricular branches to the auricle; the transverse
facial, which passes along the lower border of the zygomatic
arch across the masseter. As the superficial temporal crosses
the zygoma it gives off a zygomaticoorbital branch, which runs
to the lateral border of the orbit, and a middle temporal
branch, which perforates the temporal fascia and anastomoses
in the temporal fossa with the deep temporal branches of the
internal maxillary. The course of this branch and also the
distribution of the terminal branches have been followed in
earlier stages of the dissection (pp. 266, 267).
Dissection.—Divide the posterior belly of the digastric immediately
below its origin, and turn it downwards and anteriorly towards the hyoid
bone; then examine the stylo-pharyngeus muscle. It may be necessary to
cut the occipital and posterior auricular arteries in order to gain free access
to the deeper parts, but this should not be done unless it is necessary.
Care must be taken whilst cleaning the stylo-pharyngeus to avoid injuring
the glosso-pharyngeal nerve, which turns round its posterior border and
crosses its superficial surface.
Musculus Stylopharyngeus.—This is the longest of the
three slender muscles which spring from the styloid process.
It arises from its deep or medial surface close to its root, and
extends downwards and anteriorly to gain the side of the
pharynx, where it disappears under cover of the upper border
of the middle constrictor muscle. Whilst under cover of
the middle constrictor its fibres blend with those of the palato-
pharyngeus, and, with these, are inserted into the posterior
border of the corresponding lamina of the thyreoid cartilage.
Some of the fibres, however, are lost in the wall of the pharynx.
If the dissector removes the fascia at the posterior part of
the thyreo-hyoid space he will expose the lower fibres of the
middle and the upper fibres of the inferior constrictor, and
in the interval between them, on a deeper plane, the lateral
surface of the lower part of the stylo-pharyngeus.
Dissection.—Snip through the base of the styloid process with the bone
forceps, and throw it and the attached muscles downwards and anteriorly.
The upper parts of the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein
are now exposed, and the ascending pharyngeal artery can be followed to
the base of the skull.
Arteria Pharyngea Ascendens.—To expose this vessel the
dissector must push the external carotid anteriorly and clean
the interval between it and the internal carotid. The
ascending pharyngeal springs from the medial surface of the
external carotid close to its lower end and is its smallest
branch. It ascends along the lateral border of the pharynx,
lying between the stylo-pharyngeus laterally and the con-
strictors of the pharynx medially, first in a plane between the
external and internal carotid arteries, and then to the medial
side of the internal carotid. As it passes upwards it gives
HEAD AND NECK
pharyngeal branches to the wall of the pharynx and
prevertebral branches to the prevertebral muscles. At
the base of the skull it gives off meningeal branches, which
enter the cranial cavity through the hypoglossal canal, the
jugular foramen, and the foramen lacerum; and palatine
branches, which pierce the pharyngeal aponeurosis above the
upper border of the superior constrictor and descend, along
the levator palati, to the soft palate. Offsets from these
branches are given to the auditory tube (O.T. Eustachian)
and to the tonsil.
Dissection.-—After the ascending pharyngeal artery has been examined,
the internal carotid artery, the glosso-pharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and
hypoglossal nerves, and the superior cervical ganglion, with their various
connections and branches, must be dissected. A dense and tough fascia
envelops these structures, and a great amount of patience is required to
trace the branches of the nerves through it. One nerve—the pharyngeal
branch of the vagus—which proceeds downwards and anteriorly upon the
superf1cial or lateral aspect of the internal carotid, is especially liable to
injury, and must therefore be borne in mind from the very outset of
the dissection. The internal laryngeal and the external laryngeal nerves
have been previously displayed in the anterior triangle of the neck. These,
if traced upwards, will lead to the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus,
which lies in relation with the deep aspect of the internal carotid artery.
Near the base of the skull all the nerve-trunks will be found making
their appearance, close together, in the interval between the internal
jugular vein and the internal carotid artery; whilst posterior to the vein
the rectus lateralis muscle and the first loop of the cervical plexus will be
seen.
Arteria Carotis Interna.—The internal carotid artery is
one of the two terminal branches of the common carotid,
and it commences at the level of the upper border of the
thyreoid cartilage. From this point it proceeds upwards
in the neck, in a vertical direction, until it reaches the
base of the skull; there it disappears from view by entering
the carotid canal of the petrous portion of the temporal
bone, through which it reaches the interior of the cranium.
The internal carotid artery can therefore be very appropri-
ately divided into three parts—viz. (1) a cervical; (2)
a petrous; and (3) an intracranial. The cervical part
alone comes under the notice of the student in the present
dissection.
In the first part of its extent the internal carotid artery
lies in the carotid triangle, and is therefore comparatively
superficial. It is covered by the integument, platysma, and
fascia, and is overlapped by the sterno-mastoid muscle and
the anterior border of the internal jugular vein; it is crossed
by the hypoglossal nerve and the sterno-mastoid branch of the
occipital artery, the lingual and common facial veins; and the

belly of the digastric. The occipital artery crosses it at the
level of the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric,
and the posterior auricular at the level of its upper border.
The relationship of the external carotid artery to the
internal carotid is a varying one. At first the external
carotid lies antero-medial to it; but soon, owing to its in-
clination posteriorly, it comes to lie directly superficial to the
internal carotid. The following structures intervene between
the two vessels :—
1. Styloid process.
2. Stylo-pharyngeus muscle.
3. Glosso-pharyngeal nerve.
\. Pharyngeal branches of vagus
and sympathetic.
;. A portion of the parotid gland.
Posterior to the internal carotid is the longus capitis (O.T.
rectus capitis anticus major) and the sympathetic trunk;
postero-laterally are the glosso-pharyngeal, the vagus, the
accessory and the hypoglossal nerve; and still more laterally
and posteriorly is the internal jugular vein. On its medial
aspect the internal carotid is related to the pharynx, the
ascending pharyngeal artery and the levator veli palatini.
Before leaving this vessel, note that near the base of the
skull four nerves appear in the interval between it and the
internal jugular vein; these are the glosso-pharyngeal, the
vagus, the accessory, and the hypoglossal.
Vena Jugularis Interna.—The internal jugular vein is the
largest venous channel of the neck. It enters the neck through
the postero-lateral compartment of the jugular foramen, where
it is directly continuous with the transverse sinus of the cranial
cavity. From the jugular foramen it proceeds downwards,
until it reaches the posterior aspect of the medial end of
the clavicle, where it joins the subclavian vein to form the
innominate vein. Its commencement in the jugular foramen
shows a slight dilatation, termed the bulb, the lumen of which
remains at all times patent owing to the connection of its
walls to the margins of the foramen. The skull cap should
be removed and a probe should be passed from the trans-
verse sinus into the internal jugular vein, to demonstrate the
continuity of the two channels.
Relations.—At its commencement the internal jugular
vein lies postero-lateral to the upper end of the cervical
part of the internal carotid artery, from which it is partially
separated by the last four cerebral nerves. As it descends
it assumes a more directly lateral relationship, first to the
internal and then to the common carotid, overlapping each
vessel to a slight extent anteriorly; and it is enclosed with them
and the vagus nerve in a common sheath of deep cervical
fascia, the nerve lying in its own compartment of the sheath
between the arteries medially and the vein laterally, and in a
posterior plane.
The superficial or lateral relations of the vein in the upper
part of its extent are the styloid process, with the stylo-
pharyngeus and stylo-hyoid muscles,-and the posterior belly
of the digastric, which separate it from the upper part of the
postero-medial surface of the parotid gland. In this part
of its extent it is crossed superficially, along the upper border
of the posterior belly of the digastric, by the posterior
auricular artery, and at the lower border of the digastric
by the accessory nerve, passing downwards and posteriorly,
and by the occipital artery passing upwards and posteriorly

superficial to the nerve. At a slightly lower level it is con-
cealed by the lower part of the postero-medial surface of the
parotid, and it is crossed by the sterno-mastoid branch of the
occipital artery. After it emerges from under cover of the
parotid, it lies under cover of the anterior border of the
sterno-mastoid, except in the region of the upper part of the
carotid triangle, where it may project anteriorly, beyond the
anterior border of the muscle, for a short distance. It is
separated from the sterno-mastoid by numerous deep cervical
lymph glands; and under cover of the muscle it is crossed
superficially, at the level of the upper part of the thyreoid

cartilage, by the communicans cervicalis from the cervical
plexus, and, at the level of the cricoid cartilage, by the
intermediate tendon of the omo-hyoid, the sterno-mastoid
branch of the superior thyreoid artery and the nerve to the
posterior belly of the omo-hyoid. Below the omo-hyoid it
is covered by the posterior border of the sterno-hyoid, and is
crossed by the anterior jugular vein; and at its termination
it lies posterior to the sternal end of the clavicle.
Posteriorly, it is in relation with the rectus capitis lateralis;
the rectus capitis anterior (O.T. anticus minor) ; and the loop
between the first and second cervical nerves. At a lower
level its posterior relations are the transverse processes of the
cervical vertebrae and the muscles attached to their anterior
tubercles, viz., the longus capitis (O.T. rectus capitis anticus
major) and the scalenus anterior. Between its posterior
surface and the scalenus anterior are the ascending cervical
artery, the phrenic nerve, and, crossing superficial to the latter,
the transverse cervical and the transverse scapular arteries.
On the left side the terminal part of the thoracic duct also
crosses the phrenic nerve posterior to the internal jugular vein.
At the medial border of the scalenus anterior the thyreo-
cervical artery is posterior to it, and at a lower level, the
first part of the subclavian artery and the dome of the pleura.
The right vein is usually the larger of the two; and as
they approach the root of the neck both veins incline slightly
to the right, with the result that, on the right side, the lower
part of the vein is separated from the common carotid artery
by a small triangular interval bounded below by the subclavian
artery, whilst on the left side the vein overlaps the anterior
aspect of the common carotid artery.
Tributaries.—Immediately below its commencement the
internal jugular vein is joined by the inferior petrosal sinus,
and then, successively, by offsets from the pharyngeal plexus,
by the lingual vein, the common facial vein, the superior and
middle thyreoid veins. In some cases it is joined near its
upper end by a vena comes which runs with the occipital
artery; and, occasionally, near its lower end, it receives the
lymph trunks which usually open into the commencement
of the innominate vein.
Dissection.—Slit open the lower part of the vein and examine the valve
which lies close to its extremity. It consists of two or three semilunar
flaps which prevent regurgitation of blood from the innominate vein into
the internal jugular.
Nervi Glosso-pharyngeus, Vagus, Accessorius. — After
the removal of the brain these nerves were seen leaving
the cranial cavity through the middle compartment of the
jugular foramen in the interval between the commencement
of the internal jugular vein postero-laterally and the inferior
petrosal sinus antero-medially (p. 215, and Fig. 125, p. 31 o).
The dissector should again examine the interior of the cranial
cavity and refresh his memory as to the manner in which
they enter the foramen. The glossopharyngeal occupies
the most anterior position, and it is cut off from the others
by a separate tube-like sheath of dura mater. The accessory
is placed posterior to the vagus, and both are included
within the same sheath of dura mater. They therefore

traverse the foramen in close contact with each other.
Reaching the exterior of the skull, the three become
associated with the hypoglossal nerve; and the four nerves
lie for a short distance in the interval between the internal
jugular vein and the internal carotid artery, but soon they
choose different routes. The accessory inclines posteriorly,
superficial or deep to the internal jugular vein; the glosso-
pharyngeal runs anteriorly, superficial to the internal carotid,

a lower level the hypoglossal turns anteriorly across the
external and internal carotid arteries; and the vagus proceeds
vertically downwards, first between the internal jugular vein
and the internal carotid, and then between the vein and the
common carotid (Fig. 100).
In an ordinary dissection it is impossible to follow out many of the
minute twigs which take origin from these nerves in the region of the
basis cranii. To do so it is necessary to possess a perfectly fresh part
which has been specially prepared by having the soft parts toughened with
spirit and the bone softened by immersion in a weak solution of acid.

Even then the dissection is a difficult one, although it should certainly be
undertaken by the advanced student, in the event of his being able to obtain
a part for the purpose.
In the following description of these nerves the account
of the branches which can in all cases be traced is printed in
ordinary type, whilst that of those requiring special dissection
is printed in small type.
Nervus Glosso-pharyngeus.—The glosso-pharyngeal nerve
inclines downwards and anteriorly and crosses the internal
carotid artery superficially. At first it lies medial to the
styloid process and the stylo - pharyngeus muscle, then it
hooks round the lower border of the muscle and curves
anteriorly upon its superficial surface to gain the base of
the tongue. In the dissection of the submaxillary region,
its terminal part was seen disappearing under cover of the
hyoglossus muscle, where it ends in lingual branches.
In the present dissection the following branches should be
made out:—
1. Communicating branch from 3. Pharyngeal.
the facial. 4. Tonsillitic.
2. Nerve to the stylo-pharyngeus. 5. Lingual.
The communicating branch from the facial springs from the nerve to
the posterior belly of the digastric, and, as a rule, emerges from midst the
fibres of that muscle to join the glosso-pharyngeal close to the lower part of
the jugular foramen.
The stylo-pharyngeal nerve is a small twig which enters the
muscle of the same name. The greater part of its fibres,
however, are continued through the muscle to the mucous
membrane of the pharynx.
The pharyngeal branches consist—(1) of one or two small
twigs which perforate the superior constrictor to reach the
mucous membrane of the pharynx; and (2) a larger nerve
which comes off higher up and passes with the pharyngeal
branch of the vagus to the pharyngeal plexus. It frequently
divides into two or more branches.
The tonsillitic branches proceed from the glosso-pharyngeal
near the base of the tongue. They form a plexus over the
tonsil, termed the circulus tonsillaris, and give twigs to the
mucous membrane of the isthmus faucium and the soft
palate.
The terminal or lingual branches will be followed in the
dissection of the tongue.
11—20 c
HEAD AND NECK
There are still other points in connection with the glosso-pharyngeal
nerve which require mention. At the lower part of the jugular foramen
two small ganglia are formed upon its trunk, and from the lower of these
certain minute branches are given off. The upper ganglion is called the
ganglion supcrius; the lower one is termed the gangl1on petrosum.
The superior ganglion is a small ganglionic swelling, which involves
only a portion of the fibres of the nerve trunk. It is placed in the
upper part of the bony groove in which the nerve lies as it proceeds through
the jugular foramen. No branches arise from it.
The petrous ganglion is a larger swelling, which involves the entire
nerve-trunk, and lies at the opening of the jugular foramen, between the
vagus nerve and the inferior petrosal sinus (which intervenes between it
and the anterior border of the foramen). Its length is not more than two
or three lines. Three branches of communication enter or proceed from it.
These connect it with—(I) the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion; (2)
the auricular branch of the vagus; and (3) the jugular ganglion of the
vagus.
In addition to these twigs the tympanic nerve takes origin from the
petrous ganglion.
Tympanic Nerve.—The ultimate destination of this nerve may be
regarded as the otic ganglion, but it takes a very circuitous route to gain
that structure and it gives off branches on the way. It enters a small foramen
on the ridge which separates the jugular fossa from the carotid foramen
on the lower surface of the petrous bone, and it is conducted by a narrow
canal to the tympanic cavity. It crosses the inner wall of this chamber,
grooving the promontory. Having gained the anterior part of the
tympanum, it enters the bone a second time, and runs in a minute canal,
which tunnels the petrous bone below the upper end of the channel in
which is lodged the tensor tympani muscle. In this part of its course the
tympanic nerve is joined by a branch from the ganglion geniculi of the
facial nerve, and, after the junction is effected, it is termed the small super-
ficial petrosal nerve.
The canal in which the small superficial petrosal nerve is lodged opens
into the cranial cavity upon the anterior surface of the petrous bone,
immediately lateral to the hiatus canalis facialis (O.T. Fallopii). Through
this the nerve emerges, and soon leaves the interior of the cranium by
passing downwards in the interval between the great wing of the sphenoid
and the petrous part of the temporal bone, or through the canaliculus
innominatus, or through the foramen ovale. Outside the skull it ends by
joining the otic ganglion.
In the tympanic cavity the tympanic nerve gives branches of supply
—(1) to the mucous membrane of the tympanum; (2) to the lining
membrane of the mastoid cells; and (3) to the mucous membrane of the
auditory tube (Eustachian). It is connected with the sympathetic plexus
on the internal carotid artery by the superior and inferior carotico-tympanic
branches which pierce the substance of the petrous part of the temporal
bone.
Nervus Vagus.—The vagus passes through the middle
compartment of the jugular foramen in company with the
accessory—both being included within the same sheath of
dura mater. In the neck it pursues a vertical course,
lying, at first, between the internal jugular vein and the
internal carotid artery, and afterwards between the same
vein and the common carotid artery, enclosed within the
sheath which envelops the vessels, but on a plane posterior
to them. Its posterior relations, therefore, are similar to
those of the internal and common carotid arteries. At the
root of the neck it enters the thorax, and has different
relations on the two sides. On the right side it crosses
the first part of the subclavian artery; on the left side, after
crossing anterior to the thoracic duct, it proceeds downwards
between the common carotid and left subclavian arteries,
posterior to the left innominate vein. For its thoracic
relations see p. 99.
The vagus, like the glosso-pharyngeal, has two ganglia in
connection with its upper part. These are the ganglion
jugulare and the ganglion nodosum.
Ganglion Jugulare (O. T. Ganglion of Boot). —This is situated within the
jugular foramen. It is a rounded swelling which is connected by com-
municating twigs with several of the nerves in the neighbourhood, and
it gives off two branches of distribution.
Branches of Communication.—(1) With the facial nerve; (2) with the
petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal 5(3) with the accessory ; (4) with
the superior ganglion of the sympathetic.
Branches of Distribution.—(1) Meningeal; (2) Auricular nerve.
The meningeal branch is a minute twig which runs upwards through
the jugular foramen, and, dividing into two branches, is distributed to
the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa.
The auricular nerve (O.T. Arnold's nerve) obtains a filament of com-
munication from the petrous ganglion of the glosso-pharyngeal, and passes
posteriorly upon the lateral surface of the bulb of the internal jugular vein
to enter a minute aperture on the posterior part of the lateral wall of the
jugular fossa. A narrow canal then conducts it through the substance
of the temporal bone, and, on its way, it crosses the canalis facialis a
short distance above the stylo-mastoid foramen. It is thus brought into
close relation with the facial nerve and is connected with it by an
ascending and a descending branch of communication. Finally, it appears
on the surface of the skull, in the interval between the mastoid process and
the external acustic meatus, where it communicates with the posterior
auricular branch of the facial. It supplies the skin on the posterior aspect
of the outer surface of the walls of the meatus, the skin covering the lower
half of the inner surface of the wall of the meatus, and the lower half of
the tympanic membrane.
Ganglion Nodosum. — After emerging from the jugular
foramen, the vagus nerve is joined by the cerebral portion of
the accessory nerve, and swells out into the ganglion nodosum
(O.T. ganglion of trunk).
The ganglion nodosum is an elongated reddish-coloured
swelling of about three-quarters of an inch in length, which
is developed upon the stem of the vagus half an inch
HEAD AND NECK
below the base of the cranium. Strong branches of com-
munication pass between it and the first loop of the
cervical plexus, and the superior cervical ganglion of the
sympathetic. Further, the hypoglossal nerve is generally
closely bound to it by fibrous attachment, in the midst of
which some interchange of nerve filaments takes place.
Branches of Distribution of the Cervical Part of the
Vagus.—The branches which spring from the vagus as it
traverses the neck are the following: (1) pharyngeal;
(2) superior laryngeal; (3) recurrent; (4) cardiac.
Ramus Pharyngeus. — The pharyngeal branch springs
from the upper part of the ganglion nodosum and runs
downwards and anteriorly, superficial to the internal carotid
artery, to end in the pharyngeal plexus. It is frequently
replaced by two branches, of which the upper is the larger.
Nervus Laryngeus Superior.—This, a much larger branch,
arises from the middle of the ganglion nodosum. It passes
downwards and anteriorly, but differs from the preceding
nerve by passing deep to the internal carotid artery. In
this situation it ends by dividing into the internal laryngeal
and external laryngeal nerves; both of these have been
previously seen in the dissection of the anterior triangle
(p. 232).
Before it divides, the superior laryngeal effects communications by
means of fine twigs with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic,
and it also receives one or two filaments from the pharyngeal plexus.
The internal laryngeal nerve runs to the interval between
the hyoid bone and the thyreoid cartilage; there, after
disappearing under cover of the posterior border of the
thyreo - hyoid muscle, it pierces the membrane of the same
name, and enters the pharynx, and then descends to the
larynx.
The external laryngeal nerve is a very slender branch, which
inclines downwards and anteriorly to reach the crico-thyreoid
muscle, in which it ends.
It supplies a few filaments to the inferior constrictor of the pharnyx and a
fine twig to the superior cardiac branch of the sympathetic, whilst it
receives a communicating branch from the superior cervical ganglion of
the sympathetic.
Nervus Becurrens. — The recurrent nerve arises differ-
ently on the two sides. On the right side, after springing
from the vagus as the latter crosses the first part of the
subclavian artery, it hooks round the artery and ascends to
its termination. On the left side, it arises in the thorax,
and hooks round the aortic arch. In the neck each nerve
ascends in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus,
along the medial side of the lateral lobe of the thyreoid
gland, and, passing posterior or anterior to the inferior
thyreoid artery, it disappears as the inferior laryngeal nerve
under cover of the lower border of the inferior constrictor
muscle, and enters the larynx.
Before the recurrent nerve reaches the larynx it gives
off several branches — viz., (1) cardiac branches; (2) twigs
to the trachea and oesophagus; and (3) a few filaments to the
inferior constrictor as it passes under cover of its lower margin.
Cardiac Branches.—Two cardiac branches arise from the
vagus in the neck. On the right side, both of these enter
the thorax by passing posterior to the subclavian artery and
they end in the deep cardiac plexus. On the left side, the upper
nerve joins the deep cardiac plexus, whilst the lower nerve
enters into the formation of the superficial cardiac plexus.
Nervus Accessorius.—This nerve consists of two parts—
a spinal and a cerebral. In the foramen jugulare the cerebral
portion is connected by one or two fine twigs with the jugular
ganglion of the vagus, and below the basis cranii it leaves
the spinal part and joins the vagus.
The cerebral part of the accessory nerve contributes to the vagus
the greater proportion of its motor fibres. They pass over the surface
of the ganglion nodosum, and are continued into the pharyngeal and
into the superior laryngeal nerves. Some of the fibres are carried down
the stem of the vagus into the cardiac branches and also into the recurrent
nerve.
The spinal part of the accessory is directed posteriorly
under the transverse process of the atlas. It crosses the
internal jugular vein, and disappears into the substance
of the sterno-mastoid muscle. Its further course has been
studied already (pp. 147 and 150). It is distributed to two
muscles—viz., the sterno-mastoid and the trapezius.
Plexus Pharyngeus.—This is a mesh-work of fine
nerve filaments, which is formed upon the wall of the
pharynx at the level of the middle constrictor muscle.
The pharyngeal branches of the vagus, glosso-pharyngeal,
and superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic enter into
HEAD AND NECK
its construction, and one or more minute ganglia are
developed in connection with it. Its terminal twigs are given
to the muscles and mucous membrane of the pharynx, and
one branch (the ramus lingualis vagi) connects the plexus
with the hypoglossal nerve.
Nervus Hypoglossus.— The hypoglossal nerve makes its
exit from the cranium through the canalis hypoglossi
(O.T. anterior condyloid foramen). It pierces the dura mater
in two separate parts, which unite into one stem at the exit
of the bony canal. As it issues from the canal it lies deeply,
medial to the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid
artery; immediately afterwards it inclines laterally, and,
taking a half spiral turn around the ganglion nodosum of the
vagus, it appears between the two vessels, and descends between
them to the lower border of the posterior belly of the digastric
muscle, where it passes into the carotid triangle. Its close
connection w1th the ganglion nodosum of the vagus has
been noted already (p. 314). In the carotid triangle it hooks
round the lower end of the occipital artery, below its sterno-
mastoid branch, and, turning anteriorly, it crosses the occipital,
the internal and external carotid arteries and the loop of the
lingual artery superficially. Then it passes on the medial
sides of the posterior belly of the digastric and the stylo-hyoid,
and enters the digastric triangle, where it disappears medial
to the mylo-hyoid, and at the anterior border of the hyoglossus
it enters the base of the tongue.
Branches of Communication.—Near the base of the skull the hypoglossal
is brought into connection with—(1) the superior cervical ganglion; (2) the
vagus; and (3) the first cervical nerve; as it turns round the occipital
artery it receives (4) the ramus l1ngualis vagi from the pharyngeal plexus;
and on the surface of the hyoglossus it communicates with (5) the lingual
nerve (p. 290).
Branches of Distribution.—(1) The meningeal branch arises
in the upper part of the canalis hypoglossi, and, regaining the
interior of the cranium, it is distributed to the dura mater
around the foramen magnum. (2) Vascular twigs are said to
be supplied to the deep aspect of the internal jugular vein.
(3) The descendens hypoglossi, which conveys fibres of the
first cervical nerve to the infra hyoid muscles. (4) The nerve
to the thyreo-hyoid, which also consists of first cervical nerve
fibres. (5) The terminal branches, which supply the genio-
hyoid and all the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue,
except the palato-glossus.
Dissection. —In the dissection of the neck the greater part of the cervical
sympathetic, with the branches which proceed from it, has been displayed.
The inferior ganglion, which lies deeply in the hollow between the
transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first
rib, is still to a certain extent concealed, and must now be displayed.
Dislodge the subclavian artery from its place on the first rib behind the
scalenus anterior muscle, and turn it medially. To do this efficiently,
it will be necessary to cut the costo-cervical artery at its origin. Great care
must be taken to preserve uninjured the fine nerves which proceed down-
wards anterior to the first part of the subclavian artery. If more space for
the dissection is required, the anterior part of the first rib may be removed
by the bone-forceps, but, as a general rule, this will not be necessary.
Truncus Sympathicus in the Neck.—The cervical part of
the sympathetic trunk takes a vertical course through the neck,
anterior to the roots of the transverse processes of the vertebra.
It lies between the internal and common carotid arteries
anteriorly and the longus capitis (O.T. rectus capitis anticus
major) and longus colli muscles posteriorly. Above, it is pro-
longed upwards in the form of a stout, ascending nerve-trunk,
tl1e nervus caroticus internus, which accompanies the internal
carotid artery into the carotid canal; below, it becomes con-
tinuous, over the neck of the first rib and posterior to the
apex of the pleura, with the thoracic portion of the sympa-
thetic. Only three ganglia are developed upon this part of
the trunk and no white rami communicantes from the cervical
nerves enter either the trunk or the ganglia.
Ganglion Cervicale Superius.—This, the largest of the
three ganglia, is an elongated fusiform body which varies
somewhat in size. It is placed upon the upper part of the
longus capitis, opposite the second and third vertebrae, and
posterior to the carotid sheath. From its upper end the stout
nervus caroticus internus passes into the carotid canal, whilst
its lower end tapers into the downward continuation of the
trunk. Numerous branches issue from it; of these some
connect it with neighbouring nerves, whilst others are
distributed in various ways.
The connecting branches are: (1) slender grey rami
communicantes which connect it with the upper four cervical
nerves; (2) twigs to both ganglia of the vagus; (3) to the
petrous ganglion of the glosso - pharyngeal; and (4) to the
hypoglossal. It is not connected with the accessory.
The branches of distribution are: (1) nervus caroticus
internus; (2) nervi carotici externi; (3) rami laryngo-
pharyngei; (4) nervus cardiacus superior.
HEAD AND NECK
Nervus Caroticus Internus.—This branch has been noted
passing from the upper end of the ganglion into the carotid
canal. Its distribution will be considered later.
Nervi Carotid Externi.—Two to six filaments, called
external carotid branches, run to the external carotid artery,
and form a loose interlacement around it and its branches.
From this external carotid plexus a branch is given to the
carotid body, and prolongations are continued on all the
branches of the artery. The part continued upon the external
maxillary artery supplies the sympathetic root to the sub-
maxillary ganglion, whilst the subdivision upon the middle
meningeal artery furnishes the corresponding root to the otic
ganglion, as well as the external superficial petrosal nerve which
runs to the ganglion geniculi of the facial nerve.
Rami Laryngo-pharyngei.—The laryngopharyngeal branches
pass between the two carotid arteries to join the pharyngeal
plexus, and some join the superior laryngeal nerve.
Nervus Cardiacus Superior.—This is a long slender branch
which springs by several roots from the ganglion, and then
proceeds downwards, posterior to the carotid artery. At
different stages of its course it is joined by other branches of
the sympathetic, by a branch from the vagus, and also by
filaments from the external laryngeal and recurrent nerves.
The right superior cardiac nerve is continued into the thorax
by passing posterior or anterior to the subclavian artery, and it
ends in the deep cardiac plexus. The left superior cardiac nerve
follows the left common carotid artery in the thorax, and,
crossing the left side of the arch of the aorta, ends in the
superficial cardiac plexus.
Ganglion Cervicale Medium. — This ganglion is the
smallest of the three ganglia of the neck. It. is placed
opposite the sixth cervical vertebra in close proximity to
the inferior thyreoid artery, upon which it not infrequently
rests. Its branches are: (1) grey rami communicantes, which
pass between the contiguous margins of the scalenus anterior
and longus colli muscles and connect it with the fifth and
sixth cervical nerves; (2) thyreoid branches, which run to the
thyreoid gland, along the inferior thyreoid artery, and form
connections with the external laryngeal and recurrent nerves;
(3) the middle cardiac nerve.
On both sides the middle cardiac nerve enters the thorax
and is lost in the deep cardiac plexus. On the right side
3l9
it passes posterior or anterior to the subclavian artery; on
the left side it is continued downwards between the common
carotid and subclavian arteries.
Ganglion Cervicale Inferius.—The inferior cervical ganglion
is lodged in the interval between the transverse process of the
seventh cervical vertebra and the neck of the first rib. In this
position it lies posterior to the vertebral artery. It is by no
means uncommon to find it more or less completely fused,
over the neck of the first rib, with the first thoracic ganglion.
The connection between it and the middle cervical ganglion is
generally in the form of two or more slender nerve cords, of
which one passes anterior to the subclavian artery. The
latter loops round the subclavian artery and is termed the
ansa subdavia (Vieussenii).
The branches of the inferior cervical ganglion are:—
1. Grey rami communicantes to the seventh and eighth cervical nerves.
2. Rami vasculares.
3. Inferior cardiac nerve.
The rami vasculares are fine branches which form a plexus
around the subclavian artery and its branches. Those
around the vertebral artery are remarkable for their large size.
The nervus cardiacus inferior on both sides enters the deep
cardiac plexus.
After the vessels and nerves of the neck have been studied
the dissectors should examine the thyreoid gland.
Glandula Thyreoidea.—The thyreoid gland is a highly
vascular solid body, which clasps the upper part of the
trachea and extends upwards for some distance upon each
side of the larynx. It varies greatly in size in different in-
dividuals; and in females and children it is always relatively
larger than in adult males. It consists of three well-marked
subdivisions, viz., two lateral lobes joined across the median
plane by the isthmus. Each lateral lobe is somewhat conical
in form; its base lies at the level of the fifth or the sixth
tracheal ring, whilst its apex rests against the side of the
thyreoid cartilage. Its superficial or lateral surface is full and
rounded, and is clothed by the pretracheal layer of cervical
fascia, from which it derives a sheath; and it is covered by the
sterno-thyreoid, sterno-hyoid, and omo-hyoid muscles, and by
the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid (Fig. 127, p. 322).
Its deep or medial surface is adapted to the parts upon which it
HEAD AND NECK
lies, viz., to the side of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage,
and the thyreoid cartilage. Its posterior border is in relation
with the lateral margins of the oesophagus and the lateral
margin of the pharynx, and in many cases it overlaps the
common carotid artery. Its anterior border is connected with

the corresponding border of the opposite lateral lobe by the
isthmus. Above the isthmus it is in relation with the anterior
terminal branch of the superior thyreoid artery, and below the
isthmus with the commencement of the inferior thyreoid vein.
The isthmus of the thyreoid gland has already been seen
in the dissection of the middle line of the neck. It is a
band of varying width which lies anterior to the second, third,
TRACHEA AND (ESOPHAGUS 321
and fourth rings of the trachea, and, therefore, nearer the
lower than the upper ends of the two lateral lobes.
An additional lobe, the pyramidal or middle lobe, is
frequently present. It is an elongated slender process which
springs from the isthmus, on one or other side of the median
plane (more usually on the left side), and extends upwards
towards the hyoid bone. To this it may be connected by
f1brous tissue, or by a narrow slip of muscular f1bres called
the levator glandula thyreoidea. In some cases this little
muscle has an attachment to the thyreoid gland independ-
ently of the pyramidal process. The thyreoid gland is firmly
connected to the parts upon which it lies, and therefore
follows the larynx in all its movements.
The dissector should note the great vascularity of the thyreoid gland.
Four large arteries, and occasionally a fifth smaller vessel, convey blood to
its substance. The two superior thyreo1d branches of the external carotid
arteries divide at the apex of each lateral lobe into three branches for its
supply; the two inferior thyreoid branches, from the thyreo-cervical trunks
of the subclavian arteries, distribute their terminal branches to the basal
portion and deep surface of each lateral lobe. The occasional artery is
the thyreoidea ima, a branch of the innominate or, more rarely, of the
common carotid or the aortic arch. It ascends upon the anterior aspect
of the trachea to reach the isthmus of the thyreoid gland. These thyreoid
arteries anastomose with each other.
The veins which drain the blood away from the thyreoid gland are still
more numerous. They arise in part by tributaries which spring from a
venous network on the anterior face of the structure, but chiefly by branches
which emerge from its substance. They are three in number on each side
—viz. the superior thyreoid, the middle thyreoid, and the inferior thyreoid.
The superior and middle thyreoid veins cross the common carotid artery and
join the internal jugular; the inferior thyreoid vein descends on the trachea.
At the root of the neck it usually joins its fellow of the opposite side to
form a common stem which opens into the left innominate.
Trachea and (Esophagus.—The windpipe and the gullet
in the cervical portion of their course may now be studied.
Both begin at the level of the cricoid cartilage, anterior to
the sixth cervical vertebra. From this point they extend
downwards, anterior to the vertebral column, to the thoracic
cavity.
The trachea, or windpipe, is a wide tube which is kept
constantly patent by the cartilaginous rings embedded in its
walls. These rings do not form complete circles; posteriorly
they are deficient, and, in consequence, the posterior surface
of the trachea is flattened. Above, it is continuous with the
larynx, and, throughout its course in the neck, it is placed in
the median plane of the body. The anterior relations of the
vol. n—21
HEAD AND NECK
trachea have already been fully discussed in connection with
the description of the parts occupying the middle line of the
neck (p. 229). Posteriorly, it rests upon the gullet. Upon
either side is the common carotid artery; whilst closely applied
to it in its upper part is the lateral lobe of the thyreoid
gland. The recurrent nerve ascends, on each side, in the
angle between the trachea and oesophagus.
The (esophagus or gullet is a narrow tube, with thick
muscular walls, which extends from the pharynx to the
stomach. In the cervical part of its course it lies between the
trachea and the longus colli muscles, and as it descends
Trachea

it inclines slightly to the left, so that it comes more closely
into relation with the lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland and
the carotid sheath upon the left side than with the same
structures on the opposite side.
The dissector may terminate his dissection of the neck by
an examination of the scalene muscles, and the rectus capitis
lateralis.
Musculi Scaleni.—These muscles constitute the fleshy mass
which is seen extending from the transverse processes of the
cervical vertebrae to the upper two costal arches. They are
three in number, and are named, from their relative positions,
anterior, medius, and posterior.
Musculus Scalenus Anterior.—This is a well-defined muscle
which is separated from the scalenus medius by the roots of
SCALENE MUSCLES
323
the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery. It arises from
the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third,
fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and, tapering some-
what as it descends, it is inserted into the scalene tubercle
on the inner margin of the first rib, and also into the
superior surface of the same bone between the two subclavian
grooves.
The upper part of its anterior surface is concealed by the
sterno-mastoid and the lower part by the clavicle. The
common carotid artery descends along its medial border.
Between it and the sterno-mastoid lie the internal jugular
vein; the intermediate tendon of the omo-hyoid; the phrenic
nerve, passing downwards and medially; and the transverse
cervical and transverse scapular arteries passing postero-
laterally, superficial to the phrenic nerve. Between it and
the clavicle lies the subclavian vein.
Its posterior surface is in relation, above, with the tips of
the lower cervical transverse processes, and below, with the
apex of the pleura, the second part of the subclavian artery,
and its costo-cervical branch. The lateral border touches the
roots of the brachial plexus, and the medial border is in
relation with the thyreo-cervical artery, its inferior thyreoid
branch, and with the vertebral artery.
Musculus Scalenus Medius.—This is a more powerful
muscle than the preceding. It springs from the posterior
tubercles of all the cervical transverse processes (with the
exception, in some cases, of the first), and it is inserted into
a rough oval impression which marks the upper surface of
the first rib between the tubercle of the rib and the groove
for the subclavian artery.
It forms part of the floor of the posterior triangle of the
neck. Its superficial surface is in relation with the brachial
plexus and the third part of the subclavian artery. Its
posterior border touches the levator scapulae; and the dorsal
scapular nerve and the descending branch of the transverse
cervical artery pass between it and that muscle. The lower
part of its anterior border is in relation with the apex of
the pleura, and the upper two roots of the long thoracic
nerve pierce the substance of the muscle.
Musculus Scalenus Posterior. — The scalenus posterior is
generally inseparable, at its origin, from the scalenus medius.
It is the smallest of the three, and springs by two or three
n—21 a
HEAD AND NECK
slips from the transverse processes of a corresponding number
of the lower cervical vertebrae in common with the scalenus
medius. It is inserted into the upper border of the second
rib, immediately anterior to the insertion of the levator
costae.
The scalene muscles are supplied by twigs from the
anterior branches of the cervical nerves, particularly the lower
four.

Dissection.—The little muscle termed the rectus capitis lateralis should
now be cleaned, and its attachments defined. It lies in the interval
between the transverse process of the atlas and the jugular process of the
occipital bone, posterior to the commencement of the internal jugular
vein. The anterior branch of the first cervical nerve will be seen emerging
from under cover of its medial margin.
LATERAL PART OF MIDDLE CRANIAL FOSSA 325
Rectus Capitis Lateralis.—The rectus lateralis arises from
the anterior part of the upper surface of the extremity of the
transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under
surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone. It is
supplied by a twig from the anterior branch of the first
cervical nerve.
Removal of the Head and Neck from the Trunk.—By the time that
the dissectors of the head and neck have arrived at this stage of their work,
the dissectors of the thorax have in all probability finished their dissection.
If this is the case, the head and neck may be removed from the trunk by
cutting through the vertebral column at the level of the intervertebral fibro-
cartilage between the third and fourth thoracic vertebrae. By this pro-
ceeding the upper three thoracic vertebrae, with the attached portions of the
first, second, and third pairs of ribs, are removed with the neck. The
scalene muscles and the longus colli are. therefore preserved intact.
THE LATERAL PART OF THE MIDDLE
CRANIAL FOSSA.
The structures contained within the middle cranial fossa
may now be examined. In carrying out this dissection, the
head should be supported on a block so that the floor of
the cranial cavity looks upwards. The following are the
structures which must be displayed :—.
1. Cavernous venous sinus.
2. Internal carotid artery.
3. Middle meningeal artery.
4. Accessory meningeal artery.
5. The two roots of the Trigeminal nerve, with the Semilunar
ganglion and the three main divisions of the trigeminal
nerve.
6. Oculo-motor nerve (3rd cerebral).
7. Trochlear nerve (4th cerebral).
8. Abducent nerve (6th cerebral).
9. Internal carotid plexus of the sympathetic.
10. Greater superficial petrosal nerve.
11. Smaller superficial petrosal nerve.
Dissection. —The dura mater has already been removed from one half of
the middle cranial fossa, and on that side it is only necessary to differentiate
the structures which lie in the cavernous sinus; on the other side the dura
mater must be stripped from the medial part of the lateral portion of the
middle cranial fossa. Enter the knife at the anterior clinoid process, and
carry it posteriorly to the apex of the petrous bone. This incision must go
no deeper than is necessary to divide the dura mater, and must be made
immediately to the lateral side of the openings in the membrane through
which the oculo-motor, the trochlear, and trigeminal nerves pass. It is
HEAD AND NECK
very important to preserve these apertures intact, so that the proximal
ends of the nerves may be held in position during the dissection. The
incision through the dura mater may now be carried postero-laterally along
the upper border of the petrous bone in the line of the superior petrosal
sinus, and antero-laterally along the posterior margin of the lesser wing of
the sphenoid. After the incisions are made raise the dura mater with great
care, for it is intimately connected with the nerves which lie subjacent to
it. Thus, where it forms the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, it
is closely applied to the oculo-motor and trochlear nerves, and firmly
attached to the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, whilst over
the petrous bone it is united to the surface of the semilunar ganglion.
The edge of the knife, therefore, must be kept close to the membrane, and
a small portion of the membrane may be left upon the nerves. This can
be removed afterwards as the nerves are defined.
Sinus Cavernosus.—The cavernous sinus has been opened

by the above dissection. It is a short, wide venous channel,
which extends along the side of the body of the sphenoid bone,
from the lower and medial end of the superior orbital fissure
(O.T. sphenoidal fissure) to the apex of the petrous portion
of the temporal bone. Anteriorly, blood is conducted into it
by the ophthalmic veins and the spheno-parietal sinus; whilst
posteriorly the blood is drained away by the superior and
inferior petrosal sinuses. But it has still other connections.
Thus, it receives blood from the lower part of the lateral
surface of the brain by the superficial middle cerebral vein
and some small inferior cerebral veins. It is united with
the corresponding sinus of the opposite side by means of the
anterior and posterior intercavernous sinuses (p. 217). Lastly,
one or more emissary veins leave its lower aspect; one passes
out of the cranium by the foramen ovale, or it may be
through the foramen Vesalii, to the pterygoid venous plexus;
and others accompany the internal carotid artery, through
the foramen lacerum and the carotid canal, and end in the
pharyngeal plexus.
The cavernous sinus is formed in the same manner as
the other venous sinuses. The two layers of the dura mater
are separated from each other, and the interval is lined with
a delicate membrane. A complicated network of interlacing
trabecula? occupies the lumen of the channel, and it is on
this account that the term "cavernous" is applied to it.

This sinus has a special importance on account of its being
traversed by the internal carotid artery; the internal carotid
plexus; the oculo-motor, trochlear, and abducent nerves;
and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The
precise relations which these structures bear to its walls will
be described later; in the meantime it is necessary only
to note that two, viz. the internal carotid artery and the
abducent nerve, lie more distinctly within the interval between
the two layers of the dura mater than the others, but that
they are shut out from the blood channel by the delicate
lining membrane of the sinus. The oculo-motor and trochlear
nerves, and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve,
are closely applied to the lateral wall of the sinus.

Nervus Trigeminus.—The two roots of this nerve have
already been seen piercing the dura mater at the apex of
the petrous portion of the temporal bone under the anterior
margin of the tentorium. Now that the dura mater has been
raised from the lateral part of the middle cranial fossa, the
further relations of these nerve-roots within the cranium may
be studied. It will be noticed that the loosely connected

F1g. 131. —Dissection of the Orbit and the Middle Cranial Fossa. Both
roots of the fifth nerve with the semilunar ganglion are turned laterally.
and parallel funiculi of the portio major, or sensory root, at
once begin to divide and join with each other so as to
form a dense plexiform arrangement, whilst, at the same time,
the nerve-root increases somewhat in breadth. The interlace-
ment, thus brought about, occupies the smooth depression
which marks the anterior aspect of the apex of the petrous
portion of the temporal bone, and it sinks into the semilunar
ganglion (O.T. Gasserian).
The Ganglion Semilunare (O.T. Gasserian) is somewhat
crescentic in form. It lies upon the sutural junction between
the apex of the petrous bone and the great wing of the
sphenoid bone, where it is enclosed within a recess or space,
called the cavum Meckelii, formed by a separation of the two
layers of the dura mater. The concavity of the ganglion is
directed postero-medially, and it is upon this aspect that it
receives the interlacing fibres of the sensory root of the
trigeminal nerve; the convexity of the ganglion is directed
antero-laterally and from it emerge the three main divisions
of the trigeminal nerve. These are—(1) the first, or
ophthalmic division; (2) the second, or maxillary division;
and (3) the third, or mandibular division. The medial •
border of the ganglion is connected with the internal
carotid sympathetic plexus by filaments of communication.
The portio minor or motor root of the fifth nerve should now
be followed. Before the nerve pierces the dura mater the
motor root lies along the medial side of the large sensory root,
but it soon changes its position and comes to lie beneath
the sensory part. To display this relationship, draw the
cut ends of the two roots through the aperture in the dura
mater which leads into the cavum Meckelii, and, gently
dislodging the semilunar ganglion from its place, turn it
antero-laterally so as to expose its deep surface. The small
and firm motor root can readily be recognised lying in a
groove upon the deep surface of the ganglion; and if it is
displaced from this, it will be seen to have no connection with
the ganglion, but to be continued onwards towards the foramen
ovale. It ultimately joins the mandibular division of the
trigeminal nerve. This junction may take place within the
cranium, in the foramen ovale, or immediately outside the
skull.
The three principal divisions of the trigeminal nerve may
next be examined. Begin with the mandibular division,
which is the largest. This proceeds directly downwards, and
almost immediately leaves the cranial cavity through the
foramen ovale.
Whilst isolating this large nerve-trunk and defining the bony aperture
through which it makes its exit, look carefully for the accessory meningeal
artery, which enters the cranium through the same foramen. If the
injection has been forced into this vessel it can easily be detected. An
emissary vein which connects the cavernous sinus with the pterygoid
venous plexus also passes through the foramen ovale.
HEAD AND NECK
The maxillary division is composed entirely of sensory
fibres. It runs anteriorly in relation to the lower and lateral
part of the cavernous sinus, and, after a short course within
the cranium, makes its exit through the foramen rotundum.
Near its origin it gives off a fine meningeal branch to the dura
mater of the middle fossa of the cranium.
The ophthalmic division is the smallest of the three branches
of the trigeminal nerve, and, like the maxillary, it is com-
posed entirely of sensory fibres. It passes anteriorly in the
lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, and ends, close to the
superior orbital fissure, by dividing into three terminal branches.
As it traverses the sinus it is accompanied by the oculo-
motor and trochlear nerves, both of which occupy a higher
level. Like the other two divisions of the trigeminal nerve,
the ophthalmic nerve gives off a meningeal branch. This
small twig passes into the tentorium cerebelli.
The terminal branches of the ophthalmic division of the
trigeminal nerve are the naso-ciliary, the lacrimal, and the
frontal. The naso-ciliary, as a rule, takes origin first; the
lacrimal is given off soon after; and then the stem of the
nerve is continued onwards as the frontal. These three
nerves enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure.
Nervus Oculomotorius (Third), Nervus Trochlearis (Fourth),
and Nervus Abducens (Sixth).—It has been noted already
that the oculo-motor nerve pierces the dura mater within the
small t1iangular area, in the middle cranial fossa, which
lies immediately anterior to the crossing of the attached
and free margins of the tentorium (p. 210). It has been noted
also that the trochlear (fourth) nerve pierces the dura mater
in the posterior fossa under the free margin of the tentorium.
Both now proceed anteriorly in the lateral wall of the cavern-
ous sinus. The oculo-motor nerve occupies the highest
level, then comes the trochlear nerve, and immediately
below that the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.
They therefore present a numerical order from above down-
wards. The abducent nerve, which pierces the dura mater
in the posterior fossa, at the lower and lateral part of the
dorsum sellae, curves round the lateral side of the internal
carotid artery, and then passes anteriorly more directly within
the cavernous sinus than the others (Fig. 130).
The oculo-motor, trochlear, and abducent nerves during
their course in the cavernous sinus receive communica-
tions from the carotid plexus and from the ophthalmic
nerve; and they all enter the orbit by passing through
the superior orbital fissure. Before doing so, the oculo-
motor nerve divides into an upper and a lower division.
As they pass through the superior orbital fissure the various

however, will be studied in the dissection of the orbit.
Arteria Carotis Interna.—The intracranial portion of the
internal carotid artery may now be examined. It lies upon
the lateral aspect of the body of the sphenoid, and, for the
greater part of its course, it traverses the cavernous sinus. It
emerges from the carotid canal into the foramen lacerum
at the apex of the petrous bone; then it passes through the
upper part of the foramen lacerum, pierces the outer layer
HEAD AND NECK
of dura mater, and enters the middle cranial fossa at the root
of the posterior clinoid process; there it bends at right angles,
and passes anteriorly to the lower root of the small wing of
the sphenoid, where it turns abruptly upwards and pierces
the inner layer of the dura mater, immediately posterior to
the entrance of the optic nerve into the optic foramen, and
on the medial side of the anterior clinoid process. It was
severed at this point during the removal of the brain; but it
will be afterwards seen to end on the basal aspect of the
brain, at the commencement of the fissura lateralis (O.T. Sylvian
fissure), by dividing into the anterior and middle cerebral
arteries. Throughout its whole course it is surrounded by
sympathetic filaments, and soon after its entrance into the
cranium the abducent nerve crosses its lateral side.
The intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery gives
off the following branches :—
2. Branches to the semilunar ganglion, J- which arise in the
7. Middle cerebral, / branches. J
8. Choroidal.
Plexus Caroticus Internus.—The sympathetic filaments
which form this plexus can be satisfactorily dissected only in
a subject which has not been injected; and even then, the
dissection is an exceedingly difficult one. The internal carotid
plexus is placed in the cavernous sinus and is chiefly massed
upon the lower and medial aspect of the internal carotid
artery, at the point where it makes its bend upwards. It
supplies filaments to the hypophysis, to the third and fourth
nerves, and to the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve,
and gives the sympathetic root to the ciliary ganglion (O.T.
lenticular ganglion).
Nervus Petrosus Superficialis Major.—This small nerve,
along with a small arterial twig from the middle meningeal
artery, can readily be exposed in the groove on the anterior
face of the petrous bone which leads from the hiatus canalis
facialis to the foramen lacerum. It is placed under the semilunar
ganglion, which must therefore be turned antero-laterally.
In the canalis facialis it joins the ganglion geniculi of the
facial nerve. When traced in the opposite direction, it will

be found to enter the foramen lacerum, where it joins the
nervus petrosus profundus from the carotid plexus. The trunk
formed by the union of these two filaments is the nervus
canalis pterygoidei (O.T. Vidian nerve).
Nervus Petrosus Superficialis Minor appears upon the anterior face
of the petrous bone, through an aperture which is placed immediately
lateral to the hiatus canalis facialis. It leaves the cranial cavity by passing
downwards between the great wing of the sphenoid and the petrous part
of the temporal bone, or through the canaliculus innominatus or through
the foramen ovale, to reach the otic ganglion. This minute nerve, as
has been mentioned already (p. 312), is formed by the union of the
tympanic branch of the glosso-pharyngeal with a branch from the ganglion
geniculi of the facial.
External Superficial Petrosal Nerve.—It is convenient at this stage to
take note of a fourth petrosal nerve—the external superficial petrosal. It
takes origin from the sympathetic plexus which accompanies the middle
meningeal artery, and, entering the petrous bone, is conducted to the
ganglion geniculi of the facial nerve.
Middle and Accessory Meningeal Arteries.—The entrance
of the middle meningeal artery through the foramen spinosum
should now be examined. It gives minute twigs to the
semilunar ganglion, and one—the petrosal artery — which
accompanies the great superficial petrosal nerve into the
hiatus canalis facialis. The further course of the middle
meningeal artery has been described already (pp. 220).
The nervus spinosus of the mandibular nerve also enters
the cranium through the foramen spinosum (p. 275).
The accessory meningeal artery enters the cranium through
the foramen ovale, and is distributed chiefly to the semilunar
ganglion.

Dissection.—The roof of the orbit must be removed with the aid of the
saw, the chisel, and the bone forceps. Begin by removing the thick cranial
wall above the orbital opening, leaving only a thin portion corre-
sponding to the superior orbital arch. Whilst this is being done,
care should be taken to preserve the soft parts of the forehead and the
upper eyelid. It is of great advantage to'retain, throughout the whole
examination of the orbital cavity, the bony ring which constitutes its opening
on the face. The thin roof of the orbit may next be removed with the
chisel and bone forceps. The lesser wing of the sphenoid, where it forms
the upper boundary of the superior orbital fissure, should be taken away
by the bone forceps, but the dissector should carefully preserve intact the
ring of bone around the optic foramen. The superior orbital fissure is
now fully opened up, and the various nerves, as they enter the orbit from
the cavernous sinus, may be followed out. Lastly, the anterior clinoid
process may be taken away with advantage.
Periosteum. — If the dissection has been successfully
carried out, the periosteum clothing the under surface of the
orbital roof will be exposed uninjured. The periosteum of
the orbit forms a funnel-shaped sheath, which encloses all the
contents of the cavity except the zygomatic nerve, and is but
loosely attached to its bony walls. Posteriorly it is directly
continuous, through the superior orbital fissure, with the
dura mater. Expanding with the cavity, it becomes con-
tinuous anteriorly, around the orbital opening, with the
periosteum which clothes the exterior of the skull. Here
also it presents important connections with the palpebral
fascia.
Reflection of the Periosteum and the subsequent Dissection.—The
periosteum should be divided along the middle line of the orbit, and then
transversely close to the orbital opening. It can now be thrown medially
and laterally. When this is done, the lacrimal gland will be exposed in the
antero-lateral part of the cavity. Further, the large frontal nerve, lying
upon the upper surface of the levator palpebne superioris, will be seen in the
middle line of the orbit; as it approaches the anterior part of the cavity
it is joined by the supra-orbital artery. The other superficial structures
are usually more or less obscured by the soft pliable fat, which every-
where fills up the interstices between the different orbital contents. On
carefully separating this, along the medial wall of the orbit, the superior
oblique muscle will be more fully displayed, and lying upon and entering
the posterior part of this muscle the small trochlear or fourth cerebral nerve
will be discovered. The dissector often fails to find this nerve, because as
a general rule he looks for it too far forwards. Lastly, the lacrimal nerve
and artery will be found, running along the lateral wall of the orbit, above
the level of the upper margin of the lateral rectus muscle.
These structures must be thoroughly cleaned and isolated by the removal
of the fat from around them. As the superior oblique muscle is
followed anteriorly it will be found to end in a slender tendon, which
passes through a ring-like pulley attached to the medial angular process of

and the nerves have been everted and turned over to show the motor root.
the frontal bone. This pulley must be denned, and the tendon of the
muscle followed laterally from it to its insertion into the eyeball. Note that
the levator palpebrae superioris lies upon the upper surface of the superior
rectus, and, if it is raised, a nerve twig will be noticed emerging from the
substance of the rectus superior for the supply of the levator palpebrae
muscle. This is a branch of the superior division of the third nerve.
The dissection of the above parts will be facilitated by grasping the
anterior part of the eyeball with the forceps and drawing it forwards. It
may be retained in this position by running a fine needle and thread through
the ocular conjunctiva and stitching it to the nose. In doing this, however,
take care that the needle does not penetrate the cornea, because this might
render the subsequent inflation of the eyeball impossible.
HEAD AND NECK
Nervus Frontalis.—The frontal nerve is the continuation
of the stem of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal
nerve, after it has given off its lacrimal and naso-ciliary
branches. It enters the orbit through the superior orbital
fissure, above the muscles, and runs anteriorly upon the upper
surface of the levator palpebras superioris, immediately sub-
jacent to the periosteal lining of the orbital cavity. It ends
at a variable distance from the orbital opening by dividing
into the supra-orbital and supra-trochlear branches.
The supra-trochlear nerve is the medial and smaller of the
two terminal branches of the frontal. It runs towards the
trochlea of the superior oblique muscle, above which it pierces
the palpebral fascia, leaves the orbit, and turns round the
orbital arch to reach the forehead. Its further course has
been described already (p. 156). In the orbit it gives off
one small twig close to the pulley of the superior oblique
muscle. This passes downwards to join the infra-trochlear
branch of the naso ciliary nerve.
The supra-orbital nerve is continued onwards, in the line
of the parent stem, and, passing through the supra-orbital
notch or foramen, it turns upwards on the forehead (p.
156). In the dissection of the scalp this nerve has been
seen to divide into a lateral and a medial division. Some-
times the separation takes place within the orbit, and in
that case the larger lateral part occupies the supra-orbital
notch.
Nervus Lacrimalis.—This is the smallest of the terminal
branches of the ophthalmic division of the fifth. It enters
the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, above the level
of the muscles, and runs anteriorly, along the lateral wall of
the cavity, above the upper margin of the lateral rectus
muscle. At the anterior part of the orbit it continues its
course, under cover of the lacrimal gland, until it reaches
the lateral part of the upper eyelid, in which it ends (p. 137).
Within the orbital cavity it gives numerous twigs to the deep
surface of the lacrimal gland, and sends downwards a filament
which connects it with the zygomatic branch of the maxillary
nerve.
Nervus Trochlearis.—The small fourth nerve is destined
entirely for the supply of the superior oblique muscle. Having
entered the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, above the
muscles, it passes antero-medially, under the periosteum, and
finally sinks into the upper or orbital surface of the superior
oblique muscle not far from its origin.
GlandulaLacrimalis.—The lacrimal gland is asmall, flattened
and distinctly lobular structure of oval form, which is placed
transversely in the antero-lateral part of the orbit. It con-
sists of two parts or groups of lobules—a superior and an
inferior—imperfectly separated from each other. The glandula
lacrimalis superior, which constitutes the main mass of the gland,
lies in the orbital cavity. Its lateral convex surface is lodged
in a hollow upon the medial aspect of the zygomatic process
of the frontal bone, and it is bound to the lateral part of the
orbital arch by short fibrous bands which proceed from the
periosteum. The deep or medial surface is slightly concave,
and rests upon the levator palpebrae superioris and lateral
rectus, which intervene between it and the eyeball. The
glandula lacrimalis inferior lies below and anterior to the
superior part, from which it is partially separated by the ex-
panded tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris. It projects
into the base of the upper eyelid, and rests upon the con-
junctiva which lines the under aspect of the lid. This portion
of the gland has been already examined in the dissection of
the eyelids (p. 138). Even in the undissected subject it can
be seen through the conjunctiva when the upper eyelid is
fully everted.
The lacrimal gland secretes the tears, and its ducts
(three to five from the superior part and three to nine from
the inferior part) open upon the under surface of the upper
eyelid in the neighbourhood of the fornix (Fig. 64).
Musculus Levator Palpebrae Superioris.—This muscle rests
upon the upper surface of the rectus superior. Posteriorly,
it is narrow and pointed, but it expands as it passes above
the eyeball to reach the upper eyelid. It arises from the under
surface of the roof of the orbit immediately anterior to the
optic foramen, and in the anterior part of the orbital cavity
it widens out into a broad membranous expansion, the con-
nections of which have been described already (p. 136). The
lateral and medial margins of this expansion are fixed to the
rim of the orbital opening, in close proximity to the liga-
mentum palpebrale mediale and the raphe palpebralis lateralis.
By these attachments excessive action of the muscle upon the
upper eyelid is in a measure checked.
Dissection.—Divide the frontal nerve and throw the ends anteriorly and
VOL. 11—22
HEAD AND NECK
posteriorly. The levator palpebrre superioris also may be cut midway
between its origin and insertion. On raising the posterior portion a
minute nerve twig will be seen entering its deep or ocular surface.
This comes from the superior division of the third or oculo-motor nerve.
The eyeball should now be inflated. This may be done from the
front or from behind. If the latter method is selected, gently separate
the fat under cover of the superior rectus muscle, and push the ciliary
vessels and nerves away from the optic nerve. Next make a small incision
through the sheath of the nerve. Pass a ligature round the nerve anterior
to the opening, and then pass a blowpipe, provided with a stylet, through
the incision and along the nerve into the interior of the eyeball. When the
globe of the eye is fully inflated, the ligature may be tightened as the blow-
pipe is withdrawn. A very much better plan, however, is to inflate the
eyeball from the front. For this
purpose make an oblique valvular
aperture in the sclero-corneal junc-
tion, with the point of a sharp
narrow - bladed knife. Through
this the blow-pipe may be intro-
duced, and on its withdrawal after
the inflation of the eyeball the
valvular character of the opening
is sufficient to prevent the escape
of the air.
Posterior to the eyeball the dis-
sector will notice a quantity of
loose bursal-like tissue. This is
the fascia bulbi (O.T. capsule of
Tenon). Seize the upper part of
this with the forceps, and remove
a small portion with a pair of

and the eyeball. In favourable
cases the extent of the fascia can be gauged, and perhaps even the pro-
longations or sheaths which it gives to the tendons of the ocular muscles
may be made out. The description of the fascia bulbi is given on p. 347.
Musculus Rectus Superior.—The rectus superior, which
lies under cover of the levator palpebrse superioris, is now
fully exposed. It arises from the upper margin of the optic
foramen, passes anteriorly above the optic nerve, and ends
upon the upper aspect of the eyeball in a thin, delicate tendon,
which expands somewhat to be inserted into the sclera about
three or four lines posterior to the sclero-corneal junction.
It is supplied by a branch from the superior division of the
oculo-motor nerve.
Musculus Obliquus Superior.—This muscle arises from the
roof of the orbit immediately anterior to the upper and
medial part of the optic foramen. It passes anteriorly, along

the medial wall of the cavity above the medial rectus. At
the anterior part of the orbit it ends in a slender tendon,
which enters the trochlea and at once changes its direction,
proceeding postero-laterally, upon the upper surface of the
eyeball, under cover of the superior rectus. Beyond the
lateral edge of the superior rectus the tendon expands some-
what, and is inserted into the sclera midway between the
entrance of the optic nerve and the cornea.
The trochlea or pulley through which the tendon passes is
a small fibro-cartilaginous ring, which is attached by fibrous
tissue to the trochlear fossa—a depression in the frontal bone
close to the medial angular process. The pulley is lined with
a synovial sheath which facilitates the movement of the
tendon, and from its lateral margin it gives a fibrous invest-
ment to the tendon.
Dissection.—Divide the superior rectus midway between its origin and
its insertion, and reflect the cut ends. On raising the posterior part of
the muscle the superior division of the oculo motor nerve is brought into
view, as it sinks into the deep or ocular surface of the muscle. It
sends a twig to the levator palpebrae superioris. The removal of some
fat will bring the optic nerve more fully into view. At the posterior part of
the orbit three structures will be seen crossing the optic nerve—viz., (1) the
naso-ciliary nerve; (2) the ophthalmic artery; and (3) the superior
ophthalmic vein. These should be carefully cleaned and their branches
followed out. From the naso-ciliary nerve one or two delicate thread-
like branches—the long ciliary nerves—will be found passing along the
optic nerve to reach the eyeball. The short ciliary nerves, much more
numerous, accompany the long ciliary branches, and can readily be dis-
engaged from the fat which surrounds the optic nerve. A strong member
of this group should be selected and followed posteriorly ; it will lead the
dissector to the ciliary ganglion. This is a minute body which is situated
upon the lateral side of the optic nerve in the posterior part of the orbit.
With a little patience and care the roots which the naso-ciliary nerve and
inferior division of the oculo-motor nerve give to this ganglion can be
isolated, and perhaps even the sympathetic root from the internal carotid
plexus will be found.
Nervus Opticus.—The optic nerve enters the orbit through
the optic foramen. It carries with it a strong loose sheath
of dura mater, and also more delicate investments from
the arachnoid and pia mater. The ophthalmic artery, which
accompanies it, lies on its infero-lateral aspect. Within the
orbit the nerve inclines antero - laterally, and at the same
time somewhat downwards, to the back of the eyeball, where
it pierces the sclera a short distance to the medial side of
its centre. The dissector has noted already that the
ophthalmic artery and vein and the naso-ciliary nerve cross
HEAD AND NECK
above the optic nerve, and that it is closely accompanied by
the delicate ciliary nerves and vessels. The optic nerve is
slightly longer than the distance which it has to run from the
optic foramen to the globe of the eye, so that the movements
of the eyeball may not be interfered with. Within the eye-
ball the optic nerve spreads out in the retina.
Nervus Naso-ciliaris.—The naso-ciliary nerve (O.T. nasal)
arises from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal in the
anterior part of the cavernous sinus. It passes through the
superior orbital fissure and enters the orbital cavity, between
the two heads of the lateral rectus muscle and between the
two divisions of the third nerve. It then inclines antero-
medially, and, crossing the optic nerve obliquely, it runs
between the medial rectus and superior oblique muscles to
the medial wall of the orbit, where it divides into two ter-
minal branches — viz., the infra-trochlear and the anterior
ethmoidal nerves. In addition to these it gives off in the
orbit the following branches: (1) long root to the ciliary
ganglion; (2) long ciliary nerves; (3) posterior ethmoidal
nerve.
Radix Longa Ganglii Ciliaris.—This is a very slender
filament which springs from the naso-ciliary as it enters the
orbit between the heads of the lateral rectus. It runs along
the lateral side of the optic nerve, and enters the upper and
posterior part of the ciliary ganglion.
Nervi Ciliares Longi.—The two long ciliary branches
spring from the naso-ciliary as it crosses the optic nerve.
They pass anteriorly, upon the medial side of the optic
nerve, to reach the globe of the eye where they pierce the
sclera. One of the long ciliary nerves very constantly
unites with one of the short ciliary filaments.
Nervus Ethmoidalis Posterior passes through the posterior
ethmoidal foramen to the ethmoidal cells and the sphenoidal
air sinus.
Nervus Infratrochlearis.—The infra-trochlear branch runs
along the medial wall of the orbit below the superior oblique
muscle. After passing under the trochlea of that muscle it
emerges from the orbit and appears upon the face, where it
has been dissected already (p. 128). Near the pulley it
receives a communicating twig from the supra-trochlear nerve.
Nervus Ethmoidalis Anterior.—This is the larger of the
two terminal branches of the naso-ciliary nerve. It leaves
the orbit by the anterior ethmoidal canal, and is conducted to
the interior of the cranium, in which it appears at the lateral
margin of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The canal
in which it runs can readily be opened up with the bone-
forceps to expose the nerve. Upon the cribriform plate it
turns anteriorly, under the dura mater, and almost immedi-
ately disappears, through a slit-like aperture at the side of the
crista galli, into the nasal cavity. There it gives internal
nasal branches to the mucous membrane, and is continued
downwards upon the posterior aspect of the nasal bone.
Finally, it emerges upon the face, as the external nasal nerve,
by passing between the lower margin of the nasal bone and
the lateral cartilage of the nose. Its terminal filaments have
been described already (p. 140).
Ganglion Ciliare (F1g. 138).—The ciliary ganglion is a
small quadrangular body, not much larger than the head
of a large pin. It is placed in the posterior part of the orbit,
between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, and
very commonly on the lateral side of the ophthalmic artery.
At its posterior border it receives its three roots; whilst from
its anterior border the short ciliary nerves are given off.
The sensory root comes from the naso-ciliary, and is called
the long root. The short or motor root is a short, stout trunk;
it comes from the branch of the oculo-motor nerve which
goes to the inferior oblique muscle. The sympathetic root
comes from the internal carotid plexus, it joins the ganglion,
close to the entrance of the long root from the naso-ciliary
nerve. In some cases it joins the long root before it reaches
the ganglion.
Nervi Ciliares Breves.—The short ciliary nerves are from
four to six in number. They come off in two groups, superior
and inferior. The lower nerves are generally more numerous
than the upper. As these fine nerves pass along the optic
nerve they divide and thus increase in number; at the back
of the eyeball from twelve to eighteen may be counted.
Finally they pierce the sclera by a series of apertures which
are placed around the entrance of the optic nerve.
Arteria Ophthalmica.—The ophthalmic artery is a branch
of the internal carotid. It accompanies the optic nerve
into the orbit through the optic foramen. At first it lies
below the optic nerve, but soon winds round its lateral side,
and, crossing above it, passes anteriorly along the medial
It—22 a
HEAD AND NECK
wall of the orbit, below the superior oblique muscle. At the
medial side of the orbit it ends by dividing into two terminal
branches—viz., the frontal and the dorsal nasal (Fig. 136).
The branches of the ophthalmic artery are very numerous,
and they can seldom be satisfactorily displayed, unless a
special injection has been made. They are:—
1. Lacrimal.
2. Muscular.
3. Arteria centralis retinae.
4. Ciliary.
5. Supra-orbital.
6. Ethmoidal.
7. Palpebral.
8. Dorsal nasal.
9. Frontal.
Arteria Lacrimalis.—The lacrimal branch accompanies
the lacrimal nerve, and supplies the gland of that name and

the conjunctiva. In each eyelid an arterial arch, the arcas
tarseus, is formed by the anastomoses of the two lateral
palpebral branches of the lacrimal with the two medial
palpebral branches of the ophthalmic.
Rami Musculares come off at variable points, not only
from the main artery, but also from certain of its branches.
They supply the muscles contained in the orbital cavity.
The Arteria Centralis Retina is a minute but important
artery. It pierces the infero - medial surface of the optic
nerve, about half an inch posterior to the eyeball, and
passes, in its substance, to the interior of the globe of
the eye.
Arteria Ciliares are very numerous. Two groups are
recognised—viz., a posterior and an anterior. The posterior
ciliary arteries run with the ciliary nerves. They arise as
two trunks which spring from the ophthalmic whilst it lies
below the optic nerve. These divide into several slender
branches, which pierce the sclera around the entrance
of the optic nerve. Two members of this group of vessels
enter the eyeball on either side of the optic nerve, somewhat

apart from the others. They are termed arteria ciliares
posteriores longa (Fig. 135). The arteria ciliares anteriores
come off, in the anterior part of the orbit, from the lacrimal
and muscular branches. They vary in number from six to
eight, and run to the anterior part of the eyeball, where they
form an arterial circle under the conjunctiva. Finally, they
pierce the sclera immediately posterior to the cornea.
Arteria Supraorbitalis.—This accompanies the supra-orbital
nerve to the forehead, where it was dissected at a previous
stage (p. 157).
HEAD AND NECK
Arteria Ethmoidales.—There are two ethmoidal branches,
an anterior and a posterior; they pass through the anterior
and posterior ethmoidal foramina on the medial wall of the
orbit. The arteria ethmoidalis posterior supplies the mucous
lining of the posterior ethmoidal cells, and sends twigs to the
upper part of the nose. The arteria ethmoidalis anterior is
a larger branch. It runs in company with the anterior
ethmoidal nerve, and gives off minute twigs at each stage of
its course. Thus in the anterior ethmoidal foramen it gives
branches to the mucous lining of the anterior ethmoidal cells
and the frontal sinus; during its short sojourn in the cranial
cavity it gives off a small arteria meningea anterior; in the
nasal cavity it gives twigs to the mucous membrane. Its
terminal branch appears on the face and supplies the side of
the nose.
Arteria Dorsalis Nasi.— The dorsal artery of the nose is
distributed at the root of the nose, and anastomoses with
the angular branch of the external maxillary artery.
Arteria Frontalis.—This accompanies the supra-trochlear
nerve to the forehead, where it has been dissected already
(P- 157)-
Venae Ophthalmicae.—As a general rule there are two
ophthalmic veins, superior and inferior. The superior
ophthalmic vein is the larger of the two and it accompanies
the artery. It takes origin at the root of the nose, where
it communicates with the angular vein. The inferior
ophthalmic vein lies below the level of the optic nerve, and
it is brought into communication with the pterygoid venous
plexus by an offset which passes through the inferior orbital
fissure. The two ophthalmic veins receive numerous tribu-
taries during their course through the orbit; finally they
pass between the two heads of the lateral rectus muscle, and
through the superior orbital fissure to open into the cavernous
sinus, either separately or by a common trunk.
Musculi Recti Oculi.—The four straight muscles of the
eyeball diverge from the apex of the orbit. They form the
sides of a four-sided or pyramidal space in which are en-
closed the optic nerve and the greater part of the globe of
the eye. The rectus superior, which has been reflected, has
been studied already. The rectus medialis springs from the
medial side of the optic foramen, and the rectus inferior takes
origin from a fibrous band which bounds the medial end of the
superior orbital fissure. The rectus lateralis is distinguished
from the others by arising from a fibrous arch, the extremities
of which are termed its two heads of origin. The lower
head arises in common with the rectus inferior from the
body of the sphenoid, where this bounds the medial end of
the superior orbital fissure; the upper head is attached above
the superior orbital fissure upon the lateral side of the optic
foramen, where its origin becomes continuous with the
superior rectus. Through the archway which intervenes
between the two heads of the lateral rectus pass the two

divisions of the oculo-motor nerve, the naso ciliary nerve, the
abducent nerve, and the ophthalmic veins (Fig. 137).
A better view of these attachments may be obtained by dividing the
optic nerve close to the optic foramen and turning the eyeball anteriorly.
The manner in which the recti muscles are inserted into
the eyeball should next be studied. Each ends in a delicate
membranous tendon, which is inserted into the sclera, about
a quarter of an inch posterior to the sclero-corneal junction.
Nervus Oculomotorius.—The two divisions of this nerve
enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, between
the two heads of the lateral rectus. The superior division has
HEAD AND NECK
been traced to the rectus superior and the levator palpebrae
superioris. The inferior division is larger. It almost im-
mediately divides into three branches for the supply of the
rectus medialis, the rectus inferior, and the obliquus inferior.
The nerves to the two recti enter the ocular surfaces of the
muscles; the nerve to the inferior oblique is prolonged
anteriorly, in the interval between the rectus inferior and
rectus lateralis, and enters the posterior border of the inferior
oblique muscle. Soon after its origin this branch gives the
short motor root to the ciliary ganglion.
Nervus Abducens.—The sixth nerve will be found closely
applied to the ocular surface of the lateral rectus. It enters
the orbit through the narrow interval between the heads of
lateral rectus muscle and it supplies this muscle only.
Arrangement of the Nerves in the Superior Orbital
Fissure.—When the orbit is dissected, and the various nerves
met with in the dissection of the cavernous sinus are traced
into the cavity, the dissector will note that the arrangement of
the nerves in the superior orbital fissure is somewhat different
from that in the sinus.
The lacrimal, frontal, and trochlear nerves enter the orbit
above the muscles on very much the same plane (Fig. 137).
The other nerves enter between the heads of the lateral
rectus. Of these the superior division of the oculo-motor
nerve is the highest, next comes the naso-ciliary nerve, then
the inferior division of the oculo-motor nerve, and the
abducent nerve occupies the lowest level.
Dissection.—The inferior oblique muscle is placed very differently from
the other muscles of the orbit. It is situated below the eyeball, running
below its inferior surface to gain its lateral surface. It must be dissected
from the front. It is necessary, therefore, to restore the eyeball to its
natural place. Next, evert the lower eyelid and remove the conjunctiva
from its deep surface as it is reflected on to the globe of the eye. A little
dissection in the floor of the anterior part of the orbit and the removal of
some fat will reveal the inferior oblique muscle.
Musculus Obliquus Inferior.—This muscle arises from a
small depression on the orbital surface of the maxilla,
immediately lateral to the opening of the naso-lacrimal duct.
It passes laterally, below the inferior rectus muscle, and,
inclining slightly posteriorly, ends in a thin membranous
tendon, which gains insertion into the lateral aspect of the
sclera of the eyeball under cover of the rectus lateralis. The
insertion is not far from that of the superior oblique, but
is placed more posteriorly. It is supplied by the inferior
division of the third nerve.
Fascia Bulbi (O.T. Capsule of Tenon).—The connections
of the fibrous sheath of the eyeball are somewhat com-
plicated, and they cannot be satisfactorily displayed, in every
detail, in an ordinary dissection. The fascia may be studied

from a threefold point of view—(1) in its connection with
the eyeball; (2) in its connections with the muscles inserted
into the globe of the eye; and (3) in its connections with
the walls of the orbit.
The relation which the fascia bulbi bears to the eyeball
is very simple. The membrane is spread over the posterior
five-sixths of the globe—the cornea alone being free from it.
Anteriorly, it lies in relation with the ocular conjunctiva, with
which it is intimately connected, and it ends by blending
HEAD AND NECK
with the conjunctiva close to the margin of the cornea.
Posteriorly, it fuses with the sheath of the optic nerve where
the nerve pierces the sclera. The internal surface of the
membrane (i.e. the surface towards the globe of the eye) is
smooth, and is connected to the eyeball by some soft yielding
and humid areolar tissue, the interval between them con-
stituting, in fact, an extensive lymph space called the spatium
interfasciale. Its external surface is in contact posteriorly
with the orbital fat, to which it is loosely adherent; and it is
firmly attached to the ocular conjunctiva more anteriorly. It
obviously, therefore, forms a membranous socket in which
the eyeball can glide with the greatest freedom.
The tendons of the various ocular muscles are inserted
into the eyeball within this fascia, and they gain its interior
by piercing the membrane opposite the equator of the globe
(Fig. 139). The lips of the openings through which the four
recti muscles pass are prolonged posteriorly upon the muscles,
in the form of sheaths, very much in the same manner that
the infundibuliform fascia is prolonged upon the spermatic
cord from the abdominal inguinal ring. These sheaths
gradually become more and more attenuated, until at last
they blend with the perimysium of the muscular bellies. In
the case of the superior oblique muscle the corresponding
prolongation is related only to its reflected portion; when it
reaches the pulley it ends, by becoming attached to its
margins. The sheath of the inferior oblique may be traced
upon the muscle as far as the floor of the orbit. The medial
or ocular edge of each of the four apertures through which
the recti muscles pass is strengthened by a slip of fibrous
tissue (Lockwood), and as the fascia bulbi is firmly bound to
the bony wall of the orbit at various points these slips act as
pulleys, and protect the globe of the eye from pressure during
contraction of the muscles. The aperture for the superior
oblique is not furnished with such a slip, and it is doubtful
if the opening for the inferior oblique muscle possesses one.
Dissection.—An admirable view.of the relations which the fascia
bulbi presents to the eyeball and the tendons of the ocular muscles can
be obtained by the following dissection :—Divide the lateral commissure of
the eyelid to the margin of the orbital opening. Pull the eyelids widely
apart, so as to expose as much as possible of the anterior face of the
eyeball. Next divide the conjunctiva by a circular incision just beyond
the cornea. At this point the fascia bulbi is so intimately connected
with the conjunctiva that it is divided at the same time. Now raise care-
fully both conjunctiva and fascia bulbi from the surface of the eyeball,
and spread them out round the orbital opening, as is depicted in Fig. 139.
The openings in the fascia bulbi for the tendons of the ocular muscles
and the thickened margins of these apertures are well seen. Note also the
sheaths which are given to the muscles.
Check and Suspensory Ligaments.—The connections of
the fascia bulbi to the walls of the orbital cavity are
somewhat complicated. The suspensory ligament (Lockwood)
plays an important part in this respect. It stretches across
the anterior part of the orbit, after the fashion of a hammock,
and gives support to the eyeball. Its two extremities are

F1g. 139.—Dissection of the Fascia Bulbi from the front.
narrow, and are attached respectively to the zygomatic and
lacrimal bones. Below the eyeball it widens out and blends
with the fascia bulbi. The lateral and medial check ligaments
also constitute bonds of union between the fascia bulbi and
the orbital wall. They are strong bands which pass from
the sheaths around the lateral and medial recti muscles
to obtain attachment to the zygomatic and lacrimal bones
respectively, where they are brought into association with
the extremities of the suspensory ligament. The function
of the check ligaments is to limit the contraction of the
medial and lateral recti muscles, and thus prevent excessive
rotation of the eyeball in a lateral or medial direction.
There is a similar but less direct provision by means of which
the action of the superior and inferior recti muscles is limited.
HEAD AND NECK
The action of the former muscle is checked through an
intimate connection with the levator palpebrae superioris in
the anterior part of the orbit; the action of the inferior rectus
is checked through a connection with the suspensory ligament.
Dissection.—In order that the zygomatic branch of the maxillary
division of the trigeminal nerve may be displayed in its course through the
orbit, the orbital contents must be removed. The nerve will then be
found in the midst of a little soft fat in the angle between the floor and
lateral wall of the orbit.
Nervus Zygomaticus (O.T. Temporo-Malar).—This small
nerve arises, in the infra-temporal fossa, 'from the maxillary
division of the trigeminal nerve. It enters the orbit by
passing through the inferior orbital fissure and almost
immediately divides into two terminal branches — the
zygomatico-temporal and the zygomatico-facial.
Ramus Zygomaticotemporalis. — This branch runs antero-
superiorly upon the lateral wall of the orbit, under cover of the
periosteum, and, after receiving a communicating twig from
the lacrimal nerve, it enters the zygomatico - orbital canal
of the zygomatic bone. This conducts it to the anterior part
of the temporal region, where it has been examined already
(pp. 155 and 156).
Ramus Zygomaticofacialis.—The zygomatico-facial branch
also enters a zygomatico-orbital canal, and is finally con-
ducted to the face by the zygomatico - facial canal which
traverses the zygomatic bone (p. 127).
The following are the structures to be displayed in this
dissection:—
Vertebral artery. |
Dissection.—To separate the anterior part of the head with the pharynx
from the posterior part and the vertebral column a somewhat complicated
dissection is necessary. Place the head upside down, so that the cut margin
of the skull rests upon the table; divide the common carotid artery, the
internal jugular vein, the vagus nerve, and the sympathetic trunk, on
each side, at the level of the neck of the first rib; pull the trachea
and oesophagus, together with the great blood vessels and nerves, away
from the anterior surface of the vertebral column. The separation must

be effected right up to the base of the skull. At this point great caution
must be observed, otherwise the pharyngeal wall or the insertions of the
prevertebral muscles will be damaged. The base of the skull having been
reached, the point of the knife should be carried across the basilar portion
of the occipital bone, between the pharynx and the prevertebral muscles,
to divide the thick investing periosteum.
The basilar portion of the occipital bone must now be divided by means
of a chisel. Still retaining the part upside down, place the skull so that its
floor rests upon the end of a wooden block. Then apply the edge of the
chisel to the under surface of the basilar portion of the occipital bone,
adjust it accurately in the interval between the pharyngeal wall and the
prevertebral muscles, and with a wooden mallet drive it through the base
of the skull, inclining it, at the same time, slightly posteriorly.
The next step in the dissection consists in making two saw-cuts through
the cranial wall. The head having been placed upon its side, the saw
must be applied to the lateral aspect of the skull, half an inch posterior to
the mastoid process, and be carried obliquely antero-medially to reach a
point immediately posterior to the jugular foramen. A similar saw-cut
must be made upon the opposite side of the head.
To complete the dissection the dissector must again have recourse to the
chisel. Placing the preparation so that the floor of the cranium looks
upwards, divide the base of the skull, on each side, in the interval between
the petrous portion of the temporal bone and the basilar portion of the
occipital bone. Anteriorly, this cut should reach the lateral extremity of
the incision already made through the basilar portion; whilst posteriorly,
it should be carried to the medial side of the jugular foramen to reach
the medial end of the saw-cut. When this has been done upon both sides
of the basilar portion, the anterior part of the skull carrying the pharynx and
the great blood-vessels and nerves can be separated from the posterior part of
the skull and cervical portion of the vertebral column. The only large
nerve which will be divided is the hypoglossal, but, as it is cut close to the
basis cranii, and above its connection with the ganglion nodosum of the
vagus, it retains its position.
The pharynx and anterior portion of the skull should now be covered
with a piece of cloth soaked in preservative solution, and the whole
enveloped in an oil-cloth wrapper. It can then be laid aside until the
dissection of the prevertebral region and the ligaments of the cervical
vertebrae and the occiput have been completed.
Returning to the posterior part of the skull and the cervical
portion of the vertebral column, the dissector should proceed
to define the attachments of the muscles which lie anterior
to the transverse processes and the bodies of the vertebrae.
These are three in number on each side, viz.:—
1. The longus colli.
2. The longus capitis (O.T. rectus capitis anticus major).
3. The rectus capitis anterior (O.T. anticus minor).
Musculus Longus Colli.—This is the most powerful of the prevertebral
muscles, and it lies nearest to the median plane. Its connections are some-
what intricate, but when it has been thoroughly cleaned it will be seen to
consist of three portions—viz., upper and lower oblique parts, and an
intermediate vertical part.
The lower oblique division arises from the lateral aspect of the bodies of
HEAD AND NECK
the upper two or three thoracic vertebrae. It extends upwards, and slightly
laterally, and ends in two tendinous slips which are inserted into the anterior
tubercles of the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae.
In the interval between this portion of the longus colli and the scalenus
anterior, the vertebral artery will be seen. The upper oblique part arises by

three tendinous slips from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes
of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae; it tapers somewhat as it
proceeds upwards and medially to obtain a pointed and tendinous insertion
into the anterior tubercle of the atlas. The vertical part of the muscle is
much the largest of the three divisions. It lies along the medial side of the
oblique portions, and is intimately connected with both of them. It arises
in common with the inferior oblique part by two or three slips from the
sides of the bodies of the upper two or three thoracic vertebrae; above
this it derives additional slips of origin from the bodies of the lower two
cervical vertebrae; lastly, its lateral border is reinforced by slips from the
transverse processes of the lower three or four cervical vertebrae. It
stretches vertically upwards, and is inserted upon the medial side of the
upper oblique part of the muscle by three tendinous processes, which
obtain attachment to the bodies of the second, third, and fourth cervical
vertebrae.
Longus Capitis (O.T. Rectus Capitis Anticus Major).—The long capitis
is an elongated muscle which arises by four tendinous slips from the anterior
tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth
cervical vertebrae. It is inserted anterior to the foramen magnum, upon
the under aspect of the basilar portion of the occipital bone. To reach
this insertion the muscle inclines slightly medially as it ascends upon the
anterior aspect of the vertebral column. It is supplied by twigs from the
first loop of the cervical plexus.
Rectus Capitis Anterior (O.T. Anticus Minor).—This is a small muscle.
It is partly concealed by the upper portion of the longus capitis, which
should be detached from its insertion, and turned downwards so as to bring
it fully into view. It arises from the anterior aspect of the lateral mass of
the atlas and, proceeding upwards and medially, is inserted into the under
surface of the basilar portion of the occipital bone postero-lateral to the
longus capitis. It is supplied by a filament from the first loop of the
cervical plexus.
Before proceeding farther, the dissector should again examine the
attachments of the scalene muscles {v. p. 322).
Musculi Intertransversarii.—To obtain a proper display of the inter-
transverse muscles it will be necessary to remove the prevertebral and
scalene muscles. The intertransverse muscles consist of seven pairs of
small fleshy slips on each side, which connect the bifid extremities of the
cervical transverse processes; they are the anterior and posterior inter-
transverse muscles. Each anterior muscle is attached to the anterior
tubercles of two adjacent transverse processes; whilst the posterior extends
between the posterior tubercles. The highest pair of muscular slips lies
between the atlas and the epistropheus; the lowest pair connects the
transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra with the transverse
process of the first thoracic vertebra.
Nervi Cervicales.—The cervical spinal nerves have a
very definite relation to the intertransverse muscles. The
anterior branches of the lower six nerves make their
appearance by passing laterally between the two slips of the.
corresponding muscles. The posterior divisions of the same
nerves turn posteriorly, medial to the posterior muscular
slips.
The upper two cervical nerves emerge from the vertebral
canal differently from the others. They pass posteriorly
over the posterior arch of the atlas and the vertebral arch of
the epistropheus.
Dissection. —The vertebral artery as it traverses the succession of
foramina in the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae should now
be exposed. Remove the intertransverse muscles as well as the muscles
still attached to the transverse process of the atlas—viz., the rectus lateralis,

the inferior oblique, and the superior oblique. The anterior tubercles and
the costal portions of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth,
and sixth cervical vertebrae should then be snipped off with the bone forceps.
Arteria Vertebralis.—This is an artery of great importance,
for, together with its fellow of the opposite side and the basilar
artery, which is formed by their union, it supplies the hind-
brain, the mid-brain, and the posterior parts of the cerebral
hemispheres, and it helps to supply the spinal medulla. It

Artery in the Neck.
commences at the root of the neck, as a branch of the first
part of the subclavian artery, and it runs upwards, through the
transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, to the base of
the skull. It enters the skull through the foramen magnum
and unites in the posterior fossa of the cranium, at the lower
border of the pons, with its fellow of the opposite side to
form the basilar artery. On account of its varying relations
it is divided into four parts. The first part, which extends
from the subclavian artery to the transverse process of the
sixth cervical ve1tebra, has been seen already (p. 251). It lies
between the longus colli medially, the scalenus anterior
laterally, the transverse process of the seventh cervical
vertebra and the inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic
posteriorly, and the vertebral vein and the common carotid
artery anteriorly.
The second part, now exposed, commences where the
artery enters the transverse process of the sixth cervical
vertebra. It passes vertically upwards, through the series
of foramina transversaria, till it reaches the foramen in the
transverse process of the epistropheus. In that it runs
laterally as well as upwards to gain the foramen in the
more laterally placed transverse process of the atlas; and, as
it emerges upon the upper aspect of the atlas, the third
part commences and curves round the lateral and posterior
aspects of the upper articular process of that bone, in a
groove upon the upper surface of the posterior arch. As
soon as it has passed under cover of the lateral margin of the
posterior atlanto-occipital membrane it becomes the fourth
part. The fourth part turns upwards, pierces the dura mater
and passes into the skull through the foramen magnum,
anterior to the uppermost digitation of the ligamentum denti-
culatum; then, turning antero-medially, between the hypo-
glossal nerve above and the first cervical nerve below, it
passes to the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata, and,
as already stated, joins its fellow of the opposite side at the
lower border of the pons.
Relations.—The relations of the first part have already
been sufficiently considered. The second part lies in and
between the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae,
medial to the intertransverse muscles, lateral to the bodies
of the vertebrae, and anterior to the anterior branches of the
cervical nerves as they pass laterally. It is surrounded not
only by the sympathetic nerve plexus derived from the
inferior cervical ganglion, which accompanies all parts of
the artery, but also by a venous plexus which terminates below
in the vertebral vein or veins. The third part of the artery
lies on the posterior arch of the atlas in the anterior boundary
of the sub-occipital triangle. As it turns posteriorly from the
foramen in the transverse process of the atlas the anterior
branch of the first cervical nerve lies to its medial side,
between it and the lateral mass of that bone; and, as it turns
medially, posterior to the upper articular facet, the trunk of
the first cervical nerve lies below it on the posterior arch, and
11—23 a
HEAD AND NECK
the posterior branch enters the triangle from beneath its
lower border. For the relations of the fourth part see above
and p. 443.
Branches.—No branch of importance is given off from
the first part. The second part gives off lateral spinal
(p. 193) and muscular branches. The branches from the
third part are muscular twigs, and branches to anastomose
with twigs from the occipital and the deep cervical arteries.
The fourth part gives off a meningeal branch before it
perforates the dura mater and, afterwards, a series of branches
to the central nervous system (see pp. 443, 444).
Vena Vertebralis.—Only the first part of the vertebral
artery is accompanied by a definite vertebral vein. There
are no accompanying veins with the fourth part of the artery,
but a plexus is formed round the commencement of the
third part, by the union of tributaries from the venous plexus
in the vertebral canal and from the plexus of veins in the
sub-occipital triangle. This plexus accompanies the second
part of the artery through the transverse processes of the
cervical vertebrae; it anastomoses with the venous plexuses in
the vertebral canal; and it terminates below in one or two
vertebral veins; these accompany the first part of the artery
and end in the posterior aspect of the commencement of the
innominate vein.
Dissection. — The muscles must now be completely removed, in order
that the vertebral and cranio-vertebral joints, and the ligaments in con-
nection with the cervical portion of the vertebral column may be examined.
The Jo1nts of the Neck.
The epistropheus, atlas, and occipital bone present a series
of articulations in which the uniting apparatus is very different
from that of the vertebrae below.
Articulations of the Lower Five Cervical Vertebrae.—The
lower five cervical vertebrae are united together very much
upon the same plan as the vertebrae in other regions of the
vertebral column. Both the bodies and the vertebral arches
are connected by distinct articulations and special ligaments.
Three separate joints may be said to exist between the
opposed surfaces of the bodies of two adjacent cervical
vertebrae—viz., a central synchondrosis and two small lateral
diarthrodial joints.
JOINTS OF THE NECK 357
The synchondrosis occupies by far the greatest part of
the interval between the vertebral bodies, and it presents
the usual characters of such an articulation. The opposed
bony surfaces are coated with a thin layer of hyaline or
encrusting cartilage, and are brought into direct union
by an interposed disc of fibro-cartilage. The intervertebral
fibro-cartilages are distinctly deeper anteriorly than posteriorly,
and upon this circumstance the cervical curvature of the
column in great measure depends.
The two diarthrodial joints are placed one on each side
where the disc of fibro-cartilage is absent. They are of small
extent, and are confined entirely to the intervals between the
projecting lateral lips of the upper surface of the body

F1g. 142.—Frontal section through bodies of certain of the
Cervical Vertebrae.
and the bevelled-off lateral margins of the lower surface of
the vertebral body immediately above. The bony surfaces
are coated with encrusting cartilage, and are separated by
a synovial cavity protected by a feeble capsular ligament.
The ligaments which bind the bodies of the lower five
cervical vertebrae together are the direct continuation upwards
of the anterior and the posterior longitudinal ligaments of
the vertebrae. When the medulla spinalis was removed,
the laminae of the vertebrae, below the epistropheus, were
taken away so that very little dissection will be required to
make out the connections of both of these ligaments. The
anterior longitudinal ligament is a strong band placed on the
anterior faces of the vertebral bodies. It is more firmly fixed
to the intervening intervertebral fibro-cartilages than to the
bones. The posterior longitudinal ligament, which lies on
the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies, constitutes the
anterior boundary of the vertebral canal. In the cervical
region it completely covers the bodies and does not present
the denticulated appearance which is so characteristic lower
down. It is attached chiefly to the fibro-cartilages and
the adjacent margins of the bones.
The vertebral arches of the lower five cervical vertebrae are
bound together by (a) the articulations between the articular
processes; (b) ligamenta flava; (c) interspinous ligaments;
and (d) intertransverse ligaments; (e) ligamentum nuchae.
The joints between the opposing articular processes are of
the diarthrodial variety. The surfaces of bone are coated
with cartilage; there is a joint cavity surrounded by a
distinct capsular ligament lined with a stratum synoviale.
This ligament is more laxly arranged in the neck than in
the lower regions of the vertebral column.
The ligamenta fiava may be examined on the laminae which were
removed for the display of the spinal medulla, and which the dissector was
directed to retain. They fill up the gaps between the laminae of the
vertebrae, and can be best seen when the anterior aspect of the specimen
is viewed.
Ligamenta Flava.—These ligaments are composed of yellow
elastic tissue. Each is attached superiorly to the anterior
surface and inferior margin of the lamina of the vertebra
above, whilst inferiorly it is fixed to the posterior surface
and superior margin of the lamina of the vertebra next
below. In this way they form with the laminae a smooth,
even, posterior wall for the vertebral canal. Each ligament
extends from the posterior part of the articular processes to
the median plane, where its free thickened median border is
in contact with its fellow of the opposite side. The median
slit between them, in the space between each pair of
vertebral arches, is filled with some lax connective tissue,
which allows the egress from the vertebral canal of some
small veins. The width of the ligaments in the different
regions of the vertebral column depends upon the size of
the vertebral canal. Therefore they are widest in the neck
and in the lumbar part of the column. The ligamenta flava,
by virtue of their great strength and elasticity, are powerful
agents in maintaining the curvatures of the vertebral column;
they also give valuable aid to the muscles in restoring the
vertebral column to its original position after it has been bent
in a ventral direction.
The interspinous ligaments are most strongly developed in
the lumbar region, where they fill up the intervals between
the adjacent margins of contiguous spinous processes. In
the thoracic region, and more so in the neck, they are very
weak.
The supraspinous ligaments are thickened bands which
connect the summits of the spinous processes. In the neck
they are replaced by the ligamentum nuchae (p. 172).

F1g. 143.—The Ligamenta Flava in the Lumbar Region of the Spine.
The intertransverse ligaments are feebly marked in the
cervical region and extend chiefly between the anterior bars
of the transverse processes.
Articulations of the Epistropheus, Atlas, and Occipital
Bone.—The articulations which exist between these three
bones all belong to the diarthrodial class. Between the atlas
and epistropheus (O.T. axis) there are three such joints—
viz., a pair between the opposed articular processes, and a
third between the anterior face of the dens and the posterior
face of the anterior arch of the atlas. Between the atlas
and occipital bone there is a pair of joints—viz., between
the occipital condyles and the elliptical cavities upon the
upper aspects of the lateral masses of the atlas.

Anterior Longitudinal Ligament (Fig. 144).—This is a
continuation upwards of the common anterior longitudinal
ligament. Below, it is attached to the anterior aspect of
the body of the epistropheus, whilst above, it is fixed to the
anterior arch of the atlas. It is thick and strong in the
middle, but thins off towards the sides.
Ligamenta Flava.—These fill the interval between the
laminae of the epistropheus and the posterior arch of the
atlas, to the contiguous margins of which they are attached.
They are broader and more membranous than the ligamenta
flava at lower levels.
Capsulae Articulares.—These are somewhat lax, and are
attached to the margins of the articular processes.
Membrana Atlanto-Occipitalis Anterior (Fig. 144).—This
membrane extends from the upper border of the anterior arch
of the atlas to the under surface of the basilar portion of the
occipital bone, anterior to the foramen magnum. On each
side of the median plane it is thin and membranous, and
stretches laterally so as to abut against the atlanto-occipital
capsular ligament. In the median plane it is strengthened
by the upper part of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
Membrana Atlanto-Occipitalis Posterior.—This is a thin and
weak membrane which occupies the gap between the posterior
arch of the atlas and the posterior border of the foramen
magnum, to both of which it is attached. It is very firmly
connected with the dura mater, and on each side it reaches
the atlanto-occipital capsular ligament. Each of its lateral
borders forms an arch over the groove, posterior to the upper
articular facet of the atlas, in which the vertebral artery and
the first cervical nerve are lodged. It is not uncommon to
find these fibrous arches ossified.
Atlanto-Occipital Capsular Ligaments.—These connect
the occipital condyles with the lateral masses of the atlas.

F1g. 144.—Median section through the Basilar Portion of Occipital Bone,
the Atlas, and the Epistropheus. (From Luschka, slightly modified.)
Between the membrana tectoria and the transverse ligament a small synovial bursa
may be seen.
They completely surround the joints, and are connected
anteriorly with the anterior atlanto-occipital membrane, and
posteriorly with the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane.
The occipital bone, therefore, around the foramen magnum
is attached by special ligaments to each of the four portions
of the atlas—viz., to the anterior arch, to the two lateral
masses, and to the posterior arch.
Dissection.—The remaining ligaments are placed within the vertebral
canal in connection with its anterior wall. For their proper display it
HEAD AND NECK
is necessary therefore to remove, with the bone forceps, the laminae of the
epistropheus and the posterior arch of the atlas. The squamous part of
the occipital bone also must be taken away by sawing it through, on
each side, immediately posterior to the jugular process and the condyle,
carrying the saw cut into the foramen magnum. The upper part of the
tube of dura mater, which still remains in the vertebral canal, must
next be carefully detached. A broad membranous band stretching upwards
over the posterior aspect of the body and dens of the epistropheus
is displayed. This is the membrana tectoria.
The Membrana Tectoria (O.T. Posterior Occipito-axial
Ligament).—This is a broad ligamentous sheet which is
attached below to the posterior aspect of the body of
the epistropheus, where it is continuous with the posterior
longitudinal ligament of the vertebrae. It extends upwards,
covering the dens and the anterior margin of the foramen
magnum, and is attached above to the superior grooved
surface of the basilar portion of the occipital bone.
Dissection.—Detach this membrane from the epistropheus and throw
it upwards upon the basilar portion of the occipital bone. By this pro-
ceeding the accessory ligaments of the atlanto-epistropheal joints and the
cruciate ligament are brought into view, and very little further dissection
is required to define them.
Accessory Atlanto-epistropheal Ligaments (Fig. r4s).—
These are two strong bands which take origin from the
posterior aspect of the body of the epistropheus close to the
base of the dens. Each band passes upwards and laterally,
and is attached to the medial and posterior part of the
lateral mass of the atlas. To a certain extent they assist the
alar ligaments in limiting the rotary movements of the atlas
upon the epistropheus.
Ligamentum Cruciatum (Fig. 145).—The cruciate ligament
is composed of a transverse and a vertical part. The liga-
mentum transversum atlantis is by far the most important con-
stituent of this apparatus. It is a strong band which stretches
from the tubercle on the medial aspect of the lateral mass of
the atlas on one side to the corresponding tubercle on the
opposite side. With the anterior arch of the atlas it forms
a ring which encloses the dens—the pivot around which the
atlas bearing the head turns. It is separated from the
posterior aspect of the dens by a loose synovial membrane
which extends anteriorly on each side until it almost reaches
the synovial membrane in connection with the median joint
between the dens and the anterior arch of the atlas. Indeed,
363
in some cases a communication exists between the two synovial
cavities.
The vertical part of the cruciate ligament consists of an
upper and a lower limb, which are termed the crura. Both
are attached to the dorsal surface of the transverse ligament.
The crus superius is the longer and flatter of the two, and
extends upwards on the posterior aspect of the dens to be
attached to the upper aspect of the basilar part of the
occipital bone immediately beyond the anterior margin of

F1g. 145.—Dissection showing the posterior aspects of the Ligaments con-
necting the Occipital Bone, the Atlas, and the Epistropheus with each

the foramen magnum. The crus inferius, much shorter,
extends downwards, and is fixed to the posterior aspect of
the body of the epistropheus.
Dissection.—Detach the superior crus from the occipital bone, and
throw it downwards. The apical ligament is thus displayed, and a better
view of the alar ligaments is obtained.
Ligamentum Apicis Dentis.—The apical ligament of the
dens consists of two parts—an anterior and a posterior. The
posterior part is a rounded cord-like ligament which is attached
below to the summit of the dens, and above to the anterior
margin of the foramen magnum. This ligament, inasmuch
HEAD AND NECK
as it is developed around the continuation of the chorda
dorsalis from the dens to the basis cranii, is a structure of
considerable morphological interest. The anterior part of
the apical ligament is a flat and weak band which is
attached above to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum
at the same point as the posterior portion. Below, the two
portions are separated by an interval filled with cellular tissue,
and the anterior part is attached to the dens immediately
above its articular facet for the anterior arch of the atlas.
Ligamenta Alaria (Fig. 145).—These are very powerful
bands which spring, one from each side of the summit of
the dens. They pass laterally and slightly upwards to be
attached to the medial aspect of the condyloid eminences of
the occipital bone. They limit rotation of the head, and
in this they are aided by the accessory atlanto-epistropheal
ligaments.
Movements.—Nodding movements of the head are permitted at the
atlantooccipital articulations. Rotatory movements of the head and atlas
around the dens, which acts as a pivot, take place at the atlanto-
epistropheal joints. Excessive rotation is checked by the alar ligaments.
MOUTH AND PHARYNX.
The dissectors must now return to the anterior part of the
skull, which had been laid aside while the dissection of the
prevertebral region was being carried on. The mouth and
pharynx should engage their attention in the first instance.
Mouth.—The mouth is the expanded upper part of the
alimentary canal which is placed in the lower part of the
face, below the nasal chambers. Its cavity is controlled by
muscles which are under the influence of the will, and it
is separable into two parts: a smaller external part, termed
the vestibule, which is bounded externally by the lips and
cheeks, and internally by the teeth and gums; and a large
part, the mouth proper, which is placed within the teeth.
The mucous lining of the mouth should be thoroughly cleansed, and
the two subdivisions of the cavity examined through the oral fissure.
Vestibulum Oris.—The vestibule of the mouth, which
passes round the teeth and gums, is a mere fissure-like space,
except when the cheeks are inflated with air. It is into this
part of the mouth that the parotid ducts open (p. 261).
MOUTH
Above and below, it is bounded by the reflection of the
mucous membrane from the lips and cheeks on to the
alveolar margins of the maxilla and mandible. Anteriorly,
it opens upon the face by means of the oral fissure; whilst
posteriorly, it communicates, on each side, with the cavity
of the mouth proper through the interval between the last
molar tooth and the anterior border of the ramus of the
mandible. The existence of this communication is of import-
ance in cases of spasmodic closure of the jaws when all the
teeth are in place, because through it fluids may be introduced
into the posterior part of the mouth proper.
In paralysis of the facial muscles the lips and cheeks fall away from the
dental arches and food is apt to lodge in the vestibule.
Cavum Oris Proprium.—The mouth proper is bounded
anteriorly and laterally by the gums and teeth, whilst posteriorly
it communicates by means of the isthmus faucium with the
pharynx. The floor is formed by the tongue and the mucous
membrane which connects it with the inner aspect of the
mandible; the roof is vaulted, and is formed by the hard
and the soft palates. Into this part of the buccal cavity the
ducts of the submaxillary glands and the ducts of the sub-
lingual glands open (p. 288). When the mouth is closed
the dorsum of the tongue is usually applied more or less
closely to the palate and the cavity is almost completely
obliterated.
The various parts which bound the oral cavity may now
be examined in turn.
Labia Oris.—The structure of the lips has in a great
measure been examined already in the dissection of the face
(P- I33)- Each lip is composed of four layers: (1) Cuta-
neous; (2) muscular; (3) glandular; and (4) mucous. The
skin and mucous membrane become continuous with each
other at the free margin of the lip. From the inner aspect
of the upper lip the mucous membrane is reflected to the
alveolar margin of the maxilla and from the inner aspect of the
lower lip to the mandible. In each case it is raised in the
median plane in the form of a free fold termed the frenulum.
The muscular layer constitutes the chief bulk of the lips. It
is formed by the orbicularis oris and the various muscles
which converge upon the oral fissure. Numerous labial
glands lie in the submucous tissue which intervenes between
HEAD AND NECK
the mucous membrane and the muscular fibres. The ducts
of these glands pierce the mucous membrane and open into
the vestibule. In each lip there is an arterial arch formed
by the corresponding labial arteries (p. 130).
The lymph vessels of both lips join the submaxillary,
lymph glands, but some of the lymph vessels of the upper
lip pass to the superficial parotid glands.
Buccae.—Six layers enter into the construction of the
cheeks, all of which have been examined in the dissection

of the face. (1) Skin; (2) a fatty layer traversed by some of
the facial muscles and the external maxillary artery; (3)
the bucco-pharyngeal aponeurosis; (4) the buccinator muscle;
(5) numerous buccal glands, similar in character to the labial
glands, lie in the submucous tissue between the mucous mem-
brane and the buccinator muscle; (6) the mucous membrane.
Four or five mucous glands of larger size, termed the molar
glands, occupy a more superficial position. They lie either
external or internal to the bucco pharyngeal aponeurosis, close
to the point where this is pierced by the parotid duct, and
their ducts open into the vestibule of the mouth. The
bucco-pharyngeal aponeurosis is a dense fascia which covers the
buccinator muscle. Above and below, it is attached to
367
the alveolar portions of the maxilla and mandible, whilst
posteriorly it is continued over the pharynx. The muscles
which traverse the fatty layer are chiefly the zygomaticus,
the risorius, and the posterior fibres of the platysma. The
parotid duct pierces the inner three layers of the cheek, and
opens into the vestibule of the mouth opposite the second
molar tooth of the maxilla.
Gingivae et Dentes.—The mucous membrane of the gums
is smooth, vascular, and firmly bound down to the subjacent

F1g. 147.—Isthmus of the Fauces as seen through the widely opened Mouth.
The tonsils in the subject from which this drawing was made were

periosteum of the alveolar portions of the jaws by a stratum
of dense connective tissue. It is continuous on the one
hand with the mucous membrane of the lips and cheeks,
and on the other with the mucous membrane of the mouth
proper. The gums closely embrace the necks of the teeth.
In the adult the teeth in each jaw number sixteen. From
the median line posteriorly, on each side, they are the two
incisors, the canine, the two praemolars, the three molars.
Floor of the Mouth.—-The mucous membrane is reflected
from the inner aspect of the mandible to the side of the
tongue, but in the anterior part of the mouth the tongue lies
HEAD AND NECK
more or less free in the buccal cavity, and there the mucous
membrane stretches across the floor from one side of the
mandible to the other. On each side in this region the
projection formed by the sublingual gland, the plica sublingualis,
can be distinguished. Further, if the tongue is pulled
upwards, a median fold of mucous membrane will be seen to
connect its under surface to the floor. This is the frenulum
lingua. At the sides of the frenulum the dissector must
look for the openings of the submaxillary ducts. Each
terminates on a papilla placed close to the side of the
frenulum. More posteriorly, between the side of the tongue
and the mandible and on the summit of the plica sub-
lingualis, are the openings of the sublingual ducts.
Koof of the Mouth.—The hard and the soft palates form
the continuous concave and vaulted roof of the mouth (Fig.
149). Projecting from the middle of the posterior free margin
of the soft palate, and resting upon the dorsum of the tongue,
the uvula will be seen (Fig. 147). Running along the median
line of both the hard and the soft palates is a raphe
which terminates anteriorly, opposite the incisive foramen,
in a slight elevation or papilla termed the incisive papilla.
In the anterior part of the hard palate the mucous membrane,
on each side of the raphe, is thrown into three or four
transverse hard corrugations or ridges; more posteriorly it is
comparatively smooth. By carefully palpating the postero-
lateral angles of the palate the dissector will be able to feel
the hamuli of the medial pterygoid laminse.
Isthmus Faucium.—This name is given to the communi-
cation between the mouth proper and the pharynx (Fig. 147).
To obtain a good view of it the mouth must be well opened
and the tongue depressed. The isthmus faucium and the
parts which bound it can be examined best in the living
subject (Fig. 147). It is bounded above by the soft palate,
below by the dorsum of the tongue, and on each side by two
curved folds of mucous membrane, termed respectively the
arcus glossopalatinus (O.T. anterior pillars of the fauces) and
the arcus pharyngopalatinus (O.T. posterior pillars of the
fauces).
The arcus palatini spring from the base of the uvula, and
arch laterally and then downwards. The arcus glossopalatinus
inclines anteriorly as it descends; it ends upon the side of
the posterior part of the tongue, and it encloses the glosso-
PHARYNX
369
palatums muscle. The arcus pharyngopalatinus, more strongly
marked, inclines posteriorly, and is lost upon the side of the
pharynx; it encloses the pharyngo-palatinus muscle.
In the triangular interval which is formed by the divergence
of these two folds lies the tonsil.
Strictly speaking, the term isthmus faucium should be confined to the
interval between the two glosso-palatine arches, as the tonsil and the
pharyngo-palatine arches belong to the lateral wall of the pharynx.
Pharynx.—The pharynx is a wide musculo-aponeurotic
canal, about 5 inches lons^ which extends from the base of
the cranium to the level of the body of the sixth cervical
vertebra./' There, at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage,
it becomes continuous with the oesophagus. Placed posterior
to the nasal cavities, the mouth and the larynx, it serves as
the passage which conducts air to and from the larynx, as well
as the food from the mouth to the oesophagus.
Under ordinary conditions it is expanded from side to
side and compressed antero-posteriorly, so that it possesses
anterior and posterior walls and two lateral borders. Above the
level of the orifice of the larynx there is always sufficient
space for the passage of air to the lungs, but below the
orifice of the larynx the anterior and posterior walls are in
contact, except when separated by the passage of food.
It is widest above, at the base of the cranium, posterior
to the orifices of the auditory tubes (O.T. Eustachian).
Thence it narrows to the level of the hyoid bone. It widens
again at the level of the upper part of the larynx and then
rapidly narrows to its termination.
To obtain a proper idea of the connections of the pharynx, the dissector
should distend its walls moderately by stuffing it with tow. This may be
introduced either from above, through the mouth, or from below, through
the oesophagus.
The pharynx will now present a somewhat ovoid form.
Posteriorly, its wall is complete, and, when in position, it lies
anterior to the upper six cervical vertebrse, the prevertebral
muscles, and the prevertebral fascia. To these it is bound
by some lax connective tissue which offers no impediment to
the movements of the canal during the process of degluti-
tion. Laterally, the pharynx is related to the great vessels
and nerves of the neck, as well as to the styloid process and
the muscles which take origin from it. Upon this aspect of
vol. 11—24
HEAD AND NECK
the pharynx also is placed the pharyngeal plexus ol nerves,
which supplies its walls with motor and sensory twigs. An-
teriorly, the pharyngeal wall is interrupted by the openings of
the nasal cavities, mouth, and larynx; and it is from the
structures which lie in proximity to these apertures that it
derives its principal attachments. Thus from above down-
wards it is attached on each side—(a) to the medial pterygoid
lamina; (b) to the pterygo-mandibular raphe; (c) to the side
of the tongue; (d) to the inner aspect of the mandible; (e)
to the hyoid bone; (/) to the thyreoid cartilage; (g) to the
cricoid cartilage. Above, it is attached to the basis cranii.
These various attachments will be studied more fully when
the constituent parts of its walls are dissected.
It should be noted that an altogether false idea of the natural form of
the pharynx is obtained when it is examined in its present stuffed condition,
and removed from the vertebral column. When seen in transverse sections
of the frozen body it will be noted that, with the exception of its upper or
nasal part, which remains patent under all conditions, the anterior wall is
more or less nearly approximated to the posterior wall, and below the
opening of the larynx it presents the appearance of a simple transverse
slit.
Pharyngeal Wall.—The wall of the pharynx consists of
four well-marked strata. These are from without inwards:
(1) bucco-pharyngeal fascia; (2) pharyngeal muscles; (3)
pharyngeal aponeurosis; (4) mucous membrane. The
muscular layer, which is composed of the three constrictor
muscles, with the stylo-pharyngeus and pharyngo-palatinus
on each side, must now be dissected.
For this purpose place the preparation so that the chin rests upon a
block and the pharynx hangs downwards with its posterior surface
towards the dissector. The constrictor muscles should now be carefully
cleaned, in the direction of the muscular fibres, by removing the bucco-
pharyngeal fascia, which covers them.
Bucco-pharyngeal Fascia.—This is a coating of fibrous
tissue which ensheaths both the buccinator and the pharyn-
geal muscles.
Vena Pharyngeae.—Upon the posterior wall and lateral
borders of the pharynx the dissector should notice numerous
veins joined together in a plexiform manner. These con-
stitute the pharyngeal venous plexus, which collects blood
from the pharynx, soft palate, and prevertebral region. It
communicates with the pterygoid plexus and the cavernous
sinus. Two or more channels lead the blood from it to the
371
internal jugular vein. This venous plexus, together with the
pharyngeal plexus of nerves, will require to be removed in
order to display the muscles properly.
Constrictor Muscles.—The constrictor muscles are three
curved sheets of muscular fibres which are so arranged that
they overlap each other from below upwards; thus, the

F1g. 148.—Profile view of the Pharynx to show the Constrictor
Muscles. (From Turner.)
inferior constrictor overlaps the lower part of the middle
constrictor, whilst the middle constrictor, in turn, overlaps the
lower part of the superior constrictor. The three muscles are
inserted, in the median plane, into the median raphe which
descends from the basilar portion of the occipital bone along
the posterior aspect of the pharynx.
Musculus Constrictor Pharyngis Inferior (Fig. 148, /).—
HEAD AND NECK
The inferior constrictor muscle is relatively short anteriorly
at its origin, and relatively long posteriorly, where it blends with
the fellow of the opposite side in the median raphe of the
posterior wall of the pharynx. It arises from the posterior
part of the side of the cricoid cartilage, and from the
inferior cornu, the oblique line, and the upper border of
the thyreoid cartilage. The muscle curves posteriorly and
medially around the pharyngeal wall to meet its fellow of
the opposite side in the median raphe. The lower fibres take
a horizontal direction, but the remainder ascend, with increas-
ing degrees of obliquity, until the highest fibres reach the raphe
at a point a short distance below the basis cranii. The lower
margin of the inferior constrictor overlaps the commencement
of the oesophagus, and the inferior laryngeal nerve and the
laryngeal branch of the inferior thyreoid artery pass upwards,
under cover of it, to reach the larynx.
Musculus Constrictor Pharyngis Medius.—This is a fan-
shaped muscle (Fig. 148, e). It arises from the great and
small cornua of the hyoid bone and from the lower part of
the stylo-hyoid ligament. From this origin its fibres pass
round the pharyngeal wall, to be inserted with the corre-
sponding fibres of the opposite side into the median raphe.
As they pass postero- medially, the lowest fibres descend,
the highest ascend, and the intermediate fibres run horizontally.
The lower portion of this muscle is overlapped by the
inferior constrictor, and in the interval which separates the
margins of the muscles anteriorly, opposite the thyreo-hyoid
interval, the internal laryngeal nerve and the laryngeal branch
of the superior thyreoid artery will be seen piercing the
thyreo-hyoid membrane to gain the interior of the pharynx.
Dissection.—The superior constrictor possesses a somewhat complicated
origin, and to bring this fully into view it will be necessary to cut through
the internal pterygoid muscle about its middle, if this has not already been
done (p. 293), and turn the upper and lower portions aside.
Musculus Constrictor Pharyngis Superior (Fig. 148, d).—
The superior constrictor has a weak but continuous line
of origin from the following parts: (a) the lower third of
the posterior border of the medial pterygoid lamina and its
hamulus; (b) the pterygo-mandibular raphe, which is common
to it and the buccinator muscle; (c) the posterior end of the
mylo hyoid ridge on the inner aspect of the mandible; (d) the
mucous membrane of the mouth and side of the tongue.
373
From this somewhat extensive origin, the fibres curve postero-
medially to reach the median raphe, whilst, as a rule, some
of the highest gain a distinct insertion into the pharyngeal
tubercle on the under surface of the basi-occipital bone.
The lower part of the superior constrictor is overlapped
by the middle constrictor, and the stylo-pharyngeus passes into
the interval between the two as it descends to its insertion
(Fig. 148, n). The upper border of the muscle, which is
free and crescentic, falls short of the basis cranii.
Raphe Pterygo-mandibularis (Fig. 148, q).—This is a
strong, narrow, tendinous band, which extends from the
hamulus of the medial pterygoid lamina to the posterior
part of the mylo-hyoid ridge of the mandible. It acts as
a tendinous bond of union between the buccinator and
superior constrictor muscles, and its connections can be
appreciated best by introducing the finger into the mouth
and pressing laterally along the course of the raphe.
Sinus of Morgagni.—This name is applied to the semi-
lunar space which intervenes between the upper crescentic
margin of the superior constrictor and the basis cranii.
The deficiency in the muscular wall of the pharynx in this
region is compensated for by the increased strength of the
pharyngeal aponeurosis, which, in this situation, is called the
pharyngo-basilar fascia. In contact with the outer surface of
the aponeurosis are two muscles belonging to the soft palate
—viz. the levator velipalatini and the tensor velipalatini (Fig.
148, c and b). The levator, which is rounded and fleshy, lies
posterior to the tensor, which is flat and more tendinous.
The tensor can readily be recognised from its position in
relation to the deep surface of the internal pterygoid muscle
and from its tendon turning medially under the hamulus of
the medial pterygoid lamina. In the upper part of the space,
close to the basis cranii and between the origin of the two
muscles, will be seen the auditory tube (O.T. Eustachian tube).
Pharyngeal Aponeurosis.—The upper part of the pharyn-
geal aponeurosis, the pharyngo-basilar fascia, is strong, and it
maintains the integrity of the wall of the pharynx where the
muscular fibres are absent. As it is traced downwards it
gradually becomes weaker, until it is ultimately lost as a
distinct layer. It lies between the muscles and mucous mem-
brane and comes to the surface only where the muscles are
absent. It is the principal means by which the pharynx is
11—24 a
HEAD AND NECK
attached to the base of the skull, and it is united also to the
auditory tubes and the bony margins of the choana.
Dissection.—The pharynx should now be opened by a vertical median
incision through the entire length of its posterior wall. At the upper

extremity of this cut, the knife should be carried transversely, close to the
basis cranii. The stuffing should be removed and the mucous surface of
the pharynx cleansed.
Interior of the Pharynx.—The mucous membrane is now
exposed, and it should be noted that it is continuous,
375
through the various apertures which open into the pharynx,
with the mucous membrane of the nasal cavities, the auditory
tubes and tympanic cavities, the mouth proper, the larynx, and
the oesophagus.
Racemose glands, which lie immediately subjacent to the
mucous membrane and secrete mucus, are present in great
numbers. There are also numerous lymph follicles, and
in certain localities these are aggregated together into large
masses (the tonsils and the pharyngeal tonsil). These will
be studied with the regions of the pharynx in which they
are placed.
The soft palate projects into the pharynx, posterior to
the isthmus faucium, and divides the cavity of the pharynx
into an upper and a lower part. The upper part, called
the naso - pharynx, communicates with the nasal cavities
and the tympanic cavities by four apertures, viz. the two
choanae (O.T. posterior nares) and the two auditory tubes
(O.T. Eustachian tubes).
The lower portion of the pharynx may be regarded as
consisting of an oral part, which lies posterior to the
mouth and tongue, and a laryngeal part, placed posterior
to the larynx. Below the soft palate there are three
openings into the pharynx, viz. the opening of the mouth or
isthmus faucium, the opening of the larynx, and the opening of
the oesophagus.
Pars Nasalis.—The naso-pharynx is situated immediately
posterior to the nasal cavities and below the body of the
sphenoid and the basilar part of the occipital bone. It is the
widest part of the pharynx. Its walls, except the soft palate,
are not capable of movement, and, consequently, its cavity
always remains patent, and presents under all conditions very
much the same form.
In its anterior boundary are the choanae, through which it
opens into the nasal cavities. The choana are two oblong
orifices which slope from the base of the cranium downwards
and anteriorly to the posterior border of the hard palate.
Each is an inch long and half an inch wide, and it is separated
from its fellow by the posterior part of the septum nasi, which
in this region is formed by the vomer. By looking through
the choanae a partial view of the lower two meatuses of the
nose and of the posterior ends of the middle and inferior
conchae may be obtained.
II—24 b
HEAD AND NECK
On the lateral wall of the naso-pharynx, on each side, is
seen the orifice of the auditory tube, and posterior to it the
pharyngeal recess. The ostium pharyngeum of the auditory
tube lies immediately posterior to the lower part of the
corresponding choana, at a level which corresponds closely
with the posterior end of the inferior concha. It is bounded
above and posteriorly by a prominent and rounded margin
termed the torus tubarius, which is altogether deficient below
and anteriorly. A fold of mucous membrane, termed the
salpingopharyngeal fold, descends upon the lateral wall of the
pharynx from the posterior lip of the orifice of the auditory
tube. As this is traced downwards it gradually disappears.
The dissector should pass a Eustachian catheter through the nose into
the auditory tube. Hold the catheter with the point downwards. Pass it
posteriorly through the right nasal cavity, along the septum of the nose, to
the posterior wall of the pharynx. Pull it towards the palate till the bent end
of the catheter catches against the back of the hard palate. Turn the point
through a quarter of a circle to the right side of the head and it will enter
the right auditory tube. If it is desired to catheterise the left auditory tube
pass the catheter through the left nasal cavity, and in the final stage turn the
point to the left side.
In the natural condition of parts there is a deep recess
on the lateral wall of the naso-pharynx immediately posterior
to the prominent posterior lip of the orifice of the auditory
tube. This is termed the lateral recess of the pharynx.
The roof and posterior wall of the naso-pharynx are not
marked off from each other. They form together a continuous
curved surface. The upper portion of this surface looks
downwards and may be regarded as the roof; the lower portion,
which looks anteriorly, constitutes the posterior wall. The roof
is formed by the basilar part of the occipital bone, and
also by a small part of the under surface of the basi-sphenoid,
covered with a dense periosteum and a thick coating of mucous
membrane. The posterior wall is supported posteriorly by
the anterior arch of the atlas and the anterior surface of the
epistropheus. In that part of the roof which lies between the
two lateral recesses of the naso-pharynx there is a marked
collection of lymphoid tissue, the pharyngeal tonsil. Over its
surface the mucous membrane is thickened and wrinkled, and
in its lower part a small median pit, termed the pharyngeal
bursa, may usually be found; it is just large enough to admit
the point of a fine probe.
The floor of the naso-pharynx is formed by the curved,
377
sloping upper surface of the soft palate. Between the posterior
border of the soft palate and the posterior wall of the pharynx
there is an interval, termed the pharyngeal isthmus, through
which the naso-pharynx communicates with the oral pharynx.
It is important to note that the posterior wall and roof of the naso-
pharynx can be explored by the finger introduced through the mouth and
the pharyngeal isthmus.

introduced through the mouth, a view of the four orifices which open into
this part of the pharynx may be obtained. Owing to the mirror being
placed obliquely, and below the level of the hard palate, only the posterior
parts of the inferior conchae are visible through the choanae, and the inferior
meatuses of the nose are altogether out of sight. The middle and superior
meatuses of the nose and the middle and superior conchae, however, can
be brought into view and their condition ascertained. The lateral walls
of the naso-pharynx and the orifices of the auditory tubes can also be fully
inspected.
Pars Oralis.—The oral pharynx lies posterior to the mouth
and tongue. The pharyngeal part of the tongue, which looks
HEAD AND NECK
more or less directly posteriorly, forms its anterior wall in its
lower part. Above this is the isthmus of the fauces, or
the opening into the mouth, limited on either side by the
glosso-palatine arch. These arches may be regarded, there-
fore, as the lateral boundary lines between the mouth and the
pharynx. On the lateral wall of the oral pharynx the pharyngo-
palatine arch forms a prominent fold which is gradually lost
as it is traced downwards. Within this fold is the pharyngo-
palatine muscle. This is an important relation, because the
posterior palatine arches form the lateral boundaries of
the pharyngeal isthmus, and by the contraction of the
pharyngo-palatine muscles the two posterior arches can be
approximated until the opening of the isthmus is obliterated;
the passage of food and fluids from the oral pharynx into
the naso-pharynx is thus prevented.
The arcus glosso-palatinus and the arcus pharyngo-palatinus
form, on each lateral wall of the oral pharynx, the anterior and
posterior limits of a triangular interval in which is lodged the
tonsil. The upper part of this area, above the level of the
tonsil, presents a small depression termed the supra-tonsillar
fossa.
In the child, and not uncommonly in the adult, a triangular
fold of mucous membrane, the plica triangularis, extends
posteriorly from the lower part of the glosso-palatine arch
and the base of the tongue across the surface of the tonsil.
The upper border of the fold may be free or it may become
attached to a greater or- less extent to the surface of the
tonsil.
Pars Laryngea.—The laryngeal portion of the pharyngeal
cavity diminishes rapidly in width to the level at which it be-
comes continuous with the oesophagus. In its anterior wall, from
above downwards, may be seen: (1) the epiglottis; (2) the
superior aperture of the larynx with the recessus piriformis on
either side; and (3) the posterior surfaces of the arytenoid
and cricoid cartilages, covered with muscles and mucous
membrane.
Aditus Laryngis.—The superior aperture of the larynx,
situated below the pharyngeal part of the tongue, is a
large, obliquely placed opening which slopes rapidly from
above downwards and posteriorly. It is somewhat triangular
in outline, and the basal part of the opening, placed above and
anteriorly, is formed by the free border of the epiglottis.
379
Posteriorly, the opening rapidly narrows, and finally ends in
the interval between the two arytenoid cartilages. The
sides of the aperture are formed by two sharp and prominent
folds of mucous membrane, termed the ary-epiglottic folds,
which connect the lateral margins of the epiglottis with the
arytenoid cartilages. Two small nodules of cartilage, in the
posterior part of each ary-epiglottic fold, give rise to two
rounded eminences, of which the anterior is the cuneiform
tubercle, and the posterior the corniculate tubercle.
On either side of the lower part of the laryngeal open-
ing there is a small three - sided or pyramidal depression,
called the recessus piriformis. On the lateral side it is

bounded by the posterior part of the lamina of the thyreoid
cartilage and the thyreo-hyoid membrane; on the medial side
by the arytaenoid cartilage and the ary-epiglottic fold; whilst its
posterior wall is formed by the posterior wall of the pharynx,
when this is in place. The recessus piriformis presents a
wide entrance, which looks upwards; but it rapidly narrows
towards the bottom (Figs. 1 50 and 151); and it is important to
the surgeon because in this little pocket foreign bodies intro-
duced into the pharynx are liable to be caught.
Below the opening of the larynx, the anterior and posterior
walls of the pharynx are always closely applied to each other,
except during the passage of food.
The oesophageal opening is placed opposite the lower border
HEAD AND NECK
of the cricoid cartilage. This is the narrowest part of the
pharynx.
Velum Palatinum.—The soft palate is a movable curtain,
which projects downwards and posteriorly into the pharynx.
During deglutition it is raised, and helps to shut off the
nasal part of the pharynx from the portion below. Anteriorly,
it is attached to the posterior margin of the hard palate; on
each side it is connected with the lateral wall of the pharynx;
whilst posteriorly it presents a free border. From the centre
of this free margin the conical process, termed the uvula,
projects; whilst the sharp concave part of the border, on either
side of the uvula, becomes continuous with the pharyngo-
palatine arch, which descends on the side wall of the pharynx.
The upper surface of the soft palate is convex and continuous
with the floor of the nasal cavities; the inferior surface is
concave and forms part of the vaulted roof of the mouth.
From the posterior part of this surface on each side a glosso-
palatine arch curves downwards; and along its median plane
may be seen a slightly marked median ridge or raphe.
The soft palate is composed of a fold of mucous membrane,
between the two layers of which are interposed muscular,
aponeurotic, and glandular structures, together with blood
vessels and nerves.

The racemose mucous glands in the soft palate form a very
thick layer, immediately subjacent to the mucous membrane
which clothes its inferior surface. Close to the posterior
border of the hard palate the soft palate contains very few
muscular fibres; there it is composed chiefly of the two
layers of mucous membrane enclosing the glands, and the
palatal aponeurosis.

Dissection.—The dissection of the soft palate is difficult, and it is only
in a fresh part that the precise relations of the different muscular layers
can be made out. Begin by rendering it tense by means of a hook, and
then remove carefully the mucous membrane from its upper and lower
surfaces, and also from the glosso- and pharyngo-palatine arches. The
latter proceeding will expose the glosso - palatine and the pharyngo-
palatine muscles on each side.
Musculus Glosso-palatinus.—The glosso-palatinus is a
delicate muscular slip, which arises from the side of the
posterior part of the tongue and curves upwards and medially
to reach the under surface of the soft palate, above the
glandular layer. There its fibres spread out and become
continuous with the corresponding fasciculi of the opposite
side. It forms the lowest muscular stratum of the soft
paiate.
Musculus Pharyngo-palatinus.—The pharyngo-palatinus
forms two muscular strata in the soft palate which enclose,
between them, the musculus uvulae and the levatores palati
muscles. The upper layer is very weak and confined to the
posterior part of the velum. It constitutes the most super-
ficial muscular stratum on the upper aspect of the soft palate,
and becomes continuous with the corresponding portion of the
muscle of the opposite side. The deeper layer takes origin
from the posterior margin of the palate bone and from the
palatal aponeurosis, and some of its fibres mingle with those
of the corresponding muscle of the opposite side. Lateral to
the soft palate the two strata come together, and are joined
by one or two delicate muscular slips which spring from the
lower border of the cartilage of the auditory tube. These
slips are sometimes described as the salpingo-pharyngeus muscle.
The pharyngo-palatinus, thus formed, arches downwards and
posteriorly in the posterior arch of the fauces, and spreads
out into a thin sheet of fibres in the wall of the pharynx.
Blending to some extent with the stylo-pharyngeus, it is inserted
into the posterior border of the thyreoid cartilage. Some of
its fibres, however, incline posteriorly and are inserted into
the pharyngeal aponeurosis.
Musculus Uvulae.—This delicate muscle is placed on the
upper aspect of the soft palate, and, posteriorly, it is covered
by the superficial fibres of the pharyngo-palatinus. These
must be removed to expose it fully. It consists of two
minute slips which, as a rule, arise from the posterior nasal
spine of the hard palate, and lie one on either side of the
HEAD AND NECK
median plane. As they pass posteriorly into the uvula they
unite into a single rounded muscular bundle.
Dissection.—The levator palati muscle has been seen already on the
outer aspect of the pharynx in the sinus of Morgagni. To display it from
the inside it is necessary to remove the wall of the pharynx between the
auditory tube above and the upper border of the superior constrictor
below, and then follow its fibres into the soft palate. In a well-injected
subject the dissector will observe the ascending palatine artery in rela-
tion to this muscle.
Musculus Levator Veli Palatini.—The levator palati is a
rounded fleshy muscle which arises from the lower and medial
border of the cartilage of the auditory tube, and from the
rough surface on the under aspect of the apex of the petrous
part of the temporal bone. It passes downwards and an-
teriorly, crosses the upper border of the superior constrictor,
pierces the pharyngeal aponeurosis, passes below the orifice of
the auditory tube and enters the soft palate. There its fibres
spread out below the uvular muscle and above the anterior
or deep portion of the pharyngo-palatinus. Anteriorly, some
of the fibres are inserted into the palatal aponeurosis; but
more posteriorly, the majority of the fibres become continu-
ous with the corresponding fasciculi of the opposite side.
Musculus Tensor Veli Palatini.—The origin of the tensor
veli palatini and the relations of its muscular belly were noted on
p. 293. The muscle descends from the base of the skull along
the lateral surface of the medial pterygoid lamina, and ends
in a tendon which turns horizontally towards the median plane,
below the hamulus, where a bursa mucosa facilitates the play
of the tendon on the bone. In the soft palate the tendon ex-
pands below the lower layer of the pharyngo-palatinus, and some
of its fibres blend with the palatal aponeurosis whilst others
gain attachment to the horizontal part of the palate bone.
Palatal Aponeurosis.—The palatal aponeurosis extends
posteriorly from the posterior margin of the hard palate to
give strength and support to the soft palate. At first it
is strongly marked, but it weakens rapidly as it passes
posteriorly. The small portion of the soft palate which it
supports contains few muscular fibres, and remains always
more or less horizontal in position. The much more extensive
posterior muscular part of the soft palate constitutes the
movable sloping portion. The tensor palati operates upon
the anterior aponeurotic portion of the soft palate.
383
Vessels and Nerves of the Soft Palate.—The ascending
palatine branch of the external maxillary artery is, as a rule,
the principal artery of supply to the soft palate. It has
already been traced on the wall of the pharynx (p. 299),
where it lies in the sinus of Morgagni, in relation to the
levator palati muscle, which it accompanies into the soft palate.
The palatine branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery may
also be traced into the soft palate. In cases where the
preceding artery is small, this twig will be found enlarged
so as to take its place (p. 304). The descending palatine
branch of the internal maxillary artery also sends small twigs
to the soft palate and tonsil.
Two nerves enter the soft palate from the spheno-palatine ganglion—viz.
the posterior palatine and the middle palatine nerve. It would appear,
however, that they do not supply the muscles, but are distributed to the
mucous membrane. The levator palati, the musculus uvulae, the glosso-
palatinus, and the pharyngo-palatinus are supplied by twigs from the
pharyngeal branches of the vagus, which convey to them fibres which are
originally derived from the cerebral part of the accessory nerve [v. p. 315)
(W. Aldren Turner). The tensor palati is probably supplied by the
branch which it receives from the otic ganglion, which conveys to it fibres
originally derived from the motor part of the trigeminal nerve.
Tonsillae Palatini.—The palatine tonsils are two prominent
masses of lymphoid tissue, placed one on each lateral wall
of the pharynx, in the triangular interval between the two
palatine arches and immediately above the pharyngeal part
of the tongue. The pharyngeal or internal surface of the
tonsil is covered with mucous membrane and presents a
number of orifices which lead into crypts or recesses in its
substance. The deep or external surface is embedded in the
pharyngeal wall and is supported by the superior constrictor
muscle of the pharynx (see p. 298). It is covered by a layer
of fibrous tissue which forms an incomplete capsule for the
organ. It is important to note that between the tonsil and
the superior constrictor there is some lax connective tissue, so
that the organ can be pulled forwards by the volsellum with-
out dragging the wall of the pharynx with it.
The tonsils have a rich blood-supply. They derive arterial
twigs from the tonsillar and ascending palatine branches of
the external maxillary, the descending palatine branch of the
internal maxillary, the ascending pharyngeal, and the dorsalis
linguae.
Tuba Auditiva (O.T. Eustachian Tube).—This is the
HEAD AND NECK
canal which conveys air from the pharynx to the tympanic
cavity. It is divided into two portions, according to the parts
which enter into the construction of its wall. Thus, in the
lateral part of its course, as it nears the tympanic cavity, its
wall is bony, and it runs in the interval between the tympanic
and petrous portions of the temporal bone. The medial part
consists mainly of cartilage. It is placed on the base of the
skull, and is lodged in the gutter or groove between the
petrous part of the temporal bone and the great wing of the
sphenoid. This is the subdivision of the tube which comes
under the notice of the dissector at the present stage, and
he should first note its direction and then study its relations
and the construction of its wall.
The direction of the canal can be readily ascertained by
passing a probe into it through its pharyngeal orifice. It runs
postero-laterally with a slight inclination upwards and passes
first above and then to the lateral side of the levator palati,
and along the medial side of the upper part of the tensor palati.
It lies, therefore, in a considerable part of its extent between
the two muscles.
Before removing the mucous membrane from the
pharyngeal part of the tube the dissector should note that at
the lower margin of the orifice there is a prominent rounded
eminence, the levator cushion, due to the subjacent levator veli
palatini. The removal of the mucous membrane will reveal the
fact that the wall of the tube is formed, in great part, by a
triangular plate of cartilage, which is folded upon itself so
as to protect the tube on its upper and medial aspects. The
cartilage is deficient below and laterally, its place being
taken by dense fibrous tissue, which connects the margins
of the cartilage and completes the wall of the canal. The
projecting free base of the cartilage gives rise to the torus
tubarius already examined on the lateral wall of the naso-
pharynx (p. 376). A muscular slip, which descends from the
lateral margin of the cartilage, in relation to the outer un-
protected side of the tube, has been termed the dilatator tuba
(Rudinger). It joins the tensor palati. The interior of the
tube is lined with mucous membrane continuous with that
of the pharynx and the tympanic cavity; and its calibre varies
considerably in different parts of its course. It is narrowest
at a point termed the isthmus, situated at the junction of
the osseous and cartilaginous parts. As the tube is traced
385
thence to the pharynx it gradually increases in calibre, and it
attains its greatest width at its opening into the naso-pharynx.
CAROTID CANAL.
The carotid canal, which traverses the interior of the
petrous part of the temporal bone, contains the internal
carotid artery, the internal carotid continuation of the cervical
sympathetic and a plexus of veins.
Dissection.—The carotid canal may be opened up by removing its
inferior wall with the bone forceps. In doing this, it is not necessary to
interfere with the auditory tube, which lies in close proximity. The dis-
section must be made on one side only.
Arteria Carotis Interna.—The internal carotid artery in
this part of its course is about three-quarters of an inch long.
At first it ascends vertically; then, bending suddenly, it runs
horizontally antero-medially. It emerges from the canal at
the apex of the petrous bone and enters the foramen lacerum,
where it turns upwards, pierces the external layer of the dura
mater, and enters the middle fossa of the skull. From this
point onwards the internal carotid artery has been examined
already (p. 331). Whilst within the carotid canal it lies
below and anterior to the cochlea and the tympanic cavity.
The great superficial petrosal nerve and the semilunar
ganglion are placed above it, but are separated from it by a
thin plate of bone, which is, however, sometimes absent.
Nervus Caroticus Internus.—The dissector has already
noted this large branch proceeding from the upper end of
the superior cervical ganglion and entering the carotid canal
with the internal carotid artery. It divides almost im-
mediately into two parts, which are placed on either side of
the artery. Each of these soon divides into a number of
branches which communicate together around the internal
carotid artery forming the internal carotid plexus. The
further dissection of these branches is a matter of some
difficulty, and can be satisfactorily effected only under
specially favourable circumstances.
At the posterior end of the cavernous sinus a ganglion is sometimes
found in the plexus, and where the sixth nerve crosses the internal carotid
artery the plexus is very dense. This part is known as the cavernous
plexus. At the anterior end of the cavernous sinus the carotid plexus
VOL. II—25
HEAD AND NECK
breaks up into branches which accompany the anterior and middle cerebral
arteries.
The internal carotid plexus communicates with the tympanic plexus by
means of superior and inferior carotico-tympanic branches given off in the
carotid canal, and with the spheno-palatine ganglion by the great deep
petrosal branch, which unites with the great superficial petrosal of the facial
nerve to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal (O.T. Vidian). It gives
branches also to the semilunar ganglion, the third, fourth, sixth and the
ophthalmic branch of the fifth nerve, and a branch which accompanies the
naso-ciliary nerve into the orbit and joins the ciliary ganglion.
NERVUS MAXILLARIS.
As the maxillary nerve passes anteriorly, from the semilunar
ganglion to the face, it traverses the foramen rotundum, the
upper part of the pterygo-palatine fossa, the pterygo-maxillary
fissure, the inferior orbital fissure and the infra-orbital canal.
The dissector should therefore proceed to expose the nerve
in these localities.
Dissection.—Remove the temporal muscle and the upper head of the
external pterygoid muscle, and, placing the saw upon the cut margin of the
skull at a point immediately above the external meatus, carry it obliquely
downwards and anteriorly through the squamous part of the temporal
bone and the great wing of the sphenoid, towards the medial end of the
superior orbital fissure. This saw-cut should enter the superior orbital
fissure immediately to the lateral side of the foramen rotundum. A
second saw-cut should then be made from the cut margin of the cranial
wall, immediately above the anterior margin of the great wing of the
sphenoid bone, downwards into the superior orbital fissure to meet the first
saw-cut. The wedge-shaped piece of bone included between these cuts
can now be removed. Additional space may be obtained, and the pterygo-
palatine fossa may be more fully opened up, by removing what remains of
the great wing of the sphenoid upon the lateral side of the foramen rotundum,
but the circumference of this aperture must be carefully preserved. Proceed,
in the next place, to open up the infra-orbital canal. In its posterior part
its upper wall is usually so thin that it can easily be removed by a pair
of dissecting forceps, but anteriorly it sinks deeply under the lower part of
the rim of the orbital opening, and here the chisel must be employed.
The maxillary nerve can now be defined and its branches displayed.
The infra - orbital artery and vein, which accompany the nerve in the
infra-orbital canal, will be exposed at the same time.
Nervus Maxillaris.—The maxillary nerve springs from the
semilunar ganglion within the cranial cavity (p. 330). It is
composed entirely of sensory fibres, and passes anteriorly,
outside the dura mater and in relation to the lower part of the
cavernous sinus, to the foramen rotundum through which it
enters the pterygo-palatine fossa. It crosses the upper part
of this fossa, curves laterally through the pterygo-maxillary
NERVUS MAXILLARIS
387
fissure into the infra-temporal fossa, and, near the middle
of the inferior orbital fissure, enters the infra-orbital canal,
where it receives the name of infra-orbital. The infra-
orbital canal traverses the floor of the orbit, which, it should
be remembered, forms the roof of the maxillary sinus
also. Finally, the nerve emerges upon the face through
the infra-orbital foramen, and breaks up, under cover of the
quadratus labii superioris, into numerous branches which
form a dense plexus with twigs from the facial nerve. Its

terminal filaments are distributed to the lower eyelid, the
nose, and the upper lip. The course of the maxillary nerve
may be separated into five stages, in each of which branches
are given off. These are :—

HEAD AND NECK
The zygomatic nerve, which has already been dissected
in the orbit, can now be traced to its origin from the
maxillary nerve in the infra-temporal fossa. The spheno-
palatine branches are two stout twigs which arise from the
under aspect of the maxillary nerve, and proceed vertically
downwards, in the pterygo-palatine fossa, to the spheno-palatine
ganglion, of which they constitute the sensory roots.
Nervi Alveolares Superiores.—These are usually three in
number, and are distinguished as posterior, middle, and
anterior. The middle superior alveolar nerve is sometimes
absent as a separate trunk, in which case it arises in common
with the anterior superior alveolar branch.
The posterior superior alveolar nerve takes origin in the
infra-temporal fossa, and almost immediately divides into
two branches, which proceed downwards upon the posterior
aspect of the body of the maxilla. They contribute a few
fine filaments to the mucous membrane of the cheek and
to the gum, and then disappear into the minute posterior
dental foramina to supply the three molar teeth and the lining
membrane of the maxillary sinus.
The middle superior alveolar nerve supplies the two
premolar teeth. It arises from the infra-orbital nerve, and
can be easily detected (when present) by gently raising the
parent trunk from the floor of the infra-orbital canal. It
descends in a minute canal which traverses the lateral wall
of the maxillary sinus.
The anterior superior alveolar nerve, much the largest of
the three alveolar branches, springs from the infra-orbital as it
approaches the anterior part of the canal. It can be brought
into view by raising the parent trunk from the floor of the
canal, and it will then be seen to enter a special bony tunnel
which traverses the maxilla in the anterior wall of the
maxillary sinus. The dissector should endeavour to open
up this canal with the chisel. After supplying a branch to
the mucous membrane of the lower and anterior part of
the nasal cavity, the anterior superior alveolar nerve divides
into branches for the incisor and the canine teeth.
While traversing the maxilla, the three superior alveolar branches
communicate with each other, and form two nerve-loops (Fig. 152).
Numerous twigs proceed from these, and join in a fine plexus. It is from
this plexus that the terminal filaments to the teeth and gum take origin.
Arteria Infra-orbitalis.—The infra-orbital artery is a
NASAL CAVITIES
389
branch of the internal maxillary. It arises in the pterygo-
palatine fossa and accompanies the infra-orbital nerve. In
the face its terminal twigs anastomose with branches of the
external maxillary, transverse facial, and buccinator arteries;
in the infra-orbital canal it gives some fine branches to the
contents of the orbital cavity, and also the anterior superior
alveolar artery which accompanies the nerve of that name,
and supplies the incisor and canine teeth, and the lining
membrane of the maxillary sinus.
The infra-orbital vein joins the pterygoid plexus.
NASAL CAVITIES.
Dissection.—The portion of the mandible which still remains, together
with the tongue and larynx, must now be removed from the upper part of
the skull. From the angle of the mouth on each side carry the knife
posteriorly, through the buccinator and the mucous membrane of the cheek,
the pterygo mandibular raphe, and the lateral wall of the pharynx. The
internal pterygoid muscle has been divided already, but it will be necessary
to cut the internal carotid artery, the smaller vessels which are still un-
divided and the nerves which still connect the pharynx with the skull. The
larynx and tongue must be laid aside for future dissection.
The anterior part of the skull should next be divided into two lateral parts
by sawing through it in the sagittal direction close to one side of the nasal
septum. As a general rule the nasal septum is not vertical, but deviates
more or less to one or other side of the median plane. This deviation is
more frequently directed to the right than to the left side. Endeavour to
determine the direction which it takes in the skull under observation,
by passing a probe into the nasal cavity through the choanae. The
section through the skull should be made close to the concave side of the
septum. Begin anteriorly by introducing a knife into the nostril of that side,
and carry it upwards through the cartilaginous part of the nose to the nasal
bone. Then place the specimen so that the face rests upon the table, and
divide the soft palate in the median plane. The section may now be
completed by sawing through the hard palate and bony roof of the nasal
cavity to the side of the median plane. The dissector should make every
effort to preserve the septum of the nose intact. As a general rule the
upper concha is partially injured. This is not a very serious matter, as
the lateral aspect of the nasal cavity can be studied upon the opposite side
when the septum of the nose has been removed.
Septum Nasi.—The nasal septum divides the cavity of
the nose into two narrow chambers—the right and left nasal
cavities. It is not placed accurately in the median plane,
but almost invariably shows a bulging or deviation to one
or other side (more frequently to the right side). Im-
mediately above the orifice of the nostril or anterior aperture
of the nasal cavity, the septum shows a slight depression,
HEAD AND NECK
which corresponds to the vestibule of the nose, and forms
the medial wall of this subdivision of the nasal cavity.
The vestibular part of the partition is clothed with skin,
continuous with the external integument; from this a
number of stiff hairs, termed vibrissa, project. Over the
rest of its extent the septum nasi is covered with mucous
membrane, which is closely adherent to the subjacent peri-
osteum forming with it a muco-periosteum; and it is

separable into two districts, viz., a lower or respiratory
area, and a much smaller upper or olfactory area, comprising
not more than the upper third of the septum, in which
branches of the olfactory nerve spread out. The respiratory
mucous membrane is very thick and spongy. It is highly
vascular and contains numerous mucous glands. The minute
orifices of the gland ducts can be detected by the naked
eye. Over the olfactory district of the septum the mucous
membrane is softer and more delicate, and not so thick. In
the fresh state it presents a yellowish colour, and the glands
are smaller.
391
In favourable cases a minute orifice may be detected in the mucous
membrane, on the lower and anterior part of the nasal septum, immediately
posterior to the vestibular area. It is placed above the anterior end of a
well-marked elongated projection which passes obliquely posteriorly and
upwards, and corresponds to the thickened lower margin of the septal
cartilage. This aperture varies in diameter from J mm. to 1j mm.
(Schwalbe). It leads into a narrow canal, which passes posteriorly for
a short distance, and then ends blindly. It is of interest because it
represents in the human subject the rudiment of the vomcro-nasal organ
(O.T. organ of Jacobson), a tubular structure which is highly developed in
some of the lower animals.
Construction of the Nasal Septum.—Strip the muco-
periosteum from the exposed surface of the septum nasi and
the parts forming the septum will be rendered visible. The
bulk of the partition is composed of the perpendicular lamina
of the ethmoid and the vomer posteriorly, and of the septal
cartilage anteriorly. Small portions of other bones take a
minor part in its construction. Thus, above and posteriorly
there are the crest and rostrum of the sphenoid; above and
anteriorly is the nasal spine of the frontal bone; whilst below
there is the crest of bone formed by the apposition of the
palatal processes of the palate and maxillary bones of opposite
sides.
Cartilago Septi Nasi.—The septal cartilage fills up the
wide angular gap which intervenes between the perpendicular
lamina of the ethmoid and the vomer, and it projects anteriorly
towards the point of the nose. It is a broad irregularly
quadrilateral plate. Its upper and posterior border is in ap-
position with the anterior border of the perpendicular lamina
of the ethmoid; its lower and posterior border, much thickened,
is received into the groove in the anterior border of the vomer
and the nasal crest of the maxillae. The angle between these
two borders is prolonged posteriorly, for a varying distance,
in the form of a tongue-shaped cartilaginous process, which
occupies the interval between the two plates of the vomer.
The upper and anterior border of the septal cartilage is in
contact above with the suture between the two nasal bones;
below this it is related to the two lateral cartilages of the
nose, whilst still lower down it is seen in the interval between
the two larger alar cartilages.
Its connection with the lateral cartilage on each side is a very intimate
one; indeed, below the nasal bones, the three cartilages are directly
continuous, but lower down they are separated by a fissure which runs
upwards for some distance on each side. The lower and anterior border is
very short; it is free, and extends posteriorly to the anterior nasal spine.
HEAD AND NECK
The anterior angle of the septal cartilage is blunt and rounded, and does not
reach to the point of the nose, which is formed by the alar cartilages.
The deviation of the septum nasi from the median plane will now (in all
probability) be seen to be due to a bulging to one side of the vomer and
perpendicular lamina of the ethmoid along their line of union. It is not
developed until after the seventh year.
Dissection.—The septal cartilage and thin bony part of the septum
must now be removed piecemeal. This must be done very carefully, as
it is necessary to preserve intact the muco-periosteum which clothes the
opposite side of the septum. It is in this muco-periosteum that the nerves
and blood vessels must be examined.
Vessels and Nerves of the Septum Nasi.—The following
is a list of the nerves :—
Nerves of Smell, . Olfactory.
I. Naso-palatine.
Nerves of Common
sensation, .
Medial nasal branch of the anterior eth-
moidal nerve.
Nasal branches from spheno- palatine
ganglion and from the nerve of the
pterygoid canal (O.T. Vidian).
The Medial Group of Olfactory Nerves.—These nerves are
distributed in the muco-periosteum of the upper part of the nasal
septum and are barely distinguishable, except in a fresh part;
further, they are so soft that it is hardly possible to isolate
them. They enter the nasal cavity through the medial series
of apertures in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and pro-
ceed downwards in grooves on the surface of the perpen-
dicular lamina of the same bone.
Nervus Naso-palatinus.—The naso-palatine nerve is a
long slender twig which can easily be detected upon the deep
surface of the muco-periosteum of the septum. It springs from
spheno-palatine ganglion, and enters the nasal cavity through
the spheno-palatine foramen. In the first part of its course
it runs medially upon the inferior surface of the body of the
sphenoid. Having gained the nasal septum, it changes its
direction and passes downwards and anteriorly, in a shallow
groove on the surface of the vomer under cover of the muco-
periosteum. Finally it enters the foramen of Scarpa, and,
where the two foramina of Scarpa open into the common
incisive foramen, the nerves of opposite sides unite in a plexus
from which branches are given to the mucous membrane
covering the anterior part of the hard palate. The naso-
palatine nerve is accompanied by the posterior nasal septal
artery; and, as it lies on the surface of the vomer, it supplies
some small twigs to the muco-periosteum of the septum nasi.
393
A few nasal branches from the spheno-palatine ganglion, and
also from the nerve of the pterygoid canal, reach the muco-
periosteum over the superior and posterior part of the septum.
They are very minute, and it is questionable if the dissector
will be able to discover any trace of them in an ordinary part.
The medial nasal branches of the anterior ethmoidal nerve
will be found descending over the anterior part of the nasal
septum. They may be traced as far as the vestibule.
The arteries which convey blood to the septum nasi are:
(1) the posterior nasal septal, which accompanies the naso-
palatine nerve; (2) a branch of the anterior ethmoidal accom-
panying the medial branches of the anterior ethmoidal nerve;
(3) some minute twigs to the upper part of the septum from
the posterior ethmoidal artery; (4) the septal branch of the
superior labial artery, which is distributed upon the columna
nasi.
Dissection.—The muco-periosteum of the septum may now be divided,
by the scissors, along the roof of the nasal cavity. Before doing this,
disengage from its surface the naso-palatine nerve and the medial branches
of the anterior ethmoidal nerve, in order that they may be afterwards traced
to their origins. When the layer of muco-periosteum, thus detached from
the roof of the nose, is thrown down the nasal cavity is exposed.
Cava Nasi. —The nasal cavities are two chambers placed
one on each side of the septum nasi. They are narrow, but
the vertical depth and antero-posterior length of each cavity
is very considerable. The width increases somewhat from
above downwards; thus, in the upper part, the superior
concha is separated from the septum by an interval of only
2 mm., whilst lower down a space of 4 or 5 mm. intervenes
between the inferior concha and the septum. Each nasal
cavity presents a medial wall formed by the septum, a lateral
wall, a roof, a floor, and an anterior and a posterior aperture.
The anterior apertures of the nasal cavities, or nostrils, are
two oval orifices which open upon the face and look down-
wards. The posterior apertures, or choana, open into the naso-
pharynx and look posteriorly and downwards.
The narrow roof of the nasal cavity consists of an inter-
mediate horizontal portion formed by the cribriform plate of
the ethmoid bone, and of an anterior and a posterior sloping
part. The anterior part is formed by the narrow grooved
nasal surface of the frontal spine of the frontal bone, the
nasal bone, and the angle between the lateral cartilage and
HEAD AND NECK
the septal cartilage. The posterior pari of the roof is com-
posed of the anterior and under surfaces of the body of the
sphenoid, and also of the ala of the vomer, the sphenoidal
process of the palate bone, and the vaginal process of the
medial pterygoid lamina, all of which are applied to the under
surface of the sphenoidal body.

F1g. 154.—Posterior aspect of Frontal section through the Nasal
Cavities opposite the Crista Galli of the Ethmoid Bone.
The upper arrow shows the opening of an anterior ethmoidal cell into the hiatus
semilunaris. The lower arrow passes from the maxillary sinus into the hiatus
semilunaris.
The floor of the nasal cavity is of considerable width. It is
formed by the palatal processes of the maxilla and the palate
bones, and is concave from side to side. Further, it presents
a gentle antero-posterior slope, being slightly higher anteriorly
than posteriorly. On the anterior part of the floor, and close
to the septum nasi, the dissector may see a minute funnel-
shaped depression of the muco-periosteum into the incisive
foramen. This is of interest from a developmental point of
view; for it is a vestige of the extensive communication which
395
existed in the embryo between the cavities of the nose and the
mouth.
Lateral Wall of the Nasal Cavity.—The lateral wall of
the nasal cavity is rendered uneven and complicated by the
projection of the three conchae (O.T. turbinal bones).
The part which the different bones take in the formation of the lateral
wall of the cavity of the nose must in the first place be studied in a
sagittal section through the macerated skull, and the dissector should
constantly refer to such a preparation during the dissection. Anteriorly, it
is formed by the lateral cartilage, the alar cartilage, the nasal bone, and the
frontal process of the maxilla. More posteriorly the lacrimal, the ethmoid,
and the inferior concha, with a small portion of the body of the maxilla,
enter into its construction; whilst still more posteriorly are the perpen-
dicular part of the palate bone and the medial pterygoid lamina of the
sphenoid. Placed in relation to the lateral aspect of this wall are the
ethmoidal air-cells, which intervene between the upper part of the nasal
cavity and the orbit, whilst, at a lower level, the great air sinus of the
maxilla, the maxillary sinus, is situated immediately to the lateral side of
the nasal cavity (Fig. 154).
Turning now to the dissection, the dissector will see that
the lateral wall is separable into three areas or districts.
These are—(1) the vestibule; (2) the atrium meatus medii;
(3) the region of the conchae and the intervening meatuses.
'Vestibulum Nasi.—The vestibular part (Fig. 155, 6, 6')
of the lateral wall is a depression of a somewhat oval form
placed immediately above the aperture of the nostril. It is
partially divided into an upper and lower portion by a short
ridge, which projects anteriorly from its posterior boundary;
and it is clothed throughout with integument continuous with
the skin. From this a number of stout, stiff hairs, termed
vibrissa, project (Fig. 155, 5). The vibrissae which spring
from the anterior part of the region incline posteriorly, whilst
those which are implanted into the posterior part are directed
anteriorly; in this manner a sieve-like arrangement is provided
at the anterior aperture of the nose. The vestibular part of
the lateral wall is placed opposite the corresponding area on
the septum nasi, and the two together constitute an ampullated
entrance to the nasal cavity. The capacity and shape of this
section of the cavity is influenced to a certain extent by the

which is present in some mammals. A slight depression
above the agger nasi, which leads posteriorly to the olfactory
district of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, is the sulcus
olfactorius.
Conchae (O.T. turbinal bones).—Posterior to the vestibule
397
and the atrium are the conchae with the intervening meatuses.
The superior concha (Fig. 155, 12), which projects from the
labyrinth of the ethmoid bone, is very short, and is placed
on the upper and posterior part of the lateral wall of the
cavity. Its free border begins a short distance below the
centre of the cribriform plate, and passes obliquely down-
wards and posteriorly to a point immediately below the
body of the sphenoid, where it ends. The middle concha
(Fig. 155, i4) also is a part of the ethmoid. Its free border
begins a short distance below the anterior end of the cribri-
form plate, and at first takes a vertical course downwards; then,
bending suddenly, it passes posteriorly, and it ends midway
between the body of the sphenoid and the posterior border
of the hard palate. The inferior concha (Fig. 155, 15) is an
independent bone; it extends posteriorly upon the lateral
wall of the nasal cavity, midway between the middle concha
and the floor of the nose. Its lower free margin is some-
what convex downwards.
Meatus Nasi.—The superior meatus (Fig. 155, 13) is a short
narrow fissure between the superior and middle conchae.
The posterior ethmoidal cells open into its upper and anterior
part by one, or, in some cases, by several apertures.
To bring these orifices into view, the superior concha should be
turned aside by introducing the blade of a pair of forceps under its entire
length, and forcing it upwards. Care should be taken not to injure the
mucous membrane more than is necessary.
The middle meatus is a much more roomy passage which
extends posteriorly from the atrium, between the middle and
inferior conchae.
The middle concha should be forcibly tilted upwards and posteriorly.
The upper and anterior part of the middle meatus leads into
a funnel-shaped passage which runs upwards into the corre-
sponding frontal sinus. This passage, the infundibulum, con-
stitutes the channel of communication between the frontal
sinus and the nasal cavity.
Upon the lateral wall of the middle meatus a deep curved
groove or gutter, which commences at the infundibulum and
runs from above downwards and posteriorly, will be seen.
In this groove, which is termed the hiatus semilunaris (Fig.
156), are the openings of the anterior ethmoidal cells and
HEAD AND NECK
the maxillary sinus. The upper boundary of the hiatus
semilunaris is prominent and bulging. It is termed the bulla
ethmoidalis. On or above the bulla is the aperture of the
middle ethmoidal cells (Fig. 156). The slit-like opening of
the maxillary sinus lies in the posterior part of the hiatus
semilunaris.
The dissector should now open up the maxillary sinus by removing
its lateral wall. This may be done by sawing upwards through the root of
the zygomatic process of the maxilla.

municates with the middle meatus lies in the medial wall
of the cavity much nearer the roof than the floor—a position
highly unfavourable for the escape of fluids which may
collect in it. Sometimes, however, a second orifice, circular
in outline, will be found. This is situated lower down; when
it is present it opens into the middle meatus, immediately
above the middle point of the attached margin of the inferior
concha.
The dissector should note that, on account of the relationship of the
infundibulum to the hiatus semilunaris and of the latter to the opening
of the maxillary sinus, there is a tendency, in some cases, for the secretion
of the frontal sinuses to flow into the maxillary sinus.
399
The inferior meatus is the horizontal passage which lies
between the inferior concha and the floor and lateral wall
of the nasal cavity. It is placed posterior to the vestibule,
and the free border of the inferior concha turns downwards
and limits it anteriorly (Fig. 156). On this account, and
because its floor slopes downwards and posteriorly, the in-
ferior meatus is more accessible to the current of expired
air than to the current of inspired air. In the anterior part
of this meatus will be found the opening of the naso-lacrimal
duct which conveys the tears to the nasal cavity (Fig. 156).
To bring the aperture of the naso lacrimal canal into view, remove
a small portion of the anterior part of the inferior concha with the
scissors.
The orifice of the naso-lacrimal duct varies in form,
according to the manner in which the mucous membrane is
arranged around it. Sometimes it is wide, patent, and circular;
at other times the mucous membrane is prolonged over
the opening, reducing its size and acting as a flap valve to
the orifice. In some cases, indeed, the orifice may be so
minute that it is difficult to find. Its continuity with
the lacrimal sac should in all cases be established by passing
a probe from above downwards through the naso-lacrimal
canal (Fig. 64).
A fourth meatus is generally present on the lateral wall of
the nasal cavity. This is due to the partial subdivision of
the superior concha into an upper and lower part by a short
groove which proceeds anteriorly from the anterior aspect
of the body of the sphenoid. This additional meatus is
termed the recessus spheno-ethmoidalis, and in its posterior
part is the aperture of the sphenoidal air sinus (Fig. 156).
This orifice may be circular or slit-like, according to the
manner in which the mucous membrane is disposed around
it.1 The upper portion of the superior concha which
is placed above this additional meatus is called the concha
suprema (Fig. 155, 10).
To the narrow cleft-like portion of the nasal cavity which
extends from the roof to the floor between the septum
medially and the conchae laterally the term meatus communis
is applied; and the part of the cavity which lies posterior

is the naso-pharyngeal meatus (Fig. 155, 17).
Muco-periosteum of the Lateral Wall of the Cavum Nasi.
—It has been noted that the vestibule is lined with integument.
The remainder of the lateral wall, as well as the roof and floor
of the nasal fossa, is lined with mucous membrane which is
so closely blended with the subjacent periosteum that the
two are inseparable and form a muco-periosteum. This
is continuous through the naso-lacrimal duct with the ocular
conjunctiva, through the various apertures with the delicate
lining membrane of the air-cells which open into the nasal
cavity, and through the choanae with the pharyngeal mucous
membrane. On the lateral wall, as on the septum, the
muco-periosteum is mapped out into an upper olfactory and
a lower respiratory portion. This subdivision cannot be
appreciated by the naked eye, for the one district passes
into the other without any sharp line of demarcation. The
olfactory region comprises merely the upper concha; the
respiratory region includes the middle and inferior conchse, the
middle meatus, the lower meatus, and the atrium. In the lower
part of the lateral wall the muco-periosteum is thick and
spongy. This is particularly noticeable over the lower borders
and posterior extremities of the middle and inferior conchae,
where the membrane presents an irregular surface and forms
soft bulging cushions. This condition is largely due to the
presence of a rich venous plexus, the vessels of which run
for the most part in an antero-posterior direction. In the
case of the lower concha, the veins are so numerous
that the muco-periosteum assumes the character of cavernous
tissue, and is sometimes spoken of as the "erectile body."
When turgid with blood it swells out and obliterates the
interval between the concha and the septum. The muco-
periosteum of the floor, meatuses, and the atrium, is
smoother than, and not so thick as, that over the conchas
Everywhere numerous mucous glands are embedded in it,
and the minute punctiform orif1ces of the ducts are visible to
the naked eye. In the olfactory region the lining membrane
of the nose, in the fresh state, is of a yellowish colour, and
it is softer and more delicate than in the respiratory part.
The great vascularity of the mucous membrane of the nose
is doubtless for the purpose of moistening and raising the
temperature of the inspired air.

Nerves and Vessels on the Lateral Wall of the Nasal

Sensation, . . j palatine ganglion and from the nerve of the
pterygoid canal.
.4. Two posterior inferior nasal branches from the
anterior palatine nerve.
The olfactory nerves are from twelve to twenty fine filaments
which spring from the lower surface and the extremity of the
olfactory bulb, and, passing through the apertures in the cribri-
form plate of the ethmoid into the nasal cavity, they separate
into a lateral and a medial group. To each nerve an invest-
ment from the cerebral membranes is given. The medial or
septal nerves were described on p. 392. The lateral nerves
descend in the muco-periosteum on the lateral wall of the nasal
cavity. At first lodged in shallow grooves or minute bony
canals, they soon divide into bunches of branches which spread
out over the upper concha and the region immediately below.
The dissection of these nerves is exceedingly difficult, but in
a well-preserved part they can generally be partially displayed.
The posterior superior nasal nerves, which come from the
spheno-palatine ganglion and from the nerve of the pterygoid
canal, are minute filaments, but the dissector should nevertheless
endeavour to trace them to their distribution upon the lateral
wall. Theyenter the nose through the spheno-palatine foramen,
which is situated at the posterior end of the superior meatus.
The best plan to adopt for their display is to trace the largest of the
group, the naso-palatine nerve, which has already been exposed on the nasal
septum, laterally across the roof of the nasal cavity. This will lead the
dissector to the foramen, and by carefully dissecting the muco-periosteum
"in its neighbourhood the other nerves of the group may be detected as they
enter the nasal cavity.
They are distributed to the muco-periosteum over the upper
and middle conchae, and the posterior part of the septum.
The inferior nasal nerves are two in number; they both
arise from the anterior palatine nerve.
Make a vertical incision, through the muco-periosteum over the posterior
part of the medial pterygoid lamina, and carefully raise the membrane
from the posterior part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.
The upper of the two inferior nasal nerves will be found
emerging through a small aperture in the perpendicular part
vol. 11—26
HEAD AND NECK
of the palate bone, at a point between the posterior extremities
of the middle and inferior conchae. It divides into an ascend-
ing and descending branch. Both run anteriorly; the former on
the middle concha, the latter on the inferior concha. The lower
of the two inferior nasal nerves appears through a foramen
in the perpendicular part of the palate bone, immediately
posterior to the inferior concha, upon which it is distributed.
The anterior ethmoidal nerve (O.T. nasal) should be ex-
posed as it descends in the groove upon the deep surface of
the nasal bone (p. 393). It gives medial branches to the
septum, and lateral branches to the muco-periosteum over the
anterior part of the lateral wall, and to the anterior parts of
the middle and inferior conchse.
The main artery of supply to the nasal muco-periosteum
is the spheno-palatine, a branch of the internal maxillary. It
gains entrance to the nasal cavity through the spheno-palatine
foramen, in company with the posterior superior nasal nerves.
The septal branch of this vessel accompanies the naso-palatine
nerve, whilst others are distributed upon the lateral wall of the
cavity. Several twigs are given also by the descending palatine
branch of the internal maxillary and the two ethmoidal arteries,
but these are small and will be seen only in cases where the
injection of the subject has been unusually successful.
SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION AND INTERNAL
MAXILLARY ARTERY.
The spheno-palatine ganglion is situated in the pterygo-
palatine fossa on the lateral side of the spheno-palatine fora-
men; and at this stage it can be exposed best by dissecting
from the medial or nasal side.
Dissection.—The muco-periosteum has already been removed from
the posterior part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity, and the inferior
nasal branches of the anterior palatine nerve have been found piercing the
perpendicular part of the palate bone. The dissector cannot fail to notice
the course taken by the trunk from which these filaments arise. The lamina
of bone which forms the medial wall of the pterygo-palatine canal is so
thin that the nerve can be distinctly seen through it. By carefully opening
up this canal with a chisel, and following the anterior palatine nerve upwards,
the dissector will be led to the ganglion in the pterygo-palatine fossa.
The naso-palatine nerve should at the same time be traced to its origin.
The ganglion is so hemmed in by the bony walls of the fossa that it is very
difficult to display it thoroughly; but by removing the orbital process of the
SPHENO-PALATINE GANGLION
palate bone, and a portion of the body of the sphenoid, with the bone
forceps, it may be more or less satisfactorily exposed. In the same
restricted space will be found the terminal portion of the internal maxillary
artery, from which numerous branches are given off.
Ganglion Spheno-palatinum.—This is a small, triangular
flattened body, which is lodged in the pterygo palatine fossa.
It is embedded in soft fat, and is surrounded by the ter-
minal branches of the internal maxillary artery. Two stout
spheno - palatine branches descend from the maxillary nerve
and join it from above, but only certain of their fibres
are involved in the ganglion; the remainder are continued
directly into the nasal and palatine nerves which proceed
from the ganglion. The spheno-palatine branches may be
regarded as constituting the sensory roots of the ganglion.
From the spheno-palatine ganglion branches are given off
which radiate in four directions—viz., medially to the nose;
downwards to the palate; posteriorly to establish connections
with the facial nerve and carotid plexus, as well as to supply
the mucous membrane of the pharynx; and anteriorly to the
orbit.

Nerve of pterygoid canal.
Some lateral posterior superior nasal
branches.

From the internal maxillary artery twigs are given off
which accompany these nerves.
Posterior Superior Nasal Nerves.—There are two groups of
the posterior superior nasal nerves, a medial and a lateral.
The medial branches pass through the spheno - palatine
foramen and across the roof of the nasal cavity to the posterior
part of the septum. The largest of them, the naso-palatine
nerve, runs downwards and anteriorly in a groove on the
surface of the vomer (p. 392). Some of the branches of the
lateral posterior group also pass through the spheno-palatine
foramen and are distributed to the superior meatus, to the
superior and middle conchae, and to the posterior ethmoidal
air cells. Other branches of the lateral group pass posteriorly,
some in the muco-periosteum of the upper and posterior part
of the nasal cavity, and one in the pharyngeal canal (O.T.
II—26 as
HEAD AND NECK
pterygo-palatine or pharyngeal nerve). They are distributed
to the muco-periosteum of the posterior part of the roof of
the nasal cavity, to the adjacent parts of the wall of the
pharynx, to the sphenoidal air sinus, and to the pharyngeal
part of the auditory tube.
The descending branches are the palatine nerves, and with
them are incorporated the posterior inferior nasal nerves.
The palatine nerves are three in number, anterior (O.T. great
or posterior palatine), middle, and posterior. As a rule these
spring by a common trunk from the lower aspect of the
ganglion. The trunk descends in the pterygo-palatine canal,
which has been opened up already, but to expose the
nerves a dense fibrous investment must also be removed.
The nerve-trunk will then be seen breaking up into its con-
stituent parts.
Dissection.—Trace, in the first instance, the two smaller nerves—viz.,
the middle and posterior palatine branches. These leave the main canal
and enter the small palatine canals, which conduct them through the
pyramidal process of the palate bone. Before opening these up it is well
to secure the nerves as they emerge from the lower openings of the canals.
This can very readily be done, by dissecting posterior to the hamulus of
the medial pterygoid lamina and gently separating the soft parts from
the under aspect of the pyramid of the palate bone. As the dissection
is being made from the inside, the middle palatine nerve will be first en-
countered, and it will be seen to pass posteriorly into the soft palate,
under cover of the tendinous expansion of the tensor veli palatini.1 This
must be divided, in order that the nerve may be followed to its distribu-
tion. The posterior palatine nerve will be found issuing from its canal a
short distance to the lateral side of the preceding nerve. It is distributed
to the soft palate in the neighbourhood of the tonsil. It is smaller than
the middle palatine nerve, and is sometimes absent. The large anterior
palatine nerve should now be followed onwards to the hard palate. To
do this the lower part of the palatine canal must be opened up by removing
a small portion of the posterior and lateral part of the horizontal plate of
the palate bone.
The anterior palatine nerve is the largest branch of the
spheno-palatine ganglion. It descends through the pterygo-
palatine canal, accompanied by the great palatine branch of
the internal maxillary artery; it enters the palate through the
great palatine foramen and runs anteriorly, in a groove on the
lower aspect of the hard palate, towards the incisive foramen.
It supplies the gum, the mucous membrane, and the glands
of the vault of the mouth; and, in the neighbourhood of the
incisive foramen, it communicates with the naso-palatine

appearance of the tendon of the tensor palati, as it passes under the hamulus.
nerve. As it passes down the pterygo- palatine canal the
posterior inferior nasal branches, which were enclosed in
its sheath, leave it and enter the nasal cavity (p. 401).
In tracing the anterior palatine nerve in the palate,
the dissector should note the numerous glands which are
placed under the mucous membrane of the vault of the
mouth, and the manner in which these indent the bone.1
Dissection.—Considerable difficulty will be experienced in exposing the
nerves in the pharyngeal and pterygoid canals, which are very inaccessible.
To open up the pharyngeal canal the sphenoidal process of the
palate bone must be cautiously removed with the bone forceps, and then
the dissector should proceed to open up the pterygoid canal (O.T. Vidian),
which traverses the root of the pterygoid process. As the bone is very
hard and brittle at this point, the dissection must be effected very carefully.
The nerve of the pharyngeal canal belongs to the posterior
superior nasal group (p. 403).
Nervus Canalis Pterygoidei (O.T. Vidian). —. The nerve
of the pterygoid canal is formed by a junction between the
great superficial petrosal branch of the facial and the great
deep petrosal branch of the carotid plexus. It traverses the
pterygoid canal, and joins the posterior aspect of the spheno-
palatine ganglion, of which it may be considered to repre-
sent both the motor and sympathetic root. In the canal it
is invested by a strong fibrous envelope, and when this is
removed it may sometimes be noticed to break up into a
fine plexus which surrounds the accompanying artery. It
has already been seen to give some fine filaments to the
muco-periosteum of the nose.
The Rami Orbitales.—The orbital branches of the ganglion
are exceedingly minute; they pass anteriorly through the
inferior orbital fissure to supply the periosteum of the orbit.
Termination of Internal Maxillary Artery.—The internal
maxillary artery breaks up into its terminal branches in the
pterygo-palatine fossa. They are—.
1. Posterior superior alveolar (p. 271).
2. The infra-orbital (p. 388).
3. The descending palatine.
4. The spheno-palatine.
The Descending Palatine Artery.—The descending palatine

forceps, and then to display the nerve and artery on the upper surfaces of
the mucous membrane and glands.
HEAD AND NECK
artery is a terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery.
As it descends in the pterygo-palatine fossa it gives off, usually,
the artery of the pterygoid canal, and as it enters the pterygo-
palatine canal several small palatine arteries spring from it;
then it becomes the great palatine artery. The great palatine
artery descends through the great palatine foramen into the
hard palate; there it runs anteriorly to reach the incisive
foramen, through which it passes into the nasal cavity to
anastomose with the posterior artery of the septum, which is
an offset of the spheno-palatine artery.
The small palatine arteries, which spring from the descend-
ing palatine, immediately before it becomes the great palatine
artery, in the upper part of the pterygo-palatine canal; they
descend through the small palatine canals, and are distributed
to the soft palate, the palatine arches, and to the tonsil.
The Spheno-palatine Artery.—The spheno-palatine artery
enters the nasal cavity through the spheno-palatine foramen.
It gives off (1) a branch to the sphenoidal air sinus, (2) a
branch which passes posteriorly to the upper part of the
pharynx through the pharyngeal canal (O.T. pterygo-palatine
artery) to be distributed to the roof of the posterior part of
the nasal cavity and to the roof of the pharynx; this branch
anastomoses with the ascending pharyngeal artery. Then the
spheno-palatine artery divides into lateral and septal posterior
nasal branches. The lateral branches are distributed to the
lateral wall of the nasal cavity, where they anastomose with
the branches of the posterior and anterior ethmoidal arteries,
and with the lateral nasal branch of the external maxillary.
They supply not only the muco-periosteum of the lateral
wall of the nasal cavity, but also the muco-periosteum of
the air sinuses which open into the cavity. The posterior
septal branch of the spheno-palatine artery accompanies the
posterior nasal septal nerve along the surface of the vomer;
it anastomoses with the great palatine artery, and with the
septal branch of the superior labial artery.
THE LARYNX.
The lateral portions of the mandible, which are still
attached by mucous membrane to the sides of the tongue,
should be removed, and the dissection of the larynx com-
menced.
407
General Construction and Position.—The larynx con-
stitutes the upper expanded portion of the air-passage which is
specially modified for the production of the voice. Its walls
are composed of cartilages, muscles, ligaments, and an in-
ternal lining of mucous membrane. Before proceeding with
the dissection the student should study the form and con-
nections of the nine laryngeal cartilages in a permanent speci-
men (v. p. 422).
The larynx is placed in the upper and anterior part of
the neck, where it forms a marked projection. It lies below
the hyoid bone and tongue, and is directly continuous with
the trachea inferiorly. Anteriorly it is covered by the
integument and fascia?, and, on either side of the median
plane, by two thin strata of muscles—viz., the sterno-hyoid and
omo-hyoid; the sterno-thyreoid and the thyreo-hyoid. As a
general rule a narrow process of the thyreoid gland, termed
the pyramidal lobe, is also continued upwards on its anterior
surface. On each side the lateral lobe of the thyreoid gland is
prolonged upwards upon it; and it is related to the great
vessels of the neck. Posteriorly it is in relation to the pharynx,
which separates it from the prevertebral muscles. If the
tip of the epiglottis is taken as its upper limit, the larynx in
the adult may be regarded as being placed anterior to that
portion of the vertebral column which extends from the lower
border of the second to the lower border of the sixth cervical
vertebra; but its position alters somewhat with the movements
of the head and also during deglutition.
Interior of the Larynx.—The cavity of the larynx is
smaller than might be expected from an inspection of its
exterior. On looking into its interior from above it will be
seen to be subdivided into three portions by two elevated
folds of mucous membrane which extend antero-posteriorly,
and project inwards from each side of the cavity. The upper
folds are termed the plica ventriculares (O.T. false vocal cords);
the lower pair receive the name of the plica vocales (O.T.
true vocal cords). The latter are the chief agents in the
production of the voice, and the larynx is so constructed
that changes in their relative position and in their degree of
tension are brought about by the action of the muscles and
the recoil of the elastic ligaments.
Vestibulum Laryngis.—The vestibule is the upper sub-
division of the laryngeal cavity (Fig. 150); it extends from the
HEAD AND NECK
superior aperture (aditus laryngis) of the larynx down to the
plicae ventriculares. In its lower part it exhibits a marked
lateral compression. Its width, therefore, diminishes from
above downwards, whilst owing to the obliquity of the aditus
the anterior wall is longer than the posterior. Anteriorly it
is bounded by the posterior surface of the epiglottis and the
thyreo-epiglottic ligament, both covered with mucous mem-
anterior elevation is formed by the cuneiform cartilage and
a mass of glands associated with it, enclosed within the
ary-epiglottic fold; the posterior elevation is due to the
anterior margin of the arytenoid cartilage and the cor-
niculate cartilage. A shallow groove descends between these
rounded elevations and terminates below by running into the
interval between the ventricular and the vocal folds. The
posterior wall of the vestibule is narrow, and corresponds to the
interval between the upper parts of the two arytenoid cartilages.

The aditus laryngis has already been examined in the
dissection of the pharynx (p. 378). The parts which bound
it should again be carefully studied.
The epiglottis projects upwards posterior to the root of the
tongue. Its lingual or anterior surface is free in the upper
part of its extent only, and is attached to the pharyngeal
part of the tongue by a prominent median fold of mucous
membrane, termed the glosso-epiglottic fold. Two lateral folds
are also present; they connect its margins with the lateral
walls of the pharynx at the side of the tongue and are
called the pharyngo-epiglotticfolds. Between the two layers of
mucous membrane which constitute each of these three folds,
there is a small amount of elastic tissue. The depression on
each side between the tongue and the epiglottis which is
bounded by the glosso-epiglottic and the pharyngo-epiglottic
folds is termed the vallecula (Fig. 150). The posterior free
surface of the epiglottis forms the greater part of the anterior
boundary of the vestibule of the larynx. The upper part of
this surface is convex, owing to the manner in which the
upper margin is curved towards the tongue; below this
convexity there is a slight concavity, and still lower a marked
bulging over the upper part of the thyreo-epiglottic ligament.
This last projection is called the tubercle of the epiglottis; it
forms a conspicuous object in laryngoscopic examinations of
the larynx.
The ary-epiglottic folds of mucous membrane enclose
between their two layers some connective tissue, the ary-
epiglottic muscles, and, posteriorly, the cuneiform and the
corniculate cartilages, which surmount the arytenoid cartilages.
As already mentioned, these small nodules of cartilage raise
the posterior part of the ary-epiglottic fold in the form of
two rounded eminences or tubercles which are easily seen
when the larynx is examined by the laryngoscope.
The Middle Subdivision of the Laryngeal Cavity (Fig. 157)
is the smallest of the three. Above it is bounded by the
ventricular folds, below by the vocal folds; it communicates
with the vestibule above and the inferior compartment of the
larynx below.
Plica Ventriculares (O.T. false vocal cords).—The ventricular
folds are two prominent mucous folds which extend antero-
posteriorly on the lateral walls of the laryngeal cavity. They
are soft and somewhat flaccid, and their free borders are
HEAD AND NECK
slightly arched, with the concavities looking downwards.
Within each fold are contained—(1) a ligamentum ventriculare;
(2) numerous glands which are chiefly aggregated in its middle
part; and (3) a few muscle fibres. The interval between the
ventricular folds is termed the rima vestibuli; it is consider-
ably wider than that between the vocal folds. It follows,
therefore, that the four folds are distinctively visible when
the cavity of the larynx is examined from above, but when
examined from below, the vocal folds alone can be seen.
Plica Vocales (O.T. True vocal cords).—The vocal folds are
placed below the ventricular folds, and extend from the angle
between the laminae of the thyreoid cartilage, anteriorly, to the

vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages posteriorly. Each
vocal fold is sharp and prominent, and its mucous membrane is
thin and is firmly bound down to the subjacent vocal ligament.
In colour it is pale, almost pearly white, whilst posteriorly
the point of the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage,
which stands out in relief, presents a yellowish tinge. In
frontal section each vocal fold is somewhat prismatic in form,
and the free border looks upwards and medially (Fig. 157).
The vocal folds are the agents by means of which the voice
is produced. The ventricular folds are of little importance
in this respect; indeed, they can in great part be destroyed
without any appreciable difference in the voice resulting.
The rima glottidis is the elongated fissure by means of
which the middle compartment of the larynx communicates
with the lower subdivision. It is placed somewhat below
411
the middle of the laryngeal cavity, of which it constitutes
the narrowest part. Anteriorly it corresponds to the interval
between the vocal folds; posteriorly it corresponds to the
interval between the bases and vocal processes of the ary-
tenoid cartilages (Fig. 160). It is composed, therefore, of
two very distinct parts—(1) a narrow anterior portion, be-
tween the vocal folds, involving less than two-thirds of its
length, and called
the pars inter- ( /Hyoid bone
L . \\/ Hyo-epiglottic ligament
membranacea; (2) a
broader, shorter por-
tion, between the
arytaenoid cartilages,
termed the pars in-
tercartilaginea. The
form of the rima
glottidis undergoes
frequent alterations
in the living person.
During ordinary
quiet respiration it is
lanceolate in outline,
and the intermem-
branous part has
the form of an elon-
gated triangle with
the base directed
posteriorly. When
the glottis is widely
opened the broadest
part of the fissure
lies between the ex-
tremities of the vocal
processes of the arytaenoid cartilages, and there each side
of the rima presents a marked angle. The two vocal folds,
on the other hand, may be approximated so closely to each
other, as in singing a high note, that the intermembranous
part is reduced to a linear chink. The length of the entire
fissure differs considerably in the two sexes. In the male
its average length is 23 mm.; in the female, 17 mm.
The lateral wall of the larynx, in the interval between the
ventricular and the vocal folds, shows a pocket-like depression

or recess, termed the ventriculus laryngis (O.T. laryngeal
sinus). The dissector should endeavour to gauge the
extent of this, by means of a probe bent at the extremity.
The recess passes upwards, undermining the ventricular fold,
and its mouth or orifice is narrower than its cavity. Under
cover of the anterior part of the ventricular fold a slit-like
aperture will be detected. This leads into the appendix
ventriculi (O.T. laryngeal saccule), a small diverticulum, which
ascends between the ventricular fold and the lamina of

the thyreoid cartilage. This sac is of variable extent, but
as a rule it ends blindly at the level of the upper border of
the thyreoid cartilage.
Distend the ventricle, and, if possible, the appendix, with cotton
wadding. This will greatly facilitate the subsequent dissection.
The Lowest Subdivision of the Laryngeal Cavity (Fig. 157)
leads directly downwards into the trachea. Above, it is
narrow and laterally compressed, but it gradually widens out
until in its lowest part it is circular. It is bounded by the
sloping inner surface of the conus elasticus, and by the inner
413
aspect of the cricoid cartilage. It is through the anterior wall
of this compartment that the opening is made in the operation
of laryngotomy.
Mucous Membrane of the Larynx.—This is continuous
above with that lining the pharynx, and below with the
mucous lining of the trachea. Over the laryngeal or posterior
surface of the epiglottis it is closely adherent, but elsewhere,
above the level of the vocal folds, it is loosely attached by
submucous tissue. As it passes over the vocal folds it is very
thin and tightly bound down, and in inflammatory conditions
of the larynx, attended by oedema, this attachment usually
prevents the infiltration of the submucous tissue from extend-
ing downwards below the rima glottidis.
The mucous membrane of the larynx has a plentiful supply
of racemose glands which secrete mucus. Over the surface
of the vocal folds these are completely absent.
Dissection.—Place the larynx upon a block so that its anterior surface
looks upwards, and fix it in that position with pins. The branches which
the external laryngeal nerve gives to the crico-thyreoid muscle should in the
first place be followed out; and, carefully preserving the superior and inferior
laryngeal vessels and the internal and inferior laryngeal nerves, the dis-
sector should in the next place proceed to remove the thyreoid gland, and
the omo-hyoid, sterno - hyoid, sterno-thyreoid, and thyreo-hyoid muscles.
The fibres of origin of the inferior constrictor muscle also should be
cleared away from the thyreoid and cricoid cartilages. The broad thyreo-
hyoid membrane, the crico-thyreoid ligament, and the crico-thyreoid
muscles are now exposed, and their attachments may be defined.
Membrana Hyo-thyreoidea.—This is a broad membranous
sheet, which occupies the interval between the hyoid bone
and the thyreoid cartilage. It is not equally strong throughout,
but shows a central thick portion, the median thyreo-hyoid
ligament, largely composed of elastic fibres, and cord-like
right and left margins, the lateral thyreo-hyoid ligaments,
whilst in the intervals between the central part and the
lateral margins it is thin and weak. The median ligament is
attached above to the posterior aspect of the upper margin of
the body of the hyoid bone; below, it is fixed to the sides of
the deep median notch which interrupts the superior border of
the thyreoid cartilage. The upper part of its anterior surface is,
therefore, placed posterior to the posterior hollowed-out surface
of the body of the hyoid bone; a mucous bursa is interposed
between them, and in certain movements of the head and
larynx the upper border of the thyreoid cartilage is allowed
to slip upwards posterior to the hyoid bone. On each side of
HEAD AND NECK
the strong central part the thyreo-hyoid membrane is attached
below to the upper margin of the lamina of the thyreoid
cartilage, and above to the deep aspect of the great cornu of
the hyoid bone. It is pierced by the internal laryngeal nerve
and superior laryngeal vessels. The lateral thyreo-hyoid
ligament, which forms the posterior border of the membrane,
on each side, is rounded and cord-like, and is composed chiefly
of elastic fibres. It extends from the tip of the great cornu
of the hyoid bone to the extremity of superior cornu of the
thyreoid cartilage. In this ligament there is usually developed
a small oval cartilaginous

or bony nodule, which is
termed the cartilago triticea.
Musculus Crico-
thyreoideus. — The crico-
thyreoid muscle is placed
on the side of the cricoid
cartilage, and bridges over
the lateral portion of the
crico - thyreoid interval.
Taking origin from the
lower border and outer
surface of the arch of
the cricoid cartilage, its
fibres spread out in an
upward and posterior
direction, and are inserted
F1g. 161.—The Crico-thyreoid Muscle. intO the inner aspect of
the lower margin of the
thyreoid lamina, and also into the anterior border of its
inferior cornu. As a general rule, it is divided into two parts.
The anterior or oblique part is composed of those fibres which
are attached to the lamina of the thyreoid cartilage; the
posterior or straight part is formed of those fibres which are
inserted into the inferior cornu of the thyreoid cartilage. It
is closely associated with the inferior constrictor muscle. The
crico-thyreoid muscle is supplied by the external laryngeal
branch of the superior laryngeal nerve.
Conus Elasticus.—Extending upwards, from the upper
border of the anterior and lateral parts of the cricoid cartilage
to the thyreoid and arytenoid cartilages, is a strong elastic
membrane, the conus elasticus, which is separable into a
415
median and two lateral parts. The median part is the crico-
thyroid ligament which extends from the upper border of the
anterior part of the cricoid arch to the lower border of the
thyreoid cartilage. Each lateral part (O.T. lateral part of
crico-thyreoid membrane) runs upwards and medially and
terminates in a free thickened border, the ligamentum. vocale,
which lies in the substance of the plica vocalis - and is
attached posteriorly to the vocal process of arytaenoid, and
anteriorly to the angle of union of the two laminae of the
thyreoid cartilage. The inner surface of the conus elasticus
is covered with the mucous membrane of the lowest section of
the cavity of the larynx, and the outer surface is in relation
with the lateral crico-arytaenoid and the vocalis muscles.
Dissection.—The position of the larynx must now be reversed. Fix
it upon the block in such a manner that its posterior aspect is directed
upwards. The oesophagus should then be slit open by a median incision
through its posterior wall. Next remove the mucous membrane which
covers the posterior aspect of the cricoid and arytaenoid cartilages. In
doing this, bear in mind that the inferior laryngeal artery and the inferior
laryngeal nerve pass upwards, between the thyreoid and cricoid cartilages,
and must be preserved.
Upon the posterior aspect of the broad lamina of the cricoid cartilage
the dissector will now note the two posterior crico-arytaenoid muscles, and
the attachment of the tendinous band through which the longitudinal fibres
of the oesophagus are fixed to the cricoid cartilage. The band takes origin
from the prominent median ridge on the posterior aspect of the cricoid
cartilage. On the posterior surface of the arytaenoid cartilages, and bridg-
ing across the interval between them, are the transverse and oblique parts
of the arytaenoid muscle. Especial care must be taken in cleaning this
muscle in order that the connections of the superficial decussating fibres
may be ascertained fully.
The lateral layer of the right ary-epiglottic fold of mucous membrane
should now be cautiously removed. This will expose the ary-epiglottic
muscle, the cuneiform cartilage, and the corniculate cartilage of that side.
This is perhaps the most difficult part of the dissection, because the
dissector has to establish the continuity of the sparse fibres, which com-
pose the pale ary-epiglottic muscle, with the decussating fibres of the
arytenoid muscle.
Musculus Crico-Arytaenoideus Posterior.—The posterior
crico-arytaenoid muscle is somewhat fan-shaped (Fig. 162).
It springs by a broad origin from the depression which marks
the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, on each side of
the median ridge, and its fibres converge to be inserted into
the posterior surface of the muscular process or projecting
lateral angle of the base of the arytaenoid cartilage.
In pursuing this upward and lateral course, the fibres run with different
degrees of obliquity. The uppermost fibres are short and nearly horizontal;
HEAD AND NECK
the intermediate fibres are the longest, and are very oblique; whilst the
lowest fibres are almost vertical in their direction.
Musculus Arytaenoideus.—The arytenoid muscle consists
of two portions—a superficial part, termed the arytanoideus
obliquus, and a deeper layer, called the arytanoideus iransversus.
The arytanoideus obliquus is composed of two bundles of
muscular fibres, each of which springs from the posterior aspect
of the muscular process of the corresponding arytsenoid

cartilage (Fig. 162). From these points the two fleshy slips
proceed upwards and medially, and cross each other in the
median plane like the limbs of the letter X. Reaching the
summit of the arytaenoid cartilage of the opposite side, some
of the f1bres are inserted into it, but the greater proportion
are prolonged, round the base of the corniculate cartilage,
into the ary-epiglottic fold. There they receive the
name of the ary-epiglotticus muscle, and as they approach
the epiglottis they are joined by the f1bres of the thyreo-
epiglotticus muscle. The oblique arytaenoid muscles may
be considered as constituting a weak sphincter muscle

for the superior aperture of the larynx. Each bundle
starting from the base of one of the arytenoid cartilages
is prolonged into the ary-epiglottic fold of the opposite
side, and along this to the margin of the epiglottis.
The arytanoideus transversus is an unpaired muscle. It is
composed of transverse fibres which bridge across the interval
between the two arytaenoid cartilages, and are attached to
the posterior aspect of the lateral border of each arytenoid
cartilage. Many of the fibres turn round the arytaenoid

cartilage and become continuous, on each side, with the fibres
of the thyreo-arytaenoid muscle.
Dissection.—The further dissection of the laryngeal muscles should be
confined to the right side of the larynx. The left side should be reserved
for the study of the nerves and vessels. Place the larynx on its left side,
and, having fixed it in this position, remove the right crico-thyreoid muscle.
The right lateral part of the thyreo-hyoid membrane should next be divided,
and the right inferior cornu of the thyreoid cartilage disarticulated from its
facet on the side of the cricoid cartilage. An incision should now be made
through the right lamina of the thyreoid cartilage, a short distance to the

HEAD AND NECK
right side of the median plane, and the detached piece must be carefully
removed. Three muscles are now exposed, and must be cleaned.
They are named from below upwards :—
1. The lateral crico-arytacnoid.
2. The thyreo-arytaenoid.
3. The thyreo-epiglotticus.
Musculus Cricoarytaenoideus Lateralis.-—The lateral crico-
arytenoid muscle is triangular in form, and smaller than the
posterior crico-arytaenoid (Fig. 163). It springs from the
upper border of the lateral part of the cricoid cartilage, ex-
tending to the facet on the lamina which supports the base of
the arytaenoid cartilage; a few of its f1bres take origin from
the conus elasticus also. From this attachment its fibres run
posteriorly and upwards, and converge to be inserted into the
anterior surface of the processus muscularis of the arytaenoid
cartilage. The superficial or lateral surface of this muscle is
covered by the lamina of the thyreoid cartilage and the upper
part of the crico-thyreoid muscle; its deep surface is applied
to the conus elasticus.
Musculus Vocalis.—The musculus vocalis is a sheet of
muscular fibres which springs, anteriorly, from the angle of
union of the two laminae of the thyreoid cartilage. It runs
posteriorly, along the ligamentum vocale and the upper part
of the conus elasticus, and is inserted into the lateral surface
of the body and the anterior surface of the muscular process
of the arytaenoid cartilage. Its lower f1bres blend with the
upper margin of the lateral crico-arytaenoid muscle and the
medial f1bres, which run along and to a certain extent are
attached to the ligamentum vocale,1 form a bundle, triangular
in frontal section, to which the term internal thyro-arytaenoid
muscle was formerly applied. The vocalis muscle protracts
the arytaenoid cartilage, and adducts and relaxes the vocal
ligaments.
Musculus Thyreoepiglotticus. — The thyreo - epiglottic
muscle springs from the thyreoid cartilage, immediately above
the musculus vocalis, with the upper border of which it is more
or less blended. Its fibres run posteriorly and upwards, into
the ary-epiglottic fold, where they blend with the ary-epiglot-
ticus, and they are inserted into the lateral border of the
lower half of the epiglottis.
1 The fibres which are attached to the ligamentum vocale are called
collectively the ary-vocalis muscle.
419
Musculus Thyreoarytaenoideus (O.T. Thyro-arytenoideus
Externus).—This muscle also springs from the angle of union
of the two laminae of the thyreoid cartilage, in close associa-
tion with the vocalis. Its fibres pass posteriorly, and are
inserted into the lateral surface of the arytaenoid cartilage.
It protracts the arytaenoid cartilage, and adducts and relaxes
the vocal fold.

F1g. 164.—Frontal section of Larynx showing Muscles.
Dissection.—The lateral crico-arytaenoid muscle should now be carefully
removed, and at the same time the dissector should endeavour to disengage
the fibres of the thyreo - arytaenoideus from the deeper musculus vocalis,
in order that the relation of the latter to the vocal ligament may be
studied. Finally remove the musculus vocalis. This will display the outer
surface of the conus elasticus, the vocal ligament, and the wall of the laryn-
geal ventricle. By carefully dissecting between the two layers of mucous
membrane which form the ventricular fold, the weak ventricular ligament,
which gives it support, may be discovered, as well as a number of racemose
glands which lie in relation to it.
Ligamentum Vocale. — This ligament is the thickened
free border of the lateral part of the conus elasticus, and it
constitutes the support of the vocal fold. It is attached,
anteriorly, close to its fellow of the opposite side, to the
middle of the angular depression between the two laminae of

the thyreoid cartilage. From this it stretches posteriorly to
its attachment to the tip and upper border of the processus

cartilage. The vocal ligament is composed of yellow elastic
fibres. Its medial border is sharp and free and is clothed
with mucous membrane, which in this position is thin and
firmly bound down to the ligament. Embedded in its anterior
extremity there is a minute nodule of condensed elastic tissue,
called the sesamoid
cartilage.

the medial surface of the arytaenoid cartilage (p. 160). These
parts are clothed with the lining mucous membrane of the
larynx.
Ligamentum Ventriculare.—This feeble band supports the
ventricular fold. It is weak and indefinite, but somewhat
longer than the vocal ligament. Anteriorly, it is attached to
the angular depression between the two laminae of the thyreoid
cartilage, above the vocal fold and immediately below the
attachment of the thyreo-epiglottic ligament; and it extends
posteriorly to a tubercle on the lateral surface of the arytenoid
cartilage above the processus vocalis. It is composed of con-
nective tissue and elastic fibres, which are continuous with the
fibrous tissue in the ary-epiglottic fold.

Dissection.—Remove the remains of the ary-epiglottic fold, the ventricular
and the vocal folds, and the lateral part of the conus elasticus on the
right side of the larynx, but be careful not to injure the arytenoid cartilage
or the corniculate cartilage. Should the cuneiform cartilage be present
in the ary-epiglottic fold it should be detached and preserved. By this
dissection a closer view of the side wall of the laryngeal cavity can be ob-
tained. The undissected vocal fold of the left side should be examined
again, the laryngeal ventricle and appendix explored, and their precise
connections and extent determined. When the dissector has satisfied
himself upon these points he can proceed to display the vessels and nerves
of the larynx. The superior laryngeal artery and the internal laryngeal
nerve reach the pharynx by piercing the lateral thin part of the thyreo-hyoid
membrane, and they descend along the lateral wall of the recessus piriformis
to the larynx. By applying traction to the nerve, and at the same
time dividing the mucous membrane upon the medial surface of the thyreo-
hyoid membrane, they can easily be discovered. In following the branches
into which they divide, the mucous membrane must be gradually removed
from the wall of the larynx. The inferior laryngeal artery and nerve enter
from below and proceed upwards, under cover of the lamina of the
thyreoid cartilage. They can be satisfactorily displayed only by the
removal of this piece of cartilage, but the dissector is not recommended
to adopt this method unless another larynx is available for the examination
of the cartilages and joints. By drawing the thyreoid cartilage laterally
the more important branches can be studied.
Ramus Internus of the Nervus Laryngeus Superior.—
In the dissection of the neck the internal laryngeal nerve was
seen springing from the superior laryngeal branch of the
vagus. It is a sensory nerve, and its branches are distributed
chiefly to the mucous membrane of the larynx. After pierc-
ing the lateral part of the thyreo-hyoid membrane, it divides
into three branches. The uppermost of these sends filaments
to the ary-epiglottic fold, to the mucous membrane which
covers the epiglottis, and to the three folds anterior to it.
The twigs which go to the epiglottis ramify on its posterior
surface, but many of them pierce the cartilage to reach the
mucous membrane on its anterior surface. The intermediate
branch of the internal laryngeal nerve breaks up into filaments,
which are given to the mucous membrane lining the side wall
of the larynx. The lowest branch descends and gives filaments
to the mucous membrane which covers the lateral and
posterior aspects of the arytaenoid and cricoid cartilages. A
fairly large twig, which proceeds from this branch, runs down-
wards upon the posterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage to join
the laryngeal branch of the recurrent nerve.
Nervus Recurrens.—The recurrent nerve has previously
been seen arising from the vagus, and it has been traced, in
the neck, up to the point where it disappears under cover of
11—27 a
HEAD AND NECK
the lower border of the inferior constrictor muscle and becomes
the inferior laryngeal nerve, which ascends upon the lateral
aspect of the cricoid cartilage, immediately posterior to the
crico-thyreoid joint. There it is joined by the communicating
twig from the internal laryngeal nerve, and almost immediately
afterwards it divides into two branches. The larger oi the two
proceeds upwards, under cover of the lamina of the thyreoid
cartilage, and breaks up into filaments which supply the lateral
crico-arytaenoid, the thyreo-arytsenoid, the vocalis and the
thyreo-epiglottic muscles; the smaller or posterior branch inclines
upwards and posteriorly, upon the posterior aspect of the
cricoid cartilage, and under cover of the posterior crico-
arytaenoid muscle. It supplies twigs to that muscle, and is
then continued onwards to end in the arytaenoid muscles.
The inferior laryngeal nerve is, therefore, the motor nerve
of the larynx. It supplies all the muscles with the exception
of the crico-thyreoid, which obtains its nerve-supply from the
external laryngeal. The inferior laryngeal nerve, however,
contains a few sensory fibres also. These it gives to the
mucous membrane of the larynx below the rima glottidis.
Laryngeal Arteries. — The superior laryngeal artery, a
branch of the superior thyreoid, accompanies the internal
laryngeal nerve; the inferior laryngeal artery, which springs
from the inferior thyreoid, accompanies the inferior laryngeal
nerve. These two vessels ramify in the laryngeal wall and
supply the mucous membrane, glands, and muscles.
Laryngeal Cartilages and Joints.—The cartilages which
constitute the skeleton of the larynx and give support to its
wall are the following :—
They are connected by certain ligaments.
Dissection. — The mucous membrane and muscles must be carefully
removed from the cartilages, and the ligaments must be defined. Great
caution must be exercised in cleaning the arytenoid cartilages and the
corniculate cartilages, in order that the latter may not be injured.
Oartilago Epiglottica.—The epiglottic cartilage is a thin,
leaf-like lamina of yellow fibro-cartilage which is placed posterior
to the tongue and the body of the hyoid bone, anterior to
the upper aperture of the larynx. When divested of the

mucous membrane which covers it posteriorly and also, to
some extent, anteriorly, the epiglottic cartilage has the form
of an obovate leaf and is indented by pits and pierced by
numerous perforations. In the pits glands are lodged, and
through the foramina vessels and, in some cases, nerves
pass. The broad end of the cartilage is directed upwards
and is free; its margins are to a large extent enclosed within
the ary-epiglottic folds. The anterior surface is free only in
its upper part. This part is covered with mucous membrane
and looks towards the base of the tongue. The posterior
surface is covered throughout its whole extent with the
mucous membrane of the larynx. The pointed lower end
of the cartilage, the petiolus, is connected by a stout fibrous
band, termed the thyreo-epiglottic ligament, to the angle
between the laminae of the thyreoid cartilage.
Epiglottic Ligaments. — The epiglottis is bound by
ligaments to the base of the tongue, to the side wall of the
pharynx, to the hyoid bone, and to the thyreoid cartilage.
The glosso-epiglottic fold and the two pharyngo-epiglottic folds
have been studied already. In each there is a small quantity
of elastic tissue. The hyo-epiglottic ligament is a short,
broad elastic band which connects the anterior face of the
epiglottis to the upper border of the body of the hyoid bone.
The thyreo-epiglottic ligament is strong, elastic, and thick. It
proceeds downwards, from the lower pointed extremity of the
epiglottis, and is attached to the angular depression between the
two laminae of the thyreoid cartilage, below the median notch.
The triangular interval which is left between the lower
part of the cartilage of the epiglottis and the median part of
the thyreo-hyoid membrane contains a pad of soft fat, and is
imperfectly closed above by the hyo-epiglottic ligament.
Cartilago Thyreoidea.—This is the largest of the laryngeal
cartilages. It is composed of two broad and somewhat quadri-
lateral plates, termed the lamina, which meet anteriorly at an
angle, and become fused along the median plane. Posteriorly,
the laminae diverge from each other and enclose a wide
angular space. The anterior borders of the laminae are fused
only in their lower parts. Above they are separated by a
deep, narrow V-shaped notch called the incisura thyreoidea
superior. In the adult male the angle formed by the meeting
of the anterior borders of the two laminae, especially in the
upper part, is very projecting; and, with the margins of the
HEAD AND NECK
superior thyreoid notch, which lies above, it constitutes a marked
subcutaneous prominence in the neck, which receives the
name of the laryngeal prominence (O.T. pomum Adami). The
posterior border of each lamina is thick and rounded, and is
prolonged beyond the superior and inferior borders of the
lamina in the form of two slender cylindrical processes,
termed the cornua. The superior comu, longer than the

inferior cornu, gives attachment to the lateral thyreo-hyoid
ligament. The shorter, stronger inferior cornu curves slightly
medially. On the medial aspect of its tip there is a facet
which articulates with the side of the cricoid cartilage. The
superior border of the lamina is for the most part slightly
convex, and anteriorly it dips down to become continuous
with the margin of the superior thyreoid notch. The inferior
border is to all intents and purposes horizontal, but it is
divided by a projection, termed the inferior tubercle, into
425

a short posterior part and a longer anterior part. The outer
surface of the lamina is relatively flat. Immediately below
the posterior part of the upper border, and anterior to the root
of the superior cornu, there is a distinct prominence called the
superior tubercle. From this an oblique ridge descends towards
the inferior tubercle on the lower border of the lamina. This
ridge gives attachment to the sterno-thyreoid, thyreo-hyoid
and the inferior
constrictor muscles,
and divides the
outer surface of the
lamina into an
anterior and a pos-

latter, which is much
the smaller of the
two, is attached the

between the tip of the inferior cornu of the thyreoid car-
tilage and the side of the cricoid cartilage, belongs to the
diarthrodial variety. The opposed surfaces are surrounded
by a capsular ligament which is lined with a synovial stratum.
The movements which take place at these joints are of a
twofold character—viz., (1) gliding; (2) rotatory. In the
first case the cricoid facets glide upon the thyreoid surfaces in
different directions. The rotatory movement is one in which
the cricoid cartilage rotates around a transverse axis which
HEAD AND NECK
passes through the centre of the two joints. Each capsular
ligament is strengthened by stout bands on the posterior
aspect of the joint.
The thyreoid cartilage should now be removed by dividing the ligaments
which surround the crico-thyreoid joint.
Cartilago Cricoidea.—This is shaped like a signet ring.

F1g. 168.—Posterior aspect of Cartilages and Ligaments of Larynx.
The broad posterior part, the lamina, is somewhat quadrilateral
in form. Its superior border presents a faintly marked
median notch, and on each side of this there is an oval
convex facet which articulates with the base of the arytaenoid
cartilage. The posterior surface of the lamina is divided, by
an elevated median ridge, into two slightly hollowed-out
areas which give attachment to the posterior crico-arytaenoid
muscles. The median ridge itself gives origin to a tendinous
427
band which proceeds upwards from the longitudinal fibres of
the oesophagus. The anterior part of the cricoid cartilage
is the arch. The lower border of this is horizontal, and is
connected to the first tracheal ring by membrane, the crico-
tracheal ligament. The arch is narrow anteriorly, and is
attached to the lower border of the thyreoid cartilage by
the crico-thyreoid ligament. Posteriorly, the upper border
rapidly ascends. Upon the posterior part of the lateral
surface of the cricoid cartilage there is a circular, slightly
elevated, convex facet, which looks laterally and upwards, for
articulation with the inferior cornu of the thyreoid cartilage.
Internally the cricoid cartilage is lined with mucous membrane,
and its lumen is circular below, but elliptical above.
The narrow band-like part of the anterior arch of the
cricoid cartilage lies below the lower border of the thyreoid
cartilage, whilst the lamina is received into the interval
between the posterior portions of the laminae of the
thyreoid cartilage.
Cartilagines Corniculata?.—Before proceeding to the study
of the arytenoid cartilages the dissector should examine the
corniculate cartilages, and the manner in which they are
held in position. They are two minute pyramidal nodules
of yellow elastic cartilage which are placed on the summits
of the arytenoid cartilages, and are directed posteriorly and
medially. Each corniculate cartilage is enclosed within the
corresponding ary-epiglottic fold of mucous membrane, and
is joined to the apex of the arytenoid cartilage by a
synchondrodial joint.
Cartilagines Arytaenoideae.—In dealing with the arytaenoid
cartilages it is well to remove one in order that its external
form may be studied; the other should be retained in
position, for the purpose of examining the crico-arytaenoid
joint and the movements which can be performed at that
articulation.
The arytanoid cartilages are pyramidal in form, and sur-
mount the upper border of the lamina of the cricoid
cartilage. The apex of each is directed upwards, and is
curved postero-medially. It supports the corniculate cartilage.
Of the three surfaces, one looks medially, towards the corre-
sponding surface of the opposite cartilage, from which it is
separated by a narrow interval; another looks posteriorly;
whilst the third is directed antero-laterally. The medial
HEAD AND NECK
surface is narrow, vertical, and even, and is clothed with
mucous membrane. The posterior surface is concave; it
lodges and gives attachment to the arytaanoideus transversus
muscle. The antero-lateral surface is the most extensive of
the three, and is uneven for muscular and ligamentous attach-
ments. Upon this aspect of the arytaenoid cartilage the
musculus vocalis and the thyreo-arytsenoid muscles are in-
serted. The surfaces of the arytenoid cartilage are separated
by three borders, viz., an anterior, a posterior, and a lateral.
The lateral border is the longest, and, at the base of the
cartilage, it is prolonged postero-laterally in the form of a
stout prominent angle or process, termed the processus muscu-
laris. It gives attachment anteriorly to the crico-arytaenoideus
lateralis muscle; and posteriorly to the crico-arytaenoideus
posterior. The anterior border of the arytenoid cartilage is
prolonged into the projecting anterior angle of the base.
This is called the processus vocalis. It is sharp and pointed,
and gives attachment to the vocal ligament (O.T. true vocal
cord). The base of the arytenoid cartilage presents an
elongated concave facet, on its under aspect, for articulation
with the upper border of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage.
Crico arytaenoid Joints.—These articulations are of the
diarthrodial variety. There is a distinct joint cavity sur-
rounded by a capsular ligament, which is lined with a synovial
stratum. The cricoid articular surface is convex, that of
the arytenoid concave; both are elongated in form, but they
are placed in relation to each other so that the long axis of
the one intersects or crosses that of the other, and in no
position of the joint do the two surfaces accurately coincide.
The movements allowed at this joint, as the dissector can
readily determine, are of a twofold kind—(1) gliding, by
which the arytenoid is carried medially or laterally, or, in
other words, a movement by which the arytenoid advances
towards or retreats from its fellow; (2) rotatory, by which the
arytenoid cartilage revolves round a vertical axis. By this
movement the vocal process is swung laterally or medially, so
as to open or close the rima glottidis.
The dissector should note that the capsule of this joint
is strengthened posteriorly by a strong band which plays a
most important part in the mechanism of the articulation.
It restricts movement of the arytaenoid cartilage.
Cartilagines Cuneiformes.—These are two little rod-shaped

429
nodules of yellow elastic cartilage, which are placed one in
each ary-epiglottic fold near its posterior end. They are not
always present.
Action of the Laryngeal Muscles. —The dissector should now consider
the manner in which the muscles of the larynx operate upon the vocal
ligaments in the production of the voice. Tension of the vocal cords is pro-
duced by the contraction of the crico-thyreoid muscles. The oblique parts
of the muscles pull the upper border of the cricoid cartilage upwards,
whilst the straight portions, through their insertions into the inferior cornua,
draw the cricoid cartilage posteriorly, thereby increasing the distance
between the angle of the thyreoid cartilage and the vocal processes of the
arytenoid cartilages. When the crico-thyreoid muscles cease to contract,
the relaxation of the cords is brought about by the elasticity of the
ligaments. The vocalis and the thyreo-arytaenoideus must be regarded
as antagonistic to the crico-thyreoid muscles. When they contract they
approximate the angle of the thyreoid cartilage to the arytenoid cartilages,
and still further relax the cords, and when they cease to act, the elastic
ligaments of the larynx again bring about a state of equilibrium.
The width of the rima glottidis is regulated by the arytenoideus muscle,
which draws together the arytenoid cartilages. The lateral and posterior
crico-arytenoid muscles also modify the width of the rima glottidis. When
they act together they assist the arytenoid muscle in closing the glottis,
but when they act independently they are antagonistic muscles. Thus the
crico-arytanoidei posteriores, by drawing the muscular processes of the
arytenoid cartilages postero-laterally, swing the processus vocales and the
vocal folds laterally, and thus open the rima. The crico-aryticnoidei
laterales act in exactly the opposite manner. By drawing the muscular
processes in an opposite direction they close the rima.
But the muscles of the larynx have another function to perform besides
that of vocalisation. It was formerly thought that the superior aperture
of the larynx was closed, during deglutition, by the folding back of the
epiglottis; that in fact the epiglottis, during the passage of the bolus of
food, was applied like a lid over the entrance to the vestibule of the larynx.
The investigations of Prof. Anderson Stuart have shown that the superior
aperture of the larynx is closed during swallowing by the close apposition
and the forward projection of the two arytenoid cartilages, which are
forced against the tubercle of the epiglottis. The muscles chiefly concerned
in this movement are the thyreo-arytenoid muscles and the transverse
arytenoid muscle. These muscles form a true sphincter vestibuli. The
ary-epiglotticus muscle also assists in the closure.
THE TONGUE.
The tongue is a muscular organ placed on the floor of
the mouth. It has important duties to perform in connection
with the functions of mastication, deglutition, and articulation.
Moreover, the mucous membrane which covers it is specially
modified, in certain localities, in connection with the peripheral
terminations of the nerves of taste. The root of the tongue
is attached to the hyoid bone; the pointed anterior extremity
HEAD AND NECK
is free; the upper border of the base forms the lower boundary
of the isthmus faucium.
Mucous Membrane.—The lingual mucous membrane is
a part of the general mucous lining of the buccal cavity.
The dorsum of the tongue, when the mouth is closed and
the organ is at rest, is strongly arched antero-posteriorly,
and, for the most part, is moulded into the vaulted roof of
the mouth. The tongue consists of two developmentally
distinct parts, termed oral and pharyngeal. These are
marked off from each other, even in the adult, by a V-shaped
groove called the sulcus terminalis. The apex of this sulcus
points posteriorly, and coincides with a median blind pit
which receives the name of the foramen cacum. From this
the two limbs of the sulcus diverge antero-laterally, and they
reach the margins of the tongue at the attachments of the
glosso-palatine arches.
The oral part of the tongue, by its upper or dorsal
surface, stands in relation to the hard palate, and to some
extent to the anterior part of the soft palate also. The
pharyngeal part of the tongue looks posteriorly, and forms
the anterior wall of the oral portion of the pharynx. In its
upper part it is related to the soft palate, whilst below it is
intimately related to the epiglottis. On the lateral wall of the
pharynx, immediately above this portion of the tongue, is
the tonsil.
The mucous membrane which envelops the tongue
presents very different appearances in different localities.
That portion which is spread over the pharyngeal part of
the tongue, and is prolonged upwards over the surface of
the tonsil, is smooth and somewhat glossy and presents no
visible papilte. It is from this district that the glosso-
epiglottic fold takes origin, and every here and there the
surface is studded with low projections, which are produced
by lymph follicles placed subjacent to the mucous membrane.
Each of these small elevated areas, as a rule, presents in the
centre a minute pit, visible to the naked eye.
Anterior to the foramen caecum and sulcus terminalis the
mucous membrane which covers the dorsum, sides, and tip
of the oral part of the tongue is beset with papillae of
different kinds. As these are individually visible to the naked
eye the mucous membrane presents a very characteristic
appearance. Further, a median groove or sulcus extends
431
posteriorly from the tip of the tongue to the foramen caecum,
and divides the anterior two-thirds of the dorsum into two
halves.
On the under surface of the tongue the mucous mem-
brane is smooth and comparatively thin. In the median
plane it forms the frenulum lingua, which has been studied
at an earlier stage. On either side of the median line the
deep lingual vein may be noticed, in the living subject, ex-
tending anteriorly towards the tip. To the lateral side of this,

F1g. 169.—The Sublingual Region in the interior of the mouth.
and, therefore, somewhat nearer the border of the tongue, is a
delicate and feebly marked fold of mucous membrane, from
the free border of which a row of fringe-like processes or
fimbriae project. It is termed the plica fimbriata ; as it extends
anteriorly, towards the tip of the tongue, it inclines towards
the median plane. On the side of the tongue, immediately
anterior to the lingual attachment of the glosso-palatine
arches, five short vertical fissures in the mucous membrane,
separated by intervening folds, may be noticed. These are
the papilke foliata. They are the representatives of leaf-like
folds of the mucous membrane, which are much more highly
developed in certain of the lower animals (hare and rabbit),
HEAD AND NECK
and which are specially concerned in receiving the impressions
of taste.
Papillae Linguales.—These are of four kinds, and differ
in size, shape, and in the position they occupy on the
surface of the tongue. They are termed the vallate, the
fungiform, the conical, and the filiform.
Papilla Vallate.—The vallate papillae (O.T. circumvallate),
seven to twelve in number, are the largest, and are placed
immediately anterior to the sulcus terminalis, in two rows
which diverge from each other in an antero-lateral direction,
like the two limbs of the letter V. The foramen caecum
lies immediately posterior to the median vallate papilla, which
forms the apex of the V. In form, a vallate papilla is
broad and somewhat cylindrical, slightly narrower at its
attached than at its free extremity, and it is sunk in a pit.
It is thus surrounded by a deep trench, the outer wall of
which, termed the vallum, is slightly raised beyond the general
surface of the mucous membrane, and forms an annular eleva-
tion which encircles the free extremity or summit of the
papilla.
Papilla Fungiformes.—The fungiform papillae are much
smaller, but are present in much greater numbers. They are
found chiefly on the tip and sides of the tongue, but they are
scattered at irregular intervals over the dorsum also. Each
papilla presents a large, full, rounded, knob-like extremity,
while it is greatly constricted at the point where it springs
from the mucous surface. In the living tongue the fungiform
papillae are distinguished by their bright red colour.
Papilla Conica.—The conical papillae are present in very
large numbers. They are smaller than the fungiform variety,
and although they are quite visible to the naked eye they
can be more conveniently studied by the aid of an ordinary
pocket lens. They are minute conical projections which
taper towards their free extremities, and they occupy the
dorsum and sides of the tongue anterior to the sulcus
terminalis. They are arranged in parallel rows which are
placed close together, and in the posterior part of the dorsum
these diverge from the median sulcus in an antero-lateral
direction. Towards the tip of the tongue the rows of conical
papillae become more or less transverse in direction, and on
the sides of the tongue they are arranged perpendicularly.
Papilla Filiformes.—The filiform papillae are similar in
433
general characters to the conical papillae, but the epithelial
cap at the apex of the cone is broken up into thread-like
processes.
Muscles of the Tongue.—The tongue is composed almost
entirely of muscular fibres, with some adipose tissue inter-
mixed. It is divided into two lateral halves by a median
septum, and the muscles in connection with each of these

consist of an intrinsic and an extrinsic group. They are as
follows:—
( 1. Genioglossus.
I 2. Hyo-glossus.

I 5. Palato glossus.

'j 3. Vertical.
'4. Transverse.
The extrinsic muscles take origin from parts outside the
tongue, and thus are capable not only of giving rise to changes
in the form of the organ, but also of producing changes in
its position. The intrinsic muscles, which are placed entirely
within the substance of the tongue, are, for the most part,
capable of giving rise to alterations in its form only.
vol. 11—28
HEAD AND NECK
With the exception of the chondro-glossus, the extrinsic muscles have
been studied already, but the dissector should take this opportunity of
examining more fully their insertions, and the manner in which their fibres
are related to one another and to those of the intrinsic muscles. For this
purpose carefully reflect the mucous membrane from the right half of the
tongue, and follow the muscles into that side of the organ. At the same
time the lingual nerve and the profunda linguae artery should be preserved.
On the under surface of the tongue, near the tip, the removal of the mucous
membrane will expose a group of glands, aggregated together so as to form
a small oval mass on each side of the median plane. This is known as the
apical gland or the gland of Ntihn.
The styloglossus will be seen running along the side of
the tongue to the tip, where the muscles of opposite sides
become to a certain extent continuous. The hyo-glossus
extends upwards to the side of the tongue, and its fibres pass,
for the most part, under cover of those of the stylo-glossus to
reach the dorsum, over the posterior part of which they spread
out, beneath the mucous membrane. The genio-glossus sends
its fibres vertically upwards into the tongue on each side of
the median septum, and its insertion stretches from the tip
to the base. The fibres of the palato-glossus become con-
tinuous with those which form the stratum transversum.
The chondro-glossus is not always present. It is separated from the
deep surface of the hyo-glossus by the lingual vessels, and by the pharyn-
geal slip of the genio-glossus. It is a slender muscular band which takes
origin from the medial aspect of the root of the smaller cornu, and the
adjoining part of the body of the hyoid bone. Its fibres ascend, to enter
the tongue and finally spread out on the dorsum under cover of the
superior longitudinal muscle.
Musculus Longitudinalis Superior.—This is a continuous
layer of longitudinal fibres which covers the entire dorsum
linguae, from the root to the tip, immediately beneath the
mucous membrane. Towards the base of the tongue it is

thinner than in front, and there it is overlapped by the trans-
verse fibres of the hyo-glossus, and is intermixed with the
fibres of the chondro-glossus.
Musculi Longitudinales Inferiores. — The inferior longi-
tudinal muscles are two rounded fleshy bundles placed upon
the inferior aspect of the tongue, one on each side. Pos-
teriorly, each inferior longitudinal muscle lies in the interval
between the hyo-glossus and the genio - glossus, and is
attached to the hyoid bone; anteriorly, it is prolonged
to the apex of the tongue between the medial border of
the stylo-glossus and the genio-glossus; with the former it is
more or less blended.
Musculus Transversus Lingua.—The fibres of this muscle

(From Aeby.)
lie under the superior longitudinal fibres, and constitute a
thick layer which extends laterally from the lateral face of
the septum linguae, to the side of the tongue. The fibres
of the genio-glossus ascend through this transverse stratum
and break it up into numerous lamellae (Fig. 172). It is
joined by the fibres of the palato-glossus (Henle) (Fig. 171).
Musculus Verticalis Lingua.—The vertical fibres extend in
a curved direction from the dorsum to the under aspect of
the tongue, and decussate with the fibres of the transverse
muscle.
Nerves and Vessels of the Tongue.—The nerves of the
tongue are—(1) the glosso-pharyngeal; (2) the lingual; (3)
the hypoglossal; and (4) a few twigs from the internal
laryngeal. These should be traced on the left side of the
tongue, where the mucous membrane is still in position.
The glosso-pharyngeal nerve has been traced up to the point
HEAD AND NECK
where it disappears under cover of the hyo-glossus muscle.
There it divides into two branches. The smaller of these
extends anteriorly, upon the side of the tongue, and may be
traced as far as a point midway between the root and the tip.
The larger branch turns upwards, and is distributed to the
mucous membrane which invests the posterior third of the
dorsum linguae. It gives twigs to the vallate papillae, and
some fine filaments may be followed to the anterior surface
of the epiglottis. The glosso-pharyngeal nerve is a nerve of
taste and of common sensibility.
The lingual and hypoglossal nerves are described on pages
289 and 316, and their terminal branches should now be
traced as far as is possible.
Superior longi-

F1g. 173.—Transverse section through the Tongue. (From Aeby.)
The internal laryngeal nerve gives a few delicate filaments
to the glosso-epiglottic and pharyngo-epiglottic folds and the
mucous membrane of the root of the tongue.
The arteria profunda lingua should be followed to the tip
of the tongue, where it forms a small loop of anastomosis with
its fellow of the opposite side.
Septum Lingua?.—The septum of the tongue can be seen
best by making a transverse section through the. organ. This
will display, in a measure, the transverse and vertical muscular
fibres also. The septum is a median fibrous partition. It
is strongest posteriorly, where it is attached to the hyoid
bone. It does not reach the dorsum of the tongue, being
separated from it by the superior longitudinal muscle.
GENERAL APPEARANCE OF BRAIN 437
ENCEPHALON—THE BRAIN.
Directions. — If the brain was divided into two parts, when it was
removed, they should be fixed together with large pins passed through the
cerebellum into the cerebral hemispheres; the brain should then be placed
on a dissecting-room platter, with its superior surface uppermost. It is
necessary to keep it moist, during the whole dissection, by means of a
cloth dipped in water. Unless this is done the membranes are apt to
become dry, and then they are exceedingly difficult to remove.
General Appearance of the Brain.—When viewed from
above, the brain presents an ovoid figure, with the broad end
directed posteriorly. Its greatest transverse diameter is in
the neighbourhood of the part which lies between the two
parietal tubers of the cranium. The only portions which are
visible when the brain is in this position are the two convoluted
hemispheres of the cerebrum. These are separated from each
other by a deep median cleft, called the longitudinal fissure,
which extends from the anterior to the posterior end of the
brain.
The position of the brain should now be reversed. Turn it so that it
rests on its superior surface.
The inferior aspect of the brain is usually termed the
"base." It presents an uneven and irregular surface, which
is more or less accurately adapted to the inequalities on the
floor of the cranium. On this surface the main subdivisions
of the organ may be recognised. Thus, posteriorly is seen the
short cylindrical portion, called the medulla oblongata, through
which, at the foramen magnum, the brain becomes continuous
with the spinal medulla. The medulla oblongata rests on
the under surface of the cerebellum, being received into the
vallecula or hollow which intervenes between the two cere-
bellar hemispheres. The cerebellum is a mass of considerable
size which lies under the posterior parts of the cerebral
hemispheres. It can be easily recognised on account of the
closely set, curved and parallel fissures which traverse its
surface. Above the medulla oblongata, and in direct connec-
tion with it, is a prominent white elevation called the pons.
The basilar artery extends upwards in a median groove on
its surface. Immediately anterior to the pons there is a
deep hollow or recess. This is bounded posteriorly by the

fissura lateralis (O.T. Sylvian fissure), which intervenes between
the pointed and projecting extremity of the temporal lobe and
the frontal lobe of the cerebrum; whilst in the median plane,
anteriorly, the longitudinal fissure will be seen between the
frontal portions of the cerebral hemispheres. On either side
of the longitudinal fissure, and separated from it by a narrow
gyrus, the olfactory tract and bulb may be recognised.
MEMBRANES AND BLOOD VESSELS OF
THE BRAIN.
Arachnoidea Encephali.—The arachnoid forms the inter-
mediate covering of the brain. It is placed between the dura
mater and the pia mater, and is directly continuous with the
arachnoid of the spinal medulla. It is an exceedingly thin
and delicate membrane, which can be seen best on the base
of the brain, as in that locality it is not so closely applied to
the pia mater as elsewhere. Unlike the pia mater it does
not (except in the case of the longitudinal and the lateral
fissures) dip into the sulci or fissures on the surface of the
cerebrum and cerebellum. It bridges over the inequalities on
the surface of the brain and it is spread out in the form of a
very distinct sheet over the medulla oblongata, the pons, and
the hollow on the base of the brain which lies anterior to the
pons. The cut ends of several of the cerebral nerves will be
seen passing through this sheet; whilst, anteriorly, immedi-
ately to the lateral side of the optic nerve, the internal carotid
artery will be noticed piercing it.
Cavum Subarachnoideale.—The interval between the arach-
noid and the pia mater receives the name of the subarachnoid
space. It contains the subarachnoid fluid, and is broken up
by a meshwork of fine filaments and trabeculae, which connects
the two bounding membranes (viz., the arachnoid and the pia
mater) in the most intimate manner, and form a delicate
sponge-like interlacement between them. Where the arach-
noid passes over the summit of a cerebral gyrus, and is con-
sequently closely applied to the subjacent pia mater, the
meshwork is so close and the trabeculas so short that the
two membranes cannot be separated from each other. To
the dissector they appear to form a single lamina. In the
intervals between the rounded margins of adjacent gyri distinct
THE BRAIN
angular spaces exist between the arachnoid and the pia
mater. In these the subarachnoid tissue can be studied, and
it will be seen that these intervals on the surface of the
cerebrum serve as communicating channels for the free
passage of the subarachnoid fluid from one part of the brain
to another. The larger branches of the arteries and veins
of the brain traverse the subarachnoid space; their walls are
directly connected with the subarachnoid trabeculse and are
bathed by the subarachnoid fluid.
Cisternal Subarachnoideales.—In certain situations the
arachnoid is separated from the pia mater by intervals of
Vem Sub-arachnoid space and trabecular

considerable depth and extent. These expansions of the
subarachnoid space are termed cisternae subarachnoideales. In
them the subarachnoid tissue is relatively reduced. There
is no longer a close meshwork; the trabeculse connecting the
two bounding membranes take the form of long filamentous
intersecting threads which traverse the spaces. A beautiful
demonstration of these may be obtained by dividing in the
median plane, with the scissors, the sheet of arachnoid which
is spread over the medulla oblongata and pons, and turning
the two pieces gently aside.
Certain of the cisternae require special mention. The largest and most
conspicuous is called the cisterna cerebello-medullaris (O.T. magna). It is
a direct upward continuation of the posterior part of the subarachnoid space
of the spinal meninges into the posterior part of the cranium. It is formed
by the arachnoid membrane bridging over the wide interval between the
posterior part of the under surface of the cerebellum and the medulla
oblongata.
The cisterna pontis is the name given to another of these recesses. It is
the continuation upwards, on the floor of the cranium, of the anterior part
of the subarachnoid space of the spinal meninges. In the region of the
medulla oblongata it is continuous on either side with the cerebello-medul-
lary cistern, so that this subdivision of the brain is completely surrounded
by a wide subarachnoid space. Within the cisterna pontis are the vertebral
and basilar arteries.
Anterior to the pons the arachnoid membrane crosses between the pro-

jecting temporal lobes, and covers in the deep hollow in this region of the
base of the brain. This space is called the cisterna interpeduncularis,
and within it are placed the large arteries which take part in the forma-
tion of circulus arteriosus. It is continuous anteriorly with the cisterna
chiasmatis, which lies anterior to the optic chiasma and lodges the anterior
cerebral arteries.
All the subarachnoid cisterns communicate in the freest manner with
one another, and also with the narrow intervals on the surface of the cere-
brum. The subarachnoid space does not communicate in any way with
the subdural space. In certain localities, however, it communicates with
the ventricular system of the brain. Three such apertures are described in
connection with the fourth ventricle, whilst another slit, on each side, is said
to lead from the cisterna interpeduncularis into the lower end of the corre-
sponding inferior horn of the lateral ventricle.
Extending laterally from the cisterna interpeduncularis, on each side,
is the cisterna fossae lateralis cerebri, which extends along the stem of the
lateral fissure into the lateral fossa, around the middle cerebral artery.
Anteriorly the cisterna chiasmatis is continuous with a prolongation which
THE BRAIN
extends into the longitudinal fissure with the anterior cerebral arteries.
A dilatation of the subarachnoid space over the dorsum of the mid-brain
round the great cerebral vein (O.T. vena magna Galeni) is called the
cisterna ve1ue magna cerebri.
Granulationes Arachnoideales (O.T. Pacchionian Bodies).
—The connection of the arachnoideal granulations with the"
arachnoid has been referred to already (p. 202).
Pia Mater Encephali.—The pia mater forms the immediate
investment of the brain. It is finer and more delicate than
the corresponding membrane of the spinal medulla, and it
follows closely all the inequalities on the surface of the brain.
Thus, in the case of the cerebrum, it lines both sides of every
sulcus and forms a fold within it. On the cerebellum the
relation is not so intimate; it is only the larger fissures of
the cerebellum which contain folds of pia mater.
It has been noted that the larger blood vessels of the
brain run in the subarachnoid space; the finer twigs enter the
pia mater and ramify in it before passing into the substance
of the brain. As they enter they carry with them sheaths
derived from the pia mater. Consequently, if the dissector
raises a portion of this membrane from the surface of the
cerebrum, a number of fine processes will be seen to be with-
drawn from the cerebral substance. These are the blood-
vessels, and they give the deep surface of the membrane a
rough and flocculent appearance.
The pia mater is not confined to the exterior of the brain.
A fold is carried into its interior. This will be exposed in
the dissection of the brain, and will be described under the
name of the tela chorioidea (O.T. velum interpositum) of the
third ventricle.
Dissection.—The blood vessels of the brain should now be followed out
as far as it is possible to do so without laceration of the brain substance.
Begin by stripping the arachnoid from the base of the brain. This will
bring into view the main trunks. As the vessels of the brain are described,
many parts which have not yet come under the notice of the dissector must
be mentioned.
Arteries which supply Blood to the Brain.—Four main
arterial trunks carry blood into the cranium for the supply
of the brain—viz., the two internal carotid arteries and the
two vertebral arteries. The vertebral arteries enter through
the foramen magnum, whilst the internal carotid arteries gain
admittance through the lacerate foramina after traversing the
carotid canals. These vessels have been divided in the
removal of the brain. The cut ends of the internal carotids
will be seen, on the base of the brain, immediately to the
lateral sides of the optic nerves; the vertebral arteries lie
on the sides of the medulla oblongata. A very remarkable
and complete anastomosis takes place at the base of the
brain by the inosculation of branches which spring from
the internal carotid and vertebral arterial systems. This is
termed the circulus arteriosus (Willis), and the branches
which take part in its formation lie in the cisterna inter-
peduncularis and the cisterna chiasm atis.
Two systems of branches, both going to the cerebrum but
differing greatly in their mode of distribution, proceed from
the vessels forming the arterial circle. One system consists
of very numerous slender twigs, which, as a rule, come off in
groups in certain localities, and at once pierce the substance
of the cerebrum so as to gain its interior. These are the
central or basal branches. The other system is composed of
branches which ramify over the surface of the cerebrum, and
is termed the system of cortical branches. The central parts
of the brain, including the basal ganglia, receive their blood-
supply from the basal system, and the vessels which con-
stitute this group do not anastomose with each other. The
cortical vessels supply the cerebral cortex and the finer
branches, which ramify in the pia mater, anastomose with
one another; therefore, the neighbouring vascular districts of
the cerebral cortex are not sharply cut off from each other.
Arteria Vertebralis.—The vertebral artery enters the sub-
arachnoid space in the upper part of the vertebral canal by
piercing the dura mater and the arachnoid. Gaining the
interior of the cranium, through the foramen magnum, it is
continued upwards on the side of the medulla oblongata.
Soon it inclines to the anterior aspect of the medulla
oblongata, and, meeting its fellow of the opposite side in
the median plane, it unites with it, at the lower border of
the pons, to form the basilar artery.
During this part of its course the vertebral artery gives off
the following branches :—
1. Posterior spinal. I 3. Anterior spinal.
2. Posterior inferior cerebellar. 4. Bulbar.
Arteria Spinalis Posterior.—This is the first branch that
is given off after the vertebral artery pierces the dura mater.
THE BRAIN
It passes downwards on the spinal medulla along the line of
the posterior nerve-roots (p. 193).

cerebellar artery is the largest branch of the vertebral artery.

and pursues a tortuous course posteriorly, on the side of the
upper part of the medulla oblongata, among the fila of the
hypoglossal nerve, and then among the fila of the vagus.
Finally, turning round the restiform body, it gains the vallecula
of the cerebellum, where it ends by dividing into two terminal
branches. Of these, one turns posteriorly, in the vallecula,
between the inferior vermis and the lateral hemisphere of
the cerebellum, whilst the other ramifies on the posterior
part of the inferior surface of the corresponding cerebellar
hemisphere.
Arteria Spinalis Anterior.—The anterior spinal artery arises
near the lower border of the pons, and it is rare to find the
vessels of the two sides of equal size. They converge on
the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata and unite,
forming the commencement of the median vessel which
extends downwards on the ventral face of the spinal medulla.
The bulbar arteries are minute vessels which enter the
substance of the medulla oblongata; they spring both from the
vertebral artery itself and also from its branches.
Arteria Basilaris.—The basilar artery, which is formed by
the union of the two vertebral arteries, is a short trunk. It
extends, in the median plane, from the lower to the upper
border of the pons. At the latter point it ends by dividing
into the two posterior cerebral arteries. The basilar artery
lies in the middle part of the cisterna pontis and occupies
the median groove on the ventral or anterior surface of the
pons. Anteriorly it is supported by the basilar portion of
the occipital bone and the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid.
The branches which spring from the basilar artery proceed
laterally for the most part from either side of the vessel.
They are:—
1. Pontine.
2. Internal auditory.
3. Anterior inferior cerebellar.
4. Superior cerebellar.
5. Posterior cerebral.
Rami ad Pontem.—The pontine branches are numerous
slender twigs which run laterally on the surface of the pons
and enter its substance.
Arteria Auditiva Interna.—The internal auditory artery
will be seen amongst the pontine branches. It accompanies
the acustic nerve into the internal acustic meatus, and is
distributed to the internal ear.
Arteria Cerebelli Inferior Anterior.—This artery inclines
postero-laterally to reach the anterior part of the inferior
surface of the cerebellum.
Arteria Cerebelli Superior.—The superior cerebellar artery
is a large vessel which springs from the basilar close to its
termination. It winds laterally and posteriorly, along the
upper border of the pons, to reach the upper surface of the
cerebellum, upon which it spreads out in a number of large
branches.
THE BRAIN
Arteria Cerebri Posterior.—Immediately beyond the origin
of the two superior cerebellar arteries the basilar trunk
bifurcates into the two posterior cerebral arteries. These
diverge from each other, and, curving laterally and posteriorly,
encircle the mesencephalon. Then they run posteriorly towards
the under surface of the splenium of the corpus callosum.
In this course each posterior cerebral artery lies deeply in
the interval between the corresponding pedunculus cerebri
and the hippocampal gyrus, and, finally, passing on to the
tentorial surface of the cerebral hemisphere it disappears

from view, by sinking into the anterior extremity of the cal-
carine fissure. In this fissure the artery ends by dividing into
two terminal branches, viz., the calcarine and the parieto-
occipital (Figs. 178 and 180).
The oculo motor nerve passes anteriorly in the interval
between the posterior cerebral and the superior cerebellar
arteries, close to the place where they arise from the basilar;
and the small trochlear nerve winds round the pedunculus
cerebri below the posterior cerebral artery.
The following brandies spring from the posterior cerebral artery :—
f Postero-median. I Temporal.
Central or basal -J Postero-lateral. Cortical 1 Calcarine.
[Posterior chorioidal. ( Parieto occipital.
The postero-median central arteries arise close to the origin of the parent
trunk. They proceed upwards, in the interval between the pedunculi cerebri,
and, piercing the substantia perforata posterior (O.T. posterior perforated
space), they supply the thalami and the medial parts of the pedunculi
cerebri.
The postero-lateral central arteries are a group of small slender twigs
which arise on the lateral surface of the pedunculus cerebri, and go to the
corpora quadrigemina and the thalamus.
The posterior chorioidal artery, somewhat larger, goes to the tela
chorioidea of the third ventricle and the chorioid plexus of the lateral
ventricle (Figs. 178 and 179).
The temporal branches, two or three in number, turn laterally, over the
hippocampal gyrus, and ramify on the under surface of the temporal lobe
of the cerebrum (Figs. 178 and 180).
The calcarine branch follows the calcarine fissure to the occipital pole
of the cerebral hemisphere, round which it turns to reach the lateral surface
of the occipital lobe. It is the chief artery of supply to the cuneus and the
lingual gyrus, and is therefore specially concerned in the nutrition of the
visual centres of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 178).
The parieto-occipital artery is the smaller of the two terminal branches
of the posterior cerebral. It runs upwards in the parieto-occipital fissure,
and reaching the upper margin of the cerebrum it turns round it to
reach the lateral surface of the occipital lobe. It supplies branches to the
cuneus and precuneus (Figs. 178, 180).
Arteria Carotis Interna.—The cut extremity of this great
vessel lies on the lateral side of the optic chiasma, in the
angle between the optic nerve and the optic tract. At the
substantia perforata anterior, close to the commencement of
the lateral fissure, it ends by dividing into the anterior and
middle cerebral arteries (Fig. 179). The middle cerebral artery
is the larger of the two terminal branches, and, as it enters the
lateral (O.T. Sylvian) fissure, it appears to be the continuation
of the parent trunk. The anterior cerebral artery, on the
other hand, proceeds medially from the internal carotid at
almost a right angle. This explains how it is that emboli
pass more frequently into the middle cerebral than into the
anterior cerebral artery. From the internal carotid artery,
after it has emerged from the cavernous sinus (p. 331), the
following branches arise :—
1. Ophthalmic (already studied, 3. Chorioidal.
p. 341). 4. Middle cerebral.
2. Posterior communicating. 5. Anterior cerebral.
Arteria Communicans Posterior.—This, as a rule, is a
slender branch which passes posteriorly to join the posterior
cerebral between its postero-median and postero-lateral groups
of basal twigs (Fig. 181).
Arteria Chorioidea.— The chorioidal artery enters the

of the corpus callosum, round which it bends; then it passes
posteriorly along the medial face of the hemisphere, on the
upper surface of the corpus callosum, to the parietooccipital
fissure (Fig. 178). As it lies anterior to the lamina terminalis
it is connected with the opposite anterior cerebral artery by
the anterior communicating artery , and as it passes along the
longitudinal fissure, between the hemispheres, it lies close to
its fellow of the opposite side.

The anterior medial frontal artery ramifies upon the anterior part of the
medial surface of the frontal lobe, and its terminal twigs turn round the
upper margin of the cerebral hemisphere, and supply the upper part of the
lateral surface of the frontal lobe (Fig. 178).
The intermediate medial frontal artery ramifies on the medial surface
of the frontal lobe posterior to the preceding branch. Its terminal part
passes over the paracentral lobule, and reaches the adjacent portion of the
lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 178).
The posterior medial frontal artery ramifies on the medial surface of
the precuneus, and its terminal twigs turn round the upper margin of
the cerebral hemisphere to gain the lateral surface.

soon breaks up into a number of large terminal branches,
which spread out on the surface of the insula. Before the
posterior ramus of the lateral fissure is opened up, to expose
the insula, these branches may be seen emerging from between
its two lips (Fig. 180). Then they diverge and supply a
wide area of cortex on the lateral surface of the hemisphere.
The branches which spring from the middle cerebral artery may be
classified as follows :—
The arteries of the antero-lateral basal group are very numerous. They
pierce the substantia perforata anterior and supply the lentiform nucleus,
the internal and the external capsule, the caudate nucleus, and a portion of
the thalamus.
The frontal and parietal branches turn round the upper lip of the
posterior ramus of the lateral fissure and ascend on the lateral surface of the
hemisphere. The frontal branches are: (I) lateral orbital to the lateral
part of the orbital surface of the frontal lobe; (2) inferior lateral frontal
to the inferior and middle frontal gyri; (3) ascending frontal, which runs
upwards in relation to the anterior central gyrus.
The ascending parietal branch extends in an upward and posterior
direction in relation to the postcentral gyrus, and its terminal twigs supply
the greater part of the cortex of the superior parietal lobule.
The parieto-temporal branch is a very large artery which issues from
the posterior part of the posterior branch of the lateral fissure; it sends
branches upwards to the inferior parietal lobule, and others which incline
downwards over the posterior part of the temporal lobe. Its twigs, as
a rule, do not encroach upon the lateral surface of the occipital lobe.
The temporal branches, two or three in number, issue from the posterior
ramus of the lateral fissure, and, turning downwards and posteriorly, over
its lower lip (i.e. the superior temporal gyrus), they ramify upon the
lateral surface of the temporal lobe.
Oirculus Arteriosus (O.T. Circle of Willis).—This re-
markable anastomosis is placed beneath the base of the brain
in the deep hollow anterior to the pons. It takes the form
of a heptagonal or hexagonal figure, and the vessels which
compose it lie in the cisterna interpeduncularis and the cisterna
chiasmatis. Anteriorly it is closed by the anterior communi-
cating artery which links together the two anterior cerebral
arteries. On either side is the posterior communicating
artery connecting the internal carotid (from which the anterior

ring is completed posteriorly by the bifurcation of the basilar
artery into the two posterior cerebral vessels (Fig. 181). As
a rule the circulus arteriosus is not symmetrical. One posterior

of the opposite side.

its surface. This must be done with the forceps and a pair of scissors.
It is a dissection which requires very delicate manipulation, because the
cerebral nerves, at their points of attachment to the brain, are so intimately
connected with the pia mater that any undue traction applied to the
membranes will tear the nerves away. Indeed, in the case of the
medulla oblongata, the dissector is advised to leave the pia mater in
position until the nerve roots have been studied. The relation of the pia
mater to the fourth ventricle also renders this desirable.
In removing the arachnoid and pia mater from the lateral surface of
the cerebrum, it is well to raise it first from the margins of the hemisphere,
and then to work towards the lateral fissure (Sylvian). By this method, the
membranes and vessels within this great fissure and in relation to the
insula can be withdrawn without damage to the brain substance. Of
course, at the present stage, the membranes cannot be removed from
every part of the brain; but as the dissection proceeds, opportunities for
completing the process will arise.

THE BRAIN
BASE OF BRAIN.
Fossa Interpeduncularis.—When the membranes are re-
moved from the base of the brain, the pedunculi cerebri (O.T.
crura), two large rope-like strands, will be seen issuing from the
upper aspect of the pons. Placed close together as they
emerge from the pons, they diverge as they proceed upwards
and anteriorly, and, finally, each peduncle disappears into the
corresponding half of the cerebrum. Turning round the
lateral aspect of each peduncle, where it passes into the
cerebrum, will be seen a flattened band, called the optic tract.
These bands converge as they pass anteriorly, and are finally
joined together by a short transverse commissural portion,
termed the optic chiasma. This chiasma is placed below the
posterior end of that portion of the longitudinal fissure which
intervenes between the inferior surfaces of the frontal lobes
of the cerebrum. The optic nerves run antero-laterally from
the chiasma.
The cerebral peduncles, the optic tracts, and the optic
chiasma enclose a deep rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped interval
on the base of the brain, which is termed the interpeduncular
fossa. Within the limits of this area the following parts may
be seen. The substantia perforata posterior bounded an-
teriorly by the corpora mamillaria; anterior to the corpora
mamillaria is the tuber cinereum, and attached to it is the
infundibulum of the hypophysis. These structures take part in
the formation of the floor of the third ventricle of the brain.
The oculo-motor nerves issue from the brain within the
interpeduncular fossa. Each nerve emerges from the medial
side of the corresponding pedunculus cerebri.
Substantia Perforata Posterior (O.T. Posterior perforated
space).—At its posterior angle, immediately anterior to the
pons, the interpeduncular fossa is very deep, and is roofed
by a layer of grey matter in which are numerous small
apertures. This is the substantia perforata posterior. From
the apertures which are dotted over its surface the postero-
median basal branches of the posterior cerebral artery have
been withdrawn.
Corpora Mamillaria.—These are two small, white, pea-
shaped eminences placed, side by side, anterior to the sub-

tuber cinereum, immediately posterior to the optic chiasma,
is the infundibulum or stalk of the hypophysis. In the

removal of the brain its connection with that body was

Substantia? Perforata? Anteriores. — These are small
triangular districts of grey matter, one on each side. Each
is bounded posteriorly by the uncinate extremity of the hippo-
campal gyrus; anteriorly by the diverging striae of the
olfactory tract; and medially by the optic tract. Laterally
it passes into the roof of the lateral fissure, and is perforated
by the antero-lateral basal arteries. The grey matter in this
area is continuous above with the grey matter of the lentiform
nucleus (O.T. lenticular).
Lamina Terminalis.—If the anterior border of the optic
chiasma is displaced posteriorly a thin lamina will be noticed.
It passes upwards from the chiasma into the longitudinal
fissure, to become connected with the rostrum of the corpus
callosum. This is the lamina terminalis. It closes the third
ventricle anteriorly, and is continuous on either side with the
grey matter of the substantia perforata anterior.
Superficial Origins of the Cerebral Nerves. — Twelve
cerebral nerves are enumerated arising from the brain on either
side of the median plane. They are the olfactory or first;
the optic or second; the oculo-motor or third; the troch-
lear or fourth; the trigeminal or fifth; the abducent or
sixth; the facial or seventh; the acustic or eighth; the
glossopharyngeal or ninth; the vagus or tenth; the accessory
or eleventh; and the hypoglossal or twelfth.
Each of these nerves is said to have a "superficial" and a
"deep" origin. By the term "superficial origin" is meant
the region where its fibres enter or leave the brain surface;
the term "deep origin " indicates the connections which are
established by the fibres of the different nerves with nuclei or
clusters of nerve-cells within the substance of the brain. These
nuclei are of two kinds: (1) those in connection with which
the afferent or entering nerve fibres end; and (2) those from
which the efferent or emerging nerve fibres arise. It is the
superficial attachments only which come under notice of the
dissector at the present time.
No fewer than eight of the cerebral nerves have a superficial
attachment to the ventral part of the hind brain which is
formed by the medulla oblongata and the pons.
Hypoglossal Nerve.—Upon the lateral aspect of the
medulla oblongata, in its upper half, is a very conspicuous
455
oval prominence called the olive. A distinct sulcus or groove,
which passes downwards anterior to this body, separates it
from an elongated strand, termed the pyramid of the medulla
oblongata. From the bottom of this sulcus and its prolonga-
tion downwards issue a series of nerve fila which belong to two
different nerves. Those which issue from the lower part of
the groove, below the level of the olive, belong to the anterior
root of the first cervical nerve; those which emerge from the
Optic chiasma. S^T"^ °P'iC ""^

upper part of the groove, in the interval between the olive
and the pyramid, form the hypoglossal nerve.
Glosso-pharyngeal, Vagus, and Accessory Nerves.—Posterior
to the olive, in the postero-lateral sulcus of the medulla
oblongata, is another continuous row of nerve f1la. These
extend downwards, beyond the level of the olive, and are
attached to the whole length of the medulla oblongata in
linear order. They belong to three nerves, but it is im-
possible at present (seeing that the nerve-trunks which they

fila which belong to each. From below upwards the nerves
which they form are the accessory, the vagus, and the glosso-
pharyngeal. The fila of the vagus and the glossopharyngeal
are much more closely crowded together than those of the
accessory.
The roots of the accessory, which spring from the medulla
oblongata, constitute only one part of the nerve. The spinal

part springs from the spinal medulla, as low down as the sixth
cervical nerve, by a series of roots which issue from the lateral
funiculus, posterior to the attachment of the ligamentum
denticulatum.
Acustic and Facial Nerves.—These issue close together
at the lower border of the pons, and immediately above the
restiform body. The acustic nerve is the larger of the two,
and it lies on the lateral side of the facial. Its two roots,
termed the cochlear and the vestibular, embrace the restiform
body.

The facial nerve issues from the pons close to its lower

major, composed of a great number of fila loosely held together,
and a small, more compact motor root, portio minor, which
emerges antero-medial to the point at which the sensory root
enters the pons.
Trochlear Nerve.—The superficial origin of the trochlear
or fourth nerve cannot be seen at present. It emerges from
the anterior medullary velum, on the dorsal aspect of the
brain-stem. It is a delicate little nerve which has a long
intracranial course. It winds round the lateral side of the
pedunculus cerebri, between the cerebrum and cerebellum.

antero-laterally from the optic chiasma.
Olfactory Nerves.—These arise from the olfactory bulb
and enter the nasal cavity through the foramina in the
cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone.
General Connections of the Several Parts of the Brain.—
Before proceeding to the more particular study of the different
parts of the brain the student should acquire a general
conception of the manner in which these are connected with
each other. In the posterior cranial fossa, below the ten-
torium, are placed the medulla oblongata, the pons, and
the cerebellum, which constitute collectively the Rhomben-
cephalon or hind-brain. They surround a cavity which is
called the fourth ventricle of the brain, and all stand in
intimate connection with one another. The upper end of
the medulla oblongata terminates chiefly in the pons, but two
large strands on its posterior or dorsal aspect, termed the
restiform bodies, pass posteriorly into the cerebellum (Fig.
185, d). The transverse fibres of the pons are gathered
together on either side in the form of a large rope-like strand,
the brachium ponds. This disappears into the corresponding
hemisphere of the cerebellum (Fig. 185, c).
The great mass of the brain is termed the cerebrum.
This occupies the anterior and middle cranial fossae, and
extends posteriorly into the occipital region above the
tentorium cerebelli. The greater part of the cerebrum is
formed by the cerebral hemispheres, which are separated
from each other, in the median plane, by the longitudinal
fissure. At the bottom of this fissure may be seen the corpus
callosum, a broad commissural band which connects the two
cerebral hemispheres with each other. Each hemisphere is
hollow—the cavity in its interior being termed the lateral
ventricle of the brain. Between and below the cerebral
hemispheres, and almost completely concealed by them, is
the thalamencephalon. The principal parts forming this portion
of the brain are the two thalami, between which is the third
ventricle of the brain—a deep, narrow cavity occupying the
median plane. The third ventricle communicates with the
THE CEREBRUM
459
lateral ventricles through the foramen interventriculare (O.T.
foramen of Monro).
The cerebrum is connected with the parts in the posterior
cranial cavity (pons, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata) by
a narrow stalk called the mid-brain, or mesencephalon. The
mid-brain is built up of a ventral portion, the pedunculi
cerebri, passing between the pons and the cerebrum (Fig.
185, a), and a dorsal portion, the lamina quadrigemina.
It is tunnelled by a narrow passage—the aquaductus cerebri
(O.T. aqueduct of Sylvius)—which connects the fourth and
the third ventricles.
THE CEREBRUM.
Cerebral Hemispheres.—Each cerebral hemisphere presents
a lateral, a medial, and an inferior surface, which are separated
from one another by more or less distinctly marked borders.
The lateral surface is convex, and is adapted to the concavity
of the cranial vault. The medial surface is flat and perpen-
dicular, and is more or less completely separated from the
corresponding surface of the opposite hemisphere by the falx
cerebri, which occupies the longitudinal fissure. The inferior
surface is irregular, and is adapted to the anterior and middle
cranial fossae, and also to the upper surface of the tentorium
cerebelli. Traversing this surface, in a transverse direction,
nearer the anterior than the posterior end of the hemisphere,
is the stem of the lateral fissure (O.T. Sylvian) (Fig. 182).
This deep cleft divides the inferior surface into an anterior
or orbital area, which rests upon the orbital plate of the frontal
bone and is, consequently, concave from side to side, and a
more extensive posterior or tentorial area, which lies on the
floor of the lateral part of the middle cranial fossa and the
upper surface of the tentorium cerebelli. The tentorial
portion of the inferior surface is arched antero- posteriorly,
and looks medially as well as downwards.
The borders which separate the surfaces from each
other are the supero-medial, the superciliary, the infero-
lateral, the medial occipital, and the medial orbital. The
supero-medial border, convex antero-posteriorly, intervenes
between the medial and lateral surfaces. The superciliary
border is highly arched, it separates the orbital surface
THE BRAIN
from the lateral surface. The infero-lateral border marks off
the tentorial part of the inferior surface from the lateral
surface. The medial occipital border is not very distinct,
except in cases where the brain has been hardened in situ.
It extends from the posterior extremity of the hemisphere to
the posterior end of the corpus callosum, and intervenes
between the medial surface and the tentorial part of the inferior
surface. The medial orbital margin extends from the frontal
pole to the lamina terminalis and separates the orbital from
the medial surface.
The most projecting part of the anterior end of the
cerebral hemisphere is called the frontal pole, whilst the
most projecting part of the posterior end is termed the
occipital pole. On the under surface of the hemisphere, the
prominent rounded portion of cerebral substance which ex-
tends anteriorly below the lateral fissure receives the name of
the temporal pole. In a well-hardened brain a broad groove is
usually present on the medial aspect of the occipital pole of
the right hemisphere. This corresponds to the termination
superior sagittal venous sinus.
Longitudinal Fissure.—This great median cleft is occupied
by the fold of dura mater termed the falx cerebri. Anteriorly
and posteriorly, it completely separates the cerebral hemi-
spheres from each other, but the intermediate part is floored
by the corpus callosum—the commissural band which passes
between the hemispheres and connects them together. The
upper surface of the corpus callosum can be displayed by
gently drawing asunder the two sides of the longitudinal
fissure.
Dissection.—If two brains are available, the dissector is advised, at this
stage, to separate the cerebrum from the cerebellum, pons and medulla
oblongata in one of them, by cutting transversely through the mid brain if
this has not been done already. The cerebrum may then be split in the
median plane by placing a long knife in the longitudinal fissure and divid-
ing, with one sweep, the various parts which connect the two sides to each
other. By this proceeding, the three surfaces of each cerebral hemisphere
are exposed, and the gyri and sulci can be studied fully and satisfactorily.
If only one brain is at the disposal of the student, he should not, at this stage,
separate the cerebral hemispheres from each other, but should endeavour
to follow out the gyri and sulci with the various parts of the brain in
position. No doubt he studies the hemisphere in this way at a dis-
advantage, but as the dissection proceeds, opportunities will occur which
will enable him to examine those districts of the surface which he can see
only imperfectly at present.
Cerebral Gyri and Sulci.—The surfaces of the cerebral
461
hemispheres are rendered highly irregular by the presence of
gyri, separated from one another by intervening furrows,
termed sulci and fissures. The surface pattern which is pre-
sented by these gyri and sulci is, in its general features, the
same in all human brains; but when the comparison is
pushed into more detail many differences become manifest,
not only in the brains of different individuals but also in
the two cerebral hemispheres of one individual.
Of the furrows two varieties must be recognised, viz.,
complete and incomplete. The complete fissures are few in
number and they consist of inwardly directed folds which
involve the whole thickness of the cerebral wall. They con-
sequently show in the interior of the cerebral cavity or lateral
ventricle in the form of elevations on its walls. In this
category are included (1) the hippocampal fissure; (2) the
anterior portion of the calcarine fissure; and (3) a portion of
the collateral fissure. The incomplete fissures and the sulci are
merely furrows of varying depth which do not produce any
effect on the surface of the ventricular walls.
General Structure of the Cerebral Hemispheres.—Each
cerebral hemisphere is composed of an outside coating of
grey matter, spread in a continuous and uninterrupted layer
over its surface, and an internal core of white matter. The
grey coating is termed the cerebral cortex, whilst the white
internal part is called the medullary centre. Each gyrus
shows a corresponding structure. It has an external
covering of grey matter supported upon a core of white
medullary matter. But, in addition to the grey matter on the
outside, there are certain large deposits of grey matter em-
bedded in the substance of each hemisphere in its basal part.
These constitute the basal nuclei, and although to a certain
extent they are isolated from the grey matter on the surface,
nevertheless, at certain points, they are directly continuous
with it.
By means of the gyri and sulci the grey matter on the
surface of the hemisphere is increased, and its close
association with the vascular pia-mater is maintained without
any unnecessary increase of the bulk of the organ. The
vascular pia-mater dips into every fissure and sulcus, and
opportunity is therefore afforded for the cortical vessels to
break up into twigs of exceeding fineness before they
enter the substance of the hemisphere. The distribution
462 THE BRAIN
of the blood to the grey cortex is in this way rendered
uniform.
Cerebral Lobes and Interlobar Fissures.—Certain of the
fissures which traverse the surface of the cerebrum are
arbitrarily chosen for the purpose of subdividing the surface
into districts, termed lobes. These fissures, which receive
the name of interlobar, are the following—(1) the lateral
fissure (O.T. Sylvian); (2) the central (O.T. fissure of
Rolando); (3) the parieto-occipital; (4) the collateral; and
(5) the circular sulcus (O.T. limiting sulcus of Reil).

F1g. 186.—Gyri and Sulci on the Lateral Surface of the Cerebral Hemisphere.
The lobes which are mapped out by these fissures are—
(1) the frontal; (2) the parietal; (3) the occipital; (4) the
temporal; (5) the insula. To these may be added a sixth
lobe, in no way related to the interlobar fissures, viz., the
olfactory lobe.
Lateral Fissure (O.T. Sylvian).—This is the most con-
spicuous fissure on the surface of the cerebrum. It is
composed of a short main stem, from the lateral extremity of
which three branches radiate. The stem is placed on the
inferior surface of the cerebrum (Fig. 182). It begins at
the substantia perforata anterior. Thence it passes laterally,
forming a deep cleft between the temporal pole and the
orbital surface of the frontal lobe. Appearing on the lateral
463
surface of the cerebrum the lateral fissure immediately
divides into three radiating branches. These are—(1) the
ramus posterior; (2) the ramus anterior horizontalis; and
(3) the ramus anterior ascendens.
The posterior ramus (Fig. 186) is the longest and the most
important of the three. It extends posteriorly, with a slight
upward inclination, for a distance of three inches or more,
between the frontal and parietal lobes, which lie above it, and
the temporal lobe, which is placed below it. Finally, it
comes to an end by turning upwards into the parietal lobe in
the form of an ascending terminal piece (Fig. 186).
The anterior horizontal limb (Fig. 186) extends anteriorly in
the frontal lobe, for a distance of about three-quarters of
an inch, immediately above and parallel to the posterior
part of the superciliary margin of the hemisphere.
The anterior ascending limb (Fig. 186) proceeds upwards,
with a slight anterior inclination, into the lower part of the
lateral surface of the frontal lobe for a distance of about an
inch. In many cases the two anterior limbs spring from a
common stem of variable length (Fig. 186).
Sulcus Circularis (O.T. Limiting Sulcus of Reil).—If the
lips of the posterior branch of the lateral fissure are now
gently pulled asunder, the insula (O.T. island of Reil) will be
seen at the bottom. This is surrounded by a circular sulcus
which is separable into three parts, viz., an upper part
bounding the insula above, a lower part marking it off below,
and an anterior part limiting it anteriorly. The insula thus
mapped out is somewhat triangular in form.
Opercula Insulae.—The present is a good time to study
the manner in which the insula is shut off from the surface
of the hemisphere. When the lateral fissure is held widely
open, it will be noted that the insula is overlaid by portions
of cerebral cortex which appear as if they were undermined.
These by the approximation of their margins or lips form the
three branches of the lateral fissure, and are termed the
opercula insula. The opercula are four in number, and are
named—(1) temporal, (2) fronto-parietal, (3) frontal, and
(4) orbital. They are easily distinguished.
The temporal operculum extends upwards over the insula
from the temporal lobe; it forms the lower lip of the posterior
branch of the lateral fissure.
The fronto-parietal operculum is carried downwards over
THE BRAIN
the insula to meet the temporal operculum. Its margin
forms the upper lip of the posterior branch of the lateral
fissure.
The frontal operculum (Fig. 186) is the small triangular
piece of cerebral cortex between the anterior ascending and
horizontal branches of the lateral fissure. It is sometimes
termed the pars triangularis.
The orbital operculum (Fig. 186) is for the most part on
the under surface of the hemisphere. It lies below the
anterior horizontal limb of the lateral fissure, and passes
posteriorly from the orbital aspect of the frontal lobe over
the anterior part of the insula.
Sulcus Centralis (O.T. Fissure of Rolando).—The central
sulcus takes an oblique course across the lateral surface
of the cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 186). Its upper end in
many cases cuts the supero-medial border of the hemisphere
a short distance posterior to the mid-point between the
frontal and occipital poles, whilst its lower end terminates
above the middle of the posterior branch of the lateral fissure.
When its superior extremity turns round the supero-medial
border of the hemisphere it is continued posteriorly,
for a short distance, on the medial surface (Fig. 187).
Although in its general direction the sulcus centralis is
oblique, it is far from being straight. Nearer to its upper
than to its lower end it is bent posteriorly so as to form a
bay, within which is accommodated a portion of the cerebral
cortex which represents the motor area of the opposite upper
limb. The upper and lower limits of this bay are termed
the upper and lower genua of the fissure.
Fissura Parieto - occipitalis.—The greater part of this
fissure is situated on the medial surface of the cerebral hemi-
sphere (Fig. 187); only a very small part appears on the
lateral face (Fig. 186).
The lateral part of the parieto-occipital fissure (O.T. external
parietooccipital) cuts the supero-medial border of the hemi-
sphere, in a transverse direction, from one and a half to two
inches anterior to the occipital pole. It is usually not more
than half an inch in length, and it is brought to an abrupt
termination by an arching convolution which winds round its
extremity, and receives the convenient name of arcus parieto-
occipital (Fig. 186).
The medial part of the parieto-occipital fissure (Fig. 187)
465
passes downwards, in a nearly vertical direction, on the medial
surface of the hemisphere, as a conspicuous and deep cleft,
which, at its lower end, joins the calcarine fissure.
Fissura Collateralis (Fig. 187).—The collateral fissure is a
strongly marked fissure on the tentorial part of the inferior
surface of the cerebral hemisphere. It begins near the
occipital pole, and extends anteriorly towards the temporal
pole. Posteriorly it lies below and parallel to the calcarine

fissure, whilst anteriorly it is separated from the hippocampal
fissure by the hippocampal gyrus, which is the highest and
most medial convolution on the tentorial part of the inferior
surface of the hemisphere (Fig. 187).
Anterior to the collateral fissure a shallow sulcus turns
round the anterior end of the temporal lobe and intervenes
between the temporal pole and the uncinate or hook-like
extremity of the hippocampal gyrus. This is the incisura
temporalis or ecto-rhinalfissure (Fig. 188).

THE BRAIN
the medial surface of the hemisphere. It commences on the
lower portion of the anterior part of the medial surface, curves
first upwards and then posteriorly. Finally, turning upwards,
it cuts the supero-medial border of the hemisphere a short
distance behind the upper end of the sulcus centralis, and
terminates on the lateral surface of the parietal lobe. It
separates the anterior portion of the medial surface into a
marginal and a central area. The central part is the gyrus
cinguli (O.T. callosal gyrus). The marginal part is separ-
ated into two portions by a branch of the sulcus cinguli, which
projects upwards above the middle of the corpus callosum.
The anterior part is the medial area of the superior frontal
gyrus; the posterior part is the paracentral lobule.
Boundaries of the Frontal Lobe.—The frontal is the largest
of the cerebral lobes. On the lateral surface of the hemisphere
it is bounded posteriorly by the central sulcus, and below by
the posterior branch of the lateral fissure. On the medial
surface it is limited by the sulcus cinguli; whilst on the inferior
surface of the hemisphere the stem of the lateral fissure
forms its posterior boundary.
Lateral Surface of the Frontal Lobe.—On the lateral
surface of the frontal lobe the following sulci and gyri may be
recognised :—

Sulcus Pracentralis Inferior (Fig. 186).—The inferior prae-
central sulcus consists of a vertical and a horizontal part,
and, when present in a well-marked form, it presents a figure
like the letter T or F. The vertical portion lies anterior to
the lower part of the central sulcus (O.T. fissure of Rolando),
and the horizontal portion extends antero-superiorly into the
middle frontal gyrus.
Sulcus Pracentralis Superior (Fig. 186).—This is a short
vertical sulcus which lies anterior to the upper part of the
467
central sulcus. It is almost invariably connected with the
posterior end of the superior frontal sulcus.
Gyrus Centralis Anterior.—The anterior central gyrus is a
long continuous gyrus which is limited anteriorly by the two
praecentral sulci, and posteriorly by the central sulcus. It
extends obliquely across the hemisphere, from the supero-
medial margin above to the posterior branch of the lateral
f1ssure below (Fig. 186).
Sulcus Frontalis Superior (Fig. 186).—The superior frontal
sulcus extends anteriorly from the sulcus prsecentralis superior.
Gyrus Frontalis Superior (Figs. 186, 187).—The superior
frontal gyrus lies above the superior frontal sulcus and passes
round the supero-medial border on to the medial surface
of the hemisphere. It terminates anteriorly in the frontal
pole.
Sulcus Frontalis Inferior (Fig. 186).—This lies at a lower
level than the superior sulcus of the same name. The posterior
end of the inferior frontal sulcus is placed in the angle
between the vertical and horizontal parts of the inferior
praecentral sulcus, and is not infrequently confluent with one
or other of these. It passes anteriorly towards the superciliary
margin of the hemisphere, and ends a short distance from
it in a terminal bifurcation.
Gyrus Frontalis Medius (Fig. 186).—The middle frontal
gyrus is the broad convolution which lies between the superior
and inferior frontal sulci.
Gyrus Frontalis Inferior (Fig. 186).—The inferior frontal
gyrus is that portion of the lateral surface of the frontal lobe
which is placed anterior to the inferior praecentral sulcus and
below the inferior frontal sulcus.
The sulcus paramedians is the term applied to a series of short
irregular furrows arranged longitudinally, close to the supero-medial border
of the hemisphere. These rudimentary sulci partially subdivide the superior
frontal gyrus into an upper and lower division, and are of interest in so
far that they are best marked in high types of brain.
The middle frontal sulcus (Fig. 186) lies horizontally in the anterior part
of the middle frontal gyrus, and divides it into an upper and a lower
part (Fig. 186). As it approaches the superciliary margin of the hemi-
sphere it bifurcates, and its terminal branches spread out widely from each
other, and together constitute a transverse furrow called the sulcus fronto-
marginalis.
Owing to the subdivision of the superior and middle frontal gyri in the
manner indicated, the gyri in the anterior part of the lateral surface of the
frontal lobe are arranged in five horizontal tiers.

speech-centre. It consists of an upper non-opercular and a
lower opercular portion. The latter is cut up into three parts
by the two anterior branches of the lateral fissure. These
469
are termed the pars basilaris, the pars triangularis, and the
pars orbitalis.
The pars basilaris (Fig. 186) is that part which lies be-
tween the vertical limb of the inferior prsecentral sulcus and
the anterior ascending ramus of the lateral fissure. It forms
the anterior portion of the fronto-parietal operculum, and it
is traversed in an oblique direction by a shallow furrow,
termed the sulcus diagonalis.
The pars triangularis (Fig. 186) is simply another name
for the frontal operculum. It is triangular in form, and lies
between the anterior ascending and anterior horizontal rami
of the lateral fissure.
The pars orbitalis (Fig. 186) is placed below the anterior
horizontal ramus of the lateral fissure.
Medial Surface of the Frontal Lobe.—On this aspect of
the frontal lobe is the elongated, more or less continuous,
medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (O.T. marginal
gyrus). It lies between the supero-medial border of the
hemisphere and the sulcus cinguli (Fig. 187).
In the anterior part of this gyrus one or two curved sulci are usually
present. These are termed the sulci rostrales.
The posterior end of the medial surface of the superior
frontal gyrus is more or less completely cut off from the
anterior part. It forms part of the paracentral lobule, and
lies anterior to the upper end of the central sulcus (Fig. 187).
Orbital Surface of the Frontal Lobe.—On this aspect of
the frontal lobe there are two sulci—viz. the olfactory and
the orbital.
Sulcus Olfactorius.—-The olfactory sulcus (Fig. 188) is a
straight furrow which runs parallel to the medial orbital
border of the hemisphere. It is occupied by the olfactory
tract and bulb, and it cuts off a narrow strip of the orbital
surface close to the medial border which receives the name
of gyrus rectus (Fig. 188).
The orbital sulcus is a compound furrow which assumes
many different forms. Most frequently it takes the shape of
the letter H, of which the three component parts are a
lateral limb, a medial limb, and a transverse limb.
The lateral limb curves round the orbital part of the
inferior frontal gyrus, and limits it medially. The medial
limb marks off a convolution between itself and the olfactory
THE BRAIN
sulcus which receives the name of gyrus orbitalis medialis.
The transverse limb takes a curved course with the concavity
directed posteriorly. It divides the district between the
lateral and medial limbs into an anterior part, or gyrus orbitalis
anterior, and a posterior part, or gyrus orbitalis posterior. The
latter corresponds with the greater part of the orbital oper-
culum.
Boundaries of the Parietal Lobe.—The parietal lobe forms
a considerable part of the lateral surface of the cerebral hemi-
sphere, and it appears also on the medial face, where it forms
the precuneus and the posterior part of the paracentral
lobule. Anteriorly, it is bounded by the central sulcus,
which separates it from the frontal lobe. Below, it is
bounded in the anterior part of its extent by the posterior
branch of the lateral fissure. Posterior to the upturned end
of that fissure, it is quite continuous inferiorly with the
temporal lobe, and an arbitrary line drawn posteriorly on the
surface of the brain in continuation of the posterior branch
of the lateral fissure is taken as its inferior limit (Fig. 186).
Posteriorly, it is separated from the occipital lobe, at the supero-
medial border of the hemisphere, by the lateral part of the
parieto-occipital fissure. Below that it is more or less directly
continuous with the occipital lobe, but an arbitrary line
drawn across the lateral surface of the hemisphere from the
extremity of the parieto-occipital fissure to an indentation
on the infero-lateral border of the hemisphere, termed the
pra-occipital notch, may be regarded as furnishing a posterior
limitation. The prse-occipital notch is, as a rule, visible only
in brains that have been hardened in situ. It is produced
by a slight wrinkle or fold of the dura mater, on the deep
aspect of the parieto-mastoid suture and in relation to the
portion of the lateral venous sinus which lies in this locality.
The notch is placed on the infero-lateral border of the hemi-
sphere, about one inch and a half anterior to the occipital
pole.
Medial Surface of the Parietal Lobe—Praecuneus and
Posterior Part of Paracentral Lobule. — On the medial
surface of the hemisphere the parietal lobe is represented
by the pracuneus and the posterior part of the paracentral
lobule. This district, which is somewhat quadrilateral in form,
lies between the upper end of the central sulcus and the
medial part of the parieto-occipital fissure. Below, it is im-
471
perfectly separated from the gyrus cinguli by a somewhat
variable sulcus called the sub-parietal sulcus (Fig. 187).
Lateral Surface of the Parietal Lobe.—The gyri and
sulci on the lateral surface of the parietal lobe are the
following:—

Interparietal Sulcus of Turner.— This is a composite
sulcus built up of four originally distinct factors. Two of
these, termed the sulcus postcentralis inferior and the sulcus
postcentralis superior, take a more or less vertical course
across the hemisphere, and are frequently continuous with
each other. The other two factors are placed horizontally,
one posterior to the other, and they are called the ramus
horizontalis and the ramus occipitalis.
The sulcus postcentralis inferior lies posterior to the lower
part of the central sulcus (O.T. Rolando), whilst the sulcus
postcentralis superior occupies a similar position in relation
to the upper part of that sulcus. When confluent with each
other they form a long continuous furrow, which stretches
across the hemisphere, posterior and parallel to the central
sulcus (Fig. 186).
The ramus horizontalis (Fig. 186) is continuous with the
upper end of the sulcus postcentralis inferior, and extends
posteriorly, with a slight inclination upwards, between the
superior parietal lobule above and the inferior parietal lobule
below. With the two confluent postcentral sulci it presents a
figure like the letter H placed on its side.
The ramus occipitalis (Fig. 186) is a curved sulcus. It
forms the lateral boundary of the arcus parieto-occipitalis,
which surrounds the lateral part of the parieto-occipital fissure.
Sometimes the ramus occipitalis is linked on to the ramus
horizontalis—more frequently it is separate. Its posterior
end runs into the occipital lobe, and, posterior to the arcus
THE BRAIN
parieto-occipitalis, it bifurcates into two widely spread-out
branches. These form a short transverse fissure in the
occipital lobe, termed the sulcus occipitalis transversus (Ecker)
(Fig. 186).
The upturned ends of the posterior branch of the lateral
fissure, of the superior temporal sulcus and of the middle
temporal sulcus (Fig. 186) extend for a short distance, one
posterior to the other, into the inferior parietal lobule.
Gyri on the Lateral Surface of the Parietal Lobe.—The
interparietal sulcus maps out three districts or areas on the
lateral surface of the parietal lobe. These are the posterior
central gyrus and the superior and inferior parietal lobules.
The gyrus centralis posterior (Fig. 186) is a long gyrus
which extends obliquely across the hemisphere from the supero-
medial border above to the posterior branch of the lateral
fissure below. Anteriorly, it is bounded by the central
sulcus, and posteriorly, by the superior and inferior postcentral
sulci.
The superior parietal lobule is the area of cerebral cortex
which lies between the ramus horizontalis below and the
supero-medial border of the hemisphere above. It is bounded
anteriorly by the superior postcentral sulcus; and posteriorly,
it is connected with the occipital lobe by the arcus parieto-
occipitalis. It is continuous around the supero-medial border
of the hemisphere with the precuneus.
The inferior parietal lobule lies below the ramus horizon-
talis and the ramus occipitalis, and posterior to the inferior
postcentral sulcus. It is more or less directly continuous
with the occipital lobe posteriorly and with the temporal
lobe below. It presents three arching gyri, viz. the supra-
marginal anteriorly, the post-parietal posteriorly, and the
angular between them.
The supra-marginal gyrus (Fig. 186) is folded round the
upturned end of the posterior branch of the lateral fissure and
is continuous with the superior temporal gyrus. The angular
gyrus (Fig. 186) arches over the upturned end of the superior
temporal sulcus, and is continuous with the middle temporal
gyrus. The post-parietal gyrus (Fig. 186) winds round the
upturned end of the middle temporal sulcus, and runs into
the inferior temporal gyrus.
Boundaries of the Occipital Lobe.—The occipital lobe
forms the posterior pyramidal part of the cerebral hemi-
473
sphere, and it encloses the posterior horn of the lateral
ventricle. On the surface it is very imperfectly mapped off
from the parietal and temporal lobes, which lie anterior to it.
It presents three surfaces and an apex or occipital pole. On
the medial aspect of the hemisphere it is separated from the
parietal lobe {i.e. the prsecuneus) by the parieto-occipital
fissure. On the tentorial part of the inferior surface it is not
separated either from the temporal lobe or from the gyrus
hippocampi, which lie anterior to it. It is necessary, there-
fore, on this aspect, to employ an arbitrary line of demarcation,
which extends from the prse-occipital notch, on the infero-
lateral border of the hemisphere, to the isthmus of the gyrus
fornicatus, which lies below the posterior end of the corpus
callosum. On the lateral surface the parieto-occipital fissure,
and an arbitrary line from that fissure to the prae-occipital
notch, may be regarded as separating the occipital from the
parietal and temporal lobes.
Medial Aspect of the Occipital Lobe.—On the medial
surface are (1) the calcarine fissure; (2) the cuneus; and
(3) part of the gyrus lingualis.
The calcarine fissure commences below the isthmus of
the gyrus fornicatus and takes a curved course towards the
occipital pole where it bifurcates into short branches. At a
point somewhat nearer its anterior than its posterior extremity
it is joined by the parieto-occipital fissure and the two fissures
together form a >--shaped figure.
When calcarine and parieto-occipital fissures are fully opened up, so
as to expose the bottom in each case, two well-marked deep or submerged
gyri will be displayed (Fig. 189). One of these, the gyrus cunei, marks
off the parieto-occipital fissure from the calcarine fissure; the other in-
terrupts the calcarine fissure immediately posterior to its junction with
the parieto-occipital. It is called the anterior cuneo-lingual deep gyrus,
and it divides the calcarine fissure into an anterior and a posterior part.
The anterior part of the calcarinefissure corresponds very nearly to the stem
of the >--shaped fissural arrangement. It is very deep and, being a
complete fissure, it gives rise to an elevation, called the calcar avis, on the
medial wall of the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The posterior part
of the calcarine fissure is much shallower.
The cuneus (Fig. 187) is the wedge-shaped or triangular
district on the medial aspect of the occipital lobe between
the parieto-occipital and calcarine fissures.
The gyrus lingualis (Figs. 187, 188) is a well-marked gyrus
situated between the calcarine fissure above and the pos-
THE BRAIN
terior part of the collateral fissure below. It commences at
the occipital pole and narrows, as it passes anteriorly, to its
union with the hippocampal gyrus. It lies partly on the
medial surface and partly on the tentorial surface of the
occipital lobe.
Tentorial Surface of the Occipital Lobe.—On this aspect
lie part of the gyrus lingualis and the posterior part of the
fusiform gyrus. They are separated by the posterior part
of the collateral fissure. The gyrus fusiformis takes part,
anteriorly, in the formation of the temporal lobe, and it is
separated from the inferior temporal gyrus by the inferior
temporal sulcus.

F1g. 189.—Posterior part of medial surface of the Left Hemisphere. The
calcarine and the parieto-occipital fissures are widely opened up to show
the deep gyri within them.
Lateral Surface of the Occipital Lobe.—There are two well-
marked sulci on this surface of the occipital lobe—viz. the
sulcus occipitalis transversus and the sulcus occipitalis lateralis
or sulcus lunatus of Elliot Smith.
The sulcus occipitalis transversus (Fig. 186) extends trans-
versely across the upper part of the lobe posterior to the arcus
parieto- occipitalis. It has already been described as the
terminal bifurcation of the ramus occipitalis of the inter-
parietal sulcus.
The sulcus occipitalis lateralis (Fig. 186) is a short
horizontal furrow which divides the lateral surface of the lobe
into an upper and a lower area of very nearly equal extent.
These areas are connected by means of superficial annectant
gyri with the parietal and temporal lobes.
475
Boundaries of the Temporal Lobe.—The temporal lobe lies
posterior to the stem of the lateral fissure and below its
posterior branch. It presents an upper, a lateral, and a
tentorial surface, with a free apex or pole which projects
anteriorly. Above, it is bounded by the posterior branch
of the lateral fissure together with the artificial line drawn
posteriorly from that fissure. On the tentorial surface it is
separated from the hippocampal gyrus by the collateral fissure;
whilst posteriorly, it is marked off from the occipital lobe by
the arbitrary lines described on p. 470. The apex or temporal
pole projects anteriorly on the under surface of the brain.
It should be noticed that the recurved extremity of the
hippocampal gyrus, which lies to the medial side of the
hemisphere, does not reach the temporal pole, but is
separated from it by the incisura temporalis or ectorhinal
fissure.
Upper or Opercular Surface of the Temporal Lobe.—This
is the surface of the temporal operculum which is opposed to
the insula and the fronto-parietal operculum. The lateral
fissure must therefore be widely opened up to expose it.
For the most part the surface is smooth, but towards its
posterior part there are a few shallow furrows, called the
sulci of Heschl, whilst anteriorly, also on the deep aspect of
the temporal pole, two or three furrows are evident.
Lateral Surface of the Temporal Lobe.—On this aspect of
the lobe there are two horizontal sulci, called the superior
and middle temporal sulci.
The superior temporal sulcus (Fig. 186) is a long, continuous
and deep cleft which begins near the temporal pole and
proceeds posteriorly, below the posterior branch of the lateral
f1ssure. Its posterior end turns upwards, into the parietal lobe,
and is surrounded by the angular gyrus.
The middle temporal sulcus is placed midway between the
superior temporal sulcus and the infero-lateral border of the
hemisphere. It is very rare to find it in the form of a con-
tinuous cleft. Usually it is broken up into several isolated
pieces, placed one posterior to the other. Its posterior part
turns upwards into the parietal lobe (Fig. 186), where it is
surrounded by the post-parietal gyrus, and lies close to the
artificial line of demarcation between the occipital and
parietal lobes.
By these two temporal sulci the lateral surface of the
THE BRAIN
temporal lobe is mapped out into three tiers of horizontal
gyri, which are termed the superior, inferior, and middle
temporal gyri (Fig. 186).
Tentorial Surface of the Temporal Lobe.—On this surface
there is one fissure, termed the inferior temporal sulcus.
The inferior temporal sulcus (Fig. 188) lies below and lateral

to the collateral f1ssure, and close to the infero-lateral border
of the hemisphere. It runs in an antero-posterior direction
and is not always confined to the temporal lobe, but may
extend posteriorly towards the occipital pole. It is usually
broken up into two or more separate pieces.
The fusiform gyrus (Fig. 188) is situated between the
collateral fissure and the inferior temporal sulcus. It extends
from the occipital pole to the temporal pole.
The narrow strip of surface below and lateral to the
477
inferior temporal sulcus is continuous, round the infero-lateral
margin of the hemisphere, with the inferior temporal gyrus
on the lateral surface of the cerebrum, and is reckoned as a
part of it.
The three temporal gyri and the fusiform gyrus run into one
another at the temporal pole.
Insula (O.T. Island of Reil).—The insula is a triangular
field of cerebral cortex which lies on a deeper plane than
the general surface of the hemisphere, and is hidden from
view by the four opercula which overlap it (p. 463). It is
bounded by a distinct limiting sulcus, sulcus circularis (Reil),
which has been described already; and its dependent apical
part or pole, which looks downwards, is in close relation to
the stem of the lateral fissure, and to the substantia perforata
anterior on the base of the brain.
The insula is divided into several diverging gyri by
a series of radiating sulci. Of the latter, one, which pre-
sents the same direction and lies in the same plane as the
central sulcus, receives the name of the sulcus centralis insults.
It divides the insula into an anterior frontal part and a
posterior parietal portion.
Olfactory Lobe.—The olfactory lobe is small and rudi-
mentary in the human brain. It comprises (1) the olfactory
bulb and tract with the three striae, and (2) the trigonum
olfactorium.
The olfactory tract is a narrow white prismatic band, which
expands anteriorly into a swollen bulbous extremity termed
the olfactory bulb. Both the tract and the bulb lie in the
olfactory sulcus on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe,
whilst the inferior surface of the bulb, when the brain is in
position, rests on the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone
and receives the numerous olfactory nerves which reach it
through the foramina in that part of the cranial floor.
Posteriorly, the olfactory tract divides into two or three
diverging striae. The medial stria (O.T. mesial root) curves
abruptly medialwards, and may be followed into the extremity
of the gyrus cinguli and the subcallosal gyrus. The lateral
stria (O.T. lateral root) runs postero - laterally over the
lateral part of the substantia perforata anterior, and gradually
disappears from view. In animals, in which the olfactory
apparatus is better developed than in man, it may be
traced into the uncinate extremity of the hippocampal
THE BRAIN
gyrus. The intermediate stria, which is not always present,
runs posteriorly across the trigonum olfactorium.
The gyrus sub-callosus is a narrow cortical strip, of some morphological
importance, which lies on the medial surface of the hemisphere immediately
below the genu of the corpus callosum.
The trigonum olfactorium is the little triangular field of
grey matter which occupies the interval between the medial
and lateral striae of the olfactory tract at the point where
they begin to diverge.
Gyrus Fornicatus.—This gyrus, sometimes called the
limbic lobe, is seen on the medial and tentorial surfaces of the
hemisphere. It is a ring-like convolution, the extremities of
which approach each other closely at the substantia perforata
anterior.
The upper and anterior part of the gyrus fornicatus lies
in intimate relation to the extremities and upper surface of
the corpus callosum, and it is called the gyrus cinguli. The
lower portion of the gyrus fornicatus is termed the hippocampal
gyrus, and forms the medial part of the tentorial portion of
the lower surface of the hemisphere. The continuity between
the hippocampal gyrus and the gyrus cinguli is established,
below the posterior end of the corpus callosum, by a narrow
portion of the gyrus fornicatus called the isthmus. From this
point the hippocampal gyrus extends anteriorly towards the
temporal pole. Finally, at the side of the pedunculus cerebri,
the hippocampal gyrus is folded on itself, and ends in a
recurved hook-like extremity, termed the uncus. The uncus
does not reach the temporal pole.
The gyrus cinguli (O.T. callosal convolution) begins below
the anterior end of the corpus callosum at the substantia
perforata anterior, and, winding round the genu of the
callosum, it is continued posteriorly on its upper surface to
the thickened posterior extremity or splenium. Finally,
curving round this, it becomes greatly narrowed through
the calcarine fissure cutting into it. This narrow part is
termed the isthmus, and constitutes the link of connection
between the gyrus cinguli and the hippocampal gyrus.
The gyrus cinguli is separated from the superior frontal
gyrus and the paracentral lobule by the sulcus cinguli;
from the praecuneus by the subparietal sulcus; and from the
lingual gyrus by the calcarine fissure. It is separated from
the corpus callosum by the callosal sulcus.
479
The hippocampal gyrus is bounded below and laterally by
the anterior part of the collateral fissure, and anteriorly by
the incisura temporalis, which separates its hooked extremity,
or uncus, from the temporal pole. Supero-medially it
is limited by the hippocampal fissure; whilst posteriorly it
is divided into two parts by the anterior extremity of the
calcarine fissure. Of these, the upper is the isthmus, which
connects it with the gyrus cinguli, whilst the lower portion
is continuous with the gyrus lingualis.
If the hippocampal fissure, which lies above the hippocampal gyrus,
is opened up, in a soft brain, the fascia dentata and the fimbria lying, side
by side will be brought into view. In a hardened brain the examination
of this region should be deferred (p. 492). -
The Corpus Callosum.
A dissection should now be made with the view of exposing
the upper surface of the corpus callosum, which is the com-
missural band connecting the cerebral hemispheres at the
bottom of the longitudinal fissure.
Dissection.—With a long knife slice off the top of the right hemisphere
at the level of the sulcus cinguli. The white medullary centre of the
cerebral hemisphere, enclosed on all hands by the grey cortex, is brought
into view, and the appearance receives the name of centrum semi-ovalc.
From the central white mass medullary prolongations proceed into all
the gyri.
A transverse incision may next be made through the middle of the
gyrus cinguli; then the anterior and posterior parts of the gyrus cinguli
should be torn away from the hemisphere in a lateral direction. If this
is done successfully the manner in which the fibres of the corpus
callosum enter the hemisphere will be seen. In cases where the student
is dissecting the brain for the second time the knife should not be used
at all in carrying out this dissection. The top of the hemisphere down
to the level of the sulcus cinguli should, in the first instance, be torn off,
and then the gyrus cinguli may be treated in the same way. By this
expedient the fibres of the corpus callosum may be traced into the gyri.
Cingulum.—If the deep surface of the gyrus cinguli,
which has been torn away, is examined, a large bundle of
longitudinally directed fibres will be noticed embedded in its
substance. This is the cingulum. It can be easily dislodged;
a very slight degree of traction is all that is required to
lift it out of its bed. It begins anteriorly at the substantia
perforata anterior, curves round the convexity of the corpus
callosum, and then descends, round its posterior end, and
terminates in the hippocampal gyrus. The cingulum is a
THE BRAIN
long association bundle composed of several systems of f1bres
which run only for short distances within it. It is closely
associated with the gyrus fornicatus.
Dissection.—The gyri and sulci on the medial surface of the left hemi-
sphere may now be studied, and then the dissection, which has been
carried out with the view of exposing the corpus callosum, may be repeated

on the left side. In doing this, however, take care not to injure the medial
surface of the left hemisphere posterior to the parieto - occipital fissure.
Indeed, an effort should be made to preserve that fissure intact, so that it
and the cuneus may be studied afterwards, on this side, in connection with
the gyri and sulci on the under surface of the hemisphere.
The upper surface of the corpus callosum is now exposed, and it will
be seen that it unites into one mass the medullary centres of the two
hemispheres. The continuous white field, consisting of the corpus callosum
and the medullary centre of each hemisphere, receives the name of
centrum ovale.
Corpus Callosum.—This is the great transverse commissure
of the cerebrum. It is placed nearer the anterior than the
posterior end of the brain, and it unites the medial surfaces of
the two cerebral hemispheres throughout very nearly a half of
their antero-posterior length.
Its upper surface is convex antero-posteriorly and concave
from side to side, and it forms the bottom of the longitudinal
fissure. On each side of the fissure it is covered by the
gyrus cinguli (O.T. callosal gyrus). Only in its posterior part

is it touched by the falx cerebri; anteriorly, that fold of dura
mater falls considerably short of it. The upper surface of
the corpus callosum is coated by an exceedingly thin layer
of grey matter continuous, at the bottom of the callosal
sulcus, with the grey cortex of the hemisphere. In this are
embedded, on either side of the median plane, two delicate
longitudinal bands of fibres called the striae longitudinales
medialis and lateralis. The stria longitudinalis medialis is the
more strongly marked of the two, and it is separated from
vol. 11—31

The stria longitudinalis lateralis is placed more laterally.
So thin is the grey coating of the corpus callosum that
the transverse direction of the bundles of callosal fibres
can be easily seen through it.
The stria: with the thin layer of grey matter associated with them
represent a gyrus called the gyrus supracallosus.
The two extremities of the corpus callosum (Fig. 192) are

greatly thickened, whilst the intermediate part, the truncus
(O.T. body) is considerably thinner. The massive posterior
end, which is full and rounded, lies over the mesencephalon,
and extends posteriorly as far as the highest point of the cere-
bellum. It is called the splenium. The anterior end, which
is not quite so massive, is folded, downwards and posteriorly,
upon itself, and is called the genu. The recurved lower
portion of the corpus callosum rapidly thins as it passes
posteriorly, and is termed the rostrum. The fine terminal
edge of the rostrum, the lamina rostralis, is connected with
the lamina terminalis (Fig. 192).
Both the lateral and the medial longitudinal striae, which
lie upon the upper surface of the corpus callosum, turn

downwards, round the splenium, and end in the fasciola
cinerea. The fasciola cinerea, which is situated immediately
beneath the splenium, is a narrow strip of grey matter,
continuous posteriorly with the medial and lateral striae
of the same side and anteriorly with the fascia dentata
hippocampi. Anteriorly, the striae pass round the genu, and
then along the under surface of the rostrum until they
terminate in the corresponding gyrus subcallosus. The gyrus
subcallosus is a ridge which descends from the rostrum of the
corpus callosum and passes to the surface of the substantia
perforata anterior. There the fibres of the striae contained
in the gyrus emerge from its substance, and pass postero-
laterally along the posterior limit of the substantia perforata
anterior towards the anterior extremity of the temporal lobe.
Fibres of the Corpus Callosum.—The transverse fibres of the corpus
callosum, as they enter the white medullary centre of the cerebral hemisphere,
radiate from each other towards various parts of the cerebral cortex. This
radiation is called the radiatio corporis callosi. The more anterior of the
fibres which compose the genu of the corpus callosum sweep anteriorly
in a series of curves towards the frontal pole of the hemisphere. They
form the forceps minor. A large part of the splenium, forming a solid
bundle termed the forceps major, bends suddenly and abruptly posteriorly
into the occipital lobe. Fibres from the trunk of the corpus callosum and
also from the splenium curve round the lateral ventricle and form a very
definite stratum called the tapetum. This is a thin layer in the medullary
centre of the hemisphere which forms the roof and lateral wall of the
posterior horn and the lateral wall of the posterior part of the inferior horn
of the lateral ventricle.
Ventr1culus Lateral1s.
The lateral ventricle, in the interior of the cerebral hemi-
sphere, should now be opened up on each side. The corpus
callosum, which forms the roof of the central part (O.T. body)
and anterior horn of this cavity, must, therefore, be partially
removed.
Dissection.—Make a longitudinal incision, through the corpus callosum,
about a quarter of an inch from the median plane on each side. The central
portion of the corpus callosum which lies between these incisions is to be
kept in position. The lateral portions must be turned laterally and
detached completely. As this is being done, it will become evident that the
lower part of the splenium which is prolonged into the forceps major is in
reality a portion folded anteriorly in close apposition with the under surface
of the posterior end of the corpus callosum. Be careful to leave the forceps
major in its place.
The central part and the anterior horn of the ventricle are now exposed;

difficulty will be experienced in opening up the inferior horn. Place the
point of the knife in the upper part of the horn, where it joins the central
part of the ventricle, and carry the blade in an anteroinferior direction,

through the lateral part of the temporal lobe, towards the temporal pole,
following the course of the cavity. This corresponds very nearly with the
course of the superior temporal sulcus. The lateral wall of the inferior
horn is thus incised, and a sufficient amount of the lateral part of the
temporal lobe must be removed to give a view of the cavity. In doing this,
the temporal operculum will be taken away, but the surface of the insula
should be preserved from injury.
Lateral Ventricle.—The dissector will now perceive that
each cerebral hemisphere is hollow. The cavity in the interior
is called the lateral ventricle. It is lined with a thin dark-
Central part of lateral ventricle

coloured layer of epithelium, which is termed the ependyma. In
certain places its walls are in apposition with each other, but
in other localities spaces of varying capacity, and containing
cerebro-spinal fluid, are left between the bounding walls. The
lateral ventricle communicates with the third ventricle of the
brain by means of a small foramen, which is termed the
interventricular foramen (O.T. foramen of Monro). This
aperture, which is just large enough to admit a crow-quill,
lies at the anterior end of the thalamus, and posterior to
the column of the fornix (O.T. anterior pillar).
The shape of the lateral ventricle is very irregular, and
can be best understood by the study of a plaster cast of
its interior (Fig. 195). It is composed of a central part
(O.T. body) and three horns, viz., an anterior, a posterior,

and an inferior horn. The anterior horn is that part of the
cavity which lies anterior to the interventricular foramen.

Cornu Anterius Ventriculi Lateralis.-—The anterior horn
forms the anterior part of the cavity, and extends antero-
laterall y and downwards in the frontal lobe. When seen in
frontal section it presents a triangular outline—the floor
sloping upwards and laterally to meet the roof at an acute
angle (Fig. 197). It is bounded anteriorly by the posterior
surface of the genu of the corpus callosum, whilst the roof is
formed by the anterior part of the trunk of the corpus
callosum. The medial wall, which is vertical, is formed by

the septum pellucidum—a thin median partition between
the lateral ventricles of opposite sides. The sloping floor
presents a marked elevation or bulging, viz., the smooth
rounded and enlarged anterior extremity of the pear-shaped

Pars Centralis Ventriculi Lateralis.—The central part
of the ventricle is roofed likewise by the corpus callosum.
On the medial side it is bounded by the posterior part of the

of the fornix to the under surface of the corpus callosum.

On the lateral side it is closed, as in the case of the anterior
horn, by the meeting of the roof and the floor of the cavity.
On the floor a number of important objects may be
recognised. Latero-medially, and, at the same time, to some
extent antero-posteriorly, these are—(1) the caudate nucleus;
(2) a groove extending obliquely, postero-laterally, between
the caudate nucleus and the thalamus, in which are placed
the terminal vein (O.T. vein of corpus striatum) and a white
band called the stria terminalis (O.T. t»nia semicircularis);

the chorioid plexus; (5) the thin sharp lateral edge of the

The caudate nucleus as it passes posteriorly, on the lateral
part of the floor of the central part of the lateral ventricle,
narrows very rapidly.
The terminal vein is seen through the ependyma in the
groove between the caudate nucleus and the thalamus. It
joins the internal cerebral vein (O.T. vein of Galen) at the
interventricular foramen. In the same groove is placed the
stria terminalis—a narrow band of white matter, which bends
downwards and disappears from view in the region of the

interventricular foramen. Its fibres ultimately reach the
substantia perforata anterior, in which they end.
The portion of the upper surface of the thalamus, which
appears in the floor of the lateral ventricle is, in great part,
covered by the chorioid plexus of the lateral ventricle. The
plexus is a rich vascular fringe which appears from under
cover of the sharp lateral edge of the fornix. It is con-
tinuous anteriorly, through the interventricular foramen, with
the corresponding chorioid plexus of the opposite side; whilst
posteriorly, it is carried into the inferior horn of the ventricle.
Although the chorioid plexus has all the appearance of lying
free within the ventricle it is invested by an epithelial layer
THE BRAIN
of ependyma, which excludes it from the cavity and is
connected on the one hand to the sharp margin of the fornix,
and on the other to the upper surface of the thalamus.
Cornu Posterius Ventriculi Lateralis. — The posterior
horn is a diverticulum which runs, from the posterior end of the
central part of the ventricle, into the occipital lobe. It tapers
to a point and describes a gentle curve, the convexity of
which is directed laterally. The roof and lateral wall of
this portion of the ventricular cavity is formed by the tapetum
of the corpus callosum.
Upon the medial wall two elongated curved elevations
may be seen. The upper of these, termed the bulb of the
cornu, is produced by the fibres of the forceps major as
they curve posteriorly, from the lower part of the splenium
of the corpus callosum, into the occipital lobe. The lower
elevation is known as the calcar avis. It varies greatly in
size, in different brains, and is caused by an infolding of the
ventricular wall which corresponds with the anterior part of
the calcarine f1ssure.
Dissection. — The dissector should now insinuate his fingers underneath
the fronto-parietal operculum of the insula and tear this portion of the
cortex away in an upward direction. The frontal operculum (pars
triangularis) and the orbital operculum should be dealt with in the same
manner. The greater part of the temporal operculum has already been
removed in opening up the inferior horn of the ventricle; therefore the
insula is now fully exposed to view, and its relation to the parts in the
interior of the ventricle can be seen.
Cornu Inferius Ventriculi Lateralis (O.T. Descending
Cornu).—The inferior horn must be regarded as the direct
continuation of the main ventricular cavity into the temporal
lobe. The posterior horn is merely a diverticulum from the
main cavity. At first directed postero-laterally, the inferior
horn suddenly sinks downwards, posterior to the thalamus, into
the temporal lobe, in which it takes a curved course, antero-
medially, to a point about an inch posterior to the extremity
of the temporal pole. In the angle between the diverging
inferior and posterior horns the cavity of the ventricle exhibits
a triangular expansion of varying capacity. This is called the
trigonum collaterals
The lateral wall of the inferior horn is formed, for the
most part, by the tapetum of the corpus callosum. At the
extremity of the horn the roof presents a slight bulging into the
ventricular cavity. This is the amygdaloid tubercle, and it is
491
produced by a superjacent collection of grey matter, termed
the amygdaloid nucleus. The stria terminalis and the greatly
attenuated and expanded tail of the caudate nucleus are both
prolonged into the inferior horn, and are carried anteriorly in
its roof to the amygdaloid nucleus.
On the floor of the inferior horn the dissector will note
the following parts: (1) the hippocampus; (2) the chorioid
plexus; (3) the fimbria; and (4) the eminentia collateralis.
Hippocampus (O.T. Hippocampus Major).—This is over-
lapped by the chorioid plexus, which must be turned aside.

It is a prominent elevation on the floor of the inferior horn
of the lateral ventricle, and is strongly curved in conformity
with the course taken by the horn in which it lies. It pre-
sents, therefore, a medial concave margin and a lateral convex
margin. Narrow posteriorly, it enlarges as it is traced
anteriorly, and it ends, below the amygdaloid tubercle, in a
thickened extremity, the pes hippocampi. The surface of the
pes hippocampi is marked by some faint grooves which inter-
vene between a number of ridges called the hippocampal
digitations. The hippocampus is the internal elevation which
corresponds to the hippocampal fissure on the exterior of the
wall of the ventricle.
Fimbria (Hippocampi).—The fimbria is a narrow but very
THE BRAIN
distinct band of white matter which is attached by its lateral
margin along the concave medial border of the hippocampus.
The white matter composing it is continuous with the thin
white layer (alveus) which is spread over the surface of the
hippocampus, and it presents two free surfaces and a sharp
free medial border. The fimbria has been noted already
in connection with the hippocampal fissure and the fascia
dentata (p. 479), and the relations which it presents to the
cms of the fornix and the uncus are pointed out on p. 494.

Chorioid Fissure of the Cerebrum.—When the pia mater
in the region of the hippocampal fissure is removed from the
surface of the brain, the chorioid plexus in the interior of the
inferior horn of the lateral ventricle is usually withdrawn with
it, and a fissure appears between the fimbria and the roof
of the ventricular horn. This is termed the chorioid fissure of
the cerebrum; it is the lower part of the great transverse fissure.
By the withdrawal of the chorioid plexus it is converted into
an artificial gap, which leads directly from the exterior of the
brain into the interior of the inferior horn of the lateral
ventricle.

lateral ventricle, through the chorioid f1ssure of the cerebrum.
It lies on the surface of the hippocampus and, at the
posterior extremity of the thalamus, it becomes continu-
ous with the chorioid plexus in the central part of the
THE BRAIN
lateral ventricle (Fig. 200). But it must not be supposed
that the chorioid plexus lies free in the ventricular cavity. It
is clothed in the most intimate manner by an epithelial epen-
dymal layer, which represents the medial wall of the inferior
horn pushed into the cavity by the chorioid plexus. The
ventricle, therefore, opens on the surface through the chorioid
fissure only after this thin epithelial layer is torn away by
the withdrawal of the chorioid plexus.
Eminentia Collaterals.—This eminence may present two
distinct forms, which may be distinguished from each other
as the eminentia collateralis posterior and the eminentia col-
lateral anterior.
The posterior collateral eminence is a smooth elevation in
the floor of the trigonum collaterale, in the interval between
the calcar avis and the hippocampus as they diverge from
each other. The anterior collateral eminence is not always
present. It forms an elongated elevation on the floor of the
inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, on the lateral side of
the hippocampus. Both eminences correspond to the col-
lateral fissure on the tentorial aspect of the cerebral
hemisphere.
Dissection.—The remains of the right temporal lobe and of the right
occipital lobe should now be detached from the cerebrum by cutting through
the forceps major of the splenium of the corpus callosum and through
the fimbria where it passes into the crus of the fornix. The knife should
then be carried anteriorly from the anterior extremity of the inferior
horn, above the level of the uncus, through the temporal pole. The
temporal lobe, with the hippocampal gyrus along its medial side, can
then be separated from the remainder of the brain, along the line of
the chorioid fissure of the cerebrum. In the detached part of the cerebrum
(Fig. 201) a good view is obtained of the floor of the inferior horn and
of the parts in relation to it. Further, by replacing it in position, the
chorioid fissure can be better understood, and by turning the brain upside
down a view is obtained of the roof of the inferior horn and the structures
in relation to it. In this way the tail of the caudate nucleus and the stria
terminalis can be traced into the amygdaloid nucleus.
The cut edge of the central part of the corpus callosum, which is still in
position, should now be still further pared away, so as to bring the sub-
jacent septum pellucidum and the fornix more fully into view.
Fimbria (Figs. 200, 201).—This is simply a continuation
of the crus (O.T. posterior pillar) of the fornix. It is a con-
spicuous band of white matter, which presents a prominent free
border. Anteriorly, it runs into the recurved extremity of
the uncus, whilst, if it is traced posteriorly, it will be seen
to curve upwards, posterior to the thalamus, and become
495
continuous with the cms of the fornix below the posterior
part of the corpus callosum (p. 491).
Fascia Dentata Hippocampi. — The fascia dentata is
the free edge of grey matter which is placed between the
fimbria and the deep part of the upper surface of the hippo-
campal gyrus. The groove between it and the fimbria
is termed the fimbrio-dentate sulcus. Its margin is notched,
and its surface is scored with numerous closely-placed
transverse grooves. It begins posteriorly, in the region of
the splenium of the corpus callosum, and it runs anteriorly
into the cleft of the uncus, from which it emerges again in
the form of a delicate band, called the frenulum of Giacomini,
which crosses the recurved part of the uncus in a transverse
direction.
Hippocampal Fissure.—This is a complete fissure, and the
elevation on the ventricular wall, which corresponds to it, is
called the hippocampus (Fig. 217). It begins posterior to
the splenium of the corpus callosum, where it is continuous
with a shallow part of the callosal sulcus, and it passes
anteriorly, between the fascia dentata and the hippocampal
gyrus. Its anterior end is embraced by the uncus.
Septum Pelt.uc1dum—Forn1x—Tela Chor1o1dea
Ventr1cul1 Tert11.
Septum Pellucidum.—This is a thin vertical partition which
intervenes between the anterior cornua and the anterior parts
of the central portions of the two lateral ventricles (Fig. 198).
It is triangular in shape, and is prolonged posteriorly in the
narrow interval between the trunk of the corpus callosum
and the fornix, to each of which it is attached. Anteriorly,
it occupies the gap posterior to the genu of the corpus
callosum; whilst below, in the narrow interval between the
rostrum of the corpus callosum and the fornix, it is prolonged
downwards to the base of the brain (Fig. 207).
The septum pellucidum is composed of two thin laminfe
which lie one on each side of the median plane. The median
cleft between the layers is termed the cavum septi pellucidi
(O.T. fifth ventricle) (Figs. 194 and 196).
Dissection.—The narrow middle strip of the corpus callosum, posterior
to the genu, should now be removed. Cut it transversely across, and, gently
raising it, separate the upper edge of the septum pellucidum from its lower
THE BRAIN
surface. Posterior to the septum pellucidum the under surface of the
median part of the corpus callosum will be found to lie upon and to be
connected with the upper surface of the fornix. Sever this connection
also. The left half of the forceps major should be preserved, so that its
connection with the occipital lobe may be more fully made out later. By
snipping off the upper edge of the septum pellucidum with the scissors, the
two laminae, with the interposed cleft, will be exposed.
Cavum Septi Pellucidi (O.T. Fifth Ventricle).—This is the

isolated, having no communication either with the ventricles
or with the exterior.
Fornix.—The fornix is an arched structure, composed of
longitudinal and transverse fibres. It consists of a central
part or body, which ends in two columns anteriorly and two
crura posteriorly.
Corpus Fornicis.—The body of the fornix is triangular in
shape. Anteriorly, where it is continuous with the columns,
it is narrow; posteriorly it broadens out, becomes flattened,
and is prolonged into the crura. The upper surface of the
body of the fornix is in contact with the under surface of the
corpus callosum, and is adherent to it in the median plane
497
posteriorly. More anteriorly it is attached to the posterior
part of the lower edge of the septum pellucidum. Beyond
these attachments the upper surface of the body of the fornix
forms a part of the floor of the lateral ventricle, on each side,
and is clothed with ependyma. It presents a sharp lateral
edge, from under which the chorioid plexus projects into the
cavity of the lateral ventricle. The lower surface of the
body of the fornix rests upon the tela chorioidea of the third
ventricle (O.T. velum interpositum), a fold of pia mater which
separates it from the third ventricle and the two thalami.
Columna Fornicis (O.T. anterior pillars).—The two columns
of the fornix are two rounded strands which emerge from the
anterior end of the body of the fornix, and then, diverging
slightly, pass downwards anterior to the interventricular
foramen. Their lower ends sink into the grey matter on the
lateral walls of the third ventricle, and end at the base of the
brain in the corpora mamillaria.
Each corpus mamillare has the appearance of being a twisted loop of
the corresponding column of the fornix, in which the fibres turn upon
themselves, and are then continued upwards and posteriorly into the
anterior tubercle of the thalamus. This appearance, however, is decep-
tive. In the interior of the corpus mamillare there is a nucleus of grey
matter. In this the fibres of the column end; while the other fibres,
which seem to be continuous with the fornix fibres, take origin within the
nucleus. The strand, thus formed, is called the fasciculus thalamo-
mamillaris (O.T. bundle of Vicq d'Azyr) (Fig. 203).
The connections which have just been described cannot be made out at
present, but at a later period the dissector will experience little difficulty
in tracing the column of the fornix to the corpus mamillare, and in dis-
playing the connection of this with the fasciculus thalamo-mamillaris.
Crura Fornicis (O.T. posterior pillars).—The crura of the
fornix are flattened bands which diverge widely from the body
of the fornix. At first they are adherent to the under sur-
face of the corpus callosum, but soon they sweep downwards,
round the posterior ends of the thalami, and enter the inferior
horns of the lateral ventricles. There each crus comes into
relation with the corresponding hippocampus, and a portion of
its fibres become spread out on the surface of that prominence,
forming the alveus, whilst the remainder constitute the fimbria,
which has been described already (p. 494, Fig. 203).
The transverse fibres of the fornix cross the lower surface
of the body and the anterior part of the interval between the
diverging crura. In the latter place they may be adherent
to the lower surface of the corpus callosum. On each side
vol. 11—32
THE BRAIN
they are continuous with the longitudinal fibres of the crura
and constitute a transverse commissure between the hippo-
campi of opposite sides.
Dissection.—The body of the fornix should now be divided transversely,
across its middle. Its posterior and anterior portions may then be raised
from the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle, and thrown apart from
each other. Had it been possible to raise the corpus callosum and fornix
together, the diverging crura of the fornix would have been seen to limit

the parts in its vicinity. The fornix has been divided and thrown posteriorly.
a triangular space on the under surface of the corpus callosum, anterior to
the posterior margin of the splenium. This interval is termed the lyra;
it is traversed by a series of oblique markings which indicate the presence
of the transverse fibres passing across from one crus of the fornix to the
other.
Tela Chorioidea Ventriculi Tertii (O.T. Velum Inter-
position).—This lamina is formed by a double layer of pia
mater which intervenes between the body of the fornix above,
and the roof of the third ventricle and the two thalami below.
Between the two layers are blood-vessels and some subarach-
499
noidal trabecular tissue. In shape this tela is triangular, and
the narrow anterior end or apex reaches the interventricular
foramen. The base lies under the splenium of the corpus
callosum, and there the two layers of pia mater which form
the tela become continuous with the pia mater on the surface
of the brain.
Along each lateral margin the tela is bordered by the
chorioid plexus of the central part of the lateral ventricle,
which projects into the ventricular cavity from under cover
of the lateral free edge of the fornix. Posteriorly, this
chorioid plexus is continuous with the plexus in the inferior
horn of the ventricle; whilst anteriorly, it narrows greatly,
and becomes continuous, across the median plane, with the
corresponding plexus of the opposite side. From this
median junction two much smaller chorioid plexuses run
posteriorly, on the under surface of the tela, and project
downwards into the third ventricle. These are the chorioid
plexuses of the third ventricle (Fig. 205).
The most conspicuous blood-vessels in the tela chorioidea
of the third ventricle are the two vena cerebri internee
(O.T. veins of Galen), which run posteriorly—one on either
side of the median plane. Anteriorly, each is formed, at the
apex of the fold, by the union of the vena terminalis with a
large vein issuing from the chorioid plexus; posteriorly, they
unite to form the great cerebral vein (O.T. vena magna
Galent), and this pours its blood into the anterior end of
the straight sinus (Fig. 88).
Transverse Fissure.—This name is given to the continuous
cleft through which the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle
and the chorioid plexuses of the two inferior horns of the
lateral ventricles are introduced into the interior of the brain.
It consists of an upper or intermediate part and two lateral
parts. The intermediate part passes anteriorly between the
splenium of the corpus callosum and the body of the fornix
above, and the roof of the third ventricle and the thalami
below. It is limited by the ependymal covering of the
chorioid plexuses, which shuts out these structures from the
cavity of the lateral ventricles.
The lateral parts of the transverse fissure are the chorioidal
fissures. Each is continuous with the intermediate part, and
has been studied already in connection with the inferior
horn of the lateral ventricle (p. 492).

Dissection.—Each vena terminalis should now be divided as it unites
with the internal cerebral vein. The apex of the tela chorioidea should
then be seized with the forceps and pulled posteriorly, till the whole
structure is reversed. The entire upper surface of the thalamus on
each side is thus exposed, and, between the thalami, is seen the third
ventricle. The epithelial roof of this ventricle, which is invaginated into
the cavity by the chorioid plexuses of the third ventricle on the under
surface of the tela, is torn away with the tela. The basal part of the tela
is intimately connected with the pineal body, which lies on the mesen-
cephalon behind the third ventricle. Care therefore must be taken to
extricate this body from the pia mater ; otherwise it is sure to be pulled
away.

of the thalamus lies close to the median plane, and is separ-
ated from the corresponding part of the opposite side only
by a very narrow interval. The enlarged posterior ends of
the two thalami are placed more widely apart; and in the
interval between them, the corpora quadrigemina are situated.
In their anterior two-thirds, the two thalami lie close together,
but are separated by a deep median cleft, the third ventricle
of the brain. Each thalamus presents an anterior and a
posterior extremity, and four surfaces. The inferior and
lateral surfaces are in apposition and, indeed, directly con-
nected with adjacent parts. The superior and medial surfaces
are free.
The lateral surface of the thalamus is applied to a mass

of white matter, termed the internal capsule, which is composed
largely of fibres from the basis pedunculi. The inferior or
ventral surface of the thalamus rests chiefly upon the sub-
thalamic region, which is the prolongation upwards of the
tegmental part of the pedunculus cerebri. The relation,
therefore, which the thalamus presents to the upward continua-
tion of the pedunculus cerebri is very intimate.
The superior surface of the thalamus is free. On the
lateral side it is bounded by the groove which inter-
11—32 6
THE BRAIN
venes between the thalamus and the caudate nucleus and
contains the vena terminalis and the stria terminalis. On
the medial side, the superior surface of the thalamus is
separated, in its anterior half, from the medial surface by a
sharp edge, or prominent ledge, of the ependyma of the
third ventricle. This is called the tania thalami, and the
ridge which it forms is accentuated by the fact that subjacent
to it there lies a longitudinal strand of fibres called the stria
medullaris. A short distance anterior to the pineal body the
taenia lies upon the upper border of a raised white band, the
habenula.
The habenula divides posteriorly into two parts, one of which becomes
continuous with the pineal body, whilst the other passes across to the
opposite habenula, through the habenular commissure, which lies anterior
to the pineal stalk.
Between the habenula medially and the upper quadrigeminal
body posteriorly, lies a small triangular depressed area, the
trigonum habenula.
The superior surface of the thalamus is slightly convex,
and is of a whitish colour owing to the presence of a thin
superficial coating of nerve fibres (stratum zonale). It is
divided into two areas by a faint oblique groove which
begins near the anterior extremity of the thalamus, and ex-
tends obliquely, laterally and posteriorly. This sulcus corre-
sponds to the free lateral edge of the fornix. The two areas
thus mapped out are very differently related to the ventricles
of the brain. The lateral area includes the anterior extremity
of the thalamus, and forms a part of the floor of the lateral
ventricle; it is covered with ependyma, and overlapped by
the chorioid plexus. The medial area intervenes between
the lateral and third ventricles of the brain, and takes no
part in the formation of the walls of either. It is covered
with the tela chorioidea, above which is the fornix. It
includes the posterior extremity of the thalamus.
The anterior extremity of the thalamus, called the anterior
tubercle, is rounded and prominent. It projects into the
lateral ventricle, lies postero-lateral to the free portion of the
column of the fornix, and bounds the interventricular foramen
posteriorly.
The posterior extremity of the thalamus is very prominent,
and projects posteriorly over the mesencephalon (Fig. 206).
This projecting part is called the pulvinar. But the posterior
5°3
end of the thalamus shows another prominence. This is
situated below and to the lateral side of the pulvinar. It is
oval in form, and receives the name of the corpus geniculatum
laterale.
The medial surfaces of the two thalami are placed very
close together, and are covered not only with the lining
ependyma of the third ventricle, but also with a moderately
thick layer of grey matter continuous with the grey matter
which surrounds the aquseductus cerebri (Sylvius). A band
of grey matter, termed the massa intermedia, crosses the third
ventricle and joins the two thalami together.
Corpus Fineale.—This is a small body of a darkish colour,
and about the size of a cherry-stone, which is placed between
the posterior extremities of the two thalami on the dorsal
aspect of the mesencephalon (Fig. 206). It occupies the
depression between the two superior quadrigeminal bodies,
and is shaped like a fir-cone. Its base, which is directed
anteriorly, is attached by means of a hollow stalk or peduncle.
This stalk is separated into a dorsal and a ventral part by a
continuation into it of a pointed recess of the cavity of the
third ventricle. The dorsal part of the stalk becomes con-
tinuous on each thalamus with the taenia thalami; the ventral
part is folded round a narrow but conspicuous cord-like band
of white fibres (posterior commissure) which crosses the median
plane immediately below the base of the pineal body.
Commissura Anterior Cerebri.—In the anterior part
of the cleft between the two thalami, and immediately
anterior to the columns of the fornix, a round bundle of
white fibres will be seen crossing the median plane. This
is the anterior commissure. It is very much larger than the
posterior commissure, and will be afterwards followed towards
the temporal lobe, in which the greater part of it ends.
Ventriculus Tertius.—This name is given to the deep
narrow cleft between the two thalami. It is deeper anteriorly
than posteriorly, and extends from the pineal body posteriorly
to the anterior commissure and lamina terminalis anteriorly.
Its floor is formed by the parts already studied within the
interpeduncular fossa on the base of the brain, viz., the tuber
cinereum, the corpora mamillaria, and the grey matter of the
substantia perforata posterior, and also, more posteriorly, by the
tegmenta of the cerebral peduncles. Anteriorly, it is bounded
by the lamina terminalis and the anterior commissure; whilst
THE BRAIN
its lateral walls are formed by the medial surfaces of the
two thalami. A little anterior to the middle of the ventricle
the cavity is crossed by the massa intermedia, which connects
the thalami with each other, and anterior to this the column
of the fornix is seen descending in the lateral wall. At first
the column is distinct and prominent, but as it approaches
the corresponding corpus mamillare it gradually becomes

more rand more sunk in the grey matter on the side of the
ventricle.
The roof of the third ventricle is formed by a thin epithelial
layer which stretches across the median plane, from the one
taenia thalami to the other, and is continuous with the
remainder of the epithelial lining of the cavity. It is applied
to the under surface of the tela chorioidea, which overlies the
ventricle, and is invaginated into the cavity by the chorioid
plexuses which hang down from the under surface of that
fold of pia mater. In the removal of the tela chorioidea
the thin epithelial roof was torn away.
The third ventricle communicates freely with the lateral
ventricles, and also with the fourth ventricle. The aqua-
ductus cerebri (Sylvius), a narrow channel which tunnels the
mesencephalon, brings it into communication with the fourth
ventricle. The opening of this canal will be seen at the
posterior part of the floor of the ventricle, immediately below
the posterior commissure. The interventricular foramen, which
puts it into communication with the two lateral ventricles, is a
Y-shaped aperture which lies at the anterior part of the ventricle,
and its two diverging limbs pass laterally and slightly upwards,
between the most prominent parts of the columns of the fornix
and the anterior tubercles of the thalami. They are usually
large enough to admit a crow-quill, and through them the
epithelial lining of the three ventricles becomes continuous.
FORAMEN INTERVENTRICULARS

F1g. 208.—Diagrammatic outline of the Third Ventricle
as viewed from the side.
From each lateral part of the interventricular foramen a
distinct groove passes posteriorly, on the lateral wall of the
ventricle, to the mouth of the aquseductus cerebri. It is
termed the sulcus hypothalamics.
The outline of the third ventricle is seen to be very irregular when
it is viewed from the side in a median section through the brain (Fig. 207),
or as it is exhibited in a plaster cast of the ventricular system of the brain.
It presents several diverticula or recesses. Thus, in the anterior part of the
floor there is a deep funnel-shaped recess, recessus infundibuli, leading down,
through the tuber cinereum, into the infundibulum of the hypophysis.
Another recess, recessus opticus, lies above the optic chiasma. Posteriorly,
two additional recesses are present. One, the recessus pinealis, passes
posteriorly, above the posterior commissure and the entrance of the aquae-
ductus cerebri, for a short distance into the stalk of the pineal body.
The second is placed above this, and is carried posteriorly for a greater
distance. Its walls are epithelial, and therefore it cannot be seen in an
ordinary dissection. It is termed the recessus suprapinealis.
Dissection.—The further study of the cerebral hemispheres should be
postponed until after the examination of the mid-brain or mesencephalon.
The membranes should be removed from the upper surface of the cere-
bellum, and the prominent anterior part of that organ may then be
pulled posteriorly to expose, as far as possible, the corpora quadrigemina,
i.e. the four rounded eminences on the dorsal aspect of the mesencephalon.
In doing this, care should be taken to secure and preserve the slender
trochlear nerve which issues from a lamina, called the anterior medullary
velum, immediately below the inferior pair of quadrigeminal bodies, and
winds round the lateral side of the pedunculus cerebri.
THE MESENCEPHALON.
The mesencephalon is the stalk which occupies the aperture
of the tentorium cerebelli, and connects the cerebral hemi-
spheres with the parts in the posterior cranial fossa.1 It is
about three-quarters of an inch long, and it consists of
a dorsal part, the lamina quadrigemina, and a much larger
ventral part, which is formed by the two large pedunculi cerebri
In the undissected brain the lamina quadrigemina is com-
pletely hidden from view by the splenium of the corpus
callosum, which projects posteriorly over it, and also by
the superimposed cerebral hemispheres. The pedunculi
cerebri, however, can be seen, to some extent, at the base of
the brain, where they bound the posterior part of the inter-
peduncular fossa. The mesencephalon is tunnelled from
below upwards by a narrow passage called the aquaeductus
cerebri (Sylvius). This channel lies much nearer the dorsal
than the ventral surface.
Lamina Quadrigemina.—The dorsal surface of the lamina
quadrigemina is raised into four eminences or colliculi, two
superior and two inferior, which are called the corpora quadri-
gemina. Each colliculus is composed, for the most part, of
grey matter, although each has a superficial coating of white
fibres. The superior pair are larger and broader than the
inferior pair, but they are not so well defined nor yet so
prominent.
A longitudinal and a transverse groove separate the quadri-
geminal bodies from each other. The longitudinal groove
occupies the median plane, and extends upwards as far as the
posterior commissure. From its lower end a short but well-
defined narrow band of white fibres, the frenulum veli, passes
to the anterior medullary velum, a lamina placed immediately
below the inferior pair of quadrigeminal prominences. The
1 If the mesencephalon was divided, when the brain was removed, the
divided parts must be fixed together with pins while the superficial characters
are being studied.
THE MESENCEPHALON

OPTIC TRACT
upper part of the longitudinal groove is occupied by the
pineal body. The transverse groove curves round posterior
to each of the superior pair of quadrigeminal bodies and
separates them from the inferior pair.
Brachia of the Corpora Quadrigemina.—The corpora
quadrigemina are not marked off from the side of the mesen-
cephalon, for each body has in connection with it, on that
aspect, a prominent white strand, which is prolonged upwards
and anteriorly under the projecting pulvinar. The strands
are called the brachia of the corpora quadrigemina, and they
are separated from each other by a continuation, on the side
of the mesencephalon, of the transverse groove which inter-
venes between the two pairs of bodies.
Corpus Geniculatum Mediale.—Closely connected with
the brachium of the inferior quadrigeminate body will be seen
the corpus geniculatum mediale.
It is a little oval eminence, very ""^'n*" C0RP.aEN:LAT

The 1nfer1or brach1um proceed-
ing upwards from the lower quadrigeminal body advances
towards the corpus geniculatum mediale, and disappears
from view under cover of that prominence. Upon the
opposite side of the same geniculate body, the medial root
of origin of the optic tract arises, and the appearance is
such that the dissector might very naturally conclude that
the inferior brachium and the root of the optic tract are
continuous. That, however, is not the case. The superior
brachium is carried upwards and anteriorly between the
overhanging pulvinar and the corpus geniculatum mediale.
It partly enters the corpus geniculatum laterale, but a portion
of it is directly continuous with the lateral root of the optic
tract.
The optic tract divides at its posterior end into a medial and a lateral
root. The medial root enters the corpus geniculatum mediale. The

THE BRAIN
lateral root is partly continuous with the superior brachium, and partly
with the corpus geniculatum laterale and the pulvinar. The superior
quadrigeminal body, the corpus geniculatum laterale, and the pulvinar
constitute the lower visual centres.
Pedunculi Cerebri (O.T. crura cerebri).—The pedunculi
cerebri constitute the chief bulk of the mesencephalon.
When viewed from below, they appear as two large rope-
like strands, which emerge, close together, from the upper
aspect of the pons, and diverge as they proceed upwards to
enter the cerebral hemisphere. At the point where each
peduncle disappears into the corresponding hemisphere, it is
embraced, on its lateral side, by the optic tract and the gyrus
hippocampi.
The pedunculus cerebri of each side consists of two parts,
viz., a dorsal tegmentum, which is prolonged upwards to the
region below the thalamus; and a ventral basis (O.T. crusta),
which is carried upwards into the internal capsule on the
lateral side of the thalamus. When the base of the brain
is examined it is the basis pedunculi which is seen. It is
white in colour and streaked in the longitudinal direction.
On the exterior of the mesencephalon, the separation between
the two parts of the pedunculus cerebri (i.e. the tegmentum
and the basis pedunculi) is indicated by a medial and a
lateral groove or sulcus. The medial sulcus is the deeper

and more distinct. It looks into the interpeduncular fossa,
and from it emerge the fila of the oculo-motor nerve.
It consequently receives the name of the sulcus oculomotorius.
The lateral sulcus is termed the sulcus lateralis.
Cut Surface of the Mesencephalon. — Much nearer the
dorsal than the ventral surface of the mesencephalon the
transversely divided aquaductus cerebri may be seen. This
narrow passage leads from the fourth ventricle below to the
third ventricle above. It is surrounded by a thick layer
of grey matter, called the central grey matter of the
aqueduct. In a fresh brain this is always very conspicuous,
and in its midst are situated the nuclei of the oculo-
motor and trochlear nerves, and the upper motor nucleus
of the trigeminal nerve, although of course these cannot,
except in very favourable circumstances, be detected by
the naked eye. Below, the grey matter of the aqueduct
is continuous with the grey matter spread out on the
anterior wall of the fourth ventricle; whilst above, it is con-
tinuous with the grey matter on the floor and sides of the
third ventricle.
The division between the tegmentum and the basis
pedunculi, on each side, is rendered very evident by a con-
spicuous lamina of dark pigmented matter which intervenes
between them. This is termed the substantia nigra.
Substantia Nigra.—As seen in transverse section, the sub-
stantia nigra presents a somewhat crescentic outline. It is
a thick band interposed between the basal and tegmental
parts of the pedunculi cerebri, and it consists of a mass of
grey matter in the midst of which are large numbers of pig-
mented nerve cells. It begins below, at the upper border
of the pons, and it extends upwards into the subthalamic
region. Its margins come to the surface at the oculo-motor
and lateral sulci, and its medial part is traversed by the
emerging fibres of the oculo - motor nerve. The surface
turned towards the tegmentum is concave and uniform; the
opposite surface is convex, and is rendered highly irregular
by the presence of numerous slender prolongations of its
substance into the basis pedunculi.
Basis Pedunculi (O.T. crusta).—The basis pedunculi is
somewhat crescentic when seen in section, and stands quite
apart from its fellow of the opposite side. It is composed of
a compact mass of longitudinally directed nerve fibres which
are carried upwards into the internal capsule. The inter-
mediate third or more of each basis pedunculi is composed
of the important cerebrospinal fasciculus (O.T'. pyramidal tract)
as it descends from the motor area of the cerebral cortex,
but this is quite indistinguishable from the portions of the
crusta which lie on either side of it.
Inferior quadrigeminal body

Substantia nigra
F1g. 211.—Transverse section through the Mesencephalon at the level of the
inferior quadrigeminal body: the right side only is reproduced. The
drawing is taken from a Weigert-Pal specimen, and therefore the grey
matter is pale and the strands of white matter are dark. The dark colour
of the substantia nigra is not evident owing to the thinness of the section.
Tegmentum.—Unlike the basis pedunculi, the tegmentum
is undivided, a faint line in the median plane, termed the
median raphe, alone indicating its bilateral character. To-
wards the dorsum of the mesencephalon it is fused with the
bases of the corpora quadrigemina, and its lateral surfaces
only are free.
The tegmentum is composed of an admixture of grey and white matter,
constituting what is termed a formatio reticularis. The white matter is
composed of fibres running both transversely and longitudinally. Certain
of the longitudinal fibres are grouped together and form well-marked
tracts, which, in a section through the mesencephalon of a fresh brain, can
be detected by the naked eye. These tracts are: (1) the medial longi-
tudinal bundles; (2) the brachia conjunctiva; (3) the lemniscus.
The medial longitudinal bundle (Figs. 211 and 212) is a small compact
fasciculus which is placed upon the lateral aspect of the lower portion of
the central grey matter of the aqueduct.
The brachia conjunctiva (O.T. superior cerebellar peduncles) are two

large strands which are continued upwards from the cerebellum into the
mesencephalon. By pulling away the margin of the cerebellum, where it
overlaps the lower quadrigeminal bodies, these brachia will be seen on the
surface as they converge in an upward direction. Stretching across the
interval between them, and bringing them into continuity with each other,
is a thin lamina called the anterior medullary velum. When the brachia
conjunctiva reach the bases of the inferior quadrigeminal bodies, they
sink into the substance of the mesencephalon, and, in a transverse section
through the lower part of this portion of the brain, they may be seen as two
white strands, semilunar in outline and placed one on either side of the
grey matter of the aqueduct. As they ascend, they gradually assume a
deeper (i.e. a more ventral) position in the tegmental part of the mesen-
THE BRAIN
cephalon, and they decussate with each other across the median plane and
proceed upwards to the red nuclei.
The term lemniscus (O.T. fillet) is given to two tracts presenting very
different connections. The medial lemniscus (Figs. 211 and 212) is a
sensory tract passing upwards to the thalamus. The lateral lemniscus
belongs to the auditory apparatus, and is a part of a chain through which
the cochlear nuclei establish connection with the inferior quadrigeminal
body and the medial geniculate body. The lateral lemniscus can be
readily detected as it emerges from the upper part of the lateral sulcus of
the mid-brain, and passes, postero- superiorly, to the lower border of the
inferior quadrigeminate body and inferior brachium. It has the form of
a raised triangular band which encircles the lateral surface of the upper
end of the brachium conjunctivum (Fig. 221).
Within the upper part of the tegmentum there is a collection of nuclear
matter which is termed the nucleus ruber, from its ruddy appearance
when seen in section. It is rod-like in form, and extends upwards into the
tegmental region below the thalamus. In transverse section it presents a
circular outline, and it is closely associated with the upward prolongation
of the fibres of the brachia conjunctiva cerebelli. The brachium conjunc-
tivum cerebelli is an efferent tract from the nucleus dentatus of the
lateral hemisphere of the cerebellum, and its fibres end in the red nucleus
and the pulvinar of the thalamus of the opposite side. The tegmentum
of the pedunculus cerebri may be considered to consist of two parts : viz.,
a lower part, which is subjacent to the inferior quadrigeminal bodies,
and is largely occupied by the decussation of the brachia conjunctiva
cerebelli; and an upper part, subjacent to the superior quadrigeminal
bodies, which is traversed by the emerging bundles of the third nerve,
and contains the nucleus ruber.
BASAL GANGLIA OF THE CEREBRAL
HEMISPHERES.
The basal ganglia of the cerebral hemispheres must now
be examined. They are the caudate and lentiform nuclei,
which together form the corpus striatum; the claustrum;
and the amygdaloid nucleus. With these it is necessary to
study also the composition of the thalamus and the external
and internal capsules.
Dissection.—The right and left portions of what remains of the cerebrum
should be separated from each other by a median incision. On the left
portion the sulci and gyri on the lower surface of the hemisphere may be
examined, if this has not been done already on another specimen.
A series of sections should, in the next place, be made through both the
right and left portions of the cerebrum, with the view of displaying the basal
ganglia. On the right side remove a succession of thin slices by carrying a
long knife in a horizontal direction through the parts which form and lie below
the floor of the central part of the lateral ventricle. It is not advisable to
proceed farther down than the level of the anterior commissure.
On the left side of the brain a series of vertical-transverse or frontal
sections should be made through the remaining portion of the cerebrum.

cavity of which it bulges. It is a piriform highly arched
mass of grey matter, which presents a thick swollen head or
anterior extremity, and a long attenuated tail. The head
projects into the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle, whilst its
narrower part is prolonged laterally and posteriorly on the
floor of the central part of the ventricle, where it is separated
from the thalamus by the stria terminalis. Finally, its tail
turns downwards and then anteriorly into the inferior horn

with ependyma, and a deep surface embedded in the sub-
stance of the hemisphere, and for the most part related to the
internal capsule.
Owing to its arched form, it follows that in horizontal
sections, below a particular level, it is cut at two points, and
both the head and the tail must be looked for in the field of

is, for the most part, completely embedded within the

occupy so large an area as the nucleus caudatus. Indeed, it
presents a very close correspondence in point of extent with
the insula on the surface.

shape similar to that of a biconvex lens. Its medial surface

its anterior portion. Here it is semilunar or crescentic in
outline. Further, it is intimately connected with the head
of the caudate nucleus by bands of grey matter which pass
between the two nuclei and break up the anterior part of the
internal capsule. It is due to the ribbed or barred appear-
ance which is presented by such a section as this that the
term corpus striatum is given to the two nuclei.
When the section is made in a more posterior plane, the
divided lentiform nucleus assumes an altogether different
shape, and is seen to be completely cut off from the caudate
nucleus by the internal capsule (Fig. 216). It is now tri-
angular or wedge-shaped. Its base is turned towards the
external capsule, the claustrum, and the insula; its medial
surface is applied to the internal capsule; whilst its inferior
surface is directed downwards towards the base of the brain.

and internal medullary laming which traverse its sub-
stance and divide it into three zones. The lateral, basal,
and larger zone is termed the putamen (Fig. 216). It is
darker in colour than the other two zones, and is traversed by
fine radiating white streaks. The two medial zones are of a
faint yellowish tint, and together they form what is termed
the globus pallidus (Figs. 213 and 216). The putamen has a
greater antero-posterior length than the globus pallidus. It
follows from this that it alone is connected with the head of
the caudate nucleus by the intervening bands of grey matter
(Fig. 215).
The nucleus Ientiformis comes to the surface at the
substantia perforata anterior, and a continuity between the
grey matter forming it and the grey cortex of the brain is
thus established.

bedded in the white matter which intervenes between the
lentiform nucleus and insula (Figs. 213 and 216). Followed
in an upward direction, it becomes gradually thinner until it
ultimately appears, when seen in section, as an exceedingly

it thickens considerably, and at the base of the brain it
comes to the surface, at the substantia perforata anterior,
and becomes continuous with the grey matter of the cerebral
cortex. Its extent corresponds very nearly with the area
occupied by the insula, and its lateral surface shows ridges
and depressions corresponding to the insular gyri and sulci.
Capsula Interna.—This term is applied to the broad band
of white matter which intervenes between the lentiform
nucleus laterally, and the thalamus, stria terminalis, and
caudate nucleus on the medial side. Anteriorly it is much

broken up, by the connecting bands of grey matter which
pass between the head of the caudate nucleus and the
anterior part of the putamen of the lentiform nucleus (Fig.
215), but more posteriorly it forms a solid white mass of
nerve fibres. When seen in horizontal section, the internal
capsule is bent upon itself opposite the interval between the
caudate nucleus and the thalamus (Fig. 216). This bend,
which points medially, is called the genu. About one-third
of the internal capsule lies anterior to the genu, and this
part is called the anterior limb; the remaining two-thirds,
which lie posterior to the genu, constitute the posterior limb.
Connections of the Internal Capsule.—The internal capsule
is directly continuous below with the basis of the cerebral

peduncle. The dissector can easily satisfy himself in the
specimens before him of this continuity; it is apparent in the
more posterior of the frontal sections which he has made
through the left portion of the cerebrum.
It has been mentioned already that the fibres which occupy the middle
third or more of the basis of the cerebral peduncle belong to the motor
cerebro-spinal fasciculus. In the internal capsule these fibres occupy the
anterior two-thirds of the posterior limb, being thus placed immediately
posterior to the genu. The fibres which constitute the medial third of the
basis pedunculi come from the anterior limb of the internal capsule; whilst
the fibres which form the lateral third of the basis pedunculi are situated
in the posterior limb.
When the fibres of the internal capsule are traced upwards, they are
found to spread out in a radiating manner so as to reach the various
gyri of the cerebral hemispheres. This arrangement is termed the
corona radiata. As the fibres. of the corona radiata are liberated from
the internal capsule, and spread out to reach their destinations, they are
intersected by fibres of the corpus callosum, which also radiate in
every direction to gain the cortex of the cerebrum, and they are inter-
sected also by bundles of association fibres.
Nuclei of the Thalamus.—When a horizontal section
is made through the thalamus in a fresh brain, or in one
which has been preserved by means of formalin or a chromic
salt, the grey matter composing it is seen to be broken up
into a lateral, a medial, and an anterior nucleus by thin
white medullary laminae.
Capsula Externa.—This term is applied to the thin
stratum of white matter which intervenes between the
lentiform nucleus and the claustrum (Figs. 213 and 216).
Dissection.—The fasciculus thalamo-mamillaris and the anterior com-
missure should now be followed, as far as this is possible, in what remains
of the right half of the cerebrum. The dissection is not difficult.
By the removal of the remains of the lentiform nucleus the anterior com-
missure will be exposed in its course towards the temporal lobe. In the first
instance, it passes transversely, then postero-laterally below the putamen.
Next it bends suddenly in a posterior direction above the inferior horn of
the lateral ventricle to reach the medullary centre of the temporal lobe.
If the dissection be successfully accomplished, the anterior commissure
will be seen to present a twisted or rope-like appearance.
The fasciculus thalamo-mamillaris may be traced from the corpus
mamillare upwards into the anterior nucleus of the optic thalamus by
scraping away the grey matter on the side of the third ventricle. The
continuity between the column of the fornix and the corpus mamillare
should at the same time be established. Within the corpus mamillare there
is a nucleus of grey matter.
The dissectors have now examined all those portions of the brain which
lie in the anterior and middle cranial fossae, and certain terms, not hitherto
mentioned in connection with the various structures which have been
studied, now require consideration. It has been noted already that the
n—33 b
part of the brain which connects the lower segment in the posterior fossa
with the upper segment in the middle and anterior fossa is called the
mesencephalon. The parts above the mesencephalon form collectively
the prosencephalon, and the mesencephalon and prosencephalon together
constitute the cerebrum.
The prosencephalon itself is separable into two main parts, the telen-
cephalon (end brain), and the diencephalon. The telencephalon
includes the cerebral hemispheres with their grey nuclei, the olfactory
bulbs and tracts and the associated parts, and the pars optica hypo-
thalami; under the latter term are included the tuber cinereum, the
infundibulum, the hypophysis, the optic tracts, the optic chiasma, and
the lamina terminalis.
The diencephalon includes two closely associated segments, the pars
mamillaris hypothalami and the thalamencephalon.
The pars mamillaris hypothalami is formed by the mamillary bodies
and those portions of the walls of the third ventricle which lie below the
sulcus hypothalamicus. The thalamencephalon is separated into the
thalamus (O.T. optic thalamus), the metathalamus, formed by the two
geniculate bodies, and the epithalamus, which consists of the pineal body,
the habenula, the habenular commissure, and the trigonum habenulae.
THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN WHICH LIE IN
THE POSTERIOR CRANIAL FOSSA.
The parts which lie below the tentorium cerebelli in the
posterior cranial fossa are the medulla oblongata, the pons,
and the cerebellum. These are grouped around the fourth
ventricle of the brain—a cavity which communicates with the
central canal of the medulla spinalis below and with the
aqueeductus cerebri above; and they constitute the rhomben-
cephalon or hind brain.
Medulla Oblongata.—This is the continuation of the spinal
medulla into the brain. It is not more than one inch in length,
and may be reckoned as beginning at the level of the foramen
magnum. Thence it proceeds upwards, in a very nearly vertical
direction, and ends at the lower border of the pons. At first
its girth is similar to that of the spinal medulla, but it rapidly
expands as it approaches the pons, and consequently it
presents a more or less conical appearance. Its anterior
surface lies in the groove on the basilar portion of the
occipital bone, whilst its posterior aspect is sunk into the
vallecula of the cerebellum.
The medulla oblongata is a bilateral structure, and this is
evident even on an inspection of its exterior. The antero-
median and postero-median sulci on the surface of the spinal
MEDULLA OBLONGATA
521
medulla are prolonged upwards on the anterior and posterior
surfaces of the medulla oblongata.
The antero-median groove, as it passes from the spinal
medulla on to the medulla oblongata, is interrupted, at the
level of the foramen magnum, by several strands of f1bres
which cross the median plane from one side to the other.
This intercrossing is termed the decussation of the pyramids.
Above this level the furrow is carried upwards to the lower

border of the pons. There it expands slightly, and ends in
a blind pit, termed the foramen cacum.
The postero-median fissure is carried up for only half the
length of the medulla oblongata. Then the central canal of
the medulla spinalis becomes the fourth ventricle of the brain,
and as it expands dorsally it pushes aside the lateral lips of
the posterior median sulcus till the epithelium of its posterior
wall appears on the surface, in the triangular interval between
the diverging posterior columns of the medulla oblongata,
THE BRAIN
where it forms the posterior wall or roof of the lower part
of the fourth ventricle.
The surface of each lateral half of the medulla oblongata
should now be studied. It is well, however., to defer the
examination of the medullary part of the floor of the fourth
ventricle till a later period. The dissector has already noticed
two linear rows of nerve f1la issuing from and entering the
medulla oblongata on each side. The anterior row consists
of the roots of the hypoglossal and the uppermost part of the
anterior root of the first cervical nerve. They continue up-
wards on the medulla oblongata in the line of the anterior
nerve roots of the spinal medulla, and they emerge along the
bottom of a more or less distinct groove. The posterior row is
formed of the nerve fila of the accessory, vagus, and
glosso-pharyngeal nerves, and they lie in series with the
posterior roots of the spinal nerves.
By these two rows of nerve fila, each side of the
medulla oblongata is divided into three districts, viz., an
anterior, a lateral, and a posterior, similar to the surface areas
of the three funiculi on the side of the medulla spinalis. At
first sight, indeed, they appear to be direct continuations
upwards of those portions of the spinal medulla; it is easily
demonstrated, however, that that is not the case, and that the
fibres in the three funiculi of the medulla spinalis undergo a
rearrangement as they are traced into the medulla oblongata.
Anterior Area of the Medulla Oblongata—Pyramis.—The
district between the antero-median furrow and the row of
hypoglossal nerve fila issuing from the medulla receives the
name of the pyramid. An inspection of the surface is almost
sufficient to show that this is formed by a compact mass of
longitudinally directed fibres. It expands somewhat, and
assumes a more prominent appearance as it passes upwards,
and, finally, reaching the lower border of the pons, it becomes
slightly constricted and disappears from view by plunging into
that structure. The pyramids are the great motor strands of
the medulla oblongata.
Although the pyramid, at first sight, appears to be the
continuation upwards of the anterior funiculus of the spinal
medulla, it contains within itself only a very small proportion
of fibres which occupy that funiculus. This will be at once
manifest if the decussation of the pyramids is examined. For
this purpose introduce the back of the knife-blade into the
523
anteromedian furrow below the decussation, and on one side
push in a lateral direction the anterior funiculus of the medulla
spinalis. The pyramid will then be seen to divide into two
portions, viz., a small strand termed the fasciculus cerebro-
spinalis anterior (O.T. direct pyramidal tract), which proceeds
downwards into the anterior funiculus of the spinal medulla

close to the antero - median furrow, and a much larger
strand called the fasciculus cerebrospinalis lateralis (O.T.
crossed pyramidal tract), which, at this level, is broken up into
three or more coarse bundles which sink posteriorly and, at
the same time, cross the median plane to take up a position
in the opposite lateral funiculus of the spinal medulla, close
to the posterior column of grey matter. It is the inter-
crossing of the corresponding bundles of the fasciculi cerebro-
THE BRAIN
spinales laterales of opposite sides which produces this char
acteristic decussation.
But if the fasciculus cerebrospinal anterior of the anterior funiculus of
the spinal medulla is alone represented in the corresponding district of the
medulla oblongata, it may be asked: What becomes of the larger lateral part
of the anterior funiculus of the spinal medulla in the medulla oblongata? It
is thrust aside by the decussating bundles of the fasciculus cerebrospinalis
lateralis, and thus comes to occupy a deep position in the medulla oblongata.

Lateral Area of the Medulla Oblongata.—This is the
district on the surface of the medulla oblongata which is
included between the two rows of nerve fila, viz., the hypo-
glossal fila anteriorly, and the fila of the accessory, vagus, and
glosso-pharyngeal posteriorly. It presents a very different
appearance in its upper and lower parts. In its lower
portion it appears to the eye as a continuation upwards
of the lateral funiculus of the spinal medulla; in its upper
part is seen the striking oval prominence named the olive.
The lower part of this district, however, is very far from

being an exact counterpart of the lateral funiculus of the spinal
medulla. It has been noted already that the large fasciculus
cerebrospinalis lateralis, which in the spinal medulla lies
in the lateral funiculus, is not present in that district of the
medulla oblongata; above the decussation of the pyramids
it forms the chief part of the pyramid of the opposite side.

funiculus of the spinal medulla, gradually leaves this portion
of the medulla oblongata. This tract of fibres lies on the
surface, and it is often visible to the naked eye as a white
streak inclining obliquely into the posterior district of the
medulla oblongata to join its upper part, i.e., the restiform
body. The great majority of the remainder of the fibres
which are prolonged upwards from the lateral funiculus of
the spinal medulla disappear from the surface at the lower
border of the olive, by dipping into the substance of the
medulla oblongata under cover of that projection. A narrow
band, however, is carried upwards to the pons, in the interval
between the posterior border of the olive and the fila of the
vagus and glosso-pharyngeal nerves.
The olive is a smooth oval projection, which occupies
the upper part of the lateral area of the medulla oblongata.
Its long axis, which is vertical, is about half an inch long,
and its upper end is separated from the lower border of the
pons by an interval or groove.
Posterior Area of the Medulla Oblongata.—In its lower
half this region is formed by the cuneate and gracile funiculi;
and in its upper half it is formed, medially, by the ependymal
roof of the fourth ventricle and, laterally, by the diverging
funiculi.1 It is separated from the lateral area on each side
by the row of fila belonging to the accessory, vagus, and
glosso-pharyngeal nerves.
The lower part of the posterior area corresponds more or
less closely with the posterior funiculi of the spinal medulla.
It will be remembered that in the cervical part of the spinal
medulla the posterior areas on each side is divided by a
distinct septum of pia mater into a postero-median strand and
a postero-lateral strand. These are prolonged upwards into
the medulla oblongata, and in the lower part of the posterior
area they stand out distinctly, and are separated from each
other by a continuation upwards from the medulla spinalis
of the postero-intermediate sulcus. In the medulla oblongata
these strands receive different names. The medial one is called
the funiculus gracilis, whilst the lateral one is designated the
funiculus cuneatus. Each of these strands, when it reaches
the lower part of the fourth ventricle, ends in a slightly
expanded prominence. The swollen extremity of the
funiculus gracilis is called the clava; it is thrust aside from
its fellow of the opposite side by the opening up of the
central canal to form the fourth ventricle. The thickened
end of the cuneate funiculus receives the name of the
tuberculum cinereum, but it is in the young brain only that it
is well marked.
In sections through this region of the medulla oblongata,
it is seen that the prominences produced by the two strands
and their enlarged extremities are in a great measure due to the
1 The dissector should note that the lower part of the cavity of the hind-
brain, i.e. the fourth ventricle, is not behind but in the upper part of the
medulla, which it separates into dorsal and ventral parts; the dorsal part forms
a portion of the roof of the ventricle, whilst the ventral part forms a portion of
the floor.
527
presence of two elongated nuclei, which lie subjacent to
them and gradually increase as they are traced upwards.
These are termed the gracile and the cuneate nuclei, and it
can easily be shown that as the grey matter increases in
quantity the fibres of the two corresponding strands diminish
in number. Indeed, it is doubtful if any of their fibres are
prolonged upwards beyond the level of the nuclei.
But a third longitudinal elevation also is apparent in the
lower part of the posterior area of the medulla oblongata. This
is placed on the lateral side of the funiculus cuneatus—between
it and the posterior row of nerve fila—and it has no counter-
part in the posterior funiculus of the spinal medulla. It is
called the funiculus of Rolando, because it is produced by
the substantia gelatinosa Rolandi approaching the surface.
Extremely narrow below, the funiculus of Rolando widens
somewhat as it is traced upwards, and it, finally, ends in an
expanded extremity called the tubercle of Rolando. The thin
layer of fibres which appear on the surface of the tubercle
and funiculus of Rolando and cover the substantia gelatinosa
Rolandi in this position belong to the tractus spinalis (O.T.
spinal root) of the trigeminal nerve.
The restiform body forms the upper part of the posterior
area on each side. It lies between the lower part of the
floor of the fourth ventricle and the fila of the vagus and
glosso-pharyngeal nerves, and is thrust laterally by the en-
largement of the fourth ventricle. It is a large rope-like
strand, which inclines upwards and laterally, and then finally
takes a turn posteriorly, and enters the cerebellum, of which
it constitutes the inferior peduncle. The restiform body, there-
fore, is to be regarded as the main connection between the
cerebellum, above, and the medulla oblongata and medulla
spinalis below. At the same time, it must be understood
that it is not formed of fibres which are prolonged into it
from the funiculus gracilis and funiculus cuneatus of its
own side. It is true that a surface inspection of the
medulla oblongata might lead very naturally to this supposi-
tion, because there is no sharp line marking it off from the
tubercles of these strands.
The fibres which build up the restiform bodies come from several differ-
ent sources. It will be sufficient to indicate the more important of these—
(1) from the lateral funiculus of the spinal medulla through the fasciculus
cerebellospinalis; (2) from the cerebellum as the cerebello-olivary fibres
THE BRAIN
which go to the opposite inferior olivary nucleus; (3) from the cuneate
and gracile nuclei of both sides in the form of the arcuate fibres.
Fibrae Arcuate Externae.—On the surface of the medulla
oblongata, more particularly in the neighbourhood of the
lower border of the olive, a number of curved bundles of fibres,
termed the external arcuate fibres, may be noticed. They
vary greatly in number and in distinctness, and are some-
times so numerous as to cover the olive almost entirely.
An attentive examination will show that they come to the
surface in the antero-median fissure between the pyramids,
in the groove between the pyramid and the olive, and some-
times also through the substance of the pyramids. But at
whatever point they reach the surface, the majority have one
destination, viz., the restiform body—a considerable part of
which they form. They are derived from the cuneate and
gracile nuclei of the opposite side.
Dissection.—The pyramid of one side should now be carefully raised.
When dislodged from its bed it should be gently pulled upwards towards
the pons. In this way its entrance into the pons is brought very
clearly into view. Further, numerous arcuate fibres will be seen
running anteriorly upon the medial aspect of the opposite pyramid to
reach the surface, and the ventral edge of the medial lemniscus will be
exposed also.
Pons.—The pons is the marked prominence on the base
of the brain which is interposed between the medulla ob-
longata and the pe'dunculi cerebri, and lies anterior to the
cerebellum. It is convex from side to side, as well as antero-
posteriorly, and the transverse streaks on its surface show
that, superficially, it is composed of transverse bundles of
nerve fibres. On either side these transverse fibres collect
themselves together to form a large compact strand which
sinks postero-laterally into the corresponding hemisphere of
the cerebellum. This strand is termed the brachium pontis
(O.T. middle cerebellar peduncle).
The ventral surface of the pons is in relation to the basilar
portion of the occipital bone and the dorsum sellae of the
sphenoid bone. It presents a median groove which gradually
widens as it is traced upwards (Fig. 219). The groove
lodges the basilar artery, but is not caused by that vessel;
it is due to the prominence produced, on either side, by
the passage downwards through the pons of the bundles
of fibres which form the pyramids of the medulla oblongata.
CEREBELLUM
529
Where the pons becomes the brachium pontis the large
trigeminal nerve will be seen entering its ventral surface,
nearer its upper than its lower border.
With the exception of the restiform bodies, the whole of the
medulla oblongata enters the lower aspect of the pons, and its
constituent parts are carried upwards within it. The pedunculi
cerebri emerge from its upper aspect. The dorsal surface of
the pons cannot be studied at present. It is turned towards
the cerebellum, which hides it from view, and it forms the upper
part of the anterior boundary or floor of the fourth ventricle.
Cerebellum.—The cerebellum is distinguished by the
numerous parallel and more or less curved sulci which
traverse its surface and give it a foliated appearance. As in
the case of the cerebral hemispheres, the grey matter is
spread over the entire surface, whilst the white matter forms
a central core in the interior.
The cerebellum consists of a median portion, the vermis,
and two lateral hemispheres. The distinction between these
main subdivisions of the organ is not very evident on its
superior surface. Anteriorly and posteriorly there is a
marked deficiency or notch in the median plane (Fig. 223).
The posterior notch is smaller and narrower than the anterior
notch. It is bounded laterally by the posterior parts of the
cerebellar hemispheres, and anteriorly by the vermis, and
it is occupied by the falx cerebelli. The anterior notch is
much wider and, when viewed from above, it is seen to be
occupied by the inferior pair of quadrigeminal bodies and
the brachia conjunctiva cerebelli. Its sides are formed by
the lateral hemispheres, and the posterior end is bounded by
the vermis.
On the superior surface of the cerebellum there is little
distinction to be noted between the vermis and the upper
surface of each lateral hemisphere. The upper surface of
the vermis forms a median elevation, from which the surface
slopes gradually downwards, on each side, to the margin
of the hemisphere. On the upper surface of the vermis four
regions are recognised. Anteriorly, at the posterior end of
the anterior notch, lies the central lobe, and prolonged up-
wards from it on the dorsal surface of the anterior medullary
velum, between the brachia conjunctiva, are a few folia which
constitute the lingula. Posterior to the central lobe is the
monticulus, separable into two parts—an anterior elevated end,

the oilmen, and a posterior sloping ridge, the declive. Posterior
to the declive, in the anterior boundary of the posterior notch,
lies a single folium called the folium vermis.
On the inferior surface of the cerebellum, the distinction
between the three constituent parts of the organ is much
better marked. On that aspect the hemispheres are full,
prominent and convex, and they are separated by a deep,
median hollow which is continued forwards from the posterior
notch. This hollow is termed the vallecula cerebelli, and in its an-
terior part the medulla oblongata is lodged. If the medulla is
forced away from the cerebellum, and the lateral hemispheres
are pulled apart so as to expose the upper boundary of the
vallecula, it will be seen that this is formed by the inferior
surface of the vermis, and, further, that the vermis is separated,
on each side, from the corresponding lateral hemisphere by a
distinct furrow, termed the sulcus vallecula.1
If the margin of the vermis, where it forms the posterior
boundary of the anterior notch on the superior aspect of
the cerebellum, is gently raised, and at the same time the
mesencephalon is pulled anteriorly, two strands lying upon
the dorsal aspect of the pons will be seen. These are
the brachia conjunctiva cerebelli (O.T. superior peduncles).
They emerge from the white matter of the cerebellum,
converge as they proceed upwards, and, finally, they dis-
appear under the inferior quadrigeminal bodies. The thin
lamina which is stretched across between them is the anterior
medullary velum. It is continuous below with the white core
of the vermis, and it helps to form the roof of the upper
part of the fourth ventricle. From its dorsal surface, close
to the inferior quadrigeminal body, the small trochlear nerves
emerge.
Certain of the sulci which traverse the surface of the
cerebellum, deeper and longer than the others, map out
districts which are termed lobes. The most conspicuous of
all these clefts is the great horizontal sulcus.
Great Horizontal Sulcus of the Cerebellum.—The great
horizontal sulcus begins anteriorly, and passes round the
circumference of the cerebellum, cutting deeply into its lateral
and posterior margins. Anteriorly, its lips diverge from each

boundary of the fourth ventricle will be displayed.
other so as to embrace the large brachia pontis (O.T. middle
peduncles), where they pass into the interior of the cere-
bellum. The great horizontal sulcus divides the cerebellum
into an upper and a lower part, which may be studied
separately.
Lobes on the Upper Surface of the Cerebellum.—It has been noted
already that the upper surface of the vermis superior is subdivided. The
divisions commencing from the anterior end are :—(1) the lingula; (2) the
central lobule; (3) the culmen monticuli; (4) the declive monticuli; (5) the
folium vermis. With the exception of the lingula, each of these is continuous

on either side with a corresponding district on the upper surface of the hemi-
sphere, and forms with these districts a cerebellar lobe. Thus, the central
lobule is prolonged laterally on each side in an expansion called the ala;
the culmen constitutes a median connecting piece between the two anterior
crescentic lobules of the hemispheres ; the declive stands in the same relation
to the posterior crescentic lobules; and the folium vermis is the connecting
band between the superior semilunar lobules of the hemispheres.
Lingula.—The lingula can be seen only when the posterior boundary of
the anterior notch is pushed posteriorly. It consists of four or five small
folia, continuous with the grey matter of the vermis, prolonged anteriorly
on the surface of the anterior medullary velum, in the interval between
the brachia conjunctiva.

end of the anterior notch, and is largely hidden by the culmen. It is a
little median mass which is prolonged laterally for a short distance round
the semilunar notch in the form of two expansions, termed the alee.
Lobus Culminis.—The culmen monticuli constitutes the summit or
highest part of the monticulus of the vermis. It is prolonged laterally on
either side into the corresponding hemisphere as the anterior crescentic
lobule. This is the most anterior subdivision on the upper surface of the
hemisphere. The two anterior crescentic lobules, with the culmen
monticuli, form the lobus culminis cerebelli,

which it is separated by a distinct fissure, and it forms the sloping part or
descent of the monticulus of the vermis. On each side it is continuous
with the posterior crescentic lobule of the lateral hemisphere, and the three
parts are included under the one name of lobus clivi.
The two crescentic lobules on the upper surface of the hemisphere are
frequently described together as the quadrate lobule.
Lobus Semilunaris Superior (O.T. lobus cacuminis).—The folium
vermis forms the most posterior part of the superior portion of the
vermis, and it bounds the great horizontal fissure, superiorly, at the
posterior notch. It is a single folium, the surface of which may be
smooth or beset with rudimentary secondary folia, and it is the connecting
lirjk between the two superior semilunar lobules of the hemispheres^
533
the three parts constituting the lobus semilunaris superior. As the folium
vermis is traced laterally into the semilunar lobule of the hemisphere,
it is found to expand greatly. The result of this is that the lobus
semilunaris superior on each side forms an extensive foliated district
bounding the posterior part of the great horizontal sulcus superiorly.
Lobes on the under surface of the Cerebellum.—The connection
between the several portions of the inferior part of the vermis, and the
corresponding districts on the under surface of the two hemispheres is not
nearly so distinct as in the case of the superior part of the vermis and the
lobules on the upper surface of the hemispheres.
Proceeding postero-anteriorly the following subdivisions of the inferior
part of the vermis are recognised—(1) the tuber vermis, (2) the pyramid,
(3) the uvula, and (4) the nodule.
On the under surface of the hemisphere there are five lobules mapped
out by intervening sulci. These are—(1) the flocculus, a little lobule lying
on the brachium pontis; (2) the biventral lobule, which lies immediately

Tuber

posterior to the flocculus, and is partially divided into two parts by a fissure
which traverses its surface; (3) the tonsil, a rounded lobule, which bounds
the vallecula on the medial side of the biventral lobule; (4) the inferior
semilunar lobule, placed posterior to the biventral lobule, and bounding the
great horizontal sulcus inferiorly.
These lobules of the hemispheres, with the corresponding portions of
the inferior part of the vermis, constitute the lobes on the under aspect of
the cerebellum.
Lobus Noduli.—The lobus noduli comprises the nodule and the flocculus
of either side with an exceedingly delicate connecting lamina of white
matter, termed the posterior medullary velum.
The velum cannot be properly seen at present, but it will be exposed at
a later stage of the dissection.
Lobus Uvulae.—The uvula is a triangular elevation placed between the
two tonsils. It is connected across the sulcus valleculae with each tonsil
by a low-lying ridge of grey matter which is scored by a few shallow
furrows, and in consequence termed the furrowed band. The two tonsils
and the uvula form the lobus uvula.
To see the furrowed band it will be necessary to remove the tonsil on
one side, when the posterior medullary velum also will be exposed.
THE BRAIN
Lobus Pyramidis.—The pyramid is connected with the biventral
lobule on each side by a faint ridge which crosses the sulcus vallecula;.
The term lobus pyramidis is given to the three lobules which are thus
associated with each other.
Lobus Tuberis.—The tuber vermis, which forms the most posterior part
of the vermis, is composed of several folia, which run directly into the
inferior semilunar lobule on each side. The three parts of the lobus tuberis
are thus linked together. The inferior semilunar lobule is traversed by
two, or it may be three, curved fissures. The most anterior of these cuts
off a narrow, curved strip of cerebellar surface called the lobulus gracilis.
Dissection.- A median section should now be made through the vermis
of the cerebellum and the two medullary vela into the cavity of the fourth
ventricle. When the two parts of the cerebellum are drawn slightly
asunder, a view of the fourth ventricle is obtained; further, the connections
of the two medullary vela and the arrangement of the peduncles of the
cerebellum can be more clearly understood.
Arbor Vitae Cerebelli.—-The cut surface of the cerebellum
presents a very characteristic appearance. The grey matter
on the surface stands out distinctly from the white matter in
the interior. Further, the complete manner in which the
surface is cut up by the sulci into secondary and tertiary folia
is seen. The central mass of white matter in the vermis is
termed the corpus medullare. From this, prolongations pass
into the various lobules, and these give off branches to supply
each folium with a central white stem or core. The term
arbor vittz is applied to the appearance which consequently
results when a section is made through the cerebellum.
Cerebellar Peduncles.—The cerebellar peduncles are the
structures which connect the cerebellum with the medulla
oblongata, the pons and the mid-brain. They are three in
number on each side—viz., the middle, the superior, and
the inferior. They are all directly connected with the white
medullary centre of the cerebellum, and are composed of
fibres which emerge from or enter the white central sub-
stance of the organ.
The middle peduncle is the brachium pontis, and is much
the largest of the three. It is formed by the transverse
fibres of the pons, and it enters the cerebellar hemisphere on
the lateral side of the other two. The lips of the anterior
part of the great horizontal sulcus are separated widely from
each other to give it admission.
The inferior peduncle is simply the restiform body of the
medulla oblongata. Leaving the dorsum of the medulla
oblongata it turns sharply posteriorly and enters the cerebellum
between the other two peduncles.
MEDULLARY VELA
535
The superior peduncles are the brachia conjunctiva of
the cerebellum. They are composed of fibres which come, for
the most part, from the nucleus dentatus of the cerebellar
hemisphere. As they issue from the cerebellum, the
peduncle lies close to the medial sides of the corresponding
middle peduncles. They then proceed upwards towards the
inferior pair of quadrigeminal bodies. At first they form the
lateral boundaries of the upper part of the fourth ventricle,
but they converge, as they ascend on the dorsal aspect of the
pons, so that ultimately they overhang the fourth ventricle
and enter into the formation of its roof. They disappear
under cover of the quadrigeminal bodies, and their course
in the mesencephalon has been described already (p. 511).
Medullary Vela.—The medullary vela are closely associated
with the peduncles. They consist of two thin laminae of
white matter which are projected out from the white central
core of the cerebellum. The anterior medullary velum stretches
across the interval between the two brachia conjunctiva
(superior peduncles), with the medial margins of which it is
directly continuous. It is triangular in form, and is con-
tinuous below with the white matter of the cerebellum.
Spread out on its dorsal surface is the tongue-shaped prolonga-
tion of grey matter from the cortex of the cerebellum which
is termed the lingula, and issuing from its substance, close
to the inferior quadrigeminal bodies, are the two trochlear
nerves.
The posterior medullary velum is somewhat more complicated
in its connections. It presents the same relation to the
nodule that the anterior velum presents to the lingula. It is
a wide thin lamina of white matter—so thin that it is
translucent-—which is prolonged out from the white centre
of the cerebellum above the nodule. From the nodule it
stretches laterally to the flocculus, thereby bringing these
two small portions of the cerebellum into association with
each other. Where it issues from the white matter of the
cerebellum it might almost be said to be in contact with the
anterior medullary velum, but as the two laminae are traced
anteriorly they diverge from each other: the anterior velum is
carried upwards between the brachia conjunctiva of the cere-
bellum, whilst the posterior medullary velum turns downwards,
round the nodule, and ends in a slightly thickened free
crescentic edge. The cavity of the fourth ventricle is carried
THE BRAIN
posteriorly between the two vela, which form a tent-like roof
for it.
Isthmus Bhombencephali.—If the dissectors examine the
rhombencephalon from the side they will recognise that there
is a region below the lamina quadrigemina and above the
cerebellum which is bounded dorsally by the anterior
medullary velum, laterally by the brachia conjunctiva, and
ventrally by the upper part of the pons; it is to this region
that the term isthmus rhombencephali is applied. It contains
the upper part of the fourth ventricle.
Ventriculus Quart us.—This cavity is somewhat rhomboidal
in form. Below, it tapers to a point and becomes continuous
with the central canal of the lower part of the medulla
oblongata; above, it narrows in a similar manner and is
continued into the aquseductus cerebri of the mid-brain.
The anterior wall is termed the floor, and is formed by the
dorsal surface of the ventral part of the upper portion of
the medulla oblongata and by the dorsal surface of the pons.
The posterior wall is called the roof. On either side a
narrow pointed prolongation of the ventricular cavity is
carried laterally, from its widest part, round the upper part
of the corresponding restiform body. This is termed the
lateral recess (Fig. 222, p. 525). It is seen to the greatest
advantage when the cerebellum is divided in the median
plane and the halves are turned aside.
The lateral boundary of the fourth ventricle, on each side,
is formed, from below upwards, by the clava, the upper part
of the funiculus cuneatus, the restiform body or inferior
peduncle of the cerebellum, the brachium pontis or middle
peduncle of the cerebellum, and the brachium conjunctivum
or superior peduncle of cerebellum.
Dissection.—On one side cut through the brachium conjunctivum, the
brachium pontis and the restiform body, and so separate one lateral half of
the cerebellum, which must be laid aside for the present but must be preserved
for future use.
When the dissection is completed the dissectors will be
able to recognise that the anterior part of the cavity of the
fourth ventricle is rhomboidal in form. It constitutes the so-
called rhomboidal fossa, which is surrounded by the lateral
boundaries of the ventricle and closed anteriorly by the pons
and the posterior surface of the ventral part of the upper
portion of the medulla oblongata. Only the lower part of the
FOURTH VENTRICLE
537
rhomboidal fossa lies in the medulla oblongata; the inter-
mediate part is in the metencephalon, that is, it lies anterior
to the cerebellum and posterior to the lower part of the pons;
and the upper part is in the isthmus rhombencephali.
The lower part of the rhomboidal fossa is triangular in out-
line, and its inferior angle is continuous with the central canal
of the lower part of the medulla oblongata. The anterior
boundary or floor of this part of the fossa is marked by a
number of converging sulci, and is called the calamus
scriptorius. Along the lateral margins of the lower part of
the fossa will be seen the remains of the torn epithelial roof
of the lower part of the fourth ventricle. These torn margins
are the teenia of the fourth ventricle. The intermediate part of
the rhomboidal fossa is separable into a lower wider part,
which is prolonged laterally, on each side, below and posterior
to the restiform body, as the lateral recess of the fourth
ventricle. The upper section of the intermediate part of
the fossa is bounded laterally by the brachia pontis and is
much narrower than the lower part. The upper part of the
rhomboidal fossa lies posterior to the pons and between the
brachia conjunctiva. At its upper end it becomes continuous
with the aquaeductus cerebri of the mid-brain.
The floor, or anterior boundary, of the fossa rhomboidalis is
the floor, or anterior boundary, of the fourth ventricle. In
the upper part of its extent it is formed by the posterior
surface of the pons, and in the lower part by the posterior
surface of the ventral part of the upper portion of the medulla
oblongata. It is divided into lateral portions by a median
sulcus which is deeper below, in the region of the calamus
scriptorius, and shallower above. On each side of the median
sulcus is the eminentia medialis. In the upper part of the
fossa the eminentia medialis occupies practically the whole
of each lateral half of the floor; in the upper part of the
intermediate portion of the fossa a nodular eminence, the
colliculus facialis, appears on its surface; below the colliculus
it narrows rapidly, and it terminates, below, in a pointed tri-
angular process called the trigonum hypoglossi. The medial
eminence is bounded laterally by a sulcus, the sulcus limitans.
In the upper region, along the lateral border of the sulcus
limitans, is a narrow bluish tinted area called the locus
cceruleus; the colour of this area is due to a subjacent col-
lection of pigmented cells which constitute the substantia
THE BRAIN
ferruginea. Opposite the colliculus facialis the sulcus limitans
expands into a shallow fossa, the superior fovea. The lower
end of the sulcus limitans terminates, in the upper part of
the inferior section of the rhomboidal fossa, in a definite
depression, the inferior fovea. To the lateral side of the
superior and inferior foveae and the intermediate part of the
sulcus limitans is the area acustica, which is prolonged laterally
into the lateral recess where, in rare cases, a projection, the
tuberculum acusticum, appears on its surface. Below the
inferior fovea, between the trigonum hypoglossi medially and
the area acustica laterally, lies a depressed, grey-coloured,
triangular area called the ala cinerea, which is separated from
the lower part of the floor, the area postrema, by a raised
bundle, the funiculus separans. Immediately above the in-
ferior fovea a number of ridges, the medullary stria (O.T. strice
acustica), cross the floor of the fossa. Laterally they cross
the restiform body, at the lateral border of the fossa, and
become continuous with the cochlear root of the acustic
nerve; and medially they disappear into the median sulcus.
The roof of the fourth ventricle is formed, in the upper area,
by the medial parts of the brachia conjunctiva and the inter-
vening anterior medullary velum. Descending upon the
latter, from above, is the frenulum veli; and issuing from it, in
the same region, are the rootlets of the trochlear nerves.
The lower part of the upper portion of the roof is covered
by the lingula of the cerebellum. The roof of the inter-
mediate section of the ventricle is the white matter of the
vermis of the cerebellum, and the roof of the lower part is
epithelial ependyma and the obex.
The tela chorioidea of the fourth ventricle is the layer of
pia mater which covers and strengthens the epithelial roof of
the lower part of the cavity. Between it and the epithe-
lium at the lower end of the roof, is a thin layer of grey
matter, called the obex. Above, at the posterior medullary
velum, the tela becomes continuous with the pia mater on
the lower surface of the vermis of the cerebellum. Laterally
the tela is prolonged, on each side, posterior to the restiform
body, over the lateral recess, and it forms the stronger part
of the wall of that expansion. Between the medial part of
the tela chorioidea of the fourth ventricle and the pia mater
on the lower surface of the vermis of the cerebellum lies the
cisterna cerebello-medullaris (O.T. cisterna magna).
NUCLEUS DENTATUS
539
Apertures in the Tela Chorioidea of the Fourth Ventricle.—
In the early stages of development the tela chorioidea and
ependyma form an unbroken layer, but at a later period they
are perforated by three apertures. One of the apertures, the
apertura medialis ventriculi quarti (O.T. foramen of Magendie),
lies immediately above the obex, at the lower angle of the
ventricle, and through it the cavity of the fourth ventricle
communicates with the cerebello-medullary portion of the
subarachnoid space. The other two apertures lie at the
apices of the lateral recesses, immediately posterior to the
fila of the glossopharyngeal nerves.
Chorioid Plexuses of the Fourth Ventricle.—The chorioid
plexuses are vascular invaginations of the ependyma beneath
the tela chorioidea. In the lower part of the ventricle
they form two parallel bands, one on each side of the median
plane, and their lower ends project through the medial aper-
ture. At the upper part of the tela chorioidea they com-
municate together, and then each passes laterally into the
corresponding lateral recess and their lateral extremities
project through the lateral apertures.
Dissection.—The dissector should now introduce his fingers into the
great horizontal sulcus of that half of the cerebellum which is still connected
with the medulla oblongata and the pons, and tear the upper part of this
side of the organ away from the lower part. By this proceeding the
manner in which the peduncles enter the white medullary centre, and
also to some extent the general distribution of their fibres, will be seen.
When these have been demonstrated this half of the cerebellum should also
be separated by cutting through the peduncles at the points where they
enter the central white matter. A horizontal section may then be made
through the other half of the organ, rather nearer its upper surface than
its lower surface. This will reveal the nucleus dentatus.
Nucleus Dentatus of the Cerebellum.—This is a collection
of grey matter, embedded in the white medullary centre of
the lateral hemisphere of the cerebellum. It presents an
appearance very similar to a nucleus which lies in the olive of
the medulla oblongata. It is a thin lamina of grey matter,
which appears on section as a wavy line folded upon itself,
so as to form a crumpled grey capsule with a mouth open
towards the median plane. The greater number of the fibres
which build up the brachium conjunctivum issue from its
mouth.
There are other smaller isolated nuclei of grey matter in the white
medullary centre of the cerebellum, but these cannot, as a rule, be
THE BRAIN
demonstrated in a specimen obtained in the dissecting-room. They lie
nearer the median plane.
D1ssection.—A series of transverse sections should now be made
through the pons and the medulla oblongata, in order that something of
their internal structure may be learned.
As a matter of fact little of the structure of the medulla oblongata can be
learnt from specimens obtained in the dissecting-room; but in sections
properly prepared and stained a number of important points can be
seen.
Structure of the Medulla Oblongata.—When transverse sections are
made through the medulla oblongata at different levels, a faint line, called
the median raphe and occupying the median plane, is seen to divide it
Gracile nucleus

Fasciculus anterior proprius
F1g. 226.—Section through the lower part of the

into two exactly similar lateral portions. The raphe is formed by the
close intersection of fibres running in different directions.
Each half of the medulla oblongata is composed of (a) strands of white
matter; (6) grey matter, which is present both in the form of direct con-
tinuations into the medulla oblongata of portions of the grey matter of
the spinal medulla, and in the form of isolated clumps, which are not
represented in the spinal medulla; and (c) the formatio reticularis, a
substance which is composed of grey matter coarsely broken up by fibres
which traverse it in different directions. The white matter, as in the
spinal medulla, is disposed for the most part on the surface and the grey
matter in the interior, but in the open part of the medulla oblongata the
grey matter comes to the surface on its dorsal aspect, and forms the
obex (p. 538).
When the grey matter of the spinal medulla is traced up into the medulla
oblongata, many striking changes in its arrangement become apparent.
Owing to the increase in size of the large wedge-shaped gracile and cuneate
funiculi, the posterior columns of grey matter become pressed laterally, so
that they soon assume a position at right angles to the median plane, and
lie very nearly in the same transverse line. At the same time, the cuneate

neck of the posterior column, so as to reach the raphe. The caput
columme is in this way cut off from the basal portion. The basal portion
remains in close relation to the central canal, whilst the caput and
substantia gelatinosa (Rolando) is placed close to the surface, enlarges as it
is traced upwards, and forms the prominence on the surface which has been
described already as the funiculus and tubercle of Rolando. The fibres
which have thus broken up the neck of the posterior column, and which
come from the cuneate and gracile nuclei, are termed the internal arcuate
fibres. They reach the raphe on the deep or dorsal aspect of the pyramids,
and, in the median plane, they form a very complete decussation with the
corresponding fibres of the opposite side. This decussation is termed the
decussation of the lemniscus or the sensory decussation. As soon as they
reach the opposite side of the medulla oblongata, the internal arcuate

fibres turn upwards and form a longitudinal tract called the lemniscus.
It is placed close to the raphe and on the dorsal aspect of the corresponding
pyramid.
The anterior column of grey matter shares a like fate in the medulla
oblongata, but at a lower level, at the hands of the fasciculus cerebro-
spinalis lateralis (O.T. crossed pyramidal tract). This great bundle, in
passing from the pyramid into the lateral funiculus of the opposite side of
the spinal medulla, traverses the anterior column, completely breaks up
its intermediate part and separates its head from its basal portion. The
further history of the detached head need not be traced, but it is well
to note that the basal part of the anterior column of grey matter remains
in position on the ventral and lateral aspect of the central canal.
At a higher level the central canal, surrounded by the basal portions of
the two columns of grey matter, gradually inclines towards the dorsal aspect,
until it reaches the surface. The grey matter which surrounds it is now
spread out on the floor of the fourth ventricle, and in such a manner that
the portion which corresponds to the basal part of the anterior column of the
spinal medulla is situated close to the median plane, whilst the part which
represents the base of the posterior column occupies a more lateral position.
Therefore the nucleus of origin of the hypoglossal nerve is placed in the
median part of the floor, whilst the nucleus of termination of the vagus
and glosso-pharyngeal nerves lies in the lateral part of the floor.
The most conspicuous of the isolated clumps of grey matter in the
medulla are the olivary nucleus and the two accessory olivary nuclei. The
olivary nucleus lies subjacent to the olivary eminence, and is a very con-
spicuous object in transverse sections through this region. In such sections,
it presents the appearance of a thick wavy or undulating line of grey matter,
folded upon itself so as to enclose a space filled with white matter and open

towards the median plane. It is in reality a lamina arranged in a purse-
like manner with its open mouth directed towards the raphe.
The accessory olivary nuclei are two band-like laminae of grey matter,
which are placed one on the dorsal and one on the medial aspects of the
main nucleus.
Posterior to, or deeper than, the olive and pyramid is the formatio
reticularis of the medulla oblongata. It is divided into a lateral and a
medial field by the fila of the hypoglossal nerve as they traverse the sub-
stance of the medulla oblongata to reach the surface. In the lateral portion,
which lies posterior to the olive, there is a considerable quantity of grey
matter, continuous with that of the spinal medulla; it is therefore called
the formatio grisea. In the medial part, however, which lies posterior
to the pyramid, the grey matter is extremely scanty, and the reticular
matter here is termed the formatio alba.
THE BRAIN
The nerve fibres which traverse the formatio reticularis run both in the
transverse and in the longitudinal direction. The transverse fibres are the
internal arcuate fibres. The longitudinal fibres are derived from different
sources in the two fields. In the lateral part of the formation they represent
the fibres of the lateral funiculus (after the removal of the cerebello-spinal
and the lateral cerebro-spinal fasciculi), which are continued up under cover
of the olive. In the medial part, or formatio alba, two longitudinal strands
take origin, viz., the lemniscus and the median longitudinal fasciculus.
Both lie close to the raphe. The lemniscus is placed immediately posterior
to the pyramid, and is formed by the internal arcuate fibres after their
decussation. The median longitudinal fasciculus takes form in the upper
part of the medulla oblongata, immediately subjacent to the grey matter

of the floor of the fourth ventricle. It is formed by longitudinal fibres of
the formatio alba which come from the fasciculus anterior proprius of the
spinal medulla.
Internal Structure of the Pons.—When transverse sections are made
through the pons, it is seen to consist of two well-defined parts, viz., a
ventral and a dorsal. Broadly speaking, the ventral part, pars basalts,
corresponds to the pyramidal parts of the medulla, and the basal parts of
the pedunculi cerebri; whilst the dorsal pari corresponds to the formatio
reticularis of the medulla oblongata and the tegmental parts of the pedunculi
cerebri.
The basal part of the pons is the larger of the two subdivisions. It
is composed of a large number of transverse bundles of fibres, through
the midst of which coarse longitudinal bundles of fibres proceed down-
wards from the bases of the pedunculi cerebri to form, in the medulla
oblongata, the two pyramids. Scattered amongst these transverse and
longitudinal bundles of fibres, and filling up the interstices between them,
INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF PONS 545
there is a large amount of grey matter which forms the nuclei pontis. Of
the transverse fibres two distinct sets may be recognised, viz., the superficial
transverse fibres, through the midst of which the bundles of cerebro-spinal
fibres are prolonged, and a deeper set termed the corpus trapezoidum. The
superficial transverse fibres traverse the entire thickness of the ventral part
of the pons, and on each side, pass into the corresponding brachium pontis.
The trapezial fibres lie posterior to the cerebro-spinal bundles in the boundary
area between the dorsal and ventral parts of the pons, but encroaching con-
siderably into the ground of the former. They are seen only in the lower
part of the pons, and they pass into the lateral lemniscus. They take origin
in the terminal nucleus of the cochlear division of the acustic nerve.
The dorsal or tegmental part of the pons is, for the most part, formed
of a prolongation upwards of the formatio reticularis of the medulla.
Superiorly it is carried into the tegmental parts of the pedunculi cerebri.
It is divided into two lateral parts by a median raphe, which is continuous
below with the raphe of the medulla oblongata and above with the raphe of
the tegmental part of the mesencephalon, whilst over its dorsal surface is
spread a thick layer of grey matter which belongs to the upper part of the
floor of the fourth ventricle. In transverse sections through the pons a
dark spot in the lateral part of the floor indicates the position of a small
mass of pigmented cells called the substantia ferruginea. It underlies
the locus cceruleus.
Four strands of longitudinal fibres are seen on each side in transverse
sections through the dorsal part of the pons. These are (1) the medial
lemniscus, (2) the lateral lemniscus, (3) the medial longitudinal bundle, and
(4) the brachium conjunctivum.
The medial lemniscus assumes in the pons a ribbon-shaped form. It is
placed between the ventral part of the pons and the formatio reticularis
of the dorsal part.
The lateral lemniscus, largely composed of fibres derived directly or in-
directly from the corpus trapezoidum, is seen in the upper part of the pons.
It sweeps round the lateral side of the brachium conjunctivum to gain the
surface.
The medial longitudinal bundle is much more distinct than it is lower
down in the medulla oblongata. It has separated itself more completely
from the longitudinal fibres of the formatio reticularis, and it is now seen,
close to the median plane, immediately subjacent to the grey matter of
the floor of the fourth ventricle.
The brachium conjunctivum, in transverse sections, presents a semi-
lunar outline. It occupies a lateral position in the dorsal part of the
pons, and gradually sinks deeply into its substance, although it does not
become completely submerged until it reaches the mesencephalon.
The superior olive is a small isolated clump of grey matter which
is embedded in the dorsal part of the pons in the path of the corpus
trapezoidum.

546 THE AUDITORY APPARATUS
THE AUDITORY APPARATUS.
The organ of hearing admits of a very natural subdivision
into three parts, viz., the external, the middle, and the
internal ear. The external ear consists of the auricle and
the external acustic meatus. The auricle collects the waves
of sound, and is, comparatively speaking, of subsidiary im-
portance in man, although it is highly developed and of
considerable service in some of the lower animals. The
external acustic meatus is a passage leading inwards from
the bottom of the concha to the membrana tympani, which
separates the external from the middle ear. The middle ear
is a narrow chamber termed the tympanic cavity. It is inter-
posed between the external acustic passage and the internal
ear or labyrinth, and the main part of its lateral wall is formed
by the membrana tympani. Stretching across the cavity of
the tympanum, from its lateral to its medial wall, there is a
chain of three small bones, called the auditory ossicles. The
internal ear or labyrinth is a most essential part of the organ.
It consists of a complicated system of cavities situated in the
densest part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. These
cavities contain fluid called perilymph, and also a membranous
counterpart of the bony chambers, called the membranous
labyrinth. Within the latter there is fluid termed endolymph.
Dissection.—The dissection of the ear should be conducted differently
on opposite sides.
On one side remove the lateral pterygoid lamina and the remains of the
external and internal pterygoid muscles, if that has not been done already.
Then clear away the tensor palati muscle and expose the lateral surface of
the auditory tube. Dissect on the postero-medial aspect of the tube and
expose the levator palati muscle from the lateral side. Follow the muscle
downwards and medially, below the lower orifice of the tube, into the
soft palate. Then detach the auditory tube from the posterior border
of the medial pterygoid lamina; cut the levator palati, at the point
where it enters the soft palate, and separate the cartilaginous part of the
auditory tube from any parts of the wall of the pharynx which may still be
connected with it. When this has been done turn to the temporal bone;
place the saw at right angles to the external surface of the squamous part
and saw through the bone, along the line of the petro tympanic fissure, to the
posterior border of the spine of the sphenoid. Turn next to the medial
surface and saw through the body of the sphenoid at the level of the anterior
boundary of the foramen lacerum; then, with the aid of the chisel and bone
forceps, detach the posterior border of the great wing of the sphenoid from
EXTERNAL MEATUS

the anterior angle of the petrous part of the temporal bone. When the
dissection is properly clone the greater part of the temporal bone is removed
from the remainder of the skull, with the cartilaginous part of the auditory
tube attached to the anterior angle of its petrous portion, and a small part
of the body of the sphenoid bone attached to its apex. The anterior wall
of the mandibular fossa was separated by the first saw cut, and the posterior
wall is exposed, with the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube attached to
its medial end and the cartilaginous part of the external acustic meatus to
its lateral border. The dissector should now cut away the tragus of the
auricle, to expose the orifice of the external meatus which lies at the bottom
of the concha; then, with knife or scissors, he must remove the anterior

wall of the cartilaginous part of the external meatus. Next pass a probe
into the bony part of the meatus to gauge its length, and, whilst the probe
is kept in position as a guide, cut away the anterior wall of the bony
part of the meatus, taking care not to injure the tympanic membrane which
closes the medial end of the meatus. When the dissection is completed the
boundaries of the meatus and the outer surface of the tympanic membrane
should be examined.
Meatus Acusticus Externus.—The external acustic meatus
runs anteriorly and medially from its lateral orifice to its
medial boundary, and, during its course, it forms a slight curve
with the convexity upwards. Its total length, measured from
the bottom of the concha to the tympanic membrane, is about
24 mm., of which 8 mm. corresponds with the cartilaginous,
and 16 mm., with the bony part of the canal; but, as the
membrana tympani is placed obliquely, the anterior wall and
the floor are longer than the posterior wall and the roof,
respectively. Moreover, the diameter of the canal is not
uniform. It is narrowest at the isthmus, which lies about
5 mm. from the tympanic membrane ; and its vertical diameter
is greatest at the lateral end, whilst its antero-posterior
diameter is greatest at its medial end. These facts must
be borne in mind during the removal of foreign bodies which
have made their way into the canal. As the tube passes from

the surface medially it describes a gentle sigmoid curve, but
its general direction is towards the median plane with a
slight inclination anteriorly. The skin lining the cartilaginous
portion is abundantly furnished with ceruminous glands and
is provided also with laterally directed hairs, which tend to
prevent the entrance of dust. The cutaneous lining of the
osseous part, which is thin and tightly adherent to the
subjacent periosteum, is destitute of hairs, and glands are for
the most part absent. The cutaneous lining of the meatus is
continued in the form of an exceedingly delicate layer over
the outer surface of the membrana tympani.
MEMBRANA TYMPANI
549
When the direction, the length, and the diameters of the
external meatus have been noted, the dissectors should
examine the lateral surface of the tympanic membrane.
Membrana Tympani.—The slope of the tympanic mem-
brane has already been referred to. It slopes very obliquely
downwards, anteriorly and medially, and it is deeply concave
externally. The deepest point of the concavity is the umbo,
which corresponds with the lower end of a bar of bone, the
handle of the malleus, which is embedded in the membrane
and can be seen through the thin layer of tissue covering
it. The handle of the malleus extends upwards, and
slightly posteriorly, from the umbo towards the roof of the
meatus; and a short distance from the upper margin of
the membrane it becomes continuous with a small laterally
directed process, the lateral process of the malleus, which bulges
the membrane towards the meatus. Above the lateral process
of the malleus is a portion of the membrane which is less
tense than the remainder. This is the membrana flaccida
(Shrapnell's membrane). It is bounded anteriorly and
posteriorly by relatively thickened folds, the anterior and
posterior tympano-malleolar folds. The whole of the peripheral
margin of the membrane, except that which corresponds
with the membrana flaccida, is lodged in a ring-like sulcus
of bone, the annulus tympanicus, which is formed by the
tympanic element of the temporal bone.
Dissection. —After the examination of the external meatus is completed
the dissector must secure the tensor tympani muscle, which springs from the
anterior aspect of the petrous part of the temporal bone, close to the apex
and above the level of the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube. Having
secured it, he must trace it laterally, above the auditory tube, to the point
where it passes into the bony canal through which it enters the tympanum.
Then he must cut away the antero-lateral wall of the cartilaginous part of
the auditory tube, from the pharyngeal orifice to the upper extremity, and
pass a probe through the bony part of the tube into the tympanum. He
should next turn to the anterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal
bone and, with chisel and bone forceps, carefully remove the tegmen
tympani and expose the tympanic cavity from above. The dissection must
be carried anteriorly into the auditory tube and posteriorly into the tympanic
antrum. As the dissection is carried anteriorly a narrow margin of bone
must be left along the anterior border of the tympanic membrane, and care
must be taken to avoid injury to the tendon of the tensor tympani, which
emerges from the extremity of its bony canal, near the medial wall of the
tympanum, and crosses the cavity to be inserted into the malleus. The
chorda tympani nerve, which passes anteriorly, close to the tympanic
membrane and above the tendon of the tensor tympani, must also be
preserved if possible.
Tympanic Cavity or Middle Ear.—-The tympanic cavity
is a small chamber, filled with air, which is placed between
the bottom of the meatus externus and the internal ear or
labyrinth. Posteriorly it communicates, by a relatively large
orifice, with the tympanic antrum and mastoid air-cells;
whilst anteriorly the auditory tube opens into it and puts it
into connection with the cavity of the pharynx. It con-
tains the chain of auditory ossicles which crosses from its
lateral to its medial wall, and it is lined with delicate mucous
membrane.
The vertical depth and the antero-posterior length of the
tympanic cavity are each about half an inch (12.5 mm.).
Its width, from side to side, is about
a sixth of an inch (4.5 mm.); and,
as both its lateral and medial walls
bulge into the cavity, its width in
the centre is still further reduced.
The tympanic cavity consists of (1)
an upper part, which extends up-
wards beyond the level of the mem-
brana tympani, and to which the
term recessus epitympanicus is ap-
plied; and (2) the tympanum proper,
which lies immediately to the inner
side of the membrana tympani.
The tympanic cavity presents for
examination a roof and a floor,
with four walls, viz., anterior, pos-
terior, lateral, and medial.
The roof is composed of a thin plate of bone termed the
tegmen tympani. This separates it from the middle fossa
of the cranium. In chronic inflammatory conditions of the
middle ear, an extension of the inflammatory process to the
meninges of the brain is always to be feared.
The floor or jugular wall is narrow, and is also formed by
a thin osseous lamina, which is interposed between the
tympanum and the jugular fossa. It separates the tympanum
from the bulb of the internal jugular vein, and an exten-
sion of an inflammatory condition of the middle ear, through
the bone to the vein, may lead to thrombosis.
The posterior or mastoid wall presents, in its upper part,
the opening or aditus which leads from the recessus epi-

tympanicus into the tympanic antrum, and below this, close
to the medial wall, is a small hollow conical projection termed
the pyramid. This is perforated, on its summit, and the
aperture leads into a canal which curves posteriorly and then
downwards until it opens into the lower part of the last
stage of the canalis facialis. The curved canal of the pyramid
lodges the stapedius muscle, the delicate tendon of which
enters the tympanic cavity through the aperture on the
summit of the pyramid. Lateral to the pyramid is the aper-

ture on the posterior wall called the apertura tympanica cana-
liculi chorda through which the chorda tympani nerve enters
the tympanum.
The anterior wall is narrow, because the medial and lateral
walls converge anteriorly. The upper part of this wall is
occupied by the opening of the tensor tympani canal; the
intermediate part by the tympanic orifice of the auditory tube;
and the lowest part is a lamina of bone which separates the
tympanic cavity from the carotid canal. The tympanic end
of the septum between the auditory tube and the tensor
tympani canal, the processus cochlear if or mis, serves as a pulley

round which the tendon of the muscle turns abruptly, in a
lateral direction, towards the malleus.
The medial wall, which intervenes between the tympanum
and the labyrinth, presents certain important points for study.
The greater part of this wall bulges laterally, into the cavity,
in the form of a very evident elevation termed the promontory.
Above the posterior part of the promontory there is an oval
foramen, the fenestra vestibuli. Its long axis is directed
antero-posteriorly, and it opens into the vestibular part of

F1g. 236.—Left Membrana Tympani and Chain of Tympanic Ossicles

the labyrinth in the macerated bone, but is closed in the
recent state by the footpiece of the stapes, the most medial
of the auditory ossicles. The pyramid, on the posterior wall,
is immediately posterior to the fenestra vestibuli. Above the
fenestra vestibuli, in the angle formed by the meeting of
the roof and medial wall of the tympanum, and there-
fore in the recessus epitympanicus, is an antero- posterior
ridge. This is produced by the canalis facialis bulging into
the tympanum. The wall of the canal is very thin, and
allows the white colour of the facial nerve, which is contained
within the canal, to be readily seen. Below the posterior
end of the promontory is the fenestra cochlea, an aperture
553
which, in the macerated bone, leads into the cavity of the
cochlea, but, in the recent state, it is closed by a membrane
which is stretched across it, and receives the name of the
secondary membrane of the tympanum.
The lateral wall of the tympanic cavity is formed by the
membrana tympani and the squamous part of the temporal bone.
Membrana Tympani.-—The membrana tympani is an
elliptical disc of membrane which is stretched across the
medial end of the meatus acusticus externus, and it forms the
greater part of the lateral wall of the tympanum. It is placed
very obliquely; its lower and its anterior borders both inclining
medially.

in which the tympanic membrane is subdivided arbitrarily into four areas
or quadrants. (Howden.)
Its mode of attachment deserves some attention. At the
medial end of the meatus a ring-like ridge of bone, very
distinctly grooved, forms, as it were, a frame in which the
membrane is set. But this ridge is deficient above, where
the extremities of the bony ridge are separated by a deep
notch (the notch of Rivinus). This notch is occupied by a
portion of the membrane which is not so dense in its texture
(seeing that the fibrous layer is absent), and not so tightly
stretched as the remainder; consequently it receives the name
of the membrana flaccida (ShrapnelPs membrane). The edge
of that part of the membrane which is fixed in the circular
bony groove, sulcus tympanicus, is thickened, and at the notch
of Rivinus it is carried down, anterior and posterior to the
membrana flaccida, in the form of two bands, called respec-
tively the anterior and posterior tympano-malleolar folds.
The membrana tympani is composed of three layers—viz.,
an external cuticular layer, an intermediate fibrous lamina,
and an internal mucous layer. The handle of the malleus is
intimately connected with the fibrous layer, and is covered
medially by the mucous layer. It draws the membrane
towards the tympanic cavity, and is the cause of the concavity
on the outer surface. The deepest point of this concavity

F1g. 238.—Vertical section through the Left Ear: postero-medial half

corresponds with the flattened extremity of the handle of
the malleus, and is termed the umbo.
In examining the living ear, with a speculum, the surface of the mem-
brane appears highly polished, and a cone of light extends downwards
and forwards from the tip of the handle of the malleus. A pair of striae
(Prussak's striae), which correspond to the anterior and posterior tympano-
malleolar folds, extend from the processus lateralis of the malleus to the
margins of the notch of Rivinus, and thus map out the membrana flaccida.
The long crus of the incus can be faintly seen through the membrana
tympani, parallel with and posterior to the handle of the malleus.
Antrum Tympanicum.—The tympanic antrum is a recess
or air-chamber, in the petrous part of the temporal bone, with a
AUDITORY OSSICLES
555
diameter of about one-third of an inch. It is placed posterior
to the tympanum, and communicates by a relatively large
opening, the aditus, with the upper part of that cavity. It
lies at a depth of about half an inch from the surface of the
skull in the adult, but in the child it is placed much more
superficially. It is lined with mucous membrane, which is
continuous with the lining membrane of the tympanum. The
mastoid portion of the temporal bone also is occupied by air-
spaces, the air-cells, which may
extend downwards into the mas-
toid process. They are continu-
ous with one another and with
the tympanic antrum, and are
lined by a continuation of the
same mucous membrane.
Tympanic Mucous Membrane.
—The tympanum is lined
throughout with a thin mucous
membrane which is continuous
with the mucous membrane of
the pharynx. As already men-
tioned, it forms the innermost
layer of the membrana tympani,
and it is prolonged posteriorly
into the tympanic antrum and
mastoid air-cells. It covers the
ossicles also, and it invests the
tendons of the stapedius and
tensor tympani muscles.
Ossicula Auditus.—The audi-
tory ossicles are the malleus, the incus, and the stapes.
The malleus presents a head, a neck, a manubrium
two processes termed the processus lateralis and the pro-
cessus anterior. The head is large and rounded. It is
directed upwards, and lies above the level of the mem-
brana tympani, in the recessus epitympanicus, close to the
roof of the tympanum. On its posterior aspect there is
a notch-like articular surface, for articulation with the body
of the incus. The manubrium is attached to the fibrous
layer of the membrana tympani. The processus lateralis (O.T.
brevis) is a stunted projection which springs from the root of
the manubrium. It is directed laterally, and abuts against the

The processus anterior (O.T. gracilis) is a slender spicule of
bone which passes anteriorly into the petro-tympanic fissure.

which the roots are very divergent. It presents a body and
a long and a short crus. The body is provided with an
articular surface, which looks anteriorly and articulates with
the head of the malleus. The short crus is directed posteriorly,
557
and its extremity is attached, by ligaments, to the posterior wall
of the tympanum, near the opening into the tympanic antrum.
The long crus proceeds downwards and medially, in a direction
nearly parallel to that of the manubrium of the malleus, but
more medial, and on a plane posterior to that process. On
its inferior extremity, which is bent medially, there is a small
knob of bone called the processus lenticularis. This articulates
with the head of the stapes.
The malleus and incus move together on an axis which is formed by
the processus anterior of the malleus and the crus breve of the incus.
The articular surfaces of the two bones are provided with peculiar catch-
teeth which interlock when the bones are performing their ordinary
movements. When, however, force is applied to the inner surface of
the membrana tympani, as, for instance, when the tympanum is inflated
through the auditory tube, the incudp - malleolar joint gapes and the
malleus moves by itself. Traction upon the
attachments of the stapes, through the incus, is
thus avoided. —Neck

The stapes is shaped like a stirrup,

separated by a slightly constricted neck

excavated by an articular cup for the
processus lenticularis of the incus. The crura are grooved
longitudinally on their concave sides (sulcus stapedis). The
posterior crus is more sharply curved than the anterior crus.
The base fits into the fenestra vestibuli and corresponds in
its outline with that aperture. Its lower border is straight,
whilst its upper border is curved.
Ligaments of the Auditory Ossicles.—In addition to the
delicate capsular ligaments, which surround the joints between
the auditory ossicles, there are certain bands which connect
the bones to the walls of the tympanum and serve to restrain
their movements.
In connection with the malleus there are (1) an anterior ligament which
passes from its anterior part, at the'root of the processus anterior, to the
anterior wall of the tympanum in the neighbourhood of the petro-tympanic
fissure; (2) a lateral ligament which extends from its lateral process to
the margin of the notch of Rivinus; and (3) a superior ligament which
connects the head with the roof of the tympanum.
The ligament of the incus binds the extremity of its short crus to the
posterior wall of the tympanum, whilst the annular ligament of the stapes
connects the margin of its base to the circumference of the fenestra vestibuli.
Tympanic Muscles.—These are two in number, viz., the
stapedius and the tensor tympani.
The stapedius occupies the interior of the pyramid and the
canal which curves downwards from it. The delicate tendon
of the stapedius enters the tympanum, through the aperture
on the summit of the pyramid, and is inserted into the
posterior aspect of the neck of the stapes. It is supplied by
a branch from the facial nerve.

F1g. 243.—Oblique section of a part of the Head showing the relation
of the Auditory Tube.
The tensor tympani arises from the upper part of the
cartilage of the auditory tube and from the contiguous parts
of the great wing of the sphenoid and the petrous part
of the temporal bone. From its origin it passes postero-
lateral!y, upon the processus cochleariformis and above the
osseous part of the auditory tube. In the tympanic cavity
the tendon turns at right angles, round the extremity of the
processus cochleariformis, and passes laterally, towards the
lateral wall of the tympanum, to its insertion into the upper
559
part of the medial surface of the manubrium of the malleus.
The tensor tympani receives its nerve of supply from the otic
ganglion.
Chorda Tympani Nerve.—The chorda tympani, which
traverses the tympanic cavity in close relation to the upper
part of the membrana tympani, is described on p. 546.

cavity and antrum and the mastoid cells. It consists of an
osseous and a cartilaginous portion. The osseous portion is
about half an inch in length. It is widest at its entrance
into the tympanum, and narrowest at its other end. The
cartilaginous portion is about an inch in length, and has been
already described on p. 383.
Dissection: Second Method.—On the opposite side the bony part of
the external meatus, the tympanic antrum, and the tympanic cavity should
be approached from the postero-lateral aspect. The dissection of the bone
should be carried out after the manner adopted by the surgeon when operat-
ing for the cure of extensive mastoid and middle ear disease, but, to
facilitate the dissection, and to gain better access to the bone, the auricle
may be removed by cutting through the cartilaginous part of the external
meatus.
After the auricle has been cut away clear all the soft parts, including
the periosteum, from the outer surface of the mastoid part of the temporal
bone, and identify (1) the supra-meatal triangle and the supra-meatal
spine, which lie at the junction of the superior with the posterior border
of the bony part of the external meatus, and (2) the temporal line
which passes, posteriorly and upwards, above the supra-meatal triangle.
The objects of the first stage of the dissection are (1) the removal of the
outer compact layer; (2) the opening up of the cancellous tissue of the
mastoid part of the temporal bone, and the exposure of the mastoid air-
cells and the cavity of the tympanic antrum, whilst, at the same time,
injury to the posterior wall of the bony part of the external meatus and
to the sigmoid part of the transverse sinus, which lies in a groove on the
inner aspect of the posterior part of the mastoid portion of the temporal
bone, is avoided. The tympanic antrum lies at the level of the supra-
meatal triangle, that is above and posterior to the external meatus, and

the temporal bone from the outer side. The arrow is passing through
the aditus from the tympanic antrum into the tympanic cavity.
about half an inch from the superficial surface of the temporal bone.
The dissection should be commenced above, below the temporal
line, and should be carried, anteriorly and medially, into the bone,
parallel with the posterior wall of the external meatus, until the tympanic
antrum is opened into. After the tympanic antrum has been identified,
the cancellous tissue of the anterior part of the mastoid area must be
gradually removed till the more medially situated and more compact
bone is exposed. When this stage of the dissection is completed, the
dissector should note the following points :—(1) In the anterior boundary
of the exposed area is the compact posterior wall of the bony part of the
external meatus. (2) Posteriorly is a broad projecting ridge indi-
cating the position of the groove which lodges the sigmoid part of the
transverse sinus. (3) At the upper and deeper part of the area are the
medial wall of the tympanic antrum and the aditus leading into the tym-
panic cavity. (4) The intermediate area is occupied by the remains of
the mastoid air-cells, which may extend downwards to the tip of the
mastoid process. They are continuous above with the cavity of the tympanic
TYMPANUM
antrum. (5) On the medial wall of the aditus and the anterior part of the
medial wall of the tympanic antrum is a horizontal ridge which indicates
the position of the lateral semicircular canal of the labyrinth, and, below
it, on the medial wall of the mouth of the aditus, is a vertical ridge
indicating the position of the canalis facialis, which lodges the important
facial nerve.
The next stage of the dissection consists in the removal of the posterior
wall of the external meatus, and the exposure of the outer surface of the
tympanic membrane (p. 549)- After the tympanic membrane has been
examined, a seeker should be passed through the aditus into the tympanic
cavity, and its handle should be allowed to rest on the lower part of the
exposed area; then, whilst the seeker remains in position, the remainder of
the posterior wall and the upper boundary of the external meatus, from
the level of the seeker to the level of the roof of the tympanic antrum, can

be cut away without fear of injury to any important structure. The
dissection should be completed by the removal of the tympanic membrane
and ossicles, and when this has been done a very complete view will be
obtained of the medial walls of the tympanic cavity, the aditus, and the
tympanic antrum. Anteriorly, on the medial wall of the tympanic cavity,
is the promontory, which marks the position of the first turn of the
cochlea. Above and posterior to the promontory is the fenestra vestibuli.
The fenestra cochleae lies at the lower and posterior part of the promontory,
in the anterior part of a recess called the fossula fenestrae cochleae. Above
the fenestra vestibuli is a ridge caused by the posterior horizontal part
of the canalis facialis; this becomes continuous, on the medial wall of the
aditus, with the vertical ridge which indicates the position of the vertical
part of the canal. Above the latter is the horizontal ridge due to the
lateral semicircular canal. The dissector should open the canalis facialis
to expose the facial nerve; then he should open the lateral semicircular
canal, and afterwards remove the bone above and posterior to it to
cxjiose the walls of the superior and posterior vertical semicircular canals
(Figs. 245, 246).
VOL. 11—36
INTRAPETROUS PART OF THE FACIAL NERVE
AND THE ACUSTIC NERVE.
The facial and acustic nerves have already been traced
into the internal acustic meatus (p. 215). The dissector
should now open up this meatus and follow the facial nerve
in its course through the petrous portion of the temporal bone.
The canal which it occupies is termed the canalis facialis
(O.T. aqueduct of Fallopius). It begins at the bottom of
the internal acustic meatus, and opens on the exterior of
the skull at the stylo-mastoid foramen. Between its com-
mencement and termination it pursues a complicated course,
and this, combined with the density of the bone, renders the
dissection very difficult.
Dissection.—On the side on which the middle ear has been opened from
the lateral aspect and the canalis facialis has already been partially opened
up, the dissector should complete the dissection of the intrapetrous part of
the facial nerve and should examine the acustic nerve.
Separate the temporal bone from the other cranial bones which still
adhere to it, and fix it in the natural position (in a vice if possible). Remove
the squamous portion by a horizontal saw cut at the level of the upper
surface of the petrous portion. Make a second horizontal saw cut, im-
mediately above the roof of the internal acustic meatus, and carry it
laterally into the tympanum, in which it should emerge immediately above
the already opened canalis facialis where the latter lies above the fenestra
vestibuli. Then, with the bone forceps or chisel, remove the remains of the
roof of the internal meatus and follow the facial nerve along the canalis
facialis to the hiatus canalis facialis, and so expose the ganglion geniculi.
Secure the branches which arise from the ganglion and then follow the nerve
posteriorly above the fenestra vestibuli. The greater part of the vertical
portion of the canal has already been opened from the lateral aspect; the
remainder can now be displayed by means of two saw cuts—(1) a frontal
section (vertical transverse) carried medially from the lateral surface of the
bone to the posterior border of the stylo-mastoid foramen; (2) a sagittal cut
(vertical antero-posterior) carried from the posterior surface of the bone to
meet cut (1). The portion of bone between the two cuts must then be
removed, and the dissection must be completed with bone forceps. Three
branches are given off in this part of the canal.
Intrapetrous Portion of the Facial Nerve.—As the facial
nerve traverses the petrous bone, it may be divided into four
stages, which differ from one another in the relations they
present and in the direction which they take. They are:—
1. A part within the internal acustic meatus.
2. A very short part which extends from the bottom of the internal
acustic meatus to the ganglion geniculi.
INTRAPETROUS PART OF FACIAL NERVE 563
3. A part which occupies that portion of the canalis facialis which runs
along the medial wall of the tympanic cavity.
4. A part which extends vertically downwards to the stylo-mastoid
foramen.
First Stage.—In the internal acustic meatus, the facial
nerve runs almost directly laterally in company with the
acustic nerve. In this stage of its course it lies in relation
to the upper and anterior part of the acustic nerve, and
its motor and sensory roots join. At the bottom of the
acustic meatus it enters the canalis facialis.

Second Stage.—The second part of the facial nerve is very
short. It runs laterally, with a slight inclination anteriorly,
between the vestibule and cochlea, and very soon ends in
the swelling termed the gang/ion geniculi.
Third Stage.—At the ganglion geniculi, the facial nerve
bends suddenly and proceeds posteriorly and slightly
THE AUDITORY APPARATUS
downwards in that portion of the canal which runs along
the upper part of the medial wall of the tympanic cavity,
immediately above the fenestra vestibuli (O.T. ovalis).
The first three portions of the facial nerve are nearly
horizontal, and pursue a somewhat V-shaped course. The
apex of the V is directed anteriorly, and corresponds to the
ganglion geniculi.
The fourth stage is vertical, and arches downwards, posterior
to the pyramid, to gain the stylo-mastoid foramen.
The branches which spring from or join the facial nerve
during its passage through the temporal bone are:—
1. The greater superficial petrosal nerve, '\
2. Communicating twig to the smaller superficial I from ganglion
petrosal, j geniculi.
3. External superficial petrosal nerve, J
4. Nerve to stapedius.
5. Chorda tympani.
6. Communicating twigs to the auricular branch of vagus.
The great superficial petrosal nerve has been examined
already (p. 212). Its origin from the ganglion geniculi of
the facial can now be seen.
The communicating branch to the small superficial petrosal
arises from the ganglion geniculi, and unites with the fibres
of the tympanic nerve which issue from the tympanic plexus.
The external petrosal nerve is not always present. It
joins the sympathetic plexus which accompanies the middle
meningeal artery.
The nerve to the stapedius muscle arises from the facial as
it arches downwards posterior to the pyramid. It enters the
base of the pyramid and thus reaches the stapedius muscle.
The communicating twigs to the auricular branch of the
vagus arise a short distance above the stylo-mastoid foramen.
Chorda Tympani.—The chorda tympani represents to a
large extent the sensory fibres set free from the trunk of
the facial nerve. It is the largest branch given off by the
facial during its passage through the canalis facialis. It takes
origin a short distance above the stylo-mastoid foramen, and
arching upwards and anteriorly, in a narrow canal in the
petrous portion of the temporal bone (the canaliculus chordae
tympani), it appears in the tympanum by passing through
the tympanic aperture of the canaliculus chordae below the
base of the pyramid, and close to the posterior margin of
ACUS'L'IC NERVE
565
membrana tympani. The bony tunnel which it occupies can
easily be opened up in a decalcified bone, but is somewhat
difficult to expose in the hard bone. After entering the
tympanum the chorda tympani runs anteriorly upon the upper
part of the membrana tympani under cover of the mucous
layer. It crosses the handle of the malleus on the medial
aspect near its root. Finally, reaching the anterior end of
the tympanic cavity it crosses the anterior process (O.T.
gracilis) of the malleus, passes above the tensor tympani, and
traverses the medial end of the petro-tympanic fissure, which
conducts it to the exterior of the skull. From this point to
its junction with the lingual nerve the chorda tympani has
already been traced (p. 278).
Acustic Nerve. — In the internal acustic meatus the
acustic nerve lies at a lower level than the facial, and at the
bottom of the passage it splits into two parts, termed the
cochlear and vestibular divisions. These trunks again sub-
divide and supply the different parts of the labyrinth of the
ear through the foramina of the lamina cribrosa.
After the examination of the intrapetrous part of the facial nerve and
the acustic nerve is completed the dissector should display the labyrinth
of the internal ear by means of two saw cuts—(1) an antero-posterior
vertical cut carried from the upper surface of the bone downwards to
the floor of the tympanum along the junction of its medial and posterior
boundaries; (2) a horizontal cut. This cut should be commenced at the
apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone and should be carried
laterally till it joins the vertical cut posteriorly, and enters the tympanic
cavity anteriorly at the level of the mid-height of the promontory.
When the upper part of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, separated
by the two cuts, is removed, the vestibular and cochlear parts of the
labyrinth and portions of the semicircular canals will be displayed. The
dissector should demonstrate the positions and curves of the semicircular
canals and the canalis facialis by passing bristles through them.
Auris Interna.—The internal ear or labyrinth consists of an
intricate system of cavities in the petrous part of the temporal
bone, the osseous labyrinth, and a series of hollow membranous
structures, connected with the filaments of the acustic nerve,
which lie in the osseous labyrinth and constitute the mem-
branous labyrinth.
The osseous labyrinth is composed of an intermediate
chamber termed the vestibule, posterior to which are placed
the three semicircular canals, whilst anteriorly is the cochlea.
All these cavities communicate with one another. The corre-
sponding membranous parts do not completely occupy the
n—36 a
THE AUDITORY APPARATUS
osseous chambers, and the intervening space is filled with a
fluid termed the perilymph. The membranous labyrinth also
contains a fluid which receives the name of endolymph.
Vestibulum.—The vestibule is a small ovoid bony chamber,
possessing an antero-posterior diameter of about one-sixth
of an inch. It is situated between the medial wall of the
tympanum and the bottom of the internal acustic meatus.
Into the posterior part of the vestibule the three semi-
circular canals open by five round apertures; whilst in its
lower and anterior part is the opening of the scala vestibuli
of the cochlea.
F1g. 348.—Interior of the Left Bony Labyrinth viewed from
the lateral aspect. (Howden.)
On the lateral wall is the fenestra vestibuli, which is closed,
in the recent state, by the delicate periosteal lining of the
chamber and the base of the stapes. When these parts are
removed, the vestibule communicates directly with the tym-
panum. On the-anterior part of the medial wall of the
vestibule there is a circular depression, termed the recessus
spharicus, which is bounded posteriorly by a vertical ridge,
called the crista vestibuli. The bottom of the recessus sphaericus
is perforated by some minute holes which give admission to
filaments from the acustic nerve. On the roofoi the vestibule
is another depression, named the recessus ellipticus. It is placed
posterior to the crista vestibuli.
A small aperture placed on the posterior part of the
medial wall also deserves mention. It is the mouth of the
aquaduclus vestibuli—a small canal which leads posteriorly to

the posterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone,
where it opens under the dura mater.
Canales Semicirculares Ossei.—These are three bony canals
or tubes placed posterior to the vestibule. They are bent
upon themselves, so that each forms considerably more than
half a circle, and they occupy planes at right angles to each
other like three faces of a cube. They are termed superior,
posterior, and lateral, and they open into the posterior part
of the vestibule by five round orifices, the number of openings
being thus reduced through the adjoining extremities of the
superior and posterior canals becoming fused together so as
to present a common canal, the crus commune, with a single
Superior semicircular canal

Lateral semicircular canal
F1g. 249.—Left Bony Labyrinth viewed from lateral side. (Howden.)
orifice. One extremity of each canal where it joins the
vestibule becomes expanded into what is termed its ampulla.
There are thus three ampullated ends.
The superior semicircular canal forms the highest part of
the labyrinth, and gives rise to a smooth elevation on the
anterior surface of the petrous part of the temporal bone,
immediately anterior to its superior angle. It is vertical,
and placed almost transversely to the long axis of the petrous
part of the temporal bone. The posterior semicircular canal,
which is the longest of the three tubes, is also vertical, and
lies in a plane parallel to the posterior surface of the petrous
part of the temporal bone. The lateral semicircular canal is
the shortest of the tubes, and it lies in a horizontal plane.
Cochlea.—The cochlea is a tapering tube which is coiled
spirally for two turns and a half around a central pillar, termed
the modiolus. The appearance produced is somewhat similar
to that of a spiral shell. The cochlea lies anterior to the
vestibule, with its base directed towards the bottom of the
internal acustic meatus; whilst its apex is directed antero-
laterally, and lies in close relation with the canal for the
tensor tympani muscle.
The cochlear tube rapidly diminishes in diameter as it
is traced towards the apex of the cochlea, and its closed
extremity is termed the cupola. The first turn which it
takes around the modiolus produces the bulging on the
medial wall of the tympanum, which has been described under
the name of the promontory.
The modiolus is thick at the base, but rapidly tapers
towards the apex. Its base abuts against the bottom of
the internal acustic meatus. It forms the inner wall of
the cochlear tube, and winding spirally round it, like the
thread of a screw, is a thin lamina of bone, termed the lamina
spiralis, which partially subdivides the tube into two passages.
Numerous minute canals traverse the modiolus, and one more con-
spicuous than the others, the longitudinal canal of the modiolus, extends
along its centre. The spiral lamina also is tunnelled by small canals
in communication with those in the modiolus, whilst one, the spiral
canal of the modiolus, winds spirally around the central pillar in the
attached margin of the spiral lamina. All these channels convey
filaments from the cochlear division of the acustic nerve to the membranous
cochlea, whilst the spiral canal lodges the ganglion spirale cochlea, which
is the peripheral ganglion of the cochlear part of the acustic nerve.
The membranous cochlear tube or ductus cochlearis is placed
between the free margin of the spiral lamina and the
opposite side of the wall of the cochlear tube, and completes
the subdivision of the bony cochlea into two compartments,
which are termed the scala tympani and the scala vestibuli.
The scala tympani is the larger of the two. It begins at the
fenestra cochleae, where the secondary membrane of the
tympanum shuts it off from the tympanic cavity. At the
apex of the cochlea it communicates with the scala vestibuli
by means of an aperture, termed the helicotrema. At the
base of the cochlea the scala vestibuli communicates with
the lower and anterior part of the vestibule. The perilymph
therefore, in the semicircular canals and vestibule, is
directly continuous with that in the scala vestibuli and
scala tympani.
569
It can now be understood how vibrations of the membrana tympani
are communicated to the perilymph within the osseous labyrinth. The
chain of auditory ossicles through the base of the stapes affects the
perilymph in the vestibule. The vibrations of the perilymph passing
along the scala vestibuli into the scala tympani in turn affect the secondary
membrane of the tympanum which is stretched across the fenestra cochleae.
With every inward movement of the membrana tympani and of the base
of the stapes, there is an outward movement of the membrane of the
fenestra cochlere, and vice versa. The vibrations of the perilymph affect
the endolymph in the membranous labyrinth, and thus excite the termina-
tions of the acustic nerve.

Membranous Labyrinth. — In the vestibule there are two mem-
branous sacs, termed the utricle and the saccule. The utricle occupies
the recessus ellipticus on the wall of the vestibule, and lies above and
posterior to the saccule. Into it open the membranous semicircular
canals.
The saccule is smaller, and occupies the recessus sphtericus on the anterior
part of the medial wall of the vestibule. It communicates by means of a
short narrow tube, termed the canalis reuniens, with the ductus cochlearis
or membranous cochlear tube.
The saccule and the utricle are only indirectly brought into communica-
tion with each other; a slender tube termed the ductus endolymphaticus
occupies the aquaeductus vestibuli, and divides into two branches which
pass respectively into the saccule and the utricle (Fig. 250).
The ductus cochlearis, or scala media, lies between the two scalae of the
cochlear tube. It ends blindly at each extremity, but close to its basal
end it is brought into communication with the saccule by the canalis
reuniens.
BULBUS OCULI
BULBUS OCULI.
The bulbus oculi or eyeball is not perfectly spherical; it may
be said to be composed of the segments of two spheres.
The anterior or corneal segment, forming only about one-sixth
of the entire eyeball, possesses a shorter radius than the pos-
terior or scleral segment. The anterior clear corneal part of
the eyeball forms, therefore, a dome-like bulging or prominence
on the front of the globe of the eye. The terms anterior
and posterior pole are respectively applied to the central points
of the anterior and posterior segments of the eyeball. The
imaginary line which joins these poles receives the name
of the sagittal axis, whilst another line drawn in a coronal
direction around the globe of the eye midway between the
two poles so as to divide the eyeball into two hemispheres
is termed the equator. Imaginary meridional lines also are
drawn between the two poles so as to cut the equatorial line
at right angles.
Dissection of the Eyeball.—A satisfactory dissection of the globe of the
eye can be made only when the eyeball is fresh, or after it has been
hardened for several days in a 10 % solution of formol. In the dissecting-
room it is often impossible to obtain suitable specimens; but it is always
easy to procure eyeballs of the pig, sheep, or ox, and these suit the purpose
admirably. It is advisable, however, that the dissector should complete
his study of the organ by the examination of a fresh human eyeball obtained
from the post-mortem room. In point of size, and also in other particulars,
the eyeball of the pig more closely resembles the human eyeball, but it
is perhaps better that the student should begin with the eyeball of the
ox, seeing that in it the dissection can be more easily carried out.
When the dissector has provided himself with six eyeballs obtained from
oxen, he should remove from them the conjunctiva, fascia bulbi, ocular
muscles, and fat, which adhere to them. Pinching up, with the forceps,
the conjunctiva and the fascia bulbi close to the corneal margin, he should
snip through these layers with the scissors and divide them round the
whole edge of the cornea. He can then easily strip all the soft parts
from the surface of the sclera, working steadily posteriorly towards the
entrance of the optic nerve. A little posterior to the equator of the
eyeball the vente vorticose will be noticed issuing from the sclera at wide
intervals from each other, and on approaching the posterior aspect of the
eyeball the posterior ciliary arteries and the ciliary nerves will be seen
piercing the sclera around the entrance of the optic nerve.
Before beginning the actual dissection of the eyeball, it is important
that the student should obtain a general conception of the parts which
compose it. This can be done by sections through three hardened speci-
mens in three different planes. One specimen may be divided at the
equator into an anterior and a posterior portion. Another may be divided

in an antero posterior direction into a medial and a lateral half. A third
should be divided horizontally and a portion of the vitreous body should be
removed (Fig. 251). When the sections are made, they should be placed
under water in a cork-lined tray, and preserved for reference as the study
of the eyeball is proceeded with.
General Structure of the Eyeball.—The eyeball consists
of three concentrically arranged coats enclosing a cavity in
which three refracting media are placed.
The tunics are: (1) an external fibrous envelope com-
posed of a posterior opaque part, called the sclera, and an

anterior clear transparent portion called the cornea; (2) an
intermediate vascular envelope known as the uveal tract, in
which three subdivisions are recognised, viz., a posterior part
called the chorioid, an anterior portion termed the iris, which
lies posterior to the cornea, and an intermediate ciliary body;
(3) the nervous internal tunic or retina, in which the fibres
of the optic nerve spread out.
The refracting media are: (1) posterior to the cornea a
watery fluid, called the aqueous humour, contained in a
space partially subdivided by the iris into the two chambers
of the eye; (2) the crystalline lens posterior to the posterior
BULBUS OCULI
chamber; and (3) the vitreous body, occupying the posterior
part of the interior of the eyeball.
Dissection.—The superficial surface of the sclera and the cornea
should now be examined; but to complete the study of the external tunic
a further dissection is required. Selecting an eyeball for this purpose, an
incision should be made, with a sharp knife, through the sclera at the
equator. This must be done carefully, and the moment that the sub-
jacent black chorioid coat appears the knife should be laid aside. The cut
edge of the sclera should now be seized with the forceps, and the incision
carried completely round the eyeball, with the scissors, along the line of the
equator. The outer fibrous tunic is thus divided into an anterior and
a posterior portion. These must now be raised from the subjacent parts.
As the anterior portion is turned anteriorly, some resistance will be met
close to the margin of the cornea from the attachment of the ciliary muscle
to the deep surface of the sclera. This can easily be broken through with
the blunt point of the closed forceps; as soon as this is done the aqueous
humour escapes. In the case of the posterior part of the sclera, its
complete separation can be effected by dividing the fibres of the optic
nerve close to the point where they appear through the sclera.
When the above dissection is successfully carried out, the outer fibrous
tunic is isolated in two portions, whilst a continuous view of the inter-
mediate vascular coat is obtained. The eyeball, denuded of its external
tunic, should now be placed in a shallow vessel filled with water.
Sclera.—The sclera is what is commonly known as the
white of the eye. It is a dense, resistant tunic, opaque-
white in colour, which envelops the posterior five-sixths of
the globe of the eye. It is thickest posteriorly, and becomes
thinner as it is traced anteriorly. Near the cornea, however,
it again becomes thicker, owing to the accession of fibres
which it receives from the tendons of the ocular muscles.
Except at the optic entrance and close to the margin of
the cornea, where it adheres to the surface of the subjacent
ciliary muscle, the deep surface of the sclera is very loosely
attached to the chorioid coat. Some pigmented flocculent
connective tissue, the lamina fusca, passes between the two
coats and traverses what is in reality an extensive lymph
space, termed the perichorioidal space.
The point at which the optic nerve pierces the sclera
does not correspond with the posterior pole of the eyeball.
The optic entrance, as it is termed, is situated about 3 mm. to
the medial or nasal side of the posterior pole and 1 mm.
below it. There the outer fibrous sheath of the optic
nerve, which is derived from the dura mater, blends with
the sclera, and the bundles of nerve fibres pass through a
series of small apertures. This perforated portion of the
sclera is called the lamina cribrosa.
CORNEA
573
The sclera is pierced also by numerous blood-vessels and nerves.
The long and short posterior ciliary arteries with the ciliary nerves
perforate the sclera around the optic entrance; four or five venae
vorticosae issue from the interior of the eyeball by piercing the sclera a
short distance posterior to the equator, at wide intervals from each other;
whilst the anterior ciliary arteries pierce it near the corneal margin.
Anteriorly the sclera is not only contiguous to, but is
directly and structurally continuous with, the cornea. This
is termed the corneoscleral junction, and the faint groove on
the surface, which corresponds with it, receives the name of
the scleral sulcus. At this junction the scleral tissue slightly
overlaps the corneal tissue, and the line of union, when

(After Testut, modified.)
seen in section, is oblique. Close to this a minute canal in
the substance of the sclera, termed the sinus venosus sclera
(O.T. canal of Schlemm), encircles the margin of the cornea.
Cornea.—The cornea forms the anterior sixth of the outer
tunic of the eye. It is transparent and glass-like, and it
forms the window through which the rays of light gain
admittance into the eyeball. The curvature of the cornea is
more accentuated than that of the sclera, and thus it consti-
tutes the segment of a smaller sphere. When viewed from
the posterior aspect it appears circular, but when looked at
from the front it is seen to be slightly wider in the transverse
direction. This is due to the fact that the sclera overlaps it
to a greater extent above and below than it does at the sides.
The posterior concave surface of the cornea forms the anterior
BULBUS OCULI
boundary of the anterior chamber of the eyeball, and is
separated by the aqueous humour from the anterior surface
of the iris.
The anterior convex surface of the cornea is clothed with
the conjunctiva, reduced to a transparent epithelial layer.
On its posterior aspect there is an elastic glassy stratum,
termed the posterior elastic lamina. When the cornea is
relaxed this membrane becomes wrinkled, and it can be
torn away in shreds from the proper corneal tissue.
Ligamentum Pectinatum Iridis.—At the margin of the
cornea the posterior elastic lamina is fibrillar, and some of
its fibres are continued into the iris, forming the ligamentum
pectinatum iridis, whilst others are prolonged posteriorly into
the chorioid and the sclera. The ligamentum pectinatum
iridis bridges across the angle between the cornea and the
iris, and the bundles of fibres into which the posterior elastic
lamina breaks up in this region constitute an annular mesh-
work or sponge-like series of minute spaces termed the spatia
anguli iridis (O.T. spaces of Fontana). These communicate
with the anterior chamber of the eyeball, and are filled with
aqueous humour.
Tunica Vasculosa Oculi.—The intermediate or vascular
tunic, frequently spoken of as the uveal tract, is exposed,
in its entire extent, in the eyeball from which the sclera
and the cornea have been removed. It is separable into
three parts—(1) a posterior portion, the chorioidea; (2)
an intermediate part, the corpus ciliare; and (3) an anterior
segment, the iris.
Chorioidea.—The chorioid is the largest part of the vas-
cular tunic. It lines the posterior segment of the eyeball,
between the sclera externally and the retina internally. It
is thickest posteriorly, where it is pierced by the optic nerve,
and becomes thinner anteriorly, as it approaches its union
with the ciliary body. Its superficial surface is connected
with the deep surface of the sclera by some lax connective
tissue, and also by blood-vessels and nerves which pass from
the one into the other. The deep surface of the chorioid is
moulded upon the retina and connected with a layer of
deeply-pigmented cells which usually adheres to the chorioid
when that tunic is removed, although in reality it is a portion
of the retina.
In the eyes of many mammals, but not in man, the posterior part of the
CILIARY BODY
575
chorioid, when viewed from the front, presents an extensive brightly-coloured
area, which exhibits a metallic lustre. This appearance is due to the
presence of an additional layer in the chorioid termed the tapetum. In
the horse, elephant, and ox, the tapetum is composed of fibres (tapetum
fibrosum); in carnivora, it is formed of cells (tapetum cellulosum). In the
ox, it is a brilliant green colour with a golden lustre; in the dog, it is white
with a bluish border; in the horse, it is blue with a silvery lustre.
The chief bulk of the chorioid coat is composed of blood-
vessels. These are arranged in two well-marked layers, viz.,
a deep, closely-meshed capillary layer called the lamina chorio-
capillaris, and a more superficial venous layer composed of

F1g. 253.—Dissection of the Eyeball showing the Vascular Tunic and
the Arrangement of the Ciliary Nerves and Vessels.
the vasa vorticosa. The short posterior ciliary arteries pass
anteriorly between these vascular layers.
The eyeball in which the outer surface of the chorioid is exposed should
be immersed in water and the; pigment washed out of it by means of a
camel-hair brush. The vasa vorticosa will then appear as white curved
lines converging towards four or five points, from which the venae vorticosae
take origin (Fig. 253).
Corpus Ciliare.—The ciliary body is separable into an
antero-external part, the orbiculus ciliaris, and a postero-
internal part, the corona'ciliaris.
The orbiculus ciliaris consists of the ciliary muscle, the
ganglionated ciliary nerve plexus, and plexuses of arteries
and veins associated with the iris and ciliary body. It is
BULBUS OCULI
continuous with the iris internally, the sclera anteriorly, and
the corona ciliaris and the chorioid posteriorly.
Ciliary Muscle.—This is composed of involuntary muscular
tissue, but the arrangement of its fibres can be seen only
when thin sections of the eyeball are examined under the
microscope. It is then obvious that the fibres are disposed
in two groups, viz., a radiating and a circular.
The radiating fibres arise from the deep aspect of the
sclera close to the margin of the cornea. From this
they radiate posteriorly, in a meridional direction, and gain
insertion into the chorioid coat in the region of the ciliary
processes. The circular fibres consist of two or three bundles
Ciliary foli

(Professor Arthur Thomson.)
placed upon the deep aspect of the radiating portion of the
muscle. They form a muscular ring around the outer circum-
ference of the iris.
Dissection.—To obtain a view of the ciliary processes, a frontal section
should be made through an eyeball a short distance anterior to the
equator. The portion of the vitreous body which occupies the posterior
segment of the eyeball should be carefully removed. When this is done,
the deep aspect of the corona ciliaris will be seen. It is covered with
ciliary processes which radiate posteriorly from the circumference of the
crystalline lens. By washing out the pigment from this part of the vascular
tunic, the arrangement of the processes will be displayed more fully.
A second dissection may be made in another eyeball with the object of
exposing the ciliary processes from the front. In this case remove the
cornea with the scissors by cutting round the corneo-scleral junction. The
iris is now brought conspicuously into view, and may, with advantage, be
studied at this stage. Several cuts in the meridional direction, and at
577
equal intervals from each other, should, in the next place, be made through
the anterior part of the sclera. The strips of sclera should then be
separated from the ciliary muscle, and pinned outwards in a cork-
lined tray filled with water. The last step in the dissection consists in the
removal of the iris. v
The corona ciliaris lies on the posterior aspect of the
orbiculus ciliaris and is continuous anteriorly with the
iris and posteriorly with the chorioid. It consists of a number
of larger folds, the processus ciliares, 70 to 72 in number, which
are intermingled with a number of smaller folds, the plica

ciliares. The ciliary processes extend from the anterior
margin of the chorioid to the anterior margin of the corona
ciliaris, where they end in bulbous extremities. The bulbous
ends occupy the space between the peripheral margin of the
iris and the margin of the anterior surface of the crystalline
lens, and they form the peripheral boundary of the posterior
chamber of the eyeball. The plica ciliares are much less
prominent than the ciliary process, and both the processes
and the folds are in relation posteriorly with the hyaloid
membrane, which separates them from the vitreous body,
and with the peripheral part of the zonula ciliaris to which
they are attached.
vol. 11—37
BULBUS OCULI
Iris.—The iris lies anterior to the crystalline lens, and it
is separated from the cornea by the anterior chamber filled
with aqueous humour. By its circumference it is continuous
with the ciliary body, and it is connected by the ligamentum
pectinatum iridis with the margin of the cornea.
The iris is circular in form, and has a central perforation
termed the pupil. Its anterior surface is faintly striated in a
radial direction. It is coloured differently in different
individuals. Its posterior surface is deeply pigmented.
The pupil presents a very nearly circular outline,1 and
during life it constantly varies in its dimensions so as to
control the amount of light which is admitted into the
interior of the eyeball. These changes in the size of the
pupil are produced by the two groups of involuntary "muscular
fibres which are present in the substance of the iris. One
group is composed of muscular f1bres arranged circularly
around the pupil in the form of a sphincter; the second
group consists of fibres which have a radial direction, and
pass from the sphincter towards the circumference of the
iris, so as to constitute a dilatator muscle. By some
anatomists these radial fibres are considered to be elastic
and not muscular.
Ciliary Nerves.—The ciliary nerves arise from the ciliary
ganglion and the naso-ciliary nerve. They pierce the sclera
around the optic entrance, and extend anteriorly, between
the sclera and the chorioid, in the perichorioidal lymph space.
They will be seen, in the specimen in which the sclera has
been turned aside in separate flaps, in the form of delicate
white filaments (Fig. 253). In the posterior part of the
eyeball they occupy grooves on the deep surface of the sclera,
and can be separated from it only with difficulty. Reaching
the ciliary zone the ciliary nerves break into branches, which
join in a plexiform manner and send twigs to the ciliary
muscle, the iris, and the cornea.
Ciliary Arteries. — There are three groups of ciliary
arteries:—(1) the short posterior ciliary arteries; (2) the long
posterior ciliary arteries; and (3) the anterior ciliary arteries.
The short posterior ciliary arteries, branches of the
ophthalmic, pierce the sclera around the optic entrance,
1 It may be as well to mention here that the pupil in the ox and the
sheep is greatly elongated in the transverse direction. In the pig, how-
ever, it is approximately circular.
RETINA
579
and are distributed in the chorioid coat between the vasa
vorticosa and the membrana chorio-capillaris.
The long posterior ciliary arteries, also branches of the
ophthalmic, are only two in number. They perforate the
sclera on either side of the optic nerve (Fig. 252), a short
distance beyond the short ciliary arteries, and then pass
anteriorly between the sclera and the chorioid. When
they gain the ciliary zone each artery divides into an
ascending and a descending branch, and these, with the
anterior ciliary arteries, form an arterial ring termed the
circulus iridis major. Branches are given off from this circle
to the ciliary muscle, the ciliary processes, and the iris.
The circulus iridis minor is the name applied to a second arterial ring
in the iris at the outer border of the sphincter pupillae.
The anterior ciliary arteries are very small twigs, which
arise from the branches of supply to the recti muscles.
They pierce the sclera close to the margin of the cornea,
take part in the formation of the circulus iridis major, and
send twigs to the ciliary processes.
Venae Vorticosae.—From each venous vortex in the
chorioid a large vein arises, which makes its exit from the
eyeball by piercing the sclera, obliquely, a short distance
posterior to the equator. They are four or five in number.
Dissection.—The vitreous body and retina, in the posterior part of the
eyeball which was cut into two for the purpose of exposing the ciliary
processes from the posterior aspect, should now be dislodged. By raising
the chorioid coat from the deep surface of the sclera, under a flow of
water from the tap, the venae vorticosae entering the deep surface of the
sclera will be brought into view. When these are divided, and the separa-
tion of the two coats is carried posteriorly towards the optic entrance, the
posterior short ciliary arteries, as they emerge from the sclera and enter the
posterior part of the chorioid, will be seen.
In the eyeball from which the sclera and cornea have been removed,
the iris, ciliary processes, and the chorioid should be carefully stripped-off
piecemeal under water. This will expose the retina.
Retina. — The retina is composed of two strata—viz., a
thin pigmentary layer, which adheres to the deep surface of
the chorioid coat, and has been removed with it, and a
delicate nervous layer, which is moulded on the surface of
the vitreous body, but presents no attachment to it except at
the optic entrance. The retina extends anteriorly, beyond
the equator of the eyeball, and, a short distance from the
ciliary zone, it appears to end in a well-defined wavy or
BULBUS OCULI
festooned border termed the ora serrata. This appearance,
however, is somewhat deceptive. The nerve elements, it
is true, come to an end along this line, but a lamina in
continuity with the retina is in reality prolonged antero-
medially as far as the margin of the pupil. The part in
relation to the ciliary processes is exceedingly thin, and
cannot be detected by the naked eye. It is termed the
pars ciliaris retina. The portion on the deep surface of the
iris is called the stratum pigmenti iridis.
During life the retina proper is transparent, but after death
it soon assumes a dull greyish tint and becomes opaque.
Posteriorly it is tied down at the optic entrance. When
viewed from the anterior aspect this appears as a conspicuous
circular disc termed the papilla nervi optici, upon which is
a depression, the excavatio papilla. From this spot the
optic nerve fibres radiate out so as to form the deep or
anterior layer of the retina. The optic disc, in correspond-
ence with the entrance of the optic nerve, lies to the medial
or nasal side of the antero-posterior axis of the eyeball.
Exactly in the centre of the human retina, and therefore in
the axis of the globe of the eye, there is a small yellowish
spot termed the macula lufea.1 It is somewhat oval in
outline, and a depression in its centre is called the fovea
centralis.
Retinal Arteries and Veins.—In a fresh eyeball the
arteria centralis retina will be seen entering the retina at
the optic disc. It immediately divides into a superior
and an inferior branch, and each of these breaks up
into a large lateral or temporal division, and a smaller
medial or nasal division. These ramify in the retina as far as
the ora serrata; but the resultant branches do not anastomose
with each other, nor with any of the other arteries in the
eyeball.
The retinal veins converge upon the optic disc, and
disappear into the substance of the optic nerve in the form
of two small trunks which soon unite.
The retinal vessels, the optic disc, and the macula can all be examined
in the living eye by means of the ophthalmoscope. The red reflex obtained
from the fundus of the eyeball is produced by the blood in the lamina
chorio-capillaris.
There is no macula lutea in the eyeball of the ox or sheep.
VITREOUS BODY
Dissection.—For the study of the vitreous body and the crystalline lens,
which together may be termed the "eye-kernel," it is better to take an
eyeball which is not perfectly fresh (Anderson Stuart). The. eyeball
selected for this purpose should be allowed to stand untouched from one
to three days, according to the season. The coats of the eye should then
be divided round the equator, and on gently separating the cut edges, and
turning the coats anteriorly and posteriorly, the " eye-kernel " will slip out.
It should be allowed to drop into a vessel filled with clean water. The
examination of the parts forming the '' eye-kernel" will be greatly facilitated
by placing it en masse in strong picro-carmine solution for a few minutes.
When removed from the staining fluid, it should be well washed in water.
In this way the hyaloid membrane enclosing the vitreous body, the capsule
of the lens, and the zonula ciliaris, are stained red, and their connections
become very apparent (Anderson Stuart).
Vitreous Body.—This is a soft, yielding, transparent,
jelly-like body, which occupies the posterior four-fifths of the
interior of the eyeball. The retina is spread over its surface
as far forwards as the ora serrata, but is in no way attached
to it, except at the optic disc. Anterior to the ora serrata,
the ciliary processes are applied to the vitreous body and
indent its surface. More anteriorly, the vitreous body pre-
sents a deep concavity, the fossa hyaloidea, for the reception
of the posterior convex surface of the crystalline lens.
The substance of the vitreous body is enclosed within a
delicate transparent membrane, which completely envelops
it, and receives the name of the hyaloid membrane. Extend-
ing anteriorly through the midst of the vitreous mass, from the
region of the optic disc to the crystalline lens, is a minute
canal, lined with a tube-like prolongation of the hyaloid
membrane, and containing a watery fluid. This is termed
the hyaloid canal; it represents the path taken by a branch of
the arteria centralis retina?, which, in the foetus, extends to and
supplies the capsule of the lens, but afterwards disappears.
The hyaloid canal, as a rule, cannot be seen in an ordinary dissection
of the eyeball; but if the " eye-kernel" be shaken up in the picro-carmine
solution as recommended by Anderson Stuart, it may sometimes be rendered
evident through the staining fluid entering it. It is represented diagram-
matically in Fig. 251.
Zonula Ciliaris (O.T. Zonula of Zinn). Between the
corona ciliaris externally and the margin of the lens internally
lies a fibrous membrane called the zonula ciliaris. Its
external margin is attached to the posterior surfaces of the
ciliary processes and the hyaloid membrane, and its internal
margin is connected with the lens. As it approaches the
margin of the crystalline lens, it splits into two parts, viz., an
BULBUS OCULI
exceedingly delicate deep lamina, which lines the fossa
hyaloidea, and a more superficial stronger part, which becomes
attached to the capsule of the crystalline lens.
The zonula ciliaris lies subjacent to the ciliary processes,
and is radially plaited or wrinkled in correspondence with
these. Thus the elevations or wrinkles of the zonula extend
into the intervals between the ciliary processes, whilst the
ciliary processes in their turn lie in the depressions between
the wrinkles of the zonula. When the eye is fresh, these
opposing parts are closely adherent.
The zonula ciliaris is strengthened by radially directed
elastic fibres, and after the delicate membrane which lines
F1g. 256.—Diagrammatic representation of the Ciliary Region,
as seen in vertical section.
the fossa hyaloidea is given off from its deep surface, it
extends inwards as a distinct layer, and is attached to the
anterior surface of the capsule of the lens a short distance
beyond the margin of that body. In this manner the
suspensory ligament of the lens is formed. But this is not
the only attachment of the suspensory ligament. Some
scattered fibres are attached to the circumference or equator
of the lens (equatorial fibres), whilst others are fixed to its
posterior surface close to its margin (post-equatorial fibres).
In this way the crystalline lens is firmly held in its place
in the fossa hyaloidea. Further, the degree of tension of its
suspensory ligament is influenced by the radiating fibres of
Retina

LENS
583
the ciliary muscle, which by their contraction pull upon the
ciliary processes, and produce relaxation of the zonula
ciliaris.
Spatia Zonularia (O.T. canal of Petit).—In reality the
spatia zonularia constitute a more or less continuous circular
lymph space, which surrounds the circumference of the lens.
It lies between the anterior and posterior layers of the
suspensory ligament and is filled with a watery fluid.
By introducing the point of a fine blow-pipe into the spatia zonularis
through the suspensory ligament, it can be partially, or, perhaps, com-
pletely, inflated with air. It then presents a sacculated appearance.
Dissection.—The crystalline lens may be removed by snipping through
the suspensory ligament with scissors.
Lens Crystallina.—The crystalline lens is a biconvex,
solid, and transparent structure which lies between the iris
and the vitreous body. It is enclosed within a glassy, elastic
capsule, to which the different parts of the zonula ciliaris
are firmly cemented, and it presents for study an anterior
surface, a posterior surface, and a circumference or equator.
The anterior surface is not so highly curved as the posterior
surface. Its central part, which corresponds with the pupillary
aperture of the iris, looks into the anterior chamber of the
eye. Around this part the margin of the pupillary orifice of
the iris is in contact with the lens, whilst nearer the equator
the anterior surface of the lens is separated from the iris by
the fluid in the posterior chamber of the eyeball. The posterior
surface of the lens presents a higher degree of curvature than
the anterior surface, and is received into the fossa hyaloidea
of the vitreous body. The equator or circumference is rounded.
It forms one of the boundaries of the spatia zonularia, and
the manner in which the zonula ciliaris is attached to the
capsule in this vicinity has been described already.
Faint radiating lines may be seen on both surfaces of the
lens. These give a clue to the structure of the lens. They
indicate the planes along which the extremities of the lens-
fibres come into apposition with each other.
The capsule of the lens is a resistant glassy membrane,
which is considerably thicker anteriorly than posteriorly.
The anterior wall of the capsule may now be divided with a sharp knife.
A little pressure will cause the body of the lens to escape through the
opening. The stained capsule can be very advantageously studied whilst
floating in water.
BULBUS OCULI
If the lens body is compressed between the finger and thumb, it will
be noted that the outer portion or cortical part is soft, whilst the central
part or nucleus is distinctly firmer. When the lens is hardened in alcohol
it can easily be proved that it is composed of numerous concentrically
arranged laminae.
Chambers of the Eyeball.—The anterior chamber of the
eyeball is the space between the cornea anteriorly, and the
iris and central part of the lens posteriorly. At the irido-
corneal angle it is bounded by the ligamentum pectinatum
iridis, and there the aqueous humour which fills this chamber
finds access to the spatia anguli iridis.
The posterior chamber is a circular space or interval which
is bounded anteriorly by the posterior surface of the iris, and
posteriorly by the circumferential part of the anterior face of
the lens. Externally, this space is closed by the thick anterior
projecting ends of the ciliary processes. It also is filled with
aqueous humour.
