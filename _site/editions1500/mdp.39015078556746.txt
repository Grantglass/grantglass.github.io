ROBINSON CRUSOE

INTRODUCTION.
THE AUTHOR of the perennial Robinson
Crusoe was born in London, England, in
1661. His father was a butcher, who edu-
cated his son for the ministry, among the
dissenters, but could never persuade him to pursue
that vocation.
He was remarkable for the versatility of his
mind, and for his wonderful fertility of invention,
and was a very voluminous writer, there being
about two hundred and ten of his works extant,
which, though chiefly fictious, produced a lively
impression of truth and reality.
3
4 INTRODUCTION.
His political works exposed him to much
suffering and pecuniary loss, which he summed
up in this couplet:
"No man has tasted differing fortunes more;
And thirteen times have I been rich and poor."
Sir Walter Scott says "Perhaps there exists no
work in the English language which has been
more generally read and more universally ad-
mired than the Adventures of Robinson Crusoe."
The illustrations by Walter Paget fit the text
excellently well. The story will no doubt find a
wide circulation, having been adapted to meet the
tastes of the youngest readers.

ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS born at York, in England, on the First
of March, 1632, which was the sixth year
of the reign of King Charles the First.
From the time when I was quite a young
child I had felt a great wish to spend my life at
sea, and as I grew, so did this taste grow more
and more strong; till at last I broke loose from
my school and home, and found my way on foot
to Hull, where I soon got a place on board a
ship.
6 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
When we had set sail but a few days, a squall
of wind came on, and on the fifth night we sprang
a leak. All hands were set to the pumps, but we
felt the ship groan in all her planks, and her beams
quake from stem to stern; so that it was soon
quite clear there was no hope for her, and that all
we could do was to save our lives.
The first thing was to fire off guns, to show that
we were in need of help, and -at length a ship,
which lay not far from us, sent a boat to our aid.
But the sea was too rough for it to lie near our
ship's side, so we threw out a rope, which the
men in the boat caught, and made fast, and by
this means we all got in.
Still, in so wild a sea it was vain to try to get
on board the ship which had sent out the men, or
to use our oars in the boat, and all we could do
was to let it drive to shore.
In the space of half an hour our own ship struck
on a rock and went down, and we saw her no
more. We made but slow way to the land, which
we caught sight of now and then when the boat
rose to the top of some high wave, and there we
saw men who ran in crowds, to and fro, all bent
on one thing, and that was to save us.
At last to our great joy we got on shore, where
we had the luck to meet with friends who gave us
the means to get back to Hull; and if I had now

I FELT THE WISH TO SPEND MY LIFE AT SEA
had the good sense to go home, it would have
been well for me.
The man whose ship had gone down said with
a grave look, "Young lad, you ought to go to sea
no more; it is not the kind of life for you." "Why,
sir, will you go to sea no more then?" "That is
not the same kind of thing. I was bred to the
sea, but you were not, and came on board my ship
just to find out what a life at sea was like, and
you may guess what you will come to if you do
not go back to your home. God will not bless
you, and it may be that you have brought all this
woe on us."
I spoke not a word more to him; which way
he went I knew not, nor did I care to know, for I
was hurt at this rude speech. Shall I go home,
thought I, or shall I go to sea? Shame kept me
from home, and I could not make up my mind
what course of life to take.
As it has been my fate through life to choose
for the worst, so I did now. I had gold in my
purse, and good clothes on my back, and to sea
I went once more.
But I had worse luck this time than the last, for
when we were far out at sea, some Turks in a
small ship came on our track in full chase. We
set as much sail as our yards would bear, so as to
get clear from them. But in spite of this, we saw
^
THE WALK BACK TO HULL
-
our foes gain on us, and we felt sure that they
would come up to our ship in a few hours' time.
At last they caught us; but we brought our
guns to bear on them, which made them sheer off
for a time, yet they kept up a fire at us as long
as they were in range. The next time the- Turks
came up, some of their men got on board our
ship, and set to work to cut the sails, and- do us
all kinds of harm. So as ten of our men lay.
dead, and most of the rest had wounds, we
gave in.
The chief of the Turks took me as his prize to
a port which was held by the Moors. He did
not use me so ill as at first I thought he would
have done, but he set me to work with the rest
of his slaves. This was a change in my life
which I did not think had been in store for me.
How my heart sank with grief at the thought of
those whom I had left at home, nay, to whom I
had not had the grace so much as to say "Good-
bye" when I went to sea, nor to give a hint of
what I meant to do!
Yet all that I went through at this time was
but a taste of the toils and cares which it has
since been my lot to bear.
I thought at first that the Turk might take me
with him when next he went to sea, and so I
should find some way to get free; but the hope
11
did not last long, for at such times he left me on
shore to see to his crops. This kind of life I led
for two years, and as the Turk knew and saw
more of me, he made me more and more free.

I WENT WITH HIM TO FISH
He went out in his boat once or twice a week to
catch a kind of flat fish, and now and then he
•
took me and a boy with him, for we were quick
at this kind of sport, and he grew quite fond of
me.
One day the Turk sent me in the boat to catch
some fish, with no one else but a man and a boy.
While we were out, so thick a fog came on, that
though we were not half a mile from the shore,
we quite lost sight of it for twelve hours; and
when the sun rose the next day, our boat was at
least ten miles out at sea. The wind blew fresh,
and we were all much in want of food; but at
last, with the help of oars and sail, we got back
safe to land.
When the Turk heard how we had lost our
way, he said that the next time he went out, he
would take a boat that would hold all we could
want if we were kept out at sea. So he had quite
a state room built in the long boat of his ship, as
well as a room for us slaves. One day he sent
me to trim the boat, as he had two friends who
would go in it to fish with him. But when the
time came they did not go, so he sent me with
the man and the boy—whose name was Xury—
to catch some fish for the guests that were to sup
with him.
Now the thought struck me all at once that this
would be a good chance to set off with the boat,
and get free. So in the first place I took all the
food that I could lay my hands on, and I told the
man that it would be too bold of us to eat of the
bread that had been put in the boat for the Turk.
He said he thought so too, and he brought down
a small sack of rice and some rusks.
While the man was on shore I put up some
wine, a large lump of wax, a saw, an axe, a spade,
some rope, and all sorts of things that might be
of use to us. I knew where the Turk's case of
wine was, and I put that in the boat while the man
was on shore. By one more trick I got all that I
had need of. I said to the boy, "The Turk's
guns are in the boat, but there is no shot. Do you
think you could get some? You know where it is
kept, and we may want to shoot a fowl or two."
So he brought a case and a pouch which held all
that we could want for the guns. These I put in
the boat, and then set sail out of the port to fish.
The wind blew from the north, or northwest,
which was a bad wind for me; for had it been
south, I could have made for the coast of Spain.
But, blow which way it might, my mind was made
up to get off, and to leave the rest to fate. I then
let down my lines to fish, but I took care to have
bad sport; and when the fish bit I would not pull
them up, for the Moor was not to see them. I
said to him, '' This will not do: we shall catch no
fish here; we ought to sail on a bit." Well, the
Moor thought there was no harm in this. He
set the sails, and, as the helm was in my hands,
I ran the boat out a mile or more, and then
brought her to, as if I meant to fish.
Now, thought I, the time has come for me to
get free; so I gave the helm to the boy, and then
took the Moor round the waist, and threw him
out of the boat.
Down he went! but soon rose up, for he swam
like a duck. He said he would go all around the
world with me, if I would but take him in.
I had some fear lest he should climb up the
boat's side, and force his way back; so I brought
my gun to point at him, and said, "You can swim
to land with ease if you choose; make haste then
to get there; but if you come near the boat you
shall have a shot through the head, for I mean to
be a free man from this hour."
He then swam for the shore, and no doubt got
safe there, as the sea was so calm.
At first I thought I would take the Moor with
me, and let Xury swim to land; but the Moor
was not a man that I could trust.
When he was gone I said to Xury, "If you will
swear to be true to me, you shall be a great man
in time; if not, I must throw you out of the boat
too."
The poor boy gave me such a sweet smile as
IF YOU COME NEAR THE BOAT I WILL SHOOT YOU
he swore to be true to me, that I could not find it
in my heart to doubt him.
While the man was still in view (for he was on
his way to the land), we stood out to sea with the
boat, so that he and those that saw us from the
shore, might think we had gone to the strait's
mouth, for no one went to the south coast, as a
tribe of men dwelt there who were known to kill
and eat their foes.
We then bent our course to the east, so as to
keep in with the shore; and as we had a fair wind
and a smooth sea, by the next day at noon we
were a long way off, and quite out of the reach of
the Turk.
I had still some fear lest I should be caught by
the Moors, so I would not go on shore in the day
time. But when it grew dusk we made our way
to the coast, and came to the mouth of a stream,
from which we thought we would swim to land,
and then look around us. But as soon as it was
quite dark we heard strange sounds—barks,
roars, grunts, and howls. The poor lad said he
could not go on shore till dawn. "Well," said I,
"then we must give it up, but it may be that in the
day time we shall be seen by men, who for all we
know would do us more harm than wild beasts."
"Then we give them the shoot gun," said Xury
with a laugh, "and make then run way."
WE WENT TO THE SPRINGS TO FILL OUR JARS 17
2—Robinson Crusoe
I was glad to see so much mirth in the boy,
and gave him some bread and rice.
We lay still at night, but did not sleep long,
for in a few hours' time some huge beasts came
down to the sea to bathe. The poor boy shook
from head to foot at the sight. One of these
beasts came near our boat, and though it was too
dark to see him well, we heard him puff and blow,
and knew that he must be a large one by the
noise he made. At last the brute came as near
to the boat as two oars' length, so I shot at him, and he swam to the shore.
The roar and cries set up by beasts and birds at
the noise of my gun would seem to show that we
had made a bad choice of a place to land on; but
be that as it would, to shore we had to go to find
some fresh spring, so that we might fill our casks.
Xury said if I would let him go with one of the
jars, he would find out if the springs were fit to
drink; and, if they were sweet, he would bring
the jar back full. "Why should you go?" said T;
"why should not I go, and you stay in the boat?"
At this Xury said, "If the wild mans come they
eat me; you go way." I could not but love
the lad for this kind of speech. "Well," said I,
"we will both go, and if the wild men come we
must kill them; they shall not eat you or me."
I gave Xury some rum from the Turk's case to
cheer him up, and we went on shore. The boy
went off with his gun, full a mile from the spot
where we stood, and came back with a hare that
he had shot, which we were glad to cook and eat;
but the good news which he had brought was that
he had found a spring, and had seen no wild men.
I made a guess that the Cape de Verd Isles
were not far off, for I saw the top of the Great
Peak, which I knew was near them. My one
hope was that if I kept near the coast, I should
find some ship that would take us on board; and
then, and not till then, should I feel a free man.
In a word, I put the whole of my fate on this
chance, that I must meet with some ship, or die.
On the coast we saw some men who stood to
look at us. They were black, and wore no
clothes. I would have gone on shore to them,
but Xury—who knew best—said, "Not you go!
Not you go!" So I brought the boat as near
the land as I could, that I might talk to them, and
they kept up with me a long way. I saw that one
of them had a lance in his hand.
I made signs that they should bring me some
food, and they on their part made signs for me to
stop my boat. So I let down the top of my sail,
and lay by, while two of them ran off; and in less
than half an hour they came back with some dry
meat and a sort of corn which is grown in this
i
part of the world. This we should have been
glad to get, but knew not how to do so; for we
durst not go on shore to them, nor did they dare
to come to us.
At last they took a safe way for us all, for they
brought the food to the shore, where they set it
down, and then went a long way off while we took
it in. We made signs to show our thanks, for we
had not a thing that we could spare to give them.
But as good luck would have it, we were at
hand to take a great prize for them; for two
wild beasts, of the same kind as I first spoke of,
came running down the hills to the sea.
They swam as if they had come for sport. The
men flew from them in fear, all but the one who
held the lance. One of these beasts came near
our boat; so I lay in wait for him with my gun;
and as soon as the brute was in range, I shot him
through the head. Twice he sank down in the
sea, and twice he came up; and then just swam
to the land, where he fell down dead. The men
were in as much fear at the sound of my gun as
they had been at the sight of the beasts. But
when I made signs for them to come to the shore,
they took heart, and came.
They at once made for their prize; and by the
help of a rope, which they slung round him, they
brought him safe on the beach.
We now left our wild men, and went on and
on, for twelve days more. The land in front of
us ran out four or five miles, like a bill; and we
had to keep some way from the coast to make
this point, so that we lost sight of the shore.
I gave the helm to Xury, and sat down to
think what would be my best course to take;
when all at once I heard the lad cry out, "A ship
with a sail! A ship with a sail!" He did not
show much joy at the sight, for he thought that
this ship had been sent out to take him back; but
I knew well, from the look of her, that she was
not one of the Turk's.
I made all the sail I could to come in the ship's
way, and told Xury to fire a gun, in the hope that
if those on deck could not hear the sound, they
might see the smoke. This they did see, and
then let down their sails, so that we might come
up to them, and in three hours' time we were at
the ship's side. The men spoke to us in French,
but I could not make out what they meant. At
last a Scot on board said in my own tongue,'' Who
are you? Whence do you come!" I told him in
a few words how I had got free from the Moors.
Then the man who had charge of the ship bade
me come on board, and took me in, with Xury
and all my goods. I told him that he might take
all I had; but he said, "You shall have your
goods back when we come to land, for I have but
done for you what you would have done for me,
had I been in the same plight."
He gave me a good round sum for my boat
and said that I should have the same sum for
Xury, if I would part with him. But I told him
that as it was by the boy's help that I had got
free, I was loth to sell him. He said it was just
and right in me to feel thus, but at the same time,
if I could make up my mind to part with him, he
should be set free in two years' time. So, as the
poor slave had a wish to go with him, I did not
say no. I got to All Saints' Bay in three weeks.
I had made a good sum by all my store, and
with this I went on land. But I did not at all know
what to do next. At length I met with a man
whose case was much the same as my own, and
we both took some land to farm. My stock, like
his, was low, but we made our farms serve to
keep us in food, though not more than that. We
both stood in need of help, and I saw now that I
had done wrong to part with my boy.
I did not at all like this kind of life. What!
thought I, have I come all this way to do that
which I could have done as well at home with my
friends round me? And to add to my grief, the
kind friend who had brought me here in his ship,
now meant to leave these shores.
On my first start to sea when a boy, I had put
a small sum in the hands of an aunt, and this my
friend said I should do well to spend on my farm.
So when he got home he sent some of it in cash,
and laid out the rest in cloth, stuffs, baize, and
such like goods. My aunt had put a few pounds
in my friend's hands as a gift to him, to show her
thanks for all that he had done for me, and with
this sum he was so kind as to buy me a slave. In
the mean time I had bought a slave, so now I had
two, and all went on well for the next year.
But soon my plans grew too large for my means.
One day some men came to ask me to take
charge of a slave ship to be sent out by them.
They said they would give me a share in the
slaves, and pay the cost of the stock. This would
have been a good thing for me if I had not had
farms and land; but it was wild and rash to think
of it now, for I had made a large sum, and ought
to have gone on in the same way for three or
four years more. Well, I told these men that
I would go with all my heart, if they would look
to my farm in the mean time, which they said they
would do.
So I made my will, and went on board this
ship on the same day on which, eight years
since, I had left Hull. She had six guns,
twelve men, and a boy.' We took with us saws,
I BOUGHT ME A BLACK SLAVE
25
chains, toys, beads, bits of glass, and such like
ware, to suit the taste of those with whom we
had to trade.
We were not more than twelve days from the
Line, when a high wind took us off we knew not
where. All at once there was a cry of "Land!"
and the ship struck on a bank of sand, in which
she sank so deep that we could not get her off.
At last we found that we must make up our minds
to leave her, and get to shore as well as we could.
There had been a boat at her stern, but we found
it had been torn off by the force of the waves.
One small boat was still left on the ship's side, so
we got in it.
There we were all of us on the wild sea. The
heart of each now grew faint, our cheeks were
pale, and our eyes were dim, for there was but
one hope, and that was to find some bay, and so
get in the lee of the land. We now gave up our
whole souls to God.
The sea grew more and more rough, and its
white foam would curl and boil. At last the
waves, in their wild sport, burst on the boat's
side, and we were all thrown out.
I could swim well, but the force of the waves
made me lose my breath too much to do so. At
length one kiree wave took me to the shore, and
left me high and dry, though half dead with fear.
27
I got on my feet and made the best of my way
for the land; but just then the curve of a huge
wave rose up as high as a hill, and this I had no
strength to keep from, so it took me back to the
vrTtfprpt.^^fL*^?''*''^

WE WENT TO OUR RUIN WITH OUR OWN HANDS
sea. I did my best to float on the top, and held
my breath to do so. The next wave was quite as
high, and shut me up in its bulk. I held my hands
down tight to my side, and then my head shot out at the top of the waves. This gave me heart
and breath too, and soon my feet felt the ground.
I stood quite still for a short time, to let the sea
run back from me, and then I set off with all my
might to the shore, but yet the waves caught me,
and twice more did they take me back, and twice
more land me on the shore. I thought the last
wave would have been the death of me, for it
drove me on a piece of rock, and with such force
as to leave me in a kind of swoon, which, thank
God, did not last long. At length, to my great
joy, I got up to the cliffs close to the shore, where
I found some grass, out of the reach of the sea.
There I sat down, safe on land at last.
I could but cry out in the words of the Psalm,
"They that go down to the sea in ships, these
men see the works of the Lord in the deep. For
at His word the storms rise, the winds blow, and
lift up the waves; then do they mount to the sky,
and from thence go down to the deep. My soul
faints, I reel to and fro, and am at my wit's end;
then the Lord brings me out of all my fears."
I felt so wrapt in joy, that all I could do was to
walk up and down the coast, now lift up my
hands, now fold them on my breast and thank God
for all that He had done for me, when the rest of
the men were lost. All lost but I, and I was safe!
I now cast my eyes round me, to find out what
29
kind of a place it was that I had been thus thrown
in, like a bird in a storm. Then all the glee I felt
at first left me; for I was wet and cold, and had
no dry clothes to put on, no food to eat, and not
a friend to help me.

SAFE ON LAND AT LAST
There were wild beasts here, but I had no gun
to shoot them with, or to keep me from their
jaws. I had but a knife and a pipe.
It now grew dark; and where was I to go for
the night! I thought the top of some high tree
would be a good place to keep me out of harm's
way; and that there I might sit and think of death,
for, as yet, I had no hopes of life. Well, I went
to my tree, and made a kind of nest to sleep
in. Then I cut a stick to keep off the beasts of
prey, in case they should come, and fell to sleep
just as if the branch I lay on had been a bed of
down.
When I woke up it was broad day; the sky too
was clear and the sea calm. But I saw from the
top of the tree that in the night the ship had left
the bank of sand, and lay but a mile from me;
while the boat was on the beach, two miles on my
right. I went some way down by the shore, to
get to the, boat; but an arm of the sea, half a
mile broad, kept me from it. At noon, the tide
went a long way out, so that I could get near the
ship; and here I found that if we had but made
up our minds to stay on board, we should all have
been safe.
I shed tears at the thought, for I could not help
it; yet, as there was no use in that, it struck me
that the best thing for me to do was to swim to
the ship. I soon threw off my clothes, took to the
sea, and swam up to the wreck. But how was I to
get on deck? I had swum twice round the ship,
31
when a piece of rope caught my eye, which hung
down from her side so low, that at first the

waves hid it. By the help of this rope» I got on
board.
I found that there was a bulge in the ship, and
that she had sprung a leak. You may be sure that
my first thought was to look around for some food,
and I soon made my way to the bin where the
bread was kept, and ate some of it as I went to
and fro, for there was no time to lose. There
was, too, some rum, of which I took a good
draught, and this gave me heart. What I stood
most in need of was a boat to take the goods to
shore. But it was vain to wish for that which
could not be had; and as there were some spare
yards in the ship, two or three large planks of
wood, and a spare mast or two, I fell to work with
these to make a raft.
I put four spars side by side, and laid short bits
of plank on them, cross-ways, to make my raft
strong. Though these planks would bear my
own weight, they were too slight to bear much
of my freight. So I took a saw which was
on board, and cut a mast in three lengths,
and these gave great strength to the raft. I
found some bread and rice, a Dutch cheese, and
some dry goat's flesh. There had been some
wheat, but the rats had got at it, and it was all
gone.
My next task was to screen my goods from the
spray of the sea; and it did not take me long to
do this, for there were three large chests on board
which held all, and these I put on the raft. When
the high tide came up it took off my coat and
Robinson Crusoe
"'I WORE A HIGH CAP OF GOAT SKIN.'
3—Robinson Cru.
shirt, which I had left on the shore; but there
were some fresh clothes in the ship.
"See, here is a prize J" said I, out loud (though
there were none to hear me); "now I shall not
starve." For I found four large guns. But how
was my raft to be got to land! I had no sail, no
oars; and a gust of wind would make all my
store slide off. Yet there were three things which
I was.glad of—a calm sea, a tide which set in to
the shore, and a slight breeze to blow me there.
I had the good luck to find some oars in a part
of the ship in which I had made no search till now.
With these I put to sea, and for half a mile my
raft went well; but soon I found it drove to
one side. At length I saw a creek, up which,
with some toil, I took my raft; and now the
beach was so near, that I felt my oar touch the
ground.
Here I had well nigh lost my freight, for the
shore lay on a slope, so that there was no place
to land on, save where one end of the raft would
lie so high, and one end so low, that all my goods would fall off. To wait till the tide came up was
all that could be done. So, when the sea was a
foot deep, I thrust the raft on a flat piece of
ground, to moor her there, and stuck my two oars
in the sand, one on each side of the raft. Thus
I let her lie, till the ebb of the tide, and when it
went down, she was left safe on land with all her
freight.
I saw that there were birds on the isle, and I
shot one of them. Mine must have been the first
gun that had been heard there since the world
was made; for, at the sound of it, whole flocks of
birds flew up, with loud cries, from all parts of the
Wood. The shape of the beak of the one I shot
was like that of a hawk, but the claws were not
so large.
I now went back to my raft to land my stores,
and this took up the rest of the day. What to do
at night I knew not, nor where to find a safe
place to land my stores on. I did not like to lie
down on the ground, for fear of beasts of prey,
as well as snakes, but there was no cause for these
fears, as I have since found. I put the chests and
boards round me as well as I could, and made a
kind of hut for the night.
As there was still a great store of things left in
the ship, which would be of use to me, I thought
that I ought to bring them to land at once; for I
knew that the first storm would break up the
ship. So I went on board, and took good care
this time not to load my raft too much.
The first thing I sought for was the tool chest;
and in it were some bags of nails, spikes, saws,
knives, and such things; but best of all, I found
a stone to grind my tools on. There were two
or three flasks, some large bags of shot, and a
roll of lead; but this last I had not the strength
to hoist up to the ship's side, so as to get it on
my raft. There were some spare sails too, which
I brought to shore.
I had some fear lest my stores might be run
off with by beasts of prey, if not by men; but I
found all safe and sound when I went back, and
no one had come there but a wild-cat, which sat
on one of the chests. When I came up I held
my gun at her, but as she did not know what a
gun was, this did not rouse her. She ate a piece
of dry goat's flesh, and then took her leave.
Now that I had two freights of goods on hand,
I made a tent with the ship's sails, to stow them
in, and cut the poles for it from the wood. I now
took all the things out of the casks and chests,
and put the casks in piles round the tent, to give
it strength; and when this was done, I shut up
the door with the boards, spread one of the beds
(which I had brought from the ship) on the
ground, laid two guns close to my head, and went
to bed for the first time. I slept all night, for I
was much in need of rest.
The next day I was sad and siek at heart, for I
felt how dull it was to be thus cut off from all the
rest of the world! I had no great wish for work:
but there was too much to be done for me to
dwell long on my sad lot. Each day, as it came,
I went off to the wreck to fetch more things; and
I brought back as much as the raft would hold.
One day I had put too great a load on the raft,
which made it sink down at one side, so that the
goods were lost in the sea; but at this I did not
fret, as the chief part of the freight was some rope,
which would not have been of much use to me.
The twelve days that I had been in the isle were
spent in this way, and I had brought to land all
that one pair of hands could lift; though if the sea
had been still calm, I might have brought the
whole ship, piece by piece.
The last time I swam to the wreck, the wind
blew so hard, that I made up my mind to go on
board next time at low tide. I found some tea
and some gold coin; but as to the gold, it made,
me laugh to look at it. "O drug!" said I, "thou
art of no use to me! I care not to save thee.
Stay where thou art till the ship goes down; then
go thou with it!"
Still, I thought I might as well just take it; so
I put it in a piece of the sail, and threw it on deck
that I might place it on the raft. By-and-by, the
wind blew from the shore, so I had to swim back
with all speed; for I knew that at the turn of the
tide I should find it hard work to get to land at all.
But in spite of the high wind, I came to my home
all safe. At dawn of day I put my head out, and
cast my eyes on the sea, when.lo! no ship was
there! This change in the face of things, and the
loss of such a friend, quite struck me down. Yet I
was glad to think that I had brought to shore all
that could be of use to me. I had now to look
out for some spot where I could make my home.
Half way up the hill there was a small plain, four
or five score feet long, and twice as broad; and
as it had a full view of the sea, I thought that it
would be a good place for my house.
I first dug a trench round a space which took in
twelve yards; and in this I drove two rows of
stakes, till they stood firm like piles, five and a
half feet from the ground. I made the stakes
close and tight with bits of rope, and put small
sticks on the top of them in the shape of spikes.
This made so strong a fence that no man or beast
could get in.
The door of my house was on top, and I had to
climb up to it by steps, which I took in with me,
so that no one else might come up by the same
way. Close to the back of the house stood a high
rock, in which I made a cave, and laid all the earth
that I had dug out of it round my house, to the
height of a foot and a half. I had to go out once
a day in search of food. The first time, I saw some
THE KID KAN BY MY SIDE
39
goats, but they were too shy and swift of foot to
let me get near them.
At last I lay in wait for them close to their own
haunts. If they saw me in the vale, though they
might be on high ground, they would run off, wild
with fear; but if they were in the vale, and I on
high ground, they took no heed of me. The first
goat I shot had a kid by her side, and when the
old one fell, the' kid stood near her, till I took her
off on my back, and then the young one ran by
my side. I put down the goat, and brought the
kid home to tame it; but as it was too young to
feed I had to kill it.
At first I thought that, for the lack of pen and
ink, I should lose all note of time; so I made a
large post, in the shape of a cross, on which I
cut these words: "I came on these shores on the
8th day of June, in the year 1659." On the side
of this post I made a notch each day as it came,
and this.I kept up till the last.
I have not yet said a word of my four pets,
which were two cats, a dog, and a bird. You
may guess how fond I was of them, for they were
all the friends left to me. I brought the dog and
two cats from the ship. The dog would fetch
things for me at all times, and by his bark, his
whine, and his tricks, he would all but talk; yet he
could not give me thought for thought.
THE DOG WOULD FETCH THINGS 1'OR ME
41
If I could but have had some one near me to
find fault with, or to find fault with me, what a
treat it would have been! Now that I had
brought ink from the ship, I wrote down a sketch
of each day as it came; not so much to leave to
those who might read it, when I was dead and
gone, as to get rid of my own thoughts, and draw
me from the fears which all day long dwelt on my
mind, till my head would ache with the weight of
them.
I was a long way out of the course of ships;
and oh! how dull it was to be cast on this lone
spot with no one to love, no one to make me
laugh, no one to make me weep, no one to make me
think. It was dull to roam, day by day, from the
Wood to the shore, and from the shore back to the
wood, and feed on my own thoughts all the while.
So much for the sad view of my case; but like
most things, it had a bright side as well as a dark
one. For here was I safe on land, while all the
rest of the ship's crew were lost. Well, thought
I, God, who shapes our ways,' and led me by the
hand then, can save me from this state now, or
send some one to be with me. True, I am cast on
a rough and rude part of the globe, but there are
no beasts di prey on it to kill or hurt me. God
has sent the ship so near to me, that I have got
from it all things to meet my wants for the rest
N*u

BLADES OFRICE,CORN, AND RY1S SPRANG UP
43
of my days. Let life be what it may, there is
sure to be much to thank God for. And I soon
gave up all dull thoughts, and did not so much
as look out for a sail.
My goods from the wreck had been in the cave
for more than ten months; and it was time now
to put them right, as they took up all the space,
and left me no room to turn in: so I made my
small cave a large one, and dug it out a long way
back in the sand rock. Then I brought the mouth
of it up to the fence, and so made a back way to
my house. This done I put shelves on each side,
to hold my goods, which made my cave look like
a shop full of stores. To make these shelves I cut down a tree, and with the help of a saw, an
axe, a plane, and some more tools, I made boards.
A chair, and a desk to write on, came next. I
rose in good time, and set to work till noon, then
I ate my meal, then I went out with my gun, and
to work once more till the sun had set; and then
to bed. It took me more than a week to change
the shape and size of my cave, but I had made it
far too large, for in course of time the earth fell
in from the roof; and had I been in it when this
took place, I should have lost my life. I had now
to set up posts in my cave, with planks on the
top of them, so as to make a roof of wood.
One day, when out with my gun, I shot a wild-
.'w
] SCW MY (JRAIN
45
cat, the skin of which made me a cap; and I found
some birds of the dove tribe, which built their
nests in the holes of rocks.
I had to go to bed at dusk, till I made a lamp
of goat's fat, which I put in a clay dish; and this,
with a piece of hemp for a wick, made a good
light. As I had found a use for the bag which
had held the fowl's food on board ship, I shook
out from it the husks of corn. This was just at
the time when the great rains fell, and in the
course of a month, blades of rice, corn and rye
sprang up. As time went by, and the grain was
ripe, I kept it, and took care to sow it each year;
but I could not boast of a crop of wheat, as will
be shown by-and-by, for three years.
A thing now took place on the isle, which no
one could have dreamt of, and which struck me
down with fear. It was this—the ground shook
with great force, which threw down earth from the
rock with a loud crash—once more there was a
shock—and now the earth fell from the roof of
my cave. The sea did not look the same as it
had done, for the shocks were just as strong there
as on land. The sway of the earth made me feel
sick; and there was a noise and a roar all round
me.
The same kind of a shock came a third time;
and when it had gone off, I sat quite still on the
CRUSOE GRINDS II!S TOOLS
47
ground, for I knew not what to do. Then the
clouds grew dark, the wind rose, trees were torn
up by the roots, the sea was a mass of foam and
froth, and a great part of the isle was laid waste
with the storm. I thought that the world had come
to an end. In three hours' time all was calm; but
rain fell all that night and a great part of the next
day. Now, though quite worn out, I had to move
my goods, which were in the cave, to some safe
place.
I knew that tools would be my first want, and
that I should have to grind mine on the stone, as
they were blunt and worn with use. But as it
took both hands to hold the tool, I could not turn
the stone; so I made a wheel by which I could
move it with my foot. This was no small task,
but I took great pains with it, and at length it was
done.
The rain fell for some days and a cold chill
came on me; in short, I was ill. I had pains in
my head, and could get no sleep at night, and my
thoughts were wild and strange. At one time I
shook with cold, and then a hot fit came on, with
faint sweats, which would last six hours at a time.
Ill as I was, I had to go out with my gun to get
food. I shot a goat, but it was a great toil to
bring it home, and still more to cook it.
I spent the next day in bed, and felt half dead
from thirst, yet too weak to stand up to get some
drink. I lay and wept like a child. "Lord, look
on me! Lord, look on me!" would I cry for
hours.
At last the fit left me, and I slept, and did not
wake till dawn. I dreamt that I lay on the ground,
and saw a man come down from a great black
cloud in a flame of light. When he stood on the
earth, it shook -as it had done a few days since;
and all the world to me was full of fire. He came
up and said: "As I see that all these things have
not brought thee to pray, now thou shalt die."
Then I woke and found it was a dream. Weak
and faint, I was in dread all day lest my fit should
come on.
Too ill to get out with my gun, I sat on the
shore to think, and thus ran my thoughts: "What
is this sea which is all round me! -and whence is
it? There can be no doubt that the hand that
made it made the air, the earth, the sky. And
who is that? It is God, who hath made all things.
Well, then, if God hath made all things, it must
be He who guides them; and if so, no one thing
in the whole range of His 'works can take place
and He not know it. Then God must know how
sick and sad I am, and He wills me to be here.
Oh, why hath God done this to me?"
Then some voice would seem to say: "Dost
4—Robinson Crusoe.
thou ask why God hath done this to thee? Ask
why thou wert not shot by the Moors, who came
on board the ship, and took the lives of thy mates.
Ask why thou wert not torn by the beasts of prey
on the coasts. Ask why thou didst not go down
in the deep sea with the rest of the crew, but didst
come to this isle and art safe."
A sound sleep then fell on me, and when I woke
it must have been three o'clock the next day, by
the rays of the sun; nay, it may have been more
than that; for I think that this must have been
the day that I did not mark on my post, as I
have since found that there was one notch too
few.
I now took from my store the Book of God's
Word, which I had brought from the wreck, not
one page of which I had as yet read. My eyes
fell on five words, that would seem to have been
put there for my good at this time; so well did
they cheer my faint hopes, and touch the true
source of my fears. They were these: "I will
not leave thee." And they have dwelt in my
heart to this day. I laid down the book, to pray.
My cry was, "O Lord, help me to love and learn
Thy ways." This was the first time in all my life
that I had felt a sense that God was near, and
heard me. As for my dull life here, it was not
worth a thought; for now a new strength had
--^^....:i._.,:,~,.',..-i.-..^:^,t^TT."* .'.'. r:-t
IN SKAKCU OF b, Si'KINGS AND CHEEKS 51
come to me; and there was a change in my griefs,
as well as in my joys.
I had now been in the isle twelve months, and •
I thought it was time to go all round it, in search
of its woods, springs, and creeks. So I set off,.
red brought back with me limes and grapes in
their prime, large and ripe. I had hung the
grapes in the sun to dry, and in a few days' time
went to fetch them,'that I might lay up a store.
The vale, on the banks of which they grew, was
fresh and green, and a clear bright stream ran
through it, which gave so great a charm to the
spot, as to make me wish to live there.
But there was no view of the sea from this vale,
while from my house, no ships could come on my
side of the isle, and not be seen by me; yet the
cool, soft banks were so sweet and new to me,
that much of my time was spent there.
In the first of the three years in which I had
grown corn, I had sown it too late; in the next it
was spoilt by the drought; but the third year's
crop had sprung up well.
I found that the hares would lie in it night and
day, for which there was no cure but to plant a
thick hedge all round it; and this took me more
than three weeks to do. I shot the hares in the
day time; and at dark I made fast the dog's chain
to the gate, and there he stood to bark all night.
.w--
;'.'.
It

I EXPLORED THE ISLAND
53
In a short time the corn grew strong, and at
last ripe; but, just as the hares had hurt it in the
blade, so now the birds ate it in the ear. At the
noise of my gun, whole flocks of them would fly
up; and at this rate I saw that there would be no
corn left; so I made up my mind to keep a look
out night and day. I hid by the side of a hedge,
and could see the birds sit on the trees and watch
and then come down, one by one, as at first.
Now each grain of wheat was, as it were, a
small loaf of bread to me. So the great thing was
to get rid of these birds. My plan was this: I
shot three, and hung them up like thieves, to scare
all that came to the corn; and from this time, as
long as the dead ones hung here, not a bird came
near. When the corn was ripe, I made a scythe
out of the swords from the ship, and got in my
crop.
Few of us think of the cost at which a loaf of
bread is made. Of course, there was no plow here
to turn up the earth, and no spade to dig it with, so
I made one with wood; but this was soon worn
out, and for want of a rake, I made use of the
bough of a tree. When I had got the corn home,
I had to thresh it, part the grain from the chaff,
and store it up. Then came the want of a mill to
grind it, of sieves to clean it, and of yeast to make
bread of it.
I DROVE AWAY THE HIRDS
55
Still, my bread was made, though I had no
tools; and no one could say that I did not earn it
by the sweat of my brow. When the rain kept
me in doors, it was good fun to teach my pet bird
Poll to talk; but so mute were all things round
me, that the sound of my own voice made me
start.
My chief wants now were jars, pots, cups, and
plates, but I knew not how I could make them. At
last I went in search of some clay, and found some
a mile from my house; but it was quite a joke to
see the queer shapes and forms that I made out
of it. For some of my pots and jars were too
weak to bear their own weight; and they would
fall out here, and in there, in all sorts of ways;
while some, when they were put in the sun to
bake, would crack with the heat of its rays. You
may guess what my joy was when at last a pot
was made which would stand the heat of the fire,
so that I could boil the meat for broth.
The next thing to be made was a sieve, to part
the grain from the husks. Goat's hair was of no
use to me, as I could not weave or spin; so I
made a shift for two years, with a thin kind of
stuff, which I brought from the ship. But to grind
the corn with the stones was the worst of all, such
hard work did I find it. To bake the bread I burnt
some wood down to an ash, which I threw on the
57
hearth to heat it, and then set my loaves on the
hearth, and in this way my bread was made.
The next thing to turn my thoughts to was the
ship's boat, which lay on the high ridge of sand,

WHAT ODD QUEER THINGS I MADE
where it had been thrust by the storm which had
cast me on the shores. But it lay with the keel
to the sky, so I had to dig the sand from it, and
turn it up with the help of a pole. When I had
done this, I found it was all in vain, for I had not
the strength to launch it. So all I could do now
was to make a boat of less size out of a tree; and
I found one. that was just fit for it, which grew not
far from the shore, but I could no more stir this
than I could the ship's boat.
What was to be done? I first dug the ground
flat and smooth all the way from the boat to the
sea, so as to let it slide down; but this plan did
not turn out well, so I thought I would try a new
way, which was to make a trench, so as to bring
the sea up to the boat, as the boat could not be
brought to the sea. But to do this, I must have
dug down to a great depth, which would take one
man some years to do. And when too late, I
found it was not wise to work out a scheme till I
first thought of the cost and toil.
"Well," thought I, "I must give up the boat,
and with it all my hopes to leave the isle. But I
have this to think of: I am lord of the whole isle;
in fact, a king. I have wood with which I might
build a fleet, and grapes, if not corn, to freight
it with, though all my wealth is but a few
gold coins." For these I had no sort of use,
and could have found it in my heart to give them
all for a peck of peas and some ink, which
last I stood much in need of. But it' was best
to dwell more on what I had than on what I had
not.
.;^r.

I BROUGHT MY BOAT UP THE CREEK
59
I now must needs try once more to build a boat,
but this time it was to have a mast, for which the
ship's sails would be of great use. I made a
deck at each end to keep out the spray of the sea,
a bin for my food, and a rest for my gun, with
a flap to screen it from the wet. More than
all, the boat was one of such a size that I could
launch it.
My first cruise was up and down the creek, but
soon I got bold, and made the whole round of my
isle. I took with me bread, cakes, and a pot full
of rice, some rum, half a goat, two great coats,
one of which was to lie on, and one to put on at
night. I set sail in the sixth year of my reign.
On the east side of the isle there was a large ridge
of rocks which lay two miles from the shore, and
a shoal of sand lay for half a mile from the rocks
to the beach. To get round to this point I had to
sail a great way out to sea; and here I all but
lost my life.
But I got back to my home at last. On my
way- there, quite worn out with the toils of the
boat, I lay down in the shade to rest my limbs,
and slept. But judge, if you can, what a start I
gave when a voice woke me out of my sleep, and
spoke my name three times! A voice in this wild
place! To call me by name, too! Then the voice
said, "Where are you? Where have you been?
61
How came you here?" But now I saw it all; for
at the top of the hedge sat Poll, who did but say the

I BROIL MY MEAT ON THE COALS
words she had been taught by me. I now went in
search of some goats, and laid snares for them,
with rice for a bait. I had set the traps in
the night, and found they had all stood, though
the bait was all gone. So I thought of a new
way to take them, which was to make a pit and
lay sticks and grass on it, so as to hide it; and
in this way I caught an old goat and some kids.
But the old goat was much too fierce for me, so
I let him go.
I brought all the young ones home, and let
them fast a long time, till at last they fed from my
hand, and were quite tame. I kept them in a
kind of park, in which there were trees to screen
them from the sun. At first my park was three
miles round; -but it struck me that, in so great a
space, the kids would soon get as wild as if they
had the range of the whole vale, and that it would
be as well to give them less room; so I had to
make a hedge, which took me three months to
plant. My park held a flock of twelve goats,
and in two years more there were more than two
score.
My dog sat at meals with me, and one cat on
each side of me, on stools, and we had Poll to talk
to us. Now for a word or two as to the dress in
which I made a tour round the isle. I could but
think how droll it would look in the streets of the
town in which I was born. I wore a high cap of
goat's skin, with a flap that hung down, to keep
63
the sun and rain from my neck, a coat made from
the skin of a goat too, the skirts of which came

I MADE SOME CLOTHES
down to my hips, and the same on my legs, with
no shoes, but flaps of the fur round my shins. I
had a broad belt of the same round my waist,
which drew on with two thongs; and from it, on
my right side, hung a saw and an axe; and on
my left side a pouch for the shot. My beard had
not been cut since I came here. But no more
need be said of my looks, for there were few to
see me.
A strange sight was now in store for me, which
was to change the whole course of my life in the
isle.
One day at noon, while on a stroll down to a
part of the shore that was new to me, what should
I see on the sand but the print of a man's foot! I
felt as if I was bound by a spell, and could not
stir from the spot.
By-and-by I stole a look round me, but no
one was in sight. What could this mean? I
went three or four times to look at it. There it
was—the print of a man's foot; toes, heel, and
all the parts of a foot. How could it have come
there?
My head swam with fear; and as I left the spot,
I made two or three steps, and then took a look
around me; then two steps more, and did the
same thing. I took fright at the stump of an old
tree, and ran to my house, as if for my life. How
could aught in the shape of a man come to that
shore, and I not to know it? Where was the ship
RobinsonCrusoe—j.
'"THEY HAD WITH THEM THREE SLAVES.'

that brought him? Then a vague dread took
hold of my mind, that some man, or set of men,
had found me out; and it might be that they
meant to kill me, or rob me of all I had.

MY WORK AT DUSK
How strange a thing is the life of man! One
day we love that which the next day we hate.
One day we seek what the next day we shun.
S—Robinson Crusoe.
One day we long for the thing which the next
day we fear; and so we go on. Now, from the
time that I was cast on this isle, my great source
of grief was that I should be thus cut off from the
rest of my race. Why, then, should the thought
that a man might be near give me all this pain?
Nay, why should the mere sight of the print of a
man's foot make me quake with fear? It seems
most strange, yet not more strange than true.
Once it struck me that it might be the print of
my own foot, when first the storm cast me on
these shores. Could I have come this way from
the boat? Should it in truth turn out to be the
print of my own foot, I should be like a boy
who tells of a ghost, and feels more fright at
his own tale than those do whom he meant to
scare.
Fear kept me in doors for three days, till the
want of food drove me out. At last I was so bold
as to go down to the coast to look once more
at the print of the foot, to see if it was the same
shape as my own. I found it was not so large by
a great deal; so it was clear there were men on
the isle. Just at this time my good watch dog
fell down dead at my feet. He was old and
worn out, and in him I lost my best guard and
friend.
One day as I went from the hill to the coast, a
67
scene lay in front of me which made me sick at
heart. The spot was spread with the bones of
men. There was a round place dug in the earth,

HOW LIKE A KINGI DINE
where a fire had been made, and here some men
had come to feast. Now that I had seen this
sight, I knew not how to act; I kept close to my
home, and would scarce stir from it save to milk
my flock of goats.
To feel safe was now more to me than to be
well fed; and I did not care to drive a nail, or
chop a stick of wood, lest the sound of it should
be heard, much less would I fire a gun. As to
my bread and meat, I had to bake it at night
when the smoke could not be seen. But I soon
found the way to burn wood with turf at the top
of it, which made it like chark or dry coal; and
this I could use by day, as it had no smoke.
I found in the wood where I went to get the
sticks for my fire, a cave so large that I could
stand in it; but I made more haste to get out
than in; for two large eyes, as bright as stars,
shone out from it with a fierce glare. I took a
torch, and went to see what they could be, and
found that there was no cause for fear; for the
eyes were those of an old gray goat, which had
gone there to die of old age. I gave him a push,
to try to get him out of the cave, but he could not
rise from the ground where he lay; so I left him *
there to die, as I could not save his life.
I found the width of the cave was twelve feet;
but part of it, near the end, was so low that I had
to creep on my hands and feet to go in. AVhat
the length of it was I could not tell, for my light

I PRAYED FOR SAFETY
(if)
went out, and I had to give up my search. The
next day I went to the cave with large lights made
of goat's fat; and when I got to the end, I found
that the roof rose to two score feet or more.
As my lights shone on the walls and roof of the
cave, a sight burst on my view, the charms of which no tongue could tell; for the walls shone
like stars. What was in the rock to cause this
it was hard to say; they might be gems, or bright
stones, or gold. But let them be what they may,
this cave was a mine of wealth to me; for at such
time as I felt dull or sad, the bright scene would
flash on my mind's eye and fill it with joy.
All these years had gone by, with no new sight
to rest my eyes on, till this scene burst on them.
I felt as if I should like to spend the rest of my
life here, and at its close lie down to die in this
cave, like the old goat.
As I went home I was struck by the sight of some
smoke, which came from a fire no more than two
miles off. From this time I lost all my peace of
mind. Day and night a dread would haunt me
that the men who had made this fire would find
me out. I went home and drew up my steps, but
first I made all things round me look wild and
rude. To load my gun was the next thing to do,
and I thought it would be best to stay at home
and hide.
I KEPT A LOOK-OUT FROM THE TOP OF THE HILL
71
But this was not to be borne long. I had no
spy to send out, and all I could do was to get to
the top of the hill and keep a good look-out. At
last, through my glass, I could see a group of
wild men join in a dance round their fire. As
soon as they had left I took two guns, and slung
a sword on my side; then with all speed I set off to
the top of the hill, once more to have a good view.
This time I made up my mind to go up to the
men, but not with a view to kill them, for I felt
that it would be wrong to do so. With such a
load of arms it took me two hours to reach the
spot where the fire was; and by the time I got
there the men had all gone; but I saw them in
four boats out at sea.
Down on the shore, there was a proof of what
the work of these men had been. The signs of
their feast made me sick at heart, and I shut my
eyes. I durst not fire my gun when I went out for
food on that side the isle, lest there should be some
of the men left, who might hear it, and so find me
out. This state of things went on for a year and
three months, and for all that time I saw no more
men.
On the twelfth of May, a great storm of wind blew all day and night. As it was dark, I sat in
my house; and in the midst of the gale, I heard
a gun fire! My guess was that it must have been
73
from some ship cast on shore by the storm. So
I set a light to some wood on top of the hill, that
those in the ship if ship it should be, might know

I FOUND A DEAD BOY
that some one was there to aid them. I then
heard two more guns fire. When it was light, I
went to the south side of the isle and there lay
the wreck of a ship, cast on the rocks in the night
by the storm. She was too far off for me to see
if there were men on board.
Words cannot tell how much I did long to bring
but one of the ship's crew to the shore! So strong
was my wish to save the life of those on board,
that I could have laid down my own life to do so.
There are some springs in the heart which when
hope stirs them, drive the soul on' with such a
force, that to lose all chance of the thing one hopes
for would seem to make one mad; and thus was
it with me.
Now, I thought, was time to use my boat; so I
set to work at once to fit it out. I took on board
some rum (of which I still had a good deal left),
some dry grapes, a bag of rice, some goat's milk,
and cheese, and then put out to sea. A dread
came on me at the thought of the risk I had run
on the same rocks; but my heart did not quite
fail me, though I knew that as my boat was small,
if a gale of wind should spring up all would be
lost. Then I found that I must go back to the
shore till the tide should turn, and the ebb
come on.
I made up my mind to go out the next day with
the high tide, so I slept that night in my boat.
At dawn I set out to sea, and in less than two
hours I came up to the wreck. What a scene
I EXAMINED THE CHEST
75
was there! The ship had struck on two rocks.
The stern was torn by the force of the waves, the
masts were swept off, ropes and chains lay strewn
on the deck, and all was wrapt in gloom. As I
came up to the wreck, a dog swam to me with a
yelp and a whine. I took him on board my boat,
and when I gave him some bread, he ate it like a
wolf, and as to drink, he would have burst if I
had let him take his fill of it.
I went to the cook's room, where I found two
men, but they were both dead. The tongue was
mute, the ear was deaf, the eye was shut, and the
lip was stiff; still the sad tale was told, for each
had his arm round his friend's neck, and so they
must have sat to wait for death. What a change
had come on the scene, once so wild with the lash
of the waves and the roar of the wind! All was
calm now—death had done its work, and all had
felt its stroke, save the dog, and he was the one
thing that still had life.
I thought the ship must have come from Spain,
and there was much gold on board. I took some
of the chests and put them in my boat, but did
not wait to see what they held, and with this spoil,
and three casks of rum, I came back.
I found all things at home just as I had left
them—my goats, my cats, and my bird. The
scene in the cook's room was in my mind day and
*.. f%'

THE SAVAGES DANCED AROUND THE FIRE
77
night, and to cheer me up I drank some of the
rum. I then set to work to bring my freight from
the shore, where I had left it. In the chests there
were two great bags of gold and some bars of the
same, and near these lay three small flasks and
three bags of shot, which were a great prize.
From this time all went well with me for two
years; but it was not to last. One day, as I stood
on the hill, I saw six boats on the shore. What
could this mean? Where were the men who had
brought them? And what had they come for?
I saw through my glass that there were a score
and a half at least on the east side of the isle.
They had meat on the fire, round which I could
see them dance. They then took a man from one
of the boats, who was bound hand and foot; but
when they came to loose his bonds, he set off as
fast as his feet would take him, and in a straight
line to my house.
To tell'the truth, when I saw all the rest of the
men run to catch him my hair stood on end with
fright. In the creek he swam like a fish, and the
plunge which he took brought him through it in
a few strokes. All the men now gave up the
chase but two, and they swam through the creek,
but by no means so fast as the slave had done.
Now, I thought, was the time for me to help the
poor man, and my heart told me it would be right
SAVE MY LIFE 1 SHOT HIM DEAD
to do so. I ran down my steps with my two guns,
and went with all speed up the hill, and then down
by a short cut to meet them.
I gave a sign to the poor slave to come to me,
and at the same time went up to meet the two
men who were in chase of him. I made a rush
at the first of these, to knock him down with the
stock of my gun, and he fell. I saw the one who
was left aim at me with his bow, so, to save my
life, I shot him dead.
The smoke and noise from my gun gave the
poor slave who had been bound such a shock that
he stood still on the spot, as if he had been in a
trance, I gave a loud shout for him to come to
me, and I took care to show him that I was a
friend, and made all the signs I could think of to
coax him up to me. At length he came, knelt
down to kiss the ground, and then took hold of
my foot and set it on his head. All this meant
that he was my slave; and I bade him rise.
But there was more work to be done yet, for
the man who had had the blow from my gun was
not dead. I made a sign for my slave (as I shall
now call him) to look at him. At this he spoke
to me, and though I could not make out what he
said, yet it gave me a shock of joy; for it was the
first sound of a man's voice that I had heard for
all the years I had been on the isle.
HE CUT OFF THE SAVAGE'S HEAD
&—Robinson Crusoe.
The man whom I had struck with the stock of
my gun sat up, and my slave, who was in great
fear of him, made signs for me to lend him my
sword, which hung in a belt at my side. With
this he ran up to the man, and with one stroke
cut off his head. When he had done this he
brought me back my sword with a laugh and put
it down in front of me. I did not like to see the
glee with which he did it, and I did not feel that
my own life was quite safe with such a man.
He, in his turn, could but lift up his large brown
hands with awe to think that I had put his foe to
death while I stood so far from him. But as to
the sword, he and the rest of his tribe made use
of swords of wood, and this was why he knew so
well how to wield mine. He made signs to me to
let him go and see the man who had been shot; and
he gave him a turn round, first on this side, then
on that, and when he saw the wound made in the
breast by the shot, he stood quite still once more,
as if he had lost his wits. I made signs for him
to come back, for my fears told me that the rest
of the men might come in search of their friends.
I did not like to take my slave to my house,
nor to my cave; so I threw down some straw
from the rice plant for him to sleep on, and gave
him some bread and a bunch of dry grapes to eat.
He was a fine man, with straight, strong limbs,
. ass iHk

I TAUGHT FRIDAY TO SPEAK ENGLISH
83
tall and young. His hair was thick, like wool, and
black. His head was large and high, and he had
bright black eyes. He was of a dark brown hue;
his face was round and his nose small, but not
flat; he had a good mouth with thin lips, with
which he could give a soft smile; and his teeth
were as white as snow.
I had been to milk my goats in the field close
by, and when he saw me he ran to me and lay
down on the ground to show me his thanks. He
then put his head on the ground and set my foot on
his head, as he had done at first. He took all the
means he could think of to let me know that he
would serve me all his life; and I gave a sign to
show that I thought well of him.
The next thing was to think of some name to
call him by. I chose that of the sixth day of the
week (Friday), as he came to me on that day. I
took care not to lose sight of him all that night,
and when the sun rose I made signs for him to
come to me that I might give him some clothes,
for he wore none. We then went up to the top
of the hill to look out for the men, but as we could
not see them or their boats, it was clear that they
had left the isle.
My slave has since told me that they had had
a great fight with the tribe that dwelt next to
them, and that all those men whom each side took
in war were their own by right. My slave's foes
had four who fell to their share, of whom he was
one.
I now set to work to make my man a cap of
hare's skin, and gave him a goat's skin to wear
round his waist. It was a great source of pride
to him to find that his clothes were as good as
my own.
At night, I kept my guns, sword, and bow close
to my side; but there was no need for this, as my
slave was, in sooth, most true to me. He did all
that he was set to do, with all his whole heart in the
work; and I knew that he would lay down his life
to save mine. What could a man do more than
that? And oh, the joy to have him here to cheer
me in this lone isle!
I did my best to teach him, so like a child as he
was, to do and feel all that was right. I found
him apt, and full of fun; and he took great pains
to learn all that I could tell him. Our lives ran
on in a calm, smooth way; and, but for the vile
feasts which were held on the shore, I felt no wish
to leave the isle.
As Friday had by.. no means lost his zest for
these meals, it struck me that the best way to cure
him was to let him taste the flesh of beasts; so I
took him with me one day to the wood for some
sport. I saw a she goat, in the shade, with her
two kids. I caught Friday by the arm, and made
signs to him not to stir, and then shot one of the
kids; but the noise of the gun gave the poor man
a great shock. He did not see the kid, nor did
he know that it was dead. He tore his dress off
his breast to feel if there was a wound there; then
he knelt down to me, and took hold of my knees
to pray of me not to kill him.
To show poor Friday that his life was quite safe,
I led him by the hand, and told him to fetch the
kid. By-and-by, I saw a hawk in a tree, so I bade
him look at the gun, the hawk, and the ground;
and then I shot the bird. But my poor slave gave
still more signs of fear this time than he did at
first, for he shook from head to foot. He must
have thought that some fiend of death dwelt in the
gun, and I think that he would have knelt down to
it, as well as to me; but he would not so much as
touch the gun for some time, though he would
speak to it when he thought I was not near.
Once he told me that what he said to it was to ask
it not to kill him.
I brought home the bird, and made broth of it.
Friday was much struck to see me eat salt with
it, and made a wry face; but I, in my turn, took
some that had no salt with it, and I made a wry
face at that. The next day I gave him a piece of
kid's flesh, which I had hung by a string in front
"-.-.:
CRUSOE AND FRIDAY
87
of the fire to roast. My plan was to put two
poles, one on each side of the fire, and a stick on
the top of them to hold the string. When my
slave came to taste the flesh, he took the best
means to let me know how good he thought it.
The next day I sent him to beat out and sift
some corn. I let him see me make the bread,
and he soon did all the work. I- felt quite a love
for his true, warm heart, and he soon learnt to
talk to me. One day I said, "Do the men of
your tribe win in fight?" He told me, with a
smile that they did. "Well, then," said I, "how
came they to let their foes take you?"
"They run one, two, three, and make go in the
boat that time."
"Well, and what do the men do with those
they take?"
"Eat them all up."
This was not good news for me, but I went on,
and said, "Where do they take them?"
"Go to next place where they think."
"Do they come here?"
"Yes, yes, they come here, come else place too."
"Have you been here with them twice?"
"Yes, come there."
He meant the northwest side of the isle, so to
this spot I took him the next day. He knew the
place, and told me he was there once, and with
him twelve men. To let me know this, he placed
twelve stones all of a row, and made me count
them.
"Are not the boats lost on your shore now and
then?" He said that there was no fear, and that
no boats were lost. He told me that up a great
way by the moon—that is, where the moon then
came up—there dwelt a tribe of white men like
me, with beards. I felt sure that they must have
come from Spain, to work the gold mines. I put
this to him: "Could I go from this isle and join
those men?"
"Yes, yes, you may go in two boats."
It was hard to see how one man could go in
two boats, but what he meant was, a boat twice as
large as my own.
One day I said to my slave, "Do you know
who made you?"
But he could not tell at all what these words
meant. So I said, "Do you know who made the
sea, the ground we tread on, the hills, and
woods?" He said it was Beek, whose home was
a great way off, and that he was so old that the
sea and the land were not so old as he.
"If this old man has made all things, why do
not all things bow down to him?"
My slave gave a grave look, and said, "All
things say '0' to him."
"Where do the men in your land go when
they die?"
"All go to Beek."
I then held my hand up to the sky to point to
it, and said, "God dwells there. He made the
world, and all things in it. The moon and the
stars are the work of His hand. God sends the
wind and the rain on the earth, and the streams
that flow: He hides the face of the sky with
clouds, makes the grass to grow for the beasts of
the field, and herbs for the use of man. God's love
knows no end. When we pray, He draws near
to us and hears us."
It was a real joy to my poor slave to hear me
talk of these things. He sat still for a long time,
then gave a sigh, and told me that he would say
"0" to Beek no more, for he was but a short way
off, and yet he could not hear till men went up
the hill to speak to him.
"Did you go up the hill to speak to him?"
said I.
"No, Okes go up to Beek, not young mans."
"What do Okes say to him?"
"They say 'O.'" Now that I brought my man Friday to know
that Beek was not the true God, such was the
sense he had of my worth that I had fears lest I
should stand in the place of Beek. I did my
91
best to call forth his faith in Christ, and make it
strong and clear, till at last—thanks be to the

<'-:.
FRIDAY SEES THE BOAT
it
Lord—I brought him to the love of Him, with the
whole grasp of his soul.
To please my poor slave, I gave him a sketch
of my whole life; I told him where I was born,
and where I spent my days when a child. He was
glad to hear tales of the land of my birth, and of
the trade which we kept up, in ships, with all parts
of the known world. I gave him a knife and a
belt, which made him dance with joy.
One day as we stood on the top of the hill
at the east side of the isle, I saw him fix his
eyes on the main land, and stand for a long
time to gaze at it; then jump and sing, and call
out to me.
"What do you see?" said I.
"O joy!" said he, with a fierce glee in his eyes,
"O glad! There see my land!"
"Why did he strain his eyes to stare at this land
as if he had a wish to be there? It put fears in my
mind which made me feel far less at my ease with
him. Thought I, if he should go back to his
home, he will think no more of what I have taught
him and done for him. He will be sure to tell
the rest of his tribe all my ways, and come back
with, it may be scores of them, and kill me, and
then dance round me, as they did round the men,
the last time they came on my isle.
But these were all false fears, though they
found a place in my mind a long while; and I was
not so kind to him now as I had been. From
this time I made it a rule, day by day, to find out
if there were grounds for my fears or not. I said,
"Do you wish to be once more in your own
land?"
"Yes! I be much O glad to be at my own
land."
"What would you do there? Would you turn
wild, and be as you were?"
"No, no, I would tell them to be good, tell
them eat bread, corn, milk, no eat man more!''
"Why, they would kill you!"
"No, no, they no kill; they love learn."
He then told me that some white men who had
come on their shores in a boat had taught them a
great deal.
"Then will you go back to your land with me?"
He said he could not swim so far, so I told him
he should help me to build a boat to go in. Then
he said, "If you go, I go."
"I go? why, they would eat me!"
"No, me make them much love you."
Then he told me as well as he could, how kind
they had been to some white men. I brought out
the large boat to hear what he thought of it, but
he said it was too small. We then went to look
at the old ship's boat, which, as it had been in the
sun for years, was not at all in a sound state.
The poor man made sure that it would do. But
how were we to know this? I told him we should
build a boat as large as that, and that he should
go home in it. He spoke not a word, but was
grave and sad.
"What ails you?" said I.
"Why you grieve mad with your man?"
'' What do you mean? I am not cross with you.''
"No cross? no cross with me? Why send your
man home to his own land, then?"
"Did you not tell me you would like to go
back?"
"Yes, yes, we both there; no wish self there,
if you not there!"
"And what should I do there?"
"You do great deal much good! you teach wild
men be good men; you tell them know God, pray
God, and lead new life."
We soon set to work to make a boat that would
take us both. The first thing was to look out for
some large trees that grew near the shore, so that
we could launch our boat when it was made. My
slave's plan was to burn the wood to make it the
right shape; but as mine was to hew it, I set him
to work with my tools, and in two months' time
we had made a good strong boat; but it took a
long while to get her down to the shore.
Friday had the whole charge of her; and, large
as she was, he made her move with ease, and said.
95
"he thought she go there well, though great blow
wind!" He did not know that I meant to make a
mast and sail. I cut down a young fir tree for the
.( *m&v

INCH BY INCH ON GREAT LOGS
mast, and then I set to work at the sail. It made
me laugh to see my man stand and stare, when he
came to watch me sail the boat. But he soon
gave a jump, a laugh, and a clap of the hands
when he saw the sail jib and fall, first on this side,
then on that.
The next thing to do was to stow our boat up
in the creek, where we dug a small dock; and
when the tide was low, we made a dam, to
keep out the sea. The time of year had now
come for us to set sail, so we got out all our stores,
to put them in the boat.
One day I sent Friday to the shore, to get a
sort of herb that grew there. I soon heard him
cry out to me, '' 0 grief! 0 bad! 0 bad! 0 out
thare boats, one, two three!" "Keep a stout
heart," said I, to cheer him. . The poor man shook
with fear; for he thought that the men who
brought him here had now come back to kill him.
"Can you fight?" said I.
"Me shoot; but me saw three boats; one, two,
three!"
"Have no fear; those that we do not kill will
be sure to take fright at the sound of our guns.
Now will you stand by me and do just as you are
bid?"
"Me die when you bid die."
I gave him a good draught of rum; and when
he had drunk this, he took up an axe and two
guns, each of which had a charge of swan shot.
I took two guns as well, and put large shot in
them, and then hung my great sword by my side.
From the top of the hill, I saw with the help of
my glass, that the boats had each brought eight
men and one slave. They had come on shore
near the creek, where a grove of young trees
grew close down to the sea. They had with them
three slaves, bound hand and foot, and you who
read this, may guess what they were brought
here for. I felt that I must try and save them
from so hard a fate, and that to do this, I should
have to put some of their foes to death. So we
set forth on our way. I gave Friday strict charge
to keep close to me, and not to fire till I told him
to do so.
We went full a mile out of our way, that we
might get round to the wood to hide there. But
we had not gone far, when my old qualms came
back to me, and I thought, "Is it for me to dip
my hands in man's blood? Why should I kill
those who have done me no harm, and mean not
to hurt me? Nay, who do not so much as know
that they are in the wrong, when they hold
these feasts. Are not their ways a sign that
God has left them (with the rest of their tribe)
to their own dull hearts? God did not call me
to be a judge for Him. He who said 'Thou shalt
not'kill,' said it for me, as well as the rest of the
world."
7—Robinson Crusoe,
A throng of thoughts like these would rush on
my mind, as if to warn me to pause, till I felt sure
that there was>more to call me to the work than
I then knew of. I took my stand in the wood, to
watch the men at their feast, and then crept on,
with Friday close at my heels. Thus we went till
we came to the skirts of the wood. Then I said
to Friday, "Go up to the top of that tree, and
bring me word if you can see the men."
He went, and, quick as thought, came back to
say that they were all round the fire, and that the
man who was bound on the sand would be the
next they would kill. But when he told me that
it was a white man, one of my own race, I felt the
blood boil in my veins. Two of the gang had
gone to loose the white man from his bonds; so
now was the time to fire.
At the sound of our guns, we saw all the men
jump up from the ground where they sat. It
must have been the first gun they had heard in
their lives. They knew not which way to look.
I now threw down my piece, and took up a small
gun; Friday did the same; and I gave him the
word to fire. The men ran right and left, with
yells and screams.
I now made a rush out of the wood, that they
might see me, with my man Friday at my heels,
of course. We gave a loud shout, and ran up to
.«*^v.*v.'»'r*> >y, -;.".':'''.

AVE FIRED AT THE SAVAGES
the white man as fast as we could. There he lay
on the hot sand. I cut the flag, or rush, by which
he was bound, but he was too weak to stand or
speak, so I gave him some rum. He let me know
by all the signs that he could think of, how much
he stood in my debt for all that I had done for
him.
I said, "We will talk of that by and by; but
now we must do what we can to save our lives."
Friday, who was free to go where he chose, flew
here and there, and put all the men to the rout.
They fled in full haste1 to their boats, and were
soon out at sea; and so we got rid of our foes at
last.
The man whom we had found on the sand told
us that his name was Carl, and that he came from
Spain. But there was one more man to claim
our care; for the black men had left a small boat
on the sands, and in this I saw a poor wretch who
lay half dead. He could not so much as look up,
so tight was he bound, neck and heels. When
I cut the bonds from him he gave a deep groan,
for he thought that all this was but to lead him
out to die.
Friday then came up, and I bade him speak to
the old man in his own tongue, and tell him that
he was free. This good news gave him strength,
and he sat up in the boat. But when Friday
THE WHITE MAX LAY OX THE SAND
came to hear him talk, and to look him in the
face, it brought the tears to my eyes to see him
kiss and hug the poor old man, and dance round
him with joy, then weep, wring his hands, and
beat his own face and head, and then laugh once'
more, sing and leap. For a long time he could
not speak to me, so as to let me know what all this
meant. But at length he told me that he was the
son of this poor old man, and that his name was Jaf.
It would be a hard task for me to tell of all the
quaint signs Friday made to show his joy. He
went in and out of the boat five or six times, sat
down by old Jaf, and held the poor old man's
head close to his breast to warm it; then he set
to work to rub his arms and feet, which were cold
and stiff from the bonds. I told Friday to give
him some rum and bread; but he said, "None!
Bad dog eat all up self.'' He then ran off straight
to the house, and took no heed of my calls, but
went as swift as a deer.
In an hour's time, he came back with a jug in
his hand. The good soul had gone all the way
to the house, that Jaf might have a fresh draught
from my well; and with it he brought two
cakes, one of which I bade him take to Carl,
who lay in the shade of a tree. His limbs were
stiff and cold, and he was too weak to say
a word.
I set my man to rub his feet with rum, and
while he did so, I saw Friday turn his head
round from time to time, to steal a look at the
old man. Then we brought Carl and Jaf home
from the boat on our backs, as they could not
walk. The door of my house was at the top, and
the poor sick men could not climb the steps by
which I got in, so we made for them a tent of old
sails.
I was now a king of these three men, as well
as lord of the isle; and I felt proud to say, '' They
all owe their lives to their king, and would lay
them down for him if he bade them do so." But
I did not think that my reign was so soon to
come to an end. The next thing for us to do
was to give Carl and Jaf some food, and to kill
and roast a kid, to which we all four sat down,
and I did my best to cheer them.
Carl in a few days grew quite strong, and I
set him to work to dig some land for seed; for
it was clear we should want more corn now that
we had two more mouths to fill. So we put in
the ground all the stock of grain I had, and thus
we all four had as much work as we could do for
some time. When the crop grew, and was ripe,
we found we had a good store of grain.
We made a plan that Carl and Jaf should go
back to the main land, to try if they could get
some of the white men, who had been cast on
shore there, to come and live with us; so they
got out the boat, and took with them two guns,
and food for eight days. They were to come
back in a week's time, and I bade them hang out
a sign when they came in sight, so that we might
know who they were.
One day, Friday ran up to me in great glee,
and said, "They are back! They are back!" A
mile from shore, there was a boat with a sail,
which stood in for the land; but I knew it could
not be the one which our two friends had gone
out in, for it was on the wrong side of the isle
for that. I saw, too, through my glass, a ship
out at sea. There were twelve men in the boat,
three of whom were bound in chains, and four
had fire-arms.
By and by I saw one of the men raise his
sword to those who were in chains, and I felt
sure that all was not right. Then I saw that
three men who had been bound were set free;
and when they had come on shore they lay on
the ground, in the shade of a tree. I was soon
at their side, for their looks, so sad and worn,
brought to my mind the first few hours I had
spent in this wild spot, where all to me was wrapt
in gloom.
I went up to these men and said:
FRIDAY WENT TO THE STRANGER
105
"Who are you, Sirs?"
They gave a start at my voice and at my
strange dress, and made a move as if they would
fly from me. I said, "Do not fear me, for it may
be that you have a friend at hand, though you do
not think it." "He must be sent from the sky
then," said one of them with a grave look; and
he took off his hat to me at the same time. "All
help is from thence, Sir," I said. "But what
can I do to aid you? You look as if you had
some load of grief on your breast. I saw one of
the men lift his sword as if to kill you."
The tears ran down the poor man's face, as he
said, "Is this a god, or is it but a man?" "Have
no doubt on that score, Sir," said I, "for a god
would not have come with a dress like this.
No, do not fear—nor raise your hopes too high;
for you see but a man, yet one who will do
all he can to help you. Your speech shows
me that you come from the same land as I do.
I will do all I can to serve you. Tell me your
case."
"Our case, Sir, is too long to tell you while
they who would kill us were so near. My name
is Paul. To be short, Sir, my crew have thrust
me out of my ship, which you see out there, and
have left me here to die. It was as much as I
could do to make them sheathe their swords,
<*.' Ji^w^aSHBw1 Jkbs??. ." i '«'; ilk
"who are you, sirs'?"
107
which you saw were drawn to slay me. They have
set me down in this isle with these two men, my
friend here, and the ship's mate."
"Where have they gone?" said I.
'' There, in the wood close by. I fear they may
have seen and heard us. If they have, they will
be sure to kill us all."
"Have they fire-arms?"
"They have four guns, one of which is in the
boat."
"Well, then, leave all to me!"
"There are two of the men," said he, "who are
worse than the rest. All but these I feel sure
would go back to work the ship."
I thought it was best to speak out to Paul at
once, and I said, "Now if I save your life, there
are two things which you must do.''
But he read my thoughts, and said, "If you
save my life, you shall do as you like with
me and my ship, and take her where you
please.''
I saw that the two men, in whose charge the
boat had been left, had come on shore; so the
first thing I did was to send Friday to fetch from
it the oars, the sail, and the gun. And now the
ship might be said to be in our hands. When the
time* came for the men to go back to the ship,
they were in a great rage; for, as the boat had
109
now no sail nor oars, they knew not how to get
out to their ship.
We heard them say that it was a strange sort

THEY BEGGED US TO SPARETHEIRLIVES
of isle, for that sprites had come to the boat, to
take off the sails and oars. We could see them
run to and fro, with great rage; then go and sit
in the boat to rest, and then come on shore once
more. When they drew near to us, Paul and
Friday would fain have had me fall on them at
once. But my wish was to spare them, and kill
as few as I could. I told two of my men to creep
on their hands and feet close to the ground,
so that they might not be seen, and when they
got up to the men, not to fire till I gave the
word.
They had not stood thus long when three of
the crew came up to us. Till now we had but
heard their voice, but when they came so near as
to be seen, Paul and Friday stood up and shot at
them. Two of the men fell dead, and they were
the worst of the crew, and the third ran off. At
the sound of the guns I came up, but it was so
dark that the men could not tell if there were
three of us or three score.
It fell out just as I could wish, for I heard the
men ask: "To whom must we yield, and where
are they?" Friday told them that Paul was there
with the king of the isle, who had brought with
him a crowd of men! At this one of the crew
said: "If Paul will spare our lives we will yield."
"Then," said Friday, "you shall know the king's
will." Then Paul said to them: "You know
my voice; if you lay down your arms the king will
spare your lives."
v*i5#vf -;
THE SHIP THAT WAS TO TAKE ME AWAY
111
They fell on their knees to beg the same of me.
I took good care that they did not see me, but I
gave them my word that they should all live, that
I should take four of them to work the ship, and
that the rest would be bound hand and foot for the
good faith of the four. This was to show them
what a stern king I was.
Of course I soon set them free, and I put them
in a way to take my place on the isle. I told them
of all my ways, taught them how to mind the goats,
how to work the farm and make the bread. I
gave them a house to live in, fire-arms, tools and
my two tame cats; in fact, all but Poll and my gold.
As I sat on the top of the hill Paul came up to
me. He held out his hand to point to the ship,
and with much warmth took me to his arms and
said: '' My dear friend, there is your ship! for she
is all yours, and so are we, and all that is in her.''
I cast my eyes to the ship, which rode half a
mile off the shore, at the mouth of the creek, and
near the place where I had brought my raft to the
land. Yes, there she stood, the ship that was to
set me free and to take me where I might choose
to go. She set her sails to the wind and her flags
threw out their gay stripes in the breeze. Such a
sight was too much for me, and I fell down faint
with joy. Paul then took out a flask, which he
had brought for me, and gave me a dram, which
113
I drank, but for a good while I could not speak to
him.

IT WAS NO USE TO TALK WITH ME
Friday and Paul then went on board the ship,
and Paul took charge of her once more. We did
8—Robinson Crusoe.
not start that night, but at noon the next day I left
the isle—that lone isle, where I had spent so great
a part of my life—not much less than thrice ten
long years.
When I came back to the dear land of my birth
all was strange and new to me. I went to my old
home at York, but none of my friends were there,
and to my great grief I saw, on the stone at their
grave, the sad tale of their death.
As they had thought, of course, that I was dead,
they had not left me their wealth and lands, so
that I stood much in want of means, for it was but
a small sum that I had brought with me from the
isle. But in this time of need I had the luck to
find my good friend who once took me up at sea.
He was now grown too old for work, and had put
his son in the ship in his place. He did not know
me at first, but I was soon brought to his mind
when I told him who I was. I found from him that
the land which I had bought on my way to the isle
was now worth much.
As it was a long way off I felt no wish to go
and live there, so I made up my mind to sell it,
and in the course of a few months I got for it a
sum so large as to make me a rich man all at
once.
Weeks, months and years went by. I had a
farm, a wife and two sons and was by no means
R5" )

TVE ROWED OUT TO THE SHIP
young, but still I could not get rid of a strong wish
which dwelt in my thoughts by day and my dreams
by night, and that was to set foot once more on
my old isle.
I had now no need to work for food, or for
means of life; all I had to do was to teach my
boys to be wise and good, to live at my ease and
see my wealth grow day by day. Yet the wish
to go back to my wild haunts clung round me like
a cloud, and I could in no way drive it from me,
so true is it that "what is bred in the bone will
not come out of the flesh."
At length I lost my wife, which was a great blow
to me, and my home was now so sad that I made
up my mind to launch out once more on the
broad sea and go with my man Friday to that
lone isle where dwelt all my hopes.
I took with me as large a store of tools, clothes
and such like goods as I had room for, and men
of skill in all kinds of trades to live in the isle.
When we set sail we had a fair wind for some
time, but one night the mate, who was at the
watch, told me he saw a flash of fire and heard a
gun go off. At this we all ran on deck, from
whence we saw a great light, and as there was no
land that way, we know that it must be some ship
on fire at sea, which could not be far off, for we
heard the sound of the gun.

WE SAW A GREAT LIGHT
117
The wind was still fair, so we made our way for
the point where we saw the light, and in half an
hour it was but too plain that a large ship was on
fire in the midst of the broad sea. I gave the word
to fire off five guns, and we then lay by to wait
till break of day. But in the dead of the night the
ship blew up in the air, the flames shot forth, and
what there was left of the ship sank. We hung
out lights and our guns kept up a fire all night
long to let the crew know that there was help at
hand.
At eight o'clock the next day we found, by the
aid of the glass, that two of the ship's boats were
out at sea, quite full of men. They had seen us,
and had done their best to make us see them, and
in half an hour we came up with them.
It would be a hard task for me to set forth in
words the scene which took place in my ship when
the poor French folk (for such they were) came
on board. As to grief and fear these are soon
told—sighs, tears and groans make up the sum of
them, but such a cause of joy as this was, in sooth,
too much for them to bear, weak and all but dead
as they were.
Some would send up shouts of joy that rent the
sky; some would cry and wring their hands as if
in the depths of grief; some would dance, laugh
and sing; not a few were dumb, sick, faint, in a
swoon or half mad, and two or three were seen
to give thanks to God.
In this strange group there was a young French
priest, who did his best to soothe those around
him, and I saw him go up to some of the crew
and say to them: "Why do you scream and tear
your hair and wring your hands, my men? Let
your joy be free and full; give it full range and
scope, but leave off this trick of the hands and lift
them up in praise; let your voice swell out, not
in screams, but in hymns of thanks to God, who
has brought you out of so great a strait, for this
will add peace to your joy."
The next day they were all in a right frame of
mind, so I gave them what stores I could spare
and put them on board a ship that we met with on
her way to France, all save five, who, with the
priest, had a wish to join me.
But we had not set sail long when we fell in
with a ship that had been blown out to sea by a
storm and had lost her masts; and, worse than all,
her crew had not had an ounce of meat or bread
for ten days. I gave them all some food, which
they ate like wolves in the snow, but I thought it
best to check them, as I had fears that so much all
at once would cause the death of some of them.
There were a youth and a young girl in the
ship who the mate said he thought must be dead,
but he had not had the heart to go near them, for
the food was all gone. I found that they were
faint for the want of it, and as it were in the jaws
of death, but in a short time they both got well,
and as they had no wish to go back to their ship,
I took them with me. So now I had eight more
on board my ship than I had when I first set out.
In three months from the time when I left home,
I came in sight of my isle, and I brought the
ship safe up by the side of the creek, which was
near my old house.
I went up to Friday, to ask if he knew
where he was. He took a look round him, and
soon with a clap of the hands, said, "O yes! O
there! 0 yes! O there!'' By and by he set up a
dance with such wild glee, that it was as much as I
could do to keep him on deck. '' Well, what think
you, Friday?" said I, "shall we find"those whom
we left still here?"
He stood quite mute for a while, but when I
spoke of old Jaf (whose son Friday was), the
tears ran down his face, and his heart was full of
grief.
"No, no," said he, "no more; no, no more."
"How do you know that?" said I; but he shook
his head and said, "O no, O no, he long dead, he
much old man.''
Just then his quick eye caught sight of some
THE SHIPWRECKED MEN CAME ON' BOARD
121
men at the top of the hill, and he said, "I see
men there, there, there!"
I could not see the least sign of them, but I
gave the word to fire three guns, to show that we
were friends, and soon we saw smoke rise from
the side of the creek. I then got out the boat,
put up a flag of peace, and went on shore with
Friday, the French priest, and some of the crew.
We all had arms with us, in case there should be
foes on the isle that we knew not of, but we found
that there was no need to be on our guard. The
first man I cast my eyes on at the creek was my
old friend Carl from Spain, whom I took from
the hands of the red men when I was last on
the isle.
I gave strict charge to all in the boat not to
go on shore, but Friday could not be kept back,
for he had caught sight of old Jaf. We stood by
to watch him fly to the old man like a shaft from
a bow, and catch him in his arms, and stroke him,
and set him down in the shade; he then stood a
short way off to look at him, with all his soul in
his eyes, as one might view some choice work of
art. He next led the old man by the hand up
and down the shore, and now and then came to
the boat to fetch him a cake, or a sip of rum;
then he would set him down once more on the
ground, dance round and round him, and all the
123
while tell him strange tales of what he had seen
since he and old Jaf had last met.
Carl and his friends bore a flag of truce like
sf?v; "v, -
(rWh^SBwi—

I CAME FAIR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF MY ISLE
mine, and at first Carl could not make out who I
was; but when I spoke to him in his own tongue,
he threw up his arms and said that he felt shame
not to have known the face of the man who had
once come to save him. He shook my hands
with much warmth, and then took me to my old
house, which he now gave up to me.
I could no more have found the spot than if
I had not been there at all, for the trees were so
thick and close that the house could not be
got at save by such blind ways as none but
those who made them could find out. "Why
should you raise so strong a fence round you?"
said I; but Carl told me he felt sure I should
think there was much need of it when I had
heard all that had come to pass since I was last
on the isle.
He then sent for the old crew of Paul's ship,
but I could not guess who they were, till Carl
said, "These, Sir, are some of the men who owe
their lives to you.''
Then one by one they came up to me, not as if
they had been the rough crew of a ship, but like
men of rank who had come to kiss the hand of
their king.
The first thing was for me to hear all that had
been done in the isle since I left it.
I must make a short pause in this part of my
tale, and state that when I was last on the isle I
sent off Carl and Jaf to the main land to fetch
some of Carl's friends who had been cast on shore
DO YOU NOT KNOW M£.?
125
there on their way from Spain. Of course I had
no hope then that a ship was so near to take me
to the land of my birth. So when Carl and Jaf
came back to the isle they found that I had gone,
and that five strange men were there in my place.
These five men were part of the crew who had
thrust Paul out of his ship. Two of them, whose
names were Sam and Joe, were not so bad as their
three mates, who were a set of great rogues, and
were led by one of the name of Will. When I
left the isle in Paul's ship, I took Sam and Joe on
board with me, but just as I was on the point
to sail, they got out one of the ship's boats and
went back to the isle, to join their three friends.
I will now go on to tell, just as I heard it from
Carl, all that had come to pass since I had left
the isle. When Will and his men saw that their
two mates had come to join them, they would have
no more to do with them, nor would they let them
have a share in the house, nor food to eat. So
Sam and Joe had to live as well as they could by
hard work, and they set up their home on the
north shore of the isle, where they built huts and
sheds, and made a farm.
To be just to Will, I must here state that bad
as he was, he did two kind things, when Carl and
his friends came back to the isle, for he gave them
food to eat, and he put my note in Carl's hands,

127
as well as a long scroll on which I had set down
how they were to bake the bread, bring up the
tame goats, plant the corn, dry the grapes, and
make pots and pans, just as I had done.
For some time all went on well with Carl and
his men in my old home. They had the use of
the house and the cave, and went in and out just
as they chose. Carl and Jaf did the work,
and as for Will and his friends, all they did was
to shoot birds, and roam on the shore. When
they came home at night, they sat down to eat of
all the good things in the house, for which they
gave no thanks, and like the dog in the ox's stall,
when they did not care to eat, they would not let
the rest do so. Of such small things as these it
would not be worth my while to tell, but that at
last they broke out in a fierce strife with the rest,
and their spite grew to such a pitch that flesh and
blood could not stand it.
When Carl—whom I shall now call the "Chief,"
as he took the lead of all the rest—first came
back from the main land, he would have let all
the five men of Paul's crew live in the house, and
be good friends if they could; but the three rogues
would not hear of it, so the Chief gave poor Sam
and Joe corn for seed, as well as some peas
which I had left on the isle, and they soon learnt
to dig and plant, and hedge in their land, in the
Robinson Crusoe—4,
"HE HELD OUT HIS HAND."1

129
mode which I had set for them, and in short to
lead good lives.
When the three bad men saw this, they were
full of spite, and set to work to tease and vex
them. They told them that the isle was their
own, and that no one else had a right to build on
it if they did not pay them rent. Sam and Joe
thought at first that this was a joke, and said,
"Come and sit down, and see what fine homes
we have built; then tell us what rent you wish us
to pay, and in what coin you would like to have it.''
But Will soon made it plain that they were not
in jest; for he set fire to a torch and put it to the
roof of the hut, and would have burnt it down,
had not Joe set his foot on the torch and put out
the flame. This made Will so full of rage, that
he ran at him with a pole which he had in his
hand, and a fierce fight then took place, the end
of which was that the three rogues had to run off.
But in a short time they came back, trod down
the corn, and shot the young kids, which the poor
men had got to bring up tame.
At last the spite of Will and his friends grew to
such a pitch, that one night they set off with fire-
arms to kill poor Sam and Joe while they slept.
But when they came to their huts no one was to
be found; so quoth Will, ",Ha! here's the nest,
but the birds are flown!" Then they fell to work
\ V
THEY DREW LOTS AMONG THEMSELVES
131
to pull down all that they could lay their hands
on, and left not a stick, nor so much as a sign to
show where the huts had stood; and they tore up
all the young trees by the roots, and flung them
far and wide.
When Carl and his friends heard of these foul
deeds, it made their blood boil, but all that Will
had to say was, '.'You, Sir Jacks of Spain, shall
have the same sauce if you do not mend your
ways." So Carl took from them their guns and
knives, and had them set in chains. As soon as
they had time to feel the pain of this kind of life,
the three rogues grew more cool, and sought to
make peace, and to get back their arms, and live
at large. The Chief told them that in time he
would set them free, but that he could not let
them live in the house, nor give them their arms
for three or four months.
At last they came to beg that Carl and his
men would take them in once more, and give
them bread to eat, as they had no food but
eggs all that time. But the Chief said that he
would not yield till they had sworn to build
up the huts which they had torn down. So they
did.
One day a whim took Will and his two friends
that they would go to the main land to try if they
could seize some of the red men, and bring them home as slaves, to do the hard part of their work
for them.
Carl would have been glad to get rid of men
whom he could not well trust from day to day,
but told them in good faith how rash he thought
his plan was. Yet as their minds were made up,
he gave them from the stores all that they could
want, and a large boat to go in; and when the
rest of the men bade them "good speed," none
thought they would find their way back to the isle.
But lo! in the course of three weeks they did in
truth come home. They said they had found the
land in two days, and that the red men gave them
roots and fish to eat, and they brought with them
eight slaves, three of whom were men, and five
were girls. So they gave their good hosts an axe,
a spade, a screw, and an old key, and brought off
the slaves in the boat.
As to the young girls, Carl and the rest of the
men from Spain did not care to wed them, so the
five men from Paul's crew drew lots for the choice,
and each had one of them for a wife, while the
male slaves were set to work for the good of all,
though there was not much for them to do. But
one of them ran off to the woods, and was not
to be found, and as some of the wild tribes had
been on the isle to feast and dance, Carl had good
cause to fear that he might have gone back with
them, and that if he got safe home, he would be
sure to tell his tribe of the white men's haunts so
near at hand.
One night Carl felt a great weight on his mind,
and could get no sleep. He lay still for some time,
yet as he did not feel at ease, he got up and took
a look out, but as the night was too dark for him
to see, he went back to his bed once more. Still
it was of no use, for though he knew not why,
his thoughts would let him have no rest; he then
woke up one of his friends, and told him how it
had been with him. "Say you so?" said he.
"What if some of the wild tribes have come on
shore, and it is the sound of their boats that woke
you up?"
Then they set off to the top of the hill where I
was wont to go, and from thence they saw through
a glass a fleet of more than a score of boats,
full of men who had bows, darts, clubs, swords of
wood, and such like arms of war; and it was
clear that a horde of some fierce tribe had come
to trap and slay the white men.
Their boats were still far out at sea, so that
Carl and his men had some hours to think what
they should do. Their force was so small that
they thought it wise to hide and lie in wait.
They first made safe their wives and stores in
a thick part of the wood. In the next place, as

soon as £hey saw that the red men had come on
shore, and that they bent their course that way,
V^jf:.;

tff*. fVi
THE KED MEN CAME ON SHORE
they drove all the goats out to stray in the wood
just where they chose that the red men might think
they were wild.
Carl and his men then drew up in a small band,
calm and brave. Two of the wives could not be
kept back, but would go out and fight with bows
and darts. Then Carl, as Chief of the isle, took
the lead, but he put Will at the head of one band
of men, for at this time he had shown such good
faith and such shrewd, keen sense, that all thought
well of his skill and zeal.
As the Chief had not arms for all he did not
give guns to the slaves, but each of them had a
long staff with a spike at the end and an axe to
hang at his side. They took up their post in the
wood near the site of the huts that were burnt
down, and there they lay in wait for the red men.
The foe now came on with a bold and fierce
mien, not in a line, but in crowds here and there,
to the point where Carl lay in wait for them.
When the first band were so near as to be in range
of the guns, Carl gave the word for his men to
shoot at them all at once, so that those who came
up first fell dead on the spot, and great fear and
dread came on the rest.
The Chief and his men then went forth from
the skirts of the wood where they had lain in wait
and fell on the foe from three points with
the butt end of their guns, and swords, and
staves, and they fought so well that the red
men set up a loud shriek and fled for their lives
rHE ENEMY WAS VANQUISHED
137
with all the speed that fear and swift feet could
lend them. As the Chief did not care to give
chase they got safe back to the shore where
their boats lay.
But their rout was not yet at an end, for it
blew a great storm that day, so that the boats
could not put off; and in the night the tide drove
most of them so high on the shore that they could
not be got to sea save with great toil, and the
waves broke some of them to bits.
At dawn of day, when the Chief saw how things
stood, he said: "If we let these men get their
boats out and go back they will make it known
to the rest of the tribes on the main land that we
are here, and there will be no end to our wars as
Jong as we live; but if we keep them here and
treat them well they will not harm us." So to
make sure that they should not leave the isle the
Chief told his men to get some dry wood from
dead trees and set the boats on fire.
When the red men saw this they ran all
round the isle with loud cries as if they were
mad, so that Carl did not know at first what
to do with them, for they trod all the corn
down with their feet, and tore up the vines just
as the grapes were ripe and did a great deal of
harm.
At last the Chief sent old Jaf to tell the red men
-
WE FEED OUR PRISONERS
139
in their own tongue how kind he would be to
them; how he would save their lives and give
them part of the isle to live in if they would
keep in their own bounds; and that they should
have corn and rice to plant and bread to eat till
such time as the crops should be ripe.
The poor men were but too glad to get such
good terms of peace, and they soon learnt to make
all kinds of things with canes and wood, such as
chairs, stools, and beds; and this they did with
great skill when they were once taught. From
this time till I came back to the isle my friends
saw no more of the wild tribes.
When I heard this tale from Carl my heart
beat fast at the thought of the great straits
that he and the rest had been brought through;
and I was glad to find that in so small a space
as my isle (which at first held none but me)
all these tribes of the Great Race should now
live in peace!
I was much struck with the change in the isle,
for the trees had grown, huts had sprung up, and
a great part of the land was sown for crops. As
to Will's hut, it was quite a work of art; it had
strong posts at each point, and the walls and roof
were made of cane work; it had a thatch of straw
from the rice plant, and a huge leaf on the top to
screen it from the sun.
\
I now told Carl that I had not come to take off
his men, but to bring more, and to give them all
such things as they might want to guard their
homes and cheer their hearts.
The next day I made a grand feast for them, and
the ship's cook came on shore to dress it. We
brought out some of our rounds of salt beef and
pork, a bowl of punch and some beer and French
wines, while Carl gave the cook five whole kids
to roast, three of which were sent to the crew on
board ship, that they on their part might feast on
fresh meat from the shore.
I gave the men coats, shirts, hats, shoes and all
kinds of clothes, both for warm and cold days, with
gowns and shawls for their wives, and I need not
say how glad they were of such gifts. Then I
brought out a good stock of tools, from which
each man had a spade, a rake, an axe, a crow, a
saw and a knife, as well as arms and all that they
could want for the use of them.
As I now saw that there was good will on all
sides I brought on shore the youth and the girl
whom I took from the wreck when they were half
dead for want of food. The girl had been brought
up with care, and all the crew had a good word
for her. Both she and the youth felt a wish to be
left on the isle, as well as the French priest; so I
gave them each a plot of ground.
I had brought out with me men of skill to work
on the isle, one of whom could turn his hand
to all sorts of things, so I gave him the name of
"Jack of all trades."
One day the French priest came to me to ask
if I would leave my man Friday on the isle.
"For through him," said he, "I could talk to
the red men in their own tongue and teach them
the things of God; and need I add, it was for
this cause that I came here." I felt that I could
not part with my man Friday for the whole world,
so I told the priest that if I could have made up
my mind to leave him, I was quite sure that Friday
would not leave me.
When I had seen that all things were in a good
state on the isle, I set to work to put my ship in
trim that I might once more quit these shores.
As I was on my way to the ship the youth whom
I spoke of just now came up to me and said: "Sir,
you have brought a priest with you, and while you
are still here we wish him to wed two of us." I
made sure that one of these must be the maid
that I had brought in my ship, and that it was the
wish of the young man to make her his wife. So
I spoke to him with some warmth in my tone and
bade him turn it well in his mind first, as the girl
had not been brought up in the same rank of life
as he had. But he said with a smile that I had
143
made a wrong guess, for it was "Jack of all
trades'' that he had come to plead for.

MADE HER KNEEL BY HIM
It gave me great joy to hear this, as I knew
the girl was as good as she could be, and I
thought well, too, of Jack; so on that day I gave
her to him to be his wife. They were to have
a large piece of ground where they might grow
their crops, with a house to live in, and sheds for
their goats and stores.
The isle was now set out in this way: all the
west end was left waste, so that if the wild tribes
should land on it, they might come and go, and
hurt no one. The old house .was to be the
Chief's, with all its woods, which now spread
out as far as the creek, while the south end
was for the white men and their wives; and
as for the poor red men whose boats we had
burnt, they had the range of the wild part of
the isle.
It struck me that there was one gift which I
had not thought of, and that was the book of
God's Word, which I knew would give them
fresh strength for their work, and help them to
bear the ills of life. So I bade them all come
round me, and as I took up this book of books I
said, "Prize it and lay it to your hearts! for there
are words in it which come from the lips of Christ
our Lord, words which He speaks to us in love,
to win us to Him. Till now you have had no
such book on the isle. No doubt these rich
plains, these crops, these bright waves that wash
the shores which close you in, all prove to you
"%1W '' '.'.,.„.. L> '~';^iS*
THEY WERE MARRIED THAT DAY
10—Robinson Crustt. 145
that there is a Great God, a God of Love; yet
these stop short when they tell us of God's skill
and God's love; they leave as in the dark as to
how we can save our souls. But this book tells
us of a world to come, a bright world of love and
peace—and the way to gain it."
Now that I had been on the isle a month,
on the fifth day of May I once more set sail
with my good Friday, and they all told me
that they should stay there till I came to fetch
them.
I gave one long look at them from the deck,
and then hid my face in my hands.
When we had been out three days, though the
sea was smooth and calm, I saw it look quite
black at one point, and heard one of the crew
give a cry of "Land!" As I knew there was no
coast near, I could not tell what to make of this,
so I sent the mate to the mast head, to find out
with his glass what it was. He came down with
the bad news that it was a fleet of scores and
scores of small boats, full of wild men who came
on fast with fierce looks at us.
As soon as they drew near, I gave the word to
furl all sail and stop the ship, and as I knew that
the worst thing these men could do was to set us
on fire, I had the boats out, and made fast one of
them at the head, and one at the stern.
WE SAID GOOD-BYE TO WILL ATKINS
147
In this way we lay by for the foe, and in a short
time they came up with us, and, as I thought,
meant to close us in. At first they were struck
with awe at the size of the ship, but they soon
came so near to us, that our crew told them by
signs with their hands to keep back, and this,
though we did not mean it, brought on a fight
with them. They shot a cloud of darts at our
boats, which our men kept off with boards for
shields. We did not fire at them, yet in half an
hour they went back out to sea, and then came
straight at us once more.
I bade my men get out the guns, and keep
close, so as to be safe from their darts if they
should shoot, and I then sent Friday on deck to
call out to the wild men in their own tongue, and
ask what they meant to do. It may be that they
did not know what, he said, but as soon as he
spoke to them, I heard him cry out that they
would shoot. This was too true, for they let fly
a thick cloud of shafts, and to my great grief, Fri-
day fell dead. There was no one else in sight,
and he was shot with three darts, three more of
which fell quite near him. I was so mad with
rage that I should have been quite glad to sink
all their boats, so I let the men load five guns
with small shot, and five with large, and we gave
them such a fierce fire as they had never seen.
THE DEATH OF FRIDAY
149
Then a strange scene met our eyes, and no
words can tell the dread and fear that came on
them all; for most of their boats, which were small,
were split and sunk—three or four by one shot.
The rest fled as fast as their oars would take them.
Our boat took up one poor man who swam for
his life, but his speech was so strange to us, that
we could have learnt as much from the sound of
a horn. At first he would not eat or speak, and
we had fears lest he would pine to death, so to
cure him we took him out in the boat and threw
him in the sea, and told him by signs that if he
would not speak or eat, we would not save his
life. He swam round and round the boat, and
at last made signs that he would do as we told
him, so we too^ him in.
When we had taught him to say a few words,
he told us that his tribe and four more had come
out with their kings to have a great fight.
"But what," said I, "made them come up to
us?" At which he said, '' To make you see great
fight!"
So it was for this that poor Friday fell, he who
for long years had been so good and true to me!
My heart sank with grief. We wound him in a
shroud and let him down to his grave in the sea.
And now, with deep grief, I must take my leave
of him.
WE GAVE THEM A FIERCE FIRE
151
We went on with a fair wind to All Saints Bay,
and here I found the sloop I had brought with me
from home, which I meant to send to my isle with
men and stores, when I had learnt how things
stood there.
As one of my crew felt a strong wish to go
back to the isle in it, I said he should by all
means, and I gave him the red man whom we
had on board, for his slave. I found too that a
man who was in fear of the Church of Spain
would be glad to be safe there with his wife and
two girls; so I put them on board the sloop, and
I sent with them three milch cows, five calves, a
horse, four colts, and a score of pigs, all of which,
as I heard, went safe and sound. I have now no
more to say of my isle, as I had left it for the
last time. But the rest of my life was spent for
most part in lands quite as far from home. From
the Bay of All Saints we went straight to the Cape
of Good Hope. Here I made up my mind to
part with the ship in which I had come from the
isle, and to stay on land.
I soon made friends with some men from
France, and two Jews who had come out to the
Cape to trade. I found that some goods which I
had brought with me from home were worth a
great deal, and I made a large sum by the sale of
them, which I laid out in gems.
.WE CAME TO THE TOWN OF CHINO
15*
When we had been at the Cape of Good Hope
nine months, we thought that the best thing we
could do was to hire a ship, and sail to the Spice
Isle to buy cloves; so we got a ship and men to
work her, and set out. We went from port to
port, to and fro, bought and sold our goods,
and spent from first to last, six years in this part
of the world.
At length we thought we would go and seek
new scenes, and by and by we fell in with a strange
set of men, as you who read this tale will say
when you look at the picture.
When we had gone on shore we bought a large
house built with canes, which had a high fence
of the same round it, to keep off thieves, of whom
it seems there are not a few in that land. The
name of the town was Ching, and we found that
the fair or mart, which was held there once a
year, would not take place for three or four
months, so we sent our ship back to the Cape,
as we meant to stay in this part of the world for
some time, and'go from place to place to look
round us, and then come back to the fair at
Ching.
We first went to a town which it was well worth
our while to see; it was quite in the heart of the
land, and was built with straight streets which ran
in cross lines.
HE BLEW ON A KIND OF HORN
155
But I must say, when I came home to the place
of my birth, I was much struck to hear my friends
say such fine things of the wealth and trade of
this part of the world; for I found that the men
were a mere herd of mean slaves, who could
boast of but few arts or works of skill, and that
their ways were well nigh as rough as those of
the red men whom I had left on my isle.
What is their trade to ours, or that of France
and Spain? What are their ports, with a few
junks and barks, to our grand fleets? One of
our large ships of war would sink all their craft,
one line of French troops would beat all their
horse, and the same may be said of ports, which
would not stand for one month such a siege as
we could bring to bear on them. In three weeks'
time we came to their chief town, where we laid
in a large stock of tea, fans, shawls, trays, and
raw silk, which we put on the backs of our mules,
and set out for the North. We had with us some
Scots who had come out to trade here, and had
great wealth.
As we knew that we should run all kinds of
risks on our way, we took a strong force with us,
to keep off the wild hordes who rove from place
to place all through the land. We had five guides,
and all our coin was put in one purse to buy food
on the way, and to pay the men who took charge.
One of us we chose for our chief, to take the
lead in case we should have to fight for our lives;
and when that time came we found that we had
no small need of his skill.
On each side of the road we saw men who
were at work on cups, bowls, and jars, of all
shapes that could be thought of, which they made
out of a fine clay; and this is the ware that has
so wide a fame, and is the chief trade in this par t
of the world.
One thing the guide said he would show me,
which could be seen no where else (and this, in
good sooth, I could not sneer at, as I had done at
most of the things I had seen here), for it was to
be a house all built with the same kind of ware
as the plates and cups that we use are made of,
but much more choice. "How big is this house?"
said I; "can we take it on the mule's back?"
"On the mule's back!" said the guide; "why
two score men live in it." He then took me to
see this strange sight, and it was in truth a large
house, built with laths, on which were hung tiles
of the best ware that can be made out of clay.
It had a bright glaze on it, which shone in the sun
like glass. Down the sides of the house were
leaves and scrolls, drawn with blue paint; and
walls of the rooms were made of small tiles in
all shades of red, blue, and green, with here and
there some gold on them, in rude forms it is true,
but done in good taste; and as the same kind of
earth was made use of to join the tiles, you could
not see where they met. The floors of all the
rooms were of the same kind of ware and so
was the roof; but that was quite black to keep
off the heat of the sun's rays. If I had had
more time to spare, I should have been glad
to see more of this strange place, for there
Were ponds for the fish, as well as walks, courts,
and yards, all of which were made in the same
way.
This odd sight kept me from my friends for
two hours, and when I came up to them, I paid a
fine to our Chief, as he and all the rest had had
to wait for me so long; for we ran a great risk
if we did not keep close to the rest.
In two days' time we came to the Great Wall,
which was built as a fort to guard the land from
the wild tribes that roam at large through the
vast plains to the west. It runs the whole length
of the land, and turns, and winds, and is so high
that it was thought no foe could climb it, or, if
they did, no wall could stop them.
Our Chief gave some of us leave to go out and
hunt, as they call it; but what was it but to hunt
sheep! These sheep, as it fell out, were not
such bad sport, for they are wild and swift of
foot; they go in large flocks, and, like true sheep,
keep close when they flee.
In this hunt, we met with some of the wild
hordes I spoke of, who rove from place to place
in gangs, to rob and kill all they fall in with.
They know no true mode of war or skill in fight,
their arms are not good, and, as to their steeds,
they are but poor lean beasts, and by no means
fit for hard work. *
As soon as these men saw us, they blew some
notes on a kind of horn, the sound of which was
quite new to me. We thought it must be to call
their friends round them, and so it was, for in a
short time a fresh troop of the same size came to
join them, and they were all, as far as we could
judge, a mile off. As soon as one of the Scots
who was with us heard the horn, he said we must
lose no time, but draw up in line, and charge them
at once. We told him we would all fight the
rogues, if he would take the lead.
They stood like a mere crowd, drawn up in no
line, and cast a wild gaze at us. But when they
saw us come at them they let fly their darts,
which, though their aim was true, fell short of us.
We made a halt to fire, then rode at full speed and
fell on them, sword in hand, led by the bold Scot.
As soon as we came up they fled right and left,
but three of them, each of whom had a short sword,
made a stand and did all they could to call the rest
back. Our .Scot rode close up to them, and with
the stock of his gun threw one from his horse, shot
the next, and the third ran off; and this put an
end to the fight. All that we lost were the sheep
we had in chase, for not a man was hurt.
Thus we went on from place to place, and at
length made our way to the chief town of the
'North Seas just a year and a half from the time
when we left Ching.
At last I took ship and set sail for the land of
my birth, which I had left this time for ten years,
nine months and three days.
And now I must bring this tale of my life to a
close; while at the age of three score years and
twelve, I feel that the day is at hand when I must
pray to go forth on that sea of peace and love
which has no waves or shores but those of bliss
which knows no end.
