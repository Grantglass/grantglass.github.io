Of-
LIFE OF
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
I WAS boro in the year 1632, in the city of York,
of a goodly family, though not of that country, my
father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at Hull; he got a good estate by merchandise,
and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York,
from whence he had married my mother, whose re-
lations were named Robinson, a very good family
in that country, and from whom I was called Ro-
binson Kreutzuaer; but by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called, nay, we
call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe; and
80 my companions always called me.
I had two elder brothers, one of whom was a
lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot,
in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous
Colonel Lockhart, who was killed at the battle
near Dunkirk, against the Spaniards; what be-
came of my second brother, I never knew, any
more than my father or mother knew of what was
become of myself.
Being the third eon of the family, and not bred
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early
with rambling thoughts; my father was very aged,
had given me a competent share of learning, as r—

as house education and a country free school gene-
rally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea,
and my inclination to this led me so strongly
against the will, nay, the commands of my father,
and against all the entreaties and persuasions of
my mother and friends, that there seemed to be
something fatal in that propensity of nature tend-
ing directly to the life of misery which was, here-
after, to befal me.
It was almost a year after this, being one day at
Hull, where I went casually, and without any de-
sign of making an elopement, I met one of my
companions who was going to sea to London, in
his father's ship, and pressed me to go wJth him,
telling me it should cost me nothing for my pas-
sage. I consulted neither father nor mother, nor
so much as sent them word, but leaving them to
bear it as they best might, in an ill hour, (God
knows,) on the first of September, 1651,1 went on
board a ship bound for London. Never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner,
or continued longer than mine. The ship was no
sooner out of the Humber, but there arose a vio-
lent storm, and as I had never been at sea before,
I was inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in
mind: I thought the judgments of God deservedly
followed me for my disobedience to my parents.
It was then only that I called to mind the good
advice of my father, and if it pleased God to set
me on dry land once more, I would, like a true re-
penting prodigal, go home to my father.
These wise and sober thoughts continued all the
while the storm continued, and indeed some time
after; but the next day the wind abated, and the
sea grew calmer, and I began to be a little inured
to it; however, I was very grave for all that day,
being a little sea-sick; but towards night the
weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and
a charming evening followed; the sun went down
perfectly clear, and rose so, the next morning, hav-
ing little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun
shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the
most delightful that I ever saw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with
wonder upon the sea that was rough and terrible
the day before, and could be so pleasant in so very
short a time after. And now, lest my good resolu-
tions should continue, my companion, who had en-
ticed me away, comes to me, "Well, Bob," says
he, clapping me upon the shoulder, "how do you
do after it? I warrant you were frightened, wa'n't
yon, last night, when it blew a capful of wind?"
"A capful, do you call it?" said I; "'twas a dread-
ful storm." "A storm, you fool, you!" replied
he; "and do you call that a storm? Why, it is
nothing at all. Give us but a good ship, and sea-
room, and we thing nothing of such a squall of
wind as that; but, you are a fresh water sailor,
Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and
we'll forget all that. Do you see what charming
weather 'tis now?" To make short this sad part
of my story, we went the way of all sailors: the
punch was made, and I was made half-drunk with
it, and in that one night's wickedness I drowned
all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past
conduct, and all my resolutions for the future. la
a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness
of surface, and settled calmness, by the abatement
of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being
over, my fears and apprehensions of being swal-
lowed up by the sea being forgot, and the current
of my former desires returning, I entirely forgot
A S
the vows and promises which I made in my dis-
tress. I found indeed some intervals for reflection,
and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endea-
vour to return again sometimes; but I shook them
off, and roused myself from them, as it were from
a distemper: and applying myself to drinking and
company, soon mastered the return of those fits,
(for so I called them): and I had, in five or six
days, got as complete a victory over conscience, as
any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled
with it, could desire. But I was to have another
trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases
it generally does, resolved to leave me entirely
without excuse; far, if I would not take this for a
deliverance, the next would be such a one, as the
worst and most hardened wretch among us would
confess both the danger and the mercy.
The sixth day of our being at sea, we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
since the storm. Here we were obliged to come
to an anchor; and here we lay, the wind continu-
ing contrary, viz., at S. W., for seven or eight
days, during which time a great many ships from
Newcastle came into the same roads, as a common
harbour, where the ships might wait for a wind
for the river.
We had not, however, rode here so long, and
we should have tided it op the river, but that the
wind blew too fresh; and, after we had laid four
or five days, it blew very hard. However, the
Roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the an-
chorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong,
our men were unconcerned, and not in the least
apprehensive of danger, and spent the time in rest
and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the
eighth day in the morning the wind increased, and
we had all hands at work to strike our top-masts,
and made everything snug and close, that the ship
might ride as easy as possible. By noon, the sea
went very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle
in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or
twice our anchor had come home; upon which our
master ordered out the sheet anchor, so that we
rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables
veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed;
and now I began to see terror and amazement in
the faces even of the seamen themselves. The
master, though vigilant in the business of preserv-
ing the ship, yet, as he went in and out of his
cabin by me, I could hear him, softly to himself,
say several times, "Lord be merciful to us! we
shall all be lost! we shall be all undone!" and the
like. During these first hurries I was stupid,
lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage,
and cannot describe my temper. I could ill re-
sume my first patience, which I hail so apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myself against. I
thought the bitterness of death had been past;
and that this would be nothing too, like the first.
But when the master himself came by me, as I
said just now, and said we should all be lost, I
was dreadfully frightened. I got up out of my
cabin and looked out; but such a dismal sight I
never saw; the sea went mountains high-, and
broke upon us every three or four minutes. When
I could look about, I could see nothing but dis-
tress around us. Two ships that rid near41s we
found had cut their masts by the board, beingfdeep
laden; and our men cried out, that a ship, which
rid about a mile ahead, of us, was foundered. Two
rrore ships, being driven from their anchors, were
run out of the roads to sea, at all adventures, and
not with a mast standing.
Towards the evening, the mate or boatswain
begged the master of our ship to let them cut
away the foremast, which he was very unwilling
to do; but the boatswain protesting to him, that
if he did not, the ship would founder, he consented:
and when they had cut away the foremast, the
mainmast stood loose, and shook the ship so much,
that they were obliged to cut her away also, and
make a clear deck.
The storm continued with such fury, that the
seamen themselves acknowledged they had never
seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she was
deep laden, and was swallowed in the sea, that the
seamen every now and then cried out she would
founder. It was my advantage, in one respect,
that I did not know what they meant by founder,
till I inquired. However, the storm was so vio-
lent, that I saw what was not often seen, the
master, the boatswain, and some others more
sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expect-
ing every moment that the ship would go to the
bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all
our distresses, one of the men who had been down
on purpose to see, cried out we had sprung a leak;
another said, there was four feet of water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to the punjp.
At that very word, my heart, as I thought, died
within me; and I fell backwards upon the side of
the bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the
men roused me, and told me, that I who was able
to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as
another; at which I stirred up, and went to the
pomp, and worked very heartily. While this was
doing, the master, seeing some light colliers who,
not able to ride the storm, were obliged to slip
and ran away to sea, and would not come near us,
ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I,
who knew nothing what that meant, was so sur-
prised, that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a
time when everybody had his own life to think of,
nobody minded me, or what was become of me:
but another man stepped up to the pump, and
thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, think-
ing I had been dead; and it was a great while
before I came to myself.
The master continued firing guns for help, and a
light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us,
turned a boat out to help us. It was with the ut-
most hazard the boat came near us; but it was im-
possible for us to get on board, or for the boat to
lie near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing
very heartily, and venturing their lives to save
ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with
a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length,
which they, after much labour and hazard, took
hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern,
and got all into their boat.
We were not much more than a quarter of an
hour out of our ship, when we saw her sink: and
then I understood, for the first time, what was
meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must ac-
knowledge I had hardly eyes to look up, when the
seamen told me she was sinking; for, from that
moment, they rather put me into the boat, than
that I might be said to go in; my heart was, as it
were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly
with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was
yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the
shore, we could see (when our boat mounted the
waves, we were able to see the shore) a great
many people running along the strand to assist na
when we should come near. But we made but slow
way towards the shore; nor were we able to reach
the shore, till, being paat the light-house at Win-
terton, the shore falls off to the westward towards
Cromer; and so the land broke off a little in the
violence of the wind. Here we got in; and,
though not without much difficulty, got all safe on
shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth,
where, as unfortunate men, we were used with
great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the
town, who assigned us good quarters, as by parti-
cular merchants ami owners of ships; and had
money given us sufficient to carry us either to
London, or back to pull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the sense to have gone back to
Hull, and had gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our blessed Saviour's pa-
rable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for
hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in
Yarmouth roads, it was a great while before he
had assurance that I was not drowned.
The evil influence which carried me first away
from my father's house, which hurried me into the
wild and undigested notion of raising my fortune,
and that impressed those conceits so forcibly upon
me, as to make me deaf to all good advice, and to
the entreaties, and even commands, of my father:
I say the same influence, whatever it was, pre-
sented the most unfortunate of all enterprises to
my view; and I went on board a vessel bound to
the coast of Africa, or, as our sailors vulgarly call
it, a voyage to G linea.
It was my lot, first of all, to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always hap-
pen to such loose and unguarded young fellows as
I then was; the devil generally not omitting to
lay some snare for them very early; but it was not
bo with me. I first fell acquainted with the mas-
ter of a ship who had been on the coast of Guinea,
and who having had very good success there, was
resolved to go again. The captain, taking a fancy
to my conversation, which was not disagreeable at
that time, hearing me say I had a mind to see the
world, told me, if I would go the voyage with him,
I should be at no expense; I should be his mess-
mate, and his companion; and if I could carry any
thing with me, I should have all the advantage of
it that the trade would admit; and perhapsl might
meet with some encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and, entering into a strict
friendship with the captain, he was an honest,
plain-dealing man, went the voyage with him; and
carried a small adventure with me which, by the
disinterested honesty of my friend the captain, I
increased very considerably; for I carried about
£40 in toys and trifles as the captain directed me
to buy. This £40 I had mustered together by the
assistance of some of my relations whom I corres-
ponded with, and who, I believe, got my father, or
at least my mother, to contribute so much as that
to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may say was
successful in all my adventures, and which I owe
to the integrity and honesty of my friend the cap-
tain, under whom I also got a competent know-
ledge of the mathematics, and the rules of naviga-
tion: learned how to keep an account of the ship's
course, take an observation, and, in short, to
understand soms things that were needful to be
understood by a sailor; for, as he took delight to
instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a
word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a
merchant, for I brought home five pounds nine
ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yield-
ed to me in London, at my return, about £300;
and thus filled me with aspiring thoughts which
have since so completed my ruin.
Yet, even in this voyage, I had my misfortunes
too: particularly that I was continually sick;
being thrown into a violent calenture by the exces-
sive heat of the climate, our principal trading being
upon the coast from the latitude of 15 degrees N.,
even to the Line itself.
I was now set up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying soon after his
arrival, I resolved to go the same voyage again,
and I embarked in the same vessel with one who
was tne mate in the former voyage, and had got
the command of the ship. This was the unhappiest
voyage that ever man made; for though I did not
carry quite £400 of my new-gained wealth, so that
I had £200 left, and which I lodged with my
friend's widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell
into terrible misfortunes in this voyage: and the first
was this, viz., our ship, making her course towards
the Canary islands, or rather between those islands
and the African shore, was surprised in the grey of
the morning by a Moorish rover of Sallee, who gave
chase to us with all the sail she could make. We
crowded also as much canvass as our yards would
spread, or our masts carry, to have got clear; but
finding the pirate gained upon us, and would cer-
tainly come up with us in a few hours, we pre-
pared to fight; our ship having twelve guns and
the rogue eighteen. About three o'clock in the af-
ternoon he came up with ns, and bringing to by mis-
take, just athwart our quarter, instead of athwart
our stern, as he intended, we brought eight of our
guns to bear on that side, and poured in a broad-
side upon him, which made him sheer off again,
after returning our fire, and pouring in also his
small shot from near 230 men. However, we had
not a man touched, all our men keeping close. He
prepared to attack us again, and we to defend our-
selves ; but, laying us on board next time upon our
other quarter, he entered ninety men upon our
decks, who immediately fell to work, cutting and
hacking the decks and rigging. We plied them
with some small shot, halt-pikes, powder-chests,
and such like, and cleared our decks of them -twice.
However, to cut short this part of our tale, our
ship being disabled, and three of our men killed
and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield ; and
were all carried prisoners into Sallee, a port which
belonged to the Moors.
Tbe usage I had there was not so dreadful as at
first I apprehended; neither was I carried up the
country to the emperor's court, as the rest of our
men were, but was kept by the captain of the
rover as his proper prize, and made his slave, being
young and nimble, and fit for his business. At
this surprising change in my circumstances, from
a merchant to a miserable slave, I was perfectly
overwhelmed; and now I looked back upon my
father's prophetic discourse to me, that I should be
miserable, and have none to relieve me, which I
thought was now so effectually brought to pass,
that I could not be worse; and now the band of
Heaven had overtaken me, and I was undone
without redemption. But, alas! this was but a
taste of the misery I was to go through, as will
appear in the sequel of this story.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his house, so I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to sea again, believing
that it would be some time or other his fate to be
taken by a Spanish or Portuguese man-of-war;
and that theu I should be set at liberty: But this
hope of mine was soon taken away; for, when he
went to sea, he left me on shore to look after his
little garden, and do the common drudgery of slaves
about his house; and when he came home again
from his cruise, he ordered me to lie in the cabin,
and look after the ship.
After about two years, an odd circumstance pre-
sented itself, which put the thought of making
some attempt for my liberty again in my head.—
My patron lying at home longer than usual without
fitting out his ship, which, I had heard, was for
want of money, he used constantly, once or twice
a-week, sometimes oftener if the weather was fair,
to take the ship's pinnace, and go out into the
Roads a-fishing; and as he always took me and a
young Moresco with him to row the boat, we
made very merry, and I proved dexterous in catch-
ing fish; insomuch that sometimes he would send
me with a Moor, one of his kinsmen, and the young
Moresco, as they called him, to catch a dish of fish
for him.
It happened once, that going a-fishing with him
one very calm morning, a fog arose so thick, that
although we were not half a league from the shore,
we entirely lost sight of it; and, rowing we knew
not whither or which way, we laboured all day,
and all the next night; aud when the morning
came, we found we had pulled off to sea, instead
jpf pulling in for the shore, and that we were at
least two leagues from the land. However we got
well in again, though with a great deal ot labour
and some danger; for the wind began to blow
pretty fresh in the morning; but particularly, we
were all very hungry.
But our patron, warned by this disaster, re-
solved to take more care of himself for the future;
and having lying by him the long boat of our Eng-
lish ship, which he had taken, he resolved he would
not go a-fishing any more without a compass, and
some provision; so he ordered the carpenter of his
ship, who was also an English slave, to build a
little state room or cabin in the middle of the long
boat, like that of a barge, with a place to stand
behind it to steer, and haul home the main sheet;
and room before for a hand or two to stand and
work the sails. She sailed with what we called
the shoulder of mutton sail; and the boom jibbed
over the top of the cabin, which lay very snug and
low, and had in it room for him to lie with a slave
or two, and a table to eat on, with some small
lockers to put in some bottles of such liquor as he
thought fit to drink; particularly his bread, rice,
and coffee.
We were frequently out with his boat a-fishing;
and as I was most dexterous to catch fish for him,
he never went without me. It happened one day
that he had appointed to go out in his boat, either
for pleasure or for fish, with two or three Moors of
some distinction, and for whom he had provided
extraordinary, and had therefore sent on board the
boat overnight a larger stock of provisions than
usual; and had ordered me to get ready three fu-
sils, with powder and shot, which were on board
his ship, for they had designed some part of fowl-
ing as well as fishing.
I got all things ready, as he had directed; and
waited the next morning with the boat washed
clean, her ancients and pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his guests; when, by and
by, my patron came on board alone, and told me
his guests had put off going, upon some business
that fell out, and ordered me with the man and
boy, as usual, to go out with the boat, and catch
them some fish, for that his friends were to sup at
his house. He commanded me, too, that as soon
as I had got some fish, I should bring it home to
his house, all which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was
like to have a little ship at my command; and my
master being gone, I prepared to furnish myself,
not for fishing business, but for a voyage; though
I knew not, neither did I so much as consider,
whither I should steer; for any way to get out of
that place was my way.
My first contrivance was to make a pretence to
speak to this Moor, to get something for our sub-
sistence on board, for I told him we must not pre-
sume to eat of our patron's bread. He said, that
was true; so he brought a large basket of rusk or
biscuit, of their kind, and three jars of fresh water
into the boat. I knew where my patron's case of
bottles stood, which, it was evident by the make,
were taken out of some English prize, and I con-
veyed them into the boat, while the Moor was on
shore, as if they had been there before for our mas-
ter. I conveyed also a great lump of bees wax
into the boat, which weighed about an hundred
weight, with a parcel of twine or thread, a hatchet,
a saw, and a hammer, all of which were of great
use to us afterwards; especially the wax to make
candles. Another trick I tried upon him, which
he innocently came into also. His name was Ish-
roael, whom they called Muley, or Moley; so 1
called to him, " Moley," said I, " our patron's guns-
are all on board the boat; can you not get a little
powder and shot? it may be we may kill some al-
comies (a fowl like our curlews) for ourselves; for
I knew he kept the gunner's stores in the ship."
"Yes," said he, "I'll bring some." Accordingly
be brought a great leather pouch, which held about
a pound and a half of powder, or rather more;
and another with shot, that had five or six pounds,
•with some bullets, and put all into the boat. At
the same time, I had found some powder of my
master's in the great cabin, with which I filled
one of the large bottles in the case, which was
almost empty, pouring •what was in it into an-
other: and thus furnished with everything needful,
we sailed out of the port to fish. The castle,
which is at the entrance of the port, knew who
we were, and took no notice of us; and we were
not above a mile out of port, before we hauled
in our sail, and sat down to fish. The wind blew
from N. N. E, which was contrary to my desire;
for had it blown southerly I had been sure to
have made to the coast of Spain, and, at least,
reached to the Bay of Cadiz; but my resolutions
were, blow which way it would, I would be gone
from that horrid place where I was, and leave the
rest to fate.
After we had fished some time, and catched
nothing (for when I had fish on my hook, I would
not pull them up, that he might not see them), I
said to the Moor, "This will not do: our master
will not be thus served. We must stand farther
off." He, thinking no harm, agreed; and being in
the head of the boat, set the sails, and, as I bad
the helm, I ran the boat out near a league farther,
and then brought her to, as if I would fish: when,
giving the boy the helm, I stepped forward to
where the Moor was, and making as if I stooped
tor something behind him, I took him by surprise,
put my arm under his waist, and tossed him over-
board into the sea. He rose immediately, for he
cwiim like a cork, and called to me, begged to be
token in, telling me he would go over the world
with me. He swam so strong after the boat, that
he would have reached me very quickly there,
being bat little wind, upon which I stepped into
the cabin, and fetching one of the fowling-pieces,
I presented it at him, and told him I had done him
no hurt, and if he would be quiet, I would do him
none. "But," said I, "yon swim well enough to
reach the shore, and the sea ie calm; make the
best of your way to the shore, and I will do you
nO harm: but if you come near the boat, I'll shoot
you through the head, for I am resolved to have
my liberty." So he turned himself about and
swam for the shore, and I make no doubt but he
reached it with ease, for he was an excellent
swimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this
Moor with me, and have drowned the boy, but
there was no venturing to truat him. When he
was gone, I turned to the boy, whom they called
Xury, and said to him, " Xury, if you will be faith-
ful to me, I'll make you a great man: but if you
will not, stroke your face to be true to me," that
ia, swear by Mahommed, and his father's beard,
"I must throw you into the sea too." The boy
smiled in my face, and spoke so innocently, that I
could not mistrust him: and swore to be faithful to
me, and go all over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was
swimming, I stood out directly to sea with the
boat, rather stretching to windward, that fcey
might think me gone towards the Strait's mouth,
(indeed, any one that had been in their wits must
have been supposed to do so); for who would havs
supposed we were sailing on to the southward, to
the truly barbarian coasts, where whole nations of
Negroes were sure to surround us with their ca-
noes, and destroy us; where we could nerer once
go on shore, but we should be devoured by savage
beasts, or no more merciless savages of the human
kind.
But, as soon as it grew dark in the evening, I
changed my course, and steered directly south and
by east, bending my course a little towards the
east that I might keep in with the shore; and,
having a fair fresh gale of wind, and a smooth
quiet sea, I made such sail, that I believe, by the
next day at three o'clock in the afternoon, when I
first made the land, I could not be less than one
hundred and fifty miles south of Sallee, quite be-
yond the Emperor of Morocco's dominions, or,
indeed, of any other king thereabouts, for we saw
no people.
Yet such was the fright I had taken at the
Moors, that the dreadful apprehensions I had of
falling into their hands, that I would not stop, or
go on shore, or come to an anchor, the wind con-
tinuing fair till I had sailed in that manner five
days; and then the wind shifting to the south-
ward, I concluded also, that if any of our vessels
were in chase of me, they also would now give
over: so ventured to make to the coast, and came
to an anchor in the mouth of a little river, I knew
not what or where, neither what latitude, what
country, what nation, or what river. I neither
saw nor desired to see any people; the principal
thing which I wanted was fresh water.
We came into this creek in the f veiling, resolv-
ing to swim on shore as soon as it was dark, and
discover the country; but as soon as it was quite
dark, we heard such dreadful noises of the bark-
ing, roaring, and howling of wild creatures, of we
knew not what kinds, the poor boy was ready to
die with fear, and begged of me not to go on shore
till day. "Well, Xury," said I, "then I won't;
B
but it may be we may see men by day, who will
be as bad to us as those lior.s." "Then we may
give them the shoot gun," says Xury, laughing,
"make them run away." Such English Xury
spokej by conversing among us slaves. However,
I was glad to see the boy so cheerful, and I gave
him a dram (out of my patron's case of bottles) to
cheer him up. After all, Xury's advice was good,
and I took it: we dropped our little anchor, and
lay still all night; I say still, for we slept none:
for in two or three hours we saw vast great crea-
tures, we knew not what to call them, of many
sorts, come down to the sea-shore, and run into the
water, wallowing and washing themselves for the*
pleasure of cooling themselves; and they made
such hideous howlings and yellings that, I never
indeed heard the like.
Xury was dreadfully frightened, and indeed so
was I too; but we were both worse frightened
when we heard one of the mighty creatures come
swimming towards our boat; we could not see him,
but we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
strous huge and furious beast. Xury said it was
a lion, and that it might for ought I know. Poor
Xury cried out to me to weigh anchor and row
away. "No," says I, "Xury, we can slip our
cable with a buoy to it, and so go to sea; they
cann.it follow ns far." I had no sooner said so,
but I perceived the creature (whatever it was)
within two oars' length, which somewhat sur-
prised me; however, I immediately stepped to the
cabin door, and taking up my gun, fired at him,
upon which he immediately turned about, and
swam towards the shore again.
As I had one voyage to this coast before, I knew .
very well that the islands of the Canaries and the
Cape de Verd Islands also, lay not far off from
the coast. But as I had no instruments to take
observations to know what latitude we were in,
and did not exactly know, or at least not remem-
ber what latitude they were in, I knew not where
to look for them, or when to stand off to Sea to-
wards them, otherwise I might now easily httve
found some of these islands. But my hope was,
that if I stood along this coast till I came to that
part where the English traded, I should find some
of their vessels upon their usual design of trade
that would relieve and take us in.
By the best of my calculations, that place where
I now am must be that country, which lying be-
tween the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the
Negroes, lies waste and uninhabited except by
wild beasts, the Negroes have abandoned it and
pone farther south, for fear of the Moors; and the
Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reason
of its barrenness, and indeed both forsaking it be-
cause of the prodigious number of tigers, lions,
leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour
there so, that the Moors use it for their hunting
only, where they go like an army, two or three
thousand men at a time; and indeed for near a
hundred miles together upon this coast, we saw-
nothing but a waste uninhabited country by day,
and heard nothing but bowlings and roaring of
wild beasts by night.
We made on to the southward, living very spar-
ingly on our provisions, which began to abate
very much, and going no oftener to the shore than
we were obliged for fresh water. My design in
this was to make the river Gambia or Senegal,
that is to say, any where about the Cape de Verd,
where I was in hopes to meet with some European
ship; and if I did, I knew not what course 1 had
to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there
among the Negroes. I knew that all the ships
from Europe, which sailed either to the coast of
Guinea, or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made
this cape or those islands, and, in a word, I put
the whole of my fortune upon this single point,
either that I must meet with some ship or must
perish.
When I had pursued this resolution about ten
days longer, as I have said, I began to see that the
land was inhabited; and in two or three places, as
we sailed by, we saw people standing upon the
shore to look at us; we could also perceive they
were quite black, and stark naked. I was once
inclined to have gone on shore to them, but Xury
was my better counsellor, and said to me "No go,
No go." However, I hauled in nearer the shore,
that 1 might talk to them, and I found they ran
along the shore by me a good way. I observed
they had no weapons in their hands, except one,
who had a long slender stick, which Xury said was
a lance, and that they would throw them a great
way with good aim: so I kept at a distance, but
talked with them by signs as well as I could, and
particularly made signs for something to eat. They
beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would
fetch me some meat. Upon this I lowered the top
of my sail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into
the country, and in less than half an hour came
back, and brought with them two pieces of dry
flesh and some corn, such as is the produce of their
country; but we neither knew what one nor the other
was: however we were willing to accept it. But
how to come at it, was our next dispute, for I was
not for venturing on shore to them, and they were
as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for
ns all, for they brought it to the shore and laid it
down, and went and stood a great way off, till we
fetched it on board, and then came close to ns
again.
We made signs of thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportu-
nity offered that instant to oblige them wonder-
fully; for while we were lying by the shore, came
two mighty creatures, one pursuing the other (as
we took it) with great fury, from the mountain to-
wards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing
the female, or whether they were in sport or rage,
we could not tell, any more than we could tell
whether it was usual or strange; but I believe it
was the latter, because, in the first place, those
ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night;
and, in the second place we found the people ter-
ribly fright,•ned, especially the women. The man
that had the lance or dart did not fly from them,
but the rest did. However, as the two creatures
ran directly into the water, they did not seem to
offer to fall upon the Negroes, but plunged them-
selves into the spa, and swam about as if they had
come on their diversion; at last, one of them came
nearer our boat than at first I expected, but I lay
ready for him, for I had loaded my gun with all
possible expedition, and bade Xury load both tie
others. As soon as he came fairly within my reach,
I fired, and shot him directly into the head. Im-
mediately he sunk down into the water, but rose
instantly, and plunged up and down as if he was
struggling for life: and so indeed he was. He im-
mediately made to the shore; but between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the stran-
gling of the water, he died just before he reached
the shore.
It is impossible to express the astonishment of
these poor creatures at the noise mid fire of my
guu; pome of them were even ready to die for fear,
B 3•
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But
when they saw the creature dead, and sunk in the
water, and that I made signs to them to come to
the shore, they took heart and came to the shore,
and began to search for the creature. I found him
by his blood staining the water, and by the help of
a rope, which I flung round him, and gave the
Negroes to haul, they dragged him on shore, and
found that it was a most curious leopard, spotted
and fine to an admirable degree, and the Negroes
held up their hands with admiration, to think what
it was I killed him with.
The other creature, frightened with the flash of
fire, and the noise of the gun, swam to the shore,
and ran up directly to the mountains from whence
they came, nor could I at that distance know what
it was. I found quickly the Negroes were for eat-
ing the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to
have them take it as a favour from me, which, when
I made signs to them that they might take him,
they were very thankful for. Immediately they
fell to work with him, and though they had no
knife, yet with a sharpened piece of wood they
took off his skin as readily, nay, much more rea-
dily, than we would have done with a knife. They
offered me some of the flesh, which I declined,
making as if I would give it them, but made signs
for the skin, which they gave me freely, and
brought me a great deal more of their provision,
which, though I did not understand, yet I accept-
ed. Then I made signs to them for some water,
and held out one of my jars to them, turning its
bottom upwards, to show that it was empty, and
that I wanted to have it filled. They called in-
stantly to some of their friends, and there came
two women who brought a great vessel made of
earth, and burnt, as I suppose, in the sun: this
they set down for me, as before, and I sent Xury
on shore with my jars, and filled them all three.
The women were as naked as the men.
I was now furnished with roots and corn, such
as it was, and water: and leaving my friendly
Negroes, I made forward for about eleven days
more, without offering to go near the shore, till I
saw the land run out a great way into the sea, at
about the distance of four or five leagues before
me, and, the sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing to make this point; at length, doubling the
point, at about two leagues from land, I plainly
saw land on the other side to seaward, then I con-
cluded, as it was most certain indeed, that this
was the Cape de Verd, and those the islands,
called from thence the Cape de Verd Islands.—
However, they were at a great distance, and I
could not tell what was best to do; lor if I should
be taken with a fresh wind, I might neither reach
the one or the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I step-
ped into the cabin, and sat me down, Xury having
the helm, when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,—
"Master, master; a ship without a sail!" and the
silly boy was frightened out of his wits, thinking
it must needs be one of his master's ships sent to
pursue us, when I knew we were gotten far out
of their reach. I jumped out of the cabin and im-
mediately saw not only the ship, but what she
was, namely, that it was a Portuguese ship, and
as I thought, was bound to the coast of Guinea for
Negroes. But when I observed the course she
steered, I was soon convinced she was bound some
other way, and did not design to go any nearer
the shore, upon which I stretched out to sea as
much as I could, resolving to speak with them if
possible; so they shortened sail to let me come up.
I was encouraged with this, and as I had my pa-
tron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to
them for a signal of distress, and fired a gnn, both
of which they saw; for they told me that they saw
the smoke, though they did not hear the gun.—
Upon these signals they very kindly brought to,
and lay by for me; and in about three hours, I
came up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and
in Spanish, and in French, hut I understood noue
of them ; hut at last, a Scotch sailor, who was on
board, called to me, and I answered him, and told
him I was an Englishman: that I had made my
escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee.
Then they bade me come on board, aud very
kindly took me in, and all my goods.
It was an inexpressible joy to me, that any one
will believe, that I was thus delivered, as I ac-
counted it, from such a miserable and almost hope-
less condition as I was in. I immediately offered
all I had to the captain of the ship, as a return for
my deliverance: but he generously told me, he
would take nothing from me, but that all I bad
should be delivered safe to me when I came to the
Brazils. "For," says he, " I have saved your life
on no other terms than as I would be glad to be
saved myself; and it may one time or other be my
Jot to be taken up in the same condition. Be-
sides," said he, "when I carry you to the Brazils,
ao great a way from your own country, if I should
take from you what little you have, you will be
starved there, and then I only take away that life
I have given. No, no," said he, " Signer luglese
(Mr. Englishman), I will carry you thither in
charity, and those things will help you to bay your
subsistence there, and your passage home ajjain."
As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was
just in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered
the seamen that none should offer to touch any-
thing I had, then he took everything into his
own possession, and gave me back an exact inven-
tory of them, that I might have them again, even
eo much as my three earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that
he saw, and told me he would buy it of me for the
ship's use, and asked me what I would have for it.
I told him he had been so generous to me in every-
thing, that I could not offer to make any price on
the boat, but left it entirely to him; upon which
he told me he would give me a note of his hand to
pay me 80 pieces of eight for it at Brazil, and when
it came there, if any one offered to give more, he
would make it up. He offered me also 60 pieces
of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loath
to take; not that I was unwilling to let the cap-
tain have him, but I was very loath to sell the
poor boy's liberty, who had assisted me 10 faith-
fully in procuring my own. However, when I let
him know the reason, he owned it to be just, and
offered me this medinm, that he would give the boy
an obligation to set him free in ten years, if he
turned Christian. Upon this, Xury, saying he was
willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santas, or All
Saints Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And
now I was once more delivered from the most
miserable of all conditions of life; and what to do
next with myself, I was to consider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I
can never enough remember; he would take nothing
of me for my passage, gave me 20 ducats for the
leopard's, and 40 for the lion's skin, which I had
in the boat, and caused everything I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered to me; and what
I was willing to sell, he bought, such as the case
of bottles, two of my guna, and a piece of the
lamp of bees' wax, for I had made candles of the
rest; in a word, I had made about 220 pieces of
eight of all my cargo, and with this stock I went
on shore in the Brazils.
I had not been long here before being recom-
mended to the house of a good honest man like
himself, who had an ingenio, as they call it—that
is, a plantation and a sugar-house, I lived with
him some time, and acquainted myself by that
means with the manner of planting and making
of sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived,
and how they grew rich suddenly, I resolved, if I
could get license to settle tviere, I would turn
planter among them; resolving, in the meantime,
to find out some way to get my money, which I
left in London, remitted to me. To this purpose,
getting a kind of naturalization, I purchased as
much land that was uncured as my money would
reach, and formed a plan for my plantation and
settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to
the stock which I proposed to myself to receive
from England.
I wrote the English captain's widow a full
account of all my adventures, my slavery, escape,
and how I had met with the Portuguese captain at
sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what con-
dition I was now in, with all other necessary direc-
tions for my supply; and when this honest captain
came to Lishon, he found means by some of the
English merchants there, to send over, not the
order only, but a full account of my story to a mer-
chant at London, who presented it effectually to
her; whereupon she not only delivered the money,
but out of her own pocket sect the Portugal cap-
tain a very handsome present for his humanity and
charity to me.
The London merchant vested this £100, in Eng-
lish goods, such as the captain had written for;
sent them directly to Lishon, and he brought them
all safe to me at the Brazils; among which, with-
out any direction, (for I was too young in my
business to think ot them,) he had taken care to
have all sorts of tools, iron-work, and utensils ne-
cessary for my plantation, and which were of great
use to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
was made, for I was surprised with the joy of it;
and my good steward, the captain, had laid out
the £5 which my friend had sent him for a present
for himself, to purchase and bring me over a ser-
vant, under bond for six years' service, and would
not accept of any consideration, except a little to-
bacco, which I would have him accept, being of my
own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
English manufactures, such as cloth, stuff, baize,
and things particularly valuable and desirable in
the country, I found means to sell them to a great
advantage, so that I may say, I had more than four
times the value of my first cargo, and was now in-
finitely beyond my poor neighbours, I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the first thing
I did, I bought myself a negro slave and an Euro-
pean servant also, I mean another besides that
which the captain brought me from Lishon.
But this absurd prosperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greatest adversity, so it was
with me. I went on the next year with great suc-
cess in my plantations; I raised fifty great rolls of
tobacco on my own ground, more than I bad dis-
posed of for necessaries among my neighbour*,
and these fifty rolls of tobacco being each above
lQOlbs. weight, were well cured and laid by against
the return of the fleet from Lisbon. And now in-
creasing much in business and wealth, my head be-
gan to be full of projects and undertakings beyond
my reach, such as are indeed often the ruin of the
best heads in business.
Having now lived almost four years in the Bra-
zils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well
upon my plantation, I had not only learned the
language, but had contracted friendship and ac-
quaintance among my fellow planters, as well as
among the merchants of St. Salvador, which was
our port, and that, in my discourse among them,
I had frequently given them an account of my two
voyages to Guinea, the manner of trading with the
Negroes there, and how easy it was to purchase
upon the coast, for trifles, such as beads, toys,
knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like,
not only gold dust, Guinea grains, elephants' teeth,
&c, but Negroes for the service of the Brazils, in
great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dis-
courses on these heads, but especially to that part
which related to the buying of Negroes, which was
a trade at that time not only not far entered into,
but, as far as it was, had been carried on by the
assientors, on permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock, so
that very few Negroes were bought, and those ex-
cessively dear.
'It happened, being in company one day with
some merchants and planters of my acquaintance,
and talking of those things very earnestly, three of
them came to me the next morning, and told me,
they had been musing very much upon what I had
discoursed with them the last night, and they
came to make a secret proposal to me; and, after
enjoining me to secrecy, they told me they had a
good mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that
they had all plantations as well as I, and were
straitened for nothing so much as servants: and
as it was not a trade that could be carried on, be-
cause they could not publicly sell the Negroes when
they cams> home, so they desired to make but one
voyage, to bring the Negroes on shore privately,
and divHe them among their own plantations;
and, in a word, the question was, whether I would
go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the
trading part upon the coast of Guinea: and they
offered me that I should have my equal share of the
Negroes, without providing any part of the stock.
This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed,
had it been made to any one that had not a settle-
ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very consider-
able, and with a good stock upon it, But for me
that was thus established, and had nothing to do
but to go on as I had begun for three or four years
more, and to have sent for the other hundred
pounds from England, which, in that time, and
with little addition, could scarce have failed of
being worth three or four hundred pounds, and that
increasing, too; for me to think of such a voyage,
was the most preposterous that ever man, in such
circumstances, could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own destroyer,
could no more resist the offer, than I could restrain
my first rambling designs, when my father's good
counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them
I would, with all my heart, if they would under-
take to look after my plantation in my absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct,
if I miscarried. This they all engaged to do, and
entered into writings or covenants to do so: and.I
made a formal will, disposing of my plantations
and effects, in case of my death, making the captain
of the ship my heir, but obliging him to dispose of
my effects as directed in my will; one half of the
produce being to himself, and the other to be shipped
to England.
In short, I took all possible caution to preserve
my effects and keep up my plantation. Had I used
half as much prudence to have looked into my own
interest, and made a judgment of what I ought to
have done and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from so prosperous an under-
taking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving
plantation, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended
with all its common hazards, to say nothing of the
reasons I had to except particular misfortunes to
myself.
But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy, rather than my reason; and
accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an
evil hour again, the 1st of September, 1659, being
the same day eight years that I went from my father
and mother at Hull, in order to act the rebel to
their authority, and the fool to my own interest.
Our ship was about 120 tons burden, and carried
six guus, and fourteen men, besides the master, his
boy, and myself. We had on board no large cargo
of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our
trade with the Negroes; such as beads, bits of
glass, shells, and odd trifles, especially little looking-
glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets, and the like.
The same day I went on board, we set sail,
standing away to the northward upon our own
coast, when they came in about ten or twelve de-
grees, northern latitude, which, it seems, was the
manner of their course in those days. We had
very good weather, only excessive hot all the way
upon our own coast till we came to the height of
Cape St. Augustino, from whence keeping farther
off to sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if
we were bound for the Isle of Fernand de Noroubba,
holding our course N.E. by N., and leaving those
isles on the east. In this course we passed the
Line in about twelve days time, and were by our
last observation, in 7 degrees, 22 minutes, northern
latitude, when a violent tornado or hurricane took
us quite out of our knowledge; it settled in the
north-east, from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve days together we could do
nothing but drive; and scudding away before it, let
it carry us wherever fate and the fury of the winds
directed, and during these twelve days, I need not
say that I expected every day to be swallowed up;
nor did any in the ship expect to save their lives.
In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard,
one of our men, early in the morning, cried out,
"Land I" and we had no sooner run out of the ca-
bin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in
the world we were, but the ship struck upon the
sand, and, in a moment, her motion being so stop-
ped, that the sea broke over her in such a manner
that we expected we should all have perished im-
mediately; and we were even driven into close
quarters to shelter us from the very foam and spray
of the sea. ••i
Tims situated, the mate of our vessel laid hold
of the boat, and with the help of the rest of the
men, they got her flung over the ship's side, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed oursel ves,
being eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the
wild sea: for though the storm was abated consi-
derably, yet the sea went dreadfully high upon the
shore, and might be called, " Den wild zee," as the
Dutch call the sea in a storm.
And now oar case was very dismal indeed; for
we all saw plainly that the sea went so high, that
the boat could not escape, and that we should be
inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had
none, nor if we had, could we have done anything
with it; so we worked at the oars towards the
land, though with heavy hearts, like men going to
execution; for we all knew, that when the boat
came near the shore, she would be dashed to a
thousand pieces by the breach of the sea. How-
ever, we committed our souls to God in the most
earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards
the shore, we hastened our destruction with our
own hands, pulling as well as we could towards
the land.
After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a
league and a half as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain like, came rolling astern of ns, and plainly
bade us expect the coup de grace. In a word, it
took us with such fury, that it overset the boat at
once, and separating us as well from the boat as
from one another, gave ns not time hardly to say,
"Oh, God," for we were ail swallowed up in a mo-
ment.
Nothing can describe the confusion of thought
which I felt when I sunk into the water, for though
I swam very well, yet I could not deliver myself
from the waves so as to draw breath, till a wave
had driven me, or rather carried me, a vast way on
towards the shore, and having spent itself, went
back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but
half dead with the water I took in. I had so much
presence of mind, as well as breath left, that-see-
ing myself nearer the main land than I expected, I
got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make to-
wards land as fast as I could, before another wave
should return, and take me up again. But this I
soon found it was impossible to avoid, for I saw
the sea come after me as high as a great hill, and
as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or
strength to contend with; my business was to hold
my breath, and raise myself on the water, if I
could, and so by swimming, to preserve my breath-
ing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible;
my greatest concern now being that the wave
would carry me back again with it, when it came
back towards the sea.
The wave now came upon me again, buried
me at once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own
body, and I could feel myself carried with a great
force and swiftness towards the shore a very great
way : but I held my breath, and assisted myself to
swim still forward with all my might. I was
ready to burst with holding my breath, when as I
felt myself rising up, so, to my immediate relief, I
found my head and hands shoot above the surface
of the water; and though it was not above two
seconds of time that I could keep myself so, yet it
relieved me greatly, and gave me breath and new
courage. I was covered again with water a long
while, but not so long as I held it out, and finding
the water had spent itself, and began to return, I
struck forward against the return of the waves,
and felt ground again with my feet. I stood still a
few moments to recover breath, and till the water
went from me, and then I took to my heels, and
ran with what strength I had, farther towards the
shore. But neither would this deliver me from the
fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me
again, and twice more was I lifted up by the
waves, and carried forward as before, the shore
being very flat.
The last time of these two had well near been
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather dashed me, against a
piece of rock, and that with such force, as it left
me senseless, and indeed, helpless, as to my own
deliverance; for the blow taking my side and
breast, beat the breath, as it were, out of my body,
and had it returned again immediately, I must
have been strangled in the water; I recovered a
little before the return of the waves, and seeing I
should be covered again with the water, I resolved
to hold fast by a piece of rock, and so to hold my
breath, if possible, till the wave went back.
Now, as the waves were not so high as at first,
being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated,
and then fetched another, run, which brought me so
near the shore, that the next wave, though it went
over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry
me away; and the next run I took, I got to the
msin land, where to my great comfort I clambered
up the cliffs of the shore, and sat down upon the
grass, free from danger, and quite out of reach of
the water.
I walked about upon the shore, lifting up my
hands, and my whole being, wrapt up in the con-
templation of my deliverance, making a thousand
gestures and motions which I cannot describe, re-
flecting upon all my comrades that were drowned,
and that there should not be one soul saved but
myself; for, as for them, I never saw them after-
wards, or any sign of them, excepting three of
their hats, two shoes that were not fellows, and
one cap.
I cast my eyes on the stranded vessel, when the
breach and froth of the sea being so big, I could
hardly see it, it lay so far off; and considered,
Lord, bow is it possible I could get on shore!
After I had solaced my mind with the comfort-
able part of my condition, I began to look round me,
to see what kind of place I was in, and what was
next to be done, and I soon fonnd my comforts
abate, and that, in a word, I had a dreadful deli-
verance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shift
me, nor any thing, either to eat or drink or comfort
me, neither did I see any prospect before me, but
that of perishing with hunger, or be devoured by
wild beasts; and that which was particularly af-
flicting to me was, that I had no weapon, either to
hunt and kill any creature, for my sustenance, or to
defend myself against any other creature that might
desire to kill me for theirs. In a word I had no-
thing about me but a knife, a tobacco pipe and a
little tobacco in a box; this was all my provision,
and this threw me into such terrible agonies of
mind, that for a while I ran about like a madman.
Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
heart to consider what would be my lot, if there
were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing
at night they always come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at
that time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree,
like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the
next day what death I should die; for, as yet, I
saw no prospect of life.
I Walked about a furlong from the shore, to see
if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I
did to my great joy; « nd having drank, and put a
little tobacco in my month, to prevent hunger, I
went to the tree, and getting up into it, endea-
voured to place myself so as that, if I should sleep,
I might not fall; and having cut me a short stick,
like a truncheon, for my defence, I took up my
lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, I
fell fast asleep, and slept as comfortably as I be-
lieve few could have done in my condition; and
found myself the most refreshed with it that I
think I ever was on such an occasion.
When I awaked, it was broad day, the weather
clear, and the storm abated, so that the sea did not
rage and swell as before; but that which surprised
me most, was, that the ship was lifted off, in the
night, from the sand where she lay, by the swelling
of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the
rock, which I first mentioned, where I had been so
bruised by the sea dashing me against it. This
being within about a mile from the shore where I
was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I
wished myself on board, that at least, I might save
some necessary things for my use.
A little after noon I found the sea very calm;
and the tide ebbed so far out, that I could come
within a quarter of a mile of the ship: and here I
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evi-
dently that if we had kept on board we had been
all safe, that is to say, we had all got safe on shore,
and I had not been so miserable as to be left en-
tirely destitute of all comfort and company, as I
now was. This forced tears from mine eyes again;
but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if
possible to get to ihe ship; so I pulled off my
clothes, for the weather was hot to extremity, and
took the water; but when I came to the ship, my
difficulty was still greater to know how to get on
board; for as she lay aground, and high out of the
water, there was nothing within my reach to lay
hold of. I swam round her twice, and the second
time I espied a small piece of rope, which I wonder
I did not see at first, hang down by the forechains
so low as that with great difficulty I got hold of it,
and by the help of that rope, got up in the fore-
castle of the ship.
Here I found that the ship was bulged, and had
a great deal of water in her hold, but that she lay
so on one side of a bank of hard sand or rather
earth, thather stern lay lifted upon the bank, and her
head low almost to the water; and by this means
all her quarter deck was free, and all that was in
that part was dry; for you may be sure my first
work was to Search and to see what was spoiled,
and what was free, and first I found that all the
ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the
water; and being very well disposed to eat, went
to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with
bread, and ate it as I went about other things for
I had no time to lose. I also found some rum in
the great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and
which I had indeed need enough of, to spirit me for
what was before me. Now I wanted nothing but
a boat to furnish myself with many things which I
foresaw would be necessary to me.
It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was
not to be had, and this extremity roused my appli-
cation. We had several spare yards, and two or
three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or
two in the ship; I resolved to fall to work with
these, and flung as many of them overboard as I
could manage for their weight; tying every one
with a rope, that they might not drive away.
When this was done, I went down the ship's side,
and pulling them to me, I tied four of them fast
together at both ends, as well as I could in the
form of a raft; and laying two or three short pieces
of plank upon them crossways, I found I could
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able
to bear any great weight, the pieces being to"
c 2
light; so I went to work, and, with a carpenter's
saw, I cut a spare top-mast into three lengths, and
added them to my raft, with a great deal of labour
and pains; but the hope of furnishing myself with
necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I
would have been able to have done upon another
occasion.
My raft was now strong enough to bear any rea-
sonable weight. My next care was what to load
it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it
from the surf of the sea ; but I was not long con-
sidering this; I first laid all the planks or boards
upon it that I could get, and having considered
well what I most wanted, 1 first got three of the
seamen's chests, which I had broken up and emp-
tied, and lowered them down upon the raft. The
first of these I filled with provisions, viz., bread,
rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried goat's
flesh, which we lived much upon, and a little re-
mainder of European corn, which had been laid by
for some fowls, which we brought to sea with us;
but the fowls were killed; there had been some
barley and wheat together, but to my great disap-
pointment, I found afterwards that the rats had
eaten and spoilt it all. As for liquors, I found
several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper,
in which were some cordial waters, and in all
above five gallons of arrack; these I stowed by
themselves, there being no need to put them into
the chest, nor any room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the tide began to flow, though
very calm, and I had the mortification to see my
coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore
upon the sand, swim away; as for my breeches,
which were only linen, and open knee'd, I swam
on board in them and my stockings. However,
this put me upon rummaging for clothes, of which
I found enough, but took no more than I wanted
for present use, for I had other things which my
eye was more upon; at first, tools to work with
on shore, and it was after long searching that I
found the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a
very useful prize to me, and much more valuable
than a ship load of gold would have been at that
time. I got it down to my raft, even whole as it
was, without losing time to look into it, for I knew
in general what it contained.
My next care was for some ammunition and
arms. There were two very good fowling-pieces
in the great cabin, and two pistols; these I secured
first, with some powder-horns, a small bag of shot,
and two old rusty swords. I knew there were
three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not
where our gunner had stowed them; but with much
search I found them, two of them dry and good,
the third had taken water; these two I got to my
raft, with the arms.
Having got on shore, my next work was to view
the country, and seek a proper place for my habita-
tion, and where to store my goods, to secure them
from whatever might happen. Where I was I yet
knew not; whether on the continent or on an
island; whether inhabited or not inhabited; whe-
ther in danger of wild beasts or not. There was a
hill not above a mile from me which rose up very
steep and high, and which seemed to overtop some
other hills, which lay as in a ridge from it north-
ward. I took out one of the fowling-pieces, and
one of the pistols, and a horn of powder, and, thus
armed, I travelled for discovery up to the top of
that hill, where, after I had with great labour and
difficulty got up, I immediately saw my fate, to my
great affliction, viz., that I was on an island, envi-
roned every way by the sea, no land to be seen,
except some rocks, which lay a great way off, and
two small islands, less than this, which lay about
three leagues to the west.
I found also that the island I waa on was barren,
and, as I saw good reason to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild beasts, of which, however, I saw
none; yet I saw abundance of fowls, but knew not
their, kinds, neither, when I killed them could I tell
what was fit for food, and what not. At my coming
back, I shot at a great bird, which I saw sitting
upon a tree, at the side of a large wood. I believe
it was the first gun that had ever been fired there
since the creation of the world. I had no sooner
fired, but from all parts of the wood there arose an
extraordinary number of fowls, of many sorts,
making a confused screaming and crying, every one
according to his usual note; but not one of them
of any kind that I knew. As for that creature I
killed, I took it to be a kind of hawk, its colour
and beak resembling it, but it had no talons or
claws more than common; its flesh was carrion,
and fit for nothing.
Contented with this discovery, I came back to
my raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on
shore, which took me up the rest of the day.—
What to do with myself at night, I knew not, nor
indeed where to rest; for I was afraid to lie down
on the ground, not knowing but some wild beasts
might devour me, though I afterwards found there
was really no need for those fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricadoed my-
self round with the chests and boards that I had
brought on shore, and made a kind of hut for that
night's lodging; as for food, I yet saw not which
way to supply myself, except that I had seen two
or three creatures, like hares, run out of the wood
where I shot the fowl.
I now began to consider that I might yet get a
great many things out of the ship, which would be
useful to me, and particularly some of the rigging
and sails, and such other things as might come to
hand, and I resolved to make another voyage on
board the vessel if possible; and as I knew that
the first storm that blew must necessarily break
her all in pieces, I resolved to set all other things
apart, till I got everything out of the ship that I
couldsget: then called council, that is to say, in
my thoughts, whether I should take back the raft,
but this appeared impracticable, so I resolved to
go as before, when the tide was done, and I did so,
only that I stripped before I went from my hut,
having nothing on but a checkered shirt, a pair
of linen drawers, and a pair of pumps upon my
feet.
I got on board the ship as before, and prepared
a second raft; and having had experience of the
first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor loaded
it so hard; but yet I brought away several things
very useful to me; as first, in the carpenter's store
I found two or three bags of nails and spikes, a
great screw-jack, a dozen or two of hatchets, and,
above all, that most useful thing called a grind-
stone; all these I secured together with several
things belonging to the gnnner, particularly two
or three iron crow-bars, and two barrels of musket-
bullets, seven muskets, and another fowling-piece,
with some small shot, and a great roll of sheet-
lead; but this last was so heavy that I could not
hoist it up to get it over the ship's side.
Besides these things, I took all the men's clothes
I could find, and a spare fore-topsail, hammock,
and some bedding; and with this I loaded my
second raft, and brought them also safe on shore, to
my very great comfort.
Having got my second cargo on shore, (though
I was fain to open the barrels of powder, and
bring them by parcels, for they were too heavy,
being large casks,) I went to work to make a little
tent with the sail and some poles which I cut for
that purpose, and into this tent I brought every-
thing that would spoil either with rain or sun; and
I piled all the empty chests and casks up in a
circle round the tent, to fortify it from any sudden
attack, either from man or beast.
When I had done this, I blocked up the door of
the tent with some boards within, and an empty
chest set upon an end without, and spreading one
of the beds upon the ground, laying my two pistols
just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I
went to bed, for the first time, and slept very
quietly all night, being very weary and heavy; for
the night before I had slept little, and had worked
very hard all day, as well to fetch those things
from the ship as to get them on shore.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever was laid up, I believe for one man; but I was
not satisfied still, for while the ship sat upright in
that posture, I thought I ought to get every thing
out of her I could; so every day at low water, I
went on board, and brought away something or
other. But particularly the third time I went, I
brought away as much of the rigging as I could,
as also the small ropes and rope twine I could get,
with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend
the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gun-
powder. In a word, I brought away all the sails,
first and Jast, only I was fain to cut them in pieces,
and bring as much at a time as I could: for they
were no more useful to me for sails, but as mere
canvas only.
But that which comforted me still more, waa
that at last of all, after I had made five or six such
voyages as these, and though I had nothing more to
expect from the ship that was worth meddling
with, I say after all this, I found a great hogshead
of bread, three large runlets of rum or spirits, a
box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour: this was
surprising to me, because I had given over expect-
ing any more provisions, except what was spoiled
by water. I soon emptied the hogshead of the
bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in
pieces of the sails, which I cut out; and in a word
I got all this safe on shore also, though at several
times.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myself either against the savages, if any
should appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the
island; and I had many thoughts of the method
how to do this, and what kind of a dwelling to
make: whether I should make a cave in the earth,
or a tent upon the earth; and in short I resolved
upon both; the manner and description of which it
may not be improper to give an account of.
I consulted several things in my situation, which
I fonnd would be most proper for me; first, health
and fresh water, as I just now mentioned; second-
ly, shelter from the heat of the sun; thirdly, secu-
rity from ravenous creatures, whether man or beast;
fourthly, a view of the sea; that if God sent any
ship in sight I might not lose any advantage for
my deliverance, for which I was not willing to
banish all my expectations yet.
In search of a place proper for this, I found a
little plain on the side of a rising hill, whose front
was as steep as the side of a house, so that nothing
could come down upon me from the top. On the
side of this rock, there was a hollow place, worn a
little way in, like the entrance or door of a cave,
but there was not really any cave or door into the
rock at all.
On the flat of the green, just before this hollow
place, I resolved to pitch my tent. This plain was
not above a hundred yards broad, and about twice
as long, and lay like a green before my door, and
at the end of it, it descended irregularly every way
into the low grounds by the sea-side. It was on
the N. N. W. side of the hill, so that it was shel-
tered from the heat every day, till it came-to at
W. and by S. sun, or thereabouts, which in those
countries is near the setting.
Before I set up my tent, I drew a half-circle be-
fore the hollow place, which took in about ten
yards in its semi-diameter, from the rock, and
twenty yards in diameter, from its beginning and
ending.
In this half-circle I pitched two strong rows of
stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of
the ground above five feet and a half, and sharpened
on the top; the two rows did not stand above six
inches from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut
in the ship, and and laid them in rows upon one
another within the circle, between these two rows
of stakes np to the top, placing other stakes in the
inside, leaning against them, about two feet and a
half high, like a spur to a post; and this fence was
so strong, that neither man nor beast could get
into it, or over it. This cost me a great deal of
time and labour, especially to cut the piles in the
woods, and bring them to the place, and drive them
into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be, not
by a door, but by a short ladder over the top;
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after
tne; and so I was completely fenced in, and fortified,
as 1 thought, from all the world, and consequently
slept secure in the uighi, which otherwise I could
not have done: thoughts it appeared afterwards,
there was no necessity for all this caution from the
enemies I apprehended danger from.
Into this fence, or fortress, with infinite labour, I
carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammuni-
tion, and stores, of which you have an account
above; and I made a large tent also, which, to
preserve me from the rains, that in one part of the
year are very violent there, I made double, viz., one
smaller tent within, and one larger tent above it;
and covered the uppermost with a large tarpaulin,
which I had saved among the sails.
It cost me much labour, and many days, before
all these things were brought to perfection. It
happened soon after I had set up my tent, and
made the cave, that a thunder-storm came on sud-
denly. My very heart sunk within me, when I
thought that at one blast my powder might be
destroyed; on which, not my defence only, but
my subsistence, as I thought, entirely depended.—
I immediately applied myself to making it up into
small parcels, which I hid in holes among the
rocks, and carefully marked where I laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I
went out at least once every day with my gun, as
well to divert myself, as to see if I could kill any-
thing fit for food, and, as near as I could, to ac-
quaint myself with what the island produced. The
first time I went out, I presently discovered, that,
there were goats in the island, which was a great
satisfaction to me: but then it was attended with
this great mortification to me, viz., that they were so
ehy, so subtle, and so swift of foot, that it was the
difficultest thing in the world to come at them;
but I was not discouraged at this, not doubting but
I might now and then shoot one, as it soon after
happened; for after I had found their haunts a
little, I laid wait in this manner for them:—I ob-
served, if they saw me in the valleys, though they
were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a
terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the val-
leys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no notice
of me; from whence I concluded, that by the posi-
tion of their optics, their sight was so directed
downward, that they did not really see objects
that were above them. So afterwards I took this
method :—I always climbed the rocks first to get
above them, and then had frequently a fair mark.
The first shot I made among these creatures, I
killed a she-goat which had a little kid by her,
which she gave suck to, which grieved me heartily:
but when the old one fell, the kid stood stock still
by her till I came and took her up; and not only
BO, but when I carried the old one with me upon
my shoulder, the kid followed me quite to my en-
closure; upon which I laid down the dam, and
took the kid in my arms, and carried it over my
pale, in hopes to have bred it up tame; but it
would not eat; so I was forced to kill it and eat
it myself. These two supplied me with flesh a
great while; for I ate sparingly, and saved my
provisions (my bread especially) as much as pos-
sibly I could.
And now, being to enter into a melancholy rela-
tion of a scene of silent life, such, perhaps, as was
never heard of in the world before, I shall take it
from the beginning, and continue in its order. It
was, by my account, the 30th of September, when
in the manner as the above said, I first set foot upon
this horrid island, when the sun being, to ns, in its
autumnal equinox, was almost just over my head;
for I reckoned myself, by observation, to be in the
latitude of 9 degrees 22 minutes North of the Line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days,
it came into my thoughts, that I should lose my
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
ink, and should even forget the Sabbath days from
the working days; but to prevent this, I cut it
with my knife upon a large post, in capital letters;
and, making it into a great cross, I set it up on the
shore where I first landed; viz., I came on shore
here on the 30th of September, 1659. Upon the
sides of this square post, I cut every day a notch
with my knife, and every seventh notch was as
long again as the rest, and every first day of the
month as long again as that long one; and thus I
kept my calendar, or weekly, monthly, and yearly
reckoning of time.
In the next place we were to observe, that
among the many things which I brought off the
ship in the several voyages, which as above-men-
tioned, I made to it, I got several things of less
value, but not all less useful to me, which I omit-
ted setting down before; as in particular, pens,
ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain's,
mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three or
four compasses, some mathematical instruments,
dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation,
all of which I huddled together, whether I might
want them or no; also I found three very good
Bibles, which came to me in my cargo from Eng-
land, and which I had packed up among my things;
some Portuguese books, all which I carefully se-
cured. And I must not forget that we had in the
ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent history
I may have occasion to say something in its place;
for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the
dog, he jumped out of the ship himself, and
on shore to me, the day I went on shore with my
first cargo, and he was a trusty servant to me many
years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me,
nor any company that he could make up to me ; I
only wanted to have him to talk to me, but that he
could not do.
I found that I wanted a great many things, not-
withstanding all that I had amassed together;
and of these, that of ink was one, as also a spade,
pick-axe, and shovel, to dig or remove the earth;
needles, pins, and thread; as for linen, I soon
learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale, or surrounded my
habitation; the piles, or stakes, which were as
heavy as I could well lift, were a long time in
cutting and preparing in the woods, and more by
far in bringing them home; so that 1 sometimes
spent two days in cutting and bringing home one
of these posts, and a third day in driving it into
the ground; for which purpose I got a heavy piece
of wood at first, but at last bethought myself of
one of the iron crows, which, however, though I
found it, yet made driving them very laborious
work.
I now began to consider seriously upon my con-
dition,and drew up the state of my affairs in writ-
ing, and began to comfort myself as well as I
could, and to set the good against the evil; and I
stated impartially, like debtor and creditor, the
comfort I enjoyed against the miseries I suffered,
thus:— ,
EVIL. GOOD.
I am cast upon a But I am alive, and
59
horrible desolate island,
void of all hope of re-
covery.
I am singled out, and
separated, as it were,
from all the world to be
miserable.
I am divided from
mankind, a solitary one
banished from human
society.
I have no clothes to
cover me.
I am without any de-
fence or means to resist
any violence of men or
beast.
I have had no sonl to
speak to or to relieve
me.
not drowned, as all my
ship's company was.
But I was singled out
too, from all the ship's
crew, to be spared from
death; and He that mi-
raculously saved me from
death, can deliver me
from this condition.
But I am not starved,
and perishing on a bar-
ren place, affording no
sustenance.
But I am in a hot
climate, where, if I had
clothes, I could hardly
wear them.
But I am cast upon an
island where I see no
wild beasts to hurt me,
as I saw on the coast of
Africa; and what if I
had been shipwrecked
there.
But God wonderfully
sent the ship in near to
the shore, that I have
gotten out so many
things as will either sup-
ply my wants, or enable
me to supply myself even
as long as I live.
Upon the whole, there was an undoubted testi-
mony, that there was scarce any condition in the
world so miserable, but there was something ne-
yalive, or something positive to be thankful for in
it; and let this stand as a direction from the ex-
perience of the most miserable of all conditions in
this world, that we may always find in it some-
thing to comfort ourselves from, and to set, in the
description of good and evil, on the credit-side of
the accompt.
Having now brought my mind a little to relish
my condition, and given over looking out to sea,
to see if I could spy a ship; I say, giving over these
things, I began to apply myself to accommodate
my way of living, and to make things as easy to
me as I could.
I have already described my habitation, which
was a tent under the side of a rock, surrounded
with a strong pale of posts and cable, but I might
rather call it a wall; for I raised a kind of a wall
against it of turfs, about two feet thick on the out-
side; and, after some time (I think it was a year
and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the
rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of
trees; and such things as I could get to keep out
the rain, which I found at some times of the year
very violent.
1 set myself to enlarge my cave, and worked far-
ther into the earth: for it was a loose sandy rock,
which yielded easily to the labour I bestowed on
it; and so, when I found I was pretty safe as to
beasts of prey, I worked sideways to the right hand
into the rock; and then turning to the right again,
worked quite out, and made myself a door to come
out on the outside of my pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egress and regress, as it
was a back way to my tent, and to my storehouse,
but gave me room to stow my goods.
And now I began to apply myself to make such
necessary things as I found I most wanted, parti-
cularly a chair and a table; for without these I
was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the
world; I could not write or eat, or several thing?,
with so much pleasure without a table.
So I went to work; and here I must needs ob-
serve, that as reason is the substance and origin of
the mathematics, so by starting and squaring every-
thing by reason, and by making the most rational
judgment of things, every man may be, in time,
master of every mechanical art. I had never han-
dled a tool in my life, and yet, in time, by labour,
application, and contrivance, I found at last, that
I wanted nothing but I could have made it, espe-
cially if I had tools; however, I made abundance
of things, even without tools, and some with no
more tools than an adze and a hatchet, which, per-
haps, were never made that way before, and that
with infinite labour.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I
observed above, in the first place, and this I did out
of the short pieces of boards that I brought on my
raft from the ship; but when I had wrought on
some boards, as above, I made large shelves of
the breadth of a foot and a half, over one another,
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools,
nails, and iron work, and, in a word, to separate
everything at large in their places, that I might
easily come at them: also, I knocked pegs into the
rock to hang my guns on, and all things that would
hang up.
So that, had my cave been to be seen, it looked
like a general magazine of ail necessary things;
and I had everything so ready at my hand, that it
was great pleasure to me to see all my goods in
such order, and especially to find my stock of all
necessaries so great.
I now began to keep my journal, of which I shall
D
here give you the copy (though in it will be told
many particulars over again) as long as it lasted;
for at last, having no more ink, I was forced to
leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
SEPTEMBER 30, 1659. I, poor miserable Robinson
Crusoe, being shipwrecked during a dreadful storm
in the offing, came on shore on this dismal unfortu-
nate island, which I called the Island of Despair,
all the rest of the ship's company being drowned,
and myself almost dead.
All the rest of the day I spent in afflicting my-
self at the dismal circumstances I was brought to,
viz., I had neither food, house, clothes, weapon,
or place to fly to; and in despair of any relief, saw
nothing but death before me, either that I should
be devoured by wild beasts, murdered by savages,
or starved to death for want of food. At the ap-
proach of night, I slept in a tree, for fear of wild
creatures; but slept soundly, though it rained all
night.
October 1. In the morning I saw, to my great
surprise, the ship had floated with the high tide,
and was driven on shore again much nearer the
island, which, as it was some comfort on one hand,
(for seeing her sit upright, and not broken in pieces
I hoped, if the wind abated, I might get on board,
and get some food and necessaries out of her for
my relief,) so, on the other hand, it renewed my
grief at the loss of my comrades, who, I imagined,
if we had all stayed on board, might have saved
the ship, or at least that they would not have been
all drowned, as they were; and that, had the men
been saved, we might perhaps have built us a boat
out of the ruins of the ship, to hare carried us to
Hume other part of the world. I spent great part
of this day in perplexing myself on these things,
but at length seeing the ship almost dry, I went
upon the sand as near as I could, and then swam
on board. This day also continued raining, though
with no wind at all.
From the 1st of October to the 24th. All these
days entirely spent in making several voyages to
get all I could out of the ship, which I brought on
shore every tide of flood upon rafts. Much rain
also in these days, though with some intervals of
fair weather; but it seems, this was the rainy
season,
October 24. I overset my raft, and all the goods
I had got upon it, bnt being shoal water, and the
things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of
them when the tide was out.
October 25. It rained all night and all day, with
some gusts of wind, during which time the ship
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be seen, except
the wreck of her, and that Only at low water. I
spent this day in covering and securing the goods
I had saved, that the rain might not spoil them.
October 26. I walked about the shore almost all
day to find a place to fix my habitation, greatly
concerned to secure myself from any attack in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a semicircle for my encampment which
I resolved to strengthen with a work, wall, or for-
tification, made of double piles, lined within with
cable, and without with turf.
From this time till the end of the year, I employ-
ed myself in manufacturing furniture and other
necessaries. The latter part of the year the
weather was very bad and I was almost constantly
employed within doors.
January 1. Very hot still; but I went abroad
early and late, with my gun, and lay still in the
middle of the day. This evening, going farther
into the valleys, which, lay to the centre of the
island, I found there plenty of goats, though ex-
ceedingly shy, and hard to come at-; however, I
resolved to try if I could not bring my dog to hunt
them down.
January 2. Accordingly, the next day I went
out with my dog, and set him upon the goats ; but
I was mistaken, for they all faced about upon the
dog, and he knew his danger too well, for he
would not come near them.
January 3. I began my fence or wall, which,
being still jealous of my being attacked by some
body, I resolved to make very thick and strong.
[N. B.—This wall being described before, I pur-
posely omit what was said in the journal; it is
sufficient to observe, that I was no less time than
from the 3rd of January to the 4th of April, work-
ing, finishing and perfecting this wall, though it
was no more than about twenty-four yards in
length, being a half circle, from one place in the
rock, to another place about eight yards from it,
the door in the cave being from behind it.]
All this time I worked hard, the rains hinder-
ing me many days, nay, sometimes weeks together;
but I thought I should never be perfectly secure
till this wall was finished; and it is scarce cre-
dible with what inexpressible labour every thing
was done, but especially the bringing of piles out
of the woods, and driving them into the ground;
for I made them much greater than I needed to
have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside
double fenced, with a turf wall raised up close to
it, I persuaded myself that if any people were to
come on shore there, they would not perceive any
thing like a habitation; and it was very well I
did so, as may be observed• Tiereafter upon a very
remarkable occasion.
During this time, Ijnade my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain permitted me,
and made frequent discoveries in these walks of
something er other to my advantage: particularly
I found a kind of wild pigeon, which built Hot as
wood pigeons in a tree, but rather as house pigeons,
in the rocks; and taking some young ones, I en-
deavoured to breed them up tame, and did so; but
when they grew up, they all flew away; however,
I frequently found their nests, and got their young
ones, which were very good meat.
And now, in the managing my household affairs,
1 found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at first was impossible for me to make, as
indeed as to some of them it was; for instance, I
could never make a cask to be hooped. I had a
small runlet or two, as I observed before, but I
could not arrive at the capacity of making one by
them, though I spent many weeks about it; I
could neither put in the heads, or join the staves so
true to one another, as to make them hold water;
so I also gave that over.
In the next place, I was at a great loss for can-
dles, so that as soon as it was dark, which was
generally by seven o'clock, I was obliged to go to
bed. I remembered the lump of beeswax, with
which I made candles in my African adventure;
but 1 had none of that now; the only remedy I
had, was, that when I had killed a goat, I saved
the tallow, and with a little dish made of clay,
which I baked in the sun, to which I added a wick
P 2
of oakum, I made me a lamp; and this gave me a
light, though not a clear steady light like a candle.
In the middle of all my labours it happened, that,
rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which,
as I hinted before, had been filled with corn, for
the feeding of poultry, not for this voyage, but be-
fore, as I suppose, when the ship came from Lisbon;
what little remainder of corn had been in the bag
was devoured by rats, and I saw nothing in the
bag but husks and dust; and being willing to have
the bag for some other use, (I think it was to put
powder in, when I divided it for fear of the light-
ning, or some such use), I shook the husks of corn
out of it, on one side of my fortification, under the
rock.
It was a little before the great rains, just now
mentioned, that I threw this stuff away, taking no
notice of anything, and not so much as remember-
ing that I had thrown anything there; when,
about a month after, or thereabouts, I saw some
few stalks of something shooting out of the ground,
which I fancied might be some plant I had not
seen; but I was surprised, and perfectly astonished,
when a little time after I saw ten or twelve ears
come out, which were perfect green barley, of the
same kind as our European, nay, as our English
barley.
It is impossible to express the astonishment and
confusion of my thoughts on this occasion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed, I had very few notions of religion in my
head, nor had entertained any sense of anything
that had befallen me, otherwise than as a chance,
or, as we lightly say, what pleases God; without
so much as inquiring into the end of Providence in
these things, or His order in governing events in
the world; but after I saw barley grow there, in
a climate which I knew was not proper for corn,
and especially as I knew not how it came there, it
startled me strangely, and I began to suggest, that
God had miraculously caused this grain to grow,
without any help of seed sown, and that it was so
directed purely for my sustenance in that wild
place.
I carefully saved the ears of this corn, you may
be sure, in their season, which was about the end
of June; and laying up every corn, I resolved to
sow them all again, hoping in time to have some
quantity sufficient to supply me with bread; but it
was not till the fourth year that I would allow
myself the least grain of this sort to eat, and even
then but sparingly, as I shall say afterwards in its
order; for I lost all that I sowed in the first season,
by not observing the proper time; for I sowed just
before the dry season, so that it never came up at
all, at least not as it would have done.
Besides this barley, there was, as above, twenty
or thirty stalks of rice, which I preserved with the
same care, and whose use was of the same kind, or
to the same purpose: viz., to make bread, or rather
food; for I found ways to cook it without baking,
though I did that also after some time. But to
return to my journal.
I worked excessively hard these three or four
months to get my wall done; and on the 14th of
April I closed it up, contriving to go into it, not
by a door, but over the wall, by a ladder, that
there might be no sign on the outside of my habi-
tation.
April 16. I finished the ladder; so I went up
with the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up
after me, and let it down on the inside. This was
a complete enclosure to me; for within I had room
enough, and nothing could come at me from without,
unless it could first mount my wall.
The very next day after the wall was finished, I
had almost had my labour overthrown at once, and
myself killed. The case was thus: as I was busy,
in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the en-
trance of my cave, I was terribly frightened with
a most dreadful surprising thing indeed; for all on
a sudden, I found the earth come tumbling down
from the roof of my cave, and from the edge of
the hill, over my head, and two of the posts I had
set up in my cave, cracked in a frightful manner.
I was heartily scared, but thought nothing of what
was really the cause; only thinking that the top
of the cave was falling in, as some of it had done
before, and, for fear I should be buried in it, I ran
forward to my ladder; and not thinking myself
safe there neither, I got over the wall, for fear of
the pieces of the hill, which I expected might roll
down upon me. I was no sooner stept down upon
the firm ground, but I plainly saw it was a terrible
earthquake; for the ground I stood on shook three
times, at about two minutes' distance, with three
such shocks as would have overturned the strongest
building that could be supposed to have stood
upon the earth; and a great piece of the top of a
rock, which stood half a mile from me, next the
sea, fell down with such a horrible noise, as I never
heard in all my life. I perceived also the very sea
was put in motion by it; and, I believe that the
shocks were greater under the water than on the
island.
I was so amazed with the thing itself, having
never felt the like, or discoursed with one that had,
that I was like one dead or stupified; and the mo-
tion of the earth made my stomach sick, like one
a t was tossed at sea; but the noise of the falling
of the rock awakened me, as it were, and rousing
me from the stupified condition I was in, filled me
with horror, and I thought of nothing then bat the
hill falling upon my tent, and all my household
goods, and burying all at once; and this sunk my
very soul within me a second time.
After the third shock was over, and I felt no
more for some time, I began to take courage; and
yet I had not heart enough to get over my wall
again, for fear of being buried alive; but still sat
upon the ground, greatly cast down, and disconso-
late, not knowing what to do. All this while 1
had not the least serious religious thought, nothing
but the common " Lord have mercy upon me !" and
when it was over, that went away too.
While I sat thus, I found the sky overcast, and it
grew closdy, as if it would rain; and, in less
than half an hour, it blew a most dreadful hurri-
cane of wind. The sea was all on a sudden
covered with foam and froth, the shore was covered
with the breach of the water, the trees were torn
up by the roots, and a terrible storm it was; and
this held about three hours, and then began to
abate; and then, in two hours more it was calm,
and began to rain very bard.
All this while I sat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected; when, on a sudden, it came
into my thoughts, that the wind and rain being the
consequence of the earthquake, the earthquake it-
self was spent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again. With this thought my spirits be-
gan to revive, and the rain helping also to persuade
me, I went in, and sat me down in my tent; but
the rain was so violent, that my tent was ready to
be beaten down with it, and I was forced to go
into my cave, though very much afraid and uneasy,
for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz.,
to cat a hole through my new fortification, like a
sink, to let the water go out, which else would
have drowned my cave. After I had been in my
cave some time, and found no more shocks of the
earthquake follow, I began to be more composed;
and now, to support my spirits, which, indeed,
wanted it very much, I went to my little store,
and took a small drop of rum which, however, I
did then, and always very sparingly, knowing I
could have no more when that was gone.
It continued raining all that night, and great
part of next day, so that I could not stir abroad;
and, my heart being more composed, I began to
think of what I had best do; concluding that if the
island was subject to these earthquakes, there
would be no living for me in a cave, but I mast
consider of building me some little hut, in an open
place, which I might surround with a wall, as I
had done here, and so make myself secure from
wild beasts or men; but I concluded, if I staid
where I was, I should certainly, one time or other,
be buried alive.
With these thoughts, I resolved to move my
tent from the place where it stood, which was just
under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which,
if it should be shaken again would certainly fall
upon my tent. And I spent the two next days,
being the 19th and 20th of April in contriving
where and how to remove my habitation.
The fear of being swallowed up alive, made me
that I never slept in quiet; and yet the apprehen-
sion of lying abroad, without any fence was al-
most as bad; but still, when I looked about, and
saw how everything was put in order, how plea-
santly concealed I was, and how safe from danger,
it made me very loath to remove.
In the meantime it occurred to me, that it
would require a vast deal of time for me to do
this, and that I must be contented to run the ven-
ture where I was, till I had formed a camp for
myself, and had secured it, so as to remove to it.
So, with this resolution, I composed myself for a
time, and resolved that I would go to work, with
all speed, to build me a wall, with piles and cables,
&c., in a circle, as before, and set my tent up in it,
when it was finished; but that I would stay where
I waa, till it was finished, and fit to remove to.
April 28i 29. These two whole days I took up
in grinding my tools; my machine for turning my
grindstone performing very well.
April 30. Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, I now took a survey of it, and
reduced myself to one biscuit a day, which made
my heart very heavy.
May 1. In the morning, looking towards the sea-
side, the tide being low, I saw something lie on
the shore, bigger than ordinary, and it looked like
a cask; when I came to it, I found a small barrel
and two or three pieces of the wreck of the ship,
which were driven on shore by the late hurricane;
and, looking intently towards the wreck itself, I
thought it seemed to lie higher out of the water
than it used to do. I examined the barrel which
was driven on shore and soon found it was a barrel
of guupowder, but it had taken water, and the
powder was caked as hard as a stone; however, I
rolled it farther on shore for the present, and went
on upon the sands, as near as I could to the wreck
of the ship to look for more.
When I came down to the ship, I found it
strangely removed; the forecastle, which lay be-
foie buried in the sand, was heaved up at least six
feet; and tho stern, which was broken to pieces,
and parted from the rest by the force of the sea,
soon after I had left rummaging her, was tossed,
as it were up, and cast on one side; and the sand
was thrown so high on that side next the stern,
that whereas there was a great piece of water
before me, so that I could not come within a quar-
ter of a mile of the wreck without swimming. I
was surprised with this at first, but soon concluded
it must be done by the earthquake.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the de-
sign of removing my habitation; and I busied my-
self in searching whether I could make any way
into the ship; but I found nothing was to be ex-
pected of that kind, for that all the inside of the
ship was ehoked up with sand.
May 3. 1 began with my saw, and cnt a piece
of a beam through, which I thought held some of
the upper part, or quarter deck, together; and
when I had cut it through, I cleared away the
sand as well as I could, from the side which lay
highest; but the tide coming in, I was obliged to
give over for that time.
May 5 to 14. Went every day to the wreck, and
got a good deal of pieces of timber, and boards or
planks, and likewise two or three hundred weight
of iron.
May 15. It had blowed hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of
the water; but I stayed so long in the woods, to
get pigeOns for food, that the tide prevented me
going to the wreck that day.
May 24. Every day, to this day I worked on the
wreck, and, with hard labour I loosened some
things so much with the crow, that, the first flow-
ing tide, several casks floated out, and two of the
seamen's chests: but the wind blowing from the
shore, nothing came to land that day, bnt pieces of
timber, and a hogshead which had some Brazil pork
in it; but the salt water and the sand bad unfitted
it for use.
I continued the work every day to the 15th of
June, and by this time, I had got timber and
plank, and iron work enough to have built a good
boat, if I had known how; and also I got at several
times, and in several pieces, near one hundred
weight of the sheet lead.
June 16. Going down to the seaside, I found a
large tortoise or turtle; this was the first I had
seen, which, it seems, was only my misfortune,
not any defect of the place or scarcity; for, had I
happened to be on the other side of the island, I
might have had hundreds of them every day, as I
found afterwards; but perhaps, had paid enough
for them.
June 18. Rained all the day, and I staid within.
1 thought this time, the rain felt cold, and I was
something chilly, which I knew was not usual in
that latitude-
June 19. Very ill, and shivering, as if the wea-
ther had been cold.
June 20. No rest at night, violent pains in my
head, and feverish.
June 22. A little better; but under dreadful ap-
prehensions of sickness.
June 23. Very bad again, cold and shivering,
and then a violent head ache.
June 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
seven hours, cold fit, and hot, with faint sweats
after it.
June 26. Better: and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myself very weak; how-
ever I killed a she-goat, and with much difficulty
got it home, and broiled some of it, and ate; I
would fain have stewed it, and made some broth,
but had no pot.
June 27 The ague again so violent, that I lay
in bed all day, and neither ate nor drank. I was
ready to perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not
strength to stand up, or to get myself any water
to drink; I prayed to God again, but was light-
headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant,
that I knew not what to say; only I lay, and
cried, "Lord, look upon me I Lord, pity me I Lord,
have mercy upon me?" I suppose I did nothing
else, for two or three hours, till the fit wearing off,
I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night.
When I awaked, I found myself much refreshed,
but, weak and exceedingly thirsty; however, as I
had no water in my whole habitation, I was forced
to He till morning, and went to sleep again.
June 28. Being somewhat refreshed with the
sleep I had had, and the fit entirely off, I got up;
and though the fright and terror of my dream was
very great, yet I considered that the fit of ague
would return again the next day: and now was
my time to get something to refresh and support
myself when I should be ill; and the first thing I
did, I filled a large spare case bottle with water,
and set it upon my table, in reach of my bed, and
to take off the chill and aguish disposition of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into
it, and mixed them together; then 1 got me a piece
of goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but could
eat very little; I walked about, but was very weak,
and withal, very sad and heavy-hearted in the
sense of my miserable condition, dreading the re-
turn of my distemper the next day; at night I
made my supper of three of the turtle's eggs, which
I roasted in the ashes, and eat, as we call it, in
the shell: and this was the fitst bit of meat I had
ever asked God's blessing on, even, as I could
remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten, I tried to walk; but found
myself so weak, that I could hardly carry the gun
(for I never went out without that); so I went
but a little way, and sat down upon the ground,
looking out upon the sea, which was just before
me, and very calm and smooth.
After a while I rose up, pensive and sad, walked
back to my retreat, and went up over my wall as
if I had been going to bed; but had no inclination
to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted
my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the
apprehension of the return of my distemper terrified
me very much, it occurred to me that the Brazilians
took no physic but their tobacco, for almost all
distempers; and I had a piece of a roll of tobacco
in one of my chests which was quite cured, and
some also that was green, and not quite cured.
What use to make of it I knew not, as to my
distemper, or whether it was good for me or no;
but I tried several experiments with it, as if I was
resolved it should heal one way or other. I first
took a piece of leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,
which indeed, at first, almost stupified my brain;
the tobacco being green and strong, and that I had
not been much used to it; then I took some, and
steeped it an hour or two in rum, and resolved to
take a dose of it when I lay down; and last, I
burnt some upon a pan of coals, and held my nose
close over the smoke of it, as long as I could bear
it, as well for the heat as the virtue of it, and I
held it almost to suffocation.
In the interval of this operation, T took up my
Bible and began to read; but my head was too
much disturbed with the tobacco to bear reading,
at least at that time; only, having opened the book
casually, the first words that occurred to me were
these, "Call on me in the day of trouble, and I
will deliver, and thou shalt glorify me."
These words were very apt to my case, and
made some impression upon my thoughts at the
time of reading them, though not so much as they
did afterward; for, on being delivered, the word
had no sound, as I may say, to me: the thing was
so remote, so impossible in my apprehension of
things, that I began to say, as the children of Israel
did, when they were promised flesh to eat, "Can
God spread a table in the wilderness?" So I began
to say, "Can God himself deliver me from this
place?" As it was not for many years that this
hope appeared, this prevailed very often upon my
thoughts. But, however, the words made a great
impression on me, and I mused upon them very
often. It now grew late, and the tobacco had, as
I said, dosed my head so much, that I inclined to
sleep; so I left my lamp burning in the cave, lest
I should want any thing in the night, and went to
bed; but before 1 lay down, I did what I never
had done in all my life, I kneeled down, and prayed
to God to fulfil the promise to me, that if I called
upon him in the day of trouble, he would deliver
me. After my broken and imperfect prayer was
finished, I drank the rum in which I had steeped
the tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the
tobacco, that indeed I could scarce get it down.
Immediately upon this I went to bed, and I found
presently it flew up into my head violently; but I
fell into a sound sleep, and awaked no more, till
by the son, it must necessarily be near three o'clock
in the afternoon, the next day; nay, to this hour,
I am partly of the opinion that I slept all the next
day and night, and till almost three the day after;
for otherwise I know not how I should lose a day
out of my reckoning in the days of the week, as it
appeared some years after I had done; for if I had'
lost it by crossing and re-crossing the,Line, I should
have lost more than one day; but certainly. I lost a
day in my account, and I never knew which way.
Be that however, one way or other, when I
awoke I found myself exceedingly refreshed, and
my spirits lively and cheerful. When I got up I
was stronger than I was the day before, and my
stomach better; for I was hungry, and in short, I
had no fit the next day, but continued much altered
for the better. This was the 29th.
The 30th was my well day, of course, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
for. I killed a sea-fowl or two, something like a
brand goose, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them; so I eat some more of
the turtle's eggs, which were very good. This
evening I renewed the medicine, which I had sup-
posed did me good the day before, viz., the tobacco
steeped in rum; nor did I chew any of the leaf, or
hold my head over the smoke. However, I was not
so well the next day, which was the 1st of July,
as I hoped I should have been; for I bad a little
spice1 of the cold fit, but it was not much.
July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dosed myself with it, as at first, and
double the quantity which I drank.
July 3. I missed the fit for good and all, though
I did not recover my full strength for some weeks
after.
July*4. In the morning, I took the Bible; and,
beginning at the New Testament, I began seriously
to read it, and imposed upon myself to read a while
every morning and every night, not tying myself to
a number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
should engage me. It was not long after I set se-
riously to work, but I found my heart more deeply
and sincerely affected with the wickedness of my
past life. The impression of my dread revived, and
the words, " All these things have not brought thee
to repentance," ran seriously in my thoughts. I
was earnestly begging of God to give me repen-
tance, when it happened providentially, the very
day that I was reading the Scripture, I came to
these words, "He is exalted a Prince, and a Sa-
viour, to give repentance, and to give remission."
I threw down the book, and with my heart, as well
as my hands lifted up to Heaven, in a kind of ec-
stacy of joy, I cried out aloud, "Jesus, thou Son
of David; Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour,
give me repentance!"
My condition began now to be, though not less
miserable as to my way of living, yet much easier
to my mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a
constant reading of the Scriptures, and praying to
God, to things of a higher nature, I had a great
deal of comfort within, which till now I knew no-
thing of. Also, as my health and strength return-
ed, I bestirred myself to furnish myself with every
thing that I wanted, and to make my way of living
as regular as I could.
From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking abont with my gun in my
hand, a little and a little at a time, as a man that
was gathering up his strength after a fit of sick-
ness; for it is hardly to be imagined, how low I
was, and to what weakness I was reduced.
I had now been in this unhappy island above ten
months ; all possibility of deliverance from this con-
dition seemed to be entirely taken away from me;
and I firmly believe that no human being had ever
set foot on that place. Having now secured my
habitation, as I thought, to my mind, I had a great

ROBINSON CRUSOE ON HIS RAFT.
desire to make a more perfect discovery of the
island, and to see what other productions I could
find, which as yet I knew nothing of.
It was on the 15th of July that I began to take a
more particular survey of the island itself. I
went up the creek first, where, as I hinted, I had
brought my rafts on shore. I found, after I came
about two miles up, that the tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a* little brook
of running water, and very fresh and good: but
this being the dry season, there was hardly any
water in some parts of it; at least, not enough to
run in any stream so as it could be perceived.
The next day, the 16th, 1 went up the same way
again; and, after going something further than I
had gone the day before, I found the brook and the
savannas began to cease, and the country became
more woody than before. In this part I found dif-
ferent fruits, and particularly I found melons on
the ground, in great abundance, and grapes upon
the trees: and the clusters of grapes which were
now in their prime, were very rich and ripe. This
was a surprising discovery, and I was exceeding
glad of them ; but I was warned by experience to
eat sparingly of them, remembering, that when I
was ashore in Barbary, the eating of grapes killed
several of our Englishmen, who were slaves there,
by throwing them into fluxes and fevers; but I
found an excellent use for these grapes ; and that
was to cure and dry them in the sun, and keep
them as dried grapes or raisins.
In the night I took my first contrivance and got
np into a tree, where I slept well, and the .next
morning proceeded upon my discovery, travelling
nearly four miles, as I could judge by the length of
the valley, keeping still due north.
At the end of this march I came to an opening
k 2
where the country seemed to descend to the west;
and a little spring of fresh water, which issued out
of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way,
that is due east; and the country appeared so
fresh, so green, so flourishing, everything being io
a constant verdure or flourish of spring, that it
looked like a planted garden.
I saw here abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon,
and citron trees, but all wild, and few bearing any
fruit; at least, not then. However, the green
limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to
eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice
afterwards with water, which made it very whole-
some, and very cool and refreshing.
1 therefore resolved to lay up a store, as well of
grapes as limes and melons, to furnish myself for
the wet season, which I knew was approaching.
In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes
in one place, and a lesser heap in another, and a
great parcel of limes and melons in another place;
and taking a few of each with me, I travelled
home afterwards and resolved to come again, and
bring a bag or sack, to carry the rest home.
Accordingly, having spent three days in this
journey, I came home; but before I got thither the
grapes were spoiled: the richness of the fruit, and
the weight of the juice, having broken and bruised
them so much that they were good for little or
nothing; as to the limes they were good, but I
could bring but a few.
The next day being the 19th, I went back,
having made me two small bags to bring home my
harvest; but I was surprised, when coming to my
heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when
I gathered them, I found them all spread abroad,
trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some
there, and abundance eaten and devoured. By
this I concluded there were wild creatures there-
abouts, which had done this; but what they were
I knew not.
The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had
hung up, were perfectly dried; and indeed, were
excellent raisins of the sun; so T began to take
them down from the trees, and was very happy
that I did so, for the rains which followed would
have spoiled them, and I had lost the best part of
my winter food; for I had above two hundred
large bunches of them. No sooner had I taken
them all down, and carried most of them home to
my cave, but it began to rain; and from hence,
which was the 14th of August, it rained more or
less every day, till the middle of October; and
sometimes so violently that I could not stir out of
my cave for several days.
In this season I was much surprised with the
increase of my family. I had been concerned for
the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me,
or, as I thought was dead; and I heard no more
tidings of her till, to my astonishment, she came
home about the end of August, with three kittens.
This was the more strange to me, because I thought
I had killed a wild-cat, as I called it, with my
gun; yet I thought it was quite a different kind
from our European cats; yet the young cats were
of the same kind of house breed, like the old one;
and both my cats being females, I thought it very
strange indeed. But from these three cats I came
afterwards to be-so pestered, that I was forced to
kill them like vermin, or wild beasts; and to drive
them from my house as much as possible.
From the 14th to the 20th of August, it rained
incessant, so that I could not stir, and was now
very careful not to be too much wet. In this con-
finement I began to be straitened for food; but
venturing out twice, I one day killed a goat; and
the last day, which was the 26th, I found a
very large tortoise, which was a treat to me; and
my food was regulated thus; I eat a bunch of rai-
sins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat's flesh,
or of the turtle, for my dinner, broiled, (for, to my
great misfortune, I had no vessel to boil or stew
anything in); and two or three of the turtle's eggs
for supper.
September 30. I was now come to the unhappy
anniversary of roy landing. I cast op the notches
on my post, and found I had been on shore three
hundred and sixty-five days. I kept this day as a
solemn fast, setting it apart to religious exercises,
prostrating myself on the ground with the most
serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, ac-
knowledging His righteous judgments upon me,
and praying Him to have mercy on me through
Jesus Christ.
1 had all (his time observed no Sabbath-day ; for
as I at first had no sense of religion upon my mind,
I had after some time omitted to distinguish the
weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for
the Sabbath-day, and so did not really know what
any of the days were; but now having cast up the
days as above, I found that I had been there a
year; so I divided it into weeks, and set apart
every seventh day for a Sabbath; though I found
at the end of my account, I had lost a day or two
in my reckoning.
A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and
so I contented myself to use it more sparingly, and
to write down only the most remarkable events of
my life, without continuing a daily memorandum of
other things.
The rainy season, and the dry season, began now
to appear regular to me; and I learned to divide
them so as to provide for them accordingly. But
I bonght all my experience before I had it; and
this I am going to relate was one of the most dis-
couraging experiments that I made. I have men-
tioned, that I had saved a few ears of barley and
rice, which I had surprisingly found spring up, as I
thought it a proper time to sow it after the rains,
the sun being in its southern position going from me.
Accordingly, I dug up a piece of ground, as well
as I could, with my wooden spade, and dividing it
into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was
sowing, it casually occurred to my thoughts, that
I would not sow it all at first, because I did not
know when was the proper time for it; so I sowed
about two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a hand-
ful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterward, that I
did so; for not one grain of that I sowed this time
came to anything; for the dry months following,
the earth having had no rain after the seed was
sown, it had no moisture to assist it in its growth,
and never came up at all, till the wet season had
come again, and then it grew as if it had been but
newly sown.
Finding my first seed did not grow, which T
easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for a
moister piece of ground to make another trial in;
and I dug up a piece of ground near my new bower,
and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a little
before the vernal equinox; and this, having the
rainy months of March and April to water it,
sprang up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good
crop; but having part of the seed left only, and not
daring to sow all that I had yet, I had but a small
quantity at last, my whole crop not amounting to
above half a peck of each kind.
But, by this experiment, I was made master of
86
ROBINSON CRUSOE.
my business, and knew exactly when the proper
season was to sow; and that I might expect two
seed times, and two harvests every year.
I found that the seasons of the year might gene-
rally be divided, not into summer and winter, as in
Europe; but in the rainy season and the dry season,
and were generally thus:—
Half February
March
Half April
Half April
May
June
July
Half August
Half August
September
Half October
Half October
November
December
January
Half February
Rainy; the sun being then on
or near the Equino"x.
Dry; the sun being then to
the north of the Line.
Rain; the sun being then come
back.
Dry; the sun being then to the
south of the Line.
The rainy season sometimes held longer or shorter,
as the winds happened to blow; and this was the
general observation I made.
In this time I found much employment (and very
suitable for the time;) for I found great occasion
of many things which I had no way to furnish my-
self with, but by hard labour, and constant ap-
plication; particularly I tried many ways to make
myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for
the purpose proved so brittle, that they would do
nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me
now, that, when I was a boy, I used to take great
delight in standing at a basket maker's in the town
where my lather lived, to see them make their
wicker ware; and being, as boys usually are, very
officious to help, and a great observer of the man-
ner how they worked these things, and sometimes
lending a hand, I had, by this means, so full a
knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted no-
thing but the materials; when it came into my,
mind, that the twigs of that tree, from whence I
cut my stakes, might possibly be as tough as the
willows and osiers, in England, and I resolved to
try them.
Accordingly, the next day, when I went to my
country house, as I called it, I cat some of the smaller
twigs, and found them to my purpose as much as I
could desire: whereupon I came the next time pre-
pared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which
I soon found, for there was great plenty of them.
These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge;
and when they were fit for use, I carried them to
my cave; and here, during the next season, I em-
ployed myself in making, as well as I could, a great
many baskets, both to carry earth, or to carry or
lay up anything as I had occasion; and though I
did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made
them sufficiently serviceable to my purpose; and
thus, afterwards, I took care never to be without
them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made
more; especially I made strong deep baskets to
place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should
come to have any quantity of it.
Having mastered the difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I bestirred myself to see, if
possible, how to supply two wants. I had no ves-
sels to hold anything that was liquid, except two
runlets which were almost full of rum, and some
glass bottles, some of the common size and others
which were case bottles, square, for the holding of
water, spirits, &c. I had not so much as a pot to
boil anything in, except a great kettle which I
saved out of the ship, and which was too big for,
the uses I desired it for, viz., to make broth, and
stew a bit of meat by itself. The next thing I
would fain have had was a tobacco pipe; but it
was impossible for me to make one; however, I
found a contrivance for that too at last.
I mentioned before that I had a great mind to
see the whole island, and that I travelled up the
brook, and so on where I had built my bower, and
where I bad an opening quite to the sea, on the
other side of the island. I now resolved to travel
quite across to the sea-shore on that side; and so
taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger
quantity ot powder and shot than usual, with two
biscuit cakes, and a great bunch of raisins in my
pouch, for my store, I began my journey. When I
had passed the vale where my bower stood, as
above, I came in view of the sea, to the west; and
it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land,
whether an island or a continent 1 could not tell;
but it lay very high, extending from the west, to
the W. S. W., at a great distance: by my guess, it
was fifteen or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this
might be, otherwise than I knew it must be part
of America: and, as I concluded by all my obser-
vations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and
perhaps was all inhabited by savages, where, if I
should have landed, I had been in a worse condi-
tion than I was now, and therefore I acquiesced
in the disposition of Providence, which I began to
own, and to believe, ordered everything for the
best.
Besides, I considered, that if this land was the
Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other,
see some vessels pass or repass one way or other;
but if not, then it was a savage coast between the
Spanish country and Brazils, the inhabitants of
which were the worst of savages, for they were
cannibals, or men-eaters, and devoured all the
human bodies that fell into their hands.
With these considerations I walked very leisurely
forward. I found that side of the island where I
now was, much pleasanter than mine, the open or
savanna fields sweet, adorned with flowers and
grass, and full of very fine wood. I saw abundance
of parrots, and fain would have caught oni, if pos-
sible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to
speak to me. I did, after some pains-taking, catch
a young parrot, for I knocked it down with a stick,
and I took it home; but it was some years before
I could make him speak to me. However, at last I
taught him to call me by my name very familiarly.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey. I
found, in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with; nor could I
satisfy myself to eat them, though I killed several.
But I had no need to be venturous, and I had no
want of food, and of that which was very good,
especially these three sorts, viz., goats, pigeons,
and turtle, or tortoise, which, added to my grapes,
Leadenhall market could not have furnished a table
any better than I could, in proportion to the com-
pany.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
in a day, or thereabouts; but I took so many turns
and returns, to see what discoveries I could make,
that I came weary enough to the place where I
resolved to sit down for the night; and then I
either reposed myself in a tree, or surrounded my-
self with a row of stakes set upright in the ground,
from one tree to another, so as no wild creature
could come at me without waking me.
As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was sur-
prised to see that I had taken up my lot on the
worst side of the island; for here, indeed, the
shore was covered with innumerable turtles,
whereas, on the other side, I had found but thres
in a year and a half. Here was also an infinite
number of fowls of many kinds, some of which I
had seen, and some of which I had not seen before,
and many of them very good to eat, but I knew
not their names, except those called penguins.
I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was
very sparing of my powder and shot, and therefore
had more mind to kill a she-goat, if I could, whioh
I could better feed on, And though there were
more goats here than on my side of the island, yet
it was with much difficulty that I could come near
them, the country being flat and even, and they saw
me much sooner than when I was on the hills.
I confess this side of the island was much plea-
santer than mine, yet I had not the least inclina-
tion to remove; and I seemed all the while I was
here, to be, as it were, upon a jpurney, and from
home. However, I travelled along- the shore of
the sea towards the east, I suppose, about twelve
miles; and then, setting up a great pole upon the
shore for a mark, I concluded to go home again;
and that the next journey I took should be on the
other side of the island, east from my dwelling,
and so round till I came to my post again.
I took another way to come back than that I
went, thinking that I could easily keep all the
island so much in view, that I could not miss find-
ing my first dwelling, by viewing the country: but
found myself mistaken; for being come about two
or three miles, I found myself in a very large val-
ley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills
covered with woods, that I could not see which
was my way by any direction but that of the sun;
nor even then, unless I knew very well the position
of the sun at that time of the day.
It happened, unfortunately, that the weather
proved hazy three or four days, while I was in this
valley; and not being able to see the sun, I wan-
dered about very uncomfortably, and at last was
obliged to find out the seaside, look for my post,
and come back the same way I went; and then by
easy journeys, I returned homewards, the weather
being exceedingly hot, and my gun, ammunition,
and hat, and other things, very heavy.
I cannot express what satisfaction it was to me
to come to my old abode, and lay down in my
hammock bed. This little wandering journey
without any settled habitation, had been unpleasant
to me, so that my own house, as I called it, was
a perfect settlement, compared to that; and it ren-
dered everything about me so very comfortable,
that I resolved I would never go a great way from
it again, while it should be my lot to stay on the
island.
I reposed myself here a week to rest and regale
myself after my long journey, during which, most
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be
a mere domestic, and to be very well acquainted
with me. Then I began to think of the kid which
I had pent up within my little circle, and resolved
to go and fetch it home, or give it some food; ac-
cordingly I went, and found it where I left it, for,
indeed, it could not get out, but was almost starved
for want of food. I went and cut boughs of trees,
and branches of such shrubs as 1 could find, and
threw them over, and having fed it, I tied it aa I
did before, to lead it away, but it was so tame
with being hungry, that I had no need to have it
tied, for it followed me like a dog; and became,
from that time, one of my domestics also, and
would never leave me afterwards.
The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was
now come, and I kept the 30th of September in the
same solemn manner as before, being the anniver-
sary of my landing on the island, having now been
there two years, and no more prospect of being
delivered than the first day I came there. I spent
the whole day in humble and thankful acknow-
ledgments of the many wonderful mercies which
my solitary condition was attended with, and
without which, it might have been infinitely more
miserable. I gave humble and hearty thanks that
God had been pleased to discover to me, even that
it was possible I might be more happy in this soli-
tary condition, than I should have been in all the
pleasures of the world; that He could fully make
up to me all the deficiencies of my solitary state,
and the want of human society by His presence,
and the communications of grace to my soul, sup-
porting, comforting, and encouraging me to depend
upon His providence here, and hope for His eternal
presence hereafter.
I was now in the months of November and De-
cember, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck, for I had lost
one whole crop by sowing in the dry season, but
now my crop promised very well, when on a sud-
den, I found I was in danger of losing it all again
by enemies of several sorts, which it was scarce
possible to keep from it. At first, the goats and
-wild creatures which I called hares, who, tasting
the sweetness of the blade, lay in it night and day
as soon as it came up, and eat so close, that it
could get no time to shoot up into stalk. This I
saw no remedy for, but by making an enclosure
about it with a hedge, which I did with a great
deal of toil, and the more as it required speed, the
creatures daily spoiled my corn. However, as my
arable land was but small, I got it tolerably well
fenced in, in about three weeks' time; and shoot-
ing some of the creatures in the day time, I set my
dog to guard it during the night, tying him up to
a stake at the gate, where he would stand and
bark all the night long; so, in a little time, the
enemies forsook the place, and the corn grew strong
and well, and began to ripen apace.
But as the beasts injured me before, while my
corn was in the blade, so the birds were likely to
injure me now, when it was in the ear; for, going
along by the place to see how it threve, I saw my
little crop surrounded with fowls, of I know not
how many kinds, who stood, as it were, watching
till I should be gone. I immediately let fly among
them; and I had no sooner fired, but there rose up
a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen, from
amongst the corn.
This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that, in
a few days, they would devour all my hopes; tuat
I should be starved, and never be able to raise a
crop at all; and what to do I could not tell. In
the first place, I went among it to see what damage
was already done, and found that they had spoiled
a good deal of it; but that, as it was too green for
them, the loss was not so very great, but that the
remainder was likely to be a good crop, if it could
be saved.
I staid by it to load my gun, and then coming
f
away, I could easily see the thieves sitting upon
the trees about me as if they only waited until I
was gone away; and the event proved it to be so;
for, as I walked off as if I was going, I was no
sooner out of their sight, but they dropped down,
one by one into the corn again. I was so much
provoked that I had not patience to stay till more
came, knowing that every grain that they eat now,
was, as it might be said, a peck loaf to me in con-
sequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again,
and killed three of them. This was what I wished
for; so I took them up, and served them as we
serve notorious thieves in England, viz., hung
them in chains as a terror to others. It is almost
impossible to imagine that tbis should have such
an effect as it had; for the birds would not only
not come at the corn, but, in short, they forsook
all that part of the island, and I could never see
a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows
hnng there.
This I was very glad of; and about the latter
end of December, which was my second harvest of
the year, I reaped my crop. I was sadly put to it
for a scythe or sickle, to cut it down with; and all
I could do was to make one as well as I could, out
of one of the broad-swords, or cutlasses, which I
saved among the arms out of the ship. However,
as my crop was but small, 1 had no great difficulty
to cut it down. In short, I reaped it in my way,
for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried it
away in a great basket I had made, and so rubbed
it out with my hands. At the end of all my har-
vesting, I found that out of my half-peck of seed, 1
had near two bushels of rice, and above two bushels
and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess,
for I had no measure.
However, this war- a- great encouragement to
me, and I foresaw that in time it would please
God to supply me with bread. And yet here [ was
perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind
or make meal of my corn, or, indeed how to clean
it, and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to
make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I
knew not how to bake it. These things being
added to my desire for having a good quantity of
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved
not to taste any of this crop, but to preserve it all
against the next season for seed ; and, in the mean-
time, to employ all my study and hours of working
to accomplish this great work of providing myself
with corn and bread.
It may be truly said, that I now worked for my
bread. It is wonderful what a strange multitude
of little things are necessary in the providing, pro-
ducing, dressing, and finishing this one article of
bread.
I that was reduced to a mere state of nature,
found this to be my daily discouragement, and was
made more and more sensible of it every hour, even
after I had got the first handful of seed corn,
which, as I have said, came up unexpectedly, and
to my surprise-
First, I had no plough to turn the earth, no spade
or shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by
making a wooden spade, as I observed before, but
this did my work but in a wooden manner; and
though it cost me a great many days to make it,
yet for want of iron it not only wore out sooner,
but it made my work the harder, and to be per-
formed much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the bad-
ness of the performance. When the corn was
sown I had no barrow, but was forced to go over
it myself, and drag a heavy bough of a tree over it,
to scratch the earth as it may be called, rather
than harrow it.
When it was growing and gro wn,I have observed
already how many things I wanted, to fence it,
secure it, mow or reap it, cure and carry it home,
thresh, part it from the chaff and save it. Then I
wanted a mill to grind it, sieves to dress it, yeast
and salt to make it into bread, and an oven to bake
it in; and yet these things I did without, as shall
be observed. Allthis, an I said, made every thing
laborious and tedious to me, but that there was no
help for; neither was my time so much loss to me,
because as I had divided it, a certain part of it was
every day appointed to these works; and, as I re-
solved to use none of the corn for bread, till I- had
a great quantity by me, I had the next six months
to apply myself, by labour and invention to furnish
myself with utensils proper for the performing all
the operations necessary for making bread, when I
had corn enough fit for my use.
But first, I had to prepare more land, for I had
now seed enough to sow above an acre of ground.
Before I did this, I had a week's work, at least, to
make me a spade, which, when it was done, was
but a sorry one indeed, and very heavy, and re-
quired double labour to work with it. However I
went through that, and sowed my seed in two
large pieces of ground, as near to my house as I
could find them to my mind, and fenced them in
with a good hedge, the stakes-of which were all cut
of that wood which I set before, which I knew
would grow; so that, in one year's time, I knew I
should have a quick or living hedge, that would
want but little repair. This work took me up
three months, but part of that time was of the wet
season, when I could not go abroad.
I had long studied, by some means or other to
make myself some earthen vessels, which indeed I
wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at
them. However, considering the heat of the cli-
mate, I did not doubt but, if I could only find any
such clay, I might botch up some pot, as might
being dried in the sun, be hard enough and strong
enough to bear handling, and to hold anything that
was dry, and required to be kept so; and as this
. was necessary in preparing corn, meal, &c, which
was the thing I was upon, I resolved to make some
as large as I could, to stand like jars to hold what
should be put in them.
It would make the reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many awkward ways I
took to raise this paste; what odd, mis-shapen,
ugly things I made ; how many of them fell in, and
how many of them fell out, the clay not being stiff
enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked
by the over violent heat of the sun, being set out
too hastily; and how many fell to pieces with only
removing, as well before as after they were dried:
and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to
find the clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring it
home, to work it, I could not make above two
large, earthen, ugly things, (I cannot call them
jars,) in about two months' labour.
I happened, some time after, to make a large fire
for cooking my meat; when I put it out, after I
had done with it, I found a broken piece of one of
my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard
as a stone, and as red as a tile. I was agreeably
surprised to see it, and said to myself they might
be made to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This set me to study how to work my fire, so as
to make it burn me some pots. I had no notion of
a kiln, such as potters burn in, or of glazing them
p
with lead, though I had some lead to do it with;
but I placed three large pipkins, and two or three
pots, in a pile, one upon another, and placed my
fire-wood around it, with a great heap of embers
under them. I plied the fire with fresh fuel round
the outside, and upon the top, till I saw the pots
in the inside red hot quite through, and let them
stand in that heat five or six hours, till I found one
of them, though it did not crack, did melt or run;
for, the sand, which was mixed with the clay,
melted with the violence of the heat, and would
have run into glass if I had gone on; so I slack-
ened my fire gradually, until the pots began to
abate of the red colour; and watching them all
night, that I might not let the fire abate too fast,
in the morning I had three very good, I will not
say handsome pipkins, and two other earthen pots,
as hard burnt as could be desired ; and one of them
perfectly glazed with the running of the sand.
After this experiment, I need not say that I
wanted no sort of earthenware for my use; but I
must needs say, as to the shupes of them, they
were very indifferent.
My next concern was to get me a stone mortar
to stamp or beat my corn in; for, as to a mill,
there was no thought of arriving to that perfection
of art, with one pair of hands. To supply this
want I was at a great loss; for, of all the trades
in the world, I was as perfectly unqualified for a
stone cutter, as for any other whatever; neither
had I any tools to do it with. I spent many a day
to find a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and
make fit for a mortar, but could find none, except
what was in the solid rock, and which I had no
way to dig or cut out, nor indeed were the rocks
of the island of hardness sufficient, but were of a
sandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear
the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the
corn without filling it with sand. So, after a
great loss of time in searching for a stone, I gave
it over, and resolved to look out a great block of
hard wood, which I found indeed much easier;
and petting one as big as I had strength to stir, I
rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my
axe and hatchet, and then, with the help of fire,
and infinite labour, made a hollow place in it, as
the Indians in Brazil make their canoes. After
this I made a great heavy pestle or beater, of the
wood called iron wood, and this I prepared and
laid by against I had my next crop of corn, when
I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound, my
corn into meal, to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a sieve to dress
my meal, and to part it from the bran and the
husks, without which I did not see it possible I
could have any bread. This was the most difficult
task; for I had nothing like the necessary things
to make it with, I mean fine thin canvas, or stuff
to sift meal through. And here I was at a full
stop for many months ; nor did I really know what
to do, linen I had none left, but what was mere
rags. I had goat's hair, but neither knew how to
weave or spin it; and had I known how, there
were no tools to work it with ; all the remedy that
I found for this was, that at last I did remember
I had among the seamen's clothes, which were
saved out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico
or muslin; and with some of the best pieces of
these I made three small sieves.
The baking part was the next thing to be
thought of, and how I should make bread when I
came to have corn; for, first, I had no yeast. As
to that part, as there was no supplying the want,
so I did not concern myself much about it; but
for an oven I was indeed in great pain. At length
I found an expedient for that also, which was
this:—I made some earthen vessels very broad, hut
not deep, that is to say, about two feet diameter,
and not above nine inches deep; these I burnt in
the fire, as I had done the others, and laid them by,
and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
fire upon my hearth, which I paved with some
square tiles, of my own making and burning also.
When the fire-wood was burnt very much into
embers, or live coals, I threw them forward upon
the hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there I
let them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then
sweeping away all the embers, I set down my loaf
or loaves, and, whelming down the earthen pot
upon them, drew the embers all round the outside
of the pot, to keep in and add to the heat; and
thus, as well as in the best oven in the world, I
baked my barley loaves, and became, in a little
time, a pastry cook into the bargain, having made
myself several cakes of the rice.
It need not be wondered at, if all these things
took up most of the third year of my abode here;
for it is to be observed, that in the interval of these
things, my new harvest and hushandry had to be
managed, for I reaped my corn in its season,
carried it home, and laid it up in the ear, in my
large baskets till an opportunity occurred to rub it
out; having no floor to thrash it on, or instrument
to thrash it with.
And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, it
became necessary to build my barns bigger. Being1
in want of a place to lay it up, for the increase of
corn now yielded me so much, that I had of bailey
about twenty bushels, and as much or more of rice;
insomuch that I now resolved to use it freely, for
my bread had been quite gone a great while; being
resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient
for me for a whole year, and to sow but once a
year.
Upon the whole, finding that the forty bushels of
barley and rice were much more than I could con-
sume in a year, so I resolved to sow just the same
quantity every year as the last.
During the time those things were doing, my
thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land,
which I had seen from the other side of the island,
and was not without secret wishes to get on shore;
fancying, that seeing the main land, and an in-
habited country, I might find some way or other
to convey myself farther, and at last might escape.
Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long
boat, with the shoulder of mutton sail, with which
we sailed abore a thousand miles on the coast of
Africa, but this was in vain. Then I went to look
at our ship's boat, which was blown up upon the
shore a great way in the storm, when we were first
cast away. It lay almost where it was at first,
but not quite, and was turned by the force of the
waves and the winds, almost bottom upwards,
against a high ridge of rough sand, but no water
about it as before.
Had I had hands to have refitted it, and to have
launched it again into the water, the boat would
have done well enough to have taken me back into
the Brazils; but I might easily have foreseen that
I could no more turn it, and set it upright upon its
bottom, than I could remove the island. How-
ever, 1 went to the woods and cut levers and rol-
lers, and brought them to the boat, resolved to try
what could be done, suggesting to myself, that if it
could be turned over, the damage it had received
might easily be repaired, and it would be a very
good boat, and I might go to sea in it very easily.
F 2
I spared no pains however in this piece of fruit-
less toil, and spent, I think, three or four weeks
about it; at last, finding it impossible to heave it
up with my little strength, I fell to digging away
the sand to undermine it, and so to make it fall
down, setting pieces of wood to trust and guide it
in the fall.
But when 1 had done this, I was unable to stir
it up again, or to get under it, much less to move
it forward towards the water, so I was forced to
give it over; and yet my desire to venture over for
the main increased, rather than decreased, as the
means for it seemed impossible. This at length set
me upon thinking whether it was not possible to
make myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the na-
tives of those climates make; even without tools,
or, as I might say, without hands, viz., of the trunk
of a great tree This I not only thought possible,
but easy; but not at all considering the inconveni-
ences which I lay under more than the Indians did,
(want of hands to move it into the water, when it
was made,) a difficulty much harder for me to sur-
mount than all the consequences of want of tools
could be to them; for what was it to me, that when
I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, I might
with great trouble cut it down, if after I should be
able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into
the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the
inside to make it hollow, so as to make a boat of
it; if after all this, I must leave it where I found
it, and was not able to launch it into the water?
One would have thought I could not have had
the least reflection upon my mind of my circum-
stances while I was making this boat, but I should
have immediately thought how I should get it into
the sea; but my thoughts were so intent upon my
voyage over the sea in it, that I never once thought
how I should get it off the land; and it was more
ea.sy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea
than forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set
it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the most like a
fool that ever man did who had any of his senses
awake. I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake
it; not but that the difficulty of launching my boat
came often into my head; but I put a stop to my
own enquiries into it by the foolish answer which
I gave myself—" Let me first make it, I'll warrant
I'll find some way or other to get it along when it
is done."
This was a most preposterous method; but the
eagerness of my fancy prevailed, and to work I
went and felled a cedar tree. I question much
whether Solomon ever had such a one for the build-
ing the temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten
inches diameter at the lower part next the stump,
and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of
twenty-two feet; after which it lessened for a
while, then parted into branches. It was not with-
out infinite labour that I felled this tree. I was
twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bot-
tom; I was fourteen more getting the branches
and limliH, and the vast spreading head of it cut off,
which I hacked and hewed through with my axe
and hatchet, with inexpressible labour. After this
it cost me a month to shape it, and dub it to a
proportion, and to something like the bottom of a
boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three months more to clear the in-
side, and work it out so as to make an exact boat
of it. This I did indeed without fire, by mere
mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour,
till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua,
and big enough to have carried aix and twenty
men, and consequently big enough for me and the
whole of my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The boat was really
bigger than ever I saw a canoe, or periagna, that
was made of one tree, in my life; and there re-
mained nothing but to get it into the water. But
all my devices to get it there failed, though they
cost me infinite labour.
This grieved me heartily: and I now saw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
judge rightly of our own strength to go through
with it.
I had now been here so long, that many things
which I had brought on shore for my help were
either quite gone, or very much wasted, and near
spent.
My ink, as I observed, had been quite gone for
some time, all but a very little, which I eked out
with water, till it was so pale, it scarce left any
appearance of black upon the paper.
The next thing to my ink being finished was that
of my bread ; I mean the biscuit which I had brought
out of the ship. This I had husbanded to the last
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a day
for above a year; and yet I was quite without
bread for near a year before I got any corn of my
own; and great reason I had to be thankful that I
bad any at all, the getting it being, as has already
been observed, next to miraculous.
My clothes, too, began to decay mightily. As
to linen, I had had none for a good while, except
some check shirts which I found in the chests of
the other seamen, and which I carefully preserved,
because many times I could bear no other clothes on
but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that I had, among all the men's clothes of the ship,
almost three dozen of shirts. There were also
several thick watch-coats of the seamen, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear;
and although the weather was so violently hot, that
there was no need of clothes, yet I could not go
quite naked, though I was quite alone.
One reason why I could not go quite naked was,
I could not bear the heat of the sun so well when
in that state, as with some clothes on, nay, the very
heat frequently blistered my skin: whereas, with a
shirt on, the airitself made some motion, and whist-
ling under the shirt was two-fold cooler than with-
out it.
Upon these views I began to consider about put-
ting the few rags I had, which I called clothes,
into some order. I had worn out all the waist-
coats I had; and my businpss was now to try if I
could not make jackets out of the great watch-
coats, and such other materials as I had by me:
so I set to work a tailoring, or rather a botching,
for I made piteous work of it. However, I made
shift to make two or three new waistcoats, which
I hoped would serve me a great while; for breeches
or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed,
afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all
the creatures that I killed, I mean the four-footed
ones, and hung them up stretched out with sticks
in the sun, by which means some of them were so
dry and hard, that these were fit for little, but
others were very useful. The first thing I made of
those was a great cap for my head, with the hair
on the outside to shoot off the rain; and this I per-
formed so well, that after this, I made me a suit of
clothes, wholly of those skins; that is to say, a
waistcoat and breeches, open at the knees, and both
,--
loose; for they were rather wanting to keep me
cool, than to keep me warm. I mast not omit to
acknowledge, they were wretchedly made: for if
I was a bad carpenter, I was a worse tailor.
After this I spent a great deal of time and pains
to make me an umbrella: I was, indeed, in great
want of one, and had a great mind to make one.
I had seen them made in the Brazils, where they
are very useful in the great heats which are there,
and I felt the heat as great here, and greater too,
being nearer the Equinox; besides, as I was
obliged to be much abroad, it was a most useful
thing to me, as well for the rains as the heats. I
was a great while before I could make anything
likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the
way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to
my mind; but at last I made one that answered
indifferently well. The main difficulty I found was
to make it let down, too, and draw in: it would
not be portable for me any way but just over my
head, which would not do. However, at last, I
made one to answer. I covered it with skins, the
hair outwards, so that it cast off the rain like a
penthouse, and kept off the sun so effectually, that
I could walk out, in the hottest of the weather,
with greater advantage than I could before in the
coolest; and when I had no need of it, I could
close it, and carry it under my arm.
Being eager to view the circumference of my
little kingdom, I resolved upon a tour, and accord-
ingly victualled my ship for the voyage, putting
in two dozen of my loaves of barley bread, an
earthen pot full of parched rice, a kind of food I
ate a great deal of, a little bottle of rum, half a
goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and
two large watch-coats, of those which, as I men-
tioned before, I had saved out of the seamen's
chests; these I took, one to He upon, and the other
to cover me in the night.
It was the 6th of Norember, in the sixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, that I set out on this
voyage, and 1 found it much longer than I ex-
pected; for though the island itself was not very
large, yet, when I came to the east side of it, I
found a great ledge of rocks lie out above two
leagues into the sea, some above water, and some
under it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying
dry, half a league or more, so that I was obliged
to go a great way out to sea to double that point.
When first I discovered them, I was going to give
over my enterprise, and come back, not knowing
how far it might oblige me to go out to sea, and,
above all, doubting bow I should get land made
again; so I came to anchor, for I had made myself
a kind of anchor with a piece of grappling, which
I had got out of the ship.
Having secured my boat, I took my gun, and
went on shore, climbing up a hill, which seemed
to overlook that poiat, where I saw the full extent
of it, and resolved to venture. In viewing the sea
from that hill where I stood, I perceived a strong
and furious current, which ran to the east and. even
came close to the point; and I took more notice of
it, because I saw there might be some danger, that
when I came into it, I might be carried out to sea
by the strength of it, and not be able to make the
island again. And, indeed, had I not gotten first
upon this hill, I believe it would have been so ; for
there were the same currents upon the other side
of the island, only that it set off at a further dis-
tance, and I saw there was a strong eddy under
the shore, so that I had nothing to do but to get
out of the first current, and I should presently b«
in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days, because the wind
blowing pretty fresh, (at E. S. E., and that being
just contrary to the said current,) made a breach
of the sea upon the point; so that it was not safe
for me to keep too close to the shore, for the breach
of the sea, nor to go too far off because of the
stream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the eea was calm, and I ven-
tured; but no sooner was I come to the point,
where even I was not a boat's length from the
shore, but I found myself in a great depth of water,
and a current like the sluice of a mill. It carried
my boat along with it, with such violence, that all
I could do, I could not keep her as much as on the
edge of it; but I found it hurried me farther out
from the eddy, which was on the left hand. There
was no wind stirring to help me, and all that I
could do with my paddles signified nothing; and
now I began to give myself over for lost: for, as
the current was on both sides of the island, I knew
that in a few leagues distance they must join
again, and then I was irrecoverably gone, cor did
I see any possibility of avoiding it, so that I had
no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the
sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for
hunger.
It is scarce possible to imagine the consternation
I was now in, being driven from my beloved island
into the wide ocean, almost two leagues, and in
the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.
However, I worked hard, till indeed my strength
was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as much
to the northward, that is, towards the side of the
current which the eddy lay on, as I possibly could.
When about noon, as the sun passed the meridian,
I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face,
spring from the S. S. E. This cheered my heart a
little, and especially when, in about half an hour
more, it blew a pretty gentle gale. By this time I
was gotten to a frightful distance from the island,
and had the least cloudy or hazy weather intervened,
I had been done another way too; for I had no
compass on board, and should never have known
how to have steered towards the island, if I had
but once lust sight of it; but the weather continu-
ing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast
again, and spread my sail, standing away to the
north as much as possible, to get out of the current.
Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat be-
gan to stretch away, I saw, even by the clearness
of the water, some alteration in the current was
near, for where the current was strong, the water
was very foul; but perceiving the water clear, I
found the current abate, and presently I found to
the east, about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon
some rocks; these rocks I found caused the cur-
rent to part again, and as the main stress of it ran
away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of
the rocks, and made a strong eddy, which ran back
again towards the north-west, with a very sharp
stream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them on the ladder, or to be rescued
from the thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such like extremities, may guess what
my present surprise was, and how gladly I put my
boat into the stream of this eddy, and the wind
also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it,
running cheerfully before the wind, and with a
strong tide or eddy under foot. This eddy carried
me abont a league in my way back again, directly
towards the island, but about two leagues more to
a
the northward than the current lay, which carried
me away at first ; so that when I came near the
island, I found myself open to the northern shore of
it, that is to say, the other end of the island, oppo-
site to that which I went out from. When I had
made something more than a league of way, by the
help of this current or eddy, I found it was spent,
and served me no farther. However, I found that
being between the two great currents, viz., that on
the south side, which had hurried me away, and
that on the north; which lay about two leagues on
the other side; I say, between these two, in the
west of the island, I found the water at least still,
and running no way; and having still a breeze of
wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for the
island, though not making such way as I did be-
fore.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then
within about a league of the island, I found the
point of the rocks, which had occasioned this dis-
aster stretching out as is described before, to the
southward, and casting off the current more south-
wardly, had, of course, made another eddy to the
north; and this I found very strong, but not di-
rectly setting the way the course lay, which was
due west, but almost full north. However, having
a fresh gale, I stretched across the eddy slanting
north-west, and in about half an hour came within
a mile of the shore, where, it being smooth water,
I soon got to land.
I was now at a great loss which way to get
home with my boat. I had run so much hazard,
and knew too much the canse, to think of attempt-
ing it by the way I went out; and what might be
at the other side, (I mean the west side,) I knew
not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures:
so I only resolved in the morning to make my way
westward along the shore, and see if there was no
creek where I might lay up the frigate in safety, so
as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three miles coasting along the shore, I came to a
very good inlet, or bay, about a mile over, which
narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet or
brook, where I found a convenient harbour for my
boat, and where she lay as if she had been in a little
dock made on purpose for her; here I put in, and
having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore
to look about me, and see where I was.
I soon found I had but a little passed by the
place where I had been before, when I travelled on
foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of my
boat, but my gun and my umbrella, for it was ex-
ceeding hot, I began my march. The way was
comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had
been upon, and 1 reached my old bower in the
evening, where I found every thing standing as I
left.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
shade to rest my limbs; for I was weary, and fell
asleep. But judge what surprise I must be in,
when I was awaked out of my sleep, by a voice
calling me several times, "Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe! poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you,
Robin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you
been?"
However, even though I knew it was a parrot,
it was a good while before I could compose my-
self. I was at first amazed how fihe creature got
thither, and how he should just keep about the
place, and no where else. But as I was well sa-
tisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got
over it; and holding out my hand, and calling him
by his name, Poll, the sociable creature, came to
mi•, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and
continued talking to me, Poor Robinson Crusoe!
and How did I come here? and where bad I been?
just as if he had been overjoyed to see me again;
so I carried him home with ine.
I had now had enough of rambling to sea for
some time, aud had enough to do for many days to
sit still and reflect upon the danger I had been in.
I would have been very glad to have my boat again
on my side of the island; but I knew not how it
was practicable to get it about. As to the east
side of theisland, which I had gone round, I knew
well enough there was no venturing that way; my
very heart would shrink, and my very blood ran
chill, but to think of it. And as to the other side
of the island, I did not know how it might be
there; but supposing the current ran with the
same force against the shore at the east, as it
passed by on the other, I might run the same risk
of being driven down the stream, and carried by
the island, as 1 had been before of being carried
away from it; so, with these thoughts,I contented
myself to be without any boat.
In this government of my temper I remained
near a year, living a very retired life, and my
thoughts being very much composed as to my con-
dition, and fully comforted in resigning myself to
the disposition of Providence, I thought I lived
very happily in all things, except that of society.
I improved myself in this time in all the mecha-
nical exercises which my necessities put me upon
applying myself to; and I believe I could, upon
occasion, have made myself a good carpenter,
considering what tools I had.
Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfec-
tion in my earthenware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a wheel, which I found infi-
nitely easier and better, because I made things
round and shapeable, - which before were filthy
things indeed to look on. But I think I never wan
more vain of my own performance, or more joyful
for any thing I found out, than for my being able
to make a tobacco pipe, and though it was a very
ugly, clumsy thing, when it was done, and ouly
burnt red like other earthenware, yet, as it was
hard and firm, and would draw the smoke, I was
exceedingly comforted with it; for I had been al-
ways used to smoke, and there were pipes in the
ship, but I had forgotten them at first, not knowing
there was any tobacco in the island, and after-
wards, when I searched the ship again, I could not
come at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I also improved very much,
and made abundance of necessary baskets, as well
as my invention shewed me, though not very hand-
some, yet they were such as were very handy and
convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and
dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it borne in
a basket; the like by a turtle, I would cut it up,
take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flesh,
which was enough for me, and bring them home,
and leave the rest behind me.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con-
siderably, and this was a want which it was im-
possible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider what I must do when I should have no
more powder, that is to say, how I should do to
kill any goats. I had, as I observed in the third
year of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred
her np tame. I was in hopes of getting a he-kid;
but I could not by any means bring it to pass, till
my kid grew an old goat, and I could never find in
my heart to kill her, till at last she died of mere
age.
Being now in the eleventh year of my residence,
and as I have said, my ammunition growing low,
I set myself to study some art to trap and snare
the goats, to see whether I could not catch some
of them alive, as I wanted a she-goat, great with
young.
To this purpose I made snares to hamper them,
and I do believe that they were more than once
taken in by them, but my tackle was not good, for
I had no wire, as I found them broken and my bait
devoured.
At length I resolved to try a pit-fall; so I dug
several large pits in the earth, in places where I
had observed the goats used to feed, and over these
pits I placed hurdles of my own making too, with
a great weight upon them; and several times I put
ears of barley and dry rice, without setting a trap,
and I could easily perceive that the goats had gone
in, and eaten up the corn, for I could see the mark
of their feet. At length I set three traps in one
uight, and going the next morning, I found them,
all standing, and the bait eaten. This was very
discouraging, but I altered my traps: and, going
one morning I found a large he-goat, three kids, a
male and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was so fierce that I durst not go into the
pit to him, that is to say, to go to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
killed him, but that was not my business, nor
would it answer my end; so I even let him out,
and be ran away as if he had been frightened out
of his wits, but I had forgot then what I learned
afterwards, that hunger will tame a lion. If I had
let him stay there three or (our days without food,
and then have carried him some water to drink,
and then a little corn, he would have been as tame
as one of the kids, for they are very tractable, when
they are well used.
However, for the present I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to the three
kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them with
strings together, and with difficulty brought them
home.
It was some time before they wonld feed; but
by throwing them some sweet corn, I tempted them,
and they began to be tame. And now I found,
that if I expected to supply myself with goat's flesh,
when I had neither powder nor shot left, breeding
soi»e up tame was my only way, when perhaps I
might have them about my bouse like a flock of
sheep.
But then it presently occurred to me that I must
keep the tame from the wild, or else they would
always grow wild when they grew up; and the
only way for this was to have some enclosed piece
of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale,
to keep them up so effectually, that they could not
mix together.
This was a great undertaking for one pair of
hands, yet, as I saw there was an absolute neces-
sity to do it, my first piece of work was to find
out a proper piece of ground, viz., where there
was likely to be plenty of herbage for them to eat,
water for them to drink, and cover to keep them
from the sun.
The place I pitched upon was a plain open piece
of meadow land, or savanna, which had two or
three little rills of fresh water in it, and at one end
was very woody. They may smile at my forecast
when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this
piece of ground in such a manner, that my hedge
or pale must have been at least two miles about;
nor was the madness of it so great as to the com-
pass, for if it had been ten miles about, I was like
to have had time enough to do it in, but I did not
consider that my goats would be as wild in so
much compass, as if they had had the whole island,
and I should have so much room to chase them in,
that I should never catch them.
My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe,
about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to
me, so I presently stopped short, and for the first
time, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one
hundred and fifty yards in length, and one hundred
yards in breadth, which, as it would maintain as
many as I should have in any reasonable time, so
as my flock increased, I could add more ground to
my enclosure.
This was acting with some prudence, and I went
to work with courage. I was about three months
hedging in the first piece, and, till I had done it, 1
tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and
used to feed them as near to me as possible, to
make them familiar; and very often I would go
and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of
rice, and feed them out of my hand, so that, after
my enclosure was finished, and I let them loose,
they would follow me up and down, bleating after
me for some corn.
This answered my end, and in about a year and
a half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids
and all, and in two years more I had forty-three,
besides several that I took and killed for my food;
and after that I enclosed five several pieces of
ground to feed them in, with little pens to drive
them into, to take them as I wanted them.
But this was not all: for now I not only had
goat's flesh to feed on when I pleased, but milk
4
too. a thing which indeed in the beginning I did
not so much as think of, and, which, when it came
into my thoughts, was really an agreeable surprise;
for now 1 set up my dairy, and had sometimes a
gallon or two of milk in a day. And as nature,
who gives supplies of food to every creature, dic-
tates how to make use of it, so that I that never
had milked a cow, much less a goat, or saw butter
or cheese made, managed to make both.
It would have made a stoic smile to have seen
me and my little family sit down to dinner. There
was my majesty, the prince and the lord of the whole
island. I had the lives of all my subjects at my
command. I could hang, draw, give liberty, and
take it away, and had no rebels among all my
subjects.
Then to see how like a king I dined, too, at-
tended by my servants; Poll, as if she had been
my favourite, was the only one permitted to talk
to me: my dog, who was now grown very old and
crazy, sat always at my right hand: and two cats,
one on each side.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on shore at first, for they were both of them dead;
but one of them having multiplied by I know not
what kind of creature, these were two which I
had preserved tame, whereas the rest ran wild in
the woods, and became troublesome to me; for
they would often come into my house and plunder
me, till at last I was obliged to shoot them and
kill a great many. And in this plentiful manner I
lived; neither could I be said to want anything
• but society, and of that, in some time after this, I
was like to have too much.
I was impatient, as I before observed, to have
the use of my boat, though loath to run any more
hazard, and therefore sometimes I sat contriving
a 2
ways to get her about the island, and at other
times I sat myself down contented enough without
her. But I had a strange uneasiness in my mind
to go down to the point of the island, where, as, I
have said, in my last ramble, I went up the hill to
see bow the shore lay, and how the current set.
This inclination increased upon me every day, and
following the edge of the shore, I did so, but had
any one in England met such a man as I was, I
must either have frightened him, or raised a good
deal of laughter, and as I frequently stood still to
look at myself, I could not but smile at. the notion
of my travelling through Yorkshire with such an
equipage, and in such a dress. Be pleased to take
a sketch of my figure as follows;—I had a great
high shapeless cap, made of a goat's skin, with a
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun
from me, as to shoot the rain off from running into
my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these climates
as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.
I had a short jacket of goat's skin, the skirts
hanging down to about the middle of my thighs;
and a pair of open kneed breeches; the breeches
were made of the skin of an old he-goat whose
hair hung down such a length on either side, that
like pantaloons, it reached to the middle of my
legs. Stockings and shoes I had none: but I had
made a pair of something, I scarce know what to
call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs.
I had on a broad belt of goat's skin dried, which
I drew together with two thongs of the same,
instead of buckles; and, in a kind of frog on each
side of this, hung a saw and a hatchet. I had
another belt not so broad, fastened in the same
manner, which hung over my shoulder; and at
the end of it, hung two pouches, in which I kept
my powder and shot. At my back I carried my
basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my head
a great, clumsy, goat's skin umbrella, but which,
after all, was the most necessary thing I bad about
me, next to my gun. As for my face, the colour of
it was really not so mulatto like as one might ex-
pect from a man not at all careful of it, and living
within nine or ten degrees of the equator. My
beard, 1 had once suffered to grow till it was
about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had
scissors and razors, I had cut it pretty short, ex-
cept what grew upon my upper lip, which I had
trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers
such as I had seen worn by some Turks whom I
saw in Sallee. Of these mustachios or whiskers,
I must say they were monstrous, and would in
England be thought frightful.
In this kind of figure I went on my journey, and
was out fire or six days. I travelled first along
the sea-shore, directly to the place where I first
brought my boat to anchor, to get upon the rocks;
and not having any coat now to take care of, I
went over the land a nearer way, to the same
height I was upon before, when, looking forward
to the point of the rocks which lay out, and which
I was to double with my boat, as I said above, I
was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet;
no rippling, no motion, no current, any more there
than in other places.
I was at a strange loss to understand this, and
resolved to spend some time in observing it, to see
if nothing but the sets of the tide had occasioned
it. But I was perfectly convinced how it was,
viz., that the tide of ebbing, setting from the west,
and joining the current of waters from some great
river on the shore, must be the occasion of this
current; and that, according as the wind blew
more forcibly from the west, or from the north, this
current came near, or went farther from the shore;
for, waiting there till about evening, I went op to
the rock again, and then the tide of ebb being
made, I plainly saw the current again as before,
only that it ran farther off, being near half a league
from the shore; whereas, in my case, it set close
upon the shore, and hurried me in my canoe along
with it, which it would not do before.
This observation convinced me that I had no-
thing to do but observe the ebbing and flowing of
the tide, and I might very easily bring a boat
about the island again; but when I began to think
of putting it in practice, I had such a terror upon
my spirits at the remembrance of the danger I
had been in, that I could not think of it again
with patience; but, on the contrary, I took up
another resolution, which was more safe, though
more laborious, and this was, that I would make
me another periagua, or canoe, and so have one on
each side of the island.
You are to understand that I now had, as I may
call it, two plantations on the island; one my little
fortification or tent; then the wall about it under the
rock, with the cave behind me, which, by this time,
I had enlarged into several apartments, or caves,
one within another. One of these, which was the
driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortification, was all filled np with large
earthen pots, and with fourteen or fifteen great
baskets, which would hold five or six bushels
each, where I laid up my stores of provisions,
especially my corn, some in the ear cut off short
from the straw, and the other rubbed out with my
bands.
As for my wall, made, as I said before, with
long stakes or piles, those piles grew all like trees,
and were by this time grown so big, and spread so
very much, that there was not the least appearance
of any habitation behind them. Near this dwelling
of mine, but a little farther within the island, and
upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn-
ground, which I kept duly cultivated and sowed,
and which always yielded me their harvest in its
season; and whenever I had occasion for more
corn, I had more adjoining as fit as that.
Besides this, 1 had my country seat, and I had
now a tolerable plantation there, also. For, first I
had my little bower, as I called it, which I kept
in repair, that is to say, I kept the hedge which
circled it constantly fitted up to its usual height,
the ladder standing always in the inside. I kept
the trees, which were at first no more than my
stakes, which were now grown very firm and tall;
I kept them always so cut that they might spread,
and grow thick and wild, and make the more
agreeable shade, which they did effectually to my
mind. In the middle of this I had my tent always
standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles
set up for that purpose, and which never wanted
any repair or renewing; and under this I had
made a squab or couch, with the skins of the crea-
tures 1 killed, and with other soft things, and a
blanket laid on them, such as belonged to our sea-
bedding, which I had saved, and a great watch-
coat to cover me, and here, whenever I bad occasion
to be absent from my chief seat, I took my country
habitation.
Adjoining to this, I had my enclosures for my
goats; and as I had taken a deal of pains to fence
and enclose this ground, I was so uneasy least the
goats should break through, that I never left off,
till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of
the hedges so full of small stakes, and so near to
one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge
and there was scarce room to put one's hand
through between them, which afterwards, when
those stakes grew, as they did in the rainy season,
made the enclosures strong as a wall, indeed
stronger than any wall.
This will testify for me that I was not idle, and
that I spared no pains to bring to pass whatever
appeared necessary for my comfortable support;
for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame
creatures thus at my hand would be a living
magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me,
as long as ever I lived in the place, even if it were
to be forty years; and that keeping them within
my reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting
my enclosures to such a degree, that I might be
sure of keeping them together, which, by this
method, was effectually secured, and when these
little stakes began to grow, they were planted so
very thick, that I was forced to pull some of them
up again.
In this place also I had my grapes growing,
which I principally depended upon for my winter
store of raisins, and which I never failed to pre-
serve very carefully, as the best and most agree-
able dainty of my whole diet; and they were,
physical, wholesome, nourishing, and refreshing.
It happened one day about noon, going towards
my boat, I was greatly surprised with the print of
a man's naked foot upon the shore, which was very
plain to be seen on the sand. I stood like one
thunder-struck, or as if I had seen an apparition. I
listened; I looked round me; I could hear or see
nothing. T, went up to the rising ground to look
further. I went to it again to see if it might not
be fancy; but there was no room for that, for there
was exactly the very print of a foot, the toes, heel,
and every part of a foot; and how it came thither
I knew not, nor could I in the least imagine. But
after many fluttering thoughts, I came home to my
fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I
went on, but terrified to the last degree, looking
behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking
every bush and tree, and fancying every stump at
a distance to be a man. Nor is it possible to
describe how many various shapes an affrighted
imagination represented things to me in.
When I came to my castle, 1 fled into it like one
pursued; whether I went over by the ladder, as
at first contrived, or went in at the hole in the
rock, which I called a door, I cannot remember;
for never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to the
earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat.
1 had no sleep that night. The farther I was
away from the occasion of my fright, the greater
my apprehensions were; which is something con-
trary to the nature of such things, and especially
to the usual practice of all creatures of fear. But
I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas
of the thing, that I formed nothing but the most
dismal imaginations to myself, even though I was
a great way off it. Sometimes I fancied it must be
the devil; and reason joined in with me upon this
supposition; for how should any other thing in hu-
man shape come into the place? Where was the
vessel that brought them? What marks were
there of any other footsteps? And how was it
possible a man should come there? But then to
think that Satan should take the human shape upon
him in such a place, where there could be no man-
ner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his
foot behind him, and that even for no purpose, this
was an amazement to me the other way. I con-
sidered that the devil might have found out abun-
dance of other ways to have terrified me, than the
f
single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the
other side of the island, he would never have been
so simple as to leave a mark in a place where it
was ten thousand to one whether 1 should ever see
it or no, and in the sand, too, which the first surge
of the sea, upon a high wind, would have entirely
defaced. All these seemed inconsistent with the
notions we usually entertain of the subtlety of the
devil.
Such ideas as these assisted to argue me out of
all apprehensions of its being the devil: and I con-
cluded that it must be some more dangerous crea-
ture, viz., that it must be some of the savages from
the main land over against me, who had wandered
out to sea in their canoes, and either driven by the
current, or by contrary winds, bad made the island
and been on shore, but were gone away again to
sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have staid in this
miserable island, as I would have been to have had
them.
In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions,
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day,
that this might be a mere chimera of my own,
when I came on shore from my boat. This cheered
me up a little, and I began to persuade myself it
was my own imagination: but I could not per-
suade myself fully to this, till 1 should go down to
the shore again, and see this print of a foot, and
measure it by my own, and see if there was any
similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it was
my own foot.
But when I came to the place, it appeared evi-
dently to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could
not possibly be on shore any where thereabouts.
Secondly, when I came to measure the mark with
my foot, I found my foot not so large by a great
deal; both these things filled my head with new
imaginations, and gave me the vapours again, so
that I shook, like one in an ague, and I went home
again, filled with the belief that some man or men
had been on shore there; or, in short, that the
island was inhabited, and I might be surprised
before I was aware; and what course to take I
knew not.
Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dog
my cave so large as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely
considering this, I therefore resolved to draw a
second fortification, in the same manner of a semi-
circle, at a distance from my wall, where I had
planted a double row of trees, above twelve years
before, of which I made mention. These trees,
having been planted so thick before, there wanted
but a few piles to be driven between them, that
they might be much thicker and stronger, and my
wall would be soon finished.
So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
one was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and every thingl could think of to make it strong;
having in it seven little holes, about as big as I
could put my arm out at. In the inside of this I
thickened my wall to about ten feet thick, con-
tinually bringing earth out of my cave, and laying
it at the foot of my wall, and walking upon it, and
through the seven holes I contrived to plant the
muskets, of which I have mentioned that I got
seven on shore out of the ship; and these I planted
like cannon, and fitted them into frames that held
them like a carriage, so that I could fire all the
seven guns in two minutes' time. This wall I was
many a weary month in finishing, and yet never
thought myself safe till it was done.
When this was done, I stuck all my ground,
without my wall, for a great space every way, full
with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood, which
I found so apt to grow, as thick as they could stand,
insomuch that I believe there must have been near
twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty larga
space between them and my wall that I might have
room to see the enemy; and that they might have
no shelter from the young trees if they approached
my wall.
Thus, in two years' time, I had a thick grove;
and, in five or six years more I had a wood before
my dwelling, grown so monstrous thick and strong
that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no
man, of what kind soever, would imagine that
there was any thing beyond it, much less a habita-
tion. As for the way I proposed myself to go in
and out at (for I had left no avenue), it was by
setting two ladders, one to a part of the rock which
was low, and broke in, and left room to place
another ladder upon that, so when the two ladders
were taken down, no man living could come down
to me without injuring himself; and if they had
come down, they were still on the outside of my
outer wall.
Thus I took all the measures human prudence
could suggest for my own preservation: and it
will be seen, at length, that they were not al-
together without just reason, though I saw nothing
at that time, more than fear suggested tome.
While this was doing, I was not altogether care-
less of my other affairs; for I had great concern
upon me for my little herd of goats. They were
not only a present supply to me on every occasion,
and began to be sufficient for me, without the ex-
pense of powder and shot, but also abated the
fatigue of my banting after wild ones, and 1 was
loath to lose the advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurse up again.
To this purpose, I could think of but two ways
to preserve them; one was to find another covenient
place to dig a cave under ground, and to drive
them into it every night; and the other was to en-
close two or three little bits of land, remote from
one another, and as much concealed as could be,
•where I might keep about half a do/en young goats
in each place, so that if any disaster happened to
the flock in general, I might be able to raise them
again; and though it would require much time and
labour, I thought this was the best design.
Accordingly I spent some time to find out the
most retired parts of the island; and I pitched upon
one which was as private as my heart could wish;
for it was a little damp piece of ground in the mid-
dle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as I ob-
served, I almost lost myself once before, endeavour-
ing to come back that way from the eastern part of
the island. Here I found a clear piece of land, near
three acres, so surrounded with woods, that it was
almost an enclosure by Nature.
I immediately went to work at this piece of
ground, and, in less than a month's time, I had so
fenced it round, that my flock would be well
enough secured in it. So, without any further de-
lay, I removed ten she-goats and two he-goats to
the place: and when they were there, I continued
to perfect the fence, till I had made it as secure as
the other.
After I had thus secured one part of my living
stock, I went about the whole island, searching for
another private place, to make such another de-
posit; when wandering more to the west point of
the island than I had ever done yet, and looking
out to sea, I thought I saw a boat upon the sea, at
a great distance. I hud found a perspective glass
or two in one of the seamen's chests, which I had
saved out of our ship, but I had it not about me,
and this was so remote that I could not tell what
to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were
not able to look or to hold any longer. Whether it
was a boat or not, I did not know; but as I de-
scended from the hill, I could see no more of it, so
I gave it over; only I resolved to go no more
without a perspective glass.
Wben I was come down the hill, to the end of
the island, where I had never been before, I was
presently convinced that the seeing the print of a
man's foot was not such a strange thing as I ima-
gined in the island , and, but that it was a special
Providence that I was cast upon the side of the
island where the savages never came, I should have
easily known that nothing was more frequent than
128 ROBINSON CRUSOE.
to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot over to
that side of the island for harbour; likewise, as
they often met, and fought in their canoes, the
victors, having taken any prisoners, would bring
them over to this shore, where, according to their
dreadful custom, being all cannibals, they would
kill and eat them. Of which hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the shore, as
I said before, being the S. W. point of the island, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind,
at seeing the shore spread with skulls, hands, feet,
and other bones of human bodies; and particularly
I observed a place where there had been a fire
made, and a circle dug in the earth like a cock-pit,
at which it is supposed the savage wretches had
Bat down to their inhuman feastings upon the
bodies of their fellow-creatures.
I was bo astonished at the sight of these things,
that I entertained no notion of any danger to my-
self for a long while; all ray apprehensions were
buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy
of human nature, which, though I had heard of
often, yet I never had so near a view of before; in
short, I turned away my face from the horrid spec-
tacle; my stomach grew sick, and I was just at
the point of fainting, when nature discharged the
disorder from my stomach; and having vomited, I
was relieved, but could not bear to stay in the
place for a moment; so I got up the hill again,
with all the speed I could, and walked on towards
my habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the
island, I stood a little while amazed, and then reco-
vering myself, I looked up with the utmost affec-
tion of my soul, and with a flood of tears in my
eyes, gave God thanks, that had cast my first lot in
a part of the world, where I was distinguished
from such dreadful creatures as these, and that
though I had esteemed my present condition very
miserable, had yet given me so many comforts in it,
that I had still more io give thanks for, than to
complain of; and this above all, that I had, even
in this miserable condition, been comforted with
the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of His
blessing, which was a felicity more than sufficiently
equivalent to all the misery which I had suffered, or
could suffer.
Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I
was in no danger of being discovered by these peo-
ple, began to wear off my uneasiness about them,
and I began to live just in the same composed
manner as before, only with this difference, that I
used more caution, and kept my eyes more about
me than I did before, lest I should happen to be
seen by any of them; and particularly I was more
cautious in firing my gun, lest any of them being
on the island they should happen to hear it; and it
was therefore a very good Providence to me that I
had furnished myself with a tame breed of goats,
that I needed not bunt any more about the woods,
or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them
after this, it was by traps and snares, as I had
done before; so that for two years after this I
believe 1 never fired my gun once off, though I
never went out without it; and, which was more,
as I had saved three pistols out of the ship, and
made me a belt to put them in also; so that I was
now a most formidable fellow to look at when I
went abroad, if you add to the former description
of myself the particulars of two pistols, and a
great broad-sword hanging at my side in a belt,
without a scabbard.
As in my present condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, so, indeed I thought,
that the frights 1 had been in about these savage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my
own preservation, had taken off- the edge of my
invention for my own convenience; and I had
dropped a good design, which I had once bent my
thoughts upon, and that was, to try if I could not
make some of my barley into malt, and then try to
brew myself some beer. This was really a whim-
sical thought, and I reproved myself often for the
simplicity of it, for I presently saw there would
be the want of several things necessary to the
making my beer that it would be impossible for me
to supply; as first, casks to preserve it in, which
was a thing that, as I have observed already, 1
could never compass, no, though I spent not many
days, but weeks, nay months, in attempting it, but
to no purpose. In the next place, I had no hops
to make it keep, no yeast to make it: work, and no
copper to boil it in; and yet, had not all these
intervened, I mean the frights and terrors I was in
about the savages, I had undertaken it, and pur-
haps brought it to pass too: for I seldom gave
over anything without accomplishing it, when I
once had it in my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way,
for night and day I could think of nothing but how
I might destroy some of these monsters in their
cruel and bloody entertainment, and, if possible
save the victim they should bring hither to destroy.
It would take up a larger volume than this whole
work is intended to be, to set down all the con»
trivances I laid down in my thoughts, for destroy-
ing these creatures, or at least frightening them, so
as to prevent their coming hither any more, but all
was abortive; nothing could be possible to take
effect, unless 1 was there to do it myself; and
what could one man do among them, when, per-
haps, there might be twenty or thirty of them to-
gether, with their darts, or their bows and arrows,
with which they could shoot as true at a mark as
I could with my gun.
I went so far with it in my imagination, that I
spent several days to find out proper places to put
myself in ambuscade, to watch for them, and I
went frequently to the place itself; but the horror
I had at the place, and at the signals of the bar-
barous wretches devouring one another, made me
shudder.
At length I found a place in the side of the hill,
where I was satisfied I might securely wait till I
saw any of their boats coming, and might then,
even before they would be ready to come on shore,
convey myself unseen into the thickest of the trees,
in one of which there was a hollow largo enough to
conceal me entirely, and where I might sit and
observe all their bloody doings, and take aim at
their heads, when they were so close together as
that it would be nearly impossible that I should
miss them, or that I could fail wounding three or
four at the first shot.
In this place, then, I resolved to fix my design,
and accordingly I prepared two muskets, and my
fowling pieces. The two muskets I loaded with a
brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets,
about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling
piece I loaded with nearly a handful of swan shot,
of the largest size. I also loaded my pistols with
about four bullets each; and, in this posture, well
provided with ammunition for a second or third
charge, I prepared myself for the exhibition.
After I had thus laid the scheme ior my design, I
made the tour every morning to the top of the hill,
which was from the castle as I called it, about three
miles or more, to see if I could observe any boats
upon the sea, coming near the island, or standing
towards it; but I began to tire of this hard duty,
after I had for two or three months constantly
kept my watch, and come always back without a
discovery, there having not in all that time been the
least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but
not on the whole ocean, so far as my eyes or glasses
could reach every way. As long as I kept up my
daily tour to the hill to look out, so long also I
kept up the vigour of my design; and my spirits
seemed to be all the while in a suitable frame for so
outrageous an execution as the killing of twenty or
thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had
not at all entered into a discussion of in my
thoughts any farther than my passions were at first
fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural
custom of the people of that country, who, it seems
had been suffered by Providence, in his wise disposi-
tion of the world, to have no other guide than that
of their own abominable and vitiated passions, and
consequently were lelt, and perhaps had been for
ages, to act such horrid things, and receive such
horrid customs, as nothing but nature, entirely
abaudoned by heaven, could have led them into.
But then after cool reflection, I began to consider
what it was 1 was going to engage in; what au-
thority or call I had to pretend to be judge and ex-
ecutioner upon these men as criminals, whom God
had thought fit, for so many ages, to suffer, unpun-
ished, to go on, and to be, as it were, the execu-
tioners ol bis judgments upon one another.
When I had considered this a little, it followed
necessarily that I was certaiuly in the wrong in it;
that these people were not murderers in the sense
that I had before condemned them in my thoughts,
any more than those Christians were murderers
who often put to death the prisoners taken in bat-
tle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put
whole troops of them to the sword, without giving
quarter, though they threw down their arms and
submitted.
These considerations put me to the pause, and I
began to conclude that I had taken wrong measures
in my resolution to atrack the savages; that it was
not my t usiness to meddle with them, unless they
first attacked me, and this it was my business, if
possible, to prevent; but what if I were discovered
and attacked, then I knew, my duty.
Upon the whole, I concluded that neither in
principle nor policy I ought, one way or other, to
concern myself in this affair; that my business was
by all possible means to conceal myself from them,
H
and not to leave the least signal for them to guess
that there were living human beings upon the island.
In this disposition I continued for near a year,
and in all that time I never went up the hill to see
whether there were any of them in sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on shore there
or not; only this I did, I went and removed my
boat, which I had on the other side of the island,
and carried it down to the east end of the whole
island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I
found under some high rocks, and where I knew,
by reason of the currents, the savages durst not,
at least, would not, come with their boats, upon
any account whatever.
With my boat I carried away every thing I had
left there belonging to it, viz., a mast and sail,
which I had made for it, and a thing like an anchor.
All those I removed, that there might not be the
least shadow of any discovery, or any appearance
of any human habitation upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself more retired than
ever, and seldom went from my castle, except to
milk my she goats, and manage my little flock in
the wood, which, as it was on the other part of the
island, was quite out of danger; for the savages
seldom wandered off from the coast.
I had the care of my safety more now upon my
hands than that of my food. I dared not to drive
a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the
noise I should make would be heard, and much lusa
would I fire a gun for the same reason: and above
all, I was very uneasy at making any fire, lest the
smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the
day, should betray me; and for this reason I re-
moved that part of my business which required fire,
such as burning of pots and pipes, &c., into my new
apartment in the woods, where, after I had been
some time, I found to my unspeakable consolation,
a more natural cave in the earth, which went a vast
way, and where, I dare say, no savage, had he
been at the mouth of it, would be so hardy as to
venture in: nor indeed would any man else, but
one who, like me, wanted nothing so much as a
safe retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of
a great rock, where I was cutting down some thick
branches of trees to make charcoal; and before I
go on, I must observe the reason of my making
this charcoal, which was this;—I was afraid of
making a smoke about my habitation as I said
Before: and yet I could not lire there without
making my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I
contrived to burn some wood here, as I had seen
done in England, under turf till it became charcoal
or dry coal; and then putting the fire out, I pre-
served the coal to carry home, and performed the
other services which fire was wanting for at home,
without smoke.
While I was cutting down some wood here, I
perceived that, behind a very thick branch of low
brushwood or underwood, there was a kind of hol-
low place. I was curious to look into it, and get-
ing with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found it
was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me
to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with
me; but I must confess to you, I made more haste
out than I did in, when looking farther into the
place, which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad
shining eyes of some creature, whether devil or
man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars;
the dim light from the cave's mouth shining directly
in, and making the reflection.
However, after some time, I recovered myself,
and began to call myself a thousand fools, and tell
myself, that he that was afraid to Bee the devil,
was not fit to live twenty years in an island all
alone, and that perhaps there was nothing in this
cave that was more frightful than myself. Upon
this, plucking up my courage, I took up a firebrand,
and in I rushed again, with the stick in my hand.
I had not gone in above three steps but I was al-
most as frightened as before, for I heard a very
loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it
was followed by a noise, like words half expressed,
and then a deep sign again. I stepped back, and
indeed was so struck with surprise, that it put me
into a cold sweat; and if I had had a hat on my
head, I think my hair would have lifted it off?
Bat still plucking up my spirits, as well as I could
and encouraging myself a little with considering
that the power and presence of God was every-
where to protect me, I stepped forward again, and
by the light of the firebrand, I saw lying on the
ground, a monstrous old he-goat, dying of old age.
I stirred him a little, to see if I could get him
out; and he strived to get up, but he was not able
to raise himself, and I thought he should even lie
there; for if he had frightened me so, he would
certainly frighten any one of the savages, if any of
them should be hardy enough to come in there,
while he had life in him.
I was now recovered from surprise, and began
to look around me, when I found that the cave was
but small; that is to say, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of shape, either round
or square; no hands having ever been employed
in making it but those of mere nature. I observed
also that there was a place at the far side of it
that went in further, but was so low that it re-
quired me to creep upon my hands and knees to go
into it, and whether it went I knew not; so, having:
do candle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved
to come again the next day, provided with a candle
and tinder-box, which I made of the lock of a mus-
ket, with some wildfire in a pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
six large candles made of goat's tallow : and going
into this place, I was obliged to creep upon all
fours, as I have said, almost ten yards, which by
the way, I thought was a venture bold enough,
considering that I knew not how far it would go,
or what was beyond it.
The place I was in was as delightful a grotto, of
its kind, as could be expected, though perfectly
dark; the floor was dry and level, and had a sort
of small loose gravel upon it, so that there was no
nauseous or venomous creatures to be seen; nor
was there any damp or wet on the side or roof.
The only difficulty in it was the entrance; which,
however, as it was a place of security, and such a
retreat as I wanted, I thought that it was a con-
venience; so that I was really rejoiced at the dis-
covery; and resolved, without any delay, to bring
some of those things which I was most anxious
about, to this place; particularly, I resolved to
bring here my magazine of powder, and all my
spare arms, viz., two fowling pieces and three
muskets; so T kept at my castle only five, which
stood ready mounted, like pieces of cannon, on my
outermost fence, and were ready also to take out
upon an expedition.
On the occasion of removing my ammunition I
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the sea, and which had been wet;
and I found that the water had penetrated about
three or four inches into the powder on every side,
which caking and growing hard, had preserved the
B 2
inside like a kernel in a shell, so that I had sixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the
cask; and this was an agreeable discovery to me
at this time; BO I carried all away thither, never
keeping above two or three pounds of powder with
me in my castle, for fear of a surprise of any kind.
I also carried thither all my lead I had left for
bullets.
It was now the month of December, in the
twenty-third year of my sojourn on the island, and
this being the southern solstice, for winter 1 cannot
call it, was the particular time of my harvest, and
required my being pretty much abroad in the fields;
when going ont pretty early one morning, even
before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised
with seeing a light of some fire upon the shore, at
a distance from me of about two miles, towards
the end of the island where I had observed some
savages had been before, but on the other side; but
now, to my great affliction, it was on my side of
the island.
I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and
stopped short within my grove, not daring to go
out, lest I might be surprised: and yet I had no
more peace within, from the apprehension I had
that if these savages in rambling over the island,
should find my corn standing, or cut, or any of my
works or improvements, they would immediately
conclude that there were people in that place, and
would then never give over till they fouud me out.
In this extremity I went back directly to my castle,
and pulled up the ladder after me, having made all
things without look as wild and natural as possible.
Then I prepared myself within, putting myself
in a posture of defence. I loaded all my cannon
as I called them, that is to say, my muskets, which
were mounted upon my new fortification, and all
my pistols, and resoh-ed to throw myself on the
Divine protection, and earnestly pray to God to
deliver me out of the hands of the barbarians; and
in this posture I continued for about two hours,
but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence
abroad.
After sitting a while and musing what I should
do in this case, as I could not bear sitting in
ignorance any longer, so setting up my ladder to
the side of the hill, where there was a flat place, as
I observed before, and then pulling the ladder up
after me, I set it again, and mounted to the top of
the hill, and pulling out my perspective glass,
which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat
on my belly upon the ground, and began to look
for the place. I presently found that there were
no less than nine naked savages sitting round a
small fire they had made, not to warm them, they
had no need of that, the weather being extremely
hot, but as I supposed, to dress some of their bar-
barous dii-t of human flesh, which they had brought
along with them, whether alive or dead I could
not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
hauled up upon the shore; and, as it was the ebb
of the tide, they seemed to wait the return of the
flood to go away again. It is not easy to imagine
what confusion this sight put me into, especially
seeing them come on my side of the island, and so
near me too; but when I observed their coming
must be always with the current or the ebb, I
began afterwards to be more sedate in my mind,
being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety
all the time of tide or flood, if they were not or
shore before; and having made this observation I
went abroad about my harvest work with the more
composure.
As I expected, so it proved; for, as soon as the
tide made to the westward, I saw them all take
boat and row away. I should have observed, they
were all quite naked, and for an hour and more be-
fore they went off, they went to dancing, and I
could easily discern their grotesque postures and
gestures by my glasses.
As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took
two guns upon my shoulder, and two pistols at my
girdle, and my great sword by my side, without a
scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to
make, I went away to the hill where I had dis-
covered the first appearance of all. As soon as I
got thither, which was not less than two hours, I
perceived there had been three canoes more of
savages on that place, and looking out further, I
saw they were all at sea together, making over for
the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me; especially when
going down to the shore, I could see with horror
the dismal work they had been about, viz., the
blood and bones, and part of the flesh of human
bodies, eaten and devoured by these wretches with
merriment and sport. I was so filled with indig-
nation at the sight, that I began now to premedi-
tate the destruction of the next that I saw there,
let them be who or how many soever.
It seemed evident to me, that the visits which
they thus made to this island were not very fre-
quent; for it was above fifteen months before any
more of them came on shore there again; and I
found they did not come in the rainy season; yet
all this while I lived very uncomfortably, by reason
of the constant apprehensions I was in of their
coming upon me by surprise.
During all this time, I was in the murdering
humour, and took up most of my hours, which
would have been better employed, in contriving
how to fall upon them the very next time I should
see them, especially if they should be divided, as
they were the last time, into two parties: nor did
I consider at all that if I killed one party, suppose
ten or a dozen, I was still the next day, or week,
or month, to kill another, and so another, even ad
infinitum till I should be no less a murderer than
they were in being man eaters, and perhaps much
more so.
I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or
other (all into the hands of these merciless creatures.
And now I found to my great comfort, how happy
it was that I had provided a tame flock of goats,
for I durst not, upon any account, fire my gun,
especially near the side of the island where they
usually came, lest it should alarm the savages; for
if they had fled from me now, they would perhaps
have come back again, with a great number more,
and then I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months
more, before I saw any more of the savages: but
in the month of May, as near as I could calculate,
and in my four-and-twentieth year, I had a very-
strange encounter with them, of which in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or sixteen months' interval, was very great. In the
day, great trouble overwhelmed my mind; in the
night, I dreamed often of killing savages, and the
reasons why I might justify the doing of it. But
to waive all this for a while, it was in the middle
of May, on the 16th day, I think, that it blew a very
great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of
lightning and thunder, and a very foul night it was.
I know not what was the particular occasion of it,
but as I was reading the Bible, and taken up with
serious thoughts about my present condition, 1 was
surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought,
tired at sea.
This was, to be sure, a surprise of quite a differ-
ent nature from any that I had met with before,
for, the.notions which this put into my head were
quite of another kind. I started.up in the greatest
haste imaginable, and in a trie*, clapped up my
ladder to the middle place of the rock, and pulled it
up after me, and mounting it the second time, I
got to the top of the hill: that moment a flash of
fire bade me listen for a second gun, which, accor-
dingly, in about half a minute I heard, and by the
sound, I knew that it was from that part of the
sea where I was drisen out with the current in my
boat.
I immediately considered that this must be some
ship in distress, and that they had some comrade,
or some other ship in company, and fired these guns
for signals of distress, and to obtain help. I had
such presence of mind at that minute, as to think,
that though I could not help them, it might be that
they could help me; so I brought together all the
dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good
sized pile, I set it on fire upon the hill, the wood
was dry and it blazed freely; and though the wind
blew very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, so that I
was certain, if there was any such thing as a ship,
they must needs see it, and no doubt they did, for
as soon as my fire blazed, I heard another gun, and
after that several others, all from the same quarter.
I piled my fire all night long, till day broke; and
when it was broad day and the air cleared up, I
saw something at a great distance at sea, full east
of the island, but whether a sail or a hull, I could
not distinguish; no, not with my glasses, the dis-
tance was so great, and the weather being: hazy
also; at least it was so out at sea.
I looked frequently at it all the day, and soon
perceived that it did not move; so I presently con-
cluded that it was a ship at anchor, and being very
eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied I took my
gun in my hand, an&ran towards the south east
side of the island, to the rocks, where I had been
formerly carried away by the current, and getting
up there, the weather by this time being perfectly
clear, I could plainly see, to my great sorrow, the
wreck of a ship cast away in the night upon these
concealed rocks, which I found when I was out in
my boat, and which rocks, as they checked the
violence of the stream, and made a kind of counter
stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering
from the most desperate and hopeless condition I
had ever been in.
I cannot explain by words, what a strange lodg-
ing or hankering of desire I felt in my sonl upon
this sight, breaking out sometimes thus,—" Oh, that
there had been but one or two, nay, but one soul
saved out of the ship, to have escaped to me, that
I might have had one companion, one fellow crea-
ture to have spoken to me, and to have conversed
with me!" In all the time of my solitary life, I
never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the
society of my fellow creatures, or so deep a regret
at the want of it.
Such were these earnest wishings, that but one
man had been saved. Oh, that it had been hut one
and I believe that I repeated the words '< Oh, that
it had been but one I" a thousand times; and my
desires were so moved by it, that when I spoke the
words, my hands would clench together, and my
fingers press the palms of my hands, that if I had
any thing soft in my hand it would have crushed it;
and my teeth in my head would strike together,
and set against one another so strong, that for some
time I could not part them again.
Let naturalists explain these things, and the
reason and manner of them; all I can do is, to de-
scribe the fact, which was surprising to me when I
found it, though I knew not from what it should
proceed; it was, doubtless the effect of my ardent
wishes, and strong ideas formed in my mind, re-
alising the comfort which the conversation of one
of my fellow-christians would have been to me.
But it was not to he; either their fate or mine,
or both, forbade it; for, till the last jear of my
being in this island, I never knew whether any
were saved out of the ship or not; and had only
the affliction, some days after, to see the corpse of
a drowned boy washed ashore, at the end of the
island which was next the wreck. He had on a
seaman's waistcoat, a pair of open kneed linen
drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to
direct me to guess what nation he was of. He had
nothing in his pockets but two pieces of eight and
a tobacco pipe. The last was of more value to me
than the first.
It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven-
ture out in my boat to this wreck, not doubting but
I might find something on board that might he
useful to me; and possibly there might yet be some
living creature on board, whose life might comfort
my own to the highest degree; and tl.is ti ought
clung so much to my heart that I could not be easy
by night or by day, but 1 must venture out in my
boat to go on board this wreck.
Under this impression I hastened back to my
castle, prepared everything for my voyage, took a
quantity of bread, a great pot of fresh water, a
compass to steer by, a bottle ol rum (for 1 had
still a great deal of that left), a basket full of
raisins, and thus loading myself with everything
necessary, I went down to my boat, got the water
put of her, and got her afloat, loaded .'all my cargo
in her, and then went home for more. My second
cargo was a great bag full of rice, the umbrella
to set up over my head for a shade, another pot
full of fresh water, and about two dozen of my
email loaves, or barley cakes, more than before,
with a bottle of goats' milk, and a cheese: all
which, with great labour and sweat, I brought to
my boat, and praying to God to direct my voyage,
I put off, and rowing or paddling the canoe along
the shore, I came at last to the utmost point of the
island, on that side, viz., N. E. And now I was to
launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or
not venture. I looked on the rapid currents which
ran constantly on both sides of the island, at a dis-
tance, and which were very terrible to me, from
the remembrance of the hazard I had been in there
before; and my heart began to fail me, for I fore-
saw, that if I was driven into either of these cur-
rents, I should be carried a vast way out to sea,
and perhaps out of reach or sight of the island
again; and that, as my boat was but small, if any
little gale of wind should arise, I should inevitably
be lost.
These thoughts so oppressed my mind, that I be-
gan to gire over my enterprise, and having hauled
my boat into a little creek on the shore, I stepped
out, and sat me down upon a little spot of rising
ground, very pensive and anxious, between fear
and desire about my voyage; when, as I was
musing, I could perceive that the tide was turned,
and the flood came on, upon which my going was
for so many hours impracticable. Upon this it
presently occurred to me, that I should go op to
the highest ground I could find, and observe, if I
could, how the sets of the tide or currents lay
when the flood came in, that I might judge whe-
ther, if I was- driven one way out, I might not
expect to be driven another way home, with the
same rapidness of the currents.
This thought was no sooner in my head but I
cast my eyes upon a little hill, which sufficiently
overlooked the sea both ways, and from whence I
had a clear view of the currents, or sets of the
tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my
return. Here I found that after the current of the
ebb set out close by the south point of the island,
so the current of the flood set in close by the shore
of the north side; and that I had nothing to do
but to keep to the north of the island in my return,
and 1 should do well enough.
Encouraged with this observation, I resolved
next morning to set out with the first of the tide;
and reposing myself for that night in the canoe,
under the great watch-coat I mentioned, 1 launched
out in the morning. I made first a little out to
sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the
current which set eastward, and which carried
me at a great rate, and yet did not so hurry me as
the southern side current had done before, and so
as to take from me all government of the boat;
but having a strong steerage with the paddle, I
went directly for the wreck, and in less than two
hours I came up to it
It was a dismal sight to look at; the ship, which
by the building was Spanish, stuck fast, jambed in
between two rocks, and the stern and quarter of
her was beaten to pieces with the sea; and as her
forecastle, which stuck on the rock, had run on
with great violence, her main-mast and fore-mast
were brought by the board; that is to say, broken
short off; but her bowsprit appeared sound, and
the head and bow firm. When I came cloae to her
a dog I saw upon her, who, seeing me coming, yelp-
ed and barked; and as soon as I called him, jump-
ed into the sea to come to me; and I took him
into the boat, and found him almost dead with hun-
ger and thirst. I gave him a cake of my bread,
and he eat it like a ravenous wolf that had been
starving for a fortnight in the snow. I then gave
the poor creature some fresh water, with which, if
I would have let him, he would have burst him-
self.
After this I went on board. The first sight I
met with, was two men drowned in the cook room
or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about
one another. I concluded, as is indeed probable,
that when the ship struck, it being in a storm, the
sea broke so high, and so continually over her, that
the men were notable to bearit, and were strangled
with the constant rushing in of the water, as much
as if they had been under water. Besides the dog,
there was nothing left in the ship that had life, or
any goods that I could see, but what were spoiled
by the water. There were some casks of liquor,
whether wine or brandy I knew not, which lay
lower in the hold, and which, the water being eb-
bed out, I could see, but they were too big to med-
dle with. I saw several chests, which I believed
belonged to some of the seamen, and I got two of
them into the boat, without examining what was
in them.
Had the stern of the ship been fixed, and the fore
part broken off, I am persuaded I might have mado
a good voyage; for, by what I had found in these
two chests, I had reason to suppose the ship bad a
great deal of wealth on board; and, if 1 may guess
by the course Bhe steered, she must have been bound
from Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the
south part of America, beyond the Brazils to the
Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and BO perhaps to
Spain.
1 found, besides these chests, a little cask fall of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into
my boat with difficulty. There were several mus-
kets in the cabin, and a great powder horn, with
about four pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets
I had no occasion for them, so I left them, but took
the powder horn. I took a fire shovel and tongs,
which I wanted extremely; as also two little brass
kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a
gridiron; and with this cargo and the dog, I came
away, the tide beginning to make again; and the
same evening, about an hour within night, I reached
the island, weary and fatigued to the last degree.
I reposed that night in the boat, and in the morn-
ing I resolved to harbour what I had gotten in my
new cave, not to carry it over to my castle. After
refreshing myself, I got all my cargo on shore, and
began to examine it. The casks of liquor I found
to be a kind or rum, but not such as we had at the
Brazils, and in a word, not at all good. But when
I came to open the chests, 1 found several things I
wanted; for example, I found in one a line case of
bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with
cordial waters, fine, and very good; the bottles
held about three pints each, and were tipped with
silver. I found two pots of very good succades, or
sweetmeats, so fastened at top, that the salt water
had not injured them; and two more of the same,
which the water had spoiled. I found some very
good shirts, which were very welcome to me, and,
about a dozen and a half of white handkerchiefs
and coloured neckcloths; the former were also very
welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my
face on a hot day. Besides this, when I came to
look in the chest, I found there three great, bags of
pieces of eight, which held ahout four hundred
pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a
paper, six doubloons of gold, and some bars of gold;
I suppose they might all weigh near a pound.
The other cheat I found had some clothes in it,
most of little value; but by the circumstances it
must have belonged to the gunner's mate, though
there was but about two pounds of glazed powder
in three small flasks, kept I suppose for charging
their fowling pieces on occasion. Upon the whole,
I got very little by this voyage that was of much
use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner
of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under
my feet, and I would have given it all for three or
four pairs of English shoes and stockings, which
were things I greatly wanted, for I had not had a
pair on my feet for many years. !had, indeed,
got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the
feet of the two men whom I found drowned in the
wreck: and I found two pair more in one of the
chests, which were very welcome to me; but they
were not like our English shoes, either for ease or
service, being rather what we call pumps than
Rhoes. I found in this seaman's chest about fifty
pieces of eight in royals, but no gold; I suppose
this belonged to a poorer man than the other,
which seemed to belong to an officer.
Well, however, I lugged this money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done before that
which I had brought from my own ship; but it
was a great pity, as I said, that the other part of
the ship had not come to my share, for I am satis-
fied I might have loaded my canoe several times
with money, which, if ever I had escaped to Eng-
land, would have lain here safe enough till I might
have come and fetched it.
Having now hronght all my things on shore, and
secured then1, I went hack to my boat, and rowed
or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour,
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way
to mv old habitation, where I found every thing
safe and quiet; sol began to repose myself, live
after my old fashion, and take care of my family
affairs ; and for awhile lived easy enough only that
I was more vigilant, than I used to be, looked out
oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at
any time I did stir out with any freedom, it was
always to the east part of the island, where I was
pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and
where I could go without so many precautions,
and such a load of arms and ammunition as I al-
ways carried with me, if I went the other way.
I am now to he supposed to be retired into my
castle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my fri-
gate laid up, and secured under water as usual, and
my condition restored to what I was before, but
with more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but
not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards
came thither.
It was one night in the rainy season, in March,
the four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot
in this island of solitariness, I had the following
dream: viz., that as I was going out in the morn-
ing, as usual, from my castle, I saw upon the shore
two canoes, and eleven savages coming to land,
and that they brought with them another savage,
whom they were going to kill, in order to eat him,
when, on a sudden, the savage that they were
going to kill, made his escape, and ran for his life.
And then I.thought, in my sleep, that he came run-
ning into my little grove, before my fortification,
to hide himst•li; aud that I seeing him, and not
perceiving that the other sought him that way,
showed myself to him, aud encouraged him; that
he kneeled dowa to me, seeming to pray to me to
assist him; upon which I showed my ladder, made
him go upon it, and carried him into my cave, aud
he became my servant; aud that as soon as I got
this man, I said to myself, " Now I may venture
to the main land, tor this fellow will serve me as a
pilot, and tell me what to do, and whither to go
for provisions, and whither not to go, for fear of
being devoured; what places to venture into, and
what to escape." I awoke with this thought, and
was under such inexpressible impressions of joy, at
the thought of my escape in my dream, that the
disappointment I felt upon coming to myself, and
finding that it was no more than a dream, threw
me into very great dejection of spirits.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an escape,
was to try to get a savage in my possession; aud,
if possible, it should be one of their prisoners,
whom they had condemned to be eaten, aud should
bring hither to kill; but these thoughts were still
attended with this difficulty, that it was impossible
to effect this without attacking a whole caravan of
them; and this was not only a very desperate
attempt, and might miscarry, but I had greatly
scrupled the lawfulness of it to me, and my heart
trembled at the thoughts of shedding blood, though
it was for my deliverance.
However, at last, after many disputes with my-
self, and after great perplexities about it, the eager
desire for deliverance at length mastered all the
rest, and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these
savages into my hands, cost what it would. My
next thing was to contrive how to do it: and this
indeed was very difficult to resolve on: but as I
could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I re-
solved to put myself upon the watch, to see when
they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event,
taking such measures as the opportunity should
present.
About a year and a half after I had entertained
these notions, and by long musing, had, as it were,
resolved to put them into execution, I was sur-
prised one morning early with seeing no less than
five canoes, all on shore together, ou my side of the
island, and the people who belonged to them all
landed. The number of them broke all my mea-
sures; for, seeing so many, and knowing that they
always came four, or sometimes more, in a boat, I
could not tell what to think of it, or how to take
my measures to attack twenty or thirty men single
handed. However, I put myself into all the same
postures for an attack that I had formerly provided,
and was just ready for action if anything had pre-
sented. Having waited a good while, listening to
hear if they made any noise, at length being very
impatient, I set my guns at the foot of my ladder,
and clambered up to the top of the hill by my two
stages, as usual; standing so, however, that my
head did not appear above the hill; so that they
could not perceive me by any means. I here ob-
served, by the help of my perspective glass, that
they were no less than thirty in number, that they
had a fire kindled, and that they had meat dressed;
how they cooked it, that I know not, or what it
was; but they were all dancing in I know not how
many barbarous gestures and figures, round the fire.
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived
by my perspective glass, two miserable wretches
dragged from the boats, where it seems they were
laid, and were now brought out for slaughter. I
perceived one of them immediately fall, being
knocked down, I suppose with a club, or wooden
sword, for that was their way: and two or three
others were at work, cutting him open for their
cookery, while the other victim was left standing
by himself, till they should be ready for him. In
that very moment that poor wretch seeing himself
at liberty, nature inspired him with hopes of life,
and he started away from them, and ran with in-
credible swiftness along the sand, directly towards
me, I mean towards that part of the coast where
my habitation was
I was dreadfully frighted (that I must acknow-
ledge), when I perceived him to run my way, and
especially, when, as I thought, 1 saw him pursued
by the whole body; and I expected that part of
my dream was coming to pass, and that he would
take shelter in my grove; but I could not depend,
by any means, upon my dream for the rest of it,
viz , that the savages would not pursue him thither,
and find him there. However, I kept my station,
and my spirits began to recover when I found that
he outstripped them exceedingly in running, and
gained ground of them, so that it he could but hold
out for half an hour, I saw he would fairly get
away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek
which I mentioned often at the first part of my
story, when I landed my cargoes out of the ship;
and this I knew he must necessarily swim over,
or the poor wretch would be taken there; but
when the savage who was escaping, came thither,
he made nothing of it, though the tide was then up;
but plunging in, he swam through it in about thirty
strokes, or thereabouts, landed, and ran on with
exceeding strength and swiftness. When the three
I 2
pursuers came to the creek, I found that two of
them could swim, but the third could not, and that
he standing on the other side, looked at the ethers,
but went no further, and directly after went softly
back again, which, as it happened, was very well
for him.
I observed that the two who swam were yet
twice as long swimming over the creek, than the
fellow that ivas fled from them. It came now very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irresistibly,
that now was my time to get me a servant, and
perhaps, a companion or assistant, and that I was
called plainly, by Providence, to save this poor
creature's life. I immediately got down the lad-
ders, fetched my two gnns, for they were both at
the foot of the ladders, and getting up again with
the same haste to the top of the bill, I crossed
towards the sea; and having a very short cut, and
all down hill, clapped myself in the way between
the pursuers and the pursued, hallooing aloud to
him that fled, who looking back, was at first as
much frighted at me, as at them; but I beckoned
with my hand to him to come back, and, in the
mean time, I slowly advanced towards the two
that followed; then rushing at once upon the fore-
most, knocked him down with the stock of my
piece; I was loath to fire, because I would not
have the rest to hear, though at that distance it
would not have been easily heard, and being out of
sight of the smoke, too, they would not have known
what to make of it. Having knocked this fellow
down, the other who followed him, stopped, as if
he had been frighted, and I advanced apace towards
him ; but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he
bad a bow and arrow, and was lifting it to shoot at
me; so I was then necessitated to shoot at him first
which I did, and killed him at the first shot. The
ROBINSON CRUSOE AND HIS MAN FRIDAY.
poor savage who fled, but had stopped, though he
saw both his enemies fallen, and killed, (as he
thought), yet was so frighted with the noise and
fire of my piece, that he stood stock still, and nei-
ther came forward nor went backward, though he
seemed rather inclined to lie still, than to come on.
I hallooed again to him, and made signs to him to
come forward, which be easily understood, and
came a little way farther, and stopped again; and
then he stood trembling, as if he had been taken
prisoner, and had just been to be killed, as his two
enemies were. I beckoned to him again to come
to me, and gave him all the signs of encouragement
that I could think of; and be came nearer and
nearer, kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in
token of acknowledgment for saving his life. I
smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned
to him to come still nearer. At length he came
close to me, aud then he kneeled down again, kissed
the ground, and taking my foot, set it upon his
head ; this, it seems was in token of swearing to be
my slave for ever. I took him up, and made much
ot him, and encouraged him all I could. But, I
perceived the savage whom I knocked down was
not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began
to come to himspll. So I pointed to^im, showing
him the savage, that he was not dead: upon this
he spoke some words to me, and though I could
not understand them, yet I thought they were
pleasant to hear, for they were the first sound of a
man's voice that I had heard, my own excepted,
for above five and twenty years. The savage who
was knocked down, recovered himself so far as to
sit upon the ground, and I perceived that my savage
began to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented
my other piece at the man, as if I would shoot him,
upon this my savage for so I called him now, made
a motion to me to lend him my sword, which hung
naked in a belt by my side; so 1 did. He no sooner
had it than he runs to his enemy, and, at one blow
cut off his head as cleverly, no executioner in Ger-
many could have done it sooner or better; which I
thought very strange for one who, I had reason to
believe, never saw a sword in his life before, except
their own wooden swords. However, it seems, as
I learned afterwards they make their wooden swords
so sharp, so heavy, and the wood is so hard, that
they will cut off heads and arms with them, and
that at one blow too. When he had done this, he
comes laughing to me in a sign of triumph, and
brought me the sword again and laid it down with
the head of the savage he had killed just before me.
He was astonished how I had killed the other In-
dian so far off; and, going to him, he stood like
one amazed, looking at him, turning him first on
one side, then on the other; looking at the wound
the bullet had made, which was in the breast,
where it had made a hole, and no great quantity
of blood had followed, but he had bled inwardly,
for he was quite dead. Then he took up his bow
and arrows, and came back, and I beckoned for ns
to go away, making signs that more might come
after them. Upon this he signed to me, that he
would bury them with sand, that they might not
be seen, by the rest, if they followed; so I made
signs for him to do so; he fell to work, and had
them both buried in the sand in about a quarter oj
an hour. I then called him away, and took him
not to my castle, but my cave, on the farther part
of the island; so I did not let my dream come to
pass, in that respect, viz., that he came into my
grove for shelter. Here I gave him bread, and a
bunch of raisins to eat, and a draught of water,
which he stood in great distress for, by bis run-
ning; and having refreshed him, I made signs for
him to go to sleep, pointing to a place where I had
laid a great parcel of rice-straw, and a blanket
upon it, where I used to sleep upon myself some-
times; so the poor creature lay down, and went to
sleep.
He was a comely handsome fellow, perfectly well
made, with straight long limbs, not too large, tall,
and well-shaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-
six years of age. He bad a very good countenance,
not a fierce and surly aspect, but seemed to have
something very manly in his face, and yet he had
all the sweetness and softness of an European in
his countenance too, especially when he smiled:
his hair was long and black, not curled like wool;
his forehead very high and large, and a great viva-
city and sparkling sharpness in his eyes. The co-
lour of his skin was not quite black, but very
tawny, and yet not of an ngly yellow nauseous
tawny, as the Brazilians and Virginians, and other
natives of America are, but of a bright kind of a
dun olive colour, that had in it something very
agreeable, though not very easy to describe. His
face was round and plump, his nose small, but not
flat like the negros, a very good mouth, thin lips,
and his teeth fine, well set, and white as ivory.
After he had slumbered, rather than slept, about
half an hour, he waked again, and comes out of the
cave to me, for I had been milking my goats,
which I had in the enclosure just by: when he
spied me, he came running to me, laying himself
down again upon the ground, with all possible
signs of a humble thankful disposition, making
many antic gestures to show it. At last he lays
his head flat on the ground, close to my foot, and
set my other foot upon his head, as he had done
before; and after this, made all the signs to me of
servitude, and submission imaginable, to let me
know he would serve me as long as he lived. I
understood him in many things, and let him know
I was very well pleased with him. In a little
time I began to speak to him, and teach him to
speak to me; and first, I made him know bis name
should be Fridny, which was the day I saved his
life; and I called him so for the memory of the
time; I likewise taught him to say ' Master,"
and then let him know that was to be my name; I
likewise taught him to say "Yes" and " No," and
to know the meaning of them. I gave him some
milk in an earthen pot, and let him see me drink
it before him, and sop my bread in it; and I gave
him a cake of bread to do the like, which he
quickly complied with, and made signs that it was.
very good.
I kept there with him all that night; but as soon
as it was day, I beckoned him to come with me,
and let him know I would give him some clothes;
at which he seemed very glad, for he was stark-
naked. As he went by the place where he had
buried the two men, he pointed out exactly the
spot, and showed me the marks that he bad made
to find them again, making signs to me that he
should dig them np again, and eat them: at this
I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence
of it, made as if I would vomit at the thoughts of
it, and beckoned with my hand to him to come
away, which he did immediately, with great sub-
mission.
After I had been two or three days returned to
my castle, I thought, that in order to bring Friday
off from this horrid way of feeding, and from the
relish of a cannibal's stomach, I ought to let him
taste other flesh. So I took him out with me one
morning to the woods, and I saw a she-goat lying
down in the shade, and two young kids close by
her. I catched hold of Friday; <:Hold," said I,
"staud still;" and made signs to him not to stir;
immediately I presented my piece, shot, and killed
one of the kids. The poor creature who had, at a
distance indeed, seen me kill the savage, bis enemy,
but did not know, nor could imagine, how it was
done, was sensibly surprised, trembled, and shook,
and looked so amazed, that I thought he would
have sunk down. He did not see the kid I had
shot at, nor perceive I had killed it, but ripped up
his waistcoat to feel if be had not been wounded;
and as I supposed thought I was resolved to kill
him; for he came and kneeled down to me, and
embracing my knees, said a great many things I
did not understand, but I could see that his mean-
jug was to pray to me not to kill him.
I soon found a way to convince him that I would
do him no harm; and, taking him by the hand,
laughed at him, and, pointing to the kid I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it which
he did; I loaded my gun again, and by-and-bye I
saw a great fowl, like a hawk, sit upon a tree
within shot; so, to let Friday understand a little
what I would do, I called him to me again, and
pointing to the fowl, which was a parrot, (though
I thought it had been a hawk,) and to my gun,
and to the ground under the parrot to let him see
I would make him fall, I made him understand
that I would shoot and kill that bird; accordingly
I fired, and bade him look, and immediately he saw
the parrot fall. He stood like one frightened again,
notwithstanding all I had said to him; and found
be was the more amazed, because he did not see
me put anything into the gun: and I believe, if 1
would have let him, he would have worshipped me
and my gun; as for the gun itself, he would not so
much as touch it for several days after, but would
speak to it, ami talk to it, as if it had answered
him, which, as I afterwards learned of him, was to
desire it not to kill him.
The next day I set him to work to beating some
corn out, and sifting it in the manner I used to do;
as he understood how to do it as well as I, espe-
cially after he had seen what the meaning of it
was, and that it was to make bread of; for after I
had let him see me make my bread, and bake it
too; in a little time Friday was able to do all as
well as myself.
I began now to consider that having two mouths
to feed instead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn
than I used to do; so I marked out a larger piece
of land, and began to fence it in the same manner
as before, in which Friday not only worked very
hard, but very cheerfully; and I told him that it was
for corn to make bread, because he was now with
me, and that we might have enough for us both.
This was the pleasantest year I had led in this
place. Friday began to talk very well, and besides
the pleasure of talking to him, I bad singular satis-
faction in the fellow himself; his simple nnfeigned
honesty appeared to me more and more every day,
and I really begau to love the creature; and I believe
he loved me as much as possible.
After Friday and 1 became more intimately ac-
quainted, and he could understand almost all I said
to him, and speak fluently, though in broken English,
I acquainted him with my history. I let bim into
the mistery of gunpowder and bullets, and also
taught him how to shoot. I gave him a knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with; and I
made him a belt with a frog hanging to it, such as
in England we wear hangers in; and in the frog,
instead of the hanger, I gave him a hatchet.
I described to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worshipped God, how we behaved
to one another, and how we traded in ships to all
parts of the world. I gave him an account of the
wreck which I had been on board of, and showed
him, as near as I could, the place where she lay;
but she had all gone long ago.
I showed him the ruins of our boat, which we
lost when I escaped, and which had now fallen
almost to pieces. Upon seeing this boat, Friday
stood musing some time, and said nothing. I asked
him what he studied upon, says he, "Me see such
boat this like come to place at my nation."
I did not understand him a little while ; but at
last, when I bad examined further into it, I under-
stood by him, that a boat, such as that had been,
came on shore upon the country where he lived;
that is, as he explained it, was driven thither by
stress of weather. 1 presently imagined that some
European ship must have been cast away upon
their coast, and the boat might get loose, and
drive ashore, but I was so dull that 1 never once
thought of men making their escape from a wreck
thither, much less whence they might come, so I
only enquired after a description of the boat.
Friday described the boat to me well enough;
but brought me better to understand him when he
added, with some warmth,—" We save the white
mans from drown." Then I presently asked him
if there were many white mans, as he called them,
in the boat. He said, that the boat was full of
white mans. I asked him how many? He told
me, npon his fingers, seventeen. I then asked him
what became of them, when he said,—" They live,
they dwell at my nation."
This put new thoughts into my head again, for
I presently imagined that these might be the men
belonging to the ship that were cast away in sight
of my island, and who, after the ship had struck
on the rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had
saved themselves in their boats, and were landed
upon that wild shore among the savages.
Upon this, I enquired of him more critically,
what was become of them. He assured me they
still lived there—that they had been there about
four years—that the savages let them alone, and
gave them victuals to live upon. I asked him how
it came to pass that they did not kill them and eat
them. He said, "No; they make brother with
them. They no eat mans, hut make the war
fight." That is to say, they never eat any men,
but such as come to fight with them, and are taken
in battle.
It was after this, some considerable time, that
being on the top of the hill, at the east side of the
island, from whence I had in a clear day discovered
the main, or continent of America, Friday, the
weather being very serene, looks very earnestly
towards the main land, and in a kind of surprise,
falls a jumping and dancing, and calls out to me.
I asked him what was the matter. "Oh, joy ."says
he, " Oh, glad! There see my country! there my
nation."
I observed an extraordinary spnse of pleasure ap-
peared in his face, his eyes sparkled, and his coun-
tenance discovered a strange pageruess, as if he had
a mind to be in his own country again; and this
observation of mine put a great many thoughts into
me, which made me at first not so easy about my
new man Friday as I was before; and I made no
doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his
own nation again, he would not only forget all his
religion, but all his obligation to me.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very
much, which I was very sorry for afterwards;
however, as my jealousy increased, and held me
some weeks, I was a little more circumspect, and
not so familiar and kind to him as before, in which
I was certainly in the wrong.
Whilst my jealousy of him lasted, I was every
day pumping him to see if he would discover any
of the new thoughts which I suspected were in
him; but I found everything he said was honest,
and so innocent, that I could find nothing to nourish
my suspicion, and, in spite of all my uneasiness, he
made me at last entirely his own again, nor did he
iu the least perceive that I was uneasy, and there-
fore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the same hill, the weather
being hazy at sea, so that we could not see the con-
tinent, I called to him, and said, "Friday, do you
not wish yourself in your own country, your own
nation?" "Yes," he said, " I be much glad to be
at my own nation."—" What would you do there ?''
said I, "would you turn wild again, eat man's
flesh again, and be as savage as you were before?"
He looked full of concern, and shaking his head,
said, "No.no; Friday tell them to live good; tell
tell them to pray to God; tell them to eat corn
bread, cattle, flesh, milk; no eat man again."—
"Why, then," said I to him, "they will kill you."
He looked grave at that, and then said, "No, they
no kill me; they willing love learn." He meant
by this, they would be willing to learn; and addt-d,
they learned much of the bearded mans that cann;
in the boat. . Theu I asked him if he would go
back to them. He smiled at that, and told me he
could not swim so far. I told him I would make a
canoe lor him. He told me that he would go if I
would go with him. "I go," said I, "why, they
will eat me if I come there."—" No, no," said he,
"me make them no eat you: me make them they
much love you." He meant that he would tell them
how I had killed his enemies, and saved his life,
and so would make them much love me.
From this time, I confess I had a mind to ven-
ture over, and see if I could possihly join with
these bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were
Spaniards or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I
could, we might find some method to escape from
thence, being upon the continent, and a good com-
pany together, better than I could upon an island,
forty miles off the shore, and alone without help.
So, after some days, I took Friday to work again,
and by way of discourse, I said, I would give him
a boat to go back to his own nation; and accord-
ingly carried him to my frigate, which lay on the
other side of the island, and having cleared it of
the water, I brought it out, and showed it to him,
and we both went into it.
I found he was very dexterous at managing it,
and would make it go almost as swift again as I
could, so I said to him, "Well, now, Friday,shall
we go to your nation?" He looked very dull at
my saying so, which it seems, was because he
thought the boat was too small to go so far. I told
him that I had a bigger; so, the next day I went
to the place where my first boat lay, which I had
made, but which I could not get into the water.
He said that it was big enough; but asl had taken
no care of it, and it had lain two or three-and-
twenty years there, the sun had so split and dried
it, that it was in a manner rotten. .Friday told me
that such a boat would do very well, and would
carry " mnch enough vittle, drink, bread ;" that was
his way of talking.
I found that all the foundation of his desire to
go to his own country was laid in his ardent affec-
tion to the people, and his hopes of my doing them
good: a thing which, as I had no notion of myself,
so I had not the least thought or intention, or de-
sire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong
inclination to attempt an escape, founded on the
supposition gathered from the former discourse,
viz., that there were seventeen bearded men there;
and therefore, without any more delay, I went to
work with Friday, to find a great tree proper to
fell, and make a large periagua, or canoe, for the
voyage. After searching some time, Friday at last
pitched upon a tree, for I found he knew much
better than I did what kind of wood was fittest
for it; nor can I tell to this day, what kind of wood
to call the tree which we cut down, except it was
very like the tree which we call fustic, or be-
tween that and the Nicaragua wood, for it was
much of the same colour and smell. Friday was
for burning the hollow or cavity of this tree out, to
make it into a boat, but I showed him how rather
to cut it out better with tools, which, after I showed
him how to use, he did it very handily, and in about
a month's hard labour we finished it, and made it
very handsome, especially when, with our axes,
which I showed him how to handle, we cut and
hewed the outside into the true shape of a boat.
After this, however, it cost us near upon a fortnight's
time to get her along, as it were, inch by inch,upon
great rollers, into the water, but when she was in,
she would have carried twenty meu with ease.
It amazed me to see with what dexterity, and
how swift my man Friday could manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along. So I asked him if he
would, and if we might venture over in her. "Yes,"
said he, "me venture over in her very well, though
blow great wind." However, I had a farther de-
sign that he knew nothing of, and that was to make
a mast and sail, and to fit her with an anchor and
cable. As to a mast, that was easy enough to get,
so I pitched upon a straight young cedar tree,
which I found near the place, and which there was
plenty of in the island: and I set Friday to work
to cut it down, and gave him directions how to
shape and order it; but as to the sail, that was my
particular care. I knew I had pieces of old sails, but
as I had had them now twenty-six years by me,
and not being very careful to preserve them, they
were nearly all rotten. However, I found two
pieces which appeared to be pretty good, and with
a good deal of pains, and awkward tedious stretch-
ing, for want of needles, I at length made a three-
corned, ugly thing, like what we call, in England, a
shoulder of mutton sail, to go with a boom at the
bottom, and a little short sprit sail at the top, such
as our ships' long-boats usually sail with, and such
as I best knew how to manage, because it was such
a one as I used in the boat in which I made my
escape from Barbary.
I was near two months in rigging and fitting out
my mast and sails, for I fitted them very complete,
making a small stay, and a sail or foresail to it, to
assist, if we should turn to windward, and which
was more than all, I fixed a rudder to the stern of
her to steer with, and though I was but a bungling
shipwright, yet as I knew the usefulness and even
necessity of such a thing, 1 applied myself with so
much pains to do it, that at last I brought it to
pass. •
I was now entered on my twenty-seventh year
of my captivity in this place; though the three last
years that I had this creature with me ought rather
to be left out of the account, my habitation being
quite of another kind, than in all the rest of the
time. I kept the anniversary of my landing here
with the same thankfulness to God, for His mercies
as at first; and if I had such acknowledgment at
first, I had much more now, having such additional
testimonies of the care of Providence over me, and
the great hopes I had of being effectually and
speedily delivered; for I had an invincible impres-
sion upon my thoughts, that my deliverance was
at hand, and that I should not be another year in
this place. However, I went on with my work as
usual.
When the settled season began to come in, the
first thug I did was to lay by a certain quantity
of provisions, being the stores of our voyage; and
I intended in a week or fortnight's time to launch
our boat. I was busy one morning on something
of this kind, when I called to Friday, and bade
him go to the sea-shore, and see if he could find a
turtle or tortoise, a thing which we generally got
once a week, for the sake of the eggs as well as
the flesh.
Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall or
fence, like one that felt not the ground ; and before
I had time to speak to him, he cried out to me,—
"Oh, master! Oh, master! Oh, sorrow! Oh,
bad!"—" What's the matter, Friday?" said I.—
"Oh, yonder, there," says he, "one, two, three
canoe; one, two, three!"—I said, "Friday, we
must resolve to right them. Can you fight, Fri-
day ?"—" Me shoot," says he, "but here come
much great number."—" No matter for that, Fri-
day," said I again. So I asked him whether, if I
resolved to defend him, he would defend me, and
K

stand by me, and do jnst as I bade him. He said,
—" Me die when you bid die, massa!"—So I gave
him the two fowling pieces, loaded with swan-
shot, as big as small pistol-bullets; then I took
four muskets, and loaded them with two sings and
five small bullets, each; and my two pistols I
loaded with a brace of bullets each. I hung my
great sword, as usual, naked by my side, and gave
Friday his hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myself, I took my
perspective glass, and went up to the side of the
hill to see what I could discover, and I found by
my glass that there were twenty-one savages,
three prisoners, and tnree canoes; and that their
whole business seemed to be the banquet upon
three human bodies; bnt nothing more than as I
had observed was usual with them.
They were landed, not where they had done
when Friday made his escape, but nearer to my
creek, where the shore was low, and where a thick
•wood came close almost down to the sea. This,
with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand these
wretches came about, so filled me with indigna-
tion, that I came down to Friday, and told him 1
was resolved to go down to them and kill them
all, and asked him if he would stand by me. He
had now got over his fright, and his spirits being
raised with the dram I had given him, he was
cheerful and told me as before, "he would die
when I bid die."
In this fit of fury, I first took and divided the
arms which I had charged as before, between us;
I gave Friday one pistol to stick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder; and I took one pistol
and the other three myself; and in this posture
we marched out. I took a small bottle of rum in
my pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more

powder and bullets; and as to the orders, I
charged him to keep close behind me, and not to
stir, or shoot, or do any thing till I bade him; and
in the mean time, not to speak a word. In this
posture I fetched a compass to my right hand of
near a mile, as well to get over the creek as to get
into the wood, so that I might come within shot
of thera before I should be discovered, which I had
seen by my glass it was easy to do.
I entered the wood with all possible wariness
and silence, (Friday following close at my heels,)
and marched till I came to the skirt of the wood,
on the side which was next to them; only that
one corner of the wood lay between me and them.
Here I called softly to Friday, and showing him a
great tree, which was just at the corner of the
wood, 1 bade him go to the tree, and bring me word
if he could see there plainly what they were doing.
He did so, and came immediately back to me, and
told me they might be plainly viewed there; that
they were all aboat the fire, eating the flesh of one
of their prisoners; and that another lay bound
upon the sand, a little from them, whom, he said,
they would kill next, and which fired th^ very soul
within me. He told me it was not one of their
nation, but one of the bearded men whom he had
told me of, that came to their country in the boat.
I was filled with horror at the very naming of the
white, bearded man, and, going to the tree, I saw
plainly by my glass a white man, who lay upon
the beach of the sea, with his hands and feet tied
with flags, or things like rushes, and that he was
a European and had clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket be-
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the
place where I was, which, by going a little way
about, I saw I might come at undiscovered, and
K 2
HO then I should be within half a shot at them. So
I withheld my passion, and, going back about
twenty paces, I got behind some bushes, which
held all the way till I came to the other tree, and
then I came to a little rising ground, which gave
me a full view of them, at the distance of about
eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lose; for nineteen
ot the dreadful wretches sat upon the ground, all
close huddled together, and had just sent the other
two to butcher the poor Christian, and bring him,
perhaps, limb by limb, to their fire; and they were
stooping down to untie the bands at his feet. I
turned to Friday; "Now, Friday," said I, " do as
I bid thee." Friday said he would. "Then, Fri-
day," said I, "do exactly as you aee me do! fail
in nothing." So I set down one of the muskets
and the fowling-piece upon the ground, and Friday
did the like by his; and with my other musket I
took ray aim at the savages, bidding him do the
like; then asking him if he was ready, he said,
"Yes "—" Then fire at them," said I; aud at the
same moment I fired also.
Friday took his aim so much better than I, that
on the side he shot he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and, on my side I killed one,
and wounded two. They were in a dreadful con-
sternation; and all them, who were not hurt,
jumped up upon their feet immediately, but did not
know which way to ran, or which way to look;
for they knew not from whence their destruction
came. Friday kept his eyes close upon me, that,
as I bid him, he might observe what I did: so, as
soon as the first shot was made, I threw down the
piece and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday
did the like; he sees me cock and present: he did
the same again. "Are you ready, Friday?" said
I. "Yes," said he. "Let fly, then," said I, "iu
the name of God!" and with that I fired again
among the amazed wretches, and so did Friday;
and as our pieces were now loaded with what I
call swan-shot, or small pistol bullets, we found
only two drop; but so many were wounded, that
they ran about yelling and screaming like mad
creatures, most of them all bloody and wounded;
and three more fell quickly after, but not quite
dead.
"Now, Friday," said I, laying down the dis-
charged pieces, and taking up the musket, which
was yet loaded, "follow me," which he did with
a deal of courage; upon which I rushed out of the
wood and showed myself, and Friday close at my
foot. As soon as I perceived they saw me, I
shouted as loud as I could, and bade Friday do so
too; and running as fast as I could, which, by the
way, was not very fast, I made directly towards
the poor victim, who was, as I said, lying on the
beach or shore, between the place where they sat
and the shore. The two butchers who were just
going to work with him, had left him at the sur-
prise of our first fire, and fled, in a terrible fright,
to the seaside, and had jumped into a canoe, and
three more of the rest made the same way. I
turned to Friday, and bade him step forward and
fire at them: he understood me immediately, and
running about forty yards to be nearer them, he
shot at them, and I thought he had killed them all,
for I saw them all fall in a heap in the boat, though
I saw two of them get up again quickly; however,
he killed two of them, and wounded the third, so
that he lay in the boat as if he had been dead.
While Friday fired at them, I pulled out my
knife and cut the flags that bound the poor victim;
and loosing his hands and feet, I lifted him op, and
asked him, in the Portuguese tongue, what he was.
He answered in Latin, "Christianus;" but was
bo weak and faint, he could scarce stand or
speak. I took my bottle out of my pocket and
gave it him, making signs that he should drink,
which he did; and t gave him a piece of bread,
which he ate. Then I asked him what country-
man he was, and he said, "Espagnole;" and, be-
ing a little recovered, let me know, by all the signs
he could possibly make, how much be was in my
debt for his deliverance. I said, in as good Spa-
nish as I could, " We will talk afterwards, but we
must fight now; if you have any strength left,
take the pistol and sword and lay about you." He
took them very thankfully, and no sooner had he
the arms in bis hands, but, as if they put new vi-
gour into him, he flew upon his murderers like a
fury, and cut two of them in pieces in an instant;
for they were so surprised and frightened, that they
coald make no resistance, nor attempt to escape.
I kept my piece in my hand, without firing, being
willing to keep my charge ready, because I had
given the Spaniard my pistol and sword; so I called
to Friday, and bade him ran np to the tree from
whence we fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there that had been discharged, which he quickly
did; and then giving him my musket, I sat down
to load all the rest again. While I was loading
these pieces, there happened a fierce engagement
between the Spaniard and one of the savages, who
made at him with one of their great wooden swords,
the same weapon that was to have killed him be-
fore, if I had not prevented it. The Spaniard, who
was very bold, though weak, had fought the Indian
a good while, and had cut him two great wounds
on bis head; but the savage being a stout, lusty
fellow, closing in with him, had thrown him down,
and was wringing my sword out of his hand, when
the Spaniard, though undermost, wisely quitted
the sword, drew the pistol from his girdle, and
shot him dead on the spot.
Friday, being now left at liberty, pursued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but
his hatchet; and with that he despatched those
three who were wounded at first and fallen, and
all the rest, he could come up with; and the
Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one
of the fowling pieces, with which he pursued two
of the savages, and wounded them both: but as he
was not able to run, they got from him into the
woods, where Friday pursued them, and killed one
of them; and though he was wounded, yet had
plunged into the sea, and swam with all his might
off to the others who were left in the canoe, which
were all that escaped out of one-and-twenty.
Those that were in the canoe worked hard to
get out of gua-shot: and though Friday made two
or three shots at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them.
Friday would fain have had me take one of their
canoes and pursue them, and indeed I was very
anxious about their escape, least, carrying the
news home to their people, they should come back,
parhaps with two or three hundred of their canoes,
and devour us by mere multitude: so I consented
to pursue them by sea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me;
but when I was in the canoe, I was surprised to
find another poor creature in there alive, bound
hand and foot, as the Spaniard was, for slaughter,
and almost dead with fear.
I immediately cut the twisted flags, or rushes,
that bound him, and would have helped him up;
but he could not stand or speak, but groaned most
piteously, believing, it seems, still, that he was
only unbound in order to be killed. When Friday
came I bade him speak to him, and tell him of his.
deliverance; and pulling out my bottle made him
give the poor creature a dram, which, with the
news of his being delivered, revived him, and he sat
up in the boat; but when Friday came to hear him
speak, and looked in his face, it would have moved
any one to tears to have seen how Friday kissed
him, hugged him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped
about, danced, sung, then cried again, wrung bis
hands, beat his own face and head, and then sung
and jumped about again, like a distracted creature.
It was a good while before I could make him speak
to me, or tell me what was the matter; but when
he came a little to himself, he said that it was bis
father.
It is not easy forme to express how it moved me
to see what ecstacy and filial affection had worked
in this poor savage, at the sight of his father, and
of his being delivered from death; nor indeed can I
describe half the extravagance of his affection after
this, for he went in and ont of the boat, a great
many times. When he went to him, he would sit
down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's
head to his bosom half an hour togethei, to nourish
it; then he took his arms and ancles which were be-
numbed and stiff with the binding, and chafed and
robbed them with his bands; and I perceiving what
the case was, gave him some rum ont of my bottle
to rub them with, which did them a great deal of
good.
This action pat an end to our pursuit of the canoe
with the other savages, who were now got almost
ont of sight; and it was happy for us we did not;
for it blew so hard within two hours after, from the
north-west, which was against them, that I conld

not suppose their boat would live, or that they ever
reached their own coast.
But to return to Friday, he was so busy about
his father, that I could not find in my heart to take
him off for some time; but after I thought he could
leave him a little, 1 called him to me, and he came
jumping and laughing, pleased to the highest ex-
treme. Then I asked him if he had given his
father my bread. He shook bis head, and said,
"None; the ugly dog eat all up self." So I gave
him a cake of bread out of a little pouch I carried
on purpose ; I also gave him a dram for himself, but
he would not taste it, but carried it to his father. T
had in my pocket also two or three bunches of raisins,
so I gave him a handful of them for his father.
He had no sooner given his father these raisins,
but I saw him come out of the boat, and run away,
as if he had beeu bewitched. He ran at such a rate,
(for he was the swiltest fellow of foot that ever I
saw,) I say, he ran at such a rate, that he was out
of sight, as it were in an instant; and although I
called and hallooed after him, it was all one; away
he went, and in a quarter of an hour I saw him
come back again though not so fast as he went;
and as he came nearer I found his pace was slacker,
hecause he had something in his hand.
When he came to me, I found he had been quite
home tor an earthern jug, or pot, to bring his father
some fresh water, and that he had got two more
cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave me,
but the water be carried to his father; however, as
I was very thirsty, I took a little sup of it. The
water revived his father more than all the rum or
spirits I had given him, for he was just fainting
with thirst.
When his father had drunk, I called to him to
know if there was any water left; he said," Yes,"
and I bade him give it to the Spaniard, who was
as much in want of it as bis father, and I sent one
of the cakes that Friday brought, to the Spaniard
too, who was indeed very weak, and was reposing
himself upon a green place, under the shade of a
tree, and whose limbs were also very stiff, and very
much swelled with the rude bandage he had been
tied with. When I saw that upon Friday's coming
up to him with the water, he sat op and drank,
and took the bread and began to eat, I went up to
him and gave him a handful of raisins. He looked
np in my face with all the tokens of gratitude and
thankfulness that could appear in any countenance;
but so weak, notwithstanding be had so exerted
himself in the fight, that he could not stand upon
his feet; he tried to do it two or three times, but
really was not able, his anclps were so swelled, and
so painful to him; so I bid him sit still, and caused
Friday to bathe them with rum, as he had done his
father's.
I observed the poor affectionate creature, every
two minutes, or perhaps less, all the while he was
here, turned his head about to see for his father, and
at last he missed him, at which he started up, and
without speaking a word, flew with snch swiftness
to him, that no one could scarce perceive his feet to
touch the gronnd as he went; but when he came,
he found he had only laid himself down to ease his
limbs. So Friday came back to me presently, and
I then told him to help the Spaniard to the boat;
so he took him upon his back, and stepping out
again, launched the boat off, and paddled it along
the shore faster than I could walk, though the wind
blew pretty hard too ; so he brought them both safe
into our creek: and leaving them in the boat, runs
away to fetch another canoe. As he passed me, T
spoke to him and asked him whither he went. He
told me, "Go fetch more boat." So away he went,
like the wind: for sure never man or horse went
like him: and he had the other canoe in the creek
almost as soon as I got to it by land; so he wafted
me over, and then went to help our new guests out
of the boat, which he did; but they were neither of
them able to walk, so that poor Friday knew not
what to do.
At last, we made a kind of hand-barrow to lay
them on, and Friday and I carried them up both
together upon it between us. But when we got
them to the outside of our wall or fortification, we
were at a worse loss than before, for it was impos-
sible to get them over; and I was resolved not to
break it down. So I set to work again; and Fri-
day and I, in about two hours' time, made a very
handsome tent, covered with old sails, and above
that with boughs of trees, being in the space with-
out our outward fence, and between that and the
grove of young wood which I had planted; and
here we made them two beds of such things as I
had, viz., of rice straw, with blankets laid upon it
to lie on, and another to cover them on each bed.
Having now society enough, and our number
being sufficient to put us out of fear of savages, if
they had come, unless their number had been very
great, we went freely all over the island, wherever
we found occasion; and as we had our escape and
deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible,
at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.
To this purpose, I marked out seven trees which I
thought fit for our work, and I sent Friday and hia
father to cut them down; and then I caused the
Spaniard to oversee and direct their work. I show-
ed them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed
a large tree into single planks, and I caused them
to do the like, till they had made about a dozen
L
large planks of good oak, near two feet broad,
thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four
inches thick. What prodigious labour it took up
any one may imagine. -
It was now harvest, and our crop in good or-
der. It was not the most plentiful increase I
had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough
to answer our end, for from our twenty-two bushels
of barley, we brought in and thrashed out above
two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in
proportion of the rice, which was store enough for
our food to the next harvest, though all the fourteen
Spaniards had been on shore with me; or if we
had been ready for a voyage, it would very plen-
tifully have victualled our ship to have carried ns
to any part of the world, that is to say of America.
When we had thus housed and secured our maga-
zine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-
work, viz., great baskets in which we kept it;
and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this.
And now having a full supply of food for all the
guests I expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go
over to the main, to see what he could do with
those he had left behind him there. I gave him
strict charge not to bring any man with him, who
would not first swear, in the presence of himself
and the old savage, that he would in no way injure,
fight with, or attack the person he should find in
the island, who was so kind as to send for them,
in order to their deliverance; but that they would
stand by and defend him against all such attempts,
and whatever they wanted, would be entirely un-
der, and subject to his command: and that this
should be put in writing, aud signed with their
hands.
Under these instruction*, the Spaniard, and the
old savage went away in one of the canoes which
they came in, when they were brought as prisoners
to be devoured by the savages. I gave each of
them a musket, and about eight charges of powder
and ball, charging them to be very careful of both,
and not to use either of them but upon very urgent
occasions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first mea-
sure used by me in view of my deliverance, for
near twenty-seven years and some days. I gave
them provisions of bread, and of dried grapes suf-
ficient for themselves for many days, aud sufficient
for all their countrymen for about eight days; and
wishing them a good voyaije, I let them go, agree-
ing with them about a signal they should hang
out at their return, by which I should know them
again, when they came back, at a distance, before
they came on shore.
They went away with a fair gale, on the day
that the moon was at the full, by my account, in
the month of October, as near as I could tell.
It was no less than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange und unforeseen occurrence inter-
vened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in history. I was fast asleep in my hut
one morning, when my man Friday came running
to me, and cried aloud, "Master, master, they
are come, they come!" I jumped up, and regard-
lean of danger, went out, as soon as I could get
my clothes on, through my little grove; I went
without my arms, which it was not my custom to
do; but I was surprised, when turning my eyes
to the sea, I presently saw a boat, at about a
league and a half distance, standing in for the
shorp, with a shoulder of mutton sail, as they call
it, and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them
in. Also I observed, that they did not come from
that side which the shore lay on, but from the
southernmost end of the island. Upon this, I
called Friday in, and bade him lie close, for these
were not the people we looked for, and that we
did not know whether they were friends or ene-
mies. In the next place, I went in to fetch my
perspective glass, to see what I could make of
them: and having taken the ladder out, I climbed
up to the top of the hill, as I used to do, when I
was apprehensive of anything, and to take my
review plainer, without being discovered. I had
scarce set my foot on the bill, when my eye plainly
discovered a ship lying at anchor, at about two
leagues and a half from me, S. S. E , but not above
a league and a half from the shore. It appeared
plainly to be an English ship, and the boat an Eng-
lish long boat.
I had not kept myself long in this position when
I saw the boat draw near the shore, as if they
looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the conveni-
ence of landing; however as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not see the little inlet
where I formerly landed my rafts, but run their
boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile
from me, which was very happy for me; for,
otherwise they would have landed just, as I may
say, at my door, and would soon have beaten me
out of my castle, and, perhaps, have plundered me
of all I had.
When they were on the shore, I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least, most of them, one
or two I thought were Dutch, but it did not prove
so. There were in all eleven men, whereof three I
found were unarmed, and, (as I thought) bound;
and when the first four or five of them were jump-
ed on shore, they took those three out of the boat
as prisoners. One of the three I could perceive
asing the most passionate gestures of entreaty, af-
fliction, and despair; the other two lifted up their
bands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed,
but not so much as the first.
I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and
knew not what the meaning of it should be. Fri-
day called out to me, in English, as well as he
could, "Oh, master, eat mans."—" Why," said I,
"do you think they are going to eat them then?"
—" Yes," says Friday, "they will eat them."
"No no," says I, "Friday, I am afraid they will
murder them indeed, but you may be sure they will
not eat them."
All this time I had no thoughts of what the mat-
ter really was, but expected every moment the
three prisoners would be killed; and once I saw
one of the villains lift up his arm with a great cut-
lass or sword, to strike one of the poor men, and
I expected to see him fall every moment. I wish-
ed heartily now for my Spaniard, and the savage
that was gone with him; or that I had any way to
have come undiscovered within shot of them, that
I might have secured the three men, for they had no
fire-arms that I saw.
After I had observed the ontrageons usage of the
three men, by the insolent seamen, I saw that the
fellows ran scattering about the land as if they
wanted to see the country. I observed also, that
the three other men had liberty to go where they
pleased, but they sat down all three upon the ground
very pensive, and looked like men in despair.
It was just at the top of high water when
these people came on shore, and while partly they
stood parleying with the prisoners they brought,
and partly while they rambled about to see what
kind of a place they were in, they had carelessly
stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was
ebbed considerably away, leaving the boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who as I found
afterwards, having drank a little too much brandy,
fell asleep.
However, one of them waking sooner than the
other, and finding the boat too fast aground for
him to stir it, hallooed for the rest, who were
straggling about, upon which they all came to the
boat, but it was past all their strength to launch
her, the boat being very heavy, and the shores on
that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like quick-
sand. In this condition, like true seamen, who
are perhaps, the least of all mankind given to fore-
thought, they gave it over, and away they strolled
about the country again: and I heard one of them
say aloud to another, (calling them off from the
boat,) "Why, let her alone, Jack, can't ye! She'll
float next tide." By which I was fully confirmed
what countrymen they were.
All this time I kept myself close, not once daring
to stir out of my castle, any farther than to my
place of observation, near the top of the hill. I
knew it would not be less than ten hours before
the boat could be afloat again, and by that time it
would be dark, and I might be more at liberty to
nee their motions, and to hear their conversation if
they had any.
In the mean time, I fitted myself up for battle,
as before, though with more caation, knowing I
had to do with another kind of enemy than I had
at first. I ordered Friday also to load himself with
arms. I took myself two fowling pieces, and I
gave him three muskets. My figure, indeed, was
very fierce; I had my formidable goat skin coat,
with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword
by my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon
each of my shoulders.
It was my design, as 1 said above, not to have
made any attempt until it was dark; but about
two o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found they
were all gone straggling to the woods, and, as I
thought they were all laid down to sleep. The
three poor distressed men, too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, were, however, sat
down under the shelter of a great tree, at about a
quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out of
eight of any of the rest.
Upon this I resolved to discover myself to them,
and learn something of their condition. Immedi-
ately I marched with my man Friday at a good
distance behind me, as formidable for his arms as
I, but not making so staring-like a figure as I did.
I came near them as undiscovered as I could, and
then, before any of them saw me, I called aloud to
them in Spanish, "What are ye, gentlemen?"
They started up at the noise, but were ten times
more confounded when they saw me, and the un-
couth figure I made. They made no answer at all,
but I thought I perceived them just going to fly
from me, when I spoke to them in English:—
"Gentlemen," said I, "do not be surprised at me;
perhaps you may have a friend near you, when you
did not expect it."
"He must be sent directly from heaven, then,"
said one of them very gravely to me, and pulling off
his hat at the same time, "for our condition is past
the help of man."
"All help is from heaven, sir," said I, "but you
can put a stranger in the way to help yon, for yon
seem to be in some great distress. I saw you when
you landed; and when you seemed to make appli-
cation to the brutes that came with you, 1 saw one
lift up bin sword to kill you."
The poor man, with tear* running down his face
and trembling, looked like one astonished, returned,
"Am I talking to God or man? Is it a real mau,
or an angel?"
"Be in no fear about that, sir," said I; "if God
bad sent an angel to relieve you, he would have
come better clothed, and armed after another man-
ner, than you see me. Pray lay aside your fears,
I am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist
you, you see. I have one servant only; we have
arms and ammunition. Tell ns freely, can we
serve yon P What is your case?"
"Our story, sir," said he, "is too long to tell
you, while murderers are so near: but, in short,
sir, I was commander of that ship; my men have
mutinied against me; they have been hardly pre-
vailed upon to murder me, and, at last have set
me on shore in this desolate place, with these two
men with me, one my mate, the other a passenger,
where we expected to perish, believing the place
to be uninhabited, and knowing not what to think
of it yet."
"Where are those brutes, your enemies?" said
I; "do you know where they are gone?"—"There
they are, sir," said he, pointing to a thicket of
trees; "my heart trembles for fear they have seen
ns, and heard you speak: for, if they have, they
will murder us."
"Have they any fire-arms?" said I. He an-
swered, "They had only two pieces, and one that
they left in the boat." —"Well, then," said I,
"leave the rest to me. I see they are asleep. It
is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we not
rather take them prisoners?" He told me there
were two desperate villains among them, that it
was scarce safe to show any mercy to them, but
if they were secured, he believed all the rest would
return to their duty. I asked him which were
them. He told me, he could not, at that distance,
describe them; but he would obey my orders in
anything I would direct. "Well," said I, " let us
retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they
awake, and we will resolve farther." So they
willingly went back with me, and agreed that both
he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly
directed and commanded by me in everything; and
if the ship was not recovered, he would live and
die with me, in what part of the world soever I
would choose to send him; and all the others said
the same.
"Well," said I, " my conditions are but two:—
first, that while you stay on this island with me,
yoa will not pretend to any authority here; and if
1 put arms into your hands, you will upon any oc-
casion, give them up to me, and do no prejudice to
me or mine, upon this island,; and, in the mean-
time be governed by my orders. Secondly, that
when the ship is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and my man to England, passage free."
He gave me all the assurances that the invention
and faith of man could devise, that he would com-
ply with these most reasonable demands, and be-
sides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge
it, upon all occasions, as long as he lived.
"Well then," said I, "here are three muskets
for you, with powder and ball. Tell me next what
you think is proper to be done" He showed all
the testimony of his gratitude that he was able;
but offered to be wholly guided by me. I told him
I thought it was hard venturing anything; but the
best method I could think of was, to fire on them
at once, as they lay; and if any one were not killed
at the first volley, and offered to submit, we might
save them, and so put it wholly upon God's pro-
vidence to direct the shot.

He said very modestly that he was loath to kill
them, if he could help it, but that these two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of
all the mutiny in the ship, and if they escaped, we
should be undone still, tor they would go on board
and bring the whole ship's company, and destroy
us all. "Well then," said I, "necessity legitimates
my advice; for it is the only way to save our
lives." However, seeing him still cautious of
shedding blood, I told him thev should go them-
selves and manage as they found convenient.
In the middle of this discourse we heard some of
them awake, and soon after we saw two of them
on their feet. I asked him if either of them were
the men, who, he had said, were the heads of the
mutiny. He said, "No."—" Well then," said I,
"you may let them escape; as Providence seems
to have awakened them on purpose to save them-
selves. Now," said I, " if the rest escape you, it
is your fault."
Animated with this, he took the musket which I
had given him in his hand, and a pistol in his belt,
and his two comrades with him, each man a piece
in his hand. The two men who were with him
going first, made some noise, at which, one of the
seamen, who was awake, turned about, and seeing
them coming, he cried out to the rest; but it was
too late then, for, at the moment that he cried out,
the two men fired, the captain wisely reserving bis
own piece.
They had so well aimed their shot at the men
they knew, that one of them was killed on the
spot, and the other very much wounded; but not
being dead, he started up, upon his feet, and called
eagerly for help to the other; but the captain step-
ping up to him, told him it was too late to cry tor
help; that he should call upon God to forgive his
villany, and with that word, knocked him down
with the stock of his musket, so that he never
spoke more. There were three more in the com-
pany, and one of them was also slightly wounded.
By this time I was come, and when they saw the
danger they were in, and that it was in vain to re-
sist they begged for mercy. The captain told them
he would spare their lives if they would give him
an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery
they had been guilty of, and would swear to be
faithful to him in recovering the ship, and after-
wards in carrying her back to Jamaica, whence
they came. They gave him all the protestations of
sincerity that could be desired, and he was willing
to believe them, and spare their lives, which I was
not against; only I obliged him to keep them
bound, hand and foot, while they were upon the
island.
While this was doing, I sent Friday, with the
captain's mate, to the boat, with order s to secure
ber, and bring away the oars and sail, which they
did; and by-and-bye, the three straggling men
that were parted from the rest, came back again
npon hearing the guns fired; and seeing their cap-
tain, who before was their prisoner, but now their
conqueror, they submitted to be bound also.
It now remained that the captain and I should
inquire into one another's circumstances. I began
first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement, and
particularly at the wonderful manner of my being
tarnished with provisions and ammunition; and
indeed, as my story is a whole collection of won-
ders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected
from thence upon himself, and how I seemed to
have been preserved there on purpose to save his
life, the tears ran down bis face, and he could not
speak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I car-
ried him and his two men into my apartment,
leading them in just where I came out, viz., at the
top of the house, where I refreshed them with such
provisions as I had, and showed them all the con-
trivances I had made during my long inhabiting
this place.
All I showed them, all I said to them was per-
fectly amazing; but, above all, the captain admired
my fortification, and how perfectly T had concealed
my retreat with a grove of trees, which had now
been planted near twenty years, and the trees,
growing much faster than in England, was become
a little wood, and so thick that it was impassable
in any part of it but at that one side where I had
reserved my little winding passages into it. This
I told him was my castle, and my residence, but
that I had a seat in the country, as most princes
have, whither I could retreat upon occasion, and I
would shew him that, too, at another time; but at
present our business was to consider how to recover
the ship.
He agreed with me as to that; but told me he
was perfectly at a loss what measure to take, for
that there were still six-and-twenty hands on
board, who, having entered into a conspiracy, by
which they had all forfeited their lives to the law,
would be hardened into it now by desperation, and
would carry it on, knowing that if they were re-
duced they should be brought to the gallows as
soon as they came to England, or to any of the
English colonies, and that therefore there would be
no attacking them with so small a number as we
were.
1 mused for some time upon what he had said,
and found it was a very rational conclusion; and
it occurred to me, that, in a little while, the ship's
crew, wondering what was become of their com-
rades, and of the boats, would certainly come on
shore in their other boat, to seek for them, and that
then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too
strong for us; this, he allowed, was rational.
Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to do
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach,
so that they might not carry her off: and taking
everything out of her, leaving her so far useless as
not to be fit to swim. Accordingly we went on
board, took the arms which were left on board out
of her, and whatever else we found there, which
was a bottle of brandy, and another of mm, a few
biscuit cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump
of sugar, in a piece of canvass; the sugar was five
or six pounds; all of which were very welcome to
me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I
had been without for many years.
When we carried all these things on shore, we
knocked a great hole in her bottom, that if they
had come strong enough to master us, yet they
could not carry off the boat.
Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts that we
could be capable to recover the ship; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I
did not much question to make her fit again to
carry us away to the Leeward Islands, and call upon
our friends the Spaniards in our way.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had first, by main strength, heaved the boat up on
the beach, so high that the tide would not float her
off at high water-mark; and besides, had broken a
hole in her bottom, too big to be easily stopped,
and were sat down, musing what we should do,
we heard the ship fire a gnu, and saw her make a
waft with her ancient, as a signal for the boat to
come on board; but no boat stirred, and they fired
several times, making other signals for the boat.
At last, when all their signals and firing proved
fruitless, and they found the boat did not stir, we
saw them (by the help of my glasses,) hoist ano-
ther boat off, and row towards the shore; and we
fonnd, as they approached, that there were no less
than ten men in her, and that they had fire-arms
with them.
As the ship lay almost two leagues from the
shore we had a full view of them as they came.
The captain knew the persons and characters of all
the men in the boat, of whom he said that there
were three very honest fellows, who he was sure
were overpowered, and frightened; but that as for
the boatswain, who, it seems, was the chief officer
among them, and all the rest, they were bs out-
rageous as any of the ship's crew, and were no
doubt, made desperate in their new enterprise.
As soon as they got to the place where their
other boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach,
and came all on shore, hauling the boat up after
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid
they would rather have left the boat at anchor,
some distance from the shore, with some bands in
her to guard her, and so we should not be able to
seize the boat.
Being on shore, they all ran to the other boat;
and it was easy to see they were under a great
surprise to find her stripped, and a great hole in
the bottom. After this, they set up a great about;
but it was all to no purpose; then they came all
close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small
arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes
made the woods ring, but it was all one; those
in the cave we were sure could not hear, aud
those in onr keeping, though they heard it well
enough, yet durst give no answer.
They were so surprised at this, as they told ns
afterwards, that they resolved to go all on board
again to their ship, and let them know there that
the men were all murder-d, and the long boat
staved; accordingly, they immediately launched
their boat again, and got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the ship again; and set sail, giving their comrades
up for lost, and so he should still lose the ship,
which he was in hopes we should have recovered;
but he was quickly as much frightened the other
way.
They had not been long off with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on shore again;
and they left three men in the boat, and the rest
went up into the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great disappointment to us, for now
we were at a loss what to do; for our seizing
these seven men on shore would be of no advan-
tage to us if we let the boat escape, because they
would then row away to the ship, and then the
rest of them would be sure to weigh, and set sail;
and so oar hope of recovering the ship would be
lost. However, we had no remedy but to wait
and see what the issue of things might present.
The seven men came on shore, and the three who
remained in the boat put her off to a good distance
from the shore, and came to anchor to wait for
ihem, so that it was impossible for us to come at
them in the boat.
Those that came on shore kept close together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay, and we could see them
plainly, though they cuuld not see us. And when
they were come to the brow of the hill, where they
could see a great way into the valleys and woods
which lay towards the north-east part, and where
the island lay lowest, they shouted till they were
weary, and then they sat down to consider about
how they were to act. Had they gone to sleep as
the other party did, they had done for us; but they
were too full of apprehensions of danger to venture
to go to sleep, though they could not tell where
the danger was.
The captain made a very just proposal to me on
this consultation of theirs, viz., that perhaps they
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make
their fellows hear, and that we should all sally out
upon them just at the juncture when their pieces
were all discharged, and they would certainly
yield, and we should have them without blood-
shed. I liked the proposal, provided it was done
while we were near enough to come up to them
before they could load their pieces again.
But this event did not happen, and we lay still a
long time, very irresolute what course to take ; at
length I told them there would be nothing to be
done, in my opinion, till night; and then, if they
did not return to the boat, perhaps we might use
some stratagem with those in the boat to get them
on shore.
We waited a long while, and were very uneasy;
when we saw them all start up, and march to-
wards the sea. It seems they had such dreadful
apprehensions upon them of the danger of the place
that they resolved to go on board the ship again,
give their companions over for lost, and so go on
their intended voyage with the ship.
As soon as I perceived them go towards the
shore, I imagined that they had given over their
search and were for going back again; and the
captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was
ready to sink at the apprehensions of it; bat I pre-
sently thought of a stratagem to fetch them back
again, and which answered my end to a tittle.
I ordered Friday and the captain's mate to go
over the little creek westward, towards the place
where Friday was rescued, and at the distance of
about half a mile, I bade them halloo as loud as
they could; and as soon as they heard the seamen
answer them, they should return it again: and then
keeping out of sight, take a round, and then wheel
about again to me by such ways as I directed.
They were just going into the boat when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they presently heard
them; and answering, ran along the shore west-
ward, towards the voices they heard, when they
were stopped by the creek, the water being up,
they could not get over, and called for the boat to
come and set them over, as indeed I expected.
When they had set themselves over, I observed
that they took one of the three men out of her, and
lelt only two in the boat, having fastened her to
the stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for; and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their
business, I took the rest with me, and crossing the
creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men
before they were aware, one of them lying on the
shore between sleeping and waking, and going to
start up, the captain, who was foremost, ran in
upon him and knocked him down, and then called
upon him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead
man.
There needed very few arguments to persuade a
single man to yield, when he saw five men upon
him, and his comrade knocked down; besides,this
was, it seems, one of the three men who were not
so hearty in the mutiny as the rest of the crew ,
and therefore was easily persuaded not only to
yield, but afterwards to join sincerely with us.
In the meantime, Friday and the captain's mate
so well managed their business with the rest, that
they drew them, by hallooing and answering, from
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired
them, but left them where they were sure they
could not reach back before it was dark; and
indeed they were heartily tired themselves also, by
the time they came back to us.
It was several hours after Friday came back to
me before they got back to their boat; and we
could hear the foremost of them, long before they
came quite up, calling to those behind to come
along, and could hear them answer, and complain
how lame and tired they were, and not able to
come any faster, which was welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is
impossible to express their confusion when they
found the boat fast aground in the creek, and their
two men gone; we could hear them telling one
another that they were got into an enchanted
island; that either there were inhabitants in it,
and they should be all murdered; or else there
were devils and spirits in it, and they should be
carried away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their comrades
by their names, but got no auswer. After some
time we could see them by the little light there
was, run about like men in despair; and that
sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat
to rest themselves, then come on shore again, and
walk about, and so do the same thing over again.
My men would have fallen upon them in the
dark, but I was willing to spare them, and kill as
few of them as possible; being unwilling to hazard
the killing any of our men, knowing the others
were well armed. I resolved to wait and make
sure of them, and drew my ambuscade nearer, and
ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their
bands and knees, and get as near them as they
possibly could, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, when the
boatswain, who was the principal ringleader, and
had now shewn himself the most dispirited of all
the rest, walked towards them with two more of
their crew. The captain was so eager at having
the principal rogue so much in his power, that he
could hardly have patience to let him come so near
as to be sure of him, for he only heard his tongue
before; but when they came nearer, the captain
and Friday, starting up on their feet, let fly at
them.
The boatswain was killed on the spot, the next
man was shot through the body, and fell just by
him, though he did not die till an hour or two after,
and the third ran for it.
At the noise of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men—
viz., myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-
general; the captain, and his two men, and three
prisoners of war, whom we had trusted with fire-
arms.
We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that
they could not see our number: and I made the
man left in the boat, who was now one of us, to
call them by name, to try if he coold bring them to
a parley, which fell out just as we desired. So he
calls out, as loud as he could, to one of them—
"Tom Smith! Tom Smith!" Tom Smith answered
immediately, "Who's that? Hobinaon?" for it
seems he knew his voice. The other answered,
"Aye, aye; for God's sake, Tom Smith, throw
down your arms, and yield, or yon are all dead men
this moment."
"Who must we yield to ?—Where are they t"
says Tom Smith again.—" Here they are," says he.
"Here is our captain, and fifty men with him, and
they have been hunting you these two hours. The
boatswain is killed; Will Frye is wounded; and I
am a prisoner: and if you do not yield, you are all
lost."
"Will they give us quarter then?'-' says Tom
Smith, "and we'll yield."—" I'll go and aBk, if
you promise to yield," says Robinson. So he asked
the captain, and the captain himself then called
out,—" You, Smith, you know my voice; if you,
lay down your arms immediately, and submit, yon
shall all have your lives, all but Will Atkins."
Upon this, Will Atkins cried out, " For God's
sake, captain, give me quarter! What have I
done? They have all been as bad as I!" which
was not true; for it seems that this Will Atkins
was the first man who laid hold of the captain
when they first mutinied. However, the captain
told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,
and trust to the governor's mercy, by which he
meant me, for they called me governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I sent the man that had
parleyed with them, and two more, who bound
them all; and then my great army of fifty men,
which, particularly with those three, were in all
but eight, came up and seized upon them all, and
upon their boat, only that I kept myself and one
more out of sight, for reasons of state.
Our next work was to repair the boat, and to
think of seizing the ship; and as for the captain,
now he had leisure to parley with them, he expos-
tulated with them upon the villany of their prac-
tices with him, and how certainly it must bring
them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps
to the gallows.
They all seemed very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives. As for that, he told them that the
governor was an Englishman: and that he might
hang them all there if he pleased; but as he had
given them all quarter, he supposed that he would
send all of them to England, except Atkins, whom
he was commanded by the governor to advise to
prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in
the morning. Though this was entirely a fiction
of his own, yet it had the desired effect; for
Atkins fell down upon his knees to beg the captain
to intercede with the governor for his life; and all
the rest begged of him, for God's sake, not to be
sent to England.
It now occurred to me that the time of our deli-
verance was come, and that it would be a most
easy thing to bring these fellows in, to be hearty
in getting possession of the ship. So I retired in
the dark from them, that they might not see what
kind of a governor they had, and called the captain
to me. When I called, as if at a great distance,
one of the men was ordered to speak again, and
say to the captain, "Captain, the commander calls
for you;" and presently the captain replied, "Tell
his excellency I am just a-coming." So they all
believed that the commander was just at hand,
with his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told him my
project for seizing the ship, which pleased him ex-
ceedingly, and I resolved to put it in execution the
next morning. .... j j.
But in order to execute it with more art, and to
be sure of success, I told him we must divide the
prisoners, and that he should go and take Atkins
and two more of the worst of them, and send them
bound to the cave where the others lay. So Friday
and the two men who came on shore with the cap-
tain, conveyed them to the cave as to a prison.
The others I ordered to my bower, where they were
pinioned, and left secure enough.
To these, in the morning, I sent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them: in a word,
to try them, and tell me whether he thought they
might be trusted or no, to go on board and surprise
the ship. He talked to them of the injury done
him; of the condition they were brought to; and
that, though the governor had given them quarter
for their lives, as to the present action, yet that if
they were sent to England, that they would all be
hanged in chains; but that if they would join us in
so just an attempt as to recover the ship, that he
would have the governor's engagement for their
pardon.
Any one may guess how readily such a proposal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
mised, with deep imprecations, that they would be
faithful to him to their death, and that they should
owe their lives to him, and would go with him all
over the world: and that they would own him for
a father to them as long as they lived. "Well,"
said the captain, "I must go and tell the governor
what you say; and see what I can do to bring him
to consent to it." So he brought me an account of
the temper he found them in, and that he verily be-
lieved they would be faithful. However, that we
might be secure, I told him he should go back again,
and choose out five of them, and tell them that they
should see that they did not want men, but he
would take out those five to be his assistants, and
that the governor would keep the other two, and
the three who were sent prisoners to the castle (my
cave,) as hostages for the fidelity of those five ; aud
if they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five
hostages should be hanged in chains alive upon the
•bor>>.
This looked severe, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnest. However they had no
way left them but to accept it; and it was now
the business of the prisoners, as much as the captain,
to persuade the other five to do their duty. Our
strength was now thus ordered for the expedi-
tion :—First, the captain, his mate, and passenger.
Second, the two prisoners of the first gang to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had given
their liberty, and trusted them with arms. Third,
the other two, whom I had kept in my bower till
now pinioned, were now released. Fourth, these
five released, at last; so that there were twelve in
all, besides five we kept in the cave, as hostages
for the fidelity of the others.
I asked the captain if he was willing to venture
with those hands on board the ship; for as for me
and my man Friday, I did not think it proper for
us to stir, having seven men left behind: and it
was employment enough for us to keep them asun-
der, and supply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep
them fast; but Friday went twice a day to them,
to supply them with the necessaries; and I made
the other two carry provisions to a certain dis-
tance, where Friday was to take it.
When I showed myself to the two hostages, it
was with the captain, who told them I was the
person the governor had ordered to look after them,
and that it was the governor's pleasure they should
not stir anywhere, but at my discretion; that if.
they did, they should be fetched to the castle and
be laid in irons; so that we never suffered them to
see me as governor, but appeared as another person,
and spoke of the governor, the garrison, the castle,
and the like upon all occasions.
The captain had now no difficulty before him,
but to furnish his two boats, stop the breach on
one, and man them. He made his passenger cap-
tain of one with four other men; and himself, and
his mate, and five more, went in the other. They
contrived their business very well; for they came
up to the ship about midnight. As soon as they
came within call of the ship, he made Robinson
hail them, and tell them he had brought off the men
and the boat, but that it was a lbog time be-
fore they had found them, and the like; holding
them in chat, till they came to the ship's side, when
the captain and the mate, entering first with their
arms immediately knocked down the second mate
and the carpenter with the butt end of their mus-
kets, being faithfully seconded by their men. They
secured all the rest that were upon the main and
quarter decks, and began to fasten the hatches to
keep them down who were below, when the other
boat, and their men entering at the forechains, se-
cured the forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle
which went down into the cook room, making
three men they found there prisoners. When this
was done, and all was safe upon the deck, the
captain ordered the mate, with three men, to
break into the round house, where the new rebel
captain lay; who having taken the alarm, arose,
and with two men and a boy, had gotten fire
arms into their hands; and when the mate, with
a crow, split open the door, the new captain and
them men fired boldly among them, and wounded
the mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm,
and wounded two more of the men, but fortunately
killed nobody.
The mate calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with
his pistol, shot the new captain through the head,
the bullet entering at his mouth, and came out
again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke
a word; upon which the rest yielded, and the ship
was taken effectually, without any more lives lost.
As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain
ordered seven guns to be fired, which was the sig-
nal agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his
success, which, you may be sure, I was glad to
hear, having sat watching upon the shore for it
till two o'clock in the morning.
Having heard the signal plainly, I laid me down,
and being very much fatigued, I fell sound asleep,
when shortly I was awoke by the noise of a gun:
and starting up, 1 heard a man call me by the
name of "Governor," and presently I knew the
captain's voice, when climbing up to the top of the
hill, there he stood, and pointing to the ship, he
embraced me in his arms. "My dear friend and
deliverer," says he, "there's your ship: for she is
all yours, and so are we, and all that belongs to
her." I cast my eyes to the ship, and there she
rode, about half a mile off the shore, for they had
weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters
of her, and the weather being fair, had brought her
to an anchor just against the mouth of a little creek,
and the tide being up, they had brought the pinnace
in near the place where I first landed my rafts, and
just at my door.
I was, at first, ready to sink down with surprise,
for I saw my deliverance indeed visibly put into
my hands, all things easy, and a large ship just
ready to carry me away, whither I pleased to go.
He perceived my situation, and immediately pulled
a bottle out of his pocket and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought with him on purpose
for me. After I drank it, I sat down upon the
ground, and it was a good while before I could
speak to him.
After some time, I came to myself, and then I
embraced him in my turn, as my deliverer, and we
rejoiced together. I told him, I looked upon him
as a man sent from Heaven to deliver me, and that
the whole transaction seemed to be a chain of
wonders.
When we had talked awhile, the captain told
me he had brought me some little refreshment, such
as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches, who
had been so long his masters, had not plundered
him of. Upon this he called aloud to his men, and
told them to bring the things on shore that were
for the governor, and, indeed, it was a splendid
present. First, he had brought me a case of bottles
full of cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira
wine, two pounds of excellent tobacco. He
brought me also a box of sugar, a box of flour, a
bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice,
and abundance of other things. But, besides these,
and what was a thousand times more useful to me,
he brought me six clean new shirts, six very good
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of shoes,
a hat, and one pair of stockings, and a very good
suit of clothes of his own, which had been worn
very little; but the clothes felt very awkward and
uneasy upon me at first.
After all these things were brought into a little
apartment, we began to consult what was to be
done with the prisoners we had, and whether we
might venture to take them away with us or no,
especially two of them, whom we knew to be in-
corrible and refractory to the last degree; and the
captain said he knew that they were such rogues,
that there was no obliging them; and if he did
carry them away, it must be in irons, like male-
factors, to be delivered over to justice, at the first
English colony he could come at. Upon this I told
him, I durst undertake to bring the two men he
spoke of to make it their own request that he should
leave them upon the island, of which the captain
said he should be very glad. I accordingly sent
for them, and entered seriously into discourse with
them upon their circumstances. One of them
answered in the name of the rest, that they had
nothing to say bnt this, that when they were taken,
the captain promised them their lives, and they
humbly implored my mercy. But I told them I
knew not what mercy to shew them; for, as for
myself,! had resolved to quit the island with all
my men, and had taken passage with the captain
to go to England; and, as for the captain, he would
not carry them to England, but as prisoners in
irons, to be tried for mutiny and running away
with the ship; the consequence of which, they must
needs say, would be the gallows; so that I could
not tell what was best for them, unless they had a
mind to take their fate in the island; if they desired
that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave it. I
had some inclination to give them their lives, if
they could shift on shore. They seemed very
thankful for it; and said they would rather ven-
ture to stay here, than be carried to England to be
hanged.
I then told them I would put them into the story
of my living there, and put them into the way of
making it easy to them. Accordingly I gave them
the whole history of the place, and of my coming
to it; showed them my fortifications, the way I
made my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes,
and, in a word, all that was necessary to make
them easy; I told them the story of the Spaniards
that were to be expected, for whom I left a letter,
and made them promise to treat them in common
with themselves.
I left them five muskets, three fowling pieces,
and three swords. I had about a barrel and a half
of powder, which I left them. I gave them a de-
scription of the way I managed the goats, and di-
rections to milk and fatten them, to make both
butter and cheese. In a word, I gave them every
part of my own story : I told them I would prevail
with the captain to leave them two barrels of gun-
powder more, and some garden seeds, which, 1 told
them I would have been very glad of; also-1 gave
them the bag of peas which the captain had brought
me, and bade them to be sure to sow and increase
them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day,
and went on board the ship. The next morning
two of the five men came swimming to the ship's
side, and making a most lamentable complaint of
the other three, begged to be taken into the ship,
for God's sake, for they should be murdered.
The captain pretended to have no power without
me: but, after some difficulty, and solemnly pro-
mising amendment, they were taken on board, and
were shortly after soundly whipped, after which
they proved very honest and quiet fellows.
Some time atter this, I went with the boat on
shore, the tide being up, with the thiLgs promised
to the men, and the captain, at my intercession,
sent their chests and clothes, which they took and
were very thankful for. I also encouraged them,
by telling them that if it lay in my way to send
any vessel to take them in I would not forget
them.
When I quitted this island, I carried on board,
for relies, the great goat-skin cap I had made, my
umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot not
to take the money I had laid by me so long useless.
And thus I left the island, 19th of December, by
the ship's account, in the year 1686, after I had
been upon it twenty-eight years, two months, and
nineteen days; being delivered from the second
captivity the same day of the month that I made
my escape from among the Moors at Sallee.
In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England, the 11 th of June, in the year 1687, having
been absent thirty-five years.
When I came to England, I was as perfect a
stranger as if I had never been known there. My
benefactor and faithful steward, whom I left in
trust with my money, was alive, but had had great
misfortunes in the world, was become a widow
the second time, and was very low in circum-
stances. I made her easy as to what she owed
me, assuring her I would give her no trouble;
but, on the contrary, in gratitude to her former
faithfulness to me, I relieved her as much as my
little stock would afford, which at that time would
indeed allow me to do but little for her; but I
assured her I would never forget her former kind-
ness to me; nor did I forget her, when I had suf-
ficient to help her, at a future time.
I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but
my father was dead, and my mother, and all the
family extinct, except two sisters, and two of the
children of one of my brothers: and as I had been
long ago given over for dead, there had been no
provision made for me, so that, in a word, 1 found
nothing to relieve or assist me, and the little money
M 2
I had would not do much for me, as to settling in
the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude, indeed, which
I did not expect; and this was, that the master of
the ship, whom I had so happily delivered, having
given a very handsome account to the owners, of
the manner how I had saved the lives of the men
and the ship, they invited me to meet them, and
some other merchants concerned, and all together
made me a very handsome compliment upon the
subject, and a present of almost two hundred
pounds sterling.
But, alter making several reflections upon the
circumstances of my life, and how little way this
would go towards settling me in the world, I re-
solved to go to Lisbon, and see if I could get any
information of the state of my plantation in the
Brazils, aud what was become of my partner, who,
I supposed, had (or some years now given me over
for dead.
With this view, I took shipping for Lisbon, where
I arrived in April following, my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all these ramblings,
and proving a most faithful servant upon all occa-
sions. When I came to Lisbon, I found out by
inquiry, and to my particular satisfaction, my old
friend, the captain of the ship, who first took me up
at sea, off the shore of Africa. He was now grown
old, and had left off the sea, having put his son
into the ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.
The old man did not know me, and I scarcely knew
him; but he soon recollected me, when I told him
who I was.
After some passionate expressions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired alter my plantation and my
partner. The old man told me he bad not been in
the Brazils for about nine years; but he could as-
mire me, that when he came away, my partner was
living; but that the trustees whom I had joined
with him to take cognizance of my part, were both
dead; that he believed I should have a very good
account of the improvement of my plantation, for,
in the belief of my being cast away and drowned,
my trustees had given in the account of the produce
of my part of the plantation to the procurator
fiscal, who had appropriated it, in case I never
came to claim it, one-third to the king, and two-
thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be ex-
pended for the benefit of the poor, and for the
conversion of the Indians to the Catholic faith;
but that if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim
the inheritance, it would be restored; only that the
improvement, or annual production being, as he
said, distributed to charitable uses, he thought could
not be restored.
I was a little concerned and nneasy at this ac-
count, and inquired of the old captain how it came
to pass that the trustees should thus dispose of my
effects, when they knew that I had made my will,
and made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal
heir, &c. He told me that was true; but as there
was no proof of my being dead, he could not act
as executor, until some certain account should
come of my death; and besides, he was not willing
to intermeddle with a thing so remote: that it was
true he had registered my will, and put in bis
claim, and could he have given any account of my
being dead or alive, he would have acted by pro-
curation, and taken possession of my ingenio (the
sugar-houses,) and given his son, who was now in
the Brazils, orders to do it.
The old man then asked me if he should put me
in a method to nnke my claim to my plantation.
I told him I thought to go over to it myself. He
said I might do so if I pleased; but that if I did
not, there were ways enough to secure my right,
and immediately to appropriate the profits to my
use: and HH there were ships in the river of Lishon
just ready to go to the Brazils, he made me enter
my name in a public register, with his affidavit,
affirming, upon oath, that I was alive, and that I
was the same person who took up the land for
planting the said plantation at first. This being
regularly attested by a notary, and a procuration
affixed, he directed me to send it, with a letter of
his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at
the place, and then proposed my staying with him
till an account came of the return.
Never was any thing more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in less than
seven months I received a large packet from the
survivors of my trustees, the merchants for whose
account I went to sea; and as the Brazil ships
come all in fleets, the same ships which brought my
letters brought my goods, and the effects were sate
in the Tagus before the letters came to my hands.
By these it appeared I was now master, all on a
sudden, of above five thousand pounds sterling in
mouey; and had an estate I might well call it, in
the Brazils, of above a thousand pounds a year, as
sure as an estate of lands in England; and, in a
word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew
how to understand, or how to compose myself for
the enjoyment.
The first thing I did to recompense my original
benefactor, my good old captain, who had been
first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me in
the beginning, and honest to me in the end, I
showed him all that was sent me. I told him that
next to the providence of Heaven, which disposeth
all thing*, it was owing to him; and that it now
lay in me to reward him. So I sent for a notary,
and caused him to draw up a procuration, em-
powering him to be my receiver of the annual pro-
fits of my plantation, and appointing my partner to
account to him, and make the returns by the usual
fleets to him, in my name. And a clause in the
end, being a grant of one hundred moidores a year
to him, during his life, out of the effects; and fifty
moidores a year to his son after him, for his life;
and thus I requited my old man.
I was now to consider which way to steer, my
course next, and what to do with the estate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in-
deed, I had more care upon my head now, than I
had in my silent state of life on the island, where
I wanted nothing but what I bad, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I bad now a great
charge upon me, and my business was now to
secure my money. I knew not where to put it,
or whom to trust with it; my old patron the cap-
tain, indeed, was honest, and my interest in the
Brazils seemed to summon me thither: but now I
could not tell how to think of going thither till I
had settled all my affairs. At first I thought of
my old friend the widow, who, I knew was honest,
and, would be just to me; but then she was in
years and but poor, and for aught I knew, might
be in debt; so that, in a word, I had no way but
to go back to England myself, and take my effects
with me.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my passage through Spain and France; nothing but
what other travellers have given an account of
with much more advantage than I cm. I travelled
from Toulouse to Paris, and, without any consider-
able stay, came to Calais, and landed at Dover, the
18th of J miliary, after having had a severe cold
Reason to travel in.
1 had all my newly-discovered estate safe about
me; the bills of exchange which I brought with
me having been currently paid. My principal guide
and privy counsellor was my good old widow,
who, in gratitude for the money I had sent her,
thought no pains too much, or care too great, to
employ for me.
I began to think of leaving my effects with this
woman, and setting out for Lisbon, and so to the
Brazils. But now another scruple came in my
way, and that was religion; for as I had enter-
tained some doubts about the Roman religion, even
while I was abroad, especially in my state of soli-
tude, so I knew there was no going to the Brazils
for me, much less going to settle there, unless I
resolved to be a sacrifice to my principles, be a
martyr to my religion, and die in the inquisition;
so I resolved to stay at home, and if I could find
means, to dispose ot my plantation.
To this purpose I wrote to my old friend at
Lisbon, who, in return, gave me notice, that be
could easily dispose of it there; but that if I
thought fit to give him leave to offer it in the name
of the survivors of my trustees, who lived in the
Brazils, and fully understood the value of it; he
did not doubt but I should make four or five
thousand pieces of eight the more for it.
Accordingly 1 agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did so; and in about eight months
more, the ship being returned, he sent me an ac-
count that they had accepted the offer, and had
remitted thirty-three thousand pieces of eight to a
correspondent of theirs at Lisbon to pay for it.
In return, I signed the instrument of sale in the
form which they sent me from Lisbon, and sent it
to my old man, who sent me bills of exchange for
thirty-two thousand eight hundred pieces of eight
for the estate, reserving the payment of one hun-
dred moidores a year to him, the old man, during
his life, and fifty moidores afterwards to his son for
his life, which I had promised him, and which the
plantation was to make good as a rent-charge.
Any one would think that, in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards: but I was inured to a wandering life, had
no family, no relations, nor, however rich, had I
contracted much acquaintance: and though I had
sold my estate in the Brazils, yet I could not keep
that country out of my head, and had a great mind
to be upon the wing again, especially as I could
not resist the strong inclination I had to see my
island.
My true friend, the widow, earnestly persuaded
me from it, and so far prevailed with me, that for
almost seven years she prevented my running
abroad; during which time I took my two nephews,
the children of one of my brothers, into my care.
The eldest, baring something of his own, I bred
np as a gentleman, and gave him a settlement of
some addition to his estate after my decease; the
other I put out to a captain of a ship, and after
five years, finding him a sensible, bold, enterpris-
ing young fellow, I put him into a good ship, and
sent him to sea. And this young fellow after-
wards drew me in, old as I was, to farther adven-
tures myself.
In the meantime, I in part settled myself here;
for, first of all, I married, and had three children,
two sons and one daughter. But my wife dying
and my nephew coming home, with good success
from a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go
abroad, and this opportunity, prevailed, and I cu-
gaged to go in his ship as a private trader to the
East Indies. In this voyage, I visited my new co-
lony in the island, saw my successors, the Spa-
niards; had the whole story of their lives, and of
the villains I left there; how at first they insulted
the poor Spaniards; how they afterwards agreed,
disagreed, united, and separated; how at last the
Spaniards were obliged to use violence with them,
how they were subjected to the Spaniards, how
honestly the Spaniards used them; a history, if it
were entered into, as full of variety and wonderful
accidents, as my own part, particularly also as to
their battles with the Caribbeans, who landed se-
veral times upon their island, and as to the
improvement they made upon the island itself, and
how five of them made an attempt upon the main-
land, and brought away eleven men and five women
prisoners; by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young children on the island.
Here I stayed about twenty days, left them sup-
plies of all necessary things, and particularly of
arms, powder, shot, clothes, tools, and two work-
men, which I brought from England with me, via.,
a carpenter and a smith.
Besides this, I shared the island into parts with
them, reserved to myself the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts respectively as they
agreed on; and having settled all things with
them, and engaged them not to leave the place, I
returned to England. /
