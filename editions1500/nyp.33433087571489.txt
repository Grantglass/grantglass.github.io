PREFACE.
The importance, and the practical benefit to be derived from the
study of Intellectual Arithmetic, not only as a preparation for busi-
ness life, but as a means of developing and strengthening the
thinking and reasoning powers, and of thorough mental culture,
can not be over-estimated. Not only is it a necessary study for
young pupils, but indispensable to the more advanced student, as
a preparation for the prompt and accurate business man. And it
is believed that, as a general rule, the most critical, correct, and
ready students of mathemati*s are those who have been most
thoroughly drilled in intellectual arithmetic.
This work has been prepared more especially for advanced classes,
and is designed for those who have first been well taught in the
primary book, and for such as are pursuing the study of written
arithmetic, or algebra, and who have never been thoroughly exer-
cised in this branch of study.
Only a few of the many points of difference between this and
other similar works, and which, it is believed, renders this superior
to them, will be referred to.
It is more complete, comprehensive, and progressive in its char-
acter. The arrangement and classification are more strictly sys-
tematic, and in accordance with the natural order of mathematical
science. The development of principles, and their applications,
are shown by a more numerous selection, and greater variety of
appropriate examples, progressively arranged, commencing with
those that are simple and easy, and advancing to those more com-
plex and difficult.
At intervals, and especially in the closing sections of each chap-
ter, examples are given containing such a combination of principles,
and forms of analysis, as to require a knowledge of almost every
principle previously taught, thus affording the pupil a thorough
review, as well as requiring him to classify his knowledge of what
he has been over.
One of the most important, and, it is thought, one of the most
original and useful features of this work, is the full, concise, and
uniform system of Analysis it contains, — the result of long expe-
rience in the school-room.
Particular attention is invited to the subjects of Fractions, Per*
centage, and Interest; their treatment is peculiar, and adapted to
obviate many of the difficulties, and greatly abbreviate most of the
operations in them.

DKitW THEOL SBM LIB
The chapter of Miscellaneous Examples will afford a valuable
and thorough drill to the advanced student of arithmetic or alge-
bra. They contain a great variety of principles, and while they
may be considered difficult, yet the full analysis given of every
principle, and the selection of numbers so adapted to the conditions
of the question as to produce results free from larga and difficult
fractions, will render a mental solution^of them comparatively easy.
In conclusion, we may be allowed to express the belief, that
in this work the thorough teacher will find a desideratum long
sought in this department of science,—the means of mental dis-
cipline and development such as has been furnished by no similar
treatise.
THE AUTHOR.
SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.
Pupils of nearly the same degree of advancement should be
classed together. Regular exercises should be assigned to the
class, and sufficient time allowed them to thoroughly examine
their lesson before being called upon to recite.
The use of the book at the time of recitation should be strictly
prohibited, except, perhaps, in some of the more difficult lessons
in the latter part of the work.
Each example should be read but once, slowly and distinctly,
the pupils called upon promiscuously, who should arise, stand
erect, repeat the example, and then give the analysis. This will
secure close attention.
Every question should be clearly and thoroughly analyzed, and
the pupil required to adhere strictly to the forms of solution given,
unless better ones can be substituted; and in no case should he
be allowed to omit the conclusion, commencing with " Therefore."
The class should be encouraged to detect and correct errors in
statement or analysis, to criticise and make proper inquiries, all
of which should be signaled by the uplifted hand.
It is suggested that the class be occasionally exercised upon
"Ringing the Changes," as explained in the Appendix, and which
may be applied to a great number and variety of examples. It
will not only afford a valuable drill, but a pleasant and enlivening
exercise.

skates, and 6 shillings for a cap, he paid. for both, the
sum of 9 shillings and 6 shillings. 'The sum of 9 shil-
lings and 6 shillings is 15 shillings. Therefore, he paid

O. Subtraction is the process of finding the difference
between two numbers; the resnlt is called the Difference or
Remainder. The sign of subtraction is written thus, —,
and is read minus. Placed between two numbers, or quan-
tities, it shows that the one after it is to be taken from the
one before it. 9 — 5 shows that 5 is to be subtracted from
9, and is read nine minus Jive.

Analysis. 57 is equal to 5 tens and 7 units, and 34 is
equal to 3 tens and 4 units; 3 tens from 5 tens leave 2 tens,
or 20, and 4 units from 7 units leave 3 units, which added
to 20 make 23.

apiece?
Analysis. Since 1 cow cost 23 dollars, 3 cows, which

to 2 tens and 3 units; 3 times 3 units are 9 units, and 3
times 2 tens are 6 tens, or 60; 60 and 9 are 69. Therefore,
if I cow cost 23 dollars, 3 cow* will cost 69 dollars.

37. 1. What is understood by one half, one
third, one fourth, one fifth, &c.?
Ans. When a number or thing, as a unit or an
apple, is divided into two equal parts, each of the
parts is called one half; when into three equal parts,
each of the parts is called one third; two of the parts
are called two thirds, &c.

6. How many halves in 4?
Analysis. Since in 1 there are 2 halves, in 4 there are 4
times 2 halves, or 8 halves. Therefore there are 8 halves in 4.
7. How many halves in 5? in 6?

13. How many halves in 10 and 1 half?
14. How many thirds in 9 and 2 thirds?
15. In 8 halves how many whole things?
Analysis. Since in 2 halves there is one whole thing,
in 8 halves there are as many whole things as 2, the num-
ber of halves in 1, is contained times in 8, which is 4
times. Therefore, in 8 halves there are 4 whole things.

PERCENTAGE.
The terms, percentage and per cent., signify by the hun-
dred, or hundredths, that is, a certain number of parts of each
one hundred parts, of whatever denomination. Thus, by 5
per cent. is meant 5 cents of every 100 cents, $5 of every
$100, 5 bushels of every 100 bushels, &c. Therefore, 5
per cent. equals 5 hundredths, (ToW,) or ^y. 8 per cent., 8
hundredths, or ^ of the given number or quantity.
1. A man, having $40, lost 3 per cent, of it; hoyt
many dollars did he lose?

of it in gambling; how many dollars did he lose,
and what per cent. of the whole had he left?
77. 1. What fraction of a number is 8 per cent.
of it?

of any number or thing.
2. What fraction of a number is G per cent.? 7

and how many did he lose?
•• 6. What per cent. of a barrel of flour is £ of it?
Analysis. Since the lohole of any number or thing is
equal to I JO per cent., % of one barrel of flour is equal to
| of 100 per cent., or 40 per cent. Therefore, §c.

8G. Interest is a sura paid for the use of borrowed
money, or on demands after they become due.
The Principal is the money lent, or the sum for which
interest is paid.
The Amount is the sum of the principal and interest.
The Rate per Cent. is the sum paid for the use of
SlOO or 100 cents for one year. Thus, if $6 be paid for
the use of $100 one year, the rate is C per cent. per
annum.
The interest on any sum for one year is always a certain
number of hundredths of the principal. Thus, the'interest
of any sum for one year, at 5 per cent., is 5 hundredths
(t&o) or 57j of tnc principal; at 8 per cent. it is 8 hun-
dredths (xfu) or ^ of the principal.
Practically, 80 days are considered a month, and 12
months a year, in computing interest. When no time is
named, one year is always understood.
The rate of interest is established by law; and taking
more than such rates is termed usury.
1. What is the yearly interest of $80, at 5 per cent.?
Analysis. Since the interest is 5 per cent., or TJ^, equal
to ^ of the principal, the interest of $80 is ^ of $80,
or $4. Therefore, Ifc.

Analysis. Since the interest for 1 year at 8 per cent
is Tfu, equal to of the principal, for 3 years it is 3
times or of the principal. ^ of $150 is $6, anil
A °.f $150 is G times $6, or 836. Therefore, Sfc.

1 month is ^ of a year; of 1 month is ^ of T^-,
or of 1 year, and 3§ months, equal to J-g8-, is 18 times

which is 12 per cent. of its cost; what did,it cost?
6. A gentleman bought 6 horses, for which he paid
a sum of money which in 2 years 6 months, at 4 per
cent., would have given him $90 interest; what did
he pay apiece for the horses?
7. A person deposits -f of his money in the bank,
which brings him an annual income of $1500, at 10
per cent.; the remaining | he invests in business
which yields him 20 per cent. profit; what are his

8. Two persons engaged in trade; A furnished |
of the capital, and B |; at the end of 3 years and 4
months they found that they had made a clear profit
of $5000, which is per cent. per annum on the
money invested ; how much capital did each furnish?
9. A capitalist invested 4 of his money in railroad
stock, which depreciated 5 per cent. in value; the
remaining | he invested in bank stock, which at the

cent. of the investment; what was the whole amount
of his capital, and what was his entire loss or gain?
92. 1. What principal will, in 3 years 4 months,
at 5 per cent, amount to $700.
Analysis. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months, at 5
per cent., is fa of the principal, the principal g, added
to the interest fa, equals the amount fa; hence $700 is fa of
the principal. Since §700 is fa, fa is f of $700, or $100,
awti $100 is fa of 6 times $100, or $600. Therefore, $c.
2. What principal in 5 years, at 6 per cent., will

INTELLECTUAL ARITHMETIC. [93.
93. 1. In what time, at 5 per cent., will |60
gain $15 interest?
Analysis. The gain, or interest, is or % of the prin-
cipal, equal to 25 per cent. of the principal. (77, Ex. 7.)
If a given principal gain 5 per cent. in 1 gear, it will re-
quire as many years to gain 25 per cent. as 5 per cent. is
contained times in 25 per cent., or 5 years. Therefore, Sfc.
Or thus: Since $G0 in 1 year, at 5 per cent., will gain
$3 interest, it will require as many years for $G0 to gain
$15 interest, as $3 is contained times in $15, which is 5
times.
2. How long will it take $120 to gain $24 interest,
at 6 per cent.?
3. In what time will $500 gain $35, at 7 per
cent.?
4. In what time will $120 gain $40, at 10 per
cent.?
5. In what time will $80 gain $6, at 3 per cent.?
6. In what time will $300 gain $84, at 7 per
cent.?
7. In what time will $160 gain $20, at Q\ per
cent.?
8. In what time will $49 gain $12.25, at 5 per
cent.?
9. In what time will any given principal double
itself at 4 per cent.?
Analysis. Since, to double itself, any sum of money
must gain 100 per cent., at 1 per cent., it will require 100
years, at 4 per cent., £ of 100 years, or 25 years. There-
fore, fyc.
10. In what time will a given principal double it-
self- at 5 per cent.?
11. In what time will a given principal double it-
self at 7 per cent.?
12. In what time will a given principal double it-
self at G per cent.?
13. In .what time will a given principal double it- -
self at 10 per cent.?
14. In what time will $500 double itself, at 12*
per cent.?
15. In what time will $175 double itself at 20 per
cent.?
16. In what time will a given principal treble it-
self at 5 per cent.?
Analysis. A given principal will treble itself at 1 per
cent. in 200 years; at 5 per cent. in \ of 200 years, or 40
years.
17. Iu what time will $100 treble itself at 6 per
cent.? at 7 per cent.? at 8 per cent.? at 10 per
cent.?
94. 1. A man loaned $75 for 4 years, and re-
ceived $18 interest; what was the rate per cent.?
Analysis. Since the gain, or interest, for 4 years, is
*ff> or A °f rf'e principal, for 1 year it is \ of ^ or ^Jfo
of the principal, equal to G per cent. Therefore, Sfc.
Or, thus: At 1 per cent., the interest of SI for 4 years is
4 cents, and of $75 it. is 75 times 4 cents, which are 300
cents, equal to $3. Since $3 interest is 1 per cent. of $75
for 4 years, $18 interest is as many per cent. as $3 is
contained times in $18, which is G times, equal to G per
cent.
2. At what per cent. will $200 gain $49 interest
in 3£ years?

in 5 years?
9. At what per cent. will $800 gain $75 interest
in 1 year and 3 months?
10. At What per cent. will $180 gain $45 interest
in 3 years and 9 months?
11. At what per cent. will $1250 gain $312.50
interest in 2 years 6 months?
12. At what per cent.-will $2500 gain $200 in-
terest in 1 year and 4 months?
13. At what per cent. will a given principal double
itself in 5 years?
Analysis. Since a given principal must gain 100 per
cent. to double itself in 1 year, to double itself in 5 years will
require i of 100 per cent., or 20 per cent. Therefore, fyc.
14. At what per cent. will a given principal double
itself in 10 years?
15. At what per cent. will a given principal double
itself in 12 years 6 months?
16. At what per. cent. will $200 double itself in 4
years?
17. At what per cent. will $100 double itself in 8
years?
18. At what per cent. will $150 double itself in
15 years?
19. At what per cent. will $500 double itself in
16 years 8 months?
20. At what per cent. will $175 double itself in
2 years 6 months?

95. The present worth of a note payable at a future
time is such a sum as, put aUinterest at the given rate per
cent. until it becomes due, will amount to the face of the
note.
Discount is an allowance made for the payment of money
before it becomes due, and is obtained by subtracting the
present worth from the given sum or face of the note.
1. What is the present worth of $180 payable in
3 years 4 months at 6 per cent.?
Analysis. Since the interest for 3 years 4 months at
6 per cent. is \ of the principal, (88,) the amount, $180,
is equal to the principal, 4j, added to the interest, -J, equal to
§ of the principal. Since $180 is § o f the principal, £ of
# $180, or $30, is \, and $30 is \ of 5 times $30, or $150.
Therefore, fyc.
Note. The discount is the difference between $180 and $150, which
is $30.
2. What is the present worth of a note for $36.90,

beggar, and 8 cents the increase paid to all, there were as
many beggars as 2 is contained times in 8, which is 4 times.
Therefore, fyc.
2. EdwUrd gave G plums to each of his playmates,

8. If 24 chestnuts be divided among some boys,
giving 4 apiece to \ of them, and 2 apiece to the
others, how many boys are there?
Analysis. Since one boy received 4 chestnuts as often
as another received 2 chestnuts, 2 boys received 6 chestnuts;
there were as many times 2 boys as 6 is contained times
in 24, which is 4 times, and 4 times 2 boys are 8 boys.
Therefore, Sfc.
9. Mary gave her chickens 2G grains of corn; ^
of them had 5 grains each, the others but 3 each;
how many chickens had she?
Note. The above gives the following question : —
10. 5 times | of a certain number, plus 3 times -J
af the same number, is 26; what is the number?
11. A class received 29 merit marks; J of them
received 5 apiece, -\ of the remainder 3 apiece, f of
the remainder 2 apiece, and the rest 1 apiece; how
many scholars in the class?
12. 26 melons were stolen, £ of the party getting
4 each, the rest 3 apiece, except 2, who obtained but
2 apiece; how many were there in the party?
Analysis. Had the last 2 obtained 3 each, there would
have been 28 melons; then 4 times £ of a number, plus 3
times £ of the same number, or i, would equal 28. Since
28 is -J of a number, j- of 28, or 4, it and 4 is £ of 2
times 4, or 8. Therefore, fyc.
13. 4 times £ of a number, plus 3£ times the
same number, is equal to 28 plus f>; what is the
number?
14. Henry said that 4 years more than of his

16. A grocer received $10 for a lot of baskets;
for ^ of thum he had 6 dimes each, for A of the re-
mainder plus 3, 4 dimes each, for ^ of the rest plus
2, 3 dimes each, and for the rest 2 dimes each; how
many baskets did he sell?
17. 5 times Henry's age is 3 more than 4 times f
of it increased by b' times £ of it; how old is he?
Analysis. 5 times Henry's age equals J35-, 4 times § of
it, plus G times ^ of it, equals J34-. and less Jg4 equals 3
of it, which, according to tiie conditions of the question, is
3; and 3 is i of '6 times 3, or 9. Therefore, fyc.
18. 6 times a number is 4 less than 7 times | of

she took I of the quantity in beef, the rest in pork,
and paid tor it; how many pounds did she get?
20. Four times a number is 6 greater than 5 times
f of the same number; what is the number?
21. A farmer, wishing to buy a flock of sheep,
. found, if he paid $2 a head, he would have $60 left;
if he paid $5 a head, he had not enough to pay for

*" Analysis. Since 27 is the sum of two numbers whose
difference is 5, 27 less 5, or 22, would be twice the less num-
ber; % of 22 is 11, <Ae less number, which increased by o
equals 10, or the greater number. Therefore, fyc.

18. Emily purchased some lace and some ribbon
for 30 cents; \ the cost of the lace, increased by \
the difference between the cost of the lace and rib-
bon, equals the cost of the ribbon; what did she pay
for each?
19. Wilbcr paid 20 shillings for a pair of skates
and a knife; twTice the difference between the cost of
the two, plus l the cost of the knife, equals the cost
of the skates; what did he pay for each?
20. A horso and harness cost $34 ; f of the cost
of the horse is $1 more than the cost of the harness;
what was the cost of each?
'103. 1. A grocer paid $12.60 for 30 bushels of
potatoes, giving 50 cents a bushel for good ones, and
20 cents a bushel for poor ones; how many bushels
were good?
Analysis. If all had been good, he would have paid
$15, or $2.40 more than he did; each bushel of poor ones
made a difference of 30 cents; hence there were as many
bushels of poor ones as 30 cents (the difference on 1 bushel)
is contained times in $2.40, (the difference on all,) which is
8 times, equal to 8 bushels of poor ones; the difference be-
tween 30 bushels and 8 bushels is 22 bushels, equal to the
good ones. Therefore, fyc. •
2. A farmer bought 28 sheep for $76, paying $3
for old sheep, and $2 for yearlings; how many old

8. A man engaged to work 25 days, on condition
that he should receive $2 for every day's labor, and
159
pay $1 for board every day he was idle ; he received
at settlement $38; how many days was he idle't
Analysis. As many days as $3, (the difference made
by 1 idle day,) is contained times in $12, {the difference
made by all the idle days,) which is 4 times. Hierefore he
was idle 4 days.
9. A man was engaged for 20 days to copy, r&.
ceiving $2.50 for every day's labor, and forfeiting $1

10. Job, having some chestnuts, gave | of them
to John, who, after eating 6, gave | of what remained
to his sister, and still had 5 left; how many had Job?
Analysis. If John gave |- to his sister, the 5 left was %;
5 is j- of 4 times 5, or 20, and 20, plus the G he ate, make

wages for clothes, $12 for a watch; he then lent |
of what he had left, and having paid $3 for a pair of
boots, had*$5 left; what were his wages?
15. A laborer engaged to work 20 days, on con-
dition that he should have 12 dimes for a day's labor,
and pay 2 dimes for every idle day for board; he

many days was he idle?
104. 1. A rope 28 feet in length was broken so
that I of the longer piece was equal to the shorter;
what was the length of each piece?
Analysis. Tlie longer piece is divided into 5 equal
parts, 2 of which equal the shorter; the sum of the 2
pieces is 7 equal parts, one of which equals 4 of 28 feet,
or 4 fed; 2 parts equal 2 times 4 feet, which are 8 feet,
the shorter piece; 5 parts equal 5 times 4 feet, which are 20
feet, the longer piece. Therefore, Sfc.

11. Homer and Harlan have 48 apples; £ of
Homer's, plus 6, equal the number Harlan has;
how many has each?
Analysis. Harlan hat 6 more than J at many as Ho-
mer, which makes the sun 48, 6 greater than if he had but
$ as many; Homer's are divided into 4 parts, of which 3
parts plus G apples are equal to Harlan's; then 4 parts
plus 3 parts, plus 6 apples, equal 48, 7 parts equal 42,
aful \ of 42, or 6, equals 1 part. 3 parts plus 6 equal
24, the number Harlan has, and 4 parts equal 24, the num-
ber Homer has. Therefore, Sfc.
12. Rochester is 52 miles from Geneva, via Vic-

cost of each?
16. Wilson has 15 oranges and lemons; \ of the
oranges equals \ of the lemons; how many of each
has he?
Analysis. Since £ of the oranges equals $ of the lemons,
f, or all the oranges, equal § of the lemons; we then have
the oranges and lemons divided into 5 equal parts, 2 parts
of which equal the oranges, and 3 the lemons, SfC.

the value of what is in it; what is the purse worth?
21. A person, being asked the time of day, replied,
"The time past noon is equal to \ of the time to
midnight." What was the hour?
Analysis. The time to midnight is divided into 5 equal
parts, one of which equals the time past noon; then 5 parts
plus 1 part equals 6 parts;and 12 hours, the time from
noon to midnight, must be f of the time it lacked of being
midnight; since 12 is f, which is £ of f, will be £ of 12
hours, which is 2 hours. Therefore the hour was 2 o'clock,
P. M.
22. What was the time, provided § of the time
past midnight equaled the time to 10 o'clock, A. M.?
23. | of the time from this instant to 5 o'clock,
P. M., equals | of the time past midnight; what is

105. 1. Two pieces of cloth contain 88 yards;
f oi the first piece equals \ of the (second, pins 4
yards; how many yards in each piece?
altsis. If £ equal \ + 4, \ will equal £ of\ + 4,
which is |+2, this is \ of 3 times \ +- 2, or \ + 6;
then we have 1 piece equal to f the other plus 6 yards, or 1
piece divided into 5 parts, and 3 q/" these parts plus C yards
ej«a£ the other piece; hence 5 ^arte plus 3 parts plus 6 yards
equal 38 yards, or 8 />ar£« and 6 yards, equal 38 yards; 38
yarcfe minus 6 yarcfe eywa/ 32 yards, or 8 parts, &c.
2. A lad inquiring his mother's age, his father

was 5 feet long, the second was as long as the first
plus \ of the third, and the third was as long as the
other two; what was the length of the rope 2
Analysis. Since the third piece is as long as the other
two, it must be % of the rope ; the second piece, being J as
long, is \; and the 5 feet which the second exceeds k, with
the 5 feet of the first piece, makes 10 feet, which must be the
other fourth; 4 times 10 is 40. Therefore, <&o.

106. 1. Malcom is 8 years old, and Martin 25;
in how many years "will Malcom be as old as
Martin?
Analysis. 8 years since, Martin was 17 years of age;
in 17 years from that time, or, since Malcom is 8 years old,
in 17 less 8, or 9 years from this time, Malcom will be 17
years old, and Martin will be twice 17, or 34 years old.
Therefore, fyc.

4. Henry played at marbles with Charles, who
had 45; Henry won as many as he had to commence
with; when they quit, each had the same number;
how many had both?
Analysis. Since Henry won as many as he had, he left
off playing with twice as many as he began with ; and Charles,
now having the time number, must have had 3 times as
many as Henry when they commenced playiny. 45 is 3
times -J of 45, or 15, and 45 -f- 15 it 60. Therefore, <*rc.

all? -•
9. A has 10 sheep, C has as many as A and f as
many as B, and B has as many as A and C; how
many sheep have they all?
* •
Analysis. Since B has as many as A and C, lie must
have £ of the whole; then 10 sheep, plus 10 -f" §- of £,
plus equals £ -f" 20, or the whole number of sheep; hence
20 equals £ the number, and 20 is \ of 6 times 20, or 120
sheep. Therefore, tyc.

menced with; how many had each at first?
18. The difference between two numbers is 10;
if 4 be taken from the larger and added to the less,
2| times the larger will equal 3| times the smaller;
what are the numbers?
19. Jason bought a watch, and had $20 remain-
ing; he then gave 2 times the cost of the watch for
a rifle, and had ^ of his money left; what did tho
rifle cost?
20. Find the ages of A, B, and C, by knowing
that C's age at A's birth was 5i times B's, and now
is equal to the sum of A's and B's; also that if A
were now 3 years younger, or B 4 years older, A's
age would be equal to | of B's.

distance B had run equaled the distance he was
ahead of A; how far did B run?
6. Three men bought a horse; A paid $25, which
was \ of what B and C paid; B paid | as much as
A and C; what did B and C pay?
7. The hour and minute hands of a watch are
together at 12 o'clock; when will they next be to*
gether?
Analysis. Since the minute hand passes the hour hand
11 times in 12 hours, if both are at 12, the minute hand will
pass the hour hand the first time in ^ of 12 hours, or in
l-j*j hours, equal to 5^r minutes past I o'clock. There-
fore, Sfc.

APPENDIX.
Tins author desires to call the attention of teachers to the number and
variety of change* that may be wreught upon the examples of the Sec-
tions frem which the following have been selected, as well as upon many
otheis of the same class, and which may apprepriately be termed " King-
ing the Changes." It is not recommended that these changes be ap-
plied to all the examples, but used as an occasional exercise, and limited
according to the time and convenience of the teacher.
It is recommended to teachers to exercise their classes in these
*' changes," not so much for the novelty of them, as for the enlivening
effect preduced upon the class, and especially for the peculiar facilities
they affird for thorough mental discipline; and while, at first, to some
they may appear severe and too mathematical, they will very soon become
easy ana comprehensible.
To aid beginners, the blackboard may be used to advantage; and t3
illustrate, take the example which has been written out in full in Section
71, page 171-3:—
f of 35 is I of how many thirds of 18?
which may be written on the board thus: —
f X 35 = $X T X 18?
Call upon seme pupil to read the question according to the Jirst form,
and to solve the question according to the form of analysis given; an-.l
the answer, if correct, placed over the 3, will fulfill the conditions of tha
question; substitute this number, and erase another, thus :—
*X35 = $X$X?
which is read
\ of 35 is § of § of what number?
Solve this as before, and so continue until all the numbers have been
erased, and replaced by solution.
When the class have become familiar with the exercise, the use of the
blackboard should be dispensed with, and the pupil be required to " ring
the changes " by simply hearing the first form of the question read.
Each question, and its form of solution. should be given by the pupil,
hut he may be allowed to give results in the solution that have been
previously determined by analysis, in order to shorten the work and avoid
monotonous repetition.
Members of the class should be called upon premiscuously, and en-
couraged to ask questions, and to detect errers either in the statement or
solution of questions. The teacher should read an example once, slowly
and distinctly, then call upon some one of the class who shall commence
operations. and continue to give questions, forms, solutions, and conclu-
sions. until signaled to sit, or another pupil detecting an error, raises
the hand, when some other one should be called upon, who should re-
sume where the last one left off; and so on.
A teacher who has not practiced a class upon these changes, cannot
tonceive of the interest, close attention, and perfect enthusiasm that
may be created, as well as the thorough mental discipline attained, by this
exercise; and it is firmly believed that, upon trial, it will commend itself
to the judgment and approval of every live teacher.
