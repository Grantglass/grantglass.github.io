PREFACE.
PROGRESS and improvement characterize almost every art and
science; and within the last few years the science of Arithmetic
has received many important additions and improvements, which
have appeared from time to time successively in the different treatises
published upon this subject.
In the preparation of this work it has been the author's aim to
combine, and to present in one harmonious whole, all these modern
improvements, as well as to introduce some new methods and prac-
tical operations not found in other works of the same grade; in short,
to present the subject of Arithmetic to the pupil more as a science
than an art; to teach him methods of thought, and how to reason,
rather than what to do; to give unity, system, and practical utility to
the science and art of computation.
The author believes that both teacher and pupil should have the
privilege, as well as the benefit, of performing at least a part of the
thinking and the labor necessary to the study of Arithmetic ; hence
the present work has not been encumbered with the multiplicity of
"notes," "suggestions," and superfluous operations so common'to
most Practical Arithmetics of the present day, and which prevent the
cultivation of that self-reliance, that clearness of thought, and that
vigor of intellect, which always characterize the truly educated mind.
The author claims for this treatise improvement upon, if not supe-
riority over, others of the kind in the following particulars, viz.: In
the mechanical and typographical style of the work; the open and
attractive page; the progressive and scientific arrangement of the
subjects; clearness and conciseness of definitions; fullness and accu-
racy in the new and improved methods of operations and analyses;
brevity and perspicuity of rules; and in the very large number of
examples prepared and arranged with special reference to their prac-
tical utility, and their adaptation to the real business of active life. The
iv
PBEFACE
answers to a part of the examples have been omitted, that the learner
may acquire the discipline resulting- from verifying the operations.
Particular attention is invited to improvements in the subjects of
Common Divisors, Multiples, Fractions, Percentage, Interest, Pro-
portion, Analysis, Alligation, and the Roots, as it is believed these
articles contain some practical features not common to other authors
upon these subjects.
The improvements in Percentage made necessary by the financial
changes of the last few years are especially noticeable. The different
kinds of United States Securities, Bonds, and Treasury Notes are
described, and their comparative value in commercial transactions
illustrated by practical examples. The difference between Gold and
Currency, and the corresponding difference in prices, exhibited in
trade, are taught and illustrated, and many other things that every
commercial student and business man ought to know and understand.
It is not claimed that this is a perfect work, for perfection is im-
possible; but no effort has been spared to present a clear, scientific,
comprehensive, and complete system, sufficiently full for the busi-
ness man and the scholar; not encumbered with unnecessary theories,
end yet combining and systematizing real improvements of a practical
and useful nature. How nearly this end has been attained the intel-
ligent and experienced teacher and educator must determine.

NOTICE.
This book has been newly electrotyped in the latest and best style
of typography. No change has been made in the text, except to cor-
rect positive errors, and drop a few obsolete terms from the tables.
These improvements are designed to give new life to a book that
has proved its real merits by the very large circulation it has obtained

DEFINITIONS.
1. Quantity is any thing that can be increased, dimin
ished, or measured.
2. Mathematics is the science of quantity.
3. A Unit is one, or a single thing.
4. A Number is a unit, or a collection of units.
5. An Integer is a whole number.
6. The Unit "of a Number is one of the collection of
units forming the number. Thus, the unit of 23 is 1; of
23 dollars, 1 dollar; of 23 feet, 1 foot.
7. Like Numbers are numbers that have the same kind
of unit. Thus, 74,16, and 250; 7 dollars and 62 dollars;
4 feet 6 inches, and 17 feet 9 inches.
8. An Abstract Number is a number used without
reference to any particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17;
365; 8540.
9. A Concrete Number is a number used with refer-
ence to some particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 dollars;
365 days; 8540 men.
1. The unit of an abstract number is 1, and Is called Unity.
2. Concrete numbers are, by some, called Denominate Numbers. Denomination
means the name of the unit of a concrete number.
10. Arithmetic is the Science of numbers, and the Art
of computation.
11. A Sign is a character used to indicate an operation,
or for abbreviating an expression.
12. A Rule is a prescribed method for performing an
operation.
Define quantity. Mathematics. A unit. A number. An integer.
The unit of a number. Like numbers. An abstract number. A
concrete number. The unit of an abstract number. Denominate
numbers. Arithmetic. A sign, or symbol. A rule.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
13. Notation is a method of writing or expressing num-
bers by characters.
14. Numeration is a method of reading numbers ex
pressed by characters.
15. Two systems of notation are in general use—tht,
Roman and the Arabic.
The Roman Notation ts supposed to hare been first need by the Romans; hence
its name. The Arabic Notation was introduced into Europe by the Arabs, by wh«n
it was supposed to have been invented. But investigations have shown that it was
adopted by them about COO years ago, and that it has been in use among the Hin-
doos more than 3000 years. From this latter fact it is sometimes called the Indian
Notation.
The Roman Notation.
16. Employs seven capital letters to express numbers.
Thus,
Letters. I V X L C D M
Values. One. Five. Ten. Fifty. fcSed. tho^Bd.
17. The Roman Notation is founded upon five principles,
as follows:
1st. Repeating a letter repeats its value. Thus, II repre-
sents two, XX twenty, CCC three hundred.
2d. If a letter of any value is placed after one of greater
value, its value is to be added to that of the greater. Thus,
XI represents eleven, LX sixty, DC six hundred.
3d. If a letter of any value be placed before one of greater
value, its value is to be taken from that of the greater.
Thus, IX represents nine, XL forty, CD four hundred.
Define notation. Numeration. What systems of notation are now
in general use? From what are their names derived? What are used
to express numbers in the Roman notation? What is the value of
each? What is the first principle of combination? Second? Tnird?
NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
3
4th. If a letter of any value be placed between two letters,
cacli of greater value, its value is to be taken from the sum
of the other two. Thus, XIV represents fourteen, XXIX
twenty-nine, XCIV ninety-four.
5th. A bar or dash placed over a letter increases its value
one thousand times. Thus, V signifies five, and V five thou-
sand; L fifty, and L fifty thousand.

The Arabic Notation.
18. Employs ten characters or figures to express num-
bers. Thus,
Figures. 0123 456789
Names, Cipher. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.
19. The first character, or cipher, is called naught, be-
cause it has no value of its own. The other nine charaoters
are called significant figures, because each has a value of its
own.
20. The significant figures are also called Digits, a word
derived from the Latin term digitus, which signifies finger.
21. The naught or cipher is also called nothing, and zero.
The ten Arabic characters are the Alphabet of Arithmetic,
and by combining them according to certain principles, all
numbers can be expressed. We will now examine the most
important of these principles.*
22. Each of the nine digits has a value of its own.
hence any number not greater than 9 can be expressed by
one figure.
* Fractional and decimal notation, and the notation of componnd numbers, will
be discussed in their appropriate places.
What are used to express numbers in the Arabic notation? What
is the value of each? What general name is given to the significant
figures? Why? Numbers less than ten, how expressed?
11
23. As there is no single character to represent ten, we
express it by writing the unit, 1, at the left of the cipher, 0,
thus, 10. In the same manner we represent
2 tens, 3 tens, i tens, 5 tens, 6 tens, 7 tens, 8 tens, 9 tens,
or or or or or or or or
Twenty, Thirty, Forty, Fifty, Sixty, Seventy, Eighty, Ninety,
20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80; 90.
24. When a number is expressed by two figures, the right
hand figure is called units, and the left hand figure tens.
We express the numbers between 10 and 20 by writing
the 1 in the place of tens, with each of the digits respec-
tively in the place of units. Thus,
Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fonrteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
In like manner we express the numbers between 20 and
30, between 30 and 40, and between any two successive tens.
Thus, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 47, 56, 72, 93.
The greatest number that can be expressed by two figures
is 99.
25. We express one hundred by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of two ciphers, or the number 10 at the left
hand of one cipher; thus, 100. In like manner we write
two hundred, three hundred, etc., to nine hundred. Thus,
One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine
hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred,
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 80Q, 900.
26. When a number is expressed by three figures, the
right hand figure is called units, the second figure, tens, and
the left hand figure, hundreds.
As the ciphers have, of themselves, no value, but are
always used to denote the absence of value in the places they

occupy, -we express tens and units with hundreds, by writ-
ing, in place of the ciphers, the numbers representing the
tens and units. To express one hundred fifty we write 1

hundred ninety-two, we write 7 hundreds, 9 tens, and 2
units; thus,

4. Express by figures nine hundred.
5. Express by figures two hundred ninety.
6. Write eight hundred nine.
7. Write five hundred five.
8. Write five hundred fifty-seven.
27. We express one thousand by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of three ciphers, the number 10 at the left
hand of two ciphers, or the number 100 at the left hand of
one cipher; thus, 1000. In the same manner we write two
thousand, three thousand, etc., to nine thousand; thus,

28. When a number is expressed by four figures, the
places, commencing at the right hand, are units, tens, hun-
dreds, thousands.

To express hundreds, tens, and units with thousands, we
write in each place the figure indicating the number we wish
to express in that place. To write four thousand two hun-
dred sixty-nine, we write 4 in the place of thousands, 2 in
the place of hundreds, 6 in the place of tens, and 9 in the
place of units; thus,

to these come hundreds of thousands, as tens and hundreds
come in their order after units. Ten thousand is expressed

pressed by removing the unit, 1, still one place further to
the left, or by writing it at the left hand of five ciphers;
thus, 100000. We can express thousands, tens of thou-
sands, and hundreds of thousands in one number, in the
same manner as we express units, tens, and hundreds in one
number To express five hundred twenty-one thousand
eight hundred three, we write 5 in the sixth place, counting

For convenience in reading large numbers, point them off,
by commas, into periods of three figures each, counting from
the right hand or unit figure. This pointing enables us to
read the hundreds, tens, and units in each period with
facility.

sively, units, tens, and hundreds of millions, and then fol-
low units, tens, and hundreds of each higher name, as seen

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
This is called the French method of pointing off the periods, and is the one in
general use in this country.
31. Figures occupying different places in a number, as
units, tens, hundreds, etc., are said to express different
orders of units.
Simple units are called units of the first order.
Tens "" " "" second"
Hundreds "" " "" third"
Thousands "" " ""fourth «
Tens of thousands" " " ""fifth"
and so on. Thus, 452 contains 4 units of the third order,
5 units of the second order, and 2 units of the first order.
1,030,600 contains 1 unit of the seventh order (millions), 3
units of the fifth order (tens of thousands), and G units of
the third order (hundreds).
Examples for Practice.
Write in figures, and read the following numbers 5
1. One unit of the third order, four of the second.
2. Three units of the fifth order, two of the third, one of
the first.
3. Eight units of the fourth order, five of the second.
4. Two units of the seventh order, nine of the sixth, four
of the third, one of the second, seven of the first
.
5. Three units of the sixth order, four of the second.
6. Nino units of the eighth order, six of the seventh, three
of the fifth, seven of the fourth, nine of the first.
7. Four units of the tenth order, six of the eighth, four
of the seventh, two of the sixth, one of the third, five of the
second.
8. Eight units of the twelfth order, four of the eleventh,
six of the tenth, nine of the seventh, three of the sixth, five
of the fifth, two of the third, eight of the first.
Units of different orders are what!
17
32. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations,
several important principles are derived, which we will now
present.
1st. Figures have two values, Simple and Local.
The Simple Value of a figure is its value when taken
alone; thus, 2, 5, 8.
The Local Value of a figure is its value when used with
another figure or figures in the same number; thus, in 842
the simple values of the several figures are 8, 4, and 2 ; but
the local value of the 8 is 800; of the 4 is 4 tens, or 40 j
and of the 2 is 2 units.
When a figure occupies units' place, its simple and local values are the same.
2d. A digit or figure, if used in the second place, ex-
presses tens; in the third place, hundreds; in the fourth
place, thousands; and so on.
3d. As 10 units make 1 ten, 10 tens 1 hundred, 10 hun-
dreds 1 thousand, and 10 units of any order, or in any place,
make one unit of the next higher order, or in the next „
place at the left, wo readily see that the Arabic method of
notation is based upon the following
Two General Laws.
I. The value of units of the different orders increases from
right to left, and decreases from left to right, in a tenfold
ratio.
II. Every removal of a figure one place to the left, increases
its local value tenfold; and every removal of a figure one place
to the right, diminishes its local value tenfold.
Thus,'
6 is 6 units.
60 is 10 times 6 units.
600 is 10 times 6 tens.
6000 is 10 times 6 hundreds.
60000 is 10 times 6 thousands.

4th. The local value of a figure depends upon its place
from units of the first order, not upon the value of the
figures at the right of it. Thus, in 425 and 400, the value
of the 4 is the same in both numbers, being 4 units of the
third order, or 4 hundred.
Care should be taken not to mistake the local value of a figure for the value of the
whole number. For, although the value of the 4 (hundreds) is the same in the two
numbers. 425 and 400, the value of the whole of the first number is greater than that
tf the second.
5th. Every period contains three figures (units, tens, and
hundreds), except the left hand period, which sometimes
contains only one or two figures (units, or units and tens).
33. As all the principles upon which the writing and
reading of whole numbers depend have now been analyzed,
we will present these principles in the form of rules.
Rule for Notation.
I. Beginning at the left hand, write the figures belonging
to the highest period.
II. Write the hundreds, tens, and units of each successive
period in their order, placing a cipher wherever an order
of units is omitted.
Rule for Numeration.
I. Separate the number into periods of three figures each,
commencing at the right hand.
II. Beginning at the left hand, read each period separately,
and give the name to each period, except the last, or period
of xinits.
34. Until the pupil can write numbers readily, it may be
well for him to write several periods of ciphers, point them
off, and over each period write its name; thus,

Addition is the process of uniting several numbers of
the same kind into one equivalent number.
37. The Sum or Amount is the result obtained by the
process of addition.
38. The sign, +, 13 called plus, which signifies more.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that they are
to be added; thus, 6 + 4, shows that 6 and 4 are to be added.
39. The sign, =, is called the sign of equality. When
placed between two numbers, or sets of numbers, it signifies
that they arc equal to each other; thus, the expression
6 + 4=10, is read 6 plus 4 is equal to 10, and denotes that
the numbers 6 and 4, taken together, equal the number 10.

1. A farmer sold some hay for 102 dollars, six cows for
162 dollars, and a horse for 125 dollars; what did he
receive for all?
Analysis. Arrange the numbers so that
units of like order shall stand in the same
column. Then add the columns separately,
for convenience commencing at the right hand,
and write each result under the column added.
Thus, we have 5 and 2 and 2 are 9, the sum of
the units; 2 and 6 are 8, the sum of the tens;
1 and 1 and 1 are 3, the sum of the hundreds.
Hence, the entire amount is 3 hundreds 8 tena
and 9 units, or 389.

operation. Analysis. Arranging the num-
bers us in Case I, we first add the
column of units, and find the sum to
be 17 units, which is 1 ten and 7
units. Write the 7 units in the place
of units, and the 1 ten in the place of
tens. The sum of the figures in the
column of tens is 15 tens, which is 1
hundred, and 5 tens. Write the
5 tens in the place of tens, and the
1 hundred in the place of hundreds.
Next add the column of hundreds,
and find the sum to be 14 hundreds,
which is 1 thousand and 4 hundreds. Write the 4 hundreds in the
place of hundreds, and 1 thousand in the place of thousands. Lastly,
by uniting the sum of the units with the sums of the tens and hun-
dreds, we find the total amount to be 1 thousand 5 hundreds 6 tens

In any colnmn is 10 or more than 10, it produces one or more unite of a higher order,
which must be added to the next column. This process is sometimes called "car-
rying the tens."
2. In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results without naming the numbers
separately; thus, instead of saying 7 and 5 aro 12, and 5 are 17, simply pronounce
the results, 7,12,17, etc.

42. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers to be added so that the units
of the same order shall stand in the same column; that is,
units under units, tens under tens, etc.
II. Commencing at units, add each column separately, and
write the sum underneath, if it be less than ten.
IIL If the sum of any column be ten or more than ten, writt
the unit figure only, and add the ten or tens to the next column.
IV. Write the entire sum of the last column.
Proof. 1st. Begin with the right hand or unit column,
and add the figures in each column in an opposite direction
from that in which they were first added; if the two results
agree, the work is supposed to be right. Or,
2d. Separate the numbers added into two sets, by a hori-
zontal line; find the sum of each set separately; add these
sums, and if the amount be the same as that first obtained,
the work is presumed to be correct.
By the methods of proof here given, the numbers are muted In new combina-
tions, which render it almost impossible for two precisely similar mistakes to
occur.
The first method is the one commonly used In business.

47. The Difference or Remainder is the result ob-
tained by the process of subtraction.
The minuend and subtrahend must be like numbers; thus, 5 dollars from 9 dol-
lars leave 4 dollars; 5 apples from 9 apples, leave 4 apples; but it would be absurd
to say 5 apples from 9 dollars, or 6 dollars from 9 apples.
48. The sign, —, is called minus, which signifies less.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that the one
after it is to be taken from the one before it. Thus, 8—6

trahend, taken from 8, the minuend, equals 2, the
remainder.

so from the 8 hundreds we take 1 hundred, which equals 10 tens, and
add to the 3 tens, making 13 tens; 5 tens from 13 tens leave 8 tens,
which we write in the remainder in tens' place. As we have taken
1 hundred from the 8 hundreds, 7 hundreds only are left; 3 hundreds
from 7 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, which we write in the remainder
in hundreds' place, and we have the whole remainder, 487.

the method of subtracting; in practice the process should be performed mentally,

Operation. Analysis. Since we cannot take 9 units from 8
units, we add 10 units to 6 units, making 16 units;
- 9 units from 16 units leave 7 units. But as we have
g added 10 units, or 1 ten, to the minuend, we shall
have a remainder 1 ten too large, to avoid which, we
add 1 ten to the 5 tens in the subtrahend, making 6
4.8 7 tens. We can not take 6 tens from 4 tens; so we
add 10 tens to 4, making 14 tens; 6 tens from 14
tens leave 8 tens. Now, having added 10 tens, or 1 hundred, to the
minuend, we shall have a remainder 1 hundred too large, unless we
add 1 hundred to the 3 hundreds in the subtrahend, making 4 hun-
dreds; 4 hundreds from 8 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, and we have
for the total remainder, 487, the same as before.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
The process of adding 10 to the minuend is sometimes called borrowing 10, and
that of adding 1 to the next figure of the subtrahend, carrying one.
51. From the preceding illustrations we hare the fol-
lowing
Rule. I. Write the less number under the greater, pla&
ing units of the same order in the same column.
II. Begin at the right hand, and take each figure of the
subtrahend from the figure above it, and write the result un-
derneath.
III. If any figure in the subtrahend be greater than the
corresponding figure above it, add 10 to that upper figure be-
fore subtracting, and then add 1 to the next left hand figure
of the subtrahend.
Proof. Add the remainder to the subtrahend, and if
their sum he equal to the minuend, the work is supposed
to be right.

L Multiply 374 by 6.
Analysis. In this example it is
required to take 374 six times. If we
take the units of each order 6 times,
we shall take the entire number (
times. Therefore, writing the multi
plier under the unit figure of the mul-
tiplicand, we proceed as follows: 0
times 4 units are 24 units; 6 times 7
tens are 42 tens; 6 times 3 hundreds
are 18 hundreds; and adding these
partial products, we obtain the entire
product, 2844.

The operation in this example may bo performed in an-
other way, which is the one in common use.
operation. Analysis. Writing tho numbers as before, begin
3^ at the right hand or unit figure, and say: 0 times 4
q units are 24 units, which is 2 tens and 4 units; write
the 4 units in the product in units' place, and reserve
2244 the 2 tens to add to the next product; 0 times 7 tens
are 42 tens, and the two tens reserved in the last
product added, are 44 tens, which is 4 hundreds and 4 tens; write tho
4 tens in the product in tens' place, and reserve the 4 hundreds to add
to the next product; 0 times 3 hundreds are 18 hundreds, and 4 hun-
dreds added are 23 hundreds, which being written in the product in
the places of hundreds and thousands, gives, for the entire product,
2244.
61. The unit value of a number is not changed by re-
peating tho number. As the multiplier always expresses
times, the product must have the same unit value as the
multiplicand. But since the product of any two numbers
will be the same, whichever factor is taken as a multiplier,
either factor may be taken for the multiplier or multiplicand.
In multiplying, learn to pronounce the partial results, as in addition, without
naming* the numbers separately; thus, in the last example, instead cf saying 6 times
4 are 24, G times 7 are 42 and 2 to carry are 44, 6 times 3 arc IS and 4 to carry are 22,
pronounce only the results, 24, 44, 22, performing the operations mentally. This
will greatly facilitate the process of multiplying.

Then adding the two products, the entire product is 17158.
1. When the multiplier contains two or more figures, the several results obtained
by multiplying by each figure are called partial products.
2. When there are ciphers between the significant figures of the multiplier, pass
over them, and multiply by the significant figures only.
63. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following general
Rule. I. Write the multiplier under the multiplicand, plac-
ing units of the same order under each other.
II. Multiply the multiplicand by each figure of the multi-
plier successively, beginning with the unit figure, and write
the first figure of each partial product under the figure of the
multiplier used, writing down and carrying as in addition.
III. If there are partial products, add them, and their sum
will be the product required.
64. Proof. I. Multiply the multiplier by the multipli-
cand, and if the product is the same as the first result, the
work is correct. Or,
2. Multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier diminished
by 1, and to the product add the multiplicand; if the sum
be the same as the product by the whole of the multiplier,
the work is correct.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
CONTKACTIOTsTS.
Case I
.
65. "When the multiplier is a composite number.
A Composite Number is one that may be produced by
multiplying together two or more numbers; thus, 18 is a
composite number, since 6x3 = 18; or, 9 x 2 = 18; or,
3 x 3 x 2 = 18.
66. The Component Factors of a number are the sev-
eral numbers which, multiplied together, produce the given
number; thus, the component factors of 20 are 10 and 2
(10x2=20); or, 4 and 5 (4x5=20); or, 2 and 2 and 5
(2x2x5=20).
The pupil mnst not confound the factors with the parts of a number. Thus, the
factors of which 12 is composed, are 4 and 3 (4 x 3= 12); while the parts of which 12
is composed are 8 and 4 (8+4=12), or 10 and 2 (10+2=12). The factors are multi-
plied, while the parts are added, to produce the number.

72. Division is the process of finding how many times
one number is contained in another.
73. The Dividend is the number to be divided.
74. The Divisor is the number to divide by.
75. The Quotient is the result obtained by the process
of division, and shows how many times the divisor is con-
tained in the dividend.
1. When the dividend does not contain the divisor an exact number of limes, the
part of the dividend left is called the remainder, and it must be less than the
divisor.
2. As the remainer is always a part of the dividend, it is always of the same name
or kind.
8. When there is no remainder the division 1b said to he exact.
76. The sign, -4-, placed between two numbers, denotes
division, and shows that the number on the left is to be di-
vided by the number on the right. Thus, 20-v-4=5, is read,
20 divided by 4 is equal to 5.
Division is also indicated by writing the dividend above,

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
1. How many times is 8 contained in 2528?
operation. Analysis. As 8 is not contained in 2 thou-
8 ) 2528 ( 316 sands, we take 2 and 5 as one number, and
24. consider how many times 8 is contained in this
partial dividend, 25 hundreds, and find that it
12 is contained 3 hundreds times, and a remainder.
8 To find this remainder, we multiply the divisor,
8, by the quotient figure, 3 hundreds, and sub
tract the product, 24 hundreds, from the par
tial dividend, 25 hundreds, and there remains
1 hundred. To this remainder we bring down
the 2 tens of the dividend, and consider the 12 tens a second partial
dividend. Then, 8 is contained in 12 tens 1 ten time and a remain-
der; 8 multiplied by 1 ten produces 8 tens, which, subtracted from
12 tens, leave 4 tens. To this remainder we bring down the 8 units,
and consider the 48 units the third partial dividend. Then, 8 is con-
tained in 48 units 0 units times. Multiplying and subtracting as
before, we find that nothing remains, and the entire quotient is 31G.

46 the result in the quotient on the

multiply the divisor, 23, by the
quotient figure, 2, and subtract the
product, 46, from the part of the
dividend used, and to the remainder bring down the next figure of
the dividend, which is 0, making 20, for the second partial dividend.
Then, since 23 is contained in 20 no times, we place a cipher in the
quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend, making a
third partial dividend, 207; 23 is contained in 207, 9 times; multiply-
ing and subtracting as before, nothing remains, and the entire quo-
tient is 209.

3. Short Division is generally used when the divisor is a number that will allow
the process of dividing to be performed mentally.
From the preceding illustrations we derive the following
general
Rule. I. Write the divisor at the left of the dividend, as
in short division.
II. Divide the least number of the left hand figures in the
dividend that will contain the divisor one or more times, and
place the quotient at the right of tlie dividend, with a line
"between them.
III. Multiply the divisor by this quotient figure, subtract
the product from the partial dividend used, and to the re-
mainder bring down the next figure of the dividend.
IV. Divide as before, until all the figures of the dividend
have been brought down and divided.
V. If any partial dividend will not contain the divisor,
place a cipher in the quotient, and bring down the next figure
of the dividend, and divide as before.
VL If there be a remainder after dividing all the figures
of the dividend, it must be written in the quotient, with the
divisor underneath.
1. If any remainder be equal to, or greater than the divisor, the quotient figure 1b
too smalls and must be increased.
8. If the product of the divisor by the quotient figure be greater than the partial
dividend, the quotient figure is too large, and mnst be diminished.
79. Proof. 1. The same as in short division. Or,
2. Subtract the remainder, if any, from the dividend, and

the 571 by 8, we have a quotient of 71, and a remainder of 3 undi-
vided. As this 3 is a part of the 571, it must be multiplied by 2 to
change it to the same kind of units as the 1. This makes a true re-
mainder of 6 arising from dividing by 8. Dividing the 71 by 4, we
have a quotient of 17, and a remainder of 3 undivided. This 3 is a part
of the 71, the units of which aie 8 times as great in value as those of
the 571, and the units of the 571 are 2 times as great in value as those
of the given dividend, 1143; therefore, to change this last remainder,
3, to units of the same value as the dividend, we multiply it by 8 and
2, and obtain a true remainder of 48 arising from dividing by 4.
Adding the three partial remainders, we obtain 55, the true remainder.

the right hand figure of a number, each of the other figures is removed
one place toward the right, and, consequently, the value of each is
diminished tenfold, or divided by 10 (32).
For similar reasons, if we cut off two figures, we divide by
100, if three, we divide by 1000, and so on.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION.
86. The quotient in Division depends upon the relative
values of the dividend and divisor. Hence any change in the
-?alue of either dividend or divisor must produce a change
in the value of the quotient. But some changes may be
produced upon both dividend and divisor, at the same time,
that will not affect the quotient. The laws which govern
these changes are called General Principles of Division,
which we will now examine.
I . 54-r-9 = 6.
Multiplying the dividend by 3, we have
54 x 3 -r- 9 = 162 9 = 18,
and 18 equals the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence,
Multiplying the dividend by any number, multiplies the quo-
tient by the same number.
II. Using the same example, 54 -7- 9 = 6.
Dividing the dividend by 3 we have
^--=-9 = 18^-9 = 2,
and 2 — the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Dividing the
dividend by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
III. Multiplying the divisor by 3, we have
54 9 x 3 = 54 + 27 = 2,
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Multiplying
the divisor by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
IV. Dividing the divisor by 3, we have
54 -f-1 = 54 3 = 18,
Upon what does the value of the quotient depend? What is the
first general principle of division? Second? Third? Fourth 1
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION. 65
and 18 = the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence, Divid-
ing the divisor by any number, multiplies the quotient by the
same number.
V. Multiplying both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
54 x 3 4- 9 x 3 = 162 27 = 6.
Hence, Multiplying both dividend and divisor by t?ie same
number, does not alter the value of the quotient.
VI. Dividing both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
Y-M = 18H-3 = 6.
Hence, Dividing both dividend and divisor by the same num-
ber, does not alter the value of the quotient.
87. These six examples illustrate all the different changes
we ever have occasion to make upon the dividend and divi-
sor in practical arithmetic. The principles upon which
these changes are based may be stated as follows:
Phis'. I. Multiplying the dividend multiplies the quotient;
and dividing the dividend divides the quotient. (86.1 and II.)
Prin. II. Multiplying the divisor divides the quotient;
and dividing the divisor multiplies the quotient. (86. Ill
and IV.)
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both dividend and
divisor by the same number, does not alter the quotient. (86.
V and VI.)
88. These three principles may be embraced in one
General Law.
A change in the dividend produces a like change in the
quotient; but a change in the divisor produces an opposite
change in the quotient.
If a number be multiplied aDd the product divided by the Bame number, the quo?
tlent Will be equal to the number multiplied. Thus, 15 x 4=60, and 60-i-4=l6.

condensed? What is the first? Second? Third? In what general
law are these embraced?

PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS.
EXACT DIVISOKS.
89. An Exact Divisor of a number is one that gives
a whole number for a quotient.
As it is frequently desirable to know if a number has an
exact divisor, we will present a few directions that will be
of assistance, particularly in finding exact divisors of large
numbers.
A number whose unit figure is 0, 2,4, 6, or 8, is called an Even Number. And a
comber whose unit figure is 1,3,5,7, or 9, is called an Odd Number.
2 is an exact divisor of all even numbers.
4 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the tens
and units of a number. Thus, 4 is an exact divisor of 268,
756, 1284.
5 is an exact divisor of every number whose unit figure is
0 or 5. Thus, 5 is an exact divisor of 20, 955, and 2840.
8 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the hun-
dreds, tens, and units of a number. Thus, 8 is an exact
divisor of 1728, 5280, and 213560.
9 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the sum of
the digits of a number. Thus, in 2486790, the sum of the
digits 2+4 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 0=36, and 36h-9=4.
10 is an exact divisor when 0 occupies units' place.
100 when 00 occupy the places of units and tens.
1000 when 000 occupy the places of units, tens, and hun-
dreds, etc.
A composite number is an exact divisor of any number,
when all its factors are exact divisors of the same number.
Thus, 2, 2, and 3 are exact divisors of 12; and so also are 4
(=2x2) and 6 (=2x3).
An even number is not an exact divisor of an odd number.
If an odd number is an exact divisor of an even number.
What is an exact divisor? What is an even number? An odd num-
ber? When is 2 an exact divisor? 4? 5? 9? 10? 100? 1000?
When is a composite number an exact divisor? An even number is
not an exact divisor of what? An odd number is an exact divisor of
what?
FACTORING NUMBERS.
67
twice that odd number is also an exact divisor of the even
number. Thus, 7 is an exact divisor of 42 j so also is 7 x 2,
or 14.

operation. Analysis. Divide the given number by 2,
the least prime factor, and the result by 2; this
gives an odd number for a quotient, divisible by
the prime factor, 3, and the quotient resulting
from this division is also divisible by 3. The
next quotient, 77, we divide by its least prime
factor, 7, and obtain the quotient 11; this being
a prime number, the division can not be carried
further. The divisors and last quotient, 2, 2, 3,
3, 7, and 11 are all the prime factors of the given

CANCELLATION.
93. Cancellation is the process of rejecting equal fac-
tors from numbers sustaining to each other the relation of
dividend and divisor.
It has been shown (77) that the dividend is equal to the
product of the divisor multiplied by the quotient. Hence,
if the dividend can be resolved into two factors, one of
which is the divisor, the other factor will be the quotient.

by writing the num-
bers which constitute the dividend above a line, and those which con-
stitute the divisor below it. Instead of multiplying 24 by 56, in the
dividend, we resolve 24 into the factors 4 and 0, and 56 into the factors
7 and 8; and 48 in the divisor into the factors 6 and 8. We next
cancel the factors 6, 7, and 8, which are common to the dividend and
divisor, and wo have left the factor 4 in the dividend, which is the
quotient.
When all the factors or numbers in the dividend are canceled, 1 should be
retained.
95. If any two numbers, one in the dividend and one in
the divisor, contain a common factor, we may reject that
factor.

From the preceding examples and illustrations we derive
the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers composing the dividend above

II. Cancel all the factors common to both dividend and

III. Divide the product of the remaining factors of the
dividend by the product of the remaining factors of the di-
visor, and the result will be the quotient.
1. Rejecting a factor from any number is dividing the number by that (actor.
2. When a factor is canceled, the unit, 1, is supposed to take ite place.
3. One factor in the dividend will cancel only one equal factor in the divisor.
4. If all the factors or numbers of the divisor are canceled, the product of the
remaining factors of the dividend will be the quotient.
5. By many it is thought more convenient to write the factors of the dividend on
the right of a vertical line, and the factors of the divisor on the left.

1. What is the greatest common divisor of 84 and 203?
Analysis. Draw two vertical lines, and
place the larger number on the right, and
the smaller number ou the left, one line
lower down. Then divide 203, the larger
number, by 84, the smaller, and write 2,
the quotient, between the verticals, the
j£ product, 168, opposite, under the greater
number, and the remainder, 35, below.
Next divide 84 by this remainder, writing
the quotient, 2, between the verticals, the
product, 70, on the left, and the new remainder, 14, below the 70.
Again divide the last divisor, 35, by 14, and obtain 2 for a quotient,
28 for a product, and 7 for a remainder, all of which we write in the
same order as in the former steps. Finally, divide the last divisor,
14, by the last remainder, 7, and we have no remainder. 7, the last
divisor, is the greatest common divisor of the given numbers.

will also divide 2 times 35, or 70,
(I;) and since it is a common di-
visor of 70 and 14, it must divide
their sum, 84, which is one of the
given numbers, (II.) It will also
divide 2 times 84, or 168, (I;) and

know that the greatest common divisor, whatever it be, must divide
2 times 84, or 168, (I.) Then
since it will divide both 168 and
203, it must divide their differ-
ence, 35, (III.) It will also divide
2 times 35, or 70, (I;) and as it will
divide both 70 and 84, it must di-
vide their difference, 14, (III.) It
will also divide 2 times 14 or 28,

ence, 7, (III;) hence, it cannot be

Thus we have shown,
1st. That 7 is a common divisor of the given numbers.
2d. That their greatest common divisor, whatever it be,
cannot be greater than 7. Hence it must be 7.
From this example and analysis, we derive the following
Rule. I. Draw two verticals, and write the two numbers,
one on each side, the greater number one line above the less.
II. Divide the greater number by the less, writing the quo-
tient between the verticals, the jjroduct under the dividend,

III. Divide the less number by the remainder, the last di-

The last divisor will be the greatest common divisor sought.
IV. If more than two numbers be given, first find the great-

103. From the definition (100) it is evident that the

Hence, A common multiple of two or more numbers may be
found by multiplying the given numbers together.
104. To find the least common multiple.
First Method.
From the nature of prime numbers we derive the follow-
ing principles:
I. If a number exactly contain another, it will contain all
the prime factors of that number.
II. If a number exactly contain two or more numbers, it
will also contain all the prime factors of those numbers.
III. The least number that will exactly contain all the
prime factors of two or more numbers, is the least common
multiple of those numbers.

factors of 30 except the factor 5. Annexing 5 to the series of factors,
2 x 3 x 13 x 11 x 7 x 5,
and we have all the prime factors of each of the given numbers; and
hence the product of the series of factors is a common multiple of the
given numbers, (II.) And as no factor of this series can be omitted
without omitting a factor of one of the given numbers, the product of
the series is the least common multiple of the given numbers, (III.)
From this example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Resolve the given numbers into their prime
factors.
II. Take all the prime factors of the largest number, and
such prime factors of the other numbers as are not found in
the largest number, and their product will be the least com-
mon multiple.
When a prime factor is repeated in any of the given nnmbers, it must be used as
many times, as a factor of the multiple, as the greatest number of times it appears
in any of the given numbers.

operation. Analysis. First write the
given numbers in a series, with
a vertical line at the \ett.
Since 2 is a factor of some of
the given numbers, it must be
a factor of the least common
multiple sought. Dividing as
many of the numbers as are
divisible by 2, write the quo-
tients and the undivided number, 9, in a line underneath. We now
perceive that some of the numbers in the second line contain the
factor 2; hence the least common multiple must contain another 2,
and we again divide by 2, omitting to write down any quotient when
it is 1. We next divide by 3 for a like reason, and still again by 3.
By this process we have transferred all the factors of each of the
numbers to the left of the vertical; and their product, 36, must be the
least common multiple sought, (104, III.)

Analysts. We read-
ily see that 2 and 5 are
among the factors of the
given numbers, and must
be factors of the least
common multiple; hence
we divide every number
that is divisible by either of these factors or by their product; thus, we
divide 10 by both 2 and 5; 12 by 2; 15 by 5; and 75 by 5. We next
divide the second line in like manner by 2 and 3; and afterwards the
third line by 5. By this process we collect the factors of the given
numbers into groups; and the product of the factors at the left of the
vertical is the least common multiple sought.

Analysis. In this opera-
tion we omit the 6 and 35,
because they are exactly con-
tained in some of the other
3x7x2x5 = 210, Ans. given numbers; thus, 6 is
contained in 42, and 35 in
70; and whatever will contain 42 and 70 must contain 6 and 35.
Hence we have only to find the least common multiple of the remain,
ing numbers, 15, 42, and 70.
From these examples we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers in a line, omitting any of the
smaller numbers that are factors of the larger, and draw a
vertical line at the left.
II. Divide by any prime factor, or factors, that may be con-
tained in one or more of the given numbers, and write the
quotients and undivided numbers in a line underneath, omit-
ting the Vs.
III. In like manner divide the quotients and undivided
numbers, and continue the process till all the factors of the
given numbers have been transferred to the left of the vertical.
Then multiply these factors together, and their product will
be the least common multiple required.

108. III. As Integral and Fractional.
An Integral Number, or Integer, expresses whole
things. Thus, 281; 78 boys; 1000 books.
A Fractional Number, or Fraction, expresses equal
parts of a thing. Thus, half a dollar; three-fourths of an
hour; seven-eighths of a mile.
109. IV. As Abstract and Concrete.
110. V. As Simple and Compound.
A Simple Number is either an abstract number, or a
concrete number of but one denomination. Thus 48, 926;
48 dollars, 926 miles.
A Compound Number is a concrete number whose value
is expressed in two or more different denominations. Thus,
32 dollars 15 cents; 15 days 4 hours 25 minutes; 7 miles
82 rods 9 feet 6 inches.
111. VI. As Like and Unlike.
Like Numbers are numbers of the same unit value.
If simple numbers, they must be all abstract, as 6, 62,
487; or all of one and the same denomination, as 5 apples,
62 apples, 487 apples; and, if compound numbers, tlicy
must be used to express the same kind of quantity, as time,
distance, etc. Thus, 4 weeks 3 days 16 hours; 1 week 6
days 9 hours; 5 miles 40 rods; 2 miles 100 rods.
Unlike Numbers are numbers of different unit values.
Thus, 75, 140 dollars, and 28 miles; 4 hours 30 minutes,
and 5 bushels 1 peck.

112. If a unit be divided into 2 equal parts, one of the
parts is called one-half.
If a unit be divided into 3 equal parts, one of the parts ip
called one-third, two of the parts two-thirds.
If a unit be divided into 4 equal parts, one of, the parts
is called one-fourth^ two of the parts two-fourths, three of
the parts three-fourths.
If a unit be divided into 5 equal parts, one of the parts
Is called one-fifth, two of the parts two-fifths, three of the

Hence we see that the parts into which a unit is divided
take their name, and their value, from the number of equal
parts into which the unit is divided. Thus, if we divide
an orange into 2 equal parts, the parts are called halves;
if into 3 equal parts, thirds j if into 4 equal parts, fourths,
etc.; and each third is less in value than each half, and
each fourth less than each third j and the greater the nwm-
ier of parts, the less their value.
When a unit is divided into any number of equal parts,
one or more such parts is a fractional part of the whole
number, and is called a fraction. Hence,
if 113. A Fraction is one or more of the equal parts of a
unit.

114. To write a fraction, two integers are required, one
to express the number of parts into which the whole num-
ber is divided, and the other to express the number of these
parts taken. Thus, if one dollar be divided into 4 equal
parts,' the parts are called fourths, and three of these parts
are called three-fourths of a dollar. This three-fourths may
be written
3 the number of parts taken.
4 the number of parts into which the dollar is divided.
115. The Denominator is the number below the line.
It denominates or names the parts; and
It shows how many parts are equal to a unit.
116. The Numerator is the number above the line.
It numerates or numbers the parts; and
It shows how many parts are taken or expressed by the
fraction.
117. The Terms of a fraction are the numerator and
denominator, taken together.
118. Fractions indicate division, the numerator answer-
ing to the dividend, and the denominator to the divisor.
119. The Value of a fraction is the quotient of the nu-
merator divided by the denominator.
120. To analyze a fraction is to designate and describe
its numerator and denominator. Thus, £ is analyzed as
follows :—
4 is the denominator, and shows that the integer is divided
into 4 equal parts; it is the divisor.
3 is the numerator, and shows that 3 parts are taken; it
is the dividend, or integer divided.
3 and 4 are the terms, considered as dividend and divisor.
The value of the fraction is the quotient of 3-^4, or £.

A Proper Fraction is one whose numerator is less than
its denominator; its value is less than the unit, 1. Thus,
tV, A, are proper fractions.
An Improper Fraction is one whose numerator equals
or exceeds its denominator; its value is never less than the
unit, 1. Thus, $, -, fj, iffl are improper fractions.
122. A Mixed Number is a number expressed by an in-
teger and a fraction; thus, 4£, 17-J-f, 9^ are mixed numbers.

l-i = H-W = **rFL = -h = ls,Ans. As in whoi„
numbers, we
can subtract numbers only, or those having the same unit value,
so, we can subtract fractions only when they have a common denom-
inator. As f and f have not a common denominator, we first reduce
them to a common denominator, and then subtract the less numerator,
30, from the greater, 32, and write the difference, 2, over the common
denominator, 3(J. We thus obtain J, = -fa, the required difference.

We see in the operation that we have multiplied the dividend by
the denominator of the divisor, and divided the result by the numer-
ator of the divisor, which is in accordance with 140 for dividing a
fraction. Hence, by inverting the terms of the divisor, the two frac-
tions will stand in such relation to each other that we can multiply
together the two upper numbers for the numerator of the quotient,
and the two lower numbers for the denominator, as shown in the
operation. For division of fractions, we have this general
Rule. I. Reduce integers and mixed numbers to improper

DECIMALS.
DECIMAL FRACTIONS.
143. Decimal Fractions are fractions which have for
their denominator 10, 100, 1000, or 1 with any number of
ciphers annexed.
1. The word decimal is derfyed from the Latin decern, which signifies ten.
2. Decimal fractions are commonly called decimals.
8. Since = -tfg, = -j-J^, etc., the denominators of decimal fractions in-
crease and decrease in a tenfold ratio, the same as simple numbers.
Decimal Notation and Numeration.
144. Common Fractions are the common divisions of
a unit into any number of equal parts, as into halves, fifths,
twenty-fourths, etc.
Decimal Fractions are the decimal divisions of a unit,
thus: A unit is divided into ten equal parts, called tenths;
each of these tenths is divided into ten other equal parts,
called hundredths; each of these hundredths into ten other
equal parts, called thousandtlis; and so on. Since the de-
nominators of decimal fractions increase and decrease by the
scale of 10, the same as simple numbers, in writing decimals
the denominators may be omitted.
In simple numbers, the unit, 1, is the starting point of
notation and numeration; and so also is it in decimals. We
extend the scale of notation to the left of units' place in
writing integers, and to the right of units' place in writing
decimals. Thus, the first place at the left of units is tens,
and the first place at the right of units is tenths ; the second
place at the left is hundreds, and the second place at tho
right is hundredths; the third place at the left in thousands,
and the third place at the right is thousandths; and so on.
What are decimal fractions? How do they differ from common
fractions? How are they written t
117
The Decimal Point is a period (.), which must always be
placed before or at the left hand of the decimal. Thus,
-fo is expressed .6
"" -54
tWf" " -279
The decimal point is nlso called the Separatrix. This is a correct name for it
only when it stands between the integral and decimal parts of the same number.
.5 is 5 tenths, which = ^ of 5 units;
.05 is 5 hundredths, "= -jV of 5 tenths;
.005 is 5 thousandths, "= of 5 hundredths.
And universally, the value of a figure in any decimal place
is the value of the same figure in the next left hand place.
The relation of decimals and integers to each other is
clearly shown by the following

dredths 100, of thousands 1000, and so on, a decimal may be
expressed by writing the numerator only; but in this case
the numerator or decimal must always contain as many
decimal places as are equal to the number of ciphers in the
denominator; and the denominator of a decimal will always
be the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as are equal to
the number of figures in the decimal or numerator.
The decimal point must never be omitted.
Examples for Practice.
1. Express in figures thirty-eight hundredths.
2. Write seven tenths.
3. Write three hundred twenty-five thousandths.
4. Write four hundredths. Ans. .04
5. Write sixteen thousandths.
6. Write seventy-four hundred-thousandths. Ans. .00074.
7. Write seven hundred forty-five millionths.
8. Write four thousand two hundred thirty-two ten-thou-
sandths.
9. Write five hundred thousand millionths.

.24 .024 .0005 .001385
.672 .8471 .100248 .1000087
To read a decimal, first numerate from left to right, and the name of the right
hand figure is the name of the denominator. Then numerate from right to left, as
in whole numbers, to read the numerator.
146. A Mixed Number is a number consisting of in-
tegers and decimals; thus, 71.406 consists of the integral
part, 71, and the decimal part, .406; it is read the same as
71tWV, 71 and 406 thousandths.
Examples for Practice.
1. Write eighteen, and twenty-seven thousandths.
2. Write four hundred, and nineteen ten-millionths.
How many decimal places must there be to express any decimal?

81.0001 54.000054 3.03
75.075 9.2806 40.40404
147. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations
ire derive the following important
Principles of Decimal Notation and Numeration.
1. The value of any decimal figure depends upon its place
from the decimal point: thus .3 is ten times .03.
2. Prefixing a cipher to a decimal decreases its value the
Bame as dividing it by ten; thus, .03 is ^ the value of .3.
3. Annexing a cipher to a decimal does not alter its value,
since it does not change the place of the significant figures
of the decimal; thus, or .6, is the same as or .60.
4. Decimals increase from right to left, and decrease from
left to right, in a tenfold ratio; and therefore they may be
added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the same as whole
numbers.
5. The denominator of a decimal, though nevei expressed,
is always the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there
are figures in the decimal.
6. To read decimals requires two numerations; first, from
units, to find the name of the denominator, and second, to-
wards units, to find the value of the numerator.
148. Having analyzed all the principles upon which the
writing and reading of decimals depend, we will now pre-
sent these principles in the form of rules.

operation. Analysis. The given decimals must contain
.50000 as many places each, as are equal to the greatest
37500 number of decimal figures in any of the given
3 25401 decimals. We find that the third number con-
tains five decimal places, and hence 100000 must
be a common denominator. As annexing ciphers
to decimals does not alter their value, (144, 3)
we give to each number five decimal places by annexing ciphers, and
thus reduce the given decimals to a common denominator.
Rule. Give to each number the same number of decimal
places, by annexing ciphers.
1. If the numbers be reduced to the denominator of that one of the given nam
bers having the greatest number of decimal places, they will have their least com.
mon decimal denominator.
2. A whole number may readily be reduced to decimals by placing the decimal
point after units, and annexing ciphers; one cipher reducing it to tenths, two
ciphers to hundredths, three ciphers to thousandths, and so on.

MULTIPLICATION.

operation. Analysis. We perform the multiplication the
.35 same as in whole numbers, and the only difficulty
g we meet with is in pointing off the decimal places
in the product. To determine how many places to
.175, Ans. point off, we may reduce the decimals to common
fractions; thus, .35 = and .5 = -fa. Perform-
ing the multiplication, we have ^ x -fg = JJfo, and this product,
expressed decimally, is .175. Here we see that the product contains
as many decimal places as are contained in both multiplicand and
multiplier.
Rule. Multiply as in whole numbers, and from the right
hand of the product point off as many figures for decimals as
there are decimal places in both factors.

DIVISION.
155. 1. What is the quotient of .175 divided by .5?
operation. Analysis. Performing the division the same as
.5 ) .175 m whole numbers, the only difficulty we meet with
. is in pointing off the decimal places in the quotient.
)1S. .oo To determine how many places to point off, we may
reduce the decimals to common fractions; thus, .175 = -j3^, and
.5 = Performing the division, we have

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
156. Coin is money stamped, and has a given value es-
tablished by law.
157. Currency is coin, bank bills, treasury notes, etc,
in circulation as a medium of trade.
158. A Decimal Currency is a currency whose denom-
inations increase and decrease in a tenfold ratio.
The currency of the United States is decimal currency, and is sometimes called
Federal Money; it was adopted by Congress in 17S6.
NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
BY THE "COINAGE ACT OP 1873."
The Coin of the United States consists of gold, silver,
nickel, and bronze.
T7te Gold Coins are the double-eagle, eagle, half-eagle,
quarter-eagle, three-dollar and one-dollar pieces.
Tlie Silver Coins are the dollar, half-dollar, quarter-dcl-
lar, the twenty-cent, and ten-cent pieces.
TJie Hickel Coins are the five-cent and three-cent pieces.
TJie Bronze Coins are the one-cent pieces.

1. The mill is a denomination used only in computations; it is not a coin.
2. The Irade-doltar (s designed solely for commerce, and not for currency. Its

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
159. The gold dollar is the unit of United States money;
dimes, cents, and mills are fractions of a dollar, and are
separated from the dollar by the decimal point; thus, two
dollars one dime two cents five mills, are written $2,125.
By examining the table, we see that the dime is a tenth
part of the unit, or dollar; the cent a tenth part of the dime
or a hundredth part of the dollar; and the mill a tenth part
if the cent, a hundredth part of the dime, or a thousandth
part of the dollar. Hence the denominations of decimal
currency increase and decrease the same as decimal fractions,
and are expressed according to the same decimal system of
notation; and they may bo added, subtracted, multiplied,
and divided -in the same manner as decimals.
Dimes are not read as dimes, but the two places of dimes
and cents are appropriated to cents; thus, 1 dollar 3 dimes
i cents, or $1.32, are read one dollar thirty-two cents; heDce,
When the number of cents is less than 10, we write a
cipher before it in the place of dimes.
The half cent is frequently written as 5 mills; thns, 24 J cents, written $.243.
160. Business men frequently write cents as common
fractions of a dollar; thus, three dollars thirteen cents are
written §3^$, and read, three and thirteen hundredths
dollars. In business transactions, when the final result of a
computation contains 5 mills or wore, they are called one
cent, and when less than 5, they are rejected.
Examples for Practice.

2. Write two dollars nine cents.
3. Write ten dollars ten cents.

161. By examining the table of Decimal Currency, we
see that 10 mills make one cent, and 100 cents, or 1000
mills, make one dollar; hence,
To change dollars to cents, multiply by 100; that is, annex

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
Rule. Divide as in simple numbers, and place the point
in tlie quotient, as in division of decimals.
1. In business transactions it is never necessary to carry the division farther than
to mills in the quotient.
2. If the dividend will not contain the divisor an exact number of times, ciphers
may be annexed, and the division continued as in division of decimals. In this case
it is always safe to reduce the dividend to mills, or to 3 more decimal places than
the divisor contains, before commencing the division.

172. To find the cost of articles sold by the 100,
or 1000.
1. What cost 475 feet of timber, at $5.24 per 100 feet?
FrRST OPERATION.
$5.24 Analysis. If the price were $5.24 pel
475 foot, the cost of 475 feet would be 475 x
$5.24 = $2489. But since $5.24 is the price
of 100 feet, $2489 is 100 times the true
value. Therefore, to obtain the true value,
we divide $2489 by 100. which we may do

tECOND OPERATION. ANALYSIS. Since 1 foot COSt yjj, or .01,
$5.24 of $5.24, 475 feet will cost or 4.75 times
4 75 $5.24, which is $24.89.
For the same reasoDs, when the price is per thou-
land, we divide the product by 1000, or, which is more
convenient in practice, we rednce the given quantity
to thousands and decimals of a thousand, by pointing
ofl three figurea from the right hand. .
Rule. I. Reduce the given quantity to hundreds and deci-
mals of a hundred, or to thousands and decimals of a thousand.
II. Multiply the price by the quantity, and point off in tlie
result as in multiplication of decimals.
The letter C is used to indicate hundreds, and M to indicate thousands.

REDUCTION.
EEDUCTIOK
175. A Compound Number is a number whose valttG
is expressed in two or more different denominations.
176. Reduction is the process of changing a number
from one denomination to another without altering its value.
Reduction is of two kinds, Descending and Ascending.
177. Reduction Descending is changing a number of
one denomination to another denomination of less unit
value; thus, $1=10 dimes=100 cents=1000 mills.
178. Reduction Ascending is changing a number of one
denomination to another denomination of greater unit value j
thus, 1000 mills=100 cents=10 dimes=$l.
179. A Scale is a series of units, increasing or decreas-
ing, according to a certain law.

the table and denominations are the same as those of the
United States money,
Tho currency of the whole Dominion of Canada was made uniform July 1,1871.
Before the adoption of the decimal system, pounds, shillings, and pence were used.
The Silver Cains are tlie 50-cer.t piece, 25-cent piece, 10-cent piece,
and 5-cent piece. The 20-ccnt piece is no longer coined. The Bronu

Standard of "Weight.
188. In the year 1834 the U. S. government adopted a
uniform standard of weights and measures, for the use of the
custom-houses, and the other branches of business connected
with the general government.
157
189. The United States standard unit of weight is the
Troy pound of the mint, which is the same as the imperial
standard pound of Great Britain, and is determined as fol-
lows : A cubic inch of distilled water* in a vacuum, weighed
by brass weights, also in a vacuum, at a temperature of 62°
Fahrenheit's thermometer, is equal to 252.458 grains, of
which the standard Troy pound contains 5760.
190. The IT. 8. Avoirdupois pound is determined from
the standard Troy pound, and contains 700O Troy grains.
Hence, the Troy pound is 4$t# = of an avoirdupois
pound. But the "Troy ounce contains 6= 480 grains,
and the avoirdupois ounce i j jj° = 437.5 grains; and an ounce
Troy is 480—437.5=42.5 grains greater than an ounce avoir-
dupois. The pound, ounce, and grain, Apothecaries' weight,
are the same as the like denominations in Troy weight, the only
difference in the two tables being in the divisions of the ounce.
191. Comparative Table op Weights.

175 pounds, = 175 pounds, = 144 pounds.
Examples for Practice.

avoirdupois weight, at 50 cents an ounce, and retailed it at
12 cents a dram apothecaries' weight; what did he gain?

1 square foot is a figure having
four sides of 1 ft. or 12 in. each, as
shown in the diagram. Its contents
are 12 x 12 = 144 square inches.
Hence,
The contents or area of a square,
or of any other figure having a uni-
form length and a uniform breadth,
is found by multiplying the length by the breadth. Thus, a
square foot is 12 in. long and 12 in. wide, and the contents
are 12 x 12 = 144 square inches. A board 20 in. long and
10 in. wide is a rectangle, containing 20 x 10 = 200 square
inches.

Analysis. Dividing by the numbers in the ascending scale, and
arranging the remainders according to their order in a line below, we
find the square yards a mixed number, 15 J. But J of a sq. yd. = f of
0 sq. ft. = 6| sq. ft.; and -f of a sq. ft. = f of 144 sq, in. = 108 sq. in.
Therefore -J cq. yd. = 6 sq. ft. 108 sq. in.; and adding 108 sq. in. to
28 sq. in. we have 136 sq. in., and 6 sq. ft. to 7 sq. ft. we have 13 sq.
ft. = 1 sq. yd. 4 sq. ft., and writing the 4 sq. ft. in the result, and

III. Cubic Measure.

198. A Cube is a solid, or body,
having six equal square sides, or
faces. If each side of a cube be 1
yard, or 3 feet, 1 foot in thickness
of this cube will contain 3x3x1
=9 cubic feet, and the whole cube
will contain 3x3x3 = 27 cubic
feet.
A solid, or body, may have the three dimensions all alike
or all different. A body 4 ft. long, 3 ft. wide, and 2 ft. thick
contains 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 cubic or solid feet. Hence,
The cubic or solid contents of a body are found by multi-
plying the length, breadth, and thickness together.
199. Cubic Measure, also called Solid Measure, is used
in estimating the contents of solids, or bodies; as timber,
wood, stone, etc.
Scale—ascending, 1728,27. The other numbers are not in a regular
scale, but are merely so many times 1 foot. The unit equivalents, be-
ing fractional, are consequently omitted.

20?/. Tlie TJ. S. standard unit of measures of extension,
whether linear, superficial, or solid, is the yard of 3 feet, or
36 inches, and is the same as the imperial standard yard of
Great Britain. It is determined as follows: The rod of a
pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time, in the latitude
of London, in a vacuum, at the level of the sea, is divided
into 391393 equal parts, and 360000 of these parts are 36
inches, or 1 standard yard. Hence, such a pendulum rod
is 39.1393 inches long, and the standard yard is jjjj g g g g of
the length of the pendulum rod.
203. The TJ. 8. standard unit of liquid measure is the
vM English wine gallon, of 231 cubic inches, which is equal
to 8.33888 pounds avoirdupois of distilled water at its maxi-

Circular Measure.
207. Circular Measure, or Circular Motion, is used
principally in surveying, navigation, astronomy, and geogra-
phy, for reckoning latitude and longitude, determining loca-
tions of places and vessels, and computing difference of time.
Every circle, great or small, is divisible into the same num-
ber of equal parts, as quarters, called quadrants, twelfths,
called signs, 360ths, called degrees, etc. Consequently tt?,
parts of different circles, although having the same names,
are of different lengths.

If the days of the different months are not the same, the
number of days of difference should be added when the
earlier day belongs to the month from which we reckon, and
subtracted when it belongs to the month to which we find
the time. If the 29th of February is to be included in the
time computed, one day must be added to the result.

operation. Analysis. In 8 fields are 8 times as much
A. P. land as in 1 field. We -write the multiplier
4 107 Tinder the lowest denomination of the multi-
8 plicand, and proceed thus: 8 times 107 P.
are 856 P., equal to 5 A. 56 P.; and we
^ ^ write the 56 P. under the number multiplied.
Again, 8 times 4 A. are 32 A., and 5 A. added make 37 A., which we
write under the same denomination in the multiplicand, and the work
is done.

operation. Analysis. One acre will produce J
bu. pk. qt. pts. as much as 4 acres. Writing the divi-
4 ) 102 3 2 s°r on the left of the dividend, we di-
~ ~ ~ ~ vide 102 bu. by 4, and obtain a quotient
of 26 bu., and a remainder of 2 bu. We
write the 25 bu. under the denomination of bushels, and reduce the
2 bu. to pecks, making 8 pk., and the 3 pk. of the dividend added
makes 11 pk. Dividing 11 pk. by 4, we obtain a quotient of 2 pk.
and a remainder of 3 pk.; writing the 2 pk. under the order of pecks,
we next reduce 3 pk. to quarts, adding the 2 qt. of the dividend, mak-
ing 26 qt., which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 6 qt. and a remainder
of 2 qt. Writing the 6 qt. under the order of quarts, and reducing the
remainder, 2 qt., to pints, we have 4 pt., which divided by 4 gives a
quotient of 1 pt., which we write under the order of pints, and the
work is done.

equal parts, called degrees.
Since the sun appears to pass from east to west round the -
earth, or through 360°, once in every 24 hours, it will pass

we multiply 16° 27', the difference in longitude, by 4, and we obtain
the difference of time in minutes and seconds, which, reduced to higher
denominations, gives 1 h. 5 min. 48 sec, the difference in time.
Rule. Multiply the difference of longitude in degrees and
minutes by 4, and the product will be the difference of time in
minutes and seconds, which may be reduced to hours.
If one place be in east, and the other in west longitude, the difference of longitude
is found by adding them, and if the sum be greater than 180°, it mast be subtracted
from 360°.
Examples for Practice.
2. New York is 74° 1' and Cincinnati 84° 24' west longi-
tude ; what is the difference of time? Ans. 41 min. 32 sec.

Since the sun appears to move from east to west, when it is exactly 12 o'clock at
one place, it will be past 13 o'clock at all places east, and before 12 at all places west.
Hence, knowing the difference of time between two places, and the exact time at
one of them, the exact time at the other will be found by adding their duTeience to

DUODECIMALS.
221. Duodecimals are the divisions and subdivisions of
a unit, resulting from continually dividing by 12, as, jfa,
Y^-g! etc. In practice, duodecimals are applied to the meas-
urement of extension, the foot being taken as the unit
.
If the foot be divided into 12 equal parts, the parts are
called inches, or primes; the inches divided by 12 give sec-
onds; the seconds divided by 12 give thirds; the thirds
divided by 12 give fourths; and so on.
From these divisions of a foot it follows that
1' (Inch or Prime) is of a foot.
1" (Second) or ^ of ^ " of a foot.
1"' (Third) or ^ of ^ of ^ - -" of a foot-

Duodecimals are really common fractions, and can always bo treated as such; bat
usually their denominators are not expressed, and they are treated as compound
numbers.
Addition and Subtraction of Duodecimal

estimate it to be 5 times, and multiplying the divisor by this quotient
figure, we have 18 ft. 9', which, subtracted from 20 ft. 11', leaves
2 ft. 2', to which we bring down 3", the last term of the dividend. We
next seek how many times the divisor is contained in this remainder,

PERCENTAGE.
231. Per cent, is a term derived from the Latin words
per centum, and signifies by the hundred, or hundredths,
that is, a certain number of parts of each one hundred parts,
of whatever denomination. Thus, by 5 per cent. is meant 5
cents of every 100 cents, $5 of every $100, 5 bushels of every
100 bushels, etc. Therefore, 5 per cent. equals 5 hundredths
=.05=14ir=?1!r. 8 per cent. equals 8 hundredths=.08=
232. Percentage is such a part of a number as is indi-
cated by the per cent.
233. The Base of percentage is the number on which
the percentage is computed.
234. Since per cent. is any number of hundredths, it is
usually expressed in the form of a decimal; but it may be
expressed either as a decimal or a common fraction, as in
the following

merchandise, after deducting his commission of 5 per cent.;
what is the sum invested, and how much is the commission?
OPERATION.
$1260 -f- 1.05 = $1200, invested.
$1260 — $1200 = $60, commission. ^
Or, m + tIt = I*; $1260 = $1200, invested;
And $1260 — $1200 = $60, commission.
Case II Li what? Give explanation. Rule.
215
Analysis. Since the commission is 5 per cent., the agent must
receive $ 1.05 for every $1 he expends; he can invest as many dollars
as $1.05 is contained times in $1260, which is $1200; and the differ-
ence between the given sum and the sum invested is his commission.
Or, the money expended is of itself, the commission is of
this sum, and the commission added to the sum expended is of
the whole sum. Since $1260 is = fj, $1260 •«- f£ = $1200, the
sum expended; and $1260 — $1200 = $60 the commission.
Rtjle. I. Divide the given amount by 1 increased by tht
rate per cent, of commission, and the quotient is the sum
invested.

PERCENTAGE.
264. Federal or United States Securities * are of two
kinds; viz., Bonds and Notes.
Bonds are of two kinds.
First, Those which are payable at a fixed date, and are
known and quoted in commercial transactions by the rate
of interest they bear, thus: U. S. 3's, that is, United Statee
Bonds bearing 3% interest.
Second, Those which are payable at a fixed date, b :1
which may be paid at an earlier specified time, as the Gov-
ernment may elect. These are known and quoted in com-
mercial transactions by a combination of the two dates,
thus: U. S. 5-20's; or a combination of the rate of inter-
est and the two dates, thus: IT. S. 6's 5-20; that is, bonds
bearing &% interest, which are payable in twenty years, but
may be paid in five years, if the Government so elect.
When it is necessary, in any transaction, to distinguish
from each other different issues which bear the same rate of
interest, this is done by adding the year in which they be-
come due, thus: U. S. 5's of '71; U. S. 5's of '74; TJ. S. 4's
of 1907, etc.
U. S. Notes are payable on demand, without interest, and
are known as United States Legal-tender Notes, or, in
common language, "Greenbacks."
The nomenclature here explained is that used in com-
mercial transactions, which involve similar Securities of
States or Corporations.
The interest on all U. S. bonds, except the Pacific R. R
6's, is payable in gold.
* Though many of the earlier classes of U. S. securities have been
refunded, a full statement of this subject is considered essential to an
understanding of the history of those securities which at present rep-
resent our public debt.
What are United States Securities composed of? Explain the dif-
ferent kinds of bonds. Of Notes. In what is the interest on each
payable?

The following are the principal United States Securities
which have been issued since 1860:

U S. 10-40's, due 1874-1904, int. 5%.
Pacific Railroad 6's of 1895.
Pacific Railroad 6's of 1896.
1. The 5 20's were issued in 1862, '64, '65, '67, and '70. They bore
interest at 6%, payable semi-annually or quarterly in gold.
2. Bonds issued by States, cities, etc.. are quoted in a similar man-
ner. Thus, 8. C. 6's are bonds bearing 6$ interest, issued by the
State of South Carolina.
3. Most of the above named U. S. bonds have been refunded in the
issues which bear 4J, 4, and 3% interest, but there are several millions
of the earlier issues still outstanding, though the Government has
ceased to pay interest on them.

GOLD INVESTMENTS.
26i). Currency is a term used ia commercial language,
First, To denote the aggregate of Specie and Bills of Exchange,
Bank Bills, Treasury Notes, and other substitutes for money employed
in buying, selling, atd carrying on exchange of commodities between
various nations.
Second, To denote whatever circulating medium is used in any
country as a substitute for the government standard.
In this latter sense, the paper circulating medium, when below pai
"a called Currency, to distinguish it from gold and silver. If, from
any cause, the paper medium depreciates in value, as it has done in
the United States, gold becomes an object of investment, the same as
stocks. In commercial language, gold is represented as rising and
falling; but gold being the standard of value, it cannot vary. The
variation is in the medium of circulation substituted for gold; hence,
when gold is said to be at a premium the currency, or circulating
medium is made the standard, while it is virtually below par.
Note. —The following examples may be omitted by those who pre-
fer to do so, since they have not the same practical value which they
had before the resumption of specie payments in 1879. A knowledge
of the subject of gold investments is necessary to the understanding
of some old accounts and a number of decisions of the U. S. Courts.
Case I.
270. To change gold into currency.

be as many times $1.70 of currency
bought as there are dollars of gold. Therefore, $1.70 x 150 = $255
S3 the amount of currency which can be purchased for $150 in gold.
Rule. Multiply the value of one dollar of gold in currency

Case II is what? Give explanation. Rule.
OPERATION.
40 — 32 = 8; 8 32 = & = .25, Ans.
Or, 40 — 32 = 8; 8 -T- 32 = J x 100 = 25%.
Analysis. Since the gain on 32 cents is 40 — 32 = 8 cents, the
whole gain is T*y = \ of the purchase money ; and J reduced to a
decimal is 25 hundredths, equal to 25 per cent. Or, if the gain were
equal to the purchase money, it would be 100 per cent. ; but since the
gain is = \ of the purchase money, it will be*| of 100 per cent
equal to 25 per cent.
Rule. Make the difference between the purchase and selling
prices the numerator, and the purchase price the denomina-
tor; reduce to a decimal, and the result will be the per cent.
Or, Take such apart of 100 as the gain or loss is part of
the purchase price.

1. A merchant sold cloth for $4.80 a yard, and by so doing
made 33$ per cent.; how much did it cost?
OPERATION.
1 + .33$ = 1.33$; $4.80 H- 1.33$ = $3.60, Ans.
Or, $4.80 = $ of the cost; $4.80 -r-$ = $3.60.
Case IV is what V
PERCENTAGE.
Analysis. Since the gain is 33J per cent, of the cost, $1 of the
cost, increased by 83J- per cent., will be what $1 of cost gold for;
therefore there will be as many dollars of cost, as 1.33J is contained
times in $4.80, or $8.00. Or, since he gained 33J per cent. = -J- of the
cost, $4.80 is f of the cost; $4.80 J = $3.60.
If the rate per cent, be loss, subtract it from 1, instead of adding it.
Rule. Divide the selling price by 1 increased by the gain
or diminished by the loss per cent., expressed decimally, or in
the form of a common fraction, and the quotient will be the
cost.

INSURANCE.
277. Insurance on property is security guaranteed by
one party to another, for a stipulated sum, against the loss
of that property by fire, navigation, or any other casualty.
278. The Insurer or Underwriter is the party taking
ihe risk.
279. The Insured is the party protected.
280. The Policy is the written contract between the
parties.
281. The Premium is the sum paid by the insured to
the insurer, and is estimated at a certain rate per cent. of
the amount insured, which rate varies according to the
degree of hazard, or class of risk.
As a security against fraud, most insurance companies take risks at not more
than two-thirds the full value of the property insured.

TAXES.
283. A Tax is a sum of money assessed on the person
cr property of an individual, for public purposes.
284. When a tax is assessed on property, it is apportioned
at a certain per cent, on the estimated value.
When assessed on the person, it is apportioned equally
among the male citizens liable to assessment, and is called
a poll tax. Each person so assessed is called a poll.

285. Property is of two kinds—real estate, and per-
sonal property.
286. Real Estate consists of immovable property, such
as lands, houses, etc.
287. Personal Property consists of movable property,
su3h as money, notes, furniture, cattle, tools, etc.
288. An Inventory is a written list of articles of prop
erty, with their value.
289. Before taxes are assessed, a complete inventory of
all the taxable property upon which the tax is to be levied
must be made. If the assessment include a poll tax, then
a complete list of taxable polls must also be made out. -
I. A tax of $3165 is to be assessed on a certain town;
the valuation of the taxable property, as shown by the
assessment roll, is $600,000, and there are 220 polls to be
assessed 75 cents each; what will be the tax on a dollar, and
how much will bo A's tax, whose property is valued at $3750,
and who pays for 3 polls?
OPERATION.
$.75 x 230 = $103, amount assessed on the polls.
$3105 — $loj = $3000, amount to be assessed on the property.
$3000 $600,000 = .005, tax on $1.
$3750 x .00.5 = $18.75, A's tax on property.
$.75 x 3 = $2.25, A's tax on 3 polls.
$18.75+ $3.25 = $21, amount of A's tax.
Rule. I. Find the amount of poll tax, if any, and sub-
tract this sum from the whole amount of tax to be assessed.
II. Divide the sum to be raised on property, by the whole
amount of taxable property, and the quotient will be the per
cent., or the tax on one dollar.
III. Multiply each man's taxable property by the per cent.,
or the tax on $1, and to the product add his poll tax, if any j
the result will be the whole amount of his tax.
What is real estate? Personal property? An inventory? Explain
the process of levying a state or other tax. Rule.
PERCENTAGE.
Having found the tax on $1, or the per cent., which in the preceding example we
find to be 5 mills, or -g- per cent., the operation of assessing taxes may be greatly
facilitated by finding the tax on $2, $3, etc., to $10, and then on $90, $90, etc., to
$100, and arranging the numbers as in the following

CUSTOM-HOUSE BUSINESS.
290. Duties, or Customs, are taxes levied on imported
goods, for the support of government and the protection of
home industry.
291. A Custom-House is an office established by gov-
ernment for the transaction of business relating to duties.

293. Tonnage is a tax levied upon a vessel, independent
of its cargo, for the privilege of coming into a port of entry.
294. Revenue is the income to government from duties
and tonnage.
Duties are of two kinds—ad valorem and specific.
295. Atl "Valorem Duty is a sum computed on the cost
of goods in the country from which they were imported.
296. SpeciGc Duty is a sum computed on the weight
or measure of goods, without regard to their cost.
297. An Invoice is a bill of goods imported, showing
the quantity and price of each kind.
298. By the New Tariff Act, approved March 2, 1857,
all duties taken at the U. S. custom-houses, are ad valorem.
In collecting customs, it is the design of government to
tax only so much of the merchandise as will be available to
the importer in the market. The goods are weighed, meas-
ured, gauged, or inspected, in order to ascertain the actual
quantity and value received in port; and an allowance i3
made in every case of waste, loss, or damage.
299. Tare is an allowance of the weight of the package
or covering that contains the goods. It is ascertained by
actually weighing one or more of the empty boxes, casks,
or coverings. In common articles of importation, it is
sometimes computed at a certain per cent. previously ascer-
tained by frequent trials.
300. Leakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
casks or barrels.
301. Breakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
bottles.
Actual leakage or breakage is allowed, there being no fixed or legal rate.
302. Gross Weight or Value is the weight or value of
the goods before any allowance has been made.

311. To find the interest on any sum, at any rate
per cent., for years and months.
241
In percentage, any per cent. of any given number is so
many hundredths of that number; but in interest, any rate
per cent. is confined to 1 year, and the per cent. to be ob-
tained of any given number is greater than the rate per cent.
per annum if the time be more than 1 year, and less than the
rate per cent. per annum if the time be less than 1 year.
Thus, the interest on any sum, at any rate per cent., for 3
j jars 6 months, is 3^ times the interest on the same sum
for 1 year; and the interest for 3 months is \ of the interest
foi 1 year.

SIMPLE INTEREST.
Contractions. After removing the separatrix in the principal, two
places to the left, the result may be regarded either aa the interest on
the given principal for 12 months at 1 per cent., or for 1 month at 12
per cent. If we regard it as for 1 month at 12 per cent., and if the
given rate be an aliquot part of 12 per cent., the interest on the given
principal for 1 month may readily be found by taking such an aliquot
part of the interest for 1 mouth as the given rate is part of 12 per
cent. Thus,
To find the interest for 1 month at 6 per cent., remove the separs
trix two places to the left, and divide by 2.
To find it at 3 per cent., proceed as before, and divide by 4; at 4 pet
cent., divide by 3; at 2 per cent., divide by 6, etc.
Sir Per Cent. Method.
313. By referring to 309 it will be seen that the legal
rate of interest in 21 States is 6 per cent. This is a sufficient
reason for introducing the following brief method into thia
work:
Analysis. At 6 per cent, per annum the interest on $1
For 12 months is $.00.
"2 months (Tss = J of 12 mo.) ".01.
"1 month, or 30 days (T'j of 12 mo.).." .00^ = $,006 of $.06).
"0 days (J of 30 days) ".001.
"1 " (J of 6 da. = ^ of 30 days).." .000J.
Hence we conclude that,
1st. The interest on $1 is $.005 per month, or $.01 for
every 2 months;
2d. The interest on $1 is $.000| per day, or $.001 for
every 6 days.
From these principles we deduce the
Rule. I. To find the rate :—Call every year $.06, every
2 months $.01, every 6 days $.001, and every less number of
days sixths of 1 mill.
II. To find the interest:—Multiply the principal by flu
rate.
1. To find the interest at any other rate per cent, by this method, first find it at
6 per cent., and then increase or diminish the result by as many times itBelf as the

method. Eule. Its application to any other rate per cent.
given rate id greater or less than 6 per cent. Thus, for 7 per cent, add J, for 4 per
cent, subtract ^, etc.
2. The interest of $10 for 6 days, or of $1 for 60 days, is $.01. Therefore, if the
principal be less than $10 and the time less than 6 days, or the principal less than
$1 and the time less than 60 days, the interest will be less than $.01, and may be
disregarded.
3. Since the interest of $1 for 60 days, is $.01, the interest of $1 for any number
of days is as many cents as 60 is contained times in the number of days. Therefore,
if any principal be multiplied by the number of days in any given number of months
and days, and the product divided by 60, the result will be the interest in cents.
That is, Multiply the principal by the number of days, divide the product by 60, and
point off two decimal places in the quotient. The result will be the interest in the
same denomination as the principal.

COMPOUND INTEREST.
324. Compound Interest is interest on both principal
and interest, when the interest is not paid when due.
The simple interest may be added to the principal annually, semi-annually, or
quarterly, as the parties may agree; but the taking of compound interest is not
legal.

specified time.
329. Bank Notes, or Bank Bills, are the notes made
and issued by banks to circulate as money. They are pay-
able in specie at the banks.
330. The Face of a note is the sum made payable by
the note.
331. Days of Grace are the three days usually allowed
by law for the payment of a note after the expiration of the
time specified in the note.
332. The Maturity of a note is the expiration of the
days of grace; a note is due at maturity.
333. Notes may contain a promise of interest, which will
be reckoned from the date of the note, unless some other
time be specified.
The transaction of borrowing money at banks is conducted
in accordance with the following custom: the borrower pre-
sents a note, either made or indorsed by himself, payable at
a specified time, and receives for it a sum equal to the face,
less the interest for the time the note has to run. The
amount thus withheld by the bank is in consideration of
advancing money on the note prior to its maturity.
334. Bank Discount is an allowance made to a bank
for the payment of a note before it becomes due.

EXCHANGE.
338. Exchange is a method of remitting money from
one place to another, or of making payments by written
orders.
339. A Bill of Exchange is a written request or. order
upon one person to pay a certain sum to another person, or
to his order, at a specified time.
340. A Sight Draft or Bill is one requiring payment to
be made "at sight," which means, at the time of its presenta-
tion to the person ordered to pay. In other bills, the time
specified is usually a certain number of days "after sight."
There are always three parties, and usually four, to a
transaction in exchange.
341. The Drawer or Maker is the person who signs
the order or bill.
Give the rale. Define exchange. A hill of exchange, A sight
draft. Tlie drawer.
EXCHANGE.
267
342. The Drawee is the person to -whom the order is
addressed.
343. The Payee is the person to whom the money is
ordered to be paid.
344. The Buyer or Remitter is the person who pur-
chases the bill. He may be himself the payee, or the bill
may be drawn in favor of any other person.
345. The Indorsement of a bill is the writing upon its
back, by which the payee relinquishes his title, and transfers
the payment to another. The payee may indorse in blank
by writing his name only, which makes the bill payable to
the bearer, and consequently transferable like a bank note;
or he may accompany his signature by a special order to pay
to another person, who in his turn may transfer the title in
like manner. Indorsers become separately responsible for
the amount of the bill, in case the drawee fails to make pay-
ment. A bill made payable to the bearer is transferable
without indorsement.
346. The Acceptance of a bill is the promise which the
drawee makes when the bill is presented to him to pay it at
maturity; this obligation is usually acknowledged by writ-
ing the word "Accepted," with his signature, across the
face of the bill.
Three days of grace are usually allowed for the payment of a bill of exchange
after the time specified has expired. But in New York State no grace is allowed on
sight drafts.
From these definitions, the use of a bill of exchange in
monetary transactions is readily perceived. If a man wishes
to make a remittance to a creditor, agent, or any other per-
son residing at a distance, instead of transporting specie,
which is attended with expense and risk, or sending bank
notes, which are liable to be uncurrent at a distance from
the banks that issue them, he remits a bill of exchange,
purchased at a bank or elsewhere, and made payable to tra

proper person in or near the place where he resides. Thus
a man by paying Boston funds in Boston, may put New
"York funds into the hands of his New York agent.
347. The Course of Exchange is the variation of the
cost of sight bills from their par value, as affected by the rela-
tive conditions of trade and commercial credit at the two
places between which exchange is made. It may be either at
& premium or discount, and is rated at a certain per cent. on
the face of the bill. Bills payable a specified time after sight
are subject to discount, like notes of hand, for the term of
credit given. Hence their value in the money market is
affected by both the course of exchange and the discount
for time.
348. Foreign Exchange relates to remittances made
between different countries.
349. Domestic or Inland Exchange relates to remit-
tances made between different places in the same country.
An inland bill of exchange is commonly called a Draft.
In this work we shall treat only of Inland Exchange.

received in Philadelphia, is accepted, and paid after the ex-
piration of the three days of grace. If the manufacturer
immediately puts this money at interest at the legal rate,
will he gain or lose by the blunder of his agent?
Ans. He will lose $1.90.
EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
352. Equation of Payments is the process of finding
the mean or equitable time of payment of several sums, due
at different times without interest.
353, The Term of Credit is the time to elapse before a
debt becomes due.
Rule. Define equation of payments. Term of credit.
EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
354. The Average Term of Credit is the time to elapse
before several debts, due at different times, may all be paid
at once, without loss to debtor or creditor.
355. The Equated Time is the date at which the sev-
eral debts may be canceled by one payment.
Case I.
356. "When all the terms of credit begin at the
same date.
1. On the first day of January I find that I owe Mr.
Smith 8 dollars, to be paid in 5 months, 10 dollars to be
paid in 2 months, and 12 dollars to be paid in 10 months;
at what time may I pay the whole amount?
OPERATION.
$ 8 x 5 = 40
10 x 2 = 20
12 x 10 = 120
30 180 -5- 30 = 6 mo., average time cf credit.
Jan. 1+6 mo. = July 1, equated time of payment.
Analysis. The whole amount to be paid, as seen above, is $30;
and we are to find how long it shall be withheld, or what term of
credit it shall have, as an equivalent for the various terms of credit
on the different items. Now the value of credit on any sum is meas-
ured by the product of the money and time. And we say, the credit
on $8 for 5 mo. = the credit on $40 for 1 mo., because 8 x 5 = 40 x 1.
In the same manner, we have, the credit on $10 for 2 mo. = the credit
on $20 for 1 mo.; and the credit on $12 for 10 mo. = the credit on $120
for 1 mo. Hence, by addition, the value of the several terms of credit
on their respective sums equals a credit of 1 month on $180; and thk
equals a credit of 6 months on $30, because
30 x 6 = 180 x 1.
Rule. I. Multiply each payment by its term of credit,
and divide the sum of the products by the sum of the pay-
ments; the quotient ivill be the average term of credit.

AVERAGING CREDITS.
273
II. Add the average term of credit to the date at which all
the credits begin, and the result will be the equated time of
payment.
1. The periods of time used as multipliers must all be of the same denomination,
and the quotient will be of the same denomination as the terms of credit; if these
be months, and there be a remainder after the division, continue the division to
days by reduction, always taking the nearest unit in the last result.
2. The several rules in equation of payments are based upon the principle of bank
discount; for they imply that the discount of a sum paid before it is due equals the
ixterest of the some amount paid after it is due.
Examples for Practice.
2. On the 25th of September a trader bought merchandise,

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
359. The Items of an account may be sums due at the
date of the transaction, or on credit for a specified time.
An account may have both a debit and a credit side, the
former marked Dr., the latter Cr. Suppose A and B have
dealings in which there is an interchange of money or prop-
erty; A keeps the account, heading it with B's name; the
Dr. side of the account shows what B has received from A;
the Cr. side shows what he has parted with to A.
360. The Balance of account is the difference of the
two sides, and may be in favor of either party.
If, in the transactions, one party has received nothing from
the other, the balance is simply the whole amount, and the
account has but one side. Bills of purchase are of this class.
Book accounts bear interest after the expiration of the term of credit, and notes
after they become due.

275
Analysis. By reference to the example, it will be seen that the
items are due June 1, Oct. 13, and Aug. 10, as shown in the two opera-
tions. In the first operation we use the earliest date, June 1, as a focal
date, and find the difference in days between this date and each of the
others, regard being had to the number of days in calendar months.
From June 1 to Oct. 12 is 133 da.; from June 1 to Aug. 16 is 76 da.
Hence the first item has no credit from June 1, the second item has
133 days' credit from June 1, and the third item has 76 days' credii
from June 1, as appears in the column marked da. After this we pro-
ceed precisely as in Case I, and find the average credit, 71 da., and
the equated time, Aug. 11.
In the second operation, the latest date, Oct. 13, is taken for a focal
date; the work is explained thus: Suppose the account to be settled
Oct. 12. At that time the first item has been due 133 days, and must
therefore draw interest for this time. But interest on g450 for 133
days = the interest on $59850 for 1 da. The second item draws no
interest, because it falls due Oct. 12. The third item must draw inter-
est 57 days. But interest on $250 for 57 days = the interest on $14250
for 1 day. Taking the sum of the products, we find the whole amount
of interest due on the account, at Oct. 12, equals the interest on $74100
for 1 day; and this, by division, is found to be equal to the interest on
$1200 for G2 days, which time is the average term of interest. Hence
the account would be settled Oct. 12, by paying $1200 with interest on
the same for 02 days. This shows that $1200 has been due 03 days;
that is, it falls due Aug. 11, without interest.
Rule. I. Find the time at which each item becomes due,
by adding to the date of each transaction the term of credit,
if any be specified, and write these dates in a column.
II. Assume either the earliest or the latest date for a focal
date, and find the difference in days between the focal date
and each of the other dates, and write the results in a second
column.
III. Write the items of the account in a third column, and
multiply each sum by the corresponding number of days in the
preceding column, writing the products in a final column.
IV. Divide the sum of the products by the sum of the items.
The quotient loill be the average term of credit when the

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
Analysis. In the above operation we have written the dates,
showing when the items become due on either side of the account,
adding 3 days' grace to the time allowed to the draft. The latest
date, Oct. 20, is assumed as the focal date for both sides, and the two
columns marked da. show the difference in days between each date
and the focal date. The products are obtained as in the last ease, and
a balance is struck between the items charged and the products.
These balances, being on the Dr. side, show that David Ware, on the
day of the focal date, Oct. 20, owes $600 with interest on $35450 for
1 day. By division, this interest is found to be equal to the interest
on $600 for 59 days. The balance, $600, therefore, has been due 59
days. Reckoning back from Oct. 20, we find the date when the bal-
ance fell due, Aug. 22.
Rule. I. Find the time when each item of the account is
due; and write the dates, in two columns, on the sides of the
account to which they respectively belong.
II. Use either the earliest or the latest of these dates as the
focal date for both sides, and find the products as in the last
case.
III. Divide the balance of the products by the balance of
the account; the quotient will be the interval of time, which
must be reckoned from the focal date toward the other dates
when both balances are on the same side of the account, but
from the other dates when the balances are on opposite sides
of the account.

RATIO.
364. Ratio is the comparison with each other of two
numbers of the same kind. It is of two kinds—arithmetical
and geometrical.
365. Arithmetical Ratio is the difference of the two
numbers.
366. Geometrical Ratio is the quotient of one num-
ber divided by the other.
367. When we use the word ratio alone, it implies geo-
metrical ratio, and is expressed by the quotient arising from
dividing one number by the other. Thus, the ratio of 4 to 8
is 2, of 10 to 5 is etc.
368. Ratio is indicated in two ways.
1st. By placing two points between the numbers com-
pared, writing the divisor before and the dividend after the
points. Thus, the ratio of 5 to 7 is written 5:7; the ratio
of 9 to 4 is written 9 : 4.
2d. In the form of a fraction; thus, the ratio of 9 to 3
is J; the ratio of 4 to 6 is J.
369. The Terms are the two numbers compared.
370. The Antecedent is the first term.
371. The Consequent is the second term.
372. No comparison of two numbers can be fully ex-
plained but by instituting another comparison; thus, the
It Is thought beet to omit the questions at the bottom of the pages la the remain-
ing part of this work, leaving the teacher to use such as may be deemed appropriatO.
comparison or relation of 4 to 8 cannot be fully expressed
by 2, nor of 8 to 4 by If the question were asked, what
relation 4 bears to 8, or 8 to 4, in respect .to magnitude, the
answer 2, or would not be complete nor correct. But if
we make unity the standard of comparison, and use it as
one of the terms in illustrating the relation of the two
numbers, and say that the ratio or relation of 4 to 8 is the
Bame as 1 to 2, or the ratio of 8 to 4 is the same as 1 to
unity in both cases being the standard of comparison, then
the whole meaning is conveyed.
373. A Direct Ratio arises from dividing the conse-
quent by the antecedent.
374. An Inverse or Reciprocal Ratio is obtained by
dividing the antecedent by the consequent. Thus, the direct
ratio of 5 to 15 is = 3; and the inverse ratio of 5 to 15
is A = h
375. A Simple Ratio consists of a single couplet; as
3 :12.
376. A Compound Ratio is the product of two or more
simple ratios. Thus, the compound ratio formed from the
simple ratios of 3 : 6 and 8:2is$x|=3x8:6x2 =
H = i
377. In comparing numbers with each other, they must
be of the same kind, and of the same denomination.
378. The ratio of two fractions is obtained by dividing
the second by the first; or by reducing them to a common
denominator, when they are to each other as their numera-
tors. Thus, the ratio oiI :$ is $ -f- ^ = = 2, which is
the same as the ratio of the numerator 3 to the numerator
6 of the equivalent fractions and -fo.
Since the antecedent is a divisor and the consequent a divi-
dend, any change in either or both terms will be governed by
the general principles of division, ( 87.) We have only to
substitute the terms antecedent, consequent, and ratio, for
divisor, dividend, and quotient, and these principles become
281
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIO.
Prin. I. Multiplying the consequent multiplies the ratio;
dividing the consequent divides the ratio.
Prin. II. Multiplying the antecedent divides the ratio;
dividing the antecedent multiplies the ratio.
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both antecedent and
consequent by the same number does not alter the ratio.
These *hree principles may be embraced in one
General Law.
A change in the consequent produces a like change in
the ratio; but a change in the antecedent produces an
opi osite change in the ratio.
379. Since the ratio of two numbers is equal to the con-
sequent divided by the antecedent, it follows, that
1. The antecedent is equal to the consequent divided by
the ratio; and that,
2. The consequent is equal to the antecedent multiplied
by the ratio.

2d. By the sign of equality placed between the two ratios;
Jhus, 2 :5 = 4:10.
382. Since each ratio consists of two terms, every pro-
portion must consist of at least four terms.
383. The Extremes are the first and fourth terms.
384. The Means are the second and third terms.
385. Three numbers may be in proportion when the first
is to the second as the second is to the third. Thus, the
numbers 3, 9, and 27 are in proportion since 3 : 9 :: 9:27,
the ratio of each couplet being 3.
In such a proportion the second term is said to be a mean
'proportional between the other two.
386. In every proportion the product of the extremes is
equal to the product of the means. Thus, in the proportion
3 : 5 :: 6 :10 we have 3 x 10 = 5 x 6.
SIMPLE PROPORTION.

387. Pour numbers that are proportional in the direct
order are proportional by inversion, and also by alternation,
or by inverting the means. Thus, the proportion 2:3::
6 : 9, by inversion becomes 3 : 2 :: 9 : 6, and by alterna-
tion 2 : 6 :: 3 : 9.
388. From the preceding principles and illustrations, it
follows that, any three terms of a proportion being given-
the fourth may readily be found by the following
Rule. I. Divide the product of the extremes by one of the
means, and the quotient will be the other mean. Or,
II. Divide the product of the means by one of the extremes,
and the quotient will be the other extreme.

SIMPLE PROPORTION.
389. Simple Proportion is an equality of two simplt-
ratios, and consists of four terms, any three of which being
given, the fourth may readily bo found.
390. Every question in simple proportion involves the
principle of cause and effect.
391. Causes may be regarded as action, of whatever
kind, the producer, the consumer, men, animals, time, dis-
tance, weight, goods bought or sold, money at interest, etc.
PROPOKTIOK.
392. Effects may be regarded as whatever is accom-
plished by action of any kind, the thing produced or con-
sumed, money paid, etc.
393. Causes and effects are of two kinds—simple and
compound.
394. A Simple Cause, or Effect, contains but one ele-
ment; aa goods purchased or sold, and the money paid or
received for them.
395. A Compound Cause, or Effect, is the product ot
two or more elements; as men at work taken in connection
with time, and the result produced by them taken in con-
nection with dimensions, length and breadth, etc.
396. Causes and effects that admit of computation, that
is, involve the idea of quantity, may be represented by num-
bers, which will have the same relation to each other as the
things they represent. And since it is a principle of philoso-
phy that like causes produce like effects, and that effects are
always in proportion to their causes, we have the following
proportions:
1st Cause : 2d Cause :: 1st Effect : 2d Effect.
Or, 1st Effect : 2d Effect :: 1st Cause : 2d Cause;
in which the two causes, or the two effects forming one coup-
let, must be like numbers, and of the same denomination.
Considering all the terms of the proportion as abstract
numbers, we may say that
1st Cause : 1st Effect :: 2d Caused. 2d Effect;
which will produce the same numerical result.
But as ratio is the result of comparing two numbers oi
things of the same kind (377), the first form is regarded
as the most natural and philosophical.
397. Simple causes and simple effects give Tise to simple
ratios ; compound causes and compound effects to compound
ratios.

The required term will be denoted by a ( ), and designated " blank."

Rule. I. Arrange the terms in the statement so that the
causes shall compose one couplet, and the effects the other, put-
ting ( ) in the place of the required term.
II. If the required term be an extreme, divide the product
of the means by the given extreme; if the required term be a
mean, divide the product of the extremes by the given mean.
1. If the terms of any couplet be of different denominations, theymust be reduced
to the same unit value.
2. If the odd term be a compound number, it must be reduced to its lowest unit.
3. If the divisor and dividend contain one or more factors common to both, they
should be canceled. If any of the terms of a proportion contain mixed numbers,
they should first be changed to improper fractions, or the fractional part to a decimal.
4. When the vertical line is used, the divisor and the required term are written on
the left, amd the terms of the dividend on the right.
PROPORTION.
399. We will now give another method of solving ques-
tions in simple proportion, without making the statement,
and which may be used, by those who prefer it, to the one
already given. We will term it the
Second Method.
Every question which properly belongs to simple propor-
tion must contain four numbers, at least three of which
must be given (389). Of the three given numbers, one
must always be of the same denomination as the required
number. The remaining two will be like numbers, and
bear the same relation to each other that the third does to
the required number; in other words, the ratio of the third
to the required number will be the same as the ratio of the
other two numbers.
Regarding the third or odd term as the antecedent of the
second couplet of a proportion, we find the consequent or re-
quired term by multiplying the antecedent by the ratio (379).
By comparing the two like numbers, in any given ques-
tion, with the third, we may readily determine whether the
answer, or required term, will be greater or less than the
third term; if greater, then the ratio will be greater than
1, and the two like numbers may be arranged in the form
of an improper fraction as a multiplier; if the answer, or
required term, is to be less than the third term, then the
ratio will be less than 1, and the two like numbers may be
arranged in the form of a proper fraction, as a multiplier.

operation. Analysis. It will
i£3 x 20 ... be readily seen in this
12 x *£, bitten —^ = $60. example, that 4 cords
and 20 cords are the
like terms, and that $12 is the third term, and of the same denomina-
tion as the answer or required term.
If 4 cords cost $12, will 20 cords cost more, or less, than 4 cords?
evidently more: then the answer or required term will be greater
287
than the third term, and the ratio greater than 1. The ratio of 4
cords to 20 cords is *40-, or 5; hence the ratio of £12 to the answer
must be 5, and the answer will be or 5 times $12, which is $60.
2. If 12 yards of cloth cost $48, what will 4 yards cost?
operation. Analysis. In this example we
48 x — $16, Ans. see that 12 yards and 4 yards are
the like terms and $48 the third
term, and of the same denomination as the required answer.
If 12 yards cost $48, will 4 yards cost more or less than 12 yards?
less: then the ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper
fraction. The ratio of 12 yards to 4 yards is T%; hence the ratio of $ 18
to the answer is j1*, and the answer will be T% times $48, which is $16.
Rlle. I. With the two given numbers, which are of the
same name or kind, form a ratio greater or less than 1,
according as the ansioer is to be greater or less than the
third given number.
II. Multiply the third number by this ratio, and the pro-
duct will be the required number or answer.

COMPOUND PROPORTION.
400. Compound Proportion embraces that class of
questions in which the causes, or the effects, or both, are
compound.
The required term may be a cause, or a single element of a
cause; or it may be an effect, or a single element of an effect.

this example the

as stated, will read thus: if 7
men, in 12 days, dig n ditch GO
feet long, 8 feet wide, and G
feet deep, 21 men, in 2J days,
will dig a ditch how many, or
(hlank) feet long, 3 feet wide,
and 8 feet deep?
Rule. I. Of the given terms, select those which constitute
the causes, and those which constitute the effects, and arrange
them in couplets, putting ( ) in place of the required term.
291
II. Tlien, if the blank term ( ) occur in cither of the ex-
tremes, make the product of the means a dividend, and the
product of the extremes a divisor; but if the blank term occur
in either mean, make the product of the extremes a dividend,
and the product of the means a divisor.
1. The causes must bo exactly alike in the number and kind of their terms; the
same is true of the effects.
2. The same preparation of the terms by reduction is to be observed as in simple
proportion.
401. We will now solve an example according to the
Second Method given in Simple Proportion.
1. If 18 men can build 42 rods of wall in 16 days, how
many men can build 28 rods in 8 days?
Since compound proportion is made up of two or more simple pro-
portions, if this third or odd term be multiplied by the compound ratio,
or by the simple ratio of each couplet successively, the product will
be the required term.
By comparing the terms of each couplet with the third term we may
readily determine whether the answer, or term sought, will be greater
or less than the third term; if greater, then the ratio will be greater
than 1, and the multiplier an improper fraction; if less, the ratio will
be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction.
First we will compare the terms composing the first couplet, 43
rods and 28 rods, with the third term, 18 men. If 42 rods require
18 men, how many men will 28 rods require? less men ; hence the
ratio is less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction, |f; next, if
10 days require 18 men, how many men will 8 days require? more
men; hence the ratio is greater than 1, and the multiplier an improper
fraction, Y". Regarding the third term as the antecedent of a couplet,
the consequent being the term sought, if we multiply this third term
by the simple ratios, or by their product, we shall have the required
term or answer, thus: 18 x J J x Jgt = 24, as shown in the operation.

all the terms appear in pairs or couplets,
except the 16 days, which is of the same
kind as the answer sought.
We will proceed to compare the terms
of each couplet with the 16 days. First,
if 5 compositors require 16 days, how
many days will 10 compositors require?
less days; hence the multiplier is the

Next, if 14 hours a day require 16 days,
how many days will 7 hours a day require? more days; hence the,
multiplier is the improper fraction \4, and we have 16 x Ts5 x
Next, if 20 sheets require 16 days, how many days will 40 sheets re-
quire 1 more days; hence the multiplier is the improper fraction \%,
and we have 16 x-fa x\4x f g. Pursuing tho same method with the
other couplets, we obtain the result as shown in the operation.
Rule. I. Of the terms composing each couplet form a
ratio greater or less than 1, in the same manner as if the
answer depended on those two and the third or odd term.
II. Multiply the third or odd term by these ratios succes-
sively, and the product will be the answer sought.
By the odd term is meant the one that is of the same kind as the answer.
The following examples may bo solved by either of the
given methods:

Case II.
408. To find each partner's share of the profit
or loss when their capital is employed for unequal
periods of time.
It is evident that the respective shares of profit and loss
will depend upon two conditions, viz.: the amount of capital
invested by each, and the time it is employed.
1. Two persons form a partnership; A puts in $450 for
7 months, and B $300 for 9 months; they lose $156; how
much is each man's share of the loss?
operatton. Analysis. The
$450 x 7 = $3150, A's capital for 1 mo. nse of $150 capital
$300 x 9 = $2700, B's for 7 months is the
— same as the use of

v »' as the use of 9 times
$156 x = $72, B's" $3c0j or |3700 for
1 month. The en-
tire capital for 1 month is equivalent to $3150 + $2700 = $5850. If
the loss, $156, be divided between the two partners, according to
Case I, the results will be the loss of each as shown in the operation.

Examples of this kind may also be solved by proportion as in Case I,
the causes being compounded of capital and time; thus,

Rule. Multiply each man's capital by the time it is em-
ployed in trade, and add the products. Then multiply the
entire profit or loss by the ratio of the sum of the products to
each product, and the results will be the respective shares of
profit or loss of each partner. Or,
Multiply each man's capital by the time it is employed in
trade, and regard each product as his capital, and the sum
of the products as the entire capital, and solve by proportion,
as in Case I.

ANALYSIS.
409. Analysis, in arithmetic, is the process of solving
problems independently of set rules, by tracing the relations
of the given numbers and the reasons of the separate steps
of the operation according to the special conditions of each
question.
410. In solving questions by analysis, we generally reason
from the given number to unity, or 1, and then from unity,
or 1, to the required number.
411. United States money is reckoned in dollars, dimes,
cents, and mills (180), one dollar being uniformly valued
in all the States at 100 cents.
At the time of the adoption of our decimal currency by Congress, in 1780, the
colonial currency, or bills of credit, issued by the colonies, had depreciated in value;
and this depreciation, being unequal in the different colonies, gave rise to the dif-
ferent values of the State currencies.
In many of the States it was customary to give the retail price of articles in shil-
lings and pence, and the cost of the whole in dollars and cents.

Analysis. Since 8 men require 12 days of 10 hours each to build
the wall, 1 man would require 8 times 12 days of 10 hours each, and
10 times (12 x 8) days of 1 hour each. To build a wall 1 ft. long would

to build a wall 1 ft. thick, J as much time as to build a wall 4 ft. thick.
Now, 24 men could build this wall in ^ as many days, by working
1 hour a day, as 1 man could build it, and in J as many days by work-
ing 8 hours a day, as by working 1 hour a day; but to build a wall

ALLIGATION.
413.' Alligation treats of mixing or compounding two
or more ingredients of different values. It is of two kinds—
Alligation Medial and Alligation Alternate.
414. Alligation Medial is the process of finding the
average price or quality of a compound of several simp!:
ingredients whose prices or qualities are known.
1. A miller mixes 40 bushels of rye worth 80 cents a
bushel, and 25 bushels of corn worth 70 cents a bushel, with
15 bushels of wheat worth $1.50 a bushel; what is the value
of a bushel of the mixture?
operation. Analysis. Sinco 40 bushels
80 x 40 = $32.00 of rye at 80 cents a bushel is
70 x 25 = 17 50 worth $32, and 25 bushels of corn
at 70 cents a bushel is worth
$17.50, and 15 bushels of wheat
1.50 x 15 = 22.50
80 ) 72.00 at $1.50 a bushel is worth $22.60,
$90 Ans therefore the entire mixture, con-
'sisting of 80 bushels, is worth
$72, and one bushel is worth Vu of $72, or 72 80 = $.90.
Rule. Divide the entire cost or value of the ingredients
by the sum of the simples.
Examples for Practice.
2. A wine merchant mixes 12 gallons of wine, at $1 per
gallon, with 5 gallons of brandy worth $1.50 per gallon, and
3 gallons of water of no value; what is the worth of one
gallon of the mixture? Ans. $.975.
3. An innkeeper mixed 13 gallons of water with 52 gallons
of brandy, which cost him $1.25 per gallon; what is the value
of 1 gallon of the mixture, and what his profit on the sale of
tho whole at 6\ cents per gill? Ans. $1 a gallon ; $65 profit.
4. A grocer mixed 10 pounds of sugar at 8 cts. with 12
pounds at 9 cts. and 16 pounds at 11 cts., and sold the mix-
ture at 10 cents per pound; did he gain or lose by the sale,
and how much? Ans. He gained 16 cts.
ALLIGATION ALTERNATE.
5. A grocer bought 7£ dozen of eggs at 12 cents a dozen,
8 dozen at 10£ cents a dozen, 9 dozen at 11 cents a dozen,
and 10£ dozen at 10 cents a dozen. He sells them so as to
make 50 per cent. on the cost; how much did ho receive
per dozen? Ans. 16-J cents.
6. Bought 4 cheeses, each weighing 50 pounds, at 13 cents
a pound; 10, weighing 40 pounds each, at 10 cents a pound .•
and 24, weighing 25 pounds each, at 7 cents a pound; I
sold the whole at an average price of 9£ cents a pound;
what was my whole gain? . Ans. $6.
415. Alligation Alternate is the process of finding the
proportional quantities to be taken of several ingredients,
whose prices or qualities are known, to form a mixture of a
required price or quality.
Case I
.
416. To find the proportional quantity to be used
of each ingredient, when the mean price or quality
of the mixture is given.
1. What relative quantities of timothy seed worth $2 a
bushel, and clover seed worth $7 a bushel, must bo used to
form a mixture worth $5 a bushel?
operation. Analysis. Since on every ingre-
l 2 | \ 2 ) dient used whose price or quality
5 I ij/ j ^ g j Ans. is less than the mean rate there will
be a gain, and on every ingredient
whose price or quality is greater than the mean rate there will be a
loss, and since the gains and losses must be exactly equal, the relative
quantities used of each should be such as represent the unit of value.
By selling one bushel of timothy seed worth $2, for $5, there is a gain
of $3; and to gain $1 would require J of a bushel, which we place
opposite the 2. By selling one busbel of clover seed worth $7, for $5,
there is a loss of $2; and to lose $1 would require J of a bushel, which
we place opposite the 7.
In every case, to find the unit of value we must divide $1 by tho
gain or loss per bushel or pound, etc. Hence, if, every time we take
$ of a bushel of timothy seed, we take J of a bushel of clover seed,
the gain and loss will bs exactly equal, and wo shall havo J and £ for
the proportional quantities.

If we wish to express the proportional numbers in integers, wo
may reduce these fractions to a common denominator, and use their
numerators, eince fractions having a common denominator are to each
other as their numerators. (378) thus, J and ^ are equal to § and f,
and the proportional quantities are 2 bushels of timothy seed to 3
bushels of clover seed.
2. What proportions of teas worth respectively 3, 4, 7 and
10 shillings a pound, must be taken to form a mixture worth
6 shillings a pound?
operation. Analysis. To preserve the
equality of gains and losses, wo
must always compare two prices
or simples, one greater and one
less than the mean rate, and
treat each pair or couplet as a
separate example. In the given
example we form two couplets,
and may compare either 3 and 10, 4 and 7, or 3 and 7, 4 and 10.
Wo find that J of a lb. at 3s. must be taken to gain 1 shilling, and
J of a lb. at 10s. to lose 1 shilling; also, { of a lb. at 4s. to gain 1 shil-
ling, and 1 lb. at 7s. to lose 1 shilling. These proportional numbers,
obtained by comparing the two couplets, are placed in columns 1 and 2.
If, now, we reduce the numbers in columns 1 and 2 to a common de-
nominator, and use their numerators, we obtain the integral numbers
in columns 3 and 4, which being arranged in column 5, give the pro-
portional quantities to be taken of each.*
It will be seen that in comparing the simples of any couplet, one of
which is greater, and the other less than the mean rate, the propor-
tional number finally obtained for either term is the difference between
the mean rate and the other term. Thus, in comparing 3 and 10, the
proportional number of the former is 4, which is the difference between
10 and the mean rate 0; and the proportional number of the latter is 3,
which is the difference between 3 and the mean rate. The same is
true of every other couplet. Hence, when the simples and the mean
rate are integers, the intermediate steps taken to obtain the final pro-
portional numbers as in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4, may be omitted, and
the same results readily found by taking the difference between each
simple and the mean rate, and placing it opposite the one with which
it is compared.
* Prof. A. B. Canfleld, of Oneida Conference Seminary, N. Y., used this method of
Alligation, essentially, in the instruction cf his classes as early as 1846, and he was
doubtless the author cf it.
ALLIGATION ALTERNATE.
Rule. I. Write the several prices or qualities in a column,
and the mean price or quality of the mixture at the left.
II. Form couplets by comparing any price or quality less,
with one that is greater than the mean rate, placing the part
which must be used to gain 1 of the mean rate opposite the less
simple, and the part that must be used to lose 1 opposite the
greater simple, and do the same for each simple in every
couplet.
III. If the proportional numbers are fractional, they may
be reduced to integers, and if two or more stand in the same
horizontal line, they must be added j the final results will be
the proportional quantities required.
1. If the numbers in any couplet or column have a comtDDn factor; it may be
rejected.
2. We may also multiply the numbers in any couplet or column by any multiplici
we choose, without affecting the equality of the gains and losses, and thus obtain
an indefinite number of lesults, any cnc of which being taken w.!l give a correct
final result.

1. A grocer has sugars worth 6 cents, 7 cents, 12 cents,
and 13 cents per pound. He wishes to make a mixture of
120 pounds worth 10 cents/a pound; how many pounds of
each kind must he use?
opekation. Analysis. By Case I
we find the proportional
quantities of each to be
S lbs. at 6 cts., 2 lbs. at
7 cts., 3 lbs. at 12 cts.,
and 4 lbs. at 13 cts. By
adding the proportional
quantities, we find that
the mixture would be but 12 lbs. while the required mixture is 120, or
10 times 12. If the whole mixture is to be 10 times as much as the
Bum of the proportional quantities, then the quantity of each simple
used must be 10 times as much as its respective proportional, which
would require 30 lbs. at 6 cts., 20 lbs. at 7 cts., 30 lbs. at 12 cts., and
40 lbs. at 13 cts.
Rule. Find the proportional numbers as in Case I. Di-
vide the given quantity by the sum of the proportional quan-
tities, and multiply each of the proportional quantities by the
quotient thus obtained.

419. A Power is the product arising from multiplying
a number by itself, or repeating it several times as a factor;
thus, in 2 x 2 x 2 = 8, the product, 8, is a power of 2.
420. The Exponent of a power is the number denoting
how many times the factor is repeated to produce the power,
and is written above and a little to the right of the factor;
thus, 2 x 2 x 2 is written 23, in which 3 is the exponent.
Exponents likewise give names to the powers, as will b<
socn in the following illustrations:
3 = 31 = 3, the first power of 3;
3x3 = 32 = 9, the second power of 3;
3 x 3 x 3 = 33 = 27, the third power of 3.

thus, in the expression 5x5x5 = 125, 5 is the root from

SQUARE ROOT.

426. Evolution is the process of extracting the root
of a number considered as a power, and is the reverse of
Involution.
427. The Radical Sign is the character, y', which,
placed before a number, denotes that its root is to be extracted.
428. The Index of the root is the figure placed above
the radical sign, to denote what root is to be taken. When
no index is written, the index 2 is always understood.
429. A Surd is the indicated root of an imperfect power.
430. Roots are named from the corresponding powers,
as will be seen in the following illustrations:
The square root of 9 is 3, written V9 = 3.
The cube root of 27 is 3, written \/W— 3.
The fourth root of 81 is 3, written #81 = 3.
431. Any number whatever may be considered a power
whose root is to be extracted j but only the perfect powers
can have exact roots.
SQUARE ROOT.
432. The Square Root of a number is one of the two
equal factors that produce the number; thus the square
root of 49 is 7, for 7 x 7 = 49.
433. In extracting the square root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a given num-
ber and its square root. The law governing this relation is
exhibited in the following examples:

If we point off a number into two-figure periods, commen-
cing at the right hand, the number of full periods and the
left hand full or partial period will indicate the number of
places in the square root; the highest period answering to
the highest figure of the root.
4,34. 1. What is the length of one side of a square plat
containing an area of 5417 sq. ft.
operation. Analysis. Since the given figure is
54,17 | 73.6 a square, its side will be the square root
of its area, which we will proceed to com-
pute. Pointing off the given number, the
2 periods show that there will be two in-
tegral figures, tens and' units, in the root.
The tens of the root must be extracted
from the first or left hand period, 54 hun-
dreds. The greatest square in 54 hun-
dreds is 49 hundreds, the square of 7 tens;
we therefore write 7 tens in the root, at
the right of the given number.
Since the entire root is to be the side of a square, let us form a
square (Fig. I), the side of which is 70 feet long.
The area of this square is 70 x 70 = 4900 sq. ft,
which we subtract from the given number. This
is done in the operation by subtracting the
square number, 49, from the first period, 54,
and to the remainder bringing down the second
period, making the entire remainder 517.
If we now enlarge our square (Pig. I) by the addition of 517 square
feet, in such a manner as to preserve the square form, its size will be
that of the required square. To preserve the square form, the addition
must be so made as to extend the square equally in two directions;
it will therefore be composed of 2 oblong figures at the sides, and a
little square at the corner (Fig. II). Now, the width of this addition
will be the additional length to the side of the square, and conse-
quently the next figure in the rout. To find icidth we divide square
contents, or area, by length. But the length of one side of the little
square cannot be found till the width of the addition be determined,
because it is equal to this width. We will therefore add the lengths
of the 2 oblong figures, and the sum will be sufficiently near the
whole length to be used as a trial divisor.

Trial Divisor = 140.
: Complete Divisor = 143.
Each of the oblong figures is equal in length to the side of the
square first formed; and their united length
is 70 + 70 = 140 ft. (Fig. III). This num-
ber is obtained in the operation by doubling
the 7 and annexing 1 cipher, the result being
written at the left of the dividend. Dividing
517, the area, by 140, the approximate length,
we obtain 3, the probable width of the addi-
tion, and second figure of the root. Since 3 is
also the side of the little square, we can now
find the entire length of the addition, or the complete divisor, which
is 70 + 70 + 3 = 143 (Fig. III).
1 his number is found in the oper-
ation by adding 3 to the trial
divisor, and writing the result un-
derneath. Multiplying the com-
plete divisor, 143. by the trial
quotient figure, 3, and subtracting
the product from the dividend, we
obtain another remainder of 88 square feet. With this remainder,
for the same reason as before, we must proceed to make a new
enlargement; and we bring down two decimal ciphers, because the
next figure of the root, being tenths, its square will be hundredths.
The trial divisor to obtain the width of this new enlargement, or the
next figure in the root, will be, for the same reason as before, twico
73, the root already found, with one cipher annexed. But since the
7 has already been doubled in the operation, we have only to double
the last figure of the complete divisor, 143, and annex a cipher, to
obtain the new trial divisor, 146.0. Dividing, we obtain .6 for the
trial figure of the root; then proceeding as before, we obtain 146.6
for a complete divisor, 87.96 for a product; and there is still a re-
mainder of .04. Hence, the side of the given square plat is 73.6 feet,
nearly. From this example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Point off the given number into periods of two
figures each, counting from unit's place toward the left and
right.
II. Find the greatest square number in the left hand period,
and write its root for the first figure in the root; subtract the
square number from the left hand period, and to the remain-

III. At the left of the dividend write twice the first figure
of the root, and annex one cipher, for a trial divisor; divide
the dividend by the trial divisor, and write the quotient for a
trial figure in the root.
IV. Add the trial figure of the root to the trial divisor for
a complete divisor; multiply the complete divisor by the trial
figure in the root, and subtract the product from the divi-
dend, and to the remainder bring down the next period for a
new dividend.
V. To the last complete divisor add the last figure of the
root, and to the sum annex one cipher, for a new trial divisor,
with which proceed as before.
1. If at anytime the product be greater than the dividend, diminish the trial figure
of the root, and correct the erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex another cipher to the trial divisor, and
another period to the dividend, and proceed as before.

CUBE ROOT.
442. The Cube Root of a number is one of the three
equal factors that produce the number. Thus, the cube
root of 27 is 3, since 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.
443. In extracting the cube root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a cube and
its root. The law governing this relation is exhibited u
the following examples:
Hoots. Cubes. Roots. Cubes.
Ill 1
9 729 10 1,000
99 . 907,299 100 1,000,000
999 997,002,999 1000 1,000,000,000
From these examples, wo perceive,
1st. That a root consisting of 1 place may have from 1 to
3 places in the cube.
2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root
adds three places to the cube.
If we point off a number into three-figure periods, com-
mencing at the right hand, the number of full periods and
the left hand full or partial period will indicate the number
of places in the cube root, the highest period answering to the
highest figure of the root.

Hock containing 413494 solid inches?
operation—commenced. Analtsis. Since the block is a
413494 | 74 cube, its side will be the cube root
of its solid contents, which we will
proceed to compute. Pointing off
14700 70494 tke gjven number, the two periods
show that there will be two figures,
tens and units, in the root. The tens of the root must be extracted
from the first period, 413 thousands. The greatest cube in 413 thou-
sands is 343 thousands, the cube of 7 tens; we therefore write 7 tens
in the root at the right of the given number.
333
Since the entire root is to be the side of a cube, let us form a
cubical block (Fig. I), the side
of which is 70 inches in length.
The contents of this cube are
70 x 70 x 70 = 343,000 solid
inches, which we subtract from
the given number. This is done
in the operation by subtracting
the cube number, 343, from the
first period, 413, and to the re-
mainder bringing down the sec-
ond period, making the entire
remainder 70494.
If we now enlarge our cubical
block, (Fig. I), by the addition of 70494 solid inches, in such a man-
ner as to preserve the cubical form, its size will be that of the required
block. To preserve the cubical form, the addition must be made upon
three adjacent sides or faces. The addition will therefore be com-
posed of 3 flat blocks to cover the 3 faces, (Fig. II,; 3 oblong blocks
to fill the vacancies at the edges, (Fig. Ill); and 1 small cubical block
to fill the vacancy at the corner, (Fig. IV.) Now, the thickness of this
enlargement will be the addititmal length of the side of the cube,
and, consequently, the second figure in the root. To find thickness,
we may divide solid contents by surface, or area. But the area of
the 3 oblong blocks and lit-
tle cube cannot be found
till the thickness of the ad-
dition be determined, be-
cause their common breadth
is equal to this thickness.
We will therefore find the
area of the three fiat blocks,
which is sufficiently near
the whole area to be used
as a trial divisor. As these
are each equal in length and
breadth to the side of tho
cube whose faces they cover,
the whole area of the three
is 70 x 70 x 3 = 14700 square inches. This number is obtained in the
operation by annexing 2 ciphers to three times the square of 7; the re-
sult being written at the left hand of the dividend. Dividing, we obtain

ment, or the next figure of the root,
blocks to cover the three sides of tl
ldition, and second figure of the
root. \Y ith this assumed figure,
we will complete our divisor by
adding the area of the 4 blocks,
before undetermined. The 3 ob-
long blocks are each 70 inches
long; and the little cube, being
equal in each of its dimensions
io the thickness of the addition
must be 4 inches long. Her.^e,
their united length is 7C- + 70
+ 70 + 4 = 214. This number -
is obtained in the operation by
multiplying the 7 by 3, and an-
nexing the 4 to the product, the
result being written in column
I, on the next line below the
trial divisor. Multiplying 214,
the length, by 4, the common
width, we obtain 836, the area of
the four blocks, which added to
14700, the trial divisor, makes
15556, the complete divisor; and
multiplying this by 4, the second
figure in the root, and subtract-
ing the product from the divi-
dend, we obtain a remainder of
8270 solid inches. With this re-
mainder, for the same reason as
before, we must proceed to make
a new enlargement. But since
we have already two figures in
the root, answering to the two
periods of the given number,
the next figure of the root must
be a decimal; and we therefore
annex to the remainder a period
of three decimal ciphers, mpk-
ing 8270.000 for a new dividend.
The trial divisor to obtain the
thickness of this second enlarge-
will be the area of three new flat
e cube already formed; and this

surface, (Fig. IV,) ia composed of 1 face of each of the flat Mocks
already used, 2 faces of each of the oblong blocks, and 3 faces of
the little cube. But we have in the complete divisor, 15556, 1 face
of each of the flat blocks, oblong blocks, and little cube; and in the
correction of the trial divisor, 85G, 1 face of each of the oblong blocks
and of the little cube; and in the square of the last root figure, 16, a
third face of the little cube. Hence, 16 + 856 + 15556 = 16428, the
significant figures of the new trial divisor. This number is obtained
in the opera
tion by adding
the square of
the last root
figure mental-
ly, and com-
bining units
of like order,
thus: 16, 6,
and 6 are 28,
and we write
the unit figure in the new trial divisor; then 2 to carry, and 5 and 5
are 12, etc. We annex 2 ciphers to this trial divisor, as to the former,
and dividing, obtain 5, the third figure in the root. To complete tho
second trial divisor, after the manner of the first, the correction may
be found by annexing .5 to 3 times the former figures, 74, and multi-
plying this number by .5. But as we have, in column I, 3 times 7,
with 4 annexed, or 214, we need only multiply tho last figure, 4, by 3, and
annex .5, making 222.5, which multiplied by .5 gives 111 25, the correc-
tion required. Then we obtain the complete divisor, 16539.25, the pro-
duct, 8269.625, and the remainder, .375, in the manner shown by the for-
mer steps. From this example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Point off the given number into periods of throe
figures each, counting from units' place toward the left and
right.
II. Find the greatest cube that does not exceed the left hand
period, and write its root for the first figure in the required
root; subtract the cube from the left hand period, and to the
remainder bring down the next period for a dividend.
III. At the left of the dividend write three times the square
of the first figure of the root, and annex two ciphers, for a trial
divisor; divide the dividend by the trial divisor, and write
the quotient for a trial figure in the root.
EVOLUTION.
IV. Annex the trial figure to three times the former figure,
and write the result in a column marked I, one line below the
trial divisor; multiply this term by the trial figure, and write
the product on the same line in a column marked II; add
this term as a correction to the trial divisor, and the result
will be the complete divisor.
V. Multiply the complete divisor by the trial figure, and
subtract the product from the dividend, and to the remainder
bring down the next period for a new dividend.
VI. Add the square of the last figure of the root, the last
term in column II, and the complete divisor together, and an-
nex two ciphers, for a new trial divisor; with which obtain
another trial figure in the root.
VII. Multiply the unit figure of the last term in column I
by o, and annex the trial figure of the root for the next term
of column I; multiply this result by the trial figure of the root
for the next term of column II; add this term to the trial
divisor for a complete divisor, with which proceed as before.
1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend, diminish the trial
figure of the root, and correct thu erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex two more ciphers to the trial divisor, and
another period to the dividend; then proceed as before with column I, annexing
both cipher and trial figure.

ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION,
445. An Arithmetical Progression, or Series, is a
series of numbers increasing or'decreasing by a common dif-
ference. Thus, 3, 5, 7, 9,11, etc., is an arithmetical pro-
gression with an ascending series, and 13,10, 7, 4, etc., is an
arithmetical progression with a descending series.
446. The Terms of a series are the numbers of which
it is composed.
447. The Extremes are the first and last terms.
448. The Means are the intermediate terms.
449. The Common Difference is the difference between
any two adjacent terms.
450. There are five parts in an arithmetical series, any
three of which being given, the other tioo may be found.
They are as follows: the first term, last term, common dif-
ference, number of terms, and sum of all the terms.
Case L
451. To find the last term when the first term,
common difference, and number of terms are given
Let 2 be the first term of an ascending series, and 3 the
common difference; then the series will be written, 2, 5, 8,
11,14, or analyzed thus: 2, 2 + 3,2 + 3+3, 2 + 3+ 3 +
3, 2 + 3 + 3+ 3 + 3.
Here we see that, in an ascending series, we obtain the
second term by adding the common difference once to the first
term; the third term, by adding the common difference
twice to the first term; and, in general, we obtain any term
329
by adding the common difference as many times to the first
term as there are terms less one.
The analysis for a descending series would be similar.
Rule. Multiply the common difference by the number of
terms less one, and add the product to the first term, if the
series be ascending, and subtract it if the series be descending.
Examples for Practice.

difference 3, and the number of terms 19; what is the last
term? Ans. 58.

Case II.
452. To find the common difference when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
Referring to the series, 2, 5, 8, 11,14, analyzed in 451,
we readily see that, by subtracting the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many
times as there are terms less one; thus, by taking away 2 in
the fifth term, 2 + 3-1-3 + 3 + 3, we have 3 taken 4 times.
Rcle. Divide the difference of the extremes by the number
of terms less one.

the first term, and we have the series, and consequently the means.
Ans. 3, 3£, 4, 4£, 5, 5£, etc.
Case III.
453. To find the number of terms when the ex-
tremes and common difference are given.
Examining the series, 2, 5, 8, 11,14, analyzed in 451,
we also see that after taking away the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many
times ti the number of terms, less 1.
Rule. Divide the difference of the extremes by the common
difference, and add 1 to the quotient.

Case IV.
454. To find the sum of all the terms when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
To deduce a rule lor finding the sum of all the terms, we
will take the series 2, 5, 8, 11,14, writing it under itself in
an inverse order, and add each term; thus,
2 + 5 + 8 + 11 +14 = 40, once the sum.
14 f 11 + 8 + 5 + 2 = 40, " ""
16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 80, twice the sum.
Here we perceive that 16, the sum of the extremes, mul-
tiplied by 5, the number of terms, equals 80, which is twice
the sum of the series. Dividing 80 by 2 gives 40, which is
the sum required.
Rule. Multiply the sum of the extremes by the number of
terms, and divide the product by 2.

12 ; what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 222.

GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION.
4:55. A Geometrical Progression is a series of num-
bers increasing or decreasing by a constant multiplier.
When the multiplier ij greater than a unit, the series is
ascending; thus, 2, G, 18, 54, 162, is an ascending series,
in which 3 is the multiplier.
When the multiplier is less than a unit, the series is de-
scending j thus, 162, 54, 18, 6, 2, is a descending series, in
which ^ is the multiplier.
45G. The Ratio is the constant multiplier.
4:51. In every geometrical progression there are five
parts to be considered, any three of which being given, the
other two may be determined. They are as follows: The
first term, last term, ratio, number of terms, and the sum of
all the terms.
The first and last terms are the extremes, and the inter-
mediate terms are the means.
Case I.
458. To find any term, tho first term, the ratio,
and number of terms being given.
The first term is supposed to exist independently of the
ratio. Using the ratio once as a factor, we have the second
term; using it twice, or its second power, we have the third
term; using it three times, or its third power, we have the
fourth term; and, in general, the power of the ratio in any
term is one less than the number of the term. The ascend-
ing series, 2, 6, 18, 54, may be analyzed thus: 2, 2 x 3, 2
x3x 3, 2x3x3x3.
In this illustration we see that
1st term, 2, is independent of the ratio.
2d term, 6 = 2x3 = the first term into the 1st power of
the ratio.
3d term, 18 = 2 x38 = the first term into the 2d power
of the ratio.
4th term, 54 = 2 x 33 = the first term into the 3d power
of the ratio.
Rule. Multiply the first term by that power of the ratio
denoted by the number of terms less 1.

Case II.
459. To find the sum of all the terms, the ex-
tremes and ratio being given.
If we take the series 2, 8, 32, 128, 512, in which the ratio
is 4, multiply each term by the ratio, and add the terms
thus multiplied, we shall have
8 + 32 + 128 + 512 + 2048 = 2728 = | ^Xhe"t?rms? sDm °'
But 2 + 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 = 682=
Hence, by subtracting, we get 2048- 2 = 2040 =
Dividing by 3, the ratio less one, 2046 -s-3 = 082 =
Once the sum of all tho
terms.
Three times the sum ol
all the terms.
Once the sum of all tho
terms.
The subtraction is performed by taking the lower line or
series from the tipper. All the terms cancel except 2048
and 2. Taking their difference, which is 3 times the sum,
and dividing by 3, the ratio less one, we must have the
sum of all the terms.
PEOMISUUOUS EXAMPLES.
Rule. Multiply the greater extreme by the ratio, subtract
•the less extreme from the product, and divide the remainder
by the ratio less 1.
* Let every decreasing aeries be inverted, and the first term called the last; then the
ratio will be greater than a unit. If the series be infinite, the first term is a cipher.

MENSURATION.
MENSURATION OF LINES AND SUPERFICIES.
4GO. In taking the measure of any line, surface, or solid, we are
always governed by some denomination, a unit of which is called the
Unit of Measure. Thus, if any lineal measure be estimated in feet,
the unit of measure is 1 foot; if in inches, the unit is 1 inch. If any
superficial measure be estimated in feet, the unit of measure is 1
square foot; if in yards, the unit is 1 square yard.
461. If any solid or cubic measure be estimated in feet, the unit of
measure is 1 cubic foot; if in yards, the unit is 1 cubic yard.
462. The area of a figure is its superficial contents, or the
surface included within any given lines,
without regard to thickness.
463. An Oblique Angle is an
angle greater or less than a right angle;
thus, ABC and C B D are oblique angle3.

MEIKIC SYSTEM. 345
THE METRIC SYSTEM.*

10 Decimeters, or 100 Centimeters, in length. 1 Cu. Centimeter.
Scale ,'a of the Mxact Sine. Exact Size.
481. The Metric System of Weights and Measures
has now received the sanction of law among more than half
the inhabitants of the civilized world. Up to this date it
has been adopted in France, Germany, Austria, the Nether-
lands, Southern Europe, and South America, and has been
bgalized in Great Britain, Germany, and the United
States.
* The Metric System, as it was presented in all the editions of this
book, printed previous to 1877, was useless, because the symbols and
applications did not correspond with present usage.
This will be a sufficient reason for substituting in place of the
former matter, a condensed and practical treatise of the system,
together with some useful miscellaneous tables.
METRIC SYSTEM.
482. The Metric System of weights and measures is based
upon the decimal scale.
483. The Meter is the base of the system, and is the one ten
millionth part of the distance on the earth's surface from the equator
to either pole, or 39.37079 inches.
From the Meter are made the Ar (are), the Liter (leeter), and the
Oram; these constitute the primary or principal units of the system,
from which all the others are derived.
484. The Multiple Units, or higher denominations, are
named by prefixing to the name of the primary units the Greek
numerals, Deka (10), Hecto (100), KUo (1000), and Myra (10000).
485. The Sllb-Mllltiple Units, or lower denominations, are
named by prefixing to the names of the primary units the Latin
numerals, Deci (-fa), Centi (jjj), Mttli (nfcj)-
Hence, it is apparent from the name of a unit whether it is greater
or less than the standard unit, and also how many times.
Meter means measure; and the three principal units are length,
capacity or volume, and weight.

is about | of a common mile.
347
The Centimeter and Millimeter are used by mechanics and others
for minute lengths. The Dekameler, Hektometer, and Myriameter are
seldom used.
The Square and Cubic Measures are only the squares and cubes of
the measures of length, as shown in the following tables.

The Cubic Meter is the unit for measuring ordinary solids.
The Ster is the unit of wood measure, and is equal to a cubic
meter, or .2759 cord.
A Cubic Meter of water weighs 1000 kilos, or a metric ton.
The scale for the meter, liter and gram is uniformly 10; but in the
Bcale for the square meter, 100 units of any order make one unit of
the next higher; and in the scale for the cubic meter, 1000 units of
any order make one of the next higher.

METRIC SYSTEM.
491. METRIC NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
The Metric System is based upon the Arabic Notation,
the denominations corresponding with the orders of the
Arabic notation; and hence is written like United States
Money, the lowest denomination at the right, as illustrated
in the following
The number is read 67015.638 meters; or if expressed iD
centimeters it is read 6701563.8 centimeters; if in kilometers^
it is read 67.015638 kilometers; or, it may be read 6 myria*
meters, 7 kilometers, 0 hektometers, 1 dekameter, 5 meters,
6 decimeters, 3 centimeters, 8 millimeters.
The names mill, cent, dime, used in United States Money, corres-
pond to milli, centi, deci, in the Metric System. Hence the eagU
might be called the deka-dollar, since it is 10 dollars ; the dime, a deci
dollar, since it is fa of a dollar, etc.
Write 3672.045 grams, and read it in the several orders;
read it in hektograms; in kilograms; in decigrams; hf.
centigrams.
Rule.— Write in their consecutive order the several denom-
inations, and place a decimal point between the given denom-
ination and those of lower denominations.
1. Read 1456.34 liters, in metric units; read it in centi-
liters; in dekaliters; in hektoliters.

to grains. 15.432 grains make one gram; hence there are as many
grams in 71750 grains as 15.432 grains is contained times in 71750
grains. And since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, dividing
4649.43 G. by 1000 will give the kilograms in 10 lb. 4 oz. Therefore,
10 lb. 4 oz. is equal to 4.61943 Kg.

DANIEL W. PISH, A.M.,
In the Clerk's Office of the District Conrt of the United States, for the Navtf el a
District of New York.
Copyright, 1877, by Daniel W. Fuh,
PROGRESS and improvement characterize almost every art and
science; and within the last few years the science of Arithmetic
has received many important additions and improvements, which
have appeared from time to time successively in the different treatises
published upon this subject.
In the preparation of this work it has been the author's aim to
combine, and to present in one harmonious whole, all these modern
improvements, as well as to introduce some new methods and prac-
tical operations not found in other works of the same grade; in short,
to present the subject of Arithmetic to the pupil more as a science
than an art; to teach him methods of thought, and how to reason,
rather than what to do; to give unity, system, and practical utility to
the science and art of computation.
The author believes that both teacher and pupil should have the
privilege, as well as the benefit, of performing at least a part of the
thinking and the labor necessary to the study of Arithmetic ; hence
the present work has not been encumbered with the multiplicity of
"notes," "suggestions," and superfluous operations so common'to
most Practical Arithmetics of the present day, and which prevent the
cultivation of that self-reliance, that clearness of thought, and that
vigor of intellect, which always characterize the truly educated mind.
The author claims for this treatise improvement upon, if not supe-
riority over, others of the kind in the following particulars, viz.: In
the mechanical and typographical style of the work; the open and
attractive page; the progressive and scientific arrangement of the
subjects; clearness and conciseness of definitions; fullness and accu-
racy in the new and improved methods of operations and analyses;
brevity and perspicuity of rules; and in the very large number of
examples prepared and arranged with special reference to their prac-
tical utility, and their adaptation to the real business of active life. The
PBEFACE
answers to a part of the examples have been omitted, that the learner
may acquire the discipline resulting- from verifying the operations.
Particular attention is invited to improvements in the subjects of
Common Divisors, Multiples, Fractions, Percentage, Interest, Pro-
portion, Analysis, Alligation, and the Roots, as it is believed these
articles contain some practical features not common to other authors
upon these subjects.
The improvements in Percentage made necessary by the financial
changes of the last few years are especially noticeable. The different
kinds of United States Securities, Bonds, and Treasury Notes are
described, and their comparative value in commercial transactions
illustrated by practical examples. The difference between Gold and
Currency, and the corresponding difference in prices, exhibited in
trade, are taught and illustrated, and many other things that every
commercial student and business man ought to know and understand.
It is not claimed that this is a perfect work, for perfection is im-
possible; but no effort has been spared to present a clear, scientific,
comprehensive, and complete system, sufficiently full for the busi-
ness man and the scholar; not encumbered with unnecessary theories,
end yet combining and systematizing real improvements of a practical
and useful nature. How nearly this end has been attained the intel-
ligent and experienced teacher and educator must determine.

NOTICE.
This book has been newly electrotyped in the latest and best style
of typography. No change has been made in the text, except to cor-
rect positive errors, and drop a few obsolete terms from the tables.
These improvements are designed to give new life to a book that
has proved its real merits by the very large circulation it has obtained

DEFINITIONS.
1. Quantity is any thing that can be increased, dimin
ished, or measured.
2. Mathematics is the science of quantity.
3. A Unit is one, or a single thing.
4. A Number is a unit, or a collection of units.
5. An Integer is a whole number.
6. The Unit "of a Number is one of the collection of
units forming the number. Thus, the unit of 23 is 1; of
23 dollars, 1 dollar; of 23 feet, 1 foot.
7. Like Numbers are numbers that have the same kind
of unit. Thus, 74,16, and 250; 7 dollars and 62 dollars;
4 feet 6 inches, and 17 feet 9 inches.
8. An Abstract Number is a number used without
reference to any particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17;
365; 8540.
9. A Concrete Number is a number used with refer-
ence to some particular thing or quantity. Thus, 17 dollars;
365 days; 8540 men.
1. The unit of an abstract number is 1, and Is called Unity.
2. Concrete numbers are, by some, called Denominate Numbers. Denomination
means the name of the unit of a concrete number.
10. Arithmetic is the Science of numbers, and the Art
of computation.
11. A Sign is a character used to indicate an operation,
or for abbreviating an expression.
12. A Rule is a prescribed method for performing an
operation.

NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
13. Notation is a method of writing or expressing num-
bers by characters.
14. Numeration is a method of reading numbers ex
pressed by characters.
15. Two systems of notation are in general use—tht,
Roman and the Arabic.
The Roman Notation ts supposed to hare been first need by the Romans; hence
its name. The Arabic Notation was introduced into Europe by the Arabs, by wh«n
it was supposed to have been invented. But investigations have shown that it was
adopted by them about COO years ago, and that it has been in use among the Hin-
doos more than 3000 years. From this latter fact it is sometimes called the Indian
Notation.
The Roman Notation.
16. Employs seven capital letters to express numbers.
Thus,
Letters. I V X L C D M
Values. One. Five. Ten. Fifty. fcSed. tho^Bd.
17. The Roman Notation is founded upon five principles,
as follows:
1st. Repeating a letter repeats its value. Thus, II repre-
sents two, XX twenty, CCC three hundred.
2d. If a letter of any value is placed after one of greater
value, its value is to be added to that of the greater. Thus,
XI represents eleven, LX sixty, DC six hundred.
3d. If a letter of any value be placed before one of greater
value, its value is to be taken from that of the greater.
Thus, IX represents nine, XL forty, CD four hundred.
Define notation. Numeration. What systems of notation are now
in general use? From what are their names derived? What are used
to express numbers in the Roman notation? What is the value of
each? What is the first principle of combination? Second? Tnird?
3
4th. If a letter of any value be placed between two letters,
cacli of greater value, its value is to be taken from the sum
of the other two. Thus, XIV represents fourteen, XXIX
twenty-nine, XCIV ninety-four.
5th. A bar or dash placed over a letter increases its value
one thousand times. Thus, V signifies five, and V five thou-
sand; L fifty, and L fifty thousand.

The Arabic Notation.
18. Employs ten characters or figures to express num-
bers. Thus,
Figures. 0123 456789
Names, Cipher. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.
19. The first character, or cipher, is called naught, be-
cause it has no value of its own. The other nine charaoters
are called significant figures, because each has a value of its
own.
20. The significant figures are also called Digits, a word
derived from the Latin term digitus, which signifies finger.
21. The naught or cipher is also called nothing, and zero.
The ten Arabic characters are the Alphabet of Arithmetic,
and by combining them according to certain principles, all
numbers can be expressed. We will now examine the most
important of these principles.*
22. Each of the nine digits has a value of its own.
hence any number not greater than 9 can be expressed by
one figure.
* Fractional and decimal notation, and the notation of componnd numbers, will
be discussed in their appropriate places.
What are used to express numbers in the Arabic notation? What
is the value of each? What general name is given to the significant
figures? Why? Numbers less than ten, how expressed?
11
23. As there is no single character to represent ten, we
express it by writing the unit, 1, at the left of the cipher, 0,
thus, 10. In the same manner we represent
2 tens, 3 tens, i tens, 5 tens, 6 tens, 7 tens, 8 tens, 9 tens,
or or or or or or or or
Twenty, Thirty, Forty, Fifty, Sixty, Seventy, Eighty, Ninety,
20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80; 90.
24. When a number is expressed by two figures, the right
hand figure is called units, and the left hand figure tens.
We express the numbers between 10 and 20 by writing
the 1 in the place of tens, with each of the digits respec-
tively in the place of units. Thus,
Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fonrteen, Fifteen, Sixteen, Seventeen, Eighteen, Nineteen,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
In like manner we express the numbers between 20 and
30, between 30 and 40, and between any two successive tens.
Thus, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 47, 56, 72, 93.
The greatest number that can be expressed by two figures
is 99.
25. We express one hundred by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of two ciphers, or the number 10 at the left
hand of one cipher; thus, 100. In like manner we write
two hundred, three hundred, etc., to nine hundred. Thus,
One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine
hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred, hundred,
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 80Q, 900.
26. When a number is expressed by three figures, the
right hand figure is called units, the second figure, tens, and
the left hand figure, hundreds.
As the ciphers have, of themselves, no value, but are
always used to denote the absence of value in the places they

occupy, -we express tens and units with hundreds, by writ-
ing, in place of the ciphers, the numbers representing the
tens and units. To express one hundred fifty we write 1
hundred, 5 tens, and 0 units; thus, 150. To express seven
hundred ninety-two, we write 7 hundreds, 9 tens, and 2
units; thus,

4. Express by figures nine hundred.
5. Express by figures two hundred ninety.
6. Write eight hundred nine.
7. Write five hundred five.
8. Write five hundred fifty-seven.
27. We express one thousand by writing the unit, 1, at
the left hand of three ciphers, the number 10 at the left
hand of two ciphers, or the number 100 at the left hand of
one cipher; thus, 1000. In the same manner we write two
thousand, three thousand, etc., to nine thousand; thus,

28. When a number is expressed by four figures, the
places, commencing at the right hand, are units, tens, hun-
dreds, thousands.

To express hundreds, tens, and units with thousands, we
write in each place the figure indicating the number we wish
to express in that place. To write four thousand two hun-
dred sixty-nine, we write 4 in the place of thousands, 2 in
the place of hundreds, 6 in the place of tens, and 9 in the
place of units; thus,

29. Next to thousands come tens of thousands, and next
to these come hundreds of thousands, as tens and hundreds
come in their order after units. Ten thousand is expressed
by removing the unit, 1, one place to the left of the place

ciphers; thus, 10000; and one hundred thousand is ex-
pressed by removing the unit, 1, still one place further to
the left, or by writing it at the left hand of five ciphers;
thus, 100000. We can express thousands, tens of thou-
sands, and hundreds of thousands in one number, in the
same manner as we express units, tens, and hundreds in one
number To express five hundred twenty-one thousand
eight hundred three, we write 5 in the sixth place, counting
from units, 2 in the fifth place, 1 in the fourth place, 8 in
the third place, 0 in the second place (because there are no
tens), and 3 in the place of units; thus,

For convenience in reading large numbers, point them off,
by commas, into periods of three figures each, counting from
the right hand or unit figure. This pointing enables us to
read the hundreds, tens, and units in each period with
facility.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
This is called the French method of pointing off the periods, and is the one in
general use in this country.
31. Figures occupying different places in a number, as
units, tens, hundreds, etc., are said to express different
orders of units.
Simple units are called units of the first order.
Tens "" " "" second"
Hundreds "" " "" third"
Thousands "" " ""fourth «
Tens of thousands" " " ""fifth"
and so on. Thus, 452 contains 4 units of the third order,
5 units of the second order, and 2 units of the first order.
1,030,600 contains 1 unit of the seventh order (millions), 3
units of the fifth order (tens of thousands), and G units of
the third order (hundreds).
Examples for Practice.
Write in figures, and read the following numbers 5
1. One unit of the third order, four of the second.
2. Three units of the fifth order, two of the third, one of
the first.
3. Eight units of the fourth order, five of the second.
4. Two units of the seventh order, nine of the sixth, four
of the third, one of the second, seven of the first
.
5. Three units of the sixth order, four of the second.
6. Nino units of the eighth order, six of the seventh, three
of the fifth, seven of the fourth, nine of the first.
7. Four units of the tenth order, six of the eighth, four
of the seventh, two of the sixth, one of the third, five of the
second.
8. Eight units of the twelfth order, four of the eleventh,
six of the tenth, nine of the seventh, three of the sixth, five
of the fifth, two of the third, eight of the first.
Units of different orders are what!
17
32. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations,
several important principles are derived, which we will now
present.
1st. Figures have two values, Simple and Local.
The Simple Value of a figure is its value when taken
alone; thus, 2, 5, 8.
The Local Value of a figure is its value when used with
another figure or figures in the same number; thus, in 842
the simple values of the several figures are 8, 4, and 2 ; but
the local value of the 8 is 800; of the 4 is 4 tens, or 40 j
and of the 2 is 2 units.
When a figure occupies units' place, its simple and local values are the same.
2d. A digit or figure, if used in the second place, ex-
presses tens; in the third place, hundreds; in the fourth
place, thousands; and so on.
3d. As 10 units make 1 ten, 10 tens 1 hundred, 10 hun-
dreds 1 thousand, and 10 units of any order, or in any place,
make one unit of the next higher order, or in the next „
place at the left, wo readily see that the Arabic method of
notation is based upon the following
Two General Laws.
I. The value of units of the different orders increases from
right to left, and decreases from left to right, in a tenfold
ratio.
II. Every removal of a figure one place to the left, increases
its local value tenfold; and every removal of a figure one place
to the right, diminishes its local value tenfold.
Thus,'
6 is 6 units.
60 is 10 times 6 units.
600 is 10 times 6 tens.
6000 is 10 times 6 hundreds.
60000 is 10 times 6 thousands.
First principle derived? What is the simple value of a figure? Local?
Second principle? Third 1 First law of Arabic notation? Second?
4th. The local value of a figure depends upon its place
from units of the first order, not upon the value of the
figures at the right of it. Thus, in 425 and 400, the value
of the 4 is the same in both numbers, being 4 units of the
third order, or 4 hundred.
Care should be taken not to mistake the local value of a figure for the value of the
whole number. For, although the value of the 4 (hundreds) is the same in the two
numbers. 425 and 400, the value of the whole of the first number is greater than that
tf the second.
5th. Every period contains three figures (units, tens, and
hundreds), except the left hand period, which sometimes
contains only one or two figures (units, or units and tens).
33. As all the principles upon which the writing and
reading of whole numbers depend have now been analyzed,
we will present these principles in the form of rules.
Rule for Notation.
I. Beginning at the left hand, write the figures belonging
to the highest period.
II. Write the hundreds, tens, and units of each successive
period in their order, placing a cipher wherever an order
of units is omitted.
Rule for Numeration.
I. Separate the number into periods of three figures each,
commencing at the right hand.
II. Beginning at the left hand, read each period separately,
and give the name to each period, except the last, or period
of xinits.
34. Until the pupil can write numbers readily, it may be
well for him to write several periods of ciphers, point them
off, and over each period write its name; thus,
Trillions, Billions, Millions, Thousands, Units.
000, 00 0, 000, 000, 000,

for notation? Numeration t
and then write the given numbers underneath, in their
appropriate places.

39. The sign, =, is called the sign of equality. When
placed between two numbers, or sets of numbers, it signifies
that they arc equal to each other; thus, the expression
6 + 4=10, is read 6 plus 4 is equal to 10, and denotes that
the numbers 6 and 4, taken together, equal the number 10.

Analysis. Arrange the numbers so that
units of like order shall stand in the same
column. Then add the columns separately,
for convenience commencing at the right hand,
and write each result under the column added.
Thus, we have 5 and 2 and 2 are 9, the sum of
the units; 2 and 6 are 8, the sum of the tens;
1 and 1 and 1 are 3, the sum of the hundreds.
Hence, the entire amount is 3 hundreds 8 tena
and 9 units, or 389.

operation. Analysis. Arranging the num-
bers us in Case I, we first add the
column of units, and find the sum to
be 17 units, which is 1 ten and 7
units. Write the 7 units in the place
of units, and the 1 ten in the place of
tens. The sum of the figures in the
column of tens is 15 tens, which is 1
hundred, and 5 tens. Write the
5 tens in the place of tens, and the
1 hundred in the place of hundreds.
Next add the column of hundreds,
and find the sum to be 14 hundreds,
which is 1 thousand and 4 hundreds. Write the 4 hundreds in the
place of hundreds, and 1 thousand in the place of thousands. Lastly,
by uniting the sum of the units with the sums of the tens and hun-
dreds, we find the total amount to be 1 thousand 5 hundreds 6 tens

In any colnmn is 10 or more than 10, it produces one or more unite of a higher order,
which must be added to the next column. This process is sometimes called "car-
rying the tens."
2. In adding, learn to pronounce the partial results without naming the numbers
separately; thus, instead of saying 7 and 5 aro 12, and 5 are 17, simply pronounce
the results, 7,12,17, etc.

What is meant by carry-
42. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers to be added so that the units
of the same order shall stand in the same column; that is,
units under units, tens under tens, etc.
II. Commencing at units, add each column separately, and
write the sum underneath, if it be less than ten.
IIL If the sum of any column be ten or more than ten, writt
the unit figure only, and add the ten or tens to the next column.
IV. Write the entire sum of the last column.
Proof. 1st. Begin with the right hand or unit column,
and add the figures in each column in an opposite direction
from that in which they were first added; if the two results
agree, the work is supposed to be right. Or,
2d. Separate the numbers added into two sets, by a hori-
zontal line; find the sum of each set separately; add these
sums, and if the amount be the same as that first obtained,
the work is presumed to be correct.
By the methods of proof here given, the numbers are muted In new combina-
tions, which render it almost impossible for two precisely similar mistakes to
occur.
The first method is the one commonly used In business.

47. The Difference or Remainder is the result ob-
tained by the process of subtraction.
The minuend and subtrahend must be like numbers; thus, 5 dollars from 9 dol-
lars leave 4 dollars; 5 apples from 9 apples, leave 4 apples; but it would be absurd
to say 5 apples from 9 dollars, or 6 dollars from 9 apples.
48. The sign, —, is called minus, which signifies less.
When placed between two numbers, it denotes that the one
after it is to be taken from the one before it. Thus, 8—6
=2 is read 8 minus 6 equals 2, and shows that 6, the sub-
trahend, taken from 8, the minuend, equals 2, the
remainder.

Operation. Analysis. Since we cannot take 9 units from 8
units, we add 10 units to 6 units, making 16 units;
- 9 units from 16 units leave 7 units. But as we have
g added 10 units, or 1 ten, to the minuend, we shall
have a remainder 1 ten too large, to avoid which, we
add 1 ten to the 5 tens in the subtrahend, making 6
4.8 7 tens. We can not take 6 tens from 4 tens; so we
add 10 tens to 4, making 14 tens; 6 tens from 14
tens leave 8 tens. Now, having added 10 tens, or 1 hundred, to the
minuend, we shall have a remainder 1 hundred too large, unless we
add 1 hundred to the 3 hundreds in the subtrahend, making 4 hun-
dreds; 4 hundreds from 8 hundreds leave 4 hundreds, and we have
for the total remainder, 487, the same as before.
Case II is what? Give explanation. Second explanation.
SIMPLE NUMBERS.
The process of adding 10 to the minuend is sometimes called borrowing 10, and
that of adding 1 to the next figure of the subtrahend, carrying one.
51. From the preceding illustrations we hare the fol-
lowing
Rule. I. Write the less number under the greater, pla&
ing units of the same order in the same column.
II. Begin at the right hand, and take each figure of the
subtrahend from the figure above it, and write the result un-
derneath.
III. If any figure in the subtrahend be greater than the
corresponding figure above it, add 10 to that upper figure be-
fore subtracting, and then add 1 to the next left hand figure
of the subtrahend.
Proof. Add the remainder to the subtrahend, and if
their sum he equal to the minuend, the work is supposed
to be right.

OPERATION.
Case I
.
60. When the multiplier consists of one figure.
L Multiply 374 by 6.
Analysis. In this example it is
required to take 374 six times. If we
take the units of each order 6 times,
we shall take the entire number (
times. Therefore, writing the multi
plier under the unit figure of the mul-
tiplicand, we proceed as follows: 0
times 4 units are 24 units; 6 times 7
tens are 42 tens; 6 times 3 hundreds
are 18 hundreds; and adding these
partial products, we obtain the entire
product, 2844.

The operation in this example may bo performed in an-
other way, which is the one in common use.
operation. Analysis. Writing tho numbers as before, begin
3^ at the right hand or unit figure, and say: 0 times 4
q units are 24 units, which is 2 tens and 4 units; write
the 4 units in the product in units' place, and reserve
2244 the 2 tens to add to the next product; 0 times 7 tens
are 42 tens, and the two tens reserved in the last
product added, are 44 tens, which is 4 hundreds and 4 tens; write tho
4 tens in the product in tens' place, and reserve the 4 hundreds to add
to the next product; 0 times 3 hundreds are 18 hundreds, and 4 hun-
dreds added are 23 hundreds, which being written in the product in
the places of hundreds and thousands, gives, for the entire product,
2244.
61. The unit value of a number is not changed by re-
peating tho number. As the multiplier always expresses
times, the product must have the same unit value as the
multiplicand. But since the product of any two numbers
will be the same, whichever factor is taken as a multiplier,
either factor may be taken for the multiplier or multiplicand.
In multiplying, learn to pronounce the partial results, as in addition, without
naming* the numbers separately; thus, in the last example, instead cf saying 6 times
4 are 24, G times 7 are 42 and 2 to carry are 44, 6 times 3 arc IS and 4 to carry are 22,
pronounce only the results, 24, 44, 22, performing the operations mentally. This
will greatly facilitate the process of multiplying.

by multiplying by each figure are called partial products.
2. When there are ciphers between the significant figures of the multiplier, pass
over them, and multiply by the significant figures only.
63. From the preceding examples and illustrations we
deduce the following general
Rule. I. Write the multiplier under the multiplicand, plac-
ing units of the same order under each other.
II. Multiply the multiplicand by each figure of the multi-
plier successively, beginning with the unit figure, and write
the first figure of each partial product under the figure of the
multiplier used, writing down and carrying as in addition.
III. If there are partial products, add them, and their sum
will be the product required.
64. Proof. I. Multiply the multiplier by the multipli-
cand, and if the product is the same as the first result, the
work is correct. Or,
2. Multiply the multiplicand by the multiplier diminished
by 1, and to the product add the multiplicand; if the sum
be the same as the product by the whole of the multiplier,
the work is correct.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
CONTKACTIOTsTS.
Case I
.
65. "When the multiplier is a composite number.
A Composite Number is one that may be produced by
multiplying together two or more numbers; thus, 18 is a
composite number, since 6x3 = 18; or, 9 x 2 = 18; or,
3 x 3 x 2 = 18.
66. The Component Factors of a number are the sev-
eral numbers which, multiplied together, produce the given
number; thus, the component factors of 20 are 10 and 2
(10x2=20); or, 4 and 5 (4x5=20); or, 2 and 2 and 5
(2x2x5=20).
The pupil mnst not confound the factors with the parts of a number. Thus, the
factors of which 12 is composed, are 4 and 3 (4 x 3= 12); while the parts of which 12
is composed are 8 and 4 (8+4=12), or 10 and 2 (10+2=12). The factors are multi-
plied, while the parts are added, to produce the number.

72. Division is the process of finding how many times
one number is contained in another.
73. The Dividend is the number to be divided.
74. The Divisor is the number to divide by.
75. The Quotient is the result obtained by the process
of division, and shows how many times the divisor is con-
tained in the dividend.
1. When the dividend does not contain the divisor an exact number of limes, the
part of the dividend left is called the remainder, and it must be less than the
divisor.
2. As the remainer is always a part of the dividend, it is always of the same name
or kind.
8. When there is no remainder the division 1b said to he exact.
76. The sign, -4-, placed between two numbers, denotes
division, and shows that the number on the left is to be di-
vided by the number on the right. Thus, 20-v-4=5, is read,
20 divided by 4 is equal to 5.
Division is also indicated by writing the dividend above,
. . 12
and the divisor below a short horizontal line; thus,
shows that 12 divided by 3 equals 4.

but the method of doing it cannot be explained until we reach
Fractions; so we merely indicate the division by placing the divisor
under the dividend, thus, f. The entire quotient is written 235f,
which may be read, two hundred thirty-five and three divided by four,

V. If there be a remainder after dividing the last figure,
place it over the divisor at the right hand of the quotient.
Proof. Multiply the divisor and quotient together, and
to the product add the remainder, if any; if the result be
equal to the dividend, the work is correct.
1. This method of proof depends on the feet that division is the reverse of multi-
plication. The dividend answers to the product, the divisor to one of the factors,
and the quotient to the other. •

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
1. How many times is 8 contained in 2528?
operation. Analysis. As 8 is not contained in 2 thou-
8 ) 2528 ( 316 sands, we take 2 and 5 as one number, and
24. consider how many times 8 is contained in this
partial dividend, 25 hundreds, and find that it
12 is contained 3 hundreds times, and a remainder.
8 To find this remainder, we multiply the divisor,
8, by the quotient figure, 3 hundreds, and sub
tract the product, 24 hundreds, from the par
tial dividend, 25 hundreds, and there remains
1 hundred. To this remainder we bring down
the 2 tens of the dividend, and consider the 12 tens a second partial
dividend. Then, 8 is contained in 12 tens 1 ten time and a remain-
der; 8 multiplied by 1 ten produces 8 tens, which, subtracted from
12 tens, leave 4 tens. To this remainder we bring down the 8 units,
and consider the 48 units the third partial dividend. Then, 8 is con-
tained in 48 units 0 units times. Multiplying and subtracting as
before, we find that nothing remains, and the entire quotient is 31G.
2. How many times is 23 contained in 4807?

23 ) 4807 ( 209 the first partial dividend, and place
46 the result in the quotient on the
right of the dividend. We then
multiply the divisor, 23, by the
quotient figure, 2, and subtract the
product, 46, from the part of the
dividend used, and to the remainder bring down the next figure of
the dividend, which is 0, making 20, for the second partial dividend.
Then, since 23 is contained in 20 no times, we place a cipher in the
quotient, and bring down the next figure of the dividend, making a
third partial dividend, 207; 23 is contained in 207, 9 times; multiply-
ing and subtracting as before, nothing remains, and the entire quo-
tient is 209.

From the preceding illustrations we derive the following
general
Rule. I. Write the divisor at the left of the dividend, as
in short division.
II. Divide the least number of the left hand figures in the
dividend that will contain the divisor one or more times, and
place the quotient at the right of tlie dividend, with a line
"between them.
III. Multiply the divisor by this quotient figure, subtract
the product from the partial dividend used, and to the re-
mainder bring down the next figure of the dividend.
IV. Divide as before, until all the figures of the dividend
have been brought down and divided.
V. If any partial dividend will not contain the divisor,
place a cipher in the quotient, and bring down the next figure
of the dividend, and divide as before.
VL If there be a remainder after dividing all the figures
of the dividend, it must be written in the quotient, with the
divisor underneath.
1. If any remainder be equal to, or greater than the divisor, the quotient figure 1b
too smalls and must be increased.
8. If the product of the divisor by the quotient figure be greater than the partial
dividend, the quotient figure is too large, and mnst be diminished.

671 being a quotient arising from dividing by 2, its units are 2 timee
as great in value as the units of the given dividend, 1143. Dividing
the 571 by 8, we have a quotient of 71, and a remainder of 3 undi-
vided. As this 3 is a part of the 571, it must be multiplied by 2 to
change it to the same kind of units as the 1. This makes a true re-
mainder of 6 arising from dividing by 8. Dividing the 71 by 4, we
have a quotient of 17, and a remainder of 3 undivided. This 3 is a part
of the 71, the units of which aie 8 times as great in value as those of
the 571, and the units of the 571 are 2 times as great in value as those
of the given dividend, 1143; therefore, to change this last remainder,
3, to units of the same value as the dividend, we multiply it by 8 and
2, and obtain a true remainder of 48 arising from dividing by 4.
Adding the three partial remainders, we obtain 55, the true remainder.

trary, by cutting off or taking away
the right hand figure of a number, each of the other figures is removed
one place toward the right, and, consequently, the value of each is
diminished tenfold, or divided by 10 (32).
For similar reasons, if we cut off two figures, we divide by
100, if three, we divide by 1000, and so on.
Rule. From the right hand of the dividend cut off as
many figures as there are ciphers in the divisor. Under the
figures so cut off, place the divisor, and the whole will form
(he quotient.

will be the true remainder.

SIMPLE NUMBERS.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIVISION.
86. The quotient in Division depends upon the relative
values of the dividend and divisor. Hence any change in the
-?alue of either dividend or divisor must produce a change
in the value of the quotient. But some changes may be
produced upon both dividend and divisor, at the same time,
that will not affect the quotient. The laws which govern
these changes are called General Principles of Division,
which we will now examine.
I . 54-r-9 = 6.
Multiplying the dividend by 3, we have
54 x 3 -r- 9 = 162 9 = 18,
and 18 equals the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence,
Multiplying the dividend by any number, multiplies the quo-
tient by the same number.
II. Using the same example, 54 -7- 9 = 6.
Dividing the dividend by 3 we have
^--=-9 = 18^-9 = 2,
and 2 — the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Dividing the
dividend by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
III. Multiplying the divisor by 3, we have
54 9 x 3 = 54 + 27 = 2,
and 2 = the quotient, 6, divided by 3. Hence, Multiplying
the divisor by any number, divides the quotient by the same
number.
IV. Dividing the divisor by 3, we have
54 -f-1 = 54 3 = 18,
Upon what does the value of the quotient depend? What is the
first general principle of division? Second? Third? Fourth 1
and 18 = the quotient, 6, multiplied by 3. Hence, Divid-
ing the divisor by any number, multiplies the quotient by the
same number.
V. Multiplying both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
54 x 3 4- 9 x 3 = 162 27 = 6.
Hence, Multiplying both dividend and divisor by t?ie same
number, does not alter the value of the quotient.
VI. Dividing both dividend and divisor by 3, we have
Y-M = 18H-3 = 6.
Hence, Dividing both dividend and divisor by the same num-
ber, does not alter the value of the quotient.
87. These six examples illustrate all the different changes
we ever have occasion to make upon the dividend and divi-
sor in practical arithmetic. The principles upon which
these changes are based may be stated as follows:
Phis'. I. Multiplying the dividend multiplies the quotient;
and dividing the dividend divides the quotient. (86.1 and II.)
Prin. II. Multiplying the divisor divides the quotient;
and dividing the divisor multiplies the quotient. (86. Ill
and IV.)
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both dividend and
divisor by the same number, does not alter the quotient. (86.
V and VI.)
88. These three principles may be embraced in one
General Law.
A change in the dividend produces a like change in the
quotient; but a change in the divisor produces an opposite
change in the quotient.
If a number be multiplied aDd the product divided by the Bame number, the quo?
tlent Will be equal to the number multiplied. Thus, 15 x 4=60, and 60-i-4=l6.
Fifth? Sixth? Into how many general principles can these be
condensed? What is the first? Second? Third? In what general
law are these embraced?
PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS.
EXACT DIVISOKS.
89. An Exact Divisor of a number is one that gives
a whole number for a quotient.
As it is frequently desirable to know if a number has an
exact divisor, we will present a few directions that will be
of assistance, particularly in finding exact divisors of large
numbers.
A number whose unit figure is 0, 2,4, 6, or 8, is called an Even Number. And a
comber whose unit figure is 1,3,5,7, or 9, is called an Odd Number.
2 is an exact divisor of all even numbers.
4 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the tens
and units of a number. Thus, 4 is an exact divisor of 268,
756, 1284.
5 is an exact divisor of every number whose unit figure is
0 or 5. Thus, 5 is an exact divisor of 20, 955, and 2840.
8 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the hun-
dreds, tens, and units of a number. Thus, 8 is an exact
divisor of 1728, 5280, and 213560.
9 is an exact divisor when it will exactly divide the sum of
the digits of a number. Thus, in 2486790, the sum of the
digits 2+4 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 0=36, and 36h-9=4.
10 is an exact divisor when 0 occupies units' place.
100 when 00 occupy the places of units and tens.
1000 when 000 occupy the places of units, tens, and hun-
dreds, etc.
A composite number is an exact divisor of any number,
when all its factors are exact divisors of the same number.
Thus, 2, 2, and 3 are exact divisors of 12; and so also are 4
(=2x2) and 6 (=2x3).
An even number is not an exact divisor of an odd number.
If an odd number is an exact divisor of an even number.
What is an exact divisor? What is an even number? An odd num-
ber? When is 2 an exact divisor? 4? 5? 9? 10? 100? 1000?
When is a composite number an exact divisor? An even number is
not an exact divisor of what? An odd number is an exact divisor of
what?
67
twice that odd number is also an exact divisor of the even
number. Thus, 7 is an exact divisor of 42 j so also is 7 x 2,
or 14.
PRIME NUMBERS.

factor, 7, and obtain the quotient 11; this being
a prime number, the division can not be carried
further. The divisors and last quotient, 2, 2, 3,

CANCELLATION.
93. Cancellation is the process of rejecting equal fac-
tors from numbers sustaining to each other the relation of
dividend and divisor.
It has been shown (77) that the dividend is equal to the
product of the divisor multiplied by the quotient. Hence,
if the dividend can be resolved into two factors, one of
which is the divisor, the other factor will be the quotient.

PKOPEBTIES OF NUMBERS.
94. Whenever the dividend and divisor arc each com-
posite numbers, the factors common to both may first be
rejected without altering the final result. (87, Prin. III.)
2. "What is the quotient of 24 times 56 divided by 7 times

by writing the num-
bers which constitute the dividend above a line, and those which con-
stitute the divisor below it. Instead of multiplying 24 by 56, in the
dividend, we resolve 24 into the factors 4 and 0, and 56 into the factors
7 and 8; and 48 in the divisor into the factors 6 and 8. We next
cancel the factors 6, 7, and 8, which are common to the dividend and
divisor, and wo have left the factor 4 in the dividend, which is the
quotient.
When all the factors or numbers in the dividend are canceled, 1 should be
retained.
95. If any two numbers, one in the dividend and one in
the divisor, contain a common factor, we may reject that
factor.

II. Cancel all the factors common to both dividend and

III. Divide the product of the remaining factors of the
dividend by the product of the remaining factors of the di-
visor, and the result will be the quotient.
1. Rejecting a factor from any number is dividing the number by that (actor.
2. When a factor is canceled, the unit, 1, is supposed to take ite place.
3. One factor in the dividend will cancel only one equal factor in the divisor.
4. If all the factors or numbers of the divisor are canceled, the product of the
remaining factors of the dividend will be the quotient.
5. By many it is thought more convenient to write the factors of the dividend on
the right of a vertical line, and the factors of the divisor on the left.

1. What is the greatest common divisor of 84 and 203?
Analysis. Draw two vertical lines, and
place the larger number on the right, and
the smaller number ou the left, one line
lower down. Then divide 203, the larger
number, by 84, the smaller, and write 2,
the quotient, between the verticals, the
j£ product, 168, opposite, under the greater
number, and the remainder, 35, below.
Next divide 84 by this remainder, writing
the quotient, 2, between the verticals, the
product, 70, on the left, and the new remainder, 14, below the 70.
Again divide the last divisor, 35, by 14, and obtain 2 for a quotient,
28 for a product, and 7 for a remainder, all of which we write in the
same order as in the former steps. Finally, divide the last divisor,
14, by the last remainder, 7, and we have no remainder. 7, the last
divisor, is the greatest common divisor of the given numbers.

know that the greatest common divisor, whatever it be, must divide
2 times 84, or 168, (I.) Then
since it will divide both 168 and
203, it must divide their differ-
ence, 35, (III.) It will also divide
2 times 35, or 70, (I;) and as it will
divide both 70 and 84, it must di-

will also divide 2 times 14 or 28,

greater than 7.

Thus we have shown,
1st. That 7 is a common divisor of the given numbers.
2d. That their greatest common divisor, whatever it be,
cannot be greater than 7. Hence it must be 7.
From this example and analysis, we derive the following
Rule. I. Draw two verticals, and write the two numbers,
one on each side, the greater number one line above the less.
II. Divide the greater number by the less, writing the quo-
tient between the verticals, the jjroduct under the dividend,

III. Divide the less number by the remainder, the last di-

The last divisor will be the greatest common divisor sought.

PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS.
103. From the definition (100) it is evident that the
product of two or more numbers, or any number of times
their product, must be a common multiple of the numbers.
Hence, A common multiple of two or more numbers may be
found by multiplying the given numbers together.
104. To find the least common multiple.
First Method.
From the nature of prime numbers we derive the follow-
ing principles:
I. If a number exactly contain another, it will contain all
the prime factors of that number.
II. If a number exactly contain two or more numbers, it
will also contain all the prime factors of those numbers.
III. The least number that will exactly contain all the
prime factors of two or more numbers, is the least common
multiple of those numbers.

factors of 30 except the factor 5. Annexing 5 to the series of factors,
2 x 3 x 13 x 11 x 7 x 5,
and we have all the prime factors of each of the given numbers; and
hence the product of the series of factors is a common multiple of the
given numbers, (II.) And as no factor of this series can be omitted
without omitting a factor of one of the given numbers, the product of
the series is the least common multiple of the given numbers, (III.)
From this example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Resolve the given numbers into their prime
factors.
II. Take all the prime factors of the largest number, and
such prime factors of the other numbers as are not found in
the largest number, and their product will be the least com-
mon multiple.
When a prime factor is repeated in any of the given nnmbers, it must be used as
many times, as a factor of the multiple, as the greatest number of times it appears
in any of the given numbers.

operation. Analysis. First write the
given numbers in a series, with
a vertical line at the \ett.
Since 2 is a factor of some of
the given numbers, it must be
a factor of the least common
multiple sought. Dividing as
many of the numbers as are
divisible by 2, write the quo-
tients and the undivided number, 9, in a line underneath. We now
perceive that some of the numbers in the second line contain the
factor 2; hence the least common multiple must contain another 2,
and we again divide by 2, omitting to write down any quotient when
it is 1. We next divide by 3 for a like reason, and still again by 3.
By this process we have transferred all the factors of each of the
numbers to the left of the vertical; and their product, 36, must be the
least common multiple sought, (104, III.)

we divide every number
that is divisible by either of these factors or by their product; thus, we
divide 10 by both 2 and 5; 12 by 2; 15 by 5; and 75 by 5. We next
divide the second line in like manner by 2 and 3; and afterwards the
third line by 5. By this process we collect the factors of the given
numbers into groups; and the product of the factors at the left of the

Analysis. In this opera-

because they are exactly con-

contained in 42, and 35 in
70; and whatever will contain 42 and 70 must contain 6 and 35.
Hence we have only to find the least common multiple of the remain,
ing numbers, 15, 42, and 70.
From these examples we derive the following
Rule. I. Write the numbers in a line, omitting any of the
smaller numbers that are factors of the larger, and draw a
vertical line at the left.
II. Divide by any prime factor, or factors, that may be con-
tained in one or more of the given numbers, and write the
quotients and undivided numbers in a line underneath, omit-
ting the Vs.
III. In like manner divide the quotients and undivided
numbers, and continue the process till all the factors of the
given numbers have been transferred to the left of the vertical.
Then multiply these factors together, and their product will
be the least common multiple required.

108. III. As Integral and Fractional.
An Integral Number, or Integer, expresses whole
things. Thus, 281; 78 boys; 1000 books.
A Fractional Number, or Fraction, expresses equal
parts of a thing. Thus, half a dollar; three-fourths of an
hour; seven-eighths of a mile.
109. IV. As Abstract and Concrete.
110. V. As Simple and Compound.
A Simple Number is either an abstract number, or a
concrete number of but one denomination. Thus 48, 926;
48 dollars, 926 miles.
A Compound Number is a concrete number whose value

32 dollars 15 cents; 15 days 4 hours 25 minutes; 7 miles

111. VI. As Like and Unlike.
Like Numbers are numbers of the same unit value.
If simple numbers, they must be all abstract, as 6, 62,
487; or all of one and the same denomination, as 5 apples,
62 apples, 487 apples; and, if compound numbers, tlicy
must be used to express the same kind of quantity, as time,
distance, etc. Thus, 4 weeks 3 days 16 hours; 1 week 6
days 9 hours; 5 miles 40 rods; 2 miles 100 rods.
Unlike Numbers are numbers of different unit values.
Thus, 75, 140 dollars, and 28 miles; 4 hours 30 minutes,
and 5 bushels 1 peck.

112. If a unit be divided into 2 equal parts, one of the
parts is called one-half.
If a unit be divided into 3 equal parts, one of the parts ip
called one-third, two of the parts two-thirds.
If a unit be divided into 4 equal parts, one of, the parts
is called one-fourth^ two of the parts two-fourths, three of
the parts three-fourths.
If a unit be divided into 5 equal parts, one of the parts
Is called one-fifth, two of the parts two-fifths, three of the
parts three-fifths, etc.
The parts are expressed by figures; thus,

Hence we see that the parts into which a unit is divided
take their name, and their value, from the number of equal
parts into which the unit is divided. Thus, if we divide
an orange into 2 equal parts, the parts are called halves;
if into 3 equal parts, thirds j if into 4 equal parts, fourths,
etc.; and each third is less in value than each half, and
each fourth less than each third j and the greater the nwm-
ier of parts, the less their value.
When a unit is divided into any number of equal parts,
one or more such parts is a fractional part of the whole
number, and is called a fraction. Hence,
if 113. A Fraction is one or more of the equal parts of a
unit.
Define a fraction.
114. To write a fraction, two integers are required, one
to express the number of parts into which the whole num-
ber is divided, and the other to express the number of these
parts taken. Thus, if one dollar be divided into 4 equal
parts,' the parts are called fourths, and three of these parts
are called three-fourths of a dollar. This three-fourths may
be written
3 the number of parts taken.
4 the number of parts into which the dollar is divided.
115. The Denominator is the number below the line.
It denominates or names the parts; and
It shows how many parts are equal to a unit.
116. The Numerator is the number above the line.
It numerates or numbers the parts; and
It shows how many parts are taken or expressed by the
fraction.
117. The Terms of a fraction are the numerator and
denominator, taken together.
118. Fractions indicate division, the numerator answer-
ing to the dividend, and the denominator to the divisor.
119. The Value of a fraction is the quotient of the nu-
merator divided by the denominator.
120. To analyze a fraction is to designate and describe
its numerator and denominator. Thus, £ is analyzed as
follows :—
4 is the denominator, and shows that the integer is divided
into 4 equal parts; it is the divisor.
3 is the numerator, and shows that 3 parts are taken; it
is the dividend, or integer divided.
3 and 4 are the terms, considered as dividend and divisor.
The value of the fraction is the quotient of 3-^4, or £.

121. Fractions are distinguished as Proper and Improper.
A Proper Fraction is one whose numerator is less than
its denominator; its value is less than the unit, 1. Thus,
tV, A, are proper fractions.
An Improper Fraction is one whose numerator equals
or exceeds its denominator; its value is never less than the
unit, 1. Thus, $, -, fj, iffl are improper fractions.
122. A Mixed Number is a number expressed by an in-
teger and a fraction; thus, 4£, 17-J-f, 9^ are mixed numbers.

terms of a fraction will affect the value of that fraction ac-
cording to the laws of division ; and we have only to modify

We see in the operation that we have multiplied the dividend by
the denominator of the divisor, and divided the result by the numer-
ator of the divisor, which is in accordance with 140 for dividing a
fraction. Hence, by inverting the terms of the divisor, the two frac-
tions will stand in such relation to each other that we can multiply
together the two upper numbers for the numerator of the quotient,
and the two lower numbers for the denominator, as shown in the
operation. For division of fractions, we have this general
Rule. I. Reduce integers and mixed numbers to improper
fractions.
II. Invert the terms of the divisor, and proceed as in mul-

2. Decimal fractions are commonly called decimals.
8. Since = -tfg, = -j-J^, etc., the denominators of decimal fractions in-
crease and decrease in a tenfold ratio, the same as simple numbers.
Decimal Notation and Numeration.
144. Common Fractions are the common divisions of
a unit into any number of equal parts, as into halves, fifths,
twenty-fourths, etc.
Decimal Fractions are the decimal divisions of a unit,
thus: A unit is divided into ten equal parts, called tenths;
each of these tenths is divided into ten other equal parts,
called hundredths; each of these hundredths into ten other
equal parts, called thousandtlis; and so on. Since the de-
nominators of decimal fractions increase and decrease by the
scale of 10, the same as simple numbers, in writing decimals
the denominators may be omitted.
In simple numbers, the unit, 1, is the starting point of
notation and numeration; and so also is it in decimals. We
extend the scale of notation to the left of units' place in
writing integers, and to the right of units' place in writing
decimals. Thus, the first place at the left of units is tens,
and the first place at the right of units is tenths ; the second
place at the left is hundreds, and the second place at tho
right is hundredths; the third place at the left in thousands,
and the third place at the right is thousandths; and so on.

fractions? How are they written t

The Decimal Point is a period (.), which must always be
placed before or at the left hand of the decimal. Thus,
-fo is expressed .6
"" -54
tWf" " -279
The decimal point is nlso called the Separatrix. This is a correct name for it
only when it stands between the integral and decimal parts of the same number.
.5 is 5 tenths, which = ^ of 5 units;
.05 is 5 hundredths, "= -jV of 5 tenths;
.005 is 5 thousandths, "= of 5 hundredths.
And universally, the value of a figure in any decimal place
is the value of the same figure in the next left hand place.
The relation of decimals and integers to each other is
clearly shown by the following

dredths 100, of thousands 1000, and so on, a decimal may be
expressed by writing the numerator only; but in this case
the numerator or decimal must always contain as many
decimal places as are equal to the number of ciphers in the
denominator; and the denominator of a decimal will always
be the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as are equal to
the number of figures in the decimal or numerator.
The decimal point must never be omitted.
Examples for Practice.

.24 .024 .0005 .001385
.672 .8471 .100248 .1000087
To read a decimal, first numerate from left to right, and the name of the right
hand figure is the name of the denominator. Then numerate from right to left, as
in whole numbers, to read the numerator.
146. A Mixed Number is a number consisting of in-
tegers and decimals; thus, 71.406 consists of the integral
part, 71, and the decimal part, .406; it is read the same as
71tWV, 71 and 406 thousandths.

147. From the foregoing explanations and illustrations
ire derive the following important
Principles of Decimal Notation and Numeration.
1. The value of any decimal figure depends upon its place
from the decimal point: thus .3 is ten times .03.
2. Prefixing a cipher to a decimal decreases its value the
Bame as dividing it by ten; thus, .03 is ^ the value of .3.
3. Annexing a cipher to a decimal does not alter its value,
since it does not change the place of the significant figures
of the decimal; thus, or .6, is the same as or .60.
4. Decimals increase from right to left, and decrease from
left to right, in a tenfold ratio; and therefore they may be
added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the same as whole
numbers.
5. The denominator of a decimal, though nevei expressed,
is always the unit, 1, with as many ciphers annexed as there
are figures in the decimal.
6. To read decimals requires two numerations; first, from
units, to find the name of the denominator, and second, to-
wards units, to find the value of the numerator.
148. Having analyzed all the principles upon which the
writing and reading of decimals depend, we will now pre-
sent these principles in the form of rules.

operation. Analysis. The given decimals must contain
.50000 as many places each, as are equal to the greatest
37500 number of decimal figures in any of the given
3 25401 decimals. We find that the third number con-
tains five decimal places, and hence 100000 must
be a common denominator. As annexing ciphers
to decimals does not alter their value, (144, 3)
we give to each number five decimal places by annexing ciphers, and
thus reduce the given decimals to a common denominator.
Rule. Give to each number the same number of decimal
places, by annexing ciphers.
1. If the numbers be reduced to the denominator of that one of the given nam
bers having the greatest number of decimal places, they will have their least com.

2. A whole number may readily be reduced to decimals by placing the decimal
point after units, and annexing ciphers; one cipher reducing it to tenths, two
ciphers to hundredths, three ciphers to thousandths, and so on.

The Coin of the United States consists of gold, silver,
nickel, and bronze.
T7te Gold Coins are the double-eagle, eagle, half-eagle,
quarter-eagle, three-dollar and one-dollar pieces.
Tlie Silver Coins are the dollar, half-dollar, quarter-dcl-
lar, the twenty-cent, and ten-cent pieces.
TJie Hickel Coins are the five-cent and three-cent pieces.
TJie Bronze Coins are the one-cent pieces.

1. The mill is a denomination used only in computations; it is not a coin.
2. The Irade-doltar (s designed solely for commerce, and not for currency. Its
freight is 420 grains. The weight of the currency dollar of 1878 is 412} grains.
3. The character $ is supposed to be a contraction of U. S. (United States), the
U being placed upon the S.
What is coin? Currency? Decimal currency? Federal money?

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
159. The gold dollar is the unit of United States money;
dimes, cents, and mills are fractions of a dollar, and are
separated from the dollar by the decimal point; thus, two
dollars one dime two cents five mills, are written $2,125.
By examining the table, we see that the dime is a tenth
part of the unit, or dollar; the cent a tenth part of the dime
or a hundredth part of the dollar; and the mill a tenth part
if the cent, a hundredth part of the dime, or a thousandth
part of the dollar. Hence the denominations of decimal
currency increase and decrease the same as decimal fractions,
and are expressed according to the same decimal system of
notation; and they may bo added, subtracted, multiplied,
and divided -in the same manner as decimals.
Dimes are not read as dimes, but the two places of dimes
and cents are appropriated to cents; thus, 1 dollar 3 dimes
i cents, or $1.32, are read one dollar thirty-two cents; heDce,
When the number of cents is less than 10, we write a
cipher before it in the place of dimes.
The half cent is frequently written as 5 mills; thns, 24 J cents, written $.243.
160. Business men frequently write cents as common
fractions of a dollar; thus, three dollars thirteen cents are
written §3^$, and read, three and thirteen hundredths
dollars. In business transactions, when the final result of a
computation contains 5 mills or wore, they are called one
cent, and when less than 5, they are rejected.
Examples for Practice.
1. Write four dollars five cents. Arts. $4.05.
2. Write two dollars nine cents.
3. Write ten dollars ten cents.
4. Write eight dollars seven mills. Ans. $8,007.
What is the unit of U. S. currency? What is the general law of
increase and decrease? In practice, how many decimal places are given
to cents? In business transactions, how are cents frequently written 1
What is done if the mills exceed 5? If less than 5?

10. Read $16,205; $215,081; $1000.011; $4,002.
161. By examining the table of Decimal Currency, we
see that 10 mills make one cent, and 100 cents, or 1000
mills, make one dollar; hence,

DECIMAL CURRENCY.
Rule. Divide as in simple numbers, and place the point
in tlie quotient, as in division of decimals.
1. In business transactions it is never necessary to carry the division farther than
to mills in the quotient.
2. If the dividend will not contain the divisor an exact number of times, ciphers
may be annexed, and the division continued as in division of decimals. In this case
it is always safe to reduce the dividend to mills, or to 3 more decimal places than
the divisor contains, before commencing the division.

REDUCTION.
EEDUCTIOK
175. A Compound Number is a number whose valttG
is expressed in two or more different denominations.
176. Reduction is the process of changing a number
from one denomination to another without altering its value.
Reduction is of two kinds, Descending and Ascending.
177. Reduction Descending is changing a number of
one denomination to another denomination of less unit
value; thus, $1=10 dimes=100 cents=1000 mills.
178. Reduction Ascending is changing a number of one
denomination to another denomination of greater unit value j
thus, 1000 mills=100 cents=10 dimes=$l.
179. A Scale is a series of units, increasing or decreas-
ing, according to a certain law.

Canada Monet.
The currency of the Dominion of Canada is decimal, and
the table and denominations are the same as those of the
United States money,
Tho currency of the whole Dominion of Canada was made uniform July 1,1871.
Before the adoption of the decimal system, pounds, shillings, and pence were used.
The Silver Cains are tlie 50-cer.t piece, 25-cent piece, 10-cent piece,
and 5-cent piece. The 20-ccnt piece is no longer coined. The Bronu
Cain is the cent.

Standard of "Weight.
188. In the year 1834 the U. S. government adopted a
uniform standard of weights and measures, for the use of the
custom-houses, and the other branches of business connected
with the general government.
157
189. The United States standard unit of weight is the
Troy pound of the mint, which is the same as the imperial
standard pound of Great Britain, and is determined as fol-
lows : A cubic inch of distilled water* in a vacuum, weighed
by brass weights, also in a vacuum, at a temperature of 62°
Fahrenheit's thermometer, is equal to 252.458 grains, of
which the standard Troy pound contains 5760.
190. The IT. 8. Avoirdupois pound is determined from
the standard Troy pound, and contains 700O Troy grains.
Hence, the Troy pound is 4$t# = of an avoirdupois
pound. But the "Troy ounce contains 6= 480 grains,
and the avoirdupois ounce i j jj° = 437.5 grains; and an ounce
Troy is 480—437.5=42.5 grains greater than an ounce avoir-
dupois. The pound, ounce, and grain, Apothecaries' weight,
are the same as the like denominations in Troy weight, the only
difference in the two tables being in the divisions of the ounce.
191. Comparative Table op Weights.
Troy. Apothecaries'. Avoirdnpois.
1 pound =: C760 grains, — 5760 grains, := 7000 grains.

175 pounds, = 175 pounds, = 144 pounds.
Examples for Practice.
1. An apothecary bought 5 lb. 10 oz. of rhubarb, by
avoirdupois weight, at 50 cents an ounce, and retailed it at
12 cents a dram apothecaries' weight; what did he gain?
2. Change 424 drams apothecaries' weight to Troy weight.
3. Change 20 lb. 8 oz. 12 pwt. Troy weight to avoirdu-

4. Bought by avoirdupois weight 20 lb. of opium, at 40
cents an ounce, and sold the same by Troy weight at 50
cents an ounce ; what did he gain? Ans. $17.83|.
What is the U. S. standard of weight 1 How obtained? How is
the avoirdupois pound determined? How is the apothecaries' pound
determined? What are the values of the denominations of Troy,
avoirdupois, and apothecaries' weight?

MEASURES OF EXTENSION.
192. Extension has one or more of the dimensions—

1 square foot is a figure having
four sides of 1 ft. or 12 in. each, as
shown in the diagram. Its contents
are 12 x 12 = 144 square inches.
Hence,
The contents or area of a square,
or of any other figure having a uni-
form length and a uniform breadth,
is found by multiplying the length by the breadth. Thus, a
square foot is 12 in. long and 12 in. wide, and the contents
are 12 x 12 = 144 square inches. A board 20 in. long and
10 in. wide is a rectangle, containing 20 x 10 = 200 square
inches.
196. Square Measure is used in computing areas or
surfaces; as of land, boards, painting, plastering, paving, etc.

Analysis. Dividing by the numbers in the ascending scale, and
arranging the remainders according to their order in a line below, we
find the square yards a mixed number, 15 J. But J of a sq. yd. = f of
0 sq. ft. = 6| sq. ft.; and -f of a sq. ft. = f of 144 sq, in. = 108 sq. in.
Therefore -J cq. yd. = 6 sq. ft. 108 sq. in.; and adding 108 sq. in. to
28 sq. in. we have 136 sq. in., and 6 sq. ft. to 7 sq. ft. we have 13 sq.
ft. = 1 sq. yd. 4 sq. ft., and writing the 4 sq. ft. in the result, and

III. Cubic Measure.

198. A Cube is a solid, or body,
having six equal square sides, or
faces. If each side of a cube be 1
yard, or 3 feet, 1 foot in thickness
of this cube will contain 3x3x1
=9 cubic feet, and the whole cube
will contain 3x3x3 = 27 cubic
feet.
A solid, or body, may have the three dimensions all alike
or all different. A body 4 ft. long, 3 ft. wide, and 2 ft. thick
contains 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 cubic or solid feet. Hence,
The cubic or solid contents of a body are found by multi-
plying the length, breadth, and thickness together.
199. Cubic Measure, also called Solid Measure, is used
in estimating the contents of solids, or bodies; as timber,
wood, stone, etc.
Scale—ascending, 1728,27. The other numbers are not in a regular
scale, but are merely so many times 1 foot. The unit equivalents, be-
ing fractional, are consequently omitted.

20?/. Tlie TJ. S. standard unit of measures of extension,
whether linear, superficial, or solid, is the yard of 3 feet, or
36 inches, and is the same as the imperial standard yard of
Great Britain. It is determined as follows: The rod of a
pendulum vibrating seconds of mean time, in the latitude
of London, in a vacuum, at the level of the sea, is divided
into 391393 equal parts, and 360000 of these parts are 36
inches, or 1 standard yard. Hence, such a pendulum rod
is 39.1393 inches long, and the standard yard is jjjj g g g g of
the length of the pendulum rod.
203. The TJ. 8. standard unit of liquid measure is the
vM English wine gallon, of 231 cubic inches, which is equal

nience it is reckoned 11 min. 14 sec. more than this, or 365 da. 6h. = 365} da. This J
day in 4 years makes one day, which, every fourth, bissextile, or leap year, is added
to the shortest month, giving it 29 days. The leap years are exactly divisible by 4,
as 1356,1860,1861. The number of days in each calendar month may be easily re-
membered by committing the following lines:
.< Thirty days hath September,
April, Junet and November;
All the rest have thirty-one,
Save February, which alone
Hath twenty-eight; and one day more
We add to it one year in four."

Circular Measure.
207. Circular Measure, or Circular Motion, is used
principally in surveying, navigation, astronomy, and geogra-
phy, for reckoning latitude and longitude, determining loca-
tions of places and vessels, and computing difference of time.
Every circle, great or small, is divisible into the same num-
ber of equal parts, as quarters, called quadrants, twelfths,
called signs, 360ths, called degrees, etc. Consequently tt?,
parts of different circles, although having the same names,
are of different lengths.

If the days of the different months are not the same, the
number of days of difference should be added when the
earlier day belongs to the month from which we reckon, and
subtracted when it belongs to the month to which we find
the time. If the 29th of February is to be included in the
time computed, one day must be added to the result.

operation. Analysis. One acre will produce J
bu. pk. qt. pts. as much as 4 acres. Writing the divi-
4 ) 102 3 2 s°r on the left of the dividend, we di-
~ ~ ~ ~ vide 102 bu. by 4, and obtain a quotient
of 26 bu., and a remainder of 2 bu. We
write the 25 bu. under the denomination of bushels, and reduce the
2 bu. to pecks, making 8 pk., and the 3 pk. of the dividend added
makes 11 pk. Dividing 11 pk. by 4, we obtain a quotient of 2 pk.
and a remainder of 3 pk.; writing the 2 pk. under the order of pecks,
we next reduce 3 pk. to quarts, adding the 2 qt. of the dividend, mak-
ing 26 qt., which divided by 4 gives a quotient of 6 qt. and a remainder
of 2 qt. Writing the 6 qt. under the order of quarts, and reducing the
remainder, 2 qt., to pints, we have 4 pt., which divided by 4 gives a
quotient of 1 pt., which we write under the order of pints, and the
work is done.

equal parts, called degrees.
Since the sun appears to pass from east to west round the -
earth, or through 360°, once in every 24 hours, it will pass
through ^ of 360°, or 15° of the distance, in 1 hour; and
1° of distance in of 1 hour, or 4 minutes; and 1' of
distance in ^ of 4 minutes, or 4 seconds.

makes a difference of 4 minutes
1 h. 5 min. 48 sec., Ans. of time- and 1 of longitude a
we multiply 16° 27', the difference in longitude, by 4, and we obtain
the difference of time in minutes and seconds, which, reduced to higher
denominations, gives 1 h. 5 min. 48 sec, the difference in time.
Rule. Multiply the difference of longitude in degrees and
minutes by 4, and the product will be the difference of time in
minutes and seconds, which may be reduced to hours.
If one place be in east, and the other in west longitude, the difference of longitude
is found by adding them, and if the sum be greater than 180°, it mast be subtracted
from 360°.
Examples for Practice.
2. New York is 74° 1' and Cincinnati 84° 24' west longi-
tude ; what is the difference of time? Ans. 41 min. 32 sec.
3. The Cape of Good Hope is 18° 28' east, arid the Sand-
wich Islands 155° west longitude; what is the difference of
time? Ans. 11 h. 33 min. 52 sec.
4. Washington is 77° 1' west, and St. Petersburgh 30° 19'
east longitude; what is their difference of time?
5. If Pekin is 118° east, and San Francisco 122° west

6. If a message be sent by telegraph without any loss of
time, at 12 M. from London, 0° 0' longitude, to Washington,
77° 1' west, what is the time of its receipt at Washington?
Since the sun appears to move from east to west, when it is exactly 12 o'clock at
one place, it will be past 13 o'clock at all places east, and before 12 at all places west.
Hence, knowing the difference of time between two places, and the exact time at
one of them, the exact time at the other will be found by adding their duTeience to
the given time, if it be east, and by subtracting if it be wect.

DUODECIMALS.
221. Duodecimals are the divisions and subdivisions of
a unit, resulting from continually dividing by 12, as, jfa,
Y^-g! etc. In practice, duodecimals are applied to the meas-
urement of extension, the foot being taken as the unit
.
If the foot be divided into 12 equal parts, the parts are
called inches, or primes; the inches divided by 12 give sec-
onds; the seconds divided by 12 give thirds; the thirds
divided by 12 give fourths; and so on.
From these divisions of a foot it follows that
1' (Inch or Prime) is of a foot.
1" (Second) or ^ of ^ " of a foot.
1"' (Third) or ^ of ^ of ^ - -" of a foot-

Duodecimals are really common fractions, and can always bo treated as such; bat
usually their denominators are not expressed, and they are treated as compound
numbers.
Addition and Subtraction of Duodecimal

consider how many times
3 ft. and something more is contained in nearly 21 ft. (20 ft. 11'); we
estimate it to be 5 times, and multiplying the divisor by this quotient
figure, we have 18 ft. 9', which, subtracted from 20 ft. 11', leaves
2 ft. 2', to which we bring down 3", the last term of the dividend. We
next seek how many times the divisor is contained in this remainder,
and find by trial the quotient 7'; multiplying the divisor by this figure,
we obtain 2 ft. 2' 3", and there is no remainder.
Rule. I. Write the divisor on the left hand of the dividend,
as in simple numbers.
II. Find the first term of the quotient either by dividing
the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor,
or by dividing the first two terms of the dividend by the first

PERCENTAGE.
231. Per cent, is a term derived from the Latin words
per centum, and signifies by the hundred, or hundredths,
that is, a certain number of parts of each one hundred parts,
of whatever denomination. Thus, by 5 per cent. is meant 5
cents of every 100 cents, $5 of every $100, 5 bushels of every
100 bushels, etc. Therefore, 5 per cent. equals 5 hundredths
=.05=14ir=?1!r. 8 per cent. equals 8 hundredths=.08=
232. Percentage is such a part of a number as is indi-
cated by the per cent.
233. The Base of percentage is the number on which
the percentage is computed.
234. Since per cent. is any number of hundredths, it is
usually expressed in the form of a decimal; but it may be
expressed either as a decimal or a common fraction, as in

368 .92 — 400. 8 per cent, of his sheep, he has
92 per cent, left; hence 368 is .93
times his original flock. We therefore divide 368 by .92 and obtain
the required number of sheep.
Rule. Divide the given number by 1 minus the rate ex-

merchandise, after deducting his commission of 5 per cent.;
what is the sum invested, and how much is the commission?
OPERATION.
$1260 -f- 1.05 = $1200, invested.
$1260 — $1200 = $60, commission. ^
Or, m + tIt = I*; $1260 = $1200, invested;
And $1260 — $1200 = $60, commission.
Case II Li what? Give explanation. Rule.
215
Analysis. Since the commission is 5 per cent., the agent must
receive $ 1.05 for every $1 he expends; he can invest as many dollars
as $1.05 is contained times in $1260, which is $1200; and the differ-
ence between the given sum and the sum invested is his commission.
Or, the money expended is of itself, the commission is of
this sum, and the commission added to the sum expended is of
the whole sum. Since $1260 is = fj, $1260 •«- f£ = $1200, the
sum expended; and $1260 — $1200 = $60 the commission.
Rtjle. I. Divide the given amount by 1 increased by tht
rate per cent, of commission, and the quotient is the sum
invested.

PERCENTAGE.
264. Federal or United States Securities * are of two
kinds; viz., Bonds and Notes.
Bonds are of two kinds.
First, Those which are payable at a fixed date, and are
known and quoted in commercial transactions by the rate
of interest they bear, thus: U. S. 3's, that is, United Statee
Bonds bearing 3% interest.
Second, Those which are payable at a fixed date, b :1
which may be paid at an earlier specified time, as the Gov-
ernment may elect. These are known and quoted in com-
mercial transactions by a combination of the two dates,
thus: U. S. 5-20's; or a combination of the rate of inter-
est and the two dates, thus: IT. S. 6's 5-20; that is, bonds
bearing &% interest, which are payable in twenty years, but
may be paid in five years, if the Government so elect.
When it is necessary, in any transaction, to distinguish
from each other different issues which bear the same rate of
interest, this is done by adding the year in which they be-
come due, thus: U. S. 5's of '71; U. S. 5's of '74; TJ. S. 4's
of 1907, etc.
U. S. Notes are payable on demand, without interest, and
are known as United States Legal-tender Notes, or, in
common language, "Greenbacks."
The nomenclature here explained is that used in com-
mercial transactions, which involve similar Securities of
States or Corporations.
The interest on all U. S. bonds, except the Pacific R. R
6's, is payable in gold.
* Though many of the earlier classes of U. S. securities have been
refunded, a full statement of this subject is considered essential to an
understanding of the history of those securities which at present rep-
resent our public debt.
What are United States Securities composed of? Explain the dif-
ferent kinds of bonds. Of Notes. In what is the interest on each
payable?

GOLD INVESTMENTS.
26i). Currency is a term used ia commercial language,
First, To denote the aggregate of Specie and Bills of Exchange,
Bank Bills, Treasury Notes, and other substitutes for money employed
in buying, selling, atd carrying on exchange of commodities between
various nations.
Second, To denote whatever circulating medium is used in any
country as a substitute for the government standard.
In this latter sense, the paper circulating medium, when below pai
"a called Currency, to distinguish it from gold and silver. If, from
any cause, the paper medium depreciates in value, as it has done in
the United States, gold becomes an object of investment, the same as
stocks. In commercial language, gold is represented as rising and
falling; but gold being the standard of value, it cannot vary. The
variation is in the medium of circulation substituted for gold; hence,
when gold is said to be at a premium the currency, or circulating
medium is made the standard, while it is virtually below par.
Note. —The following examples may be omitted by those who pre-
fer to do so, since they have not the same practical value which they
had before the resumption of specie payments in 1879. A knowledge
of the subject of gold investments is necessary to the understanding
of some old accounts and a number of decisions of the U. S. Courts.
Case I.
270. To change gold into currency.

operation. Analysis. Since a dollar of gold
$1.70 x 150 = $255. is worth $1.70 in currency, there can
be as many times $1.70 of currency
bought as there are dollars of gold. Therefore, $1.70 x 150 = $255
S3 the amount of currency which can be purchased for $150 in gold.
Rule. Multiply the value of one dollar of gold in currency
Oy the num ber of dollars of gold.
2. What is the value in current funds of $250 gold, when
gold is 147$? • Ans. $367.50.

40 cents a pound; what per cent, was gained?
Case II is what? Give explanation. Rule.
OPERATION.
40 — 32 = 8; 8 32 = & = .25, Ans.
Or, 40 — 32 = 8; 8 -T- 32 = J x 100 = 25%.
Analysis. Since the gain on 32 cents is 40 — 32 = 8 cents, the
whole gain is T*y = \ of the purchase money ; and J reduced to a
decimal is 25 hundredths, equal to 25 per cent. Or, if the gain were
equal to the purchase money, it would be 100 per cent. ; but since the
gain is = \ of the purchase money, it will be*| of 100 per cent
equal to 25 per cent.
Rule. Make the difference between the purchase and selling
prices the numerator, and the purchase price the denomina-
tor; reduce to a decimal, and the result will be the per cent.
Or, Take such apart of 100 as the gain or loss is part of
the purchase price.

Or, $4.80 = $ of the cost; $4.80 -r-$ = $3.60.
Case IV is what V
PERCENTAGE.
Analysis. Since the gain is 33J per cent, of the cost, $1 of the
cost, increased by 83J- per cent., will be what $1 of cost gold for;
therefore there will be as many dollars of cost, as 1.33J is contained
times in $4.80, or $8.00. Or, since he gained 33J per cent. = -J- of the
cost, $4.80 is f of the cost; $4.80 J = $3.60.
If the rate per cent, be loss, subtract it from 1, instead of adding it.
Rule. Divide the selling price by 1 increased by the gain
or diminished by the loss per cent., expressed decimally, or in
the form of a common fraction, and the quotient will be the
cost.

284. When a tax is assessed on property, it is apportioned
at a certain per cent, on the estimated value.
When assessed on the person, it is apportioned equally
among the male citizens liable to assessment, and is called
a poll tax. Each person so assessed is called a poll.
What is a tax 1 How is a tax on property apportioned? On the
person, how?

285. Property is of two kinds—real estate, and per-
sonal property.
286. Real Estate consists of immovable property, such
as lands, houses, etc.
287. Personal Property consists of movable property,
su3h as money, notes, furniture, cattle, tools, etc.
288. An Inventory is a written list of articles of prop
erty, with their value.
289. Before taxes are assessed, a complete inventory of
all the taxable property upon which the tax is to be levied
must be made. If the assessment include a poll tax, then
a complete list of taxable polls must also be made out. -
I. A tax of $3165 is to be assessed on a certain town;
the valuation of the taxable property, as shown by the
assessment roll, is $600,000, and there are 220 polls to be
assessed 75 cents each; what will be the tax on a dollar, and
how much will bo A's tax, whose property is valued at $3750,
and who pays for 3 polls?
OPERATION.
$.75 x 230 = $103, amount assessed on the polls.
$3105 — $loj = $3000, amount to be assessed on the property.
$3000 $600,000 = .005, tax on $1.
$3750 x .00.5 = $18.75, A's tax on property.
$.75 x 3 = $2.25, A's tax on 3 polls.
$18.75+ $3.25 = $21, amount of A's tax.
Rule. I. Find the amount of poll tax, if any, and sub-
tract this sum from the whole amount of tax to be assessed.
II. Divide the sum to be raised on property, by the whole
amount of taxable property, and the quotient will be the per
cent., or the tax on one dollar.
III. Multiply each man's taxable property by the per cent.,
or the tax on $1, and to the product add his poll tax, if any j
the result will be the whole amount of his tax.
What is real estate? Personal property? An inventory? Explain
the process of levying a state or other tax. Rule.
PERCENTAGE.
Having found the tax on $1, or the per cent., which in the preceding example we
find to be 5 mills, or -g- per cent., the operation of assessing taxes may be greatly
facilitated by finding the tax on $2, $3, etc., to $10, and then on $90, $90, etc., to
$100, and arranging the numbers as in the following

CUSTOM-HOUSE BUSINESS.
290. Duties, or Customs, are taxes levied on imported
goods, for the support of government and the protection of
home industry.
291. A Custom-House is an office established by gov-
ernment for the transaction of business relating to duties.
292. A Port of Entry is a seaport town having a cus-
tom-house.

PERCENTAGE.
293. Tonnage is a tax levied upon a vessel, independent
of its cargo, for the privilege of coming into a port of entry.
294. Revenue is the income to government from duties
and tonnage.
Duties are of two kinds—ad valorem and specific.
295. Atl "Valorem Duty is a sum computed on the cost
of goods in the country from which they were imported.
296. SpeciGc Duty is a sum computed on the weight
or measure of goods, without regard to their cost.
297. An Invoice is a bill of goods imported, showing
the quantity and price of each kind.
298. By the New Tariff Act, approved March 2, 1857,
all duties taken at the U. S. custom-houses, are ad valorem.
In collecting customs, it is the design of government to
tax only so much of the merchandise as will be available to
the importer in the market. The goods are weighed, meas-
ured, gauged, or inspected, in order to ascertain the actual
quantity and value received in port; and an allowance i3
made in every case of waste, loss, or damage.
299. Tare is an allowance of the weight of the package
or covering that contains the goods. It is ascertained by
actually weighing one or more of the empty boxes, casks,
or coverings. In common articles of importation, it is
sometimes computed at a certain per cent. previously ascer-
tained by frequent trials.
300. Leakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
casks or barrels.
301. Breakage is an allowance on liquors imported in
bottles.
Actual leakage or breakage is allowed, there being no fixed or legal rate.
302. Gross Weight or Value is the weight or value of
the goods before any allowance has been made.

Case I.
311. To find the interest on any sum, at any rate
per cent., for years and months.
241
In percentage, any per cent. of any given number is so
many hundredths of that number; but in interest, any rate
per cent. is confined to 1 year, and the per cent. to be ob-
tained of any given number is greater than the rate per cent.
per annum if the time be more than 1 year, and less than the
rate per cent. per annum if the time be less than 1 year.
Thus, the interest on any sum, at any rate per cent., for 3
j jars 6 months, is 3^ times the interest on the same sum
for 1 year; and the interest for 3 months is \ of the interest
foi 1 year.

Contractions. After removing the separatrix in the principal, two
places to the left, the result may be regarded either aa the interest on
the given principal for 12 months at 1 per cent., or for 1 month at 12
per cent. If we regard it as for 1 month at 12 per cent., and if the
given rate be an aliquot part of 12 per cent., the interest on the given
principal for 1 month may readily be found by taking such an aliquot
part of the interest for 1 mouth as the given rate is part of 12 per
cent. Thus,
To find the interest for 1 month at 6 per cent., remove the separs
trix two places to the left, and divide by 2.
To find it at 3 per cent., proceed as before, and divide by 4; at 4 pet
cent., divide by 3; at 2 per cent., divide by 6, etc.
Sir Per Cent. Method.
313. By referring to 309 it will be seen that the legal
rate of interest in 21 States is 6 per cent. This is a sufficient
reason for introducing the following brief method into thia
work:
Analysis. At 6 per cent, per annum the interest on $1
For 12 months is $.00.
"2 months (Tss = J of 12 mo.) ".01.
"1 month, or 30 days (T'j of 12 mo.).." .00^ = $,006 of $.06).
"0 days (J of 30 days) ".001.
"1 " (J of 6 da. = ^ of 30 days).." .000J.
Hence we conclude that,
1st. The interest on $1 is $.005 per month, or $.01 for
every 2 months;
2d. The interest on $1 is $.000| per day, or $.001 for
every 6 days.
From these principles we deduce the
Rule. I. To find the rate :—Call every year $.06, every
2 months $.01, every 6 days $.001, and every less number of
days sixths of 1 mill.
II. To find the interest:—Multiply the principal by flu
rate.
1. To find the interest at any other rate per cent, by this method, first find it at
6 per cent., and then increase or diminish the result by as many times itBelf as the

method. Eule. Its application to any other rate per cent.
given rate id greater or less than 6 per cent. Thus, for 7 per cent, add J, for 4 per
cent, subtract ^, etc.
2. The interest of $10 for 6 days, or of $1 for 60 days, is $.01. Therefore, if the
principal be less than $10 and the time less than 6 days, or the principal less than
$1 and the time less than 60 days, the interest will be less than $.01, and may be
disregarded.
3. Since the interest of $1 for 60 days, is $.01, the interest of $1 for any number
of days is as many cents as 60 is contained times in the number of days. Therefore,
if any principal be multiplied by the number of days in any given number of months
and days, and the product divided by 60, the result will be the interest in cents.
That is, Multiply the principal by the number of days, divide the product by 60, and
point off two decimal places in the quotient. The result will be the interest in the
same denomination as the principal.

COMPOUND INTEREST.
324. Compound Interest is interest on both principal
and interest, when the interest is not paid when due.
The simple interest may be added to the principal annually, semi-annually, or
quarterly, as the parties may agree; but the taking of compound interest is not
legal.

325. Discount is an abatement or allowance made foi
the payment of a debt before it is duo.
326. The Present Worth of a debt, payable at a futuie
time without interest, is such a sum as, being put at legal in-
terest, will amount to the given debt when it becomes due.

328. A Promissory Note is a written or printed en-
gagement to pay a certain sum, either on demand or at a
specified time.
329. Bank Notes, or Bank Bills, are the notes made
and issued by banks to circulate as money. They are pay-
able in specie at the banks.
330. The Face of a note is the sum made payable by
the note.
331. Days of Grace are the three days usually allowed
by law for the payment of a note after the expiration of the
time specified in the note.
332. The Maturity of a note is the expiration of the
days of grace; a note is due at maturity.
333. Notes may contain a promise of interest, which will
be reckoned from the date of the note, unless some other
time be specified.
The transaction of borrowing money at banks is conducted
in accordance with the following custom: the borrower pre-
sents a note, either made or indorsed by himself, payable at
a specified time, and receives for it a sum equal to the face,
less the interest for the time the note has to run. The
amount thus withheld by the bank is in consideration of
advancing money on the note prior to its maturity.
334. Bank Discount is an allowance made to a bank
for the payment of a note before it becomes due.
335. The Proceeds of a note is the sum received for it
when discounted, and is equal to the face of the note less
the discount.

EXCHANGE.
338. Exchange is a method of remitting money from
one place to another, or of making payments by written
orders.
339. A Bill of Exchange is a written request or. order
upon one person to pay a certain sum to another person, or
to his order, at a specified time.
340. A Sight Draft or Bill is one requiring payment to
be made "at sight," which means, at the time of its presenta-
tion to the person ordered to pay. In other bills, the time
specified is usually a certain number of days "after sight."
There are always three parties, and usually four, to a
transaction in exchange.
341. The Drawer or Maker is the person who signs
the order or bill.
Give the rale. Define exchange. A hill of exchange, A sight
draft. Tlie drawer.
267
342. The Drawee is the person to -whom the order is
addressed.
343. The Payee is the person to whom the money is
ordered to be paid.
344. The Buyer or Remitter is the person who pur-
chases the bill. He may be himself the payee, or the bill
may be drawn in favor of any other person.
345. The Indorsement of a bill is the writing upon its
back, by which the payee relinquishes his title, and transfers
the payment to another. The payee may indorse in blank
by writing his name only, which makes the bill payable to
the bearer, and consequently transferable like a bank note;
or he may accompany his signature by a special order to pay
to another person, who in his turn may transfer the title in
like manner. Indorsers become separately responsible for
the amount of the bill, in case the drawee fails to make pay-
ment. A bill made payable to the bearer is transferable
without indorsement.
346. The Acceptance of a bill is the promise which the
drawee makes when the bill is presented to him to pay it at
maturity; this obligation is usually acknowledged by writ-
ing the word "Accepted," with his signature, across the
face of the bill.
Three days of grace are usually allowed for the payment of a bill of exchange
after the time specified has expired. But in New York State no grace is allowed on
sight drafts.
From these definitions, the use of a bill of exchange in
monetary transactions is readily perceived. If a man wishes
to make a remittance to a creditor, agent, or any other per-
son residing at a distance, instead of transporting specie,
which is attended with expense and risk, or sending bank
notes, which are liable to be uncurrent at a distance from
the banks that issue them, he remits a bill of exchange,
purchased at a bank or elsewhere, and made payable to tra

proper person in or near the place where he resides. Thus
a man by paying Boston funds in Boston, may put New
"York funds into the hands of his New York agent.
347. The Course of Exchange is the variation of the
cost of sight bills from their par value, as affected by the rela-
tive conditions of trade and commercial credit at the two
places between which exchange is made. It may be either at
& premium or discount, and is rated at a certain per cent. on
the face of the bill. Bills payable a specified time after sight
are subject to discount, like notes of hand, for the term of
credit given. Hence their value in the money market is
affected by both the course of exchange and the discount
for time.
348. Foreign Exchange relates to remittances made
between different countries.
349. Domestic or Inland Exchange relates to remit-
tances made between different places in the same country.
An inland bill of exchange is commonly called a Draft.
In this work we shall treat only of Inland Exchange.

received in Philadelphia, is accepted, and paid after the ex-
piration of the three days of grace. If the manufacturer
immediately puts this money at interest at the legal rate,
will he gain or lose by the blunder of his agent?
Ans. He will lose $1.90.
EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
352. Equation of Payments is the process of finding
the mean or equitable time of payment of several sums, due
at different times without interest.
353, The Term of Credit is the time to elapse before a
debt becomes due.
Rule. Define equation of payments. Term of credit.
EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
354. The Average Term of Credit is the time to elapse
before several debts, due at different times, may all be paid
at once, without loss to debtor or creditor.
355. The Equated Time is the date at which the sev-
eral debts may be canceled by one payment.
Case I.
356. "When all the terms of credit begin at the
same date.
1. On the first day of January I find that I owe Mr.
Smith 8 dollars, to be paid in 5 months, 10 dollars to be
paid in 2 months, and 12 dollars to be paid in 10 months;
at what time may I pay the whole amount?
OPERATION.

10 x 2 = 20
12 x 10 = 120
30 180 -5- 30 = 6 mo., average time cf credit.
Jan. 1+6 mo. = July 1, equated time of payment.
Analysis. The whole amount to be paid, as seen above, is $30;
and we are to find how long it shall be withheld, or what term of
credit it shall have, as an equivalent for the various terms of credit
on the different items. Now the value of credit on any sum is meas-
ured by the product of the money and time. And we say, the credit
on $8 for 5 mo. = the credit on $40 for 1 mo., because 8 x 5 = 40 x 1.
In the same manner, we have, the credit on $10 for 2 mo. = the credit
on $20 for 1 mo.; and the credit on $12 for 10 mo. = the credit on $120
for 1 mo. Hence, by addition, the value of the several terms of credit
on their respective sums equals a credit of 1 month on $180; and thk
equals a credit of 6 months on $30, because
30 x 6 = 180 x 1.
Rule. I. Multiply each payment by its term of credit,
and divide the sum of the products by the sum of the pay-
ments; the quotient ivill be the average term of credit.

II. Add the average term of credit to the date at which all
the credits begin, and the result will be the equated time of

1. The periods of time used as multipliers must all be of the same denomination,
and the quotient will be of the same denomination as the terms of credit; if these
be months, and there be a remainder after the division, continue the division to
days by reduction, always taking the nearest unit in the last result.
2. The several rules in equation of payments are based upon the principle of bank
discount; for they imply that the discount of a sum paid before it is due equals the
ixterest of the some amount paid after it is due.

359. The Items of an account may be sums due at the
date of the transaction, or on credit for a specified time.
An account may have both a debit and a credit side, the
former marked Dr., the latter Cr. Suppose A and B have
dealings in which there is an interchange of money or prop-
erty; A keeps the account, heading it with B's name; the
Dr. side of the account shows what B has received from A;
the Cr. side shows what he has parted with to A.
360. The Balance of account is the difference of the
two sides, and may be in favor of either party.
If, in the transactions, one party has received nothing from
the other, the balance is simply the whole amount, and the
account has but one side. Bills of purchase are of this class.
Book accounts bear interest after the expiration of the term of credit, and notes
after they become due.
361. To Average an Account is to find the mean or
equitable time of payment of the balance.

275
Analysis. By reference to the example, it will be seen that the
items are due June 1, Oct. 13, and Aug. 10, as shown in the two opera-
tions. In the first operation we use the earliest date, June 1, as a focal
date, and find the difference in days between this date and each of the
others, regard being had to the number of days in calendar months.
From June 1 to Oct. 12 is 133 da.; from June 1 to Aug. 16 is 76 da.
Hence the first item has no credit from June 1, the second item has
133 days' credit from June 1, and the third item has 76 days' credii
from June 1, as appears in the column marked da. After this we pro-
ceed precisely as in Case I, and find the average credit, 71 da., and
the equated time, Aug. 11.
In the second operation, the latest date, Oct. 13, is taken for a focal
date; the work is explained thus: Suppose the account to be settled
Oct. 12. At that time the first item has been due 133 days, and must
therefore draw interest for this time. But interest on g450 for 133
days = the interest on $59850 for 1 da. The second item draws no
interest, because it falls due Oct. 12. The third item must draw inter-
est 57 days. But interest on $250 for 57 days = the interest on $14250
for 1 day. Taking the sum of the products, we find the whole amount
of interest due on the account, at Oct. 12, equals the interest on $74100
for 1 day; and this, by division, is found to be equal to the interest on
$1200 for G2 days, which time is the average term of interest. Hence
the account would be settled Oct. 12, by paying $1200 with interest on
the same for 02 days. This shows that $1200 has been due 03 days;
that is, it falls due Aug. 11, without interest.
Rule. I. Find the time at which each item becomes due,
by adding to the date of each transaction the term of credit,
if any be specified, and write these dates in a column.
II. Assume either the earliest or the latest date for a focal
date, and find the difference in days between the focal date
and each of the other dates, and write the results in a second
column.
III. Write the items of the account in a third column, and
multiply each sum by the corresponding number of days in the
preceding column, writing the products in a final column.
IV. Divide the sum of the products by the sum of the items.
The quotient loill be the average term of credit when the

EQUATION OF PAYMENTS.
Analysis. In the above operation we have written the dates,
showing when the items become due on either side of the account,
adding 3 days' grace to the time allowed to the draft. The latest
date, Oct. 20, is assumed as the focal date for both sides, and the two
columns marked da. show the difference in days between each date
and the focal date. The products are obtained as in the last ease, and
a balance is struck between the items charged and the products.
These balances, being on the Dr. side, show that David Ware, on the
day of the focal date, Oct. 20, owes $600 with interest on $35450 for
1 day. By division, this interest is found to be equal to the interest
on $600 for 59 days. The balance, $600, therefore, has been due 59
days. Reckoning back from Oct. 20, we find the date when the bal-
ance fell due, Aug. 22.
Rule. I. Find the time when each item of the account is
due; and write the dates, in two columns, on the sides of the
account to which they respectively belong.
II. Use either the earliest or the latest of these dates as the
focal date for both sides, and find the products as in the last
case.
III. Divide the balance of the products by the balance of
the account; the quotient will be the interval of time, which
must be reckoned from the focal date toward the other dates
when both balances are on the same side of the account, but
from the other dates when the balances are on opposite sides
of the account.

RATIO.
364. Ratio is the comparison with each other of two
numbers of the same kind. It is of two kinds—arithmetical
and geometrical.
365. Arithmetical Ratio is the difference of the two
numbers.
366. Geometrical Ratio is the quotient of one num-
ber divided by the other.
367. When we use the word ratio alone, it implies geo-
metrical ratio, and is expressed by the quotient arising from
dividing one number by the other. Thus, the ratio of 4 to 8
is 2, of 10 to 5 is etc.
368. Ratio is indicated in two ways.
1st. By placing two points between the numbers com-
pared, writing the divisor before and the dividend after the
points. Thus, the ratio of 5 to 7 is written 5:7; the ratio
of 9 to 4 is written 9 : 4.
2d. In the form of a fraction; thus, the ratio of 9 to 3
is J; the ratio of 4 to 6 is J.
369. The Terms are the two numbers compared.
370. The Antecedent is the first term.
371. The Consequent is the second term.
372. No comparison of two numbers can be fully ex-
plained but by instituting another comparison; thus, the
It Is thought beet to omit the questions at the bottom of the pages la the remain-
ing part of this work, leaving the teacher to use such as may be deemed appropriatO.
comparison or relation of 4 to 8 cannot be fully expressed
by 2, nor of 8 to 4 by If the question were asked, what
relation 4 bears to 8, or 8 to 4, in respect .to magnitude, the
answer 2, or would not be complete nor correct. But if
we make unity the standard of comparison, and use it as
one of the terms in illustrating the relation of the two
numbers, and say that the ratio or relation of 4 to 8 is the
Bame as 1 to 2, or the ratio of 8 to 4 is the same as 1 to
unity in both cases being the standard of comparison, then
the whole meaning is conveyed.
373. A Direct Ratio arises from dividing the conse-
quent by the antecedent.
374. An Inverse or Reciprocal Ratio is obtained by
dividing the antecedent by the consequent. Thus, the direct
ratio of 5 to 15 is = 3; and the inverse ratio of 5 to 15
is A = h
375. A Simple Ratio consists of a single couplet; as
3 :12.
376. A Compound Ratio is the product of two or more
simple ratios. Thus, the compound ratio formed from the
simple ratios of 3 : 6 and 8:2is$x|=3x8:6x2 =
H = i
377. In comparing numbers with each other, they must
be of the same kind, and of the same denomination.
378. The ratio of two fractions is obtained by dividing
the second by the first; or by reducing them to a common
denominator, when they are to each other as their numera-
tors. Thus, the ratio oiI :$ is $ -f- ^ = = 2, which is
the same as the ratio of the numerator 3 to the numerator
6 of the equivalent fractions and -fo.
Since the antecedent is a divisor and the consequent a divi-
dend, any change in either or both terms will be governed by
the general principles of division, ( 87.) We have only to
substitute the terms antecedent, consequent, and ratio, for
divisor, dividend, and quotient, and these principles become
281
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RATIO.
Prin. I. Multiplying the consequent multiplies the ratio;
dividing the consequent divides the ratio.
Prin. II. Multiplying the antecedent divides the ratio;
dividing the antecedent multiplies the ratio.
Prin. III. Multiplying or dividing both antecedent and
consequent by the same number does not alter the ratio.
These *hree principles may be embraced in one
General Law.
A change in the consequent produces a like change in
the ratio; but a change in the antecedent produces an
opi osite change in the ratio.
379. Since the ratio of two numbers is equal to the con-
sequent divided by the antecedent, it follows, that
1. The antecedent is equal to the consequent divided by
the ratio; and that,
2. The consequent is equal to the antecedent multiplied
by the ratio.

PROPORTION.
380. Proportion is an equality of ratios. Thus, the
satios 6 : 4 and 12 :8, each "being equal to f, form a proportion.
381. Proportion is indicated in two ways:
1st. By a double colon placed between the two ratios;
thus, 2 :5 :: 4 :10.
2d. By the sign of equality placed between the two ratios;
Jhus, 2 :5 = 4:10.
382. Since each ratio consists of two terms, every pro-
portion must consist of at least four terms.
383. The Extremes are the first and fourth terms.
384. The Means are the second and third terms.
385. Three numbers may be in proportion when the first
is to the second as the second is to the third. Thus, the
numbers 3, 9, and 27 are in proportion since 3 : 9 :: 9:27,
the ratio of each couplet being 3.
In such a proportion the second term is said to be a mean
'proportional between the other two.
386. In every proportion the product of the extremes is
equal to the product of the means. Thus, in the proportion
3 : 5 :: 6 :10 we have 3 x 10 = 5 x 6.
283
387. Pour numbers that are proportional in the direct
order are proportional by inversion, and also by alternation,
or by inverting the means. Thus, the proportion 2:3::
6 : 9, by inversion becomes 3 : 2 :: 9 : 6, and by alterna-
tion 2 : 6 :: 3 : 9.
388. From the preceding principles and illustrations, it
follows that, any three terms of a proportion being given-
the fourth may readily be found by the following
Rule. I. Divide the product of the extremes by one of the
means, and the quotient will be the other mean. Or,
II. Divide the product of the means by one of the extremes,
and the quotient will be the other extreme.

SIMPLE PROPORTION.
389. Simple Proportion is an equality of two simplt-
ratios, and consists of four terms, any three of which being
given, the fourth may readily bo found.
390. Every question in simple proportion involves the
principle of cause and effect.
391. Causes may be regarded as action, of whatever
kind, the producer, the consumer, men, animals, time, dis-
tance, weight, goods bought or sold, money at interest, etc.
PROPOKTIOK.
392. Effects may be regarded as whatever is accom-
plished by action of any kind, the thing produced or con-
sumed, money paid, etc.
393. Causes and effects are of two kinds—simple and
compound.
394. A Simple Cause, or Effect, contains but one ele-
ment; aa goods purchased or sold, and the money paid or
received for them.
395. A Compound Cause, or Effect, is the product ot
two or more elements; as men at work taken in connection
with time, and the result produced by them taken in con-
nection with dimensions, length and breadth, etc.
396. Causes and effects that admit of computation, that
is, involve the idea of quantity, may be represented by num-
bers, which will have the same relation to each other as the
things they represent. And since it is a principle of philoso-
phy that like causes produce like effects, and that effects are
always in proportion to their causes, we have the following
proportions:
1st Cause : 2d Cause :: 1st Effect : 2d Effect.
Or, 1st Effect : 2d Effect :: 1st Cause : 2d Cause;
in which the two causes, or the two effects forming one coup-
let, must be like numbers, and of the same denomination.
Considering all the terms of the proportion as abstract
numbers, we may say that
1st Cause : 1st Effect :: 2d Caused. 2d Effect;
which will produce the same numerical result.
But as ratio is the result of comparing two numbers oi
things of the same kind (377), the first form is regarded
as the most natural and philosophical.
397. Simple causes and simple effects give Tise to simple
ratios ; compound causes and compound effects to compound
ratios.

Rule. I. Arrange the terms in the statement so that the
causes shall compose one couplet, and the effects the other, put-
ting ( ) in the place of the required term.
II. If the required term be an extreme, divide the product
of the means by the given extreme; if the required term be a
mean, divide the product of the extremes by the given mean.
1. If the terms of any couplet be of different denominations, theymust be reduced
to the same unit value.
2. If the odd term be a compound number, it must be reduced to its lowest unit.
3. If the divisor and dividend contain one or more factors common to both, they
should be canceled. If any of the terms of a proportion contain mixed numbers,
they should first be changed to improper fractions, or the fractional part to a decimal.
4. When the vertical line is used, the divisor and the required term are written on
the left, amd the terms of the dividend on the right.
PROPORTION.
399. We will now give another method of solving ques-
tions in simple proportion, without making the statement,
and which may be used, by those who prefer it, to the one
already given. We will term it the
Second Method.
Every question which properly belongs to simple propor-
tion must contain four numbers, at least three of which
must be given (389). Of the three given numbers, one
must always be of the same denomination as the required
number. The remaining two will be like numbers, and
bear the same relation to each other that the third does to
the required number; in other words, the ratio of the third
to the required number will be the same as the ratio of the
other two numbers.
Regarding the third or odd term as the antecedent of the
second couplet of a proportion, we find the consequent or re-
quired term by multiplying the antecedent by the ratio (379).
By comparing the two like numbers, in any given ques-
tion, with the third, we may readily determine whether the
answer, or required term, will be greater or less than the
third term; if greater, then the ratio will be greater than
1, and the two like numbers may be arranged in the form
of an improper fraction as a multiplier; if the answer, or
required term, is to be less than the third term, then the

arranged in the form of a proper fraction, as a multiplier.

and 20 cords are the
like terms, and that $12 is the third term, and of the same denomina-
tion as the answer or required term.
If 4 cords cost $12, will 20 cords cost more, or less, than 4 cords?
evidently more: then the answer or required term will be greater
287
than the third term, and the ratio greater than 1. The ratio of 4
cords to 20 cords is *40-, or 5; hence the ratio of £12 to the answer
must be 5, and the answer will be or 5 times $12, which is $60.

term, and of the same denomination as the required answer.
If 12 yards cost $48, will 4 yards cost more or less than 12 yards?
less: then the ratio will be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper
fraction. The ratio of 12 yards to 4 yards is T%; hence the ratio of $ 18

COMPOUND PROPORTION.
400. Compound Proportion embraces that class of
questions in which the causes, or the effects, or both, are
compound.
The required term may be a cause, or a single element of a
cause; or it may be an effect, or a single element of an effect.

Analysis. In
this example the
required term is
the length of the
ditch, and is an element of the
second effect. The question,
as stated, will read thus: if 7
men, in 12 days, dig n ditch GO
feet long, 8 feet wide, and G
feet deep, 21 men, in 2J days,
will dig a ditch how many, or
(hlank) feet long, 3 feet wide,
and 8 feet deep?
Rule. I. Of the given terms, select those which constitute
the causes, and those which constitute the effects, and arrange
them in couplets, putting ( ) in place of the required term.
291
II. Tlien, if the blank term ( ) occur in cither of the ex-
tremes, make the product of the means a dividend, and the
product of the extremes a divisor; but if the blank term occur
in either mean, make the product of the extremes a dividend,
and the product of the means a divisor.
1. The causes must bo exactly alike in the number and kind of their terms; the
same is true of the effects.
2. The same preparation of the terms by reduction is to be observed as in simple
proportion.
401. We will now solve an example according to the
Second Method given in Simple Proportion.
1. If 18 men can build 42 rods of wall in 16 days, how
many men can build 28 rods in 8 days?
Since compound proportion is made up of two or more simple pro-
portions, if this third or odd term be multiplied by the compound ratio,
or by the simple ratio of each couplet successively, the product will
be the required term.
By comparing the terms of each couplet with the third term we may
readily determine whether the answer, or term sought, will be greater
or less than the third term; if greater, then the ratio will be greater
than 1, and the multiplier an improper fraction; if less, the ratio will
be less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction.
First we will compare the terms composing the first couplet, 43
rods and 28 rods, with the third term, 18 men. If 42 rods require
18 men, how many men will 28 rods require? less men ; hence the
ratio is less than 1, and the multiplier a proper fraction, |f; next, if
10 days require 18 men, how many men will 8 days require? more
men; hence the ratio is greater than 1, and the multiplier an improper
fraction, Y". Regarding the third term as the antecedent of a couplet,
the consequent being the term sought, if we multiply this third term
by the simple ratios, or by their product, we shall have the required
term or answer, thus: 18 x J J x Jgt = 24, as shown in the operation.

BY CANCELLATION. Analysis. The required term or nn-
swer is to be in days; and we see that
all the terms appear in pairs or couplets,
except the 16 days, which is of the same
kind as the answer sought.
We will proceed to compare the terms
of each couplet with the 16 days. First,
if 5 compositors require 16 days, how
many days will 10 compositors require?
less days; hence the multiplier is the

Next, if 14 hours a day require 16 days,
how many days will 7 hours a day require? more days; hence the,
multiplier is the improper fraction \4, and we have 16 x Ts5 x
Next, if 20 sheets require 16 days, how many days will 40 sheets re-
quire 1 more days; hence the multiplier is the improper fraction \%,
and we have 16 x-fa x\4x f g. Pursuing tho same method with the
other couplets, we obtain the result as shown in the operation.
Rule. I. Of the terms composing each couplet form a
ratio greater or less than 1, in the same manner as if the
answer depended on those two and the third or odd term.
II. Multiply the third or odd term by these ratios succes-
sively, and the product will be the answer sought.
By the odd term is meant the one that is of the same kind as the answer.
The following examples may bo solved by either of the
given methods:

PARTNERSHIP.
402. Partnership is a relation established between two
or more persons in trade, by which they agree to share the
profits and losses of business.
403. The Partners are the individuals thus associated.
404. Capital, or Stock, is the money or property in-
vested in trade.
405. A Dividend is the profit to be divided.
406. An Assessment is a tax to meet losses sustained.

207. To find each partner's share of the profit or
loss, when their capital is employed for equal pe-
riods of time.

TFc may also regard the whole capital as the first cause,
and each man's share of the capital as the second cause, the
whole profit or loss as the first effect, and each man's share
of the profit or loss as the second effect, and solve by propor-

Case II.
408. To find each partner's share of the profit
or loss when their capital is employed for unequal
periods of time.
It is evident that the respective shares of profit and loss
will depend upon two conditions, viz.: the amount of capital
invested by each, and the time it is employed.

the loss, $156, be divided between the two partners, according to
Case I, the results will be the loss of each as shown in the operation.

Rule. Multiply each man's capital by the time it is em-
ployed in trade, and add the products. Then multiply the
entire profit or loss by the ratio of the sum of the products to
each product, and the results will be the respective shares of
profit or loss of each partner. Or,
Multiply each man's capital by the time it is employed in
trade, and regard each product as his capital, and the sum
of the products as the entire capital, and solve by proportion,
as in Case I.

ANALYSIS.
409. Analysis, in arithmetic, is the process of solving
problems independently of set rules, by tracing the relations
of the given numbers and the reasons of the separate steps
of the operation according to the special conditions of each
question.
410. In solving questions by analysis, we generally reason
from the given number to unity, or 1, and then from unity,
or 1, to the required number.
411. United States money is reckoned in dollars, dimes,
cents, and mills (180), one dollar being uniformly valued
in all the States at 100 cents.
At the time of the adoption of our decimal currency by Congress, in 1780, the
colonial currency, or bills of credit, issued by the colonies, had depreciated in value;
and this depreciation, being unequal in the different colonies, gave rise to the dif-
ferent values of the State currencies.
In many of the States it was customary to give the retail price of articles in shil-
lings and pence, and the cost of the whole in dollars and cents.

This usage has become nearly if not quite obsolete all over the country; but as
the matter has an historical interest, it is retained in this new edition, to avoid
derangement with previous editions, and the examples will also afford a pleasant

days can 24 men build a wall 200 ft. long, 8 ft. high, and G ft.
thick, working 8 hours a day?
OPERATION.
Analysis. Since 8 men require 12 days of 10 hours each to build
the wall, 1 man would require 8 times 12 days of 10 hours each, and
10 times (12 x 8) days of 1 hour each. To build a wall 1 ft. long would
require ^ as much time as to build a wall 20 ft. long; to build a wall
1 ft. high would require J- as much time as to build a wall 6 ft. high;
to build a wall 1 ft. thick, J as much time as to build a wall 4 ft. thick.
Now, 24 men could build this wall in ^ as many days, by working
1 hour a day, as 1 man could build it, and in J as many days by work-
ing 8 hours a day, as by working 1 hour a day; but to build a wall
200 ft. long would require 200 times as many days a3 to build a wall

Subtracting this from 12 bushels of wheat and 5 bushels of corn,
w'.rich cost $20, we find the cost of 10 bushels of wheat to be $14;
therefore the cost of 1 bushel is ^ of $14, or $1.40. From any one oi

ALLIGATION.
413.' Alligation treats of mixing or compounding two
or more ingredients of different values. It is of two kinds—
Alligation Medial and Alligation Alternate.
414. Alligation Medial is the process of finding the
average price or quality of a compound of several simp!:
ingredients whose prices or qualities are known.
1. A miller mixes 40 bushels of rye worth 80 cents a
bushel, and 25 bushels of corn worth 70 cents a bushel, with
15 bushels of wheat worth $1.50 a bushel; what is the value
of a bushel of the mixture?
operation. Analysis. Sinco 40 bushels
80 x 40 = $32.00 of rye at 80 cents a bushel is
70 x 25 = 17 50 worth $32, and 25 bushels of corn
at 70 cents a bushel is worth
$17.50, and 15 bushels of wheat
1.50 x 15 = 22.50
80 ) 72.00 at $1.50 a bushel is worth $22.60,
$90 Ans therefore the entire mixture, con-
'sisting of 80 bushels, is worth
$72, and one bushel is worth Vu of $72, or 72 80 = $.90.
Rule. Divide the entire cost or value of the ingredients
by the sum of the simples.
Examples for Practice.
2. A wine merchant mixes 12 gallons of wine, at $1 per
gallon, with 5 gallons of brandy worth $1.50 per gallon, and
3 gallons of water of no value; what is the worth of one
gallon of the mixture? Ans. $.975.
3. An innkeeper mixed 13 gallons of water with 52 gallons
of brandy, which cost him $1.25 per gallon; what is the value
of 1 gallon of the mixture, and what his profit on the sale of
tho whole at 6\ cents per gill? Ans. $1 a gallon ; $65 profit.
4. A grocer mixed 10 pounds of sugar at 8 cts. with 12
pounds at 9 cts. and 16 pounds at 11 cts., and sold the mix-
ture at 10 cents per pound; did he gain or lose by the sale,
and how much? Ans. He gained 16 cts.
ALLIGATION ALTERNATE.
5. A grocer bought 7£ dozen of eggs at 12 cents a dozen,
8 dozen at 10£ cents a dozen, 9 dozen at 11 cents a dozen,
and 10£ dozen at 10 cents a dozen. He sells them so as to
make 50 per cent. on the cost; how much did ho receive
per dozen? Ans. 16-J cents.
6. Bought 4 cheeses, each weighing 50 pounds, at 13 cents
a pound; 10, weighing 40 pounds each, at 10 cents a pound .•
and 24, weighing 25 pounds each, at 7 cents a pound; I
sold the whole at an average price of 9£ cents a pound;
what was my whole gain? . Ans. $6.
415. Alligation Alternate is the process of finding the
proportional quantities to be taken of several ingredients,
whose prices or qualities are known, to form a mixture of a
required price or quality.
Case I
.
416. To find the proportional quantity to be used
of each ingredient, when the mean price or quality
of the mixture is given.
1. What relative quantities of timothy seed worth $2 a
bushel, and clover seed worth $7 a bushel, must bo used to
form a mixture worth $5 a bushel?
operation. Analysis. Since on every ingre-
l 2 | \ 2 ) dient used whose price or quality
5 I ij/ j ^ g j Ans. is less than the mean rate there will
be a gain, and on every ingredient
whose price or quality is greater than the mean rate there will be a
loss, and since the gains and losses must be exactly equal, the relative
quantities used of each should be such as represent the unit of value.
By selling one bushel of timothy seed worth $2, for $5, there is a gain
of $3; and to gain $1 would require J of a bushel, which we place
opposite the 2. By selling one busbel of clover seed worth $7, for $5,
there is a loss of $2; and to lose $1 would require J of a bushel, which
we place opposite the 7.
In every case, to find the unit of value we must divide $1 by tho
gain or loss per bushel or pound, etc. Hence, if, every time we take
$ of a bushel of timothy seed, we take J of a bushel of clover seed,
the gain and loss will bs exactly equal, and wo shall havo J and £ for
the proportional quantities.

If we wish to express the proportional numbers in integers, wo
may reduce these fractions to a common denominator, and use their
numerators, eince fractions having a common denominator are to each
other as their numerators. (378) thus, J and ^ are equal to § and f,
and the proportional quantities are 2 bushels of timothy seed to 3
bushels of clover seed.
2. What proportions of teas worth respectively 3, 4, 7 and
10 shillings a pound, must be taken to form a mixture worth
6 shillings a pound?
operation. Analysis. To preserve the
equality of gains and losses, wo
must always compare two prices
or simples, one greater and one
less than the mean rate, and
treat each pair or couplet as a
separate example. In the given
example we form two couplets,
and may compare either 3 and 10, 4 and 7, or 3 and 7, 4 and 10.
Wo find that J of a lb. at 3s. must be taken to gain 1 shilling, and
J of a lb. at 10s. to lose 1 shilling; also, { of a lb. at 4s. to gain 1 shil-
ling, and 1 lb. at 7s. to lose 1 shilling. These proportional numbers,
obtained by comparing the two couplets, are placed in columns 1 and 2.
If, now, we reduce the numbers in columns 1 and 2 to a common de-
nominator, and use their numerators, we obtain the integral numbers
in columns 3 and 4, which being arranged in column 5, give the pro-
portional quantities to be taken of each.*
It will be seen that in comparing the simples of any couplet, one of
which is greater, and the other less than the mean rate, the propor-
tional number finally obtained for either term is the difference between
the mean rate and the other term. Thus, in comparing 3 and 10, the
proportional number of the former is 4, which is the difference between
10 and the mean rate 0; and the proportional number of the latter is 3,
which is the difference between 3 and the mean rate. The same is
true of every other couplet. Hence, when the simples and the mean
rate are integers, the intermediate steps taken to obtain the final pro-
portional numbers as in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4, may be omitted, and
the same results readily found by taking the difference between each
simple and the mean rate, and placing it opposite the one with which
it is compared.
* Prof. A. B. Canfleld, of Oneida Conference Seminary, N. Y., used this method of
Alligation, essentially, in the instruction cf his classes as early as 1846, and he was
doubtless the author cf it.
ALLIGATION ALTERNATE.
Rule. I. Write the several prices or qualities in a column,
and the mean price or quality of the mixture at the left.
II. Form couplets by comparing any price or quality less,
with one that is greater than the mean rate, placing the part
which must be used to gain 1 of the mean rate opposite the less
simple, and the part that must be used to lose 1 opposite the
greater simple, and do the same for each simple in every
couplet.
III. If the proportional numbers are fractional, they may
be reduced to integers, and if two or more stand in the same
horizontal line, they must be added j the final results will be
the proportional quantities required.
1. If the numbers in any couplet or column have a comtDDn factor; it may be
rejected.
2. We may also multiply the numbers in any couplet or column by any multiplici
we choose, without affecting the equality of the gains and losses, and thus obtain
an indefinite number of lesults, any cnc of which being taken w.!l give a correct
final result.
Examples for Practice.

419. A Power is the product arising from multiplying
a number by itself, or repeating it several times as a factor;
thus, in 2 x 2 x 2 = 8, the product, 8, is a power of 2.
420. The Exponent of a power is the number denoting
how many times the factor is repeated to produce the power,
and is written above and a little to the right of the factor;
thus, 2 x 2 x 2 is written 23, in which 3 is the exponent.
Exponents likewise give names to the powers, as will b<
socn in the following illustrations:
3 = 31 = 3, the first power of 3;

equal factors that produce the number; thus the square
root of 49 is 7, for 7 x 7 = 49.

If we point off a number into two-figure periods, commen-

places in the square root; the highest period answering to
the highest figure of the root.
4,34. 1. What is the length of one side of a square plat
containing an area of 5417 sq. ft.
operation. Analysis. Since the given figure is
54,17 | 73.6 a square, its side will be the square root
of its area, which we will proceed to com-
pute. Pointing off the given number, the
2 periods show that there will be two in-
tegral figures, tens and' units, in the root.
The tens of the root must be extracted
from the first or left hand period, 54 hun-
dreds. The greatest square in 54 hun-
dreds is 49 hundreds, the square of 7 tens;
we therefore write 7 tens in the root, at
the right of the given number.
Since the entire root is to be the side of a square, let us form a
square (Fig. I), the side of which is 70 feet long.
The area of this square is 70 x 70 = 4900 sq. ft,
which we subtract from the given number. This
is done in the operation by subtracting the
square number, 49, from the first period, 54,
and to the remainder bringing down the second
period, making the entire remainder 517.
If we now enlarge our square (Pig. I) by the addition of 517 square
feet, in such a manner as to preserve the square form, its size will be
that of the required square. To preserve the square form, the addition
must be so made as to extend the square equally in two directions;
it will therefore be composed of 2 oblong figures at the sides, and a
little square at the corner (Fig. II). Now, the width of this addition
will be the additional length to the side of the square, and conse-
quently the next figure in the rout. To find icidth we divide square
contents, or area, by length. But the length of one side of the little
square cannot be found till the width of the addition be determined,
because it is equal to this width. We will therefore add the lengths
of the 2 oblong figures, and the sum will be sufficiently near the
whole length to be used as a trial divisor.

Trial Divisor = 140.
: Complete Divisor = 143.
Each of the oblong figures is equal in length to the side of the
square first formed; and their united length
is 70 + 70 = 140 ft. (Fig. III). This num-
ber is obtained in the operation by doubling
the 7 and annexing 1 cipher, the result being
written at the left of the dividend. Dividing
517, the area, by 140, the approximate length,
we obtain 3, the probable width of the addi-
tion, and second figure of the root. Since 3 is
also the side of the little square, we can now
find the entire length of the addition, or the complete divisor, which
is 70 + 70 + 3 = 143 (Fig. III).
1 his number is found in the oper-
ation by adding 3 to the trial
divisor, and writing the result un-
derneath. Multiplying the com-
plete divisor, 143. by the trial
quotient figure, 3, and subtracting
the product from the dividend, we
obtain another remainder of 88 square feet. With this remainder,
for the same reason as before, we must proceed to make a new
enlargement; and we bring down two decimal ciphers, because the
next figure of the root, being tenths, its square will be hundredths.
The trial divisor to obtain the width of this new enlargement, or the
next figure in the root, will be, for the same reason as before, twico
73, the root already found, with one cipher annexed. But since the
7 has already been doubled in the operation, we have only to double
the last figure of the complete divisor, 143, and annex a cipher, to
obtain the new trial divisor, 146.0. Dividing, we obtain .6 for the
trial figure of the root; then proceeding as before, we obtain 146.6
for a complete divisor, 87.96 for a product; and there is still a re-
mainder of .04. Hence, the side of the given square plat is 73.6 feet,
nearly. From this example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Point off the given number into periods of two
figures each, counting from unit's place toward the left and
right.

IV. Add the trial figure of the root to the trial divisor for
a complete divisor; multiply the complete divisor by the trial

V. To the last complete divisor add the last figure of the
root, and to the sum annex one cipher, for a new trial divisor,
with which proceed as before.
1. If at anytime the product be greater than the dividend, diminish the trial figure
of the root, and correct the erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex another cipher to the trial divisor, and

CUBE ROOT.
442. The Cube Root of a number is one of the three
equal factors that produce the number. Thus, the cube
root of 27 is 3, since 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.
443. In extracting the cube root, the first thing to be
determined is the relative number of places in a cube and
its root. The law governing this relation is exhibited u
the following examples:
Hoots. Cubes. Roots. Cubes.

99 . 907,299 100 1,000,000
999 997,002,999 1000 1,000,000,000
From these examples, wo perceive,
1st. That a root consisting of 1 place may have from 1 to
3 places in the cube.
2d. That in all cases the addition of 1 place to the root
adds three places to the cube.
If we point off a number into three-figure periods, com-
mencing at the right hand, the number of full periods and
the left hand full or partial period will indicate the number
of places in the cube root, the highest period answering to the
highest figure of the root.
444. 1. What is the length of one side of a cubical
Hock containing 413494 solid inches?
operation—commenced. Analtsis. Since the block is a
413494 | 74 cube, its side will be the cube root
of its solid contents, which we will
proceed to compute. Pointing off
14700 70494 tke gjven number, the two periods
show that there will be two figures,
tens and units, in the root. The tens of the root must be extracted
from the first period, 413 thousands. The greatest cube in 413 thou-
sands is 343 thousands, the cube of 7 tens; we therefore write 7 tens
in the root at the right of the given number.
333
Since the entire root is to be the side of a cube, let us form a
cubical block (Fig. I), the side
of which is 70 inches in length.
The contents of this cube are
70 x 70 x 70 = 343,000 solid
inches, which we subtract from
the given number. This is done
in the operation by subtracting
the cube number, 343, from the
first period, 413, and to the re-
mainder bringing down the sec-
ond period, making the entire
remainder 70494.
If we now enlarge our cubical
block, (Fig. I), by the addition of 70494 solid inches, in such a man-
ner as to preserve the cubical form, its size will be that of the required
block. To preserve the cubical form, the addition must be made upon
three adjacent sides or faces. The addition will therefore be com-
posed of 3 flat blocks to cover the 3 faces, (Fig. II,; 3 oblong blocks
to fill the vacancies at the edges, (Fig. Ill); and 1 small cubical block
to fill the vacancy at the corner, (Fig. IV.) Now, the thickness of this
enlargement will be the addititmal length of the side of the cube,
and, consequently, the second figure in the root. To find thickness,
we may divide solid contents by surface, or area. But the area of
the 3 oblong blocks and lit-
tle cube cannot be found
till the thickness of the ad-
dition be determined, be-
cause their common breadth
is equal to this thickness.
We will therefore find the
area of the three fiat blocks,
which is sufficiently near
the whole area to be used
as a trial divisor. As these
are each equal in length and
breadth to the side of tho
cube whose faces they cover,
the whole area of the three
is 70 x 70 x 3 = 14700 square inches. This number is obtained in the
operation by annexing 2 ciphers to three times the square of 7; the re-
sult being written at the left hand of the dividend. Dividing, we obtain

ment, or the next figure of the root,
blocks to cover the three sides of tl
ldition, and second figure of the
root. \Y ith this assumed figure,
we will complete our divisor by
adding the area of the 4 blocks,
before undetermined. The 3 ob-
long blocks are each 70 inches
long; and the little cube, being
equal in each of its dimensions
io the thickness of the addition
must be 4 inches long. Her.^e,
their united length is 7C- + 70
+ 70 + 4 = 214. This number -
is obtained in the operation by
multiplying the 7 by 3, and an-
nexing the 4 to the product, the
result being written in column
I, on the next line below the
trial divisor. Multiplying 214,
the length, by 4, the common
width, we obtain 836, the area of
the four blocks, which added to
14700, the trial divisor, makes
15556, the complete divisor; and
multiplying this by 4, the second
figure in the root, and subtract-
ing the product from the divi-
dend, we obtain a remainder of
8270 solid inches. With this re-
mainder, for the same reason as
before, we must proceed to make
a new enlargement. But since
we have already two figures in
the root, answering to the two
periods of the given number,
the next figure of the root must
be a decimal; and we therefore
annex to the remainder a period
of three decimal ciphers, mpk-
ing 8270.000 for a new dividend.
The trial divisor to obtain the
thickness of this second enlarge-
will be the area of three new flat
e cube already formed; and this

surface, (Fig. IV,) ia composed of 1 face of each of the flat Mocks
already used, 2 faces of each of the oblong blocks, and 3 faces of
the little cube. But we have in the complete divisor, 15556, 1 face
of each of the flat blocks, oblong blocks, and little cube; and in the
correction of the trial divisor, 85G, 1 face of each of the oblong blocks
and of the little cube; and in the square of the last root figure, 16, a
third face of the little cube. Hence, 16 + 856 + 15556 = 16428, the
significant figures of the new trial divisor. This number is obtained
in the opera
tion by adding
the square of
the last root
figure mental-
ly, and com-
bining units
of like order,
thus: 16, 6,
and 6 are 28,
and we write
the unit figure in the new trial divisor; then 2 to carry, and 5 and 5
are 12, etc. We annex 2 ciphers to this trial divisor, as to the former,
and dividing, obtain 5, the third figure in the root. To complete tho
second trial divisor, after the manner of the first, the correction may
be found by annexing .5 to 3 times the former figures, 74, and multi-
plying this number by .5. But as we have, in column I, 3 times 7,
with 4 annexed, or 214, we need only multiply tho last figure, 4, by 3, and
annex .5, making 222.5, which multiplied by .5 gives 111 25, the correc-
tion required. Then we obtain the complete divisor, 16539.25, the pro-
duct, 8269.625, and the remainder, .375, in the manner shown by the for-
mer steps. From this example and analysis we deduce the following
Rule. I. Point off the given number into periods of throe
figures each, counting from units' place toward the left and
right.
II. Find the greatest cube that does not exceed the left hand
period, and write its root for the first figure in the required
root; subtract the cube from the left hand period, and to the
remainder bring down the next period for a dividend.
III. At the left of the dividend write three times the square
of the first figure of the root, and annex two ciphers, for a trial
divisor; divide the dividend by the trial divisor, and write
the quotient for a trial figure in the root.
EVOLUTION.
IV. Annex the trial figure to three times the former figure,
and write the result in a column marked I, one line below the
trial divisor; multiply this term by the trial figure, and write
the product on the same line in a column marked II; add
this term as a correction to the trial divisor, and the result
will be the complete divisor.
V. Multiply the complete divisor by the trial figure, and
subtract the product from the dividend, and to the remainder
bring down the next period for a new dividend.
VI. Add the square of the last figure of the root, the last
term in column II, and the complete divisor together, and an-
nex two ciphers, for a new trial divisor; with which obtain
another trial figure in the root.
VII. Multiply the unit figure of the last term in column I
by o, and annex the trial figure of the root for the next term
of column I; multiply this result by the trial figure of the root
for the next term of column II; add this term to the trial
divisor for a complete divisor, with which proceed as before.
1. If at any time the product be greater than the dividend, diminish the trial
figure of the root, and correct thu erroneous work.
2. If a cipher occur in the root, annex two more ciphers to the trial divisor, and
another period to the dividend; then proceed as before with column I, annexing
both cipher and trial figure.

ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION,
445. An Arithmetical Progression, or Series, is a
series of numbers increasing or'decreasing by a common dif-
ference. Thus, 3, 5, 7, 9,11, etc., is an arithmetical pro-
gression with an ascending series, and 13,10, 7, 4, etc., is an
arithmetical progression with a descending series.
446. The Terms of a series are the numbers of which
it is composed.
447. The Extremes are the first and last terms.
448. The Means are the intermediate terms.
449. The Common Difference is the difference between
any two adjacent terms.
450. There are five parts in an arithmetical series, any
three of which being given, the other tioo may be found.
They are as follows: the first term, last term, common dif-
ference, number of terms, and sum of all the terms.
Case L
451. To find the last term when the first term,
common difference, and number of terms are given
Let 2 be the first term of an ascending series, and 3 the
common difference; then the series will be written, 2, 5, 8,
11,14, or analyzed thus: 2, 2 + 3,2 + 3+3, 2 + 3+ 3 +
3, 2 + 3 + 3+ 3 + 3.
Here we see that, in an ascending series, we obtain the
second term by adding the common difference once to the first
term; the third term, by adding the common difference
twice to the first term; and, in general, we obtain any term
329
by adding the common difference as many times to the first
term as there are terms less one.
The analysis for a descending series would be similar.
Rule. Multiply the common difference by the number of
terms less one, and add the product to the first term, if the
series be ascending, and subtract it if the series be descending.
Examples for Practice.
1. The first term of an ascending series is 4, the common
difference 3, and the number of terms 19; what is the last
term? Ans. 58.
2. What is the 13th term of a descending series whose
first term is 75, and common difference 5? Ans. 15.
3. A boy bought 18 hens, paying 2 cents for the first, 5
cents for the second, and 8 cents for the third, in arith-
metical progression; what did he pay for the last hen?
4. What is the 40th term of the series \, f, 1, 1\, etc.?
Ans. 10£.
5. A man travels 9 days; the first day he goes 20 miles,
the second 25 miles, increasing 5 miles each day; how far
does he travel the last day of his journey? Ans. 60 miles.
6. What is the amount of $100, at 7 per cent., for 45
years? $100 + $7 x 45 = $415, Ans.
Case II.
452. To find the common difference when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
Referring to the series, 2, 5, 8, 11,14, analyzed in 451,
we readily see that, by subtracting the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many
times as there are terms less one; thus, by taking away 2 in
the fifth term, 2 + 3-1-3 + 3 + 3, we have 3 taken 4 times.
Rcle. Divide the difference of the extremes by the number
of terms less one.
ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION.

the distance daily by a common difference; the first day he
walked 3 miles, and the 14th day 9^ miles; how many miles
did he walk each day?
When we have found the common difference we may add it once, twice, etc., to
the first term, and we have the series, and consequently the means.
Ans. 3, 3£, 4, 4£, 5, 5£, etc.
Case III.
453. To find the number of terms when the ex-
tremes and common difference are given.
Examining the series, 2, 5, 8, 11,14, analyzed in 451,
we also see that after taking away the first term from any
term, we have left the common difference taken as many
times ti the number of terms, less 1.
Rule. Divide the difference of the extremes by the common
difference, and add 1 to the quotient.
Examples for Practice.
1. The extremes are 7 and 43, and the common difference
is 4; what is the number of terms? Ans. 10.
2. The first term is 2£, the last term is 40, and the common
difference is 7£; what is the number of terms? Ans. 6.
3. A laborer agreed to build a fence on the following con-
ditions: for the first rod he was to have 6 cents, with an in-
crease of 4 cents on each successive rod; the last rod came
to 226 cents; how many rods did he build? Ans. 56 rods.
331
Case IV.
454. To find the sum of all the terms when the
extremes and number of terms are given.
To deduce a rule lor finding the sum of all the terms, we
will take the series 2, 5, 8, 11,14, writing it under itself in
an inverse order, and add each term; thus,
2 + 5 + 8 + 11 +14 = 40, once the sum.
14 f 11 + 8 + 5 + 2 = 40, " ""
16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 80, twice the sum.
Here we perceive that 16, the sum of the extremes, mul-
tiplied by 5, the number of terms, equals 80, which is twice
the sum of the series. Dividing 80 by 2 gives 40, which is
the sum required.
Rule. Multiply the sum of the extremes by the number of
terms, and divide the product by 2.
Examples for Practice.
1. The extremes are 5 and 32, and the number of terms
12 ; what is the sum of all the terms? Ans. 222.
2. How many strokes does a common clock make in 12
hours? Ans. 78 strokes.
3. What debt can be discharged in a year by weekly pay-
ments in arithmetical progression, the first being $24, and
the last $1224?" Ans. $32448.
4. Suppose 100 apples were placed in a line 2 yards apart,
and a basket 2 yards from the first apple; how far would a
"boy travel to gather them up singly, and return with each
separately to the basket? Ans. 20200 yardc.
GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION.
4:55. A Geometrical Progression is a series of num-
bers increasing or decreasing by a constant multiplier.
When the multiplier ij greater than a unit, the series is
ascending; thus, 2, G, 18, 54, 162, is an ascending series,
in which 3 is the multiplier.
When the multiplier is less than a unit, the series is de-
scending j thus, 162, 54, 18, 6, 2, is a descending series, in
which ^ is the multiplier.
45G. The Ratio is the constant multiplier.
4:51. In every geometrical progression there are five
parts to be considered, any three of which being given, the
other two may be determined. They are as follows: The
first term, last term, ratio, number of terms, and the sum of
all the terms.
The first and last terms are the extremes, and the inter-
mediate terms are the means.
Case I.
458. To find any term, tho first term, the ratio,
and number of terms being given.
The first term is supposed to exist independently of the
ratio. Using the ratio once as a factor, we have the second
term; using it twice, or its second power, we have the third
term; using it three times, or its third power, we have the
fourth term; and, in general, the power of the ratio in any
term is one less than the number of the term. The ascend-
ing series, 2, 6, 18, 54, may be analyzed thus: 2, 2 x 3, 2
x3x 3, 2x3x3x3.
In this illustration we see that
1st term, 2, is independent of the ratio.
2d term, 6 = 2x3 = the first term into the 1st power of
the ratio.
3d term, 18 = 2 x38 = the first term into the 2d power
of the ratio.
4th term, 54 = 2 x 33 = the first term into the 3d power
of the ratio.
Rule. Multiply the first term by that power of the ratio
denoted by the number of terms less 1.
333
Examples for Practice.
1. The first term of a geometrical series is 4, the ratio is
3; what is the 9th term? Ans. 4 x 38 = 26244.
2. The first term is 1024, the ratio f_, and the number of
terms 8; what is the last term? Ans. -fa.
3. A boy bought 9 oranges, agreeing to pay 1 mill for
the first orange, 2 mills for the second, and so on; what
did the last orange cost him? Ans. $.256.
4. The first term is 7, the ratio \, and the number of
terms 7 ; what is the last term? Ans. y-j-^pf.
5. What is the amount of $1 at compound interest for 5
years, at 7 per cent. per annum? Ans. 81.40255+.
In the above example the first term is $1, the ratio is $1.07, and the number of
terms is 6. .
6. A drover bought 7 oxen, agreeing to pay $3 for the
first ox, $9 for the second, $27 for the third, and so on;
what did the last ox cost him? Ans. $2187.
Case II.
459. To find the sum of all the terms, the ex-
tremes and ratio being given.
If we take the series 2, 8, 32, 128, 512, in which the ratio
is 4, multiply each term by the ratio, and add the terms
thus multiplied, we shall have
8 + 32 + 128 + 512 + 2048 = 2728 = | ^Xhe"t?rms? sDm °'
But 2 + 8 + 32 + 128 + 512 = 682=
Hence, by subtracting, we get 2048- 2 = 2040 =
Dividing by 3, the ratio less one, 2046 -s-3 = 082 =
Once the sum of all tho
terms.
Three times the sum ol
all the terms.
Once the sum of all tho
terms.
The subtraction is performed by taking the lower line or
series from the tipper. All the terms cancel except 2048
and 2. Taking their difference, which is 3 times the sum,
and dividing by 3, the ratio less one, we must have the
sum of all the terms.
PEOMISUUOUS EXAMPLES.
Rule. Multiply the greater extreme by the ratio, subtract
•the less extreme from the product, and divide the remainder
by the ratio less 1.
* Let every decreasing aeries be inverted, and the first term called the last; then the
ratio will be greater than a unit. If the series be infinite, the first term is a cipher.

ratio is 4; what is the sum of the series? Ans. 349524.

term 2, and the ratio -J; what is the sum? Ans. 242.

THE METRIC SYSTEM.*

10 Decimeters, or 100 Centimeters, in length. 1 Cu. Centimeter.
Scale ,'a of the Mxact Sine. Exact Size.
481. The Metric System of Weights and Measures
has now received the sanction of law among more than half
the inhabitants of the civilized world. Up to this date it
has been adopted in France, Germany, Austria, the Nether-
lands, Southern Europe, and South America, and has been
bgalized in Great Britain, Germany, and the United
States.
* The Metric System, as it was presented in all the editions of this
book, printed previous to 1877, was useless, because the symbols and
applications did not correspond with present usage.
This will be a sufficient reason for substituting in place of the
former matter, a condensed and practical treatise of the system,
together with some useful miscellaneous tables.
METRIC SYSTEM.
482. The Metric System of weights and measures is based
upon the decimal scale.
483. The Meter is the base of the system, and is the one ten
millionth part of the distance on the earth's surface from the equator
to either pole, or 39.37079 inches.
From the Meter are made the Ar (are), the Liter (leeter), and the
Oram; these constitute the primary or principal units of the system,
from which all the others are derived.
484. The Multiple Units, or higher denominations, are
named by prefixing to the name of the primary units the Greek
numerals, Deka (10), Hecto (100), KUo (1000), and Myra (10000).
485. The Sllb-Mllltiple Units, or lower denominations, are
named by prefixing to the names of the primary units the Latin
numerals, Deci (-fa), Centi (jjj), Mttli (nfcj)-
Hence, it is apparent from the name of a unit whether it is greater
or less than the standard unit, and also how many times.
Meter means measure; and the three principal units are length,
capacity or volume, and weight.

The Centimeter and Millimeter are used by mechanics and others
for minute lengths. The Dekameler, Hektometer, and Myriameter are
seldom used.
The Square and Cubic Measures are only the squares and cubes of
the measures of length, as shown in the following tables.

The Cubic Meter is the unit for measuring ordinary solids.
The Ster is the unit of wood measure, and is equal to a cubic
meter, or .2759 cord.
A Cubic Meter of water weighs 1000 kilos, or a metric ton.
The scale for the meter, liter and gram is uniformly 10; but in the
Bcale for the square meter, 100 units of any order make one unit of
the next higher; and in the scale for the cubic meter, 1000 units of
any order make one of the next higher.

METRIC SYSTEM.
491. METRIC NOTATION AND NUMERATION.
The Metric System is based upon the Arabic Notation,
the denominations corresponding with the orders of the
Arabic notation; and hence is written like United States
Money, the lowest denomination at the right, as illustrated
in the following
The number is read 67015.638 meters; or if expressed iD
centimeters it is read 6701563.8 centimeters; if in kilometers^
it is read 67.015638 kilometers; or, it may be read 6 myria*
meters, 7 kilometers, 0 hektometers, 1 dekameter, 5 meters,
6 decimeters, 3 centimeters, 8 millimeters.
The names mill, cent, dime, used in United States Money, corres-
pond to milli, centi, deci, in the Metric System. Hence the eagU
might be called the deka-dollar, since it is 10 dollars ; the dime, a deci
dollar, since it is fa of a dollar, etc.
Write 3672.045 grams, and read it in the several orders;
read it in hektograms; in kilograms; in decigrams; hf.
centigrams.
Rule.— Write in their consecutive order the several denom-
inations, and place a decimal point between the given denom-
ination and those of lower denominations.
1. Read 1456.34 liters, in metric units; read it in centi-
liters; in dekaliters; in hektoliters.
2. Read 795 centars in metric units; in ars.
3. Write 6 kilometers, 7 dekameters, and 3 decimeters, as
meters. Ans. 6070.3 meters.
4. How many liters in 5 kiloliters, 4 hektoliters, 7 liters,

operation. AnalysM. The meter is
3.6 Km. x 1000 — 3600 M. the principal unit of the table;
39.37 in. x 3600 = 141732 in. hence we reduce the kilome-
11-1 woo • ia . it on 4i. tera to meters. Since there
141732 in. -f-12 in.=11811 ft . „ , , . x
are 39.37 inches in a meter, in
S6OO meters there are 3600 times 39.37 inches; and since there are
12 inches in a foot, there are as many feet as 12 inches are contained
times in 141732 inches. Therefore 3.0 Km. are equal to 11811 feet.
Rule. Reduce the given quantity to the denomination of
the principal unit of the table; multiply by the equivalent,
and reduce the product to the required denomination.

operation. Analysis. The
10 lbs. 4 oz. = 10.25 lbs. gram, the principal
10.25 lbs. x 7000 = 71750 gr. unit of the table-58
71750 gr. -=-15.432 gr. = 4649.43 G. expressed m grains
4649.43 G.+1000 = 4.64943 Kg., Ans. ^ZT^T^
to grains. 15.432 grains make one gram; hence there are as many
grams in 71750 grains as 15.432 grains is contained times in 71750
grains. And since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram, dividing
4649.43 G. by 1000 will give the kilograms in 10 lb. 4 oz. Therefore,
10 lb. 4 oz. is equal to 4.61943 Kg.
Rule. Reduce the given quantity to the denomination in
which the equivalent of the principal unit of the metric table
is expressed j divide by this equivalent, and reduce the quo-
tient to the required denomination.
