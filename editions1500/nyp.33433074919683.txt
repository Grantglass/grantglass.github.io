E Publiftier of this fplendid Edition
of ROBINSON CRUSOE has often ex-
perienced the mod liberal encouragement for
works which, being large, might feem ha-
zardous for an individual; but on no occa-
fion has he been honoured and affifted by
a Subfcription more adequate to the great-
nefs of his expences, or more encouraging
to the activity of his future endeavours.—•
He begs leave to return his sincere thanks;
and he will only add, that his gratitude for
fuch repeated favours will continue through
life.

THE
PREFACE,
T F ever the ftory of any private man's ad-
. ventures in the world were worth making
public, and were acceptable when publifhed,
the Editor of this account thinks this will be
fo.
The wonders of this man's life exceeds all
that (he thinks) is to be found extant; the life
of one man being fcarce capable of a greater
variety.
The story is told with modesty, with fe-
rioufnefs, and with a religious application of
events to the ufes to which wife men always
apply them; viz. to the instruction of others,
by this example, and to juftify and honour
the wifdom of Providence in all the variety
of circumftances, let them happen how they
will.
The
Xll P R E F A C E.
The Editor believes the thing to be a juft
hiftory of facts; neither is there any appearance
of fiction in it: and however thinks, because all fuch things are disputed, that the improve-
ment of it, as well to the diverfion, as to the
instruction of the Reader, will be the fame;
and as fuch, he thinks, without farther com-
pliment to the world, he does them a great
fervice in the publication.

ADVENTURES
O F
ROBINSON CRUSOE,
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of Tork,
of a good family, though not of that country,
my father being a foreigner of Breman, who fettled
first at Hull: he got a good estate by merchandize,
and leaving off his trade, lived afterward at York,from whence he had married my mother, whofe
relations were named Robinson,a very good family
in that country, and from whom I was called Robin-
fan KreutzTiaer; but by the ufual corruption of words
in England, we are now called, nay we call ourfelves,
and write our name Crufoc, and fo my companions
always called me.
I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieu-
tenant colonel to an Englishregiment of foot in
Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous colo-
VOL. I. B nel
2 LIFE AND ADVENTURES-
nel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dun-
kirk against the Spaniards; what became of my
fecond brother I never knew, any more than my
father or mother did know what was become of me..
Being the third fon of the family, and not bred
to any trade, my head began to be filled very early
with rambling thoughts: my father, who was very
ancient, had given me a competent fhare of learning,
as far as houfe education, and a country free-fchoot
generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I
would be fatisfied with nothing but going to fea, and
my inclination to this led me fo ftrongly againft the
will, nay the commands of my father, and againft
all the entreaties and perfuafions of my mother and
other friends, that there feemed to be something fatal
in that propenfion of nature tending directly to the
life of mifery which was to befall me.
My father, a wife and grave man, gave me feri-
ous and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my defign. He called me one morning into
his chamber, where he was confined by the gout,
and expoftulated very warmly with me upon this sub ject: he walked me what reafons more than a meer
wandring inclination I had for leaving my father's.
houfe and my native country, where I might be well
introduced, and had a prospect of raifing my fortune
by application and induflry, with a life of eafe and-
pleafure- He told me it was for men of defperate
fortunes on one hand, or of afpiring, fuperior for-
tunes on the other, who went abroad upon adven-
tures, to rife by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the com-
mon road; that thefe things were all either too far
above
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. 3
above me, or too far below me; that mine was the
middle state, or what might be called the upper fta-
tion of low life,which he had found by long expe-
rience was the belt ftate in the world, the moft
fuited to human happinefs, not expofed to the mi-
feries and hardfhips, the labour and fufferings of the
mechanick part of mankind, and not embarrafs'd with
the pride, luxury, ambition and envy of the upper
part of mankind. He told me, I might judge of
the happinefs of this ftate, by this one thing, viz*
That this was the ftate of life which all other people
envied; that kings have frequently lamented the
miferable confequences of being born to great things,
and wish they had been placed in the middle of the
two extremes, between the mean and the great;
that the wife man gave his testimony to this as the
juft ftandard of true felicity, when he prayed to have
neither poverty or riches.
He bid me obferve it, and I would always find, that the calamities of life were fhared among the
upper and lower part of mankind; but that the middle
flation had the feweft difafters, and was not expofed
to fo many viciffitudes as the higher or lower part
.of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to fo many
diftempers and uneafmefles either of body or mind,
as thofe were, who by vicious living, luxury and ex-
travagancies on one hand, or by hard labour, want
of necessaries, and mean or infufficient diet on the
other hand, bring diftempers upon themfelves by
the natural confequences of their* way of living;
that the middle station of life was calculated for all
kind of virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that
B 2 peace
peace and plenty were the hand-maids of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietnefs^
health, fociety, all agreeable diverfions, and all dewfireable pleafures, were the bleffings attending the
middle ftation of life; that this way men went filently
and fmoothly through the world, and comfortably
out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the
hands or of the head, not fold to the life of flavery
for daily bread, or harraffed with perplexed circum-
stances, which rob the foul of peace, and the body
'of reft; not enraged with the paffion of envy, of
fecret burning luft of ambition for great things; but
ineafy circumftances fliding gently through theworld,
and fenfibly tafting the fweets of living, without the
bitter, feeling that they are happy, and learning by
every day's experience to know it more sensibly. After this, he preffed me earneftly, and in the
moft affectionate manner, not to play the young
man, not to precipitate myfelf into miferies which
nature and the station of life I was born in feemed
to have provided againft; that I was under no ne-
ceffity of feeking my bread; that he would do well
for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the
Ration of life which he had been just recommending
to me; and that if I was not very eafy and happy in
the world, it muft be my meer fate or fault that muf
t
hinder it, and that he would have nothing to anfwer
for, having thus difcharged his duty in warning me
against meafures which he knew would be to my
hurt: in a wordv that as he would do very kind
things for me if I would ftay and fettle at home as he
directed, fo he would not have fo much hand in my
misfortunes, as to give me any encouragement to go
away:
away: and to clofe all, he told me I had my elder
brother for an example, to whom he had ufed the
fame earneft perfuaficns to keep him from going into
the low country wars, but could not prevail, his
young defires prompting him to run into the army,
where he was killed; and though he faid he would
not ceafe to pray for me, yet he would venture to lay
to me, that if I did take this foolish ftep, God would
not blefs me, and I would have leifure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counfel when there
might be none to allifi in my recovery.
I obferved in this laft part of his difcourfe, which
was truly prophetick, though I fuppofe my father
did not know it to be fo himfelf; I fay, I obferved
the tears run down his face very plentifully, and ef-
pecially when he fpoke of my brother who was killed;
and that when he fpoke of my having leifure to
repent, and none to airlift me, he was fo moved, that
he broke off the difcourfe, and told me, his heart
was fo full, he could fay no more to me.
I was fincerely affected with this difcourfe, as
indeed who could be otherwife? and I refolved not
to think of going abroad any more, but to fettle
at home according to my father's defire. But alas!
a few days wore it all off; and in short, to prevent
any of my father's farther importunities, in a few
weeks after, I refolved to run quite away from him.
However, I did not act fo haflily neither as my firft
heat of refolution prompted, but I took my mother,
at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter than
ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were fo
entirely bent upon feeing the world, that I would never fettle to any thing with refolution enough to go
B 3 through 6 LIFE AND ADVENTURESthrough with it, and my father had better give me
his confent than force me to go without it; that I
was now eighteen years old, which was too late to
go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney;
that I was fure, if I did, I fhould never ferve out my
time, and I would certainly run away from my
mailer before my time was out, and go to fea; and
if me would fpeak to my father to let me go one
voyage abroad, if I came home again and did not
like it, I would go no more, and I would prqmife by
a double diligence to recover that time I had loft.
This put my mother into a great passion : me told
me, me knew it would be to no purpofe to fpeak to
my father upon any fuch subject, that he knew too
well what was my interest to give his confent to any
fuch thing fo much for my hurt, and that me won-
dered how I could think of any fuch thing after fuch
a difcourfe as I had had with my father, and fuch
kind and tender expressions as me knew my father
had ufed to me; and that in fhort, if I would ruin
myfelf, there was no help for me; but I might de-
pend I would never have their confent to it: that
for her part me would not have fo much hand in my
destruction ; and I would never have it to fay, that
my mother was willing when my father was not.
Though my mother refufed to move it to my
father, yet, as I have heard afterwards, me reported
all the difcourfe to him, and that my father, after
mowing a great concern at it, faid to her with a figh,
"That boy might be happy if he would ftay at home,
but if he goes abroad, he will be the moft mife.r-
ableft wretch that was ever born; I can give no
confent to it."
It
It was not till almoft a year after this that I broke
loose, though in the mean time I continued obftinate-
ly deaf to all propofals of fettling to bufinefs, and
frequently expoftulating with my father and mother,
about their being fo pofitively determined againlt
-what they knew my inclinations prompted me to.
But being one day at Hull, where I went cafually,
and without any purpofe of making an elopement
that time; but I fay, being there, and one of my
companions being going by fea to London, in his fa-
ther's ship, and prompting me to go with them, with
the common allurement of fea-faring men, viz.
That it mould coft me nothing for my passage, I
ronfulted neither father or mother any more, not fo
much as fent them word of it; but leaving them to
hear of it as they might, without asking God's blef-
sing, or my father's, without any confideration of
circumftances or confequences, and in an ill hour,
God knows, .on the first of September 1651, I went
on board a ship bound for London; never any young
adventurer's misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or
continued longer than mine. The fhip was no fooner
gotten out of the Plumber, but the wind began to
blow, and the waves to rife in a moft frightful man-
ner; and as I had never been at fea before, I was
moft inexpreffible fick in body, and terrify'd in my
mind: I began now ferioufly to reflet): upon what I
had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the
judgment of heaven for my wicked leaving my father's
houfe, and abandoning my duty; all the good
counsel of my parents, my father's tears and my mo-
ther's entreaties came now frefh into my mind, and
my confcience, which was not yet come to the pitch
E 4 of
of hardnefs to which it has been fince, reproached
me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of
my duty to God and my father.
All this while the storm encreafed, and the fea,
which I had never been upon before, went very high,
though nothing like what I have feen many times
force ; no, nor like what I faw a few days after:
but it was enough to affect me then, who was but
a young failor, and had never known any thing of
the matter. I expected every wave would have
fwallowed us up, and that every time the fhip fell
down, as I thought, in the trough or hollow of the
fea, we would never rife more; and in this agony of
mind, I made many vows and refolutions, that if it
would pleafe God here to fpare my life this one
voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land
again, I would go directly home to my father, and
never fet it into a lip again while I lived ; that I
would take his advice, and never run myfelf into
fuch miferies as thefe any more. Now I faw plainly
the goodnefs of his obfervations about the middle
ftation of life, how eafy, how comfortably he had
lived all his days, and never had been expofed to
tempefts at fea, or troubles on more; and I refolved
that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go
home to my father.
Thefe wife and fober thoughts continued all the
while the ftorm continued, and indeed fome time
after; but the next day the wind was abated and
the fea calmer, and I began to be a little inur'd to it:
however I was' very grave for all that day, being alfo
a little fea-fick ftill; but towards night the weather
cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charm-
ing
ing fine evening followed; the fun went down per-
fectly clear, and rofe fo the next morning; and
having little or no wind, and a frnooth fea, the fun
mining upon it, the fight was, as I thought, the
moft delightful that ever I faw.
I had slept well in the night, and was now no
more fea-fick, but very chearful, looking with won-
der upon the fea that was fo rough and terrible the
day before, and could be fo calm and fo pleafant in
fo little time after. And now, leaft my good refolu-
tions fhould continue, my companion, who had in-
deed enticed me away, comes to me, ** Well, Bob,"
fays he, (clapping me upon the moulder,) how do
you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, iva'n't
you, loft night, when it blew but a cap full of wind? A
(ap full do you call it? faid I, it was a terrible farm:
Ajiorm,you fool you, replies he, do you call that ajiorm?
why it was nothing at all; give us but a good Jhip and
fea-room, and we think nothing of fuch afqual of wind
as that; but you're but afrejh-waterfailor, Bob ; come
let us make a bowl of punch and we'll forget all that;
do you fee what charming weather it is now? To make'
fhort this fad part of my story, we went the old way
of all failors, the punch was made, and I was made.
drunk with it, and in that one night's wickednefs I
• drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon
my part conduct, and all my refolutions for my
future, In a word, as the fea was returned to its
fmoothnefs of furface and fettled calmnefs by the
abatement of that ftorm, fo the hurry of my thoughts
being over, my fears and apprehenfions of being
fwallowed up by the fea being forgotten, and the
current of my former defires returned, I entirely for-
got
got the vows and promifes that I made in my diftrefs.
I found indeed fome intervals of reflection, and the
ferious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again fometimes, but I look them off, and
rouzed myfelf from them as it were from a diftemper,
and applying myfelf to drinking and company, foon
maftered the return of thofe fits, for fo I called them,
and I had in five or fix days got as compleat a vic-
tory over confcience as any young fellow that re-
folved not to be troubled with it, could defire: But
I was to have another trial for it ftill; and Provi-
dence, as in fuch cafes generally it does, refolved to
leave me entirely without excufe. For if I would
not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be
fuch a one as the worf t and moft hardened wretch
among us would confefs both the danger and the
mercy.
The fixth day of our being at fea we came into
Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary,
and the weather calm, we had made but little way
fince the ftorm. Here we were obliged to come to
anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing con-
trary, viz. at fouth-weft, for feven or eight days,
during which time a great many mips from Newcastlecame into the fame roads, as the common har-
bour where the mips might wait for a wind for the
river.
We had not however rid here fo long, but mould
have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew
too fresh ; and after we had lain four or five days,
blew very hard. However, the roads being reckoned
as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our
ground-tackle very strong, our men were uncon-
cerned,
cerned, and not in the leaft apprehenfive of danger,
but fpent the time in reft and mirth, after the
manner of the fea; but the eighth day in the morning,
the wind increafed, and we had all hands at work
to ftrike our top-mafts, and make every thing fnug
and clofe, that the fhip might ride as eafy aspoffible.
By noon the fea went very high indeed, and our fhip
rid forecastlein, fhipp'd i'everal feas, and we thought
once or twice our anchor had come home; upon
which our mafter ordered out the meet anchor; fo
that we rode with two anchors a-head, and the cables
veered out to the better end.
By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed, and
now I began to fee terror and amazement in the
faces even of the feamen themfelves. The mafter,
though vigilant in the bufinefs of preferving the lip, yet as he went in and out of his cabbin by me, I
could hear him foftly to himfelf fay feveral times,
Lord be merciful to us, we flail be all lost,we shallbe
all undone; and the like. During thefe firft hurries,
I was ftupid, lyingflill in my cabbin, which was in the
fteerage, and cannot describe my temper: I could ill
re-aflume the firft penitence which I had fo apparently
trampled upon, and hardened myfelf againft: I
thought the bitternefs of death had been paft, and
that this would be nothing to like the firft. But
when the mafter himfelf came by me, as I faid just now, and faid we would be all loft, I was dreadfully
frighted: I got up out of my cabbin, and looked
out; but fuch a difnial fight I never faw: the fea
went mountains high, and broke upon us every three
or four minutes: when I could look about, I could
fee nothing but diftrefs round us: two ships that rid
near
near us, we found, had cut their mails by the
board, being deep loaden; and our men cryed out,
that a fhip which rid about a mile a-head of us was
foundered. Two more lips being driven from their
anchors, were run out of the roads to fea, at all
adventures, and that with not a maft ftanding. The
light mips fared the belt, as not fo much labouring
in the fea; but two or three of them drove, and
came clofc by us, running away with only their fprit-
fail out before the wind.
'Towards evening the mate and boatfwain begged
the mailer of our fhip to let them cut away the fore mast, which he was very unwilling to: but the boat-
fwain protesting to him, that if he did not, the fhip
would founder, he commented; and when they had
cut away the foremast, the mainmast ftood fo loofe,
and fhook the fhip fo much, they were obliged to
cut her away alfo, and make a clear deck.
Any one may judge what a condition I muft be in
at all this, who was but a young failor, and,who had been in fuch a fright before at but a little. But if I
can exprefs at this distance the thoughts I had about
me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of
mind upon account of my former convictions, and
the having returned from them to the refolutions I
had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death it.
felf; and thefe, added to the terror of the ftorm,
put me in fuch a condition, that I can by no words
defcribe it. But the worft was not come yet, the
storm continued with fuch fury, that the feamen
themfelves acknowledged they had never known a
worfe. We had a good lip, but fhe was deep loaden,
and wallowed in the fea, that the feamen. every now
and then cried out, fhe would founder. It was my
advantage in one respect, that I did not know what
they meant by founder, till I enquired. However,
the storm was fo violent, that I faw what is not often
feen, the mafter, the boat-fwain, and fome others
more fenfible than the reft, at their prayers, and ex-
pelling every moment when the fhip would go to the
bottom, In the middle of the night, and under all
the reft of our diftrefl'es, one of the men that had
been down on purpofe to fee, cried out we had fprung
aleak; another faid there was four foot water in the
hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At
that very word my heart, as I thought, died within
me, and I fell backwards upon the fide of my bed
where I fat, into the cabbin. However, the men
rouzed me, and told me, that I that was able to do
nothing before, was as well able to pump as another;
at which I stirred up, and went to the pump and
worked very heartily. While this was doing, the
master feeing fome light colliers, who not able to
ride out the ftorm, were obliged to slip and run away
to fea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a
gun as a fignal of diftrefs. I who knew nothing what
that meant, was fo furprized, that I thought the fhip
had broke, or fome dreadful thing happened. In a
word, I was fo furprized, that I fell down in a fwoon.
As this was a time when every body had his own life
to think of, no body minded me, or what was be-
come of me; but another man kept up to the pump,
and thrufting me afide with his foot, let me lye,
thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while
before I came to myfelf.
We
We worked on, but the water encreafmg in the
hold, it was apparent that the lip would founder,
and though the ftorm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not possible fhe could fwim till we might run
into a port, fo the mafter continued firing guns for
help; and a light fhip who had rid it out juft ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with
the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was
impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to
lie near the fhip fide, till at laft the men rowing very
heartily, and venturing their lives to fave ours, our
men call them a rope over the stern with a buoy to
it, and then vered it out a great length, which they
after great labour and hazard took hold of, and we
haul'd them clofe under our stern and got all into
their boat. It was to no purpofe for them or us after
we were in the boat to think of reaching to their own
ship, fo all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull
her in towards fhore as much as we could, and
our master promifed them, that if the boat was
ftaved upon more he would make it good to their
mafter, fo partly rowing and partly driving, our boat
went away to the norward, floaping towards the fhore
almoft asfar as Winterion-Ncfs.
We were not much more than a quarter of an
hour out of our fhip but we faw her fink, and then
I underftood for the first time what was, meant by a
fhip foundering in the fea; I muft acknowledge I had
hardly eyes to look up when the feamen told me
fhe was finking; for from that moment they rather
put me into the boat than that I might be faid to go
in, my heart was as it were dead within me, partly
with
with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the
thoughts of what was yet before me.
While we were in this condition, the men yet
labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the more,
we could fee, when our boat mounting the waves we
were able to fee the more, a great many people
running along the more to affift us when we would come near, but we made but flow way towards the
more, nor were we able to reach the fhore,
till being part the light-houfe at Winterton, the
more falls off to the weftward towards Cromer, and
fo the land broke off a little the violence of the wind:
here we got in, and, though not without much dif-
ficulty, got all fafe on more, and walked afterwards
on foot to Tarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we
were ufed with great humanity, as well by the ma-
giftrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters,
as by particular merchants and owners of lips, and
had money given us fufficient to carry us either to
London or back to Hull, as we thought fit.
Had I now had the fenfe to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and
my father, an emblem of our bleffed Saviour's
parable, had even killed the fatted calf for: me; for
hearing the fhip I went away in was call away in
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had
any afiurance that I was not drowned.
But my ill fate pufhed me on now with an obfti-
nacy that nothing could refift; and though I had
feveral times loud calls from my reafon and my more
compofed judgment to go home, yet I had no power
to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I
urge, that it is a fecret over-ruling decree that hur-
ries us on to be the inftruments of our own deftruc-
tion,
tion, even though it be before us, and that we puflt
upon it with our eyes open. Certainly nothing but
fome fuch decreed unavoidable mifery attending, and
which it was impoffible for me to efcape, could have
pufhed me forward againft the calm reafonings and
perfuafions of my mods retired thoughts, and againft
two fuch vifible mflructions as I had met with in my
firft attempt.
My comrade, who had helped to harden me be-
fore, and who was the master's fon, was now lefs
forward than I; the firft time he fpoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three days, for we were feparated in the town to
feveral quarters: I fay, the first time he faw me, it
appeared his tone was altered, and looking very me-
lancholy, and making his head, asked me how I did,
and telling his father who I was, and how I had
come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go
farther abroad; his father turning to me with a very
grave and concerned tone, young man, fays he, you
ought never to go to fleaany more, you ought to take
this for a plainand visibletoken that you are not to be a
feafaringman. Why, Sir, faid I, will you go to fea
no more? That is another cafe, faid he, it is my
calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made this
voyage for a trial, you fee what a taftc heaven has given
you of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this
is all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the /hip of
Tarfhifh. Pray, continues he, what are you? and
on what account did you go to fea? Upon that I told
him fame of my story ; at the end of which he burft
out with a ftrange kind of paffion; what had I done,
fays he, that fuch an unhappy wretch mould come
into
into my lip ; I would not fet my foot in the fame
fhip with thee again for a thoufand pounds. This
indeed was, as I faid, an excursion of his fpirits,
which were yet agitated by the fenfe of his loft, and
was farther than he could have authority to go.
However he afterwards talked very gravely to me,
exhorted me to go back to my father, and not tempt
Providence to my ruin; told me I might fee a vifible
hand of heaven against me, and young man, faid he,
depend upon it, if you do not go back, whereveryou
go, you will meet with nothing but difafters and difaf-
pointments, till your father's words are fulfilled upon you.
We parted foon after; for I made him little an-
fwer, and I faw him no more; which way he went,
I know not. As for me, having fome money in
my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there,
as well as on the road, had many ftruggles with my-
felf, what courfe of life I fhould take, and whether
I would go home, or go to fea.
As to going home, lame oppofed the belt mo-
tions that offered to my thoughts; and it im-
mediately occurred to me how I would be laughed
at among the neighbours, and would be ashamed to
fee, not my father and mother only, but even every
body elfe; from whence I have fince often obferved,
how incongruous and irrational the common tem-
per of mankind is, efpecially of youth, to that reafon
which ought to guide them in fuch cafes, via. that
they are not afhamed to fm, and yet are ashamed to
repent; nor afhamed of the action for which they
ought justly to be efteemed fools, but are ashamed of
the returning, which only can make them be efteemed
wife men.
, Voi,. I. Q In
'
In this state of life however I remained fome time,
uncertain what measures to take, and what courfe of
life to lead. An irrefiftible reluctance continued to
going home; and as I stayed a while, the remem-
brance of the distress I had been in wore off; and
as that abated, the little motion I had in my defires
to a return wore off with it, till at laft I quite laid
aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a vovage.
That evil influence which carried me firft away
from my father's house, that hurried me into the wild
and indigefted notion of raising my fortune; and
that impreft thofe conceits fo forcibly upon me, as
to make me deaf to all good advice, and to the
entreaties and even the command of my father: I fay,
the fame influence, whatever it was, prefented the
mof t unfortunate of all enterprizes to my view; and
I went on board a veflel bound to the coaft of Africa)or as our failors vulgarly call it, a voyage to Guinea.
It was my great misfortune that in all thefe adven-
tures I did not fhip myfelf as a failor; whereby,
though I might indeed have worked a little harder
than ordinary, yet at the fame time I had learned the
duty and office of a foremast man; and in time might
have qualified myfelf for a mate or lieutenant, if not
for a mafter. But as it was always my fate to choofe
for the worfe, fo I did here; for having money in my pocket, and good cloaths upon my back, I would
always go on board in the habit of a gentleman; and
fo I neither had any bufmefs in the ship, or learned
to do any.
It was my lot first of all to fall into pretty good
company in London, which does not always happen
to fuch look and unguided young fellows as I then
'; was;
. .,~
•
Vvas; the devil generally not omitting to lay
fnare for them very early: but it was not fo with me,
I first fell acquainted with the matter of a lip who
had been on the coaft of Guinea; and who having had
very good fuccefs there, was refolved to go again;
and who taking a fancy to my converfation, which
was not at all difagreeble at that time, hearing me
fay I had a mind to fee the world, told me if I would
go the voyage with him I would be at no expence; I
fhould be his mefs-mate and his companion, and if I
could carry any thing with me, I should have all the
advantage of it that the trade would admit; and
perhaps I might meet with fome encouragement.
I embraced the offer, and entering into a strict friendship with this captain, who was an honeft and
plain-dealing man, I went the voyage with him, and
carried a finall adventure with me, which by the dif-
interefted honesty of my friend the captain, I in-
creafed very coufiderably; for I carried about 40 /.
in fuch toys and trifles as the captain directed me to
buy. This 40 /. I had muftered together by the affift-
ance of fome of my relations whom I correfponded
with, and who, I believe, got my father, or at leaf
t
my mother, to contribute fo much as that to my first adventure.
This was the only voyage which I may fay was
fuccefsful in all my adventures, and which I owe to
the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain,
under whom alfo I got a competent knowledge of the
mathematicks and the rules of navigation, learned
how to keep an account of the fhip's courfe, take an
obfervation, and, in short, to understand fome things
that were needful to be underftood by a failor: for,
C a at
as he took delight to inftruft me, I took delight to
learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both
a failor and a merchant: for I brought home 5 pound
9 ounces of gold dult for myadventure, whichyielded
me in London at my return, almoft 3007. and this
filled me with thofe afpiring thoughts which have
fmce fo compleated my ruin.
Yet even in this voyage I had my misfortunes too;
particularly, that I was continually fick, being thrown
into a violent calenture by the excessive heat of the
climate; our principal trading being upon the coaft,
from the latitude of 15 degrees north even to the
line itfelf.
I was now fet up for a Guinea trader; and my
friend, to my great misfortune, dying foon after his
arrival, I refolved to go the fame voyage again, and
I embarked in the fame veffel with one who was his
mate in the former voyage, and had now got the
command of the fhip. This was the unhappiest voyage that ever man made; for though I did not
carry quite 100 /. of my new gained wealth, fo that I
had 200 left, and which I lodged with my friend's
widow, who was very juft to me, yet I fell into terri-
ble misfortunes in this voyage; and the firft was
this, viz. Our fhip making her courfe towards the
Canary Islands, or rather between thofe iflands and
the African more, was furprized in the grey of the
morning, by a Turkishrover of Sallee,who gave
chafe to us with all the fail me could make. We
crowded alfo as much canvafs as our yards would
fpread, or our mafts carry, to have got clear; but finding the pirate gained upon us, and would certainly
come up with us in a few hours, we prepared to fight;
our
our lip having 12 guns, and the rogue 18. About
three in the afternoon he came up with us, and
bringing too by mistake juft athwart our quarter,
inftead of athwart our ftern, as he intended, we
brought 8 of our guns to bear on that fide, and
poured in a broadside upon him, which made him
fheer off again, after returning our fire, and pouring
in alfo his finall mot from near 200 men which he
had on board. However, we had pot a man touched,
all our men keeping clofe. He prepared to attack
us again, and we to defend ourfelves; but laying us
on board the next time upon our other quarter, he
entered 60 men upon our decks, who immediately
fell to cutting and hacking the decks and rigging.
We plyed them with finall-mot, half-pikes, powder-
chests, and fuch like, and cleared our deck of them
twice. However, to cut fhort this melancholy part
of our ftory, our mip being disabled, and three of
our men killed, and eight wounded, we were obliged
to yield, and were carried all prifoners into Sallee, a
port belonging to the Moors.
The ufage I had there was not fo dreadful as at first I apprehended, nor was I carried up the country to
the emperor's court, as the reft of our men were, but
was kept by the captain of the rover, as his proper
prize, and made his flave, being young and nimble,
and fit for his bufinefs. At this furpiizing change of
my circumftances, from a merchant to a miferable
flave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I
looked back upon my father's prophetic difcourfe to
me, that I would be miserable, and have none to
relieve me, which I thought was now fo effectually
brought to pafs, that I could not be worfe; that now
C 3 the
the hand of heaven had overtaken me, and I was un-
done without redemption. But alas! this was but a
taste of the mifery I was to go through, as will appear
in the fequel of this ftory.
As my new patron or master had taken me home
to his houfe, fo I was in hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to fea again, believing
that it would fome time or other be his fate to be
taken by a Spanishor Portugal man of war; and that
then I should be fet at liberty. But this hope of
mine was foon taken away; for when he went to fea,
he left me on more to look after his little garden,
and do the common drudgery of Hayes about his
houfe; and when he came home again from his
cruife, he ordered me to lye in the cabbin to look
after the lip. Here I meditated nothing but my efcape; and
what method I might take to effect it, but found no
way that had the leaft probability in it: nothing pre-
fented to make the fuppofition of it rational; for I
had no body to communicate it to, that would em-
bark with me, no fellow-flave, no Englishman,Irish-man, or Scotsmanthere but myfelf; fo that for two
years, though I often pleafed myfelf with the imagi-
nation, yet I never had the leaft .encouraging prof-
pect of putting it in practice.
After about two years an odd circumftance pre-
fented itfelf, which put the old thought of making
fome attempt for my liberty again in my head: my
patron lying at home longer than ufual, without fit-
ting out his lip, which, as I heard, was for want
of money, he ufed constantly, once or twice a week,
fometimes oftener, if the weather was fair,, to take
the
the fhip's pinnace, and go out into the road a nfhing;
and as he always took me and a young Marefco with
him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and
I proved very dexterous in catching fifh; insomuch that fometimes he would fend me with a Moor, one of
his kinfmen, and the youth the Marefco as they called
him, to catch a difh of fifh for him.
It happened one time, that going a fishing in a
ftark calm morning, a fog rofe fo thick, that though
we were not half a league from the shore we loft fight
of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which
way, we laboured all day, and all the next night,
and when the morning came we found we had pulled
off to fea inftead of pulling in for the shore ; and
that we were at leaft two leagues from the shore :
however we got well in again, though with a great
deal of labour, and fome danger; for the wind began
to blow pretty fresh in the morning; but particularly
we were all very hungry.
But our patron, warn'd by this difafter, refolved to
take more care of himfelf for the future; and having
lying by him the long-boat of our Englishfhip he had
taken, he refolved he would not go a riming any
more without a compass and fome provifion; fo he
ordered the carpenter of his ship, who alfo was an
Englishflave, to build a little ftate-room or cabbin in
the middle of the long-boat, like that of a barge, with .
a place to stand behind it to fteer and hale home the
main-meet; and room before for a hand or two to
Rand and work the fails; fhe failed with that we call
a fhoulder of mutton fail; and the boom gibed over
the top of the cabbin, which lay very fnug and low,
€4 . . and
and had in it room for him to lye, with a slave or
two, and a table to eat on, with fome finall lockers
to put in fome bottles of fuch liquor as he thought fit
to drink; particularly his bread, rice and coffee.
We went frequently out with this boat a fishing, and as I was moft dextrous to catch fish for him, he
never went without me: It happened that he had
appointed to go out in this boat, either for pleafure
or for fifh, with two or three Moors of fome diflinc-
tion in that place, and for whom he had provided
extraordinarily; and had therefore fent on board the
boat over night a larger ftore of provifions than
ordinary; and had ordered me to get ready three
fuzees with powder and fhot, which were on board
his lip ; for that they defigned fome fport of fowling
-as well as fifhing.
I got all things ready as he had directed, and
waited the next morning with the boat wafhed clean,
her ancient and pendants out, and every thing to ac-
commodate his guests ; when by and by my patron
came on board alone, and told me his guefts had put
off going, upon fome buCnefs that fell out, and
ordered me with the man and boy, as ufual, to go
out with the boat and catch them fome fish, for that
his friends were to fup at his houfe; and commanded that as foon as I got fome fifh I would bring it home
to his houfe; all which I prepared to do.
This moment my former notions of deliverance
darted into my thoughts, for now I found I was like
to have a little fhip at my command; and my master being gone, I prepared to furnifh myfelf, not for fifh-
ing bulmefs, but for a voyage } though I knew not,
neither
..j
neither did I fo much as confider, whither I mould
fteer; for any where to get out of that place was
my way.
My firft contrivance was to make a pretence to
fpeak to this Moor, to get fomething for our fubfift-
ance on board; for I told him we muft not prefume
to eat of our patron's bread; he faid, that was true;
fo he brought a large bafket of rufk or bucket of their
kind, and three jarrs with frefh water into the boat;
I knew where my patron's cafe of bottles Hood, which
it was evident by the make were taken out of fome
Englishprize; and I conveyed them into the boat
while the Moor was on more, as if they had been
there before for our mafter: I conveyed alfo a great
lump of bees-wax into the boat, which weighed above
half a hundred weight, with a parcel of twine or
thread, a hatchet, a faw, and a hammer, all which
were of great ufe to us afterwards; efpecially the wax to make candles. Another trick I tryed upon him,
which he innocently came into alfo; his name was
Ifmael, who they call Mitly, or Moley; fo I called to
him, Mo'ey, faid I, our patron's guns are on board
the boat, can you not get a little powder and lot, it
may be we may kill fome Alcamles (a fowl like our
Cidieus") for ourfelves, for I know he keeps the gun-
ner's (tores in the fhip? Yes, fays he, I'll bring iome,
and accordingly he brought a great leather pouch
which held about a pound and a half of powder, or
rather more; and another with lot, that had five or
fix pounds, with fome bullets, and put all into the
boat: at the fame time I had found fome powder of
my master's in the great cabbin, with which I filled
one
one of the large bottles in the cafe, which was almost empty; pouring what was in it into another: and
thus furnished with every thing needful, we failed out
of the port to Mr. the castle, which is at the entrance
of the port knew who we were, and took no notice
of us; and we were not above a mile out of the port
before we haled in our fail, and fet us down to fifh:
the wind blew from the N. NE. which was contrary
to my defire; for had it blown southerly I had been
fure to have made the coaft of Spain,and at leaft
reached to the bay of Cadiz; but my refolutions were,
blow which way it would, I would be gone from
that horrid place where I was, and leave the reft
to fate.
After we had fished fome time and catched nothing,
for when I had fifh on my hook I would not pull
them up, that he might not fee them; T faid to the
Moor,this will not do, our master will not be thus
ferved, we muft ftand farther off: he thinking no
harm agreed, and being in the head of the boat fet
the fails; and as I had the helm I run the boat out
near a league farther, and then brought her too as if
I would fifh, when giving the boy the helm, I ftept
forward to where the Moor was, and making as if I
ftoopt for fomething behind him, I took him by fur-
prize with my arm under his twist, and toft him clear
overboard into the fea; he rofe immediately, for he
fwam like a cork, and called to me, begged to be
taken in, told me he would go all over the world with
me; he fwam fo ftrong after the boat that he would
have reached me very quickly, there being but little
wind; upon which I ftept into the cabbin, and fetch jng one of the fowling-pieces, I preferred it at him,
and
and told him, I had done him no hurt, and if he
would be quiet I would do him none : but, faid I, you
fwim well enough to reach to the more, and the fea is
calm, make the beft of your way to store, and I will
do you no harm, but if you come near the boat I'll
fhoot you through the head; for I am refolved to
have my liberty; fo he turned himfelf about and
fwam for the more, and I make no doubt but he
reached it with eafe, for he was an excellent
fwimmer.
I could have been content to have taken this Moor
with me, and have drowned the boy, but there was
no venturing to truft him: when he was gone
I turned to the boy, who they called Xury,
and faid to him, Xury, if you will be faithful to
me I'll make you a great man, but if you will
not stroke your face to be true to me, that is,
fwear by Mahomet and his father's beard, I muft
throw you into the fea too; the boy fmiled in my
face, and fpoke fo innocently that I could not mif-
trust him; and fwore to be faithful to me, and go all
over the world with me.
While I was in view of the Moor that was swim- ming, I stood out directly to fea with the boat, rather
stretching to windward, that they might think me
gone towards the Straits mouth (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits muft have been fuppofed
to do) for who would have fuppofed we were failed
on to the fouthward to the truly Barbarian coaft,
where whole nations of negroes were fare to fur-
round us with the canoes, and deftroy us; where
we could never once go on shore but we fhould be
devoured
devoured by favage beasts, or more merciless savages of human kind.
But as foon as it grew duflt in the evening, I
changed my courfe, and steered directly fouth and
by eaft, bending my courfe a little toward the east, that I might keep in with the more; and having a
fair fresh gale of wind, and a fmooth quiet fea, I
made such fail that I believe by the next day at three
o'clock in the afternoon, when 1 firft made the land,
I could not be lefs than 150 miles fouth of Sallee;
quite beyond the emperor cf Morcco's dominions, or
indeed of any other king thereabouts, for we faw no
people.
Yet fuch was the fright I had taken at the Moors,
and the dreadful apprehenfions I had of falling into
their hands, that I would not ftop, or go on more, or
come to an anchor; the wind continuing fair, 'till I
had failed in that manner five days: and then the
wind shifting to the fouthward, I concluded alfo that
if any of our veffels were in chace of me, they alfo
would now give over;' fo I ventured to make to the
coaft, and come to an anchor in the mouth of a little
river, I knew not what, or where; neither what lati-
tude, what country, what nation, or what river: I
neither faw, or defired to fee any people, the prin.r
cipal thing I wanted was frefh water. We came in-
to this creek in the evening, refolving to fwim on
fhore as foon as it was dark, and difcover the country;
but as foon as it was quite dark, we heard fuch
dreadful noifes of the barking, roaring, and howling
of wild creatures of we knew not what kinds, that the
poor boy was ready to die with fear, and begged of
me not to go on shore till day; well Xury, faid I,
then
then I won't, but it may be we may fee men by day,
who will be as bad to us as thofe lions ; then we givethem the Jhoot gun, fays Xury, laughing, make themrun wey; fuch Englijb Xury fpoke by converting
among us flaves. However I was glad to fee the boy
fo chearful, and I gave him a dram (out of our pa-
tron's cafe of bottles) to chear him up: after all, Xury's
advice was good, and I took it, we dropped our
little anchor and lay still all night; I fay flill, for we
ileptnone; for in two or three hours we faw vaft
great creatures (we knew not what to call them)
of many forts, come down to the fea-fhore and run
into the water, wallowing and warning themfelves
for the pleafure of cooling themfelves; and they
made fuch hideous howlings and yellings, that I
never indeed heard the like,
Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fo was
I too; but we were both more frighted when we heard one of thefe mighty creatures come fwimming
towards our boat; we could not fee him, but v.e
might hear him by his blowing to be a monftrous
huge and furious beast ; Xury faid it was a lion, and
it might be fo for ought I know; but poor Xury cried
to me to weigh the anchor and row away; no, fays I,
Xury, we can flip our cable with the buoy to it and
go off to fea, they cannot follow us far; I had no
fooner faid fo, but I perceived the creature (whatever
it was) within two oars length, which fomething fur-
prized me; however I immediately ftept to the cab-
bin-door, and taking up my gun fired at him, upon
which he immediately turned about, and swam towards the more again.
\ But
But it is hnpoffible to defcribe the horrible noises, and hideous cries and howlings, that were raifed,
as well upon the edge of the fhore, as higher within
the country, upon the noife or report of the gun, a.
thing I have fomc rcafon to believe thofe creatures
had never heard before; this convinced me that
there was no going on shore for us in the night upon
that coast, and how to venture on fhore in the day
was another question too; for to have fallen into the
hands of any of the favages, had been as bad as to
have fallen into the hands of lions and tygers; at
leaft we were equall y apprehenfive of the danger of it.
Be that as it would, we were obliged to go on
fhore fomewhere or other for water, for we had not
a pint left in the boat;, when or where to get to it
was the point: Xury fai'd, if I would let him go on
more with one of the jars, he would find if there
was any water and bring fome to me. I asked him
why he would go? why I fhould not go and he flay
in the boat; the boy anfwered with fo much affection that made me love him ever after. Says he, If wild
mam come, they sat me, you go wey. Well, Xury9
laid I, we will both go, and if the wild mans come,
we will kill them, they mail eat neither of us; fo I
gave Xury a. piece of rufk- bread to eat, and a dram
out of our patron's cafe of bottles which I mentioned
before; and we haled the boat in as near the shore as we thought was proper, 'and waded on shore ; car-
rying nothing but our arms, and two jarrs for water,
I did. not care to go out of fight of the boat, fear-
ing the: coming of canoes with Savages down the
river : but the bey feeing a low place about a mile
up the country, rambled to it; and by and by I faw
him
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. him come running towards me. I thought he purfued by fome favage, or frighted with fome \\ ild
beaft, and I run forward towards him to help hi m,
but when I came nearer to him, I faw fomethi'.ng
hanging over his shoulders, which was a creature that
he had met, like a hare, but different in colour, and longer legs, however we were very glad of it, and it
was very good meat; but the great joy that poor
Xary came with, was to tell me he had found good
water, and feen no wild mans.
But we found afterwards that we need not take fuch pains for water, for a little higher up the creek
where we were, we found the water fresh when the
tide was out, which flows but a little way up; io
we filled our jarrs and feasted on the hare we had
killed, and prepared to go on our way, having feen
no foot-fteps of any human creature in that part of
the country.
As I had been one voyage to this coaft before, I
knew very well that the iflands of the Canaries, and
ihcCaptdc Fm/iflands alfo, lay not far off from the
coast. But as I had no inftruments to take an ob-
fervation to know what latitude we were in, and not
exactly know, or at leaft to remember what latitude
they were in, I knew not where to look for them, or
when to ftand off to fea towards them; otherwife I
might now easily have found fome of thefe iflands.
But my hope was, that if I ftood along this-coaft till
I came to that part where the Englishtraced, I fhould
find fame of their veffels upon their ufual defign of
trade, that would relieve and take us in.
By the belt of my calculation, that place where
I now was, must be that country, which lying be-
tween
32 LIFE AND ADVENTUREStween the emperor of Morocco's dominions and the Negroes, lies waste, and uninhabited, except by wild
be;ifts; the Negroes having abandoned it, and gone
farther fouth for fear of the Moors; and the Moors
not thinking it worth inhabiting, by reafon of its
barrcnncfs; and indeed both forfaking it becaufe of
the prodigious numbers of tygers, lions, leopards,
and other furious creatures which harbour there.
fo that the Moors nfe it for their hunting only, where
they go like an army, two or three thoufand men at
a time; and indeed for near an hundred miles to-
gether upon this coast, we faw nothing but a wafte
uninhabited country by day; and heard nothing but
Lowlings and roaring of wild beaft by night.
Once or twice in the day time I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe, being the high top of the
mountain Tenerlffc in the Canaries; and had a great
» mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither ^
but having tried twice, I was forced in again by con-
trary winds, the fea alfo going too high for my little
veflel, fo I refolved to pursue my firft defign and keep
along the fhore.
Several times I was obliged to land for from water,
after we had left this place; and once in particular,
being early in the morning, we came to an anchor
under a little point of land which was pretty high,
and the tide beginning to flow, we lay ftill to go
farther in; Xury, whofe eyes were more about him than it feems mine were, calls foftly to me, and tells
me that we had belt go farther off the more; for,
fays he, look yonder lies a dreadful monster on the
fide of that hillock faft afleep: I looked where he
pointed, and faw a dreadful monster indeed, for it
was
was a terrible great lion that lay on the fide of the
fhore, under the made of a piece of the hill that hung
as it were a little over him. Xury, fays I, you fhall
go on fhore and kill him; Xury looked frighted, and
faid, Mekill! he eat me at one mouth; one mouthful
he meant; however, I faid no more to the boy, but
bad him lie still, and I took our biggeft gun, which
was almoft mufket-bore, and loaded it with a good
charge of powder, and with two flugs, and laid it
down; then I loaded another gun with two bullets
and the third, for we had three pieces, I loaded with
five fmaller bullets. I took the belt aim I could
with the firft piece to have met him into the head,
but he lay fo with his leg raifed a little above his
nofe, that the flags hit his leg about the knee, and
broke the bone. He started up growling at firft, but
finding his leg broke fell down again, and then got
up upon three legs, and gave the moft hideous roar
that ever I heard; I was a little furprifed that I had
not hit him on the head; however, I took up the fe-
cond piece immediately, and, though he began to
move off, fired again, and mot him into the head,
and had the pleafure to fee him drop, and make but
little noife, but lay ftruggling for life. Then Xury
took heart, and would have me let him go on fhore:
Well, go, faid I; fo the boy jumped into the water,
and taking a little gun in one hand, fwam to fhore
with the other hand, and coming clofe to the
creature, put the muzzel of the piece to his ear,
and let him into the head again, which difpatched
him quite.
This was game indeed to us, but this was no food;
and I was very forry to loofe three charges of powder
VOL. I. D and
and met upon a creature that was good for nothing to
us. However, Xury faid he would have fome of him;
fo he comes on board, and asked me to give him the
hatchet. For what,Xury? faid I. Me cut off'his bead,
faid he. However, Xury could not cut off his head,
but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and
it was a monftrous great one.
I bethought myfelf however, that perhaps the
fkin of him might one way or other be of fome value
to us; and I resolved to take off his fkin if I could.
So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury
was much the better workman at it, for I knew very
ill how to do it. Indeed it took us up both the whole
day, but at laft we got off the hide of him, and fpread-
ing it on the top of our cabin, the fun effectually
dried it in two days time, and it afterwards ferved me
to lie upon.
After this stop, we made on to the fouthward con-
tinually for ten or twelve days, living very fparing
on our provifions, which began to abate very much, and going no oftner into the more than we were
obliged to for frefh water; my defign in this was, to make the river Gambia or Senegal, that is to fay,
any where about the Capede Verde,where I was in
hopes to meet with fome European fhip; and if I did
not, I knew not what courfe I had to take, but to
feek for the Islands,or perifh there among the Ne-
groes. I knew that all the maps from Europe, which
failed either to the coaft of Guinea or to Rrofd, or to
the EastIndies, made this Cape, or thofe Islands; and
in a word, I put the whole of my fortune upon this
lingle point, either that I muf t meet with fome ihip»
or muft perifh.
When
When I had purfued this refolution about ten days
longer, as I have faid, I began to fee that the land
was inhabited; and in two or three places, as we
failed by, we faw people Hand upon the fhore to look
at us; we could alfo perceive they were quite black
and Stark naked. I was once inclined to have gone
on shore to them; but Xury was my better counfel-
lor, and faid to me, No go, no go; however, I hauled
in nearer the more that I.might talk to them, and I
found they run along the more by me a good way;
I obferved they had no weapons in their hands, ex-
cept one, who had a long flender ftick, which Xury
faid was a lance, and that they would throw them a
great way with good aim; fo I kept at a distance but talked with them by figns as well as I could; and
particularly made figns for fomething to eat; they
beckoned to me to ftop my boat, and they would
fetch me fome meat; upon this I lowered the top of
my fail, and lay by, and two of them ran up into the
country, and in lefs than half an hour came back,
and brought with them two pieces of dry flefh and
fome corn, fuch as is the produce of their country >
but we neither knew what the one nor the other was;
however, we were willing to accept it, but how to
come at it was our next difpute, for I was not for
venturing on lore to them, and they were as much
afraid of us; but they took a fafe way for us all, for
they brought it to the fhore and laid it down, and
went and flood a great way off till we fetched it on
board, and then came elofe to us again.
We made figns of thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends; but an opportunity
offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully;
D 2 for
for while we were lying by the' fhore, came two mighty creatures, one purfuing the other (as we
took it) with great fury, from the mountains towards
the fea; whether it was the male purfuing the fe-
male, or whether they were in fport or in rage, we
could not tell, any more than we could tell whether
it was ufual or strange, but I believe it was the latter;
becaufe, in the rirft place, thofe ravenous creatures
feldom appear but in the night; and in the fecond
place, we found the people terribly frighted, efpe-
cially the women. The man that had the lance or
dart did not fly from them, but the reft did; how-
ever, as the two creatures ran directly into the water,
they did not feem to offer to fall upon any of the
Negroes, but plunged themfelves into the fea and
fwam about as if they had come for their diversion. At laft one of them began to come nearer our boat
than at firft I expected, but I lay ready for him, for
I had loaded my gun with all poffible expedition,.
and bad Xury load both the others; as foon as he
came fairly within my reach, I fired, and met him
directly into the head; immediately he funk down
into the water, but rofe inftantly and plunged up and
down as if he was ftruggling for life; and fo indeed
he was; he immediately made to the more, but
between the wound, which was his mortal hurt, and
the strangling of the water, he died just before he
reached the fhore.
It is impoilible to exprefs the aflonifhment of
thefe poor creatures at the noife and the fire of my
gun; some of them were even ready to die for fear,
and fell down as dead with the very terror. But
when they faw the creature dead, and funk in the
water,
•water, and that I made figns to them to come to the
shore, they took heart and came to the fhore, and
began to fearch for the creature. I found him by
his blood ftaining the water, and by the help of a
rope, which I flung round him, and gave the Negroes
to haul, they dragged him on shore, and found that
it was a moft curious leopard, fpotted and fine to an
admirable degree, and the Negroes held up their
hands with admiration to think what it was I had
killed him with.
The other creature, frighted with the flafh of fire
and the noife of the gun, fwam on lore, and ran up
directly to the mountains from whence they came,
nor could I at that distance know what it was. I
found quickly the Negroes were for eating the flesh of this creature, fo I was willing to have them take
it as a favour from me, which when I made figns to
them that they might take him, they were very -
thankful for; immediately they fell to work with
him, and though they had no knife, yet with a
fharpened piece of wood they took off his fkin as
readily, and much more readily, than we could have
dene with a knife; they offered me fome of the flesh, which I declined, making as if I would give it them,
but made figns for the skin, which they gave me
very freely, and brought me a great deal more of
their provision, which though I did not undcrftand,
yet I accepted; then I made figns to them for fome
water, and held out one of my jars to them,
turning it.bottom upward, to fhew that it was empty,
and that I wanted to have it filled. They called
immediately to fome of their friends, and there came
two women and brought a great veflel made of
D earth
earth, and burnt, as I fuppofe, in the fun; this
they fet down for me, as before, and I fent Xury
on fhore with my jars, and filled them all three.
The women were as ftark naked as the men.
I was now furnifhed with roots and corn, fuch as
it was, and water; and, leaving my friendly Negroes,
I made forward for about eleven days more, without
offering to go near the more, till I faw the land run
out a great length into the fea, at about the distance of four or five leagues before me; and, the fea being
very calm, I kept a large offing to make this point;
at length, doubling the point at about two leagues
from the land, I faw plainly land on the other fide
to feaward; then I concluded, as it was moft certain
indeed, that this was the Cape dc Verd, and thofe
the islands,called from thence Cape de VerdeIslands.However, they were at a great diftance, and I could
not well tell what I had belt to do, for if I should be taken with a frefh of wind I might neither reach
one nor the other.
In this dilemma, as I was very penfive, I ftept into
the cabin and fat me down, Xury having the helm,
. when on a fudden the boy cried out, Master,majler
a Chipwith a fail! and the foolifh boy was frighted
out of his wits, thinking it muft needs be fome of his
mafter's mips fent to purfue us, when I knew we
were gotten far enough out of their reach. I jumped
out of the cabin, and immediately faw not only the
ship, but what fhe was, (viz.) that it was a
Portuguesefhip, and, as I thought, was bound to the
coaft of Guineafor Negroes. But when I obferved
the courfe me fteered, I was foon convinced they
were bound fome other way, and did not defign to
come
come any nearer to the shore ; upon which I stretched out to fea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with
them if possible. With ail the fail I could make, I found I would not be able to come in their way, but that they would
be gone by before I could make any fignal to them;
but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to
defpair, they, it feems, faw me by the help of their
perfpective-glaffes, and that it was fome European
boat, which, as they fuppofed, muft belong to fome
ihip that was loft, fo they mortened fail to let me
come up. I was encouraged with this, and as I had
my patron's ancient on board, I made a waft of it to
them for a fignal of diftrefs, and iired a gun, both
which they faw, for they told me they faw the
fmoke, though they did not hear the gun; upon-
thefe fignals they very kindly brought-to, and
lay-by for me, and in about three hours time I came
up with them.
They asked me what I was, in Portuguese,and in
Spanish,and in French; but I understood none of
them; but at laft a Scots failor, who was on board,
called to me, and I anfwered him, and told him I
was an Englishman,that I had made my efcape out
of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in,
and all my goods.
It was an inexpreffible joy to me, that anyone would
believe that I was thus delivered, as I e (teemed it,
from fuch a miferable and almoft hopelefs condition
as I was in, and immediately offered all I had to the
captain of the fhip, as a return for my deliverance;
but he generoufly told me, he would take nothing
D 4 from
from me, but that all I had fhould be delivered fafe
to me when I came to the Brafils; for, fays he, I have savedyour life on no other terms than I would be
glad to befaved myfelf; and it may one time or other be
my lot to be taken up in the fame condition; bcfides, faid
he, when I carry you to the Brafils, fo great a way
from your own country, if I shouldtake from you what
you have, you will be flawed there, and then I only
take away that life I have given. No, no, Seignor
Inglefe, fays he, Mr. Englishman, I will carry you
thither in charity, and thosethings will help you to buy
yourfubjiftence there, and your pajfagc home again.
As he was charitable in his propofal, fo he was
juft in the performance to a tittle, for he ordered the
feamen, that none would offer to touch any thing I
had; then he took every thing into his own posses fion, and gave me back an exact inventory of them,
that I might have them; even fo much as my three
earthen jars.
As to my boat, it was a very good one, and that he
faw, and told me he would buy it of me for the fhip's
ufe, and asked me what I would have for it? I told
, him, he had been fo generous to me in every thing,
that I could not offer to make any price of the boat,
but left it entirely to him ; upon which he told me he
would give me a note of his hand to pay me 80 pieces
of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if
• any one offered to give more, he would make it up;
he offered me alfo 60 pieces of eight more for my
boy Xiiry, which I was loath to take, not that I was
not willing to let the captain have him, but I was
very loath to fell the poor boy's liberty, who had
affifted me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How-
ever,
ever, when I let him know my reafon, he owned it to
be juft, and offered me this medium, that he would
give the boy an obligation to fet him free in ten years,
if he turned Chriftian ; upon this, and Xtiry faying he
was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.
We had a very good voyage to the Bra/ils, and
arrived in the Bay de Todos los Santos,or All-Saints-
Bay, in about twenty-two days after. And now I
was once more delivered from the mof t miferable of
all conditions of life, and what to do next with myfelf
I was now to confider.
The generous treatment the captain gave me, I can
never enough remember; he would take nothing of
me for my paflage, gave me twenty ducats for the
leopard's fkin, and forty for the lion's skin which I
had in my boat, and caufed every thing I had in the
ship to be punctually delivered me; and what I was
willing to fell he bought, fuch as the cafe of bottles,
two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of bees-wax,
for I had made candles of the reft; in a word, I
made about 220 pieces of eight of all my cargo, and
with this ftock I went on more in the Brafils.
I had not been long here, but being recommended
to the houfe of a good honeft man like himfelf, who
had an Ingelno as they call it; that is, a plantation
and a fugar-houfe, I lived with him fome time, and
acquainted myfelf by that means with the manner of
their planting and making of fugar; and feeing how
well the planters lived, and how they grew rich
fuddenly, I refolved, if I could get licenfe to
fettle there, I would turn planter among them,
refolving in the mean time to find out fome way
to get my money, which I had left in London,
remitted
remitted to me." To this purpose, getting a kind of a.
letter of naturalization, I purchased at; much land
that was uncured as my money would reach, and
formed a plan for my plantation and fcttlement, and
fuch a one as might be fuitablc to the flock which I propofcd to myfclf to receive from England.
I had a neighbour, a Portuguese of Lisbon,but
born of Englishparents, whofe name was We/is, and
in much fuch circumftances as I was. I call him
neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine,
and we went on very fociable together. My flock was but low, as well as his: and we rather planted
for food, than any thing elfe, for about two years.
However, we began to incrcafe, and our land began
to come into order; fo that the third year we planted
fome tobacco, and made each of us a large piece of
ground ready for planting canes in the year to come;
but we both wanted help; and now I found, more
than before, I had done wrong in parting with my
boy Xury.
But alas! for me to do wrong, that never did
right, was no great wonder: I had no remedy but to
go on; I was gotten into an employment quite
remote to my genius, and directly contrary to the life
I delighted in, and for which I forfook my father's
houfe, and broke through all his good advice; nay,
I was coming into the very middle flation, or upper
degree of low life, which my father advifed me to
before; and which if I refolved to go on with, I
might as well have Raid at home, and never have
fatigued myfelf in the world as I had done; and I
ufed often to fay to myfelf, I could have done this as
well in England among my friends, as have gone
SOOQ
5000 miles off to do it, among fhangers and favages
in a wildernefs, and at fuch diflance, as never to hear
from any part of the world that had the leaft know-
ledge of me.
In this manner I ufed to look upon my condition
with the utmoft regret. I had nobody to converfe
with, but now and then this neighbour; no work
to be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I
ufed to fay, I lived juft like a man caft away upon
fome dcfolate ifland, that had nobody there but
himfelf. But how just has it been, and how fhould
all men reflect, that, when they compare their pre-
fent conditions with others that are worfe, heaven
may oblige them to make the exchange, and be
convinced of their former felicity, by their experi-
ence: I fay, how just has it been, that the truly foli-
tary life I reflected on in an ifland of mere defoliation
mould be my lot, who had fo often unjustly compared
it with the life which I then led, in which had I
continued, I had in all probability been exceeding
profperous and rich.
I was in fome degree fettled in my meafures for car-
rying on the plantation, before my kind friend the
captain of the ship', that took me up at fea, went
back; for the fhip remained there, in providing his
loading, and preparing for his voyage, near three
months; when, telling him what little ftock I had left
behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and
fincere advice: Seignor Inglcfe, fays he, for fo he
always called me, if you will give me letters, and a
procuration here in form to me, with orders to the
person who has your money in London, to fend your
effects to Lifoon, to fuch perfons as I mail direct, and
in
in fuch goods as are proper for this country, I will bring you the produce of them, God willing, at my
return; but fmce human affairs are all subject to*
changes and dilafcers, I would have you give orders
but for one hundred poundsy&r//;/£, which you fay is
half your stock, and let the hazard be run for the
f.rft; fo that if it come fafe, you may order the reft
the fame way; and if it miscarry y, you may have the
other half to have recourfe to for your fupply.
This was fo wholesome advice, and looked fo
friendly, that I could not but be convinced it was the
belt courfe I could take; fo I accordingly prepared
letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my
money, and a procuration to the Portuguesecaptain,
as he desired. I wrote the Englishcaptain's widow a full account
of all my adventures, my flavery, efcape, and how
I had met with the Portugal captain at fea, the huma-
nity of his behaviour, and what condition I was
now in, with all other necefiary diredtions for my
fupply; and when this honeft captain came to Liam,he found means, by force of the Englishmerchants
there, to fend over, not the order only, but a full
account of my ftory, to a merchant at London, who
reprefented it effectually to her; whereupon, me not
only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket
fent the Portugal captain a very handfome prefent for
his humanity and charity to me.
The merchant in London vesting this hundred
pounds in Englishgoods, fuch as the captain had
writ for, fent them directly to him at Lisbon,and he
brought them all fafe to me to the Brafils, among
which, without my direction (for I was too young
in,
in my bufinefs to think of them), he had taken care
to have all fort of tools, iron-work, and utenfils
necessary for my plantation, and which were of great
ufe to me.
When this cargo arrived, I thought my fortune
made, for I was furprifed with joy of. it; and my
good fteward the captain had laid out the five pounds
which my friend had feat him for a prefent for him-
felf, to purchafe, and bring me over a servant under
bond for fix years fervice, and would not accept of
any confideration, except a little tobacco, which I
would have him accept, being of my own produce.
Neither was this all; but my goods being all
Englishmanufactures, fuch as cloth, ftuffs, baize,
and things particularly valuable and defirable in the
country, I found means to fell them to a very great
advantage; fo that I may fay, I had more than four
times the value of my firft cargo, and was now infi-
nitely beyond my poor neighbour, I mean in the
advancement of my plantation; for the firft thing I
did, I bought me a Negro flave, and an European
fervant alfo; I mean another befides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.But as abufed profperity is oftentimes made the
very means of our greateft adverfity, fo was it with
me. I went on the next year with great fuccefs in my
plantation: I raifed fifty great rolls of tobacco on
my own ground, more than I had difpofed of for ne-
ceflaries among my neighbours; and thefe fifty
rolls, being each of above 100 ivt. were well cured
and laid by againft the return of the fleet from Lisbon:And now, increafing in bufinefs and in wealth, my
head began to be full of projects and undertakings
bevond
beyond my reach; fuch as are indeed often the ruin
of the belt heads in burmcfs.
Had I continued in the fiat ion I was now in, I had
room for all the happy things to have yet befallen
me, for which my father fo earneftly recommended a
quiet retired life, and of which he had fo fenfibly
defcribed the middle station of life to be full; but
other things attended me, and I was ftill to be the
wilful agent of all my own mifcrics ; and particularly
to increafe my fault, and double the reflections upon
myfelf, which in my future forrows I would have
leifure to make; all thefe mifcarriages were procured
by my apparent obftinate adhering to my foolifh in-
clination of wandering abroad, and purfuing that
inclination, in contradiction to the cleareit views of
doing myfelf good in a fair and plain purfuit of thofe
prospects and thofe meafures of life, which nature
and providence concurred to prefent me with, and to
make my duty.
As I had done thus in my breaking away from my
parents, fo I could not be content now, but I muft
go and leave the happy view I had of being a rich
and thriving man in my new plantation, only to purfue
a rafh and immoderate defire of rifmg fafter than the
nature of the thing admitted; and thus I caft myfelf.
down again into the deepeft gulph of human mifery
that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be confif-
tent with life and a ftate of health in the world.
To come then by the juft degrees to the particulars
of this part of my ftory; you may fuppofe, that hav-
ing now lived almcfr four years in the Brass,and
beginning to thrive and profper very well upon my
plantation, I had not only learned the language, but
had
had contracted acquaintance and friendfhip among
my fellow-planters, as well as among the merchants
at St. Salvadore, which was our port; and that in
my difcourfe among them, I had frequently given
them an account of my two voyages to the coast of
Guinea, the manner of trading with the Negroes there,
and how eafy it was to purchafe upon the coast, for
trifles, fuch as beads, toys, knives, fciflars, hatchets,
bits of glafs, and the like, not only gold duft,
Guinea grains, elephants teeth, &c. but Negroes for
the fervice of the Bra/its, in great numbers.
They listened always very attentively to my dif-
courfes on thefe heads, but efpecially to that part
which related to the buying Negroes, which was a
trade at that time not only not far entered into,
but as far as it was, had been carried on by the
Affiento's, or permission of the kings of Spain and
Portugal, and engrossed in the public, fo that few
Negroes were brought, and thofe exceflive dean It happened, being in company with fome mer-
chants and planters of my acquaintance, and talking
of thofe things very earneftly, three of them came to
me the next morning, and told me they had been
mufing very much upon what I had difcourfed with
them of, the laft night, and they came to make a
fecret propofal to me; and after enjoining mefecrecy,
they told me, that they had a mind to fit out a fhip
to go to Guinea; that they had all plantations as well
as I, and were ftraitened for nothing fo much as fer-
vants; that as it was a trade could not be carried on, becaufe they could not publicly fell the Negroes when
they came home, fo they desired to make but one
voyage, to bring the Negroes on fhore privately, and
divide
divide them among their own plantations; and in a
word, the queftion was, whether I would go their
fuper-cargo in the fhip, to manage the trading part
upon the coaft of Guinea? and they offered me that
I should have my equal share of the Negroes, without
providing any par t of the Rock.
This was a fair propolal, it mufl be conferred, had
it been made to any one that had not had a settle- ment and plantation of his own to look after, which
was in a fair way of coming to be very confiderablc,
and with a good flock upon it. But for me, that was
thus entered and eflablifhed, and had nothing to do
but go on as I had begun, for three or four years more,
and to have fent for the other hundred pounds from
England, and who in that time, and with that little
addition, could fcarce have failed of being worth
three or four thoufand pounds fterling, and that in creasing too; for me to think of fuch a voyage, was
the moft prepofterous thing that ever man in fuch
eircumflances could be guilty of.
But I, that was born to be my own deflroyer,coulcl
no more refift the offer, than I could reftrain my first rambling defigns, when my father's good counfel
was loft upon me. In a word, I told them I would
go with all my heart, if they would undertake to look
after my plantation in my abfence, and would dif-
pofe of it to fuch as I would direct if I mifcarried.
This they all engaged to do, and entered into writ-
ings or covenants to do fo ; and I made a formal will,
difpofing of my plantation and effect, in cafe of my
death, making the captain of the fhip that had faved
my life as before, my univerfal heir, but obliging
him to difpofe of my effects as I had directed in my
will,
will, one half of the produce being to himfelf, and
the other to be fhipped to England.
In fhort, I took all poffible caution to preferve my
effects, and keep up my plantation; had I ufed half
as much prudence to have looked into my own
interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought
to have done, and not to have done, I had certainly
never gone away from fo profperous an undertaking,
leaving all the probable views of a thriving circum-
ftance, and gone upon a voyage to fea, attended
with all its common hazards; to fay nothing of the
reafons I had to expect particular misfortunes to
myself. But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the
dictates of my fancy rather than my reafon: and
accordingly the fhip being fitted out, and the cargo
furnished, and all things done as by agreement by
my partners in the voyage, I went on board in an evil
hour, the th of , being the fame day
eight years that I went from my father and mother at
Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and
the fool to my own intereft.
Our fhip was about 120 tun burthen, carried 6
guns, and 14 men, befides the matter, his boy, and
myfelf; we had on board no large cargo of goods,
except of fuch toys as were fit for our trade with the
negroes, fuch as beads, bits of glafs, fhells, and odd
trifles, efpecially little looking-glaffes, knives,
fciffars, hatchets, and the like.
The fame day I went on board we fet fail,
Handing away to the northward upon our own coaft,
with defign to stretch over for the African coaft,
when they came about iq or 12 degrees of northern
VOL. I. x E latitude,
latitude, which it feems was the manner of their
courfe in thofe days. We had very good weather,
only excessive hot, all the way upon our own coaft,
till we came the height of Cape St. Augitftino, from
whence keeping farther off at fea we loft fight of
land, and fteered as if we were bound for the ifle
Fernand dc Noronha, holding our courfe N. E. by A7",
and leaving thofe rifles on the eaft; in this courfe we
pair the line in about 12 days time, and were by our
laft obfervation in 7 degrees 22 min. northern
latitude, when a violent tournado or hurricane took
us quite out of our knowledge; it began from the
ibuth-eaft, came about to the north-weft, and then
fettled into the north-eaft, from whence it blew in
fuch a terrible manner, that for 12 days together
we could do nothing but drive; and fcudding away
before it, let it carry us whither ever fate and the
fury of the winds directed; and during thefe 12
days, I need not fay that I expected every day to
be fwallowed up, nor indeed did any in the fhip
expect to fave their lives.
In this diftrefs, we had, besides the terror of the
storm, one of our men died of the calenture, and
one man and the boy wafhed overboard ; about the
12th day the weather abating a little, the master made an obfervation as well as he could, and found
that he was in about 11 degrees north latitude, but
that he was 22 degrees of longitude difference weft
from Cape Si. Augujiino; fo that he found he was
gotten upon the coast of Guinea, or the "north part of
Brafily beyond the river Amozones, toward that of
the river Oronoqicc, commonly called the Great River,,
and began to confult with me what courfe he fcould
take, OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. sttake, for the fhip was leaky and very much
disabled, and he was going directly back to the
coaft of Brafil,
I was pofitively against that, and looking over the
charts of the fea-coafts of America with him, we
concluded there was no inhabited country for us to
have recourfe to, till we came within the circle of the
Caribbee-ijlands, and therefore refolved to fland
away for Barbadoes, which by keeping off at fea, to
avoid the indraft of the bay or gulph of Mexico, we
might eafily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen
days fail; whereas we could not poffibly make our
voyage to the coaft of Africa without fome affiftance,
both to our ship and to ourfelves.
With this defign we changed our courfe, and
fteered away N. W. by W. in order to reach fome of
our Englishiflands, where I hoped for relief; but
our voyage was otherwife determined; for being in
the latitude of 12 deg. 18 min. a fecond florm came
upon us, which carried us away with the fame
impetuofity weftward, and drove us fo out of the
very way of all human commerce, that had all bur
lives been faved, as to the fea, we were rather in
danger of being devoured by favages than ever
returning to our own country.
In this diftrefs, the wind ftill blowing very hard,
one of our men early in the morning cried out,
Land! and we had no fooner run out of the cabin
to look out in hopes of feeing whereabouts in the
world we were, but the fhip ftruck upon a fand,
and in a moment, her motion being fo stopped, the fea
broke over her in fuch a manner, that we expected
we should all have perifhed immediately, and we
E 2 were
were immediately driven into our clofe quarters
to fhcker lis from the very foam and fprye of
the fea.
It is not eafy for any one, who has not been in
the like condition, to defcribe or conceive the
confirmation of men in fuch circumftances; we
knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it
was we were driven, whether an ifland or the main,
whether inhabited or not inhabited; and as the
rage of the wind was full great, though rather lefs
than at first, we could not fo much as hope to have
the fhip hold many minutes without breaking in
pieces, unlefs the winds by a kind of miracle fhould
turn immediately about. In a word, •fce fat looking
one upon another, and expecting death every moment,
and every man acting accordingly, as preparing for
another world, for there was little or nothing more
for us to do in this; that which was our prefent
comfort, and all the comfort we had, was, that
contrary to our expectation the fhip did not break
yet, and that the mafter faid the wind began to
abate.
Now though we thought that the wind did a little
abate, yet the fhip having thus ftruck upon the fand,
and fticking too faft for us to expect her getting off,
we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had
nothing to do but to think of faving our lives as well
as we could; we had a boat at our stern, just before
the ftorm, but fhe was first staved by dashing againft
the ship's rudder, and in the next place fhe broke
away, and either funk or was driven off to fea, fo
there was no hope from her; we had another boat
on board, but how to get her off into the fea was a
doubtful
doubtful thing; however, there was no room to
debate, for we fancied the fhip would break in pieces
every minute, and fome told us fhe was actually
broken already.
In this diftrefs, the mate of our vessel lays hold of
the boat, and with the help of the reft of the men,
they got her flung over the fhip's-fide, and getting
all into her, let go, and committed ourfelves being
eleven in number, to God's mercy, and the wild
fea; for though the storm was abated confiderably?
yet the fea went dreadful high upon the more, and
might well be called, den wild zee, as the Dutch call
the fea in a ftorm.
And now our cafe was very difinal indeed; for
we all faw plainly, that the fea went fo high, that
the boat could not live, and that we would be
inevitably drowned. As to making fail, we had
none, nor, if we had, could we have done any thing
with it; fo we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to
execution; for we all knew, that when the boat
came nearer the lore, fhe would be dashed in a
thoufand pieces by the breach of the fea. However,
we committed our fouls to God in the moft earnest manner, and the wind driving us towards the more,
we hastened our deftru&ion with our own hands,
pulling as well as we could towards land.
What the more was, whether rock or fand,
whether fteep or meal, we knew not; the only
hope that could rationally give us the leaft fhadow
of expectation, was, if we might happen into fome
bay or gulph, or the mouth of fome river, where
by great chance we might have run our boat in, or
E 3' got
got under the lee of the land, and perhaps made
fmooth water. But there was nothing of this
appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the
fhore, the land looked more frightful than the fea.
After we had rowed, or rather driven about a
league and a half, as we reckoned it, a raging wave,
mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and
plainly bad us expect the coup-de-grace. In a word,
it took us with fuch a fury, that it overfet the boat
at once; and feparating us as well from the boat,
as from one other, gave us not time hardly to
fay, O God ! for we were all fwallowed up in a
moment.
Nothing can defcribe the confufion of thought
which I felt when I funk into the water; for though
I fwam very well, yet I could not deliver myfelf from
the waves fo as to draw breath, till that wave having
driven me, or rather carried me a vaft way on towards
the more, and having fpent itfelf, went back, and
left me upon the land almost dry, but half dead with
the water I took in. I had fo much prefence of mind
as well as breath left, that feeing myfelf nearer the
main land than I expected, I got upon my feet, and
endeavoured to make on towards the land as fart as
I could, before another wave would return, and take
me up again. But I foon found it was impoffible
to avoid it; for I faw the fea come after me as high
as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy which I
had no means or ftrength to contend with; my
bufmefswas to hold my breath, and rife myfelf Upon
the water, if I could: and fo by fwimming to
preferve my breathing, and pilot myfelf towards the
shore, if possible 5 my greatest concern now being,
that
that the fea, as it would carry me a great way
towards the fhore when it came on, might not
carry me back again with it when it gave back
towards the fea.
The wave that came upon me again, buried me
at once 20 or 30 foot deep in its own body; and I
could feel myself carried with a mighty force and
fwiftnefs towards the more a very great way; but
I held my breath, and affifted myfelf to fwim ftill
forward with all my might. I was ready to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myfelf
rifing up, fo to my immediate relief, I found my
head and hands moot out above the furface of the
water; and though it was not two feconds of time
that I could keep myfelf fo, yet it relieved me
greatly, gave me breath and new courage. I was
•covered again with water a good while, but not fo
long but I held it out; and finding the water had
spent itself, and began to return, I ftruck forward
against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I flood ftill a few moments to
recover breath, and till the water went from me,
and then took to my heels, and run with what
fhength I had farther towards the fhore. But
neither would this deliver me from the fury of the
fea, which came pouring in after me again, and
twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried
forwards as before, the fhore being very flat.
The laft time of thefe two had well near been
fatal to me; for the fea having hurried me along as
before, landed me, or rather darned me againft a
piece of a rock, and that with fuch force, as it
left me fenfelefs, and indeed helplefs, as to my own
E 4 deliverance;
deliverance; for the blow taking my fide and breaft,
beat the breath as it were quite out of my body;
and had it returned again immediately, I muft have
been ftrangled in the water; but I recovered a little
before the return of the waves, and feeing I would be
covered again with the water, I refolved to hold faft
by a piece of the rock, and fo to hold my breath, if
poffible, till the wave went back; now as the waves
were not fo high as at firft, being near land, I held
my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched
another run, which brought me fo near the more,
that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did
not fo fwallow me up as to carry me away, and the
next run I took I got to the main land, where,
to my great comfort, I clambered up the clifts
of the more, and fat me down upon the grafs, free
from danger, and quite out of the reach of the water,
I was now landed, and fafe on more, and began
to look up and thank God that my life was faved in
a cafe wherein there was fome minutes before fcarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to
exprefs to the life what the extafies and tranfports of
the foul are, when it is fo faved, as I may fay, out
of the very grave; and I do not wonder now at
that custom, viz. that when a malefactor, who
has the halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought
to him: I fay, I do not wonder that they bring a
furgeon with it, to let him blood that very mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the furprize may not
drive the animal fpirits from the heart, and over-
whelm him:
For suddenjoys, like griefs, confound atfirst,I walked

I* i.
I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands
and my whole being, as I may fay, wrapt up in the
contemplation of my deliverance, making a thoufand
geftures and motions which I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my comerades that were drowned,
and that there would not be one foul faved but
myfelf; for, as for them, I never faw them after,
wards, or any fign of them, except three of their
hats, one cap, and two fhoes that were not fellows.
I caft my eyes to the fttanded veffel, when the
breach and froth of the fea being fo big, I could
hardly fee it, it lay fo far off, and confidered, Lord!
how was it possible I could get on more!
After I had folaced my mind with the comfortable
part of my condition, I began to look round me, to
fee what kind of place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I foon found my comforts abate,
and that in a word I had a dreadful deliverance:
for I was wet, had no cloaths to shift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither
did I fee any prospect before me, but that of perifhing
with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts ; and
that which was particularly afflicting to me, was,
that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any
creature for my sustenance, or to defend myfelf
against any other creature that might defire to kill me for theirs: in a word, I had nothing about me
but a knife, a tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in
a box; this was all my provifion, and this threw
me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a
while I run about like a mad-man; night coming
upon me, I began with .a heavy heart to confmer
what would be my lot if there were any ravenous
beads
beads in that country, feeing at night they always
come abroad for their prey.
All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that
time, was, to get up into a thick bushy tree like a
fir, but thorny, which grew 'near me, and where
I refolved to fit all night, and confider the next day
what death I would die, for as yet I faw no prospect of life; I walked about a furlong from the fhore, to
fee if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I
did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a
little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger, I went
to the tree, and getting up into it, endeavoured to
place myfelf fo, as that if I would fleep I might not
fall; and having cut me a fhort ftick, like a
truncheon, for my defence, I took up my lodging,
and having been excessively fatigued, I fell faft afleep,
and flept as comfortably as, I believe, few could
have done in my condition, and found myfelf the
moft refrefhed with it that I think I ever was on fuch
an occafion.
When I waked it was broad day, the weather
clear, and the ftorm abated, fo that the fea did not
rage and fwell as before: but that which furprized
me most, was, that the fhip was lifted off in the
night from the fand where me lay, by the fwelling of
the tide, and was driven up almost as far as the rock
which I first mentioned, where I had been fo bruifed
by the dafhing me againf t it; this being within about
a mile from the fhore where I was, and the fhip
feeming to ftand upright ftill, I wifhed myfelf on board, that, at. leads, I might fave fome necessary things for my use. When I came down from my apartment in the
tree, I looked about me again, and the firft thing I
found
found was the boat, which lay as the wind and the fea
had toffed her up upon the land, about two miles on
my right hand, I walked as far as I could upon the
more to have got to her, but found a neck or inlet of
water between me and the boat, which was about
half a mile broad, fo I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting at the (ship, where I hoped to find something for my prefent
fubfiftence.
A little after noon I found the fea very calm, and
the tide ebbed fo far out, that I could come within a
quarter of a mile of the ship ; and here I found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I faw evidently, that if we
had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is to
lay, we had all got fafe on more, and I had not been
fo miferable as to be left entirely destitute of all com-
fort and company, as I now was ; this forced tears
from my eyes again, but as there was little relief in
that, I refolved, if pofTible, to get to the ship, fo I
pulled off my deaths, for the weather was hot to
extremity, and took the water; but when I came to
the fhip, my difficulty was ilill greater to know how
to get on board, for as me lay aground, and high
out of the water, there was nothing within my reach
to lay hold of. I fwam round her twice, and the
fecond time I fpied a finall piece of a rope, which
I wondered I did not fee at firft, hang down by the
fore-chains fo low as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help of that rope got up into
the forecaftle of the fhip; here I found that the fhip
was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold,
but that fhe lay fo on the fide of a bank of hard fand,
or rather earth, and her ftern lay lifted up upon the
il
bank, bank, and her head low almost to the water; by
this means all her quarter was free, and all that was
in that part was dry; for you may be fure my firft
work was to fearch and to fee what was fpoiled
and what was free; and first I found that all the
ship's provifions were dry and untouched by the
water; and being very well difpofed to eat, I
went to the bread-room and filled my pockets with
bifket, and eat it as I went about other things, for I
had no time to lofe. I alfo found fome rum in the
great cabin, of which I took a large dram, and
which I had indeed need enough of to fpirit me for
what was before me: Now I wanted nothing but a
boat to furnifh myfelf with many things which I fore-
w would be very neceffary to me.
It was in vain to fit ftill and wish for what was not
to be had, and this extremity rouzed my application;
we had feveral fpare yards, and two or three large
fparrs of wood, and a fpare topmast or two in the
ship ; I refolved to fall to work with thefe, and flung
as many of them over-board as I could manage of their
weight, tying every one with a rope that they might
not drive away; when this was done I went down
the ship's fide, and pulling them to me, I tied four
of them faft together at both ends as well as I could,
in the form of a raft, and laying two or three fhort
pieces of plank upon them crofs-ways, I found I could
walk upon it very well, but that it was not able to
bear any great weight, the pieces being too light;
fo I went to work, and with the carpenter's faw I
cut a fpare topmast into three lengths, and added
them to my raft, with a great deal of labour and
pains; but hope of furnifhing myfelf with neceffaries
encouraged
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE. Iencouraged me to go beyond what I fhould have been
able to have done upon another occafion.
My raft was now ftrong enough to bear any rea-
fonable weight; my next care was what to load it
with, and how to preferve what I laid upon it from
the furf of the fea; but I was not long confidering
this; I firft laid all the planks or boards upon it that
I could get, and having considered well what I most wanted, I firs got three of the feamen's chests, which
I had broken open and emptied, and lowered them
down upon my raft; the first of thefe I filled with
provifions, viz. bread, rice, three Dutch cheefes,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh, which we lived much
upon, and a little remainder of European corn which
had been laid by for fome fowls which we brought
to fea with us, but the fowls were killed; there had
been fome barley and wheat together, but, to my
great difappointment, I found afterwards that the
rats had eaten or fpoiled it all; as for liquors, I
found feveral cafes of bottles belonging to our fkipper,
in which were fome cordial waters, and in all above
five or fix gallons of rack, thefe I flowed by them-
felves, there being no need to put them into the chest, nor no room for them. While I was doing this, I
found the tide began to flow, though very calm, and I
had the mortification to fee my coat, shirt, and waist- coat, which I had left on more upon the fand, fwim
away; as for my breeches, which were only linen,
and open-knee'd, I fwam on board in them and my
blockings: however, this put me upon rummaging
for cloaths., of which I found enough, but took no
more than I wanted for prefent ufe, for I had other
things which my eye was more upon; as firft, tools to
work
work with on fhore, and it was after long fearching
that I found out the carpenter's cheft, which was
indeed a very ufeful prize to me, and much more
valuable than a fhip-loading of gold would have been
at that time; I got it down to my raft, even whole
as it was, without lofmg time to look into it, for I
knew in general what it contained.
My next care was for fome ammunition and arms;
there were two very good fowling-pieces in the great
cabin, and two pistols, thefe I fecured firfl, with
fome powder-horns, and a fmall bag of mot, and two
old crufty fwords: I knew there were three barrels of
powder in the fhip, but knew not where our gunner
had flowed them; but with much fearch I found
them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken
water ; thofe two I got to my raft, with the arms;
and now I thought myfelf pretty well freighted, and
began to think how I would get to more with them,
having neither fail, oar, or rudder, and the leaft
cap full of wind would have overfet all my navi-
gation.
I had three encouragements: i. A fmooth calm
fea: 2. The tide rifmg and fetting into the more:
3. What little wind there was blew me towards the
land; and thus, having found two or three broken
oars belonging to the boat, and befides the tools
which were in the chest, I found two faws, an axe,
and a hammer, and with this cargo I put to fear :
for a mile, or thereabouts, my raft went very well,
only that I found it drive a little diftant from the
place where I had landed before, by which I per-
ceived that there was fome indraft of the water, and
confequently I hoped to find fome creek or river
there,
there, which I might make ufe of as a port to get to
land with my cargo.
As I imagined, fo it was; there appeared before
me a little opening of the land, and I found a ftrong
current of the tide fet into it, fo I guided my raft as
well as I could to keep in the middle of the liream:
but here I had like to have fuffered a fecond fhip-
wreck, which, if I had, I think verily would have
broke my heart; for knowing nothing of the coast, my raft run a-ground at one end of it upon a fhoal,
and not being a-ground at the other end, it wanted
but a little that all my cargo had flipped off towards
that end that was a-float, and fo fallen into the
water: I did my utmoft, by fetting my back againft
the chests, to keep them in their places, but could
not thrust off the raft with all my ftrength, neither
durst I ftir from the pofture I was in, but holding up
the chefts with all my might, ftood in that manner
near half an hour, in which time the rising of the
water brought me a little more upon a level, and a
little after, the water ftill riling, my raft floated
again, and I thruft her off with the oar I had, into
the channel, and then driving up higher, I at length
found myfelf in the mouth of a little river, with
land on both fides, and a ftrong current or tide run-
ning up; I looked on both fides for a proper place
to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high up the river, hoping in time to fee fome
fhip at lea, and therefore refolved to place myfelf as
near the coast as I could.
At length I fpied a little cove on the right fhore of
the creek, to which with great pain and difficulty I
guided my raft, and at laft got fo near, as that,
reaching
reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her
directly in; but here I had like to have dipt all my
cargo in the fea again; for that more lying pretty
fteep, that is to fay sloping, there was no place to
land, but where one end of the float, if it run on
shore, would lie fo high, and the other sink lower as
before, that it would endanger my cargo again: all
that I could do, was to wait 'till the tide was at the
highest, keeping the raft with my oar like an anchor
to hold the fide of it fall to the more, near a flat piece
of ground, which I expected the water would flow
over ; and fo it did: as foon as I found water enough,
for my raft drew about a foot of water, I thrust her
on upon that flat piece of ground, and there faftened
or moored her by sticking my two broken oars into
the ground; one on one fide near one end, and one
on the other fide near the other end; and thus I lay
till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all
my cargo fafe on more.
My next work was to view the country, and feel: a
proper place for my habitation, and where to ftow my
goods, to fecure them from whatever might happen;
where I was I yet knew not; whether on the continent
cr 9n an ifland, whether inhabited, or not inhabited,
whether in danger of wild beafts or not: there was a
hill not above a mile from me, whichrofe up very fteep
and high, and which feemed to over-top fome other
hills which lavas in a ridge from it northward; I took
cut one of the fowling pieces, and one of the pistols, and an horn of powder, and thus armed I travelled
fordifcoveryuptothe top of that hill,where, after Ihad
with great labour and difficulty go to the top,^I faw
roy fates to my great affliction, viz. that I was in an
ifland
island environed every way with the fea, no land to
be feen, except fome rocks which lay a great way
off, and two finall iflands lefs than this, which lay
about three leagues to the weft.
I found alfo that the ifland I was in was barren,
and, as I faw good reafon to believe, uninhabited,
except by wild beafts, of whom however I faw none,
yet I faw abundance of fowls, but knew not their
kinds, neither when I killed them could I tell what
was fit for food, and what not; at my coming back,
I met at a great bird, which I faw fitting upon a tree
on the fide of a great wood, I believe it was the firft
gun that had been fired there fince the creation of the
world ; I had no fooner fired, but from all the parts of
the wood there arofe an innumerable number of fowls
of many forts, making a confufed fcreaming, and
crying every one according to his ufual note; but
not one of them of any kind that I knew: as for the
creature I killed, I took it to be a kind of a hawk, its
colour and beak refembling it, but had no talons or
claws more than common, its flour was carrion, and
fit for nothing.
Contented with this difcovery, I came back to my
raft, and fell to work to bring my cargo on more,
which took me up the reft of that day, and what to
do with myfelf at night I knew not, nor indeed where
to rest ; for I was afraid to lie down on the ground,
not knowing but fome wild beast might devour me,
though, as I afterwards found, there was really no
need for thofe fears.
However, as well as I could, I barricado'd myfelf
round with the chefts and boards that I had brought
on more, and made a kind of a hut for that night's
VOL. I. F lodging}
lodging; as for food, I yet faw not which way to
fupply myfelf, except that I had feen two or three
creatures like hares run out of the wood where I fhot
the fowl.
I now began to consider, that I might yet get a
great many things out of the fhip, which would be
useful to me, and particularly fome of the rigging,
and fails, and fuch other things as might come to
land, and I refolved to make another voyage on
board the veflel, if possible ; and as I knew that the
firft ftorm that blew muft neceflarily break her all in
pieces, I resolved to fet all other things apart, 'till I
got every thing out of the lip that I could get; then
I called a council, that is to fay, in my thoughts,
whether I should take back the raft, but this appeared
impracticable; fo I refolved to go as before, when
the tide was down, and I did fo, only that I ftripped
before I went from my hut, having nothing on but
a chequered shirt, and a pair of linen trowfers, and
a pair of pumps on my feet.
I got on board the fhip, as before, and prepared a fecond raft, and having had experience of the first, I
neither made this fo unweildy, nor loaded it fo hard,
but yet I brought away several things very useful to me; as firft, in the carpenter's ftores, I found two or
three bags full of nails andfpikes, a great fcrew-jack,
a dozen or two of hatchets, and above all, that most ufeful thing called a grind none ; all thefe I fecured
together, with feveral things belonging to the gun-
ner, particularly two or three iron crows, and two
barrels of mufquet-bullets, feven mufquets, and
another fowling-piece, with fome fmall quantity of
powder more; a large bag full of fmall fhot, and a
great
great roll of fheet lead: but this laft was fo heavy, I
could not hoist it up to get it over the (hip's fide.
Befides thefe things, I took all the men's deaths
that I could find, and a fpare fore-top-fail, hammock,
and fome bedding; and with this I loaded my fecond
raft, and brought them all fafe on more, to my very
great comfort.
I was under fome apprehenfions during my abfence
from the land, that at leaft my provifions might be
devoured on more; but when I came back, I found
no fign of any vifitor, only there fat a creature like a
wild cat upon one of the chefts, which when I came
towards it, ran away a little distance, and then ftood
ftill; me fat very compofed, and unconcerned, and
looked full in my face, as if me had a mind to be
acquainted with me; I prefented my gun at her, but
as me did not underftand it, fhe was perfectly
unconcerned at it, nor did me offer to ftir away;
upon which I tofled her a bit of bifcuit, though by the
way I was not very free of it, for my ftore was not
great : however, I fpared her a bit, I fay, and fhe
went to it, fmelled of it, and ate it, and looked, as
pleafed, for more, but I thanked her, and could
fpare no more; fo fhe marched off.
Having got my fecond cargo on more, though I
was fain to open the barrels of powder, and bring
them by parcels, for they were too heavy, being large casks, I went to work to make me a little tent
with the fail and fome poles which I cut for that
purpofe, and into this tent I brought every thing that
I knew would fpoil, either with rain or fun, and
I piled all the empty chefts and cafks up in a circle
F 2 round
round the tent, to fortify it from any fudden attempt,
either from man or bcaft.
When I had done this I blocked up the door of
the tent with fome boards within, and an empty
chefts fet up an end without, and fpreading one of
the beds upon the ground, laying my two piftols
just at my head, and my gun at length by me, I went
to bed for the first time, and slept very quietly all
night, for I was very weary and heavy, for the night
before I had slept little, and had laboured very hard
all day, as well to fetch all thofe things from the map, as to get them on more.
I had the biggest magazine of all kinds now that
ever were laid up, I believe, for one man; but I was
not fatisfied ftill; for while the fhip fat upright in
that pofture, I thought I ought to get every thing out
of her that I could; fo every day at low water I went
on board, and brought away fome thing or other:
but particularly the third time I went, I brought
away as much of the rigging as I could, as alfo all
the finall ropes and rope-twine I could get, with a
piece of fpare canvafs, which was to mend the fails
upon occafion, and the barrel of wet gun-powder: in
a word, I brought away all the fails first and laft, only
that I was fain to cut them in pieces, and bring as
much at a time as I could; for they were no more
ufeful to be fails, but as meer canvafs only.
But that which comforted me more ftill, was, that
at laft of all, after I had made five or fix fuch voyages
as thefe, and thought I had nothing more to expect from the map that was worth my meddling with; I fay,
after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, and
three
•' T77'' T ""' ' '1"'Y
*
three large runlets of rum or fpirits, and a box of
sugar, and a barrel of fine flower; this was furprizing
to me, becaufe I had given over expecting any more
provifions, except what was fpoil'd by the water: I
Toon emptied the hogshead of that bread, and wrapt
it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the fails, which
I cut out: and in a word, I got all this fafe on more
aw. The next day I made another voyage; and now,
having plundered the fhip of what was portable and
fit to hand out, I began with the cables; and cutting
the great cable into pieces, fuch as I could move, I
got two cables and a hawser on more, with all the
iron-work I could get; and having cut down the
fpritfail-yard, and the mizen-yard, and every thing I
could to make a large raft, I loaded it with all thofe
heavy goods, and came away: but my good luck
began now to leave me'; for this raft was fo unweildy,
and fo overladen, that after I was entered the little
cave, where I had landed the reft of my goods, not
being able to guide it fo handily as I did the other, it
overfet, and threw me and all my cargo into the
water ; as for myfelf it was no great harm, for I was
near the more; but as to my cargo, it was great part
of it loft, efpecially the iron, which I expected would
have been of great ufe to me: however, when the
tide was out, I got moft of the pieces of cable amore;
and fome of the iron, though with infinite labour;
for I was fain to dip for it into the water, a work
which fatigued me very much; after this, I went
every day on board, and brought away what I
could get.
F 3 I had
I had been now-13 days on shore, and had been
11 times on board the fhip; in which time I had
brought away all that one pair of hands could well be
fuppofed capable to bring, though I believe verily,
had the calm weather held, I would have brought
away the whole map, piece by piece: but preparing
the 12th time to go on board, I found the wind
began to rife ; however at low water I went on board,
and though I thought I had rummaged the cabin fo
effectually, as that nothing more could be found,
yet I difcovered a locker with drawers in it, in one
of which I found two or three razors, and one pair of
large fciffars, with fome ten or a dozen of good knives
and forks; in another I found about thirty fix pounds
value in money, fonie European coin, fome Brafit,
fome pieces of eight, fome gold, fome filver.
I fmiled to myfelf at the fight of this money. O
Drug! faid I, aloud, what art thou good for? thou
art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the
ground; one of thofe knives is worth all this heap; I
have no manner of ufe for thee, even remain where
thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whofe
life is not worth faving. However, upon fecond
thoughts, I took it away, and wrapping all tLis in a
piece of canvas, I began to think of making another
raft, but while I was preparing this, I found the fky
overcast, and the wind began to rife, and in a
quarter of an hour it blew a frefh gale from the more;
it prefently occurred to me, that it was in vain to pre-
tend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that
it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood
began, otherwife I might not be able to reach the
fhcre
fhore at all: accordingly I let myfelf down into the
•water, and fwam crofs the channel, which lay
between the fhip and the sands, and even that with
difficulty enough, partly with the weight of things I
had about me, and partly the roughnefs of the water,
for the wind rofe very haftily, and before it was quite
high water it blew a storm. But I was gotten home to my little tent, where I
lay with all my wealth about me very fecure. It blew
very hard all that night, and in the morning when I
looked out, behold no more fhip was to be feen; I was
a little furprized, but recovered myfelf with this
fatisfactory reflection, viz. That I had loft no time,
nor abated no diligence to get every thing out of her
that could be ufeful to me, and that indeed there was
little left in her that I was able to bring away, if I
had had more time.
I now gave over any more thoughts of the flap, or of any thing out of her, except what might drive
on more from her wreck, as indeed divers pieces of
her afterwards did; but thofe things were of finall
ufe to me.
My thoughts were now wholly employed about
securing myfelf againft either favages, if any mould
appear, or wild beasts, if any were in the ifland; and
I had many thoughts of the method how to do this,
and what kind of dwelling to make; whether I would make me a cave in the earth, or a tent upon the
earth: and, in short, I refolved upon both, the
manner and defcription of which it may not be im-
proper to give an account of.
1 foon found the place I was in was not for my
fettlement, particularly becaufe it was upon a low
F 4 moorifh
moorifh ground near the fea, and I believed would
not be wholefome, and more particularly becaufe
there was no frefh water near it, fo I refolved to find a more healthy and more convenient fpot of ground.
I confulted feveral things in my fituation which I
found would be proper for me, sit, Health, and
frefh water, I just now mentioned, adly, Shelter
from the heat of the fun. 3dly, Security from rave-
nous creatures, whether man orbeaft. 4thly, A view
to the fea, that if God fent any fhip in fight, I might
not lofe any advantage for my deliverance, of which
I was not willing to banifh all my expectation yet.
In fearch of a place proper for this, I found a little
plain on the fide of a rifmg hill, whofe front towards
this litttle plain was deep as a houfe-fide, fo that
nothing could come down upon me from the top; on
the fide of this rock there was a hollow place worn a
little way in like the entrance or door of a cave, but
there was not really any cave or way into the rock
at all.
On the flat of the green, juft before this hollow
place, I refolved to pitch my tent: this plain was not above an hundred yards broad, and about twice as
long, and lay like a green before my door, and at
the end of it defcended irregularly every way down
into the low grounds by the seaside. It was on the
N.N.W. fide of the hill, fo that I was fheltered from
the heat every day, till it came to a W. and by S. fun,
or thereabouts, which in thofe countries is near the
fetting.
Before I fet up my tent, I drew a half circle
before the hollow place, which took in about ten
yards in its femi-diameter from the rock, and
twenty
twenty yards in its diameter, from its beginning and
ending.
In this half circle I pitched two rows of strong ftakes, driving them into the ground till they flood
very firm, like piles, the biggest end being out of the
ground about five foot and a half, and fharpened on
the top; the two rows did not Hand above fix inches
from one another.
Then I took the pieces of cable which I had cut in
the fhip, and laid them in rows one upon another,
within the circle between thefe two rows offlakes, up
to the top, placing other stakes in the infide, leaning
against them, about two foot and a half high, like a
fpur to a poft, and this fence was fo strong, that
neither man or beaft could get into it or over it: this
coil me a great deal of time and labour, efpecially to
cut the piles in the woods, bring them to the place,
and drive them into the earth.
The entrance into this place I made to be not by a
door, but by a fhort ladder, to go over the top,
which ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after me,
and fo I was compleatly fenced in, and fortified, as
I thought, from all the world, and confequently flept
fecure in the night, which otherwife I could not have
done, though as it appeared afterward, there was no
need of all this caution from the enemies that I appre-
hended danger from.
Into this fence or fortrefs, with infinite labour,
I carried all my riches, all my provisions, ammu-
nition and flores, of which you have the account
above, and I made me a large tent, which, to preferve
me from the rains, that in one part of the year are
very violent there, I made double, viz. one finaller
tent
tent within, and one larger tent above it, and covered
the uppermoft with a large tarpaulin which I had
faved among the fails.
Andnow I lay no more for a while in the bed which
I had brought on more, but in a hammock, which
was indeed a very good one, and belonged to the
mate of the fhip.
Into this tent I brought all my provifions, and
every thing that would fpoil by the wet; and having
thus enclofed all my goods, I made up the entrance,
which till now I had left open, and fo paired and re-
paired, as I faid, by a fhort ladder.
When I had done this, I began to work my way
into the rock, and bringing all the earth and ftones
that I dug down, out through my tent, I laid them
up within my fence in the nature of a terras, that fo
it raifed the ground within about a foot and a half;
and thus I made me a cave juft behind my tent, which ferved me like a cellar to my houfe.
It colt me much labour, and many days, before
all thefe things were brought to perfection, and
therefore I must go back to fome other things which
took up fome of my thoughts. At the fame time it
happened, after I had laid my fcheme for the fetting up
my tent, and making the cave, that a storm of rain
falling from a thick dark cloud, a fudden flafh of
lightning happened, and after that a great clap of
thunder, as is naturally the effect of it; I was not fo
much furprized with the lightning, as I was with a
thought which darted into my mind as fwift as the
lightning itfelf: O my powder! my very heart funk
within me, when I thought, that at one blaft all my
powder might be destroyed : on which, not my
defence
defence only, but the providing me food, as I
thought, entirely depended; I was nothing near fo
anxious about my own danger; though had the
powder took fire, I had never known who had
hurt me.
Such impression did this make upon me, that after
the ftorm was over, I laid aside all my works, my
building, and fortifying, and applied myfelf to make
bags and boxes'to feparatethe powder, and to keep
it a little and a -little in a parcel, in hope, that what-
ever might come, it might not all take fire at once,
and to keep it fo apart, that it fhould not be possible to make one part fire another. I finifhed this work
in about a fortnight, and I think my powder, which in
all was about 240 pounds weight, was divided in not
lefs than a hundred parcels; as to the barrel that had
been wet, I did not apprehend any danger from that,
fo I placed it in my new cave, which in my fancy I
called my kitchen; and the reft I hid up and
down in holes among the rocks, fo that no wet
might *come to it, marking very carefully where I
laid it.
In the interval of time while this was doing, I
went out once at leaf t every day with my gun, as
well to divert myfelf, as to fee if I could kill any
thing fit for food, and as near as I could to acquaint
myfelf with what the island produced. The first time I went out I prefently difcovered that there
were goats in the ifland, which was a great fatisfaction
to me; but then it was attended with this misfortune
to me, viz,that they were fo fhy, fo fubtle, and fo
fwift of foot, that it was the uioft difficult thing in the
world to come at them: but I was not difcouraged
at
at this, not doubting but I might now and then moot
one, as it foon happened, for after I had found their
haunts a little, I laid wait in this manner for them:
I obferved, if they faw me in the valleys, though they
were upon the rocks, they would run away as in a
terrible fright; but if they were feeding in the
valleys, and I was upon the rocks, they took no
notice of me; from whence I concluded, that by the
pofition of their opticks, their fight was fo dire&ed
downward, that they did not readily fee objects that
were above them; fo afterward I took this method,
I always climbed the rocks fire, to get above them,
and then had frequently a fair mark. The firit shot I made among thcfe creatures, I killed a fhe-goat,
which had a little kid by her, which fhe gave fuck to,
which grieved me heartily; but when the old one
fell, the kid ftood flock ftill by her till I came and
took her up, and not only fo, but when I carried
the old one with me upon my moulders, the kid
followed me quite to my enclofure, upon which I
laid down the dam, and took the kid in my arms,
and carried it over my pale, in hopes to have bred
it up tame, but it would not eat, fo I was forced to
kill it and eat it my felt; thefe two fupplied me with
fleffi a great while, for I eat fparingly; and faved my
provifbns (my bread efpecially) as much as poffibly
I could.
Having now fixed my habitation, I found it
abfolutcly neceffary to provide a place to make a fire
in, and fewel to burn; and what I did for that, as
alfo how I enlarged my cave, and what conveniences
I made, I mall give a full account of in its place:
but I niuft firft give fome little account of myfelf, and
of
of my thoughts about living, which it may well be
fuppofed were not a few.
I had a difmal prospect of my condition; for as
I was not caft away upon that ifland without being
driven, as is faid, by a violent ftorm quite out of the
courfe of our intended voyage, and a great way, viz.
fome hundreds of leagues out of the ordinary courfe
of the trade of mankind, I had great reafon to
confider it as a determination of heaven, that in this
defolate place, and in this defolate manner I fhould
end my life; the tears would run plentifully down
my face when I made thefe reflections, and fometimes
I would expostulate with myfelf, why Providence
mould thus compleatly ruin his creatures, and render
them fo abfolutely mifcrable, fo without help
abandoned, fo entirely deprefied, that it could
hardly be rational to be thankful for fuch a life.
But fomething always returned fwift upon me to
check thefe thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly one day, walking with my gun in my
hand by the fea-fide, I was very penfive upon the
subject of my prefent condition, when reafon as
it were expoftulating with me to'ther way, thus:
Well, you are in a defolate condition, 'tis true, but
pray remember, where are the. reft of you? Did
not you come eleven of you into the boat? Where
are the ten? Why were they not faved and you loft?
Why were you singled out? Is it better to be here or
there? and then I pointed to the fea. All evils are
to be confidered with the good that is in them, and
with what worfe attended them.
Then it occurred to me again, how well I was
furnished for my fubfiftance, and what would have
been
been my cafe if it had not happened, which was an
hundred thoufand, to one, that the fhip floated from
the place where me firft struck, and was driven fo
near the more that I had time to get all thefe
things out of her: what would have been my cafe,
if I had been to have lived in the condition in which
I at firft came on fhore, without neceflaries of life,
or necessaries to fupply and procure them? particularly
faid I, aloud, (though to myfelf) what would I have
done without a gun, without ammunition, without
any tools to make any thing, or to work with; without
cloaths, bedding, a tent, or any manner of covering:
and that now I had all thefe to a fufficient quantity;
and was in a fair way to provide myfelf in fuch a
manner, as to live without my gun when my
ammunition was fpent; fo that I had a tolerable
view of fubfifting, without any want, as long as I
lived; for I confidered from the beginning how
I would provide for the accidents that might happen^
and.'for the time that was to come, even not only
after my ammunition would be fpent, but even after
my health or ftrength mould decay.
I confefs I had not entertained any notion of my
ammunition being destroyed at one blast, I mean my
powder being blown up by lightning, and this made
the thoughts of it fo furprifing to me when it
lightened and thundered, as I obferved juft now.
And now, being about to enter into a melancholy
relation of a fcene of filent life, fuch perhaps as was
never heard of in the world before, I mail take it from
itsbeginning, and continue it in itsorder. It was,bymy
account, the 3oth of September when, in the manner
as abovefaid, I first fet foot upon this horrid, island, 'when
when the fun being, to us, in its autumnal equinox,
was almoft just over my head, for I reckoned myfelf,
by obfervation, to be in the latitude of 9 degrees 22
minutes north of the line.
After I had been there about ten or twelve days,
it came into my thoughts, that I would lofe my
reckoning of time for want of books, and pen and
ink, and would even forget the fabbath days from
the working days; but to prevent this, I cut it with
my knife upon a large poft, in capital letters, and
making it into a great crofs, 1 fet it up on the more
where I first landed, viz. I came onfoore hcr& on the
30/A of Sept. 1659. Upon the fides of this fquare
poft, I cut every day a notch with my knife, and
every feventh notch was as long again as the reft,
and every first day of the month as long again
as that long one; and thus I kept my calendar, or
weekly, monthly, and yearly reckoning of time.
In the next place v.e are to observe, that among
the many things which I brought out of the fhip in
the feveral voyages, which, as abovementioned, I
made to it, I got feveral things of lefs value, but
not all lefs ufeful to me, which I omittted fetting
down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper,
feveral parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's,
and carpenter's keeping, three or four 'compares, fome mathematical instruments, dials, perfpcctives,
charts, and books of navigation, all which I huddled
together, whether I might want them or no; alfo
I found three very good bibles which came to
me in my cargo from England, and which I had
packed up among my things; feme Portuguese books
alfo,
alfo, and among them two or three popifh prayer,
books, and feveral other books, all which I carefully
fecured. And I must not forget, that we had in the
fhip a dog and two cats, of whofe eminent hiftory
I may have occafion to fay fomething in its place;
for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the
dog, he jumped out of the ship of himfelf, and swam on more to me the day after I went on more with
my firft cargo, and was a trusty fervant to me many
years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me,
nor any company that he could make up to me;
I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he
could not do: as I observed before, I found pen,
ink and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and I mail mew, that while my ink lafted, I kept
things very exact; but after that was gone, I could
not; for I could not make any ink, by any means
that I could devife.
And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithftanding all that I had amaffed
together; and of thefe, this of ink was one, as alfo
fpade, pick-axe and fhovel, to dig or remove the
earth; needles, pins, and thread; as for linen,
I foon learned to want that without much difficulty.
This want of tools made every work I did go on
heavily, and it was near a whole year before I had
entirely finished my little pale or furrounded
habitation: the piles or stakes, which were as
heavy as' I could well lift, were a long time in cutting
and preparing in the woods, and more by far in
bringing home; fo that I fpent fometimes two days
in cutting and bringing home one of thofe pofts,
and a third day in driving it into the ground; for
which
Which purpofe I got a heavy piece of wood at firft,
but at laft bethought myfelf of one of the iron crows,
which however, though I found its yet it made driv-
ing thofe posts or piles very laborious and tedious work..
But what need I have been concerned at the
tedioufnefs of any thing I had to do, feeing I had
time enough to do it in, nor had I any other
employment if that had been over, at Icaft, that I
could foresee, except the ranging the ifland to feel: for food, which I did more or lefs every day.
I now began to confider ferioufly my condition,
and the circumflance I was reduced to, and I drew
up the ftate of my affairs in writing, not fo much
to leave them to any that were to come after me, for
I was like to have but few heirs, as to deliver my
thoughts from daily poring upon them, and afflicting
my mind; and as my reafon began now to master my defpondency, I began to comfort myfelf as well
as t could, and to fet the good against the evil, that
I might have something to diftmguifh my cafe from
worse ; and I Mated it very impartially, like debtor
and creditor, the comforts I enjoyed againft the
miseries I fuffered, thus:
Evil, Good.

the fljip in near enough to
.the Jhore that I have got-
ten out formany necessarythings as will either supplymy wants, or enableme to.
fupply myfclf even as longas I live.
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted tefti-
mony, that there was fcarce any condition in the
world fo miserable, but there was fomething negative
or fomething positiveto be thankful for in it; and let
this ftand as a direction from the experience of the
moft miferable of all conditions in this world, that we
may
may always find in it fomething to comfort ourselves from, and to fet in the defcription of good and evil,
on the credit fide of the account.
Having now brought my mind a little to relifh
my condition, and given over looking out to fea,
to fee if I could fpy a fhip; I fay, giving over thefe
things, I began to apply myfelf to accommodate my
way of living, and to make things as eafy to me as I
could.
I have already defcribed my habitation, which
was a tent under the fide of a rock, furrounded with
a ftrong pale of pofts and cables, but I might now
rather call it a wall, for I raifed a kind of wall up
againft it of turfs, about two foot thick on the out-
fide, and after fome time, I think it was a year and
half, I raifed rafters from it, leaning to the rock,
and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and
fuch things as I could get to keep out the rain,
which I found at fome times of the year very
violent.
I have already obferved how I brought all my
goods into this pale, and into the cave which I
had made behind me: but I must obferve too that
at first this was a confufed heap of goods, which as
they lay in no order, fo they took up all my place,
I had no room to turn myfelf; fo I fet myfelf to
enlarge my cave and works farther into the earth;
for it was a loofe fandy rock, which yielded eafily to
the labour I beftowed on it: and fo when I found I
was pretty fafe as to beasts of prey, I worked side- ways to the right hand into the rock; and then,
turning to the right again, worked quite out, and
G 2 made

made me a door to come out, on the outfide of my pale or fortification.
This gave me not only egrefs and regrefs, as £
were a back-v. fey to my tent and to my storehouse but gave me room to flow my goods. And now I began to apply myfelf to make
neceflary things as I found I moft wanted, particulj
a chair and a table; for without thefe I was not at to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world ; I could not write or eat, or dp feveral things with fo
pleasure without a table.
* .
So I went to work; and here I must needs obferv*jf">
that as reason is the fubftance and original of th«£'
mathematicks, fo by Hating and fquaring every thing by reafon, and by making the moft rational
judgment of things, every man may be in time mafter of every mechanic!? ant. I had never handled.'!
a tool in my life, and yet in time by labour, appli-
cation and contrivance, I found at laft that I wanted
nothing but I could have made it, efpecially if I had
had tools; however, I made abundance of things,
even without tools, and fome with no more tools
than an adze and a hatchet, which perhaps were'
never made that way before, and that with infinite
labour: for example, if I wanted a beard, I had no
other way but to cut down, a tree, fet it on an edge
before me, and hew it flat on either fide with my
axe, till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank,
and then dub it fmooth with my adze. It is true,
by this method I could make but one board out of
a whole tree, but this I had no remedy for but
patience, any" more than I had for the prodigious
deal

fy'.
f-xa,
deal of time and labour which it took me up to make
a plank or board: but my time or labour was
little worth, and fo it was as well employed one way
as another.
However, I made me a table and a chair, as I
obferved above, in the first place, and this I did out
of the fhort pieces of boards that I brought on my
raft from the fhip: but when I had wrought out
fome boards, as above, I made'.large fhelves of the
breadth of a foot and a half one over another, all
along one fide of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails,
and iron-work, and in a wordy to feparate every
thing at large in their places, that I might come
eafily at them; I knocked pieces into the wall of
the rock to hang my guns and all things that would
hang up.
So that had my cave been to be feen, it looked
like a general magazine of all necessary things; and
I had every thing fo ready at my hand, that it w as
a great pleafure to me to fee all my goods in fuch
order, and especially to find my ftock of all necef-
faries fo great.
And now it was that I began to keep a journal
of every day's employment; for indeed at fail I was
in too much a hurry; and not only hurry as to
labour, but in too much difcompofure of mind, and
my journal would have been full of many dull things.
For example, I muft have faid thus; 6V//. the 3cth,
after I. got to more, and had efcapcd drowning,
instead of being thankful to God for my deliverance,
having firft vomited with the great quantity of fait
water which was gotten into my ftomach, and
recovering myfelf a little, I ran about the fi\ore,
G 3 wringing
wringing my hands, and beating my head and face,
exclaiming at my mifery, and crying out, I was
undone, undone; till tired and faint I was forced to
lie down on the ground to repofe, but durst not fleep
for fear of being devoured.
Some days after this, and after I had been on
board the lip, and got all that I could out of her,
yet I could not forbear getting up to the top of a
little mountain, and looking out to fea in hopes of
feeing a fhip; then fancy at a val diftance I fpied a
fail; pleafe myfelf with the hopes cf it; and then
after looking fteadily till I was almost blind, lofe it
quite, and fit down and weep like a child, and thus
encreafe my mifery by my folly.
But having gotten over thefe things in fome
meafure, and having fettled my houfhold-ftuff and
habitation, made me a table and a chair, and all
as handfome about me as I could, I began to keep
my journal, of which I fhall here give you the copy, (though in it will be told all thefe particulars over
again) as long as it lafted; for having no more ink, I was forced to leave it off.
THE JOURNAL.
September 30, 1659.
I POOR miferablzRobinfonCrufoe, being shipwrecked, during a dreadful ftorm, in the offing, came on
Moore on this difmal unfortunate ifland, which I called
the JJland of Defpair, all the reft of the fhip's com-
pany being drowned, and myfelf almoft dead.
All the reft of that day I fpent in afflicting myfelf
at the difmal circumftances I was brought to, viz, I
had
had neither food, houfe, cloaths, weapon, or place
to fly to, and in defpair of sftiy relief, faw nothing
but death before me, either that I should be devoured
by wild beafts, murthered by favages, or ftarved to
death for want of food. At the approach of night
I flept in a tree, for fear of wild creatures, but flept
foundly though it rained all night.
October i. In the morning I faw to my great
furprife the fhip had floated with the high tide, and
was driven on fhore again much nearer the ifland,
which as it was fome comfort on one hand, for feeing
her fit upright, and not broken to pieces, I hoped,
if the wind abated, I might get on board, and get
fome food and neceffaries out of her for my relief;
fo on the other hand, it renewed my grief at the lofs
of my comrades, who I imagined if we had all Raid on board might have faved the lip, or at leaft that
they would not have been all drowned, as they were;
and that, had the men been faved, we might perhaps
have built us a boat out of the ruins of the fhip, to
have carried us to fome other part of the world. I
fpent great part of this day in perplexing myfelf on
thefe things ; but at length, feeing the lip almost dry,
I went upon the fand as near as I could, and then
fwam on board; this day alfo it continued raining,
though with no wind at all.
From the ift of Octoberto the 24th. All thefe
days entirely fpent in many feveral voyages to
get all I could out of the fhip, which I brought
on fhore, every tide of flood, upon rafts.. Much
rain alfo in thefe days, though with fome intervals
of fair weather: but, it feems, this was the rainy
feafon.
G 4 03, 20.
OSl. 20. I overfet my raft, and all the goods Ihad got up upon it; "but being in fhoal water, and
the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of
them when the tide was out.
Oct.25. It rained all night and all day, with
fome gufts of wind, during which time the mip
broke in pieces, the wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be feen, except
the wreck of her, and that only at low water. I
fpent this day in covering and fecuring the goods
which I had faved, that rain might not fpoil
them.
Oct.26. I walked about the more almoft all day,
to find out a place to fix my habitation, greatly
concerned to fecure myfelf from any attack in the
night, either from wild beasts or men. Towards
night I fixed upon a proper place under a rock, and
marked out a femi-circle for my encampment, which
I refolved to ftrengthen with a work, wall, or forti-
fication made of double piles, lined within with cable,
and without with turf.
From the 26th to the 3oth I worked very hard
in carrying all my goods to my new habitation,
though fome part of the time it rained exceeding
hard.
The 31 ft in the morning I went out into the
island with my gun, to fee for fome food, and difcover
the country; when I killed a fhe.goat, and her kid
followed me home, which I afterwards killed alfo,
becaufe it would not feed.
November 1 . I let up my tent under a rock, and lay
there for the first night, making it as large as I could
with ftakes driven in to fwing my hammock upon.
Nov. 2. I fet up all my chefts and boards, and
the pieces of timber which made my rafts, and with
them formed a fence round me, a little within the
place I had marked out for my fortification.
Nov. 3. I went out with my gun, and killed
two fowls like ducks, which were very good
food. In the afternoon went to work to make me
a table.
Nov. 4. This morning I began to order my times
of work, of going out with my gun, time of fleep,
and time of diversion ; viz. every morning I walked
out with my gun for two or three hours, if it did not
rain, then employed myfelf to work till about eleven
o'clock, then eat what I had to live on, and from
twelve to two I lay down to fleep, the weather being
excessive hot, and then in the evening to work
again: the working part of this day and of the
next were wholly employed in making my table, for
I was yet but a very forry workman, though
time and neceffity made me a compleat natural
rnechanick foon after, as I believe it would do any
one elfe.
Nov. 5. This day went abroad with my gun and
my dog, and killed a wild cat, her fkin pretty foft,
but her flesh good for nothing: every creature I
killed I took off the skins and preferved them.
Coming back by the seashore I faw many forts of
fea-fowls, which I did not understand ; but was
fur prized and almoft frighted with two or three
feals, which, while I was gazing at, not well
knowing what they were, got into the lea, and
escaped me for that time,
Nov. 6.
Nov. 6. After my morning walk I went to work
with my table again, and finished it, though not to
my liking; nor was it long before I learned to
mend it.
Nov. 7. Now it began to be fettled fair weather.
The 7th, 8th, gth, loth, and part of the i2th,
(for the i ith was Sunday) I took wholly up to make
me a chair, and with much ado brought it to a tole-
rable fhapc, but never to pleafe me; and even in
the making I pulled it in pieces feveral times.
Note, I foon neglected my keeping Sundays, for
omitting my mark for them on my port, I forgot
which was which.
Nov. 13. This day it rained, which refreshed me
exceedingly, and cooled the earth, but it was accom-
panied with terrible thunder and lightning, which
frighted me dreadfully for fear of my powder: as
foon as it was over I refolved to feparate my ftock of
powder into as many little parcels as possible, that it
might not be in danger.
Nov. 14, 15, 16. Thefe three days I fpent in
making little fquare chefts or boxes, which might
hold about a pound, or two pound, at moft, of
powder; and fo putting the powder in, I flowed it
in places as fecure and remote from one another as
poffible. On one of thefe three days I killed a
large bird that was good to eat, but I knew not
what to call it.
Nov. 17. This day I began to dig behind my tent
into the rock, to make room for my farther conve-
niency. Note, Three things I wanted exceedingly
for this work, viz. a pick-axe, a fhovel, and a wheel-
barrow
barrow'or basket, fo I defifted from my work, and
began to confider how to fupply that want, and make
me fome tools: as for a pick-axe, I made ufe of the
iron crows, which were proper enough, though
heavy ; but the next thing was a fhovel or fpade;
this was fo abfolutely neceffary, that indeed I could
do nothing effectually without it; but what kind of
one to make I knew not.
Nov. 18. The next day in fearching the woods I
found a tree of that wood, or like it, which in
the Brafil s they call the Iron Tree, for its exceeding
hardnefs; of this, with great labour and almoft
fpoiling my axe, I cut a piece, and brought it
home too with difficulty enough, for it was exceeding
heavy.
The excefTive hardnefs of the wood, and having
no other way, made me a long while upon this
machine; for I worked it effectually by little and
little into the form of a fhovel or fpade, the handle
exactly shaped like ours in England, only that the
broad part having no iron fhod upon it at bottom, it
would not laft me fo long; however it ferved well
enough for the ufes which I had occafion to put it to;
but never was a fhovel, I believe, made after that
fashion, or fo long a making.
I was flill deficient, for I wanted a bafket or a
wheel-barrow; a basket I could not make by any
means, having no fuch things as twigs that would
bend to make wicker ware, at leaft none yet found
out; and as to a wheel-barrow, I fancied I could
make all but the wheel, but that I had no notion of,
neither did I know how to go about it; befides I
had no possible way to make the iron gudgeons for
the
the fpindlc or axis of the wheel to run in, fo I gave
it over; and fo for carrying away the earth which I
dug out of the cave, I made me a thing like a hodd
which the labourers carry mortar in, when they
ferve the bricklayers.
This was not fo difficult to me as the making the
fhovel; and yet this, and the fhovel, and the attempt
which I made in vain to make a wheelbarrow, took
me up no lefs than four days, I mean always, except-
ing my morning walk with my gun, which I feldom
failed; and very feldom failed alfo bringing home
fomething to eat.
Nov. 23. My other work having now ftood ftil!,
becaufe of my making thefe tools, when they were
finished I went on, and working every day, as my
strength and time allowed, I fpent eighteen days
entirely in widening and deepening my cave, that it
might hold my goods commodioufly.
Note, During all this time, I worked to make this
room or cave spacious enough to accommodate me
as a warehoufe or magazine, a kitchen, a dining- room, and a cellar; as for my lodging, I kept to the
tent, except that fometimes in the wet feafon of the
year, it rained fo hard that I could not keep myfelf
dry, which caufed me afterwards to cover all my
place within my pale with long poles in the form of
rafters, leaning against the rock, and load them with
flags and large leaves of trees like a thatch.
December 10. I began now to think my cave or
vault finished, when on a fudden (it feems I had
made it too large) a great quantity of earth fell down
from the top and one fide, fo much that in fhort it'
frighted me, and not without reason too; fqr if I had
been
been under it I had never wanted a grave-digger;
upon this difafter I had a great deal of, work to do
over again; for I had the loofe earth to carry out,
and, which was of more importance, I had the deling
to prop up, fo that I might be fure no more would
come down.
Dec, 11. This day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two mores or posts pitched upright to
the top, with two pieces of boards a.crofs over each
poft; this I finished the next day; and fetting more
pofts up with boards, in about a week more Ihad the roof fecured; and the pofts, funding in rows,
ferved me for partitions to part off my horfe.
Dec. 17. From this day to the twentieth I placed
delves, and knocked up nails on the pofts to hang every thing up that could be hung up, and now I
began to be in fome order within doors.
Dec. 20. Now I carried every thing into the cave,
and began to furnifh my houfe, and fet up fome
pieces of boards, like a drefier, to order my victuals
. upon, but boards began to be very fcarce with me;
alfa I made me another table.
Dec. 24. Much rain all night and all day; no
stirring out.
Dec. 25. Rain all day.
Dec. 26. No rain, and the earth much cooler than
before, and plcafanter.
Dec. 27. Killed a young goat, and lamed another,
fothat I caught it, and led it home in a firing; when
I had it home, I bound and fplintered up its leg,
which was broke. N. B. I took fuch care of it,
that it lived, and the leg grew well and as ftrong as
ever; but by nurfmg it fo long it grew tame, and
fed
fed upon the little green at my door, and would not
go away: this was the firft time that I entertained a
thought of breeding up fome tame creatures, that
I might have food when my powder and shot was
all fpent.
Dec. 28, 29, 30. Great heats and no breeze;
fo that there was no Mil.ring abroad, except in the
evening for food; this time I fpent in putting all my
things in order within doors.
yanuary i. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad early
and late with my gun, and lay ftill in the middle of
the day. This evening, going farther into the
valleys, which lay towards the center of the island, I found there was plenty of goats, though exceeding
fhy and hard to come at; however I refolved to try
if I could not bring my dog to hunt them down.
yan. i. Accordingly, the next day, I went out
with my dog, and fet him upon the goats; but I was
mistaken, for they all faced about upon the dog; and
he knew his danger too well, for he would not come
near them.
yan. 3. I began my fence or wall; which, being
full jealous of my being attacked by fome body, I
refolved to make very thick and ftrong.
N. B. 'This wallbeing defcribed before, I
purposelyomit what wasfaid in the journal;
it is sufficientto obferve, that I was no tefs
time than from the $d of January to the iqtb
of April, working, Jinijhing, and perfecting
this wall,though it was no more than about
24 yards in length, being a halfcircle from
one place in the rock to another place about
eight yards from it, the door of the cave being
in the center behind it.
All
All this time I worked very hard, the rains
hindering me many days, nay, fometimes weeks
together; but I thought I would never be perfectly
fecure until this wall was finifhed; and it is fcarce
credible what inexpreffible labour every thing was
done with, efpecially the bringing piles out of the
woods, and driving them into the ground, for I
made them much bigger than I need to have done.
When this wall was finished, and the outside double fenced with a turf-wall raifed up clofe to it,
I perfuaded myself that if any people were to come
on more there, they would not perceive any thing
like a habitation ; and it was very well I did fo, as may
be observed hereafter upon a very remarkable occasion. During this time I made my rounds in the woods
for game every day, when the rain admitted me, and
made frequent difcoveries in thefe walks of fomething
or other to my advantage; particularly I found a
kind of wild pigeons, who built not as wood
pigeons in a tree, but rather as houfe pigeons, in
the holes of the rocks; and taking fome young ones,
I endeavoured to breed them up tame, and did fo;
but when they grew older they flew away, which
perhaps was at first for want of feeding them, for I
had nothing to give them; however I frequently
found their pelts, and got their young ones, which
were very good meat.
And now, in the .managing my household affairs, I
found myself wanting in many things, which I
thought at firft it was impoffible for me to..make, as
indeed as to fome of them it was; for inftance, I
could never make a cafk to be hooped; I had, a finall
runlet or two, as I obferved before, but I could never
arrive
arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though
I fpent many weeks about it; I could neither put in the heads, or joint the ftaves fo true to one another
as to make them hold water, fo I gave that alfo over.
In the next place, I was at a great lofs for candle;
fo that as foon as ever it was dark, which was gene-
rally by feven o'clock, I was obliged to go to bed: I
remembered the lump of beeswax with which I made
candles in my African adventure, but I had none of
that now; the only remedy I had, was, that when I
had killed a goat I faved the tallow, and with a little
difh made of clay, which I baked in the fun, to which
I added a wick of fome oakum, I made me a lamp;
and this gave me light, though not a clear steady light like a candle; in the middle of all my labours
it happened, that rummaging my things, I found a little bag, which, as I hinted before, had been filled
with corn for the feeding of poultry, not for this
voyage, but before, as I fuppofe, when the lip came from Lisbon; what little remainder of corn had
been in the bag, was all devoured with the rats, and
I faw nothing in the bag but husks and duft; and
being willing to have the bag for fome other ufe, I
think it was to put powder in, when I divided it for
fear of the lightning, or fome fuch ufe, I mook the hufks of corn out of it on one fide of my fortification
under the rock.'
It was a little before the great rains, juft now men-
tioned, that I threw this fluff away, taking no notice
of any thing, and not fo much as remembering that I
had thrown any thing there; when about a month
after, or thereabout, I faw fome few flalks of some- thing green fhooting out of the ground, which I
fancied
fancied might be fome plant I had not seen, but I
was fu'rprized and perfe&ly aftonifhed, when after a
little longer time I faw about ten or twelve ears
come out, which were perfect green barley of the
fame kind as our European, nay, as our Englishbarley.
It is impoffible to exprefs the aftonifhment and
confufion of my thoughts on this occafion; I had
hitherto acted upon no religious foundation at all;
indeed I had very few notions of religion in my
head, or had entertained any fenfe of any thing that
had befallen me, otherwife than as a chance, or, as
we lightly fay, what pleafes God; without fo much
as enquiring into the end of Providence in thefe
things, or his order in governing events in the world:
but after I faw barley grow there, in a climate which
I knew was not proper for corn, and efpecially that
I knew not how it came there, it ftartled me
ftrangely, and I began to fuggeft, that God had mira-
culoufly caufed this grain to grow without any help
of feed fown, and that it was fo directed purely for
my sustenance on that wild miferable place.
This touched my heart a little, and brought tears
out of my eyes, and I began to blefs myfelf, that
fuch a prodigy of nature would happen upon my
account; and this was the more ftrange to me,
becaufe I faw near it ftill, all along by the fide of the
rock, fome other ftragling ftalks, which proved to
be stalks of rice, and which I knew, becaufe I had
feen it grow in Africa, when I was afhore there.
I not only thought thefe the pure productions of
Providence for my fupport, but not doubting but
that there was more in the place, I went all over
VOL. I. H that
p3 LIPE AND
that part of the island, where'Ihad been before, peering in every corner and under every rock to fee for more
of it, but I could not find any; at laft it occurred
to my thought, that I had fhook a bag of chickens meat
out in that place, and then the wonder began to ceafe;
and I must confess, my religious thankfulnefs to God's
providence "began to abate too upon discovering that all this was nothing but what was common;
though I ought to have been as thankful for fa
ftrange and unforefeen a providence as if it had been
miraculous ; for it was really the work of Providence
as to me, that should order or appoint 10 or 12
grains of corn to remain unfpoiled, when the rats
had destroyed all the reft, as if it had been dropt
from heaven : as alfo, that I should throw it out in that particular place, where, it being in the made of
a high rock, it sprang up immediately; whereas if I
had thrown it any where elfe at that time, it had been
burnt up and destroyed. I carefully faved the ears of corn, you may be
fure, in their feafon, which was about the end of
June, and laying up every corn, I refolved to fow
them all again, hoping in time to have forrie quantity
sufficient tosupply me with bread; but it was not till
the fourth year that I could allow myfelf the Icaft "ram
of this corn to eat, and even then but fparingly, as I
mall fav afterwards in its order; for I loft all that I
fowed the firft feafon, by not obferving the proper
time; for I fowed it just before the dry feafon, fo
that it never came up at all, at leaft not as it would
have done: of which in its place.
Befides this barley, there were, as above, 20 or 30.
ftalks of rice, which I preferved with the fame care,
and
sihd whofe ufe was of the fame kind or to the fame
purpofe, viz. To make me bread, or rather food;
for I found ways to cook it up without baking, though
I did that alfo after fome time. But to return to
my journal*
I worked excessive hard these three or four months
to get my wall done; and the i4th of April I clofed
it up, contriving to go into it, not by a door, but
over the wall by a ladder, that there might be no
fign in the outfide of my habitation.
April 16. I finished the ladder, fo I went up with
the ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me,
and let it down on the infide: this was a compleat
enclofure to me; for within I had room enough, and
nothing could come at me from without, unlefs it
could first mount my wall.
The very next day after this wall was finished, I
had almost had all my labour overthrown at once,
and myfelf killed; the cafe was thus: As I was bufy
in the inside of it, behind my tent, just in the
entrance into my cave, I was terribly frighted with a
moft dreadful furprizing thing indeed; for on a
fudden I found the earth come crumbling down from
the roof of my cave, and from the edge of the hill,
over my head, and two of the posts I had fet up in
the cave cracked in a frightful manner: I was
heartily feared, but thought nothing of what was
really the cause, only thinking that the top of my
cave was falling in, as fome of it had done before;
and for fear I fhould be buried in it, I ran forward
to my ladder, and not thinking myfelf fafe there
neither, I got over my wall for fear of the pieces of
the hill which I expected might roll down upon me:
II 2 I was
753723 A
I was no fooner ftept down upon the firm ground,
but I plainly faw it was a terrible earthquake, for the
ground I stood on look three times at about eight
minutes distance, with three fuch fhocks, as would
have overturned the ftrongeft building that could be
fuppofed to have ftood on the earth; and a great
piece of the top of a rock, which stood about half a
mile from me next the fea, fell down with fuch a
terrible noife as I never heard in all my life: I per-
ceived alfo the very fea was put into violent jnotiort
by it; and I believe the fhocks were ftronger under
the water than on the ifland.
I was fo amazed with the thing itfelf, having never
felt the like, or difcourfed with any one that had,
that I was like one dead or ftupified; and the motion
of the earth made my stomach fick, like one that was
tofled at fea; but the noife of the falling of the rock
awaked me, as it were, and rouzing me from the
ftupified condition I was in, filled me with horror,
and I thought of nothing then but the hill falling
upon my tent, and all my houfhold goods, and
burying all at once; and this funk my very foul
within me a fecond time.
After the third fhock was over, and I felt no more
for fome time, I began to take courage, and yet I had
not heart enough to get over my wall again, for fear
of being buried alive, but fat ftill upon the ground,
greatly caft down and difconfolate, not knowing
what to do: all this while I had not the leaft ferious
religious thought, nothing but the common, Lord
have mercy upon me; and when it was over, that
went away too.
While
"While I fat thus, I found the air overcast, and
grow cloudy, as if it would rain; foon after that
the wind xrofe by little and little, fo that in lefs than
half an hour it blew a moft dreadful hurricane: the
fea was all on a fudden covered over with foam and
froth, the lore was covered with the breach of
the water, the trees were torn up by the roots,
and a terrible ftorm it was; and this held about
three hours, and then began to abate, and in two
hours more it was stark calm, and began to rain
very hard.
All this while I fat upon the ground, very much
terrified and dejected, when on a fudden it came
into my thoughts, that thefe winds and rain being
the confequence of the earthquake, the earthquake
itfelf was fpent and over, and I might venture into
my cave again: with this thought my fpirits began
to revive, and the rain alfo helping to perfuade me,
I went in and fat down in my tent, but the rain was
fo violent, that my tent was ready to be beaten down
with it; and I was forced to go into my cave,
though very much afraid and uneafy, for fear it should fall on my head.
This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz,
to cut a hole through my new fortification like a fmk,
to let water go out, which would elfe have drowned
my cave. After I had been in my cave fome time, and
found full no more shocks of the earthquake follow,
I began to be more compofed; and now, to fupport
my fpirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I
went to my little ftore, and took a fmall fup of rum,
which however I did then and always very fparingly,
knowing I could have no more when that was gone.
H It
It continued raining all that night, and great part
of the next day, fo that I could not ftir abroad; but
my mind being more compofed, I began to think of
what I had beft do, concluding, that if the ifland
was subject to thefe earthquakes, there would be no
living for me in a cave, but I muf t confider ofbuikl-
ing me fome little hut in an open place, which I
might furround with a wall as I had done here, and
fo make myfelf fecure from wild beasts or men: but
concluded, if I ftaid where I was, I would certainly,
one time or other, be buried alive.
With thefe thoughts I refolved to remove my tent
from the place where it ftood, which was just under
the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it
fhould be fhaken again, would certainly fall upon my
tent: and I fpent the two next days, being the igth
and 2oth of April, in contriving where and how to
remove my habitation.
The fear of being fwallowed up alive, made me
that I never flept in quiet, and yet the apprehenfion
of lying abroad without any fence was almoft equal
to it; but still, when I looked about and faw how
every thing was put in order, how pleafantly con-
cealed I was, and how fafe from danger, it made
me very loth to remove.
In the mean time it occurred to me that it would
require a wait deal of.time for me to do this, and that
I muft be contented to run the venture where I was,
till I had formed a camp for myfelf, and had fecured
it fo as to remove to it: fo with this refolution I
compofed myself for a time, and refolved that I would
go to work with all fpeed to build me a wall with piles
and cables, &c. in a circle as before; and fet my
tent
tent up in it when it was finished, but that I would
venture to ftay where I was till it was finished and fit
to remove to. This was the 21 ft.
April 22. The next morning I began to confider
of means to put this refolve in execution, but I was
at a great lofs about my tools; I had three large
axes and abundance of hatchets, (for we carried the
hatchets for traffic with the Indians)but with much
chopping and cutting knotty hard wood, they were
all full of notches and dull, and though I had a grind-
flone, I could not turn it and grind my tools too;'
this coil me as much thought as a Ilatefmsn would
O
have bestowed upon a grand point of politicks, or a
judge upon the life and death of a man. At length
I contrived a wheel with a firing,, to turn it with my
foot, that I might have both my hands at liberty:
Note, I had never feen any fuch thing in England, or
at leaft not to take notice how it was done, though
fmce I have obferved it is very common there;
befides that, my grindstone was very large and
heavy. This 'machine coit me a full week's work to
bring it to perfection.
April 28, 29. Thefe two whole days I took up
in grinding my tools, my machine for turning my
grind-ftone performing very well.
April 30, Having perceived my bread had been
low a great while, now I took a furvey of it, and
reduced myself to one bifcait-cake a day, which
made my heart very heavy,
May I . In the morning, looking towards the fea-
fide, the tide being low, I faw something lie on the
bore bigger than ordinary; and it looked like a cask .,
when I came to it, I found a fmall barrel, and two H 4' or
or three pieces of the wreck of the fhip; which
were driven on fhore by the late hurricane;
and looking towards the wreck itfelf, I thought it
feemed to lie higher out of the water than it ufed to
do: I examined the barrel which was driven on
fhore, and foon found it was a barrel of gunpowder,
but it had taken water, and the powder was caked
as hard as a ftone; however I rolled it farther on fhore
for the prefent, and went on upon the fands as near as
I could to the wreck of the fhip, to look for more.
When I came down to the lip, I found it ftrangely
removed; the fore-caftle, which lay before buried
in fand, was heaved up at leaft fix foot; and the
ftern, which was broke to pieces, and parted from
the reft by the force of the fea, foon after I had left
rummaging her, was tofied, as it were, up, and caft.
on one fide, and the fand was thrown fo high on
that fide next her ftern, that whereas there was a
great place of water before, fo that I could not come
within a quarter of a mile of the wreck without
fwimming, I could now walk quite up to her when
the tide was out; I was furprized with this at first, but foon concluded it must be done by the earth-
quake: and as by this violence the fhip was more
broken open than formerly, fo many things came
daily on lore, which the fea had loofened, and which
the winds and water rolled by degrees to the land.
This wholly diverted my thoughts from the defign
of removing my habitation; and I buried myfelf
mightily that day efpecially, in fearching whether I
could make any way into the fhip; but I found
nothing was to be expected of that kind, for that
'all the inside of the lip was choaked up with fand:
however,
however, as I had learnt not to defpair of any thing,
I refolved to pull every thing to pieces that I could
of the fhip, concluding, that every thing I could get
from her would be of fome ufe or other to me.
May 3. I began with my faw, and cut a piece of a
beam through, which I thought held fome of the
upper part or quarter-deck together, and when I had
cut it through, I cleared away the fand as well as I
could from the fide which lay highest ; but the
tide coming in, I was obliged to give over for
that time.
May 4. I went a finding, but caught not one fish that I durst eat of, till I was weary of my fport; when
juft going to leave off, I caught a young dolphin. I
had made me a long line of fome rope-yarn, but I had
no hooks, yet I frequently caught fifh enough, as
much as I cared to eat; all which I dried in the fun,
and eat them dry.
May 5. Worked on the wreck, cut another beam
afunder, and brought three great fir planks off from
the decks, which I tied together, and made swim on fhore when the tide of flood came on.
May 6. Worked on the wreck, got feveral iron
bolts out of her, and other pieces of iron-work,
worked very hard, and came home very much tired,
and had thoughts of giving it over.
May 7. Went to the wreck again, but with an
intent not to work, but found the weight of the
wreck had broke itfelf down, the beams being cut,
that feveral pieces of the fhip feemed to lie loofe,
and the infide of the hold lay fo open, that I could
fee into it, but almoft full of water and fand.
May 8.
May 8. Went to the wreck, and carried an iron
crow to wrench up the deck, which lay now
quite clear of the water or fand; I wrenched open
two planks, and brought them on more alfo with
the tide: I left the iron crow in the wreck for
next day.
May 9. Went to the wreck, and with the crow
made way into the body of the wreck, and felt
feveral cafks, and loofened them with the crow,
but could not break them up; I felt alfo the roll of
Englishlead, and could ftir it, but it was too heavy
to remove.
May 10, n, 12, 13, 14. Went every day to the
wreck, and got a great many pieces of timber,
and boards, or plank, and 2 or 300 weight of
iron.
May 15. I carried two hatchets, to try if I
could not cut a piece off the roll of lead, by
placing the edge of one hatchet, and driving it
with the other; but as it lay about a foot and a half
in the water, I could not make any blow to drive
the hatchet.
May 16. It had bio wed hard in the night, and
the wreck appeared more broken by the force of the
water; but I ftaid fo long in the woods to get
pigeons for food, that the tide prevented me going
to the wreck that dav.
s
May 17. I faw fome pieces of the wreck blown
on fhore, at a great distance, near two miles off
me, but refolved to fee what they were, and found
it was a piece of the head, but too heavy for me to
bring away.
May 24,
May 24. Every day to this day I worked on the
wreck, and with hard labour I loofened fome things
fo much with the crow, that the first blowing tide
feveral cafks floated out, and two of the feamen's
chefts; but the wind blowing from the lore, nothing came to land that day but pieces of
timber, and a hogshead, which had fome Brazil
pork in it, but the falt-water and the fand had
fpoiled it.
I continued this work every day to the i5& of
June, except the time neceflary to get food, which
I always appointed, during this part of my employ-
ment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be
ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time I
had gotten timber, and plank, and iron-work enough
to have built a good boat, if I had known how j and
also, I got at feveral times, and in feveral pieces,
near 100 weight of the meet-lead.
Jung 16. Going down to the fea-fide, I found a
large tortoife or turtle; this was the first I had feen,
which it feems was only my misfortune, not any
defect of the place, or fcarcity ; for had I happened
to be on the other fide of the island, I might have
had hundreds of them every day, as I found
afterwards; but perhaps had paid dear enough for
them.
June 17 I fpent in cooking the turtle; I found
in her threefcore eggs; and her flesh was to me at
that time the moft favoury and pleafant that ever
I tasted in my life, having had no flefh, but of
goats and fowls, fmce I landed in this horrid
place.
June 18.
1 8. Rained all day, and I stayed within. I
thought at this time the rain felt cold, and I was
fcmething chilly, which I knew was not ufual in
that latitude.
yune \ g. Very ill, and fhivering, as if the weather
had been cold.
yune 23. No reft all night, violent pains in my
head, and feverifh.
yune 21. Very ill, frighted almoft to death with
the apprehenfions of my fad condition, to be fick,
and no help: Prayed to GOD for the firft time
fince the ftorm off Hull, but fcarce knew what I
faid, or why; my thoughts being all confufed.
yune 22. A little better, but under dreadful
apprehenfions of ficknefs.
yune 23. Very bad again, cold and fhivering, and
then a violent head-ach.
yune 24. Much better.
yune 25. An ague very violent; the fit held me
feven hours, cold fit and hot, with faint fweats
after it.
yune 2.6. Bettter; and having no victuals to eat,
took my gun, but found myfelf very weak; however
I killed a fhe-goat, and with much difficulty got
it home, and broiled fome of it, and eat; I would
fain have stewed it, and made fome broth, but had
no pot,
June 27. The ague again fo violent, that I lay
a-bed all day, and neither eat or drank. I was ready
to perifh for thjrft, but fo weak I had not ftrength
to fland up, or to get myfelf any water to drink:
prayed to GOD again, but was light-headed; and
when when I was not I was fo ignorant, that I knew not
what to fay; only I lay and cried, Lord look upon me;
Lord pity me; Lord have mercy upon me: I fuppofe
I did nothing elfe for two or three hours, till the fit
wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in
the night; when I waked, I found myfelf much
refrefhed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty : how-
ever, as I had no water in my whole habitation,
I was forced to lie till morning, and went to fleep again: In this fecond sleep I had this terrible
dream.
I thought that I was fitting on the ground on
the out-fide of my wall, where I fat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I faw a man
defcend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame
of fire, and light upon the ground: He was all over
as bright as a flame, fo that I could but just bear to
look towards him; his countenance was most inex-
preffibly dreadful, impoffible for words to defcribe;
when he stepped upon the ground with his feet
I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done
before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to
my apprehenfion as if it had been filled with flames
of fire.
He was no fooner landed upon the earth, but he
moved forward towards me, with a long spear or
weapon in his hand to kill me; and when he came
to a rifing ground, at fome distance, he fpoke to
me, or I heard a voice fo terrible, that it is impoffible
to exprefs the terror of it; all that I can fay I
understood was this, Seeing all thcfc things have not
brought thee to repentance, now thou faultdie: at
which
which words I thought he lifted up the fpear that
was in his hand to kill me.
No one, that fhall ever read this account, will
expect that I fhould be able to defcribe the horrors
of my foul at this terrible vifion; I mean, that even
while it was a dream, I even dreamed of thofe
horrors; nor is it any more poffible to defcribe the
impression that remained upon my mind, when I
awaked, and found it was but a dream.
I had, alas! no divine knowledge; what I had
received by the good instruction of my father was
then worn out by an uninterrupted feries, for eight
years,, of feafaring wickednefs, and a conftant
converfation with nothing but fuch as were like
myself, wicked and prophane to the laft degree;
I do not remember that I had in all that time one'
thought that fo much as tended either to looking
upwards toward GOD, or inwards towards a reflection upon my own ways: but a certain ftupidity of foul,
without defire of good, or confcience of evil, had
entirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the moft
hardened, unthinking, wicked creature among our
common failors can be fuppofed to be, not having
the leaft fenfe, either of the fear of GOD in danger, or
of thankfulnefs to GOD in deliverances.
In the relating what is already paft of my ftory,
this will be the more eafily believed, when I mail add, that through all the variety of miferies that
had to this day befallen' me, I never had fo much
as one thought of it being the hand of GOD, or
that it was a juft punifhment for my fm, my
rebellious behaviour againft my father, or my
prefent
prefent fins, which were great; or fo much as a
punishment for the general courfe of my wicked
life. When I was on the defperate expedition on
the defart fhores of Africa, I never had fo much as
one thought of what would become of me; or one
wish to God to direct me whither I fhould go, or
to keep me from the danger which apparently
furrounded me, as well from voracious creatures as
cruel favages: but I was meerly thoughtlefs of a
God, or a Providence, acted like a meer brute from
the principles of nature, and by the dictates of com-
mon fenfe only, and indeed hardly that.
When I was delivered, and taken up at fea by the
Portugal captain, well ufed, and dealt justly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not the
leaft thankfulnefs on my thoughts: when again I
\vasfhipwrecked, ruined, and in danger of drowning
on this island, I was as far from remorfe, or looking
on it as a judgment; I only faid to myfelf often,
that I was an unfortunate dog, and born to be always
miferable.
It is true, when I got on more first here, and
found all my fhip's crew drowned, and myfelf
fpared, I was furprized with a kind of extafy, and
fome tranfports of foul, which, had the grace of
God affifted, might have come up to true thank-
fulnefs; but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common flight of joy, or, as I may fay, being glad
I was alive, without the Jeaft reflection upon the
difHnguifhing goodnefs of the hand which had
preserved me, and had fmgled me out to be pre-
ferved, when all the reds were deftroyed; or an
inquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to
me;
me; even just the fame common fort of joy which
feamen generally have, after they have got fafe
on shore from a fhipwreck, which they drown all in
the next bowl of punch, and forget almoft as
foon as it is over; and all the reft of my life was like it.
Even when I was afterwards, on due confidera.
tion, made fenfible of my condition, how I was
cal on this dreadful place, out of the reach of
human kind, out of all hope of relief, or prospect of
redemption, as foon as I faw but a prospect of living,
and that I would not ftarve and perish for hunger,
all the fenfe of my affliction wore off, and I began
to be very eafy, applied myfelf to the works proper
for my prefervation and fupply, and was far enough
from being afflicted at my condition, as a judgment
from heaven, or as the hand of God againft me:
thefe were thoughts which very feldom entered into my head.
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my
journal, had at first fome little influence upon me,
and began to affect me with ferioufnefs, as long as I
thought it had fomething miraculous in it; but as
foon as ever that part of thought was removed, all
the impreffion which was raifed from it wore off alfo, as I have noted already.
Even the earthquake, though nothing could be
more terrible in its nature, or more immediately
directing to the invifible power, which alone directs
fuch things; yet no fooner was the firft fright over,
but the impreffion it had made went off alfo. I
had no more fenfe of God, or his judgments, much
lefs of the prefent affliction of my circumftances being
front From his hand, than if I had been in the moft
profperous condition of life.
But now, when I began to be fick, and aleifurely
view of the miferies of death came to place itfelf
before me; when my fpirits began to fink under the
burden of a strong diftemper, and nature was
exhausted with the violence of the fever; confcience,
that had flept fo long, began to awake, and I began
to reproach myfelf with my paf t life, in which I
had fo evidently, by uncommon wickednefs, pro-
voked the justice of GOD to lay me under
uncommon ftrokes, and to deal with me in fo
vindictive a manner.
Thefe reflections opprefled me from the fecond or third day of my diftemper, and in the violence, as
well of the fever as of the dreadful reproaches of my
confcience, extorted fome words from me, like
praying to GOD, though I cannot fay they were
'either a prayer attended with defires, or with hopes;
it was rather the voice of mere fright and diftrefs;
my thoughts were confufed, the convictions great
upon my mind, and the horror of dying in fuch a
miferable condition, raifed vapours into my head
with the mere apprehenfions; and, in thefe hurries
of my foul, I knew not what my tongue might
exprefs: But it was rather exclamation, such as,
Lord i what a miferable creature am I ! If I would be fick, I mall certainly die for want of help, and
what will become of me! Then the tears burst out of my eyes, and I could fay no more for a
good while.
In this interval, the good advice of my father
came to my mind, and prefently his prediction,
VOL. L I which
which I mentioned in the beginning of this story ;
viz. That if I did take this foolifh ftep, GOD would
not blefs me, and I would have leifure hereafter to
reflect upon having neglected his counfel, when
there might be none to affift in my recovery.
Now, faid I aloud, my dear father's words are come
to pafs: GOD'S juftice has overtaken me, and I have
none to help or hear me: I rejected the voice of
Providence, which had mercifully put me in a pofture
or station of life wherein I might have been happy
and eafy; but I would neither fee it myfelf, nor
learn to know the bleffing of it from my parents;
I left them to mourn over my folly, and now I am
left to mourn under the confequences of it: I refufed
their help and assistance, who would have lifted me
into the world, and would have made every thing
eafy to me; and now I have difficulties to ftruggle
with, too great for even nature itfelf to fupport,
and no affiftance, no help, no comfort, no advice.
Then I cried out, Lord, be my help, for I am in
great diftrefs.
This was the firft prayer, if I might call it fo,
that I had made for many years. But I return to
my journal.
yune 28. Having been fomewhat refreshed with
the fleep I had had, and the fit being entirely off, I
got up: and though the fright and terror of my
dream was very great, yet I confidered, that the fit
of the ague would return again the next day, and
now was my time to get fomething to refrefh and
fupport myfelf when I fhould be ill; and the firft
thing I did, I filled a large fquare cafe bottle with
water, and a it upon my table, in reach of my bed;
and
and to take off the chill or aguifh difpofitlon of the
water, I put about a quarter of a pint of rum into it,
and mixed them together; then I got me a piece of
the goat's flesh, and broiled it on the coals, but
could eat very little; I walked about, but was very
weak, and withal, very fad and heavy-hearted under
a fenfe of my miferable condition, dreading the
return of my distemper the next day; at night I
made my fupper of three of the turtle's eggs, which
I roasted in the ames, and eat, as we call it, in the
fhell; and this was the firft bit of meat I had ever
afked GOD'S bleffing to, even, as I could remember, in my whole life.
After I had eaten I tried to walk; but found
myfelf fo weak, that I could hardly carry the gun
(for I never went out without that;) fo I went
but a little way, and fat down upon the ground,
looking out upon the fea, which was juft before me,
and very calm and smooth. As I fat here, fome
fuch thoughts as thefe occurred to me.
What is the earth and fea, of which I have feen fo
much? Whence is it produced? And what am I,
and' all the other creatures, wild and tame, human
and brutal, whence are we?
Sure we are all made by fome fecret power, who
formed the earth and fea, the air and fky; and who
is that?
Then it followed, melt naturally: it is GOD that has
made it all: well, but then it came on ftrangely; if
GOD has made all these things, he guides and governs
them all, and all things that concern them; for the
Being that could make all things, muft certainly
have power to guide and direct them.
I2 If
If fo, nothing can happen in the great circuit of
his works, either without his knowledge or appoint" ment.
And if nothing happens without his knowledge, he knows that I am here, and am in a dreadful
condition; and if nothing happens without his
appointment, he has appointed all this to befal me.
Nothing occurred to my thoughts to contradict
any of these conclufions; and therefore it refted
upon me with the greater force, that it muft needs
be, that GOD had appointed all this to befal me;
that I was brought to this miferable circumftance by
his direction, he having the fole power, not of me
only, but of every thing that happened in the world.
Immediately it followed,
Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be
thus vfed?
My confcience prefently checked me in that
inquiry, as if I had blafphemed; and methought it
fpoke to me, like a voice; Wretch! doft thou ajh
what thou haft done? look back upon a dreadful
mif-fpent life, and afk thyfelf what thou haji not done?
ask, why is it that thou wert not long ago destroyed?why wert thou not drowned in Yarmouth Roads?
killed in the fight when the APwas taken by the
Sallee man of war? devoured by the wild be.ajis on the
coastof Africa? Or, drowned HERE, when all
the crew perishedbut thyself? Doft thou ask, What
have I done?
I was struck with thefe refledtions as one
aftonifhed, and had not a word to fay, no, not to
anfwer to myfelf; but rofe up penfive and fad,
walked back to my retreat, and went up over my
wall,
wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts
were fadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to
sleep ; fo I fat down in my chair, and lighted my
lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the
apprehenfions of the return of my diftemper terrified
me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the
Brafilians take no phyfic but their tobacco, for
almofh all distempers ; and I had a piece of a roll
of tobacco in one of the chefts, which was quite
cured, and fome alfo that was green, and not quite
cured.
I went, directed by heaven, no doubt! for in this
chest I found a cure both for foul and body; I opened
the cheft, and found what I looked for, viz. the
tobacco; and as the few books I had faved lay there
too, I took out one of the bibles which I mentioned
before, and which, to this time, I had not found
Jeifure, or fo much as inclination, to look into; I
fay I took it out, and brought both that and the
tobacco with me to the table,
What ufe to make of the tobacco I knew not, as
to my diftemper, or whether it was good for it or
no; but I tried feveral experiments with it, as if I
'was. refolved it fhould hit one way or other: I first took a piece of a leaf, and chewed it in my mouth,
which indeed at first almost ftupified my brain, the
tobacco being green and ftrong, and that I had not
been much ufed to it; then I took fome, and fteeped
it an hour or two in fome rum, and refolved to take
adofe of it when I lay down ; and lastly, I burnt fome
upon a pan of coals, and held my nofe clofe over
the smoke of it, as long as I could bear it, as well
for
for the heat as the virtue of it, and I held almost to suffocation. In the interval of this operation I took up the
bible, and began to read; but my head was too
much difturbed with the tobacco to bear reading, at
leaft at that time; only" having opened the book
cafually, the firft words that occurred to me were
thefe, Ciill on mf inthe day of trouble, and I'lldeliver, and thwfialt glorify me.
The words were very apt to my cafe, and made
fome impression upon my thoughts at the time of
reading theory though not fo much as they did
afterwards; sor as for being delivered, the word
had no found, as Imay fay, to me; the thing was fo
remote, fo impoffible in my apprehenfion of things,
that I began to fay as the children of Ifrael did,
when they were promifed flesh to eat, Can Godfprcad
a table in the wilderness? So I began to fay, Can GOD
himfelf deliver me from this place? And as it was
not for many years that any hope appeared, this
prevailed very often upon my thoughts: but, how-
ever, the words made a very great impression upon
me, and I mufed upon them very often. It grew now
late, and the tobacco had, as I faid, dozed my head
fo much, that I inclined to sleep ; fo that I left my
lamp burning in the cave, left I would want any
thing in the night, and went to bed; but before I
lay down, I did what I never had done in all my
life: I kneeled down and prayed to GOD to fulfil
the promife to me, that if I called upon him in the
day of trouble, he would deliver me: after my
broken and imperfect prayer was over, I drank the
rum in which I had steeped the tobacco, which was
fo
fo strong and rank of the tobacco, that indeed I could
"fcarce get it down. Immediately upon this I went
to bed, and I found prefently it flew up into my
head violently; but I fell into a found sleep, and
waked no more, till by the fun it muft neceflarily be
near three o'clock in the afternoon the next day ; nay,
to this hour I am partly of the opinion, that I flept
all the next day and night, and till almoft three the
day after; for otherwife I knew not how I fhould
lofe a day out of my reckoning in the days of the
week, as it appeared fome years after I had done;
for if I had loft it by croffing and recrossing the
line, I would have loft more than 'a day; but in
my account it was loft, and I never knew which way. .
Be that however one way or other, when I
awaked, I found myfelf exceedingly refrefhed, and
my fpirits lively and chearful; when I got up, I
was stronger than I was the day before, and my
stomach better; for I was hungry; and, in fhort,
I had no fit the next day, but continued much
altered for the better: this was the 2gth.
The 3oth was my well day of courfe, and I went
abroad with my gun, but did not care to travel too
far: I killed a fea-fowl or two, fomething like a
brand goofe, and brought them home, but was not
very forward to eat them: fo I eat fome more of
the turtle's eggs, which were very good: this
evening I renewed the medicine which I had fup-
pofed did me good the day before, viz. the tobacco
steeped in rum; only I did not take fo much as
before, nor did I chew any of the leaf, or hold my
head over the smoke ; however, I was not fo well
the next day, which was the gift of July, as I hoped
I 4 J fhould
I would have been; for I had a little fpice of the
cold fit, but it was not much.
"July 2. I renewed the medicine all the three
ways, and dozed myfelf with it at first, and doubled
the quantity which I drank.
yuly 3. I miffed the fit for good and all, though I
did not recover my full strength for fome weeks
after. While I was thus gathering strength, my
thoughts ran exceedingly upon this fcripture, I will
deliver thee; and the impombiiity of my deliverance
lay much upon my mind, HV..bar of my ever
expecting it: but as I was difcour'aging myfelf with
fuch thoughts, it occurred to my mind, that I pored
fo much upon my deliverence from the main
affliction, that I difregarded the deliverance I had
received; and I was, as it were, made to ask myfelf
fuch queftionsas thefe; viz. Have I not been delivered,
and wonderfully too, from ficknefs? from the moft
diftreffed condition that could be, and that was fo
frightful to me? and what notice had I taken of it?
had I done my part? God had delivered me: but I
had not glorified him: that is to fay, I had not owned
and been thankful for that as a deliverance; and how
could I expect greater deliverance?
This touched my heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneeled down, and gave GOD thanks aloud,
for 'my recovery from my ficknefs.
yuly 4. In the morning I took the bible; and, be-
ginning at the New Teftament, I began seriously to
read it, and impofed upon myfelf to read a-while
every morning and every night, not tying myfelf to
the number of chapters, but as long as my thoughts
would engage me: it was^not long after I fet ferioufly
to this work, but I found my heart more deeply and
fmcerely
fincerely affected with the wickednefs of my paft life;
the impreffion of my dream revived, and the words,
All thesethings have not brought theeto repentance,
ran ferioufly in my thoughts : I was earneftly begging
of GOD to give me repentance, when it happened
providentially the very day, that, reading the fcrip-
ture, I came to thefe words, He is exalted a Prince,
and a Saviour, to give repentance, and to give remljjion:
I threw down the book, and with my heart as well
as my hand lifted up to heaven, in a kind of exO afy of
joy, I cried out aloud, jefas, tboufon gfDavid, 'Jtfus,
thouexalted Prince and Saviour, give me repentance /
This was the firft time that I could fay in the true
fenfe of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for
now I prayed with a fenfe of my condition, and with
a true fcripture view of hope, founded on the
encouragement of the word of GOD; and from this
time, I may fay, I began to have hope that GOD
would hear me.
Now I began to construe the words mentioned
above, Call on me, and I will deliver thee,in a
different fenfe from what I had ever done before; for
then I had no notion of any thing being called
deliverance, but my being delivered from the cap-
tivity I was in; for though I was indeed at large in
the place, yet the ifland was certainly a prifon to me,
and that in the words fenfe in the world; but now I
learned to take it in another fenfe. Now I looked
back upon my pail life with fuch horror, and my
fins appeared fo dreadful, that my foul fought nothing
of GOD, but deliverance from the load of guilt that
bore down all my comfort. As for my folitary life,
it was nothing; I did not fo much as pray to be deli-
vered
vered from it, or think of it; it was all of no
confideration in companfon of this ; and I added
this part here, to hint to whoever mall read it, that
whenever they come to a true fenfe of things, they
will find deliverance from fm a much greater bleffing
than diliverance from affliction. But, leaving this part, I return to my journal.
My condition began now to be, though not lefs mi-
ferable as to my way of living, yet much eafier to my
mind; and my thoughts being directed, by a con-
ftant reading the fcripture, and praying to GOD, to
things of a higher nature, I had a great deal of
comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of:
alfo as my health and ftrength returned, I beftirred
myfelf tofurnifh myfelf with every thing that I wanted,
and make my way of living as regular as I could.
From the 4th of yuly to the I4th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my gun in my hand
a little and a little at a time, as a man that was
gathering up his ftrength after a fit of ficknefs; for
it is hardly to be imagined how low I was, and to
what weaknefs I was reduced. The application
which I made ufe of was perfectly new, and per-
haps what had never cured an ague before; neither
can I recommend it to any one to practice by this
experiment; and though it did carry off the fit, yet
it rather contributed to weaken me; for I had
frequent convulfions in my nerves and limbs for
fome time. ,-/>.,.
I learnt from it alfo this in particular, that being
abroad in the rainy feafon was the moft pernicious
thing
thing to my health that could be, efpecially in thofe
rains which came attended with storms and hurri-
canes of wind; for as the rain which came in a dry
feafon was always mofc accompanied with Rich ftorms,
fo I found this rain was much more dangerous than
the rain which fell in September and Oflober.
I had been now in this unhappy ifland above ten
months; all poffibility of deliverance from this con-
dition feemed to be entirely taken from me; and I
firmly believed that no human fhape had ever fet
foot upon that place. Having now fecured my
habitation, as I thought, fully to my mind, I had a
great defire to make a more perfect difcovery of the
ifland, and to fee what other productions I might
find, which yet I knew nothing of.
It was the 15th of July that I began to take a more
particular furvey of the ifland itfelf; I went up the
creek firft, where, as I hinted, I brought my rafts on
fhore. I found, after I came about two miles up,
that the tide did not flow any higher, and that it was
no more than a little brook of running water, and
very frefh and good; but this being the dry feafon,
there was hardly any water in fome parts of it, at
leaft not. enough to run into any ftream, fo as it
- could be perceived.
On the bank of this brook I found many pleafant
favanna's or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered
with grafs; and on the rifing parts of them next to
the higher grounds, where the water, as it might be
fuppofed, never overflowed, I found a great deal of
-tobacco, green, and growing to a great and very
strong stalk : there were divers other plants which I
had no notion of, or underftanding about; and
might
might perhaps have virtues of their own, which I
could not find out.
I fearched for the cafiave root, which the Indians
in all that climate make their bread of, but I could
find none. I faw large plants of aloes, but did not
then underftand them: I law feveral fugar canes, but
wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I
contented myfelf with thefe difcoveries for this time,
and came back mufmg with myfelf what courfe I
might take to know the virtue and goodnefs of any of
'the fruits or plants which I should difcover, but could
bring it to no conclufion; for, in fhort, I had made
fo little obfervation while I was in the Brafds, that I
knew little of the plants of the field, at leaf t very
little that might ferve me to any purpofe now in my
dillrefs.
The next day, the i6th, I went up the fame way
again; and, after going something farther than I had
done the day before, I found the brook and the
favanna's began to ceafe, and the country became
more woody than before. In this part I found
different fruits, and particularly I found melons upon
the ground in great abundance, and grapes upon the
trees; the vines had fpread indeed over the trees,
and the clusters of grapes were just now in their
prime, very ripe and rich. This was a furprifmg
difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of them, but I
was warned by my experience to eat fparingly of them,
remembering, then when I was afhore in Barbary.,
the eating of grapes killed feveral of our Englifnmcn
who were Haves there, by throwing them into fluxes
and fevers: but I found an excellent ufe for thefe
grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the fun,
and
and keep them as dried grapes or raisins are kept,
which I thought would be, as indeed they were, as
wholefome, and as agreeable to eat, when no grapes
might be had.
I fpent all that evening there, and went not back
to my habitation, which by the way was the first night, as I might fay, I had lain from home. In the
night I took my firft contrivance, and got up into a
tree, where I flept well, and the next morning pro-
ceeded upon my difcovery, travelling near four miles,
as I might judge by the length of the valley, keeping
ftill due north, with a ridge of hills on the fouth and
north fide of me.
At the end of this march I came to an opening,
where the country feemed to defcend to the weft;
and a little fpring of frefh water, which iffued out of
the fide of the hill by me, ran the other way, that is,
due Eaft ; and the country appeared fo frefh, fo green,
fo flouriming, every thing being in a constant verdure
or flourish of fpring, that it looked like a planted
garden.
I defcended a little on the fide of that delicious
valley, furveying it with a fecret kind of pleafure
(though mixed with other afflicting thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was king and
lord of all this country indefeafibly, and had a right
of pofleffion; and if I could convey it, I might have
it in inheritance, as completely as any lord of a
manor in England.' I faw here abundance of cocoa-
trees, orange and lemon, and citron-trees, but all
wild, and few bearing any fruit; at leaft, not then:
however, the green limes that I gathered were not
only pleafant to eat, but very wholefome; and I
mixed
mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made
it very wholefome, and very cool and refrefhing.
I found now I had bufmefs enough to gather and
carry home; and refolved to lay up a ftore, as well
of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnifh myfelf for
the wet feafon, which I knew was approaching.
In order to do this I gathered a great heap of
grapes in one place, and a lefler heap in another
place, and a great parcel of limes and lemons in
another place; and taking a few of each with me, I
travelled homeward, and refolved to come again, and
bring a bag or fack, or what I could make, to carry
the reft home.
Accordingly, having fpent three days in this
journey, I came home (fo I muft now call my tent,
and my cave ;) but before I got thither, the grapes
were fpoiled; the richnefs of the fruit, and the
weight of the juice, having broken them, and bruifed
them, they were good for little or nothing; as to the
limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.
The next day, being the i gth, I went back, hav-
ing made me two fmall bags to bring home my
harvest : But I was furprifed, when coming to my
heap of grapes, which were fo rich and fine when I
gathered them, I found them all fpread abroad, trod
to pieces, and dragged about, fome here, fome there,
and abundance eaten and devoured: By this I con-
cluded there were fome wild creatures thereabouts,
which had done this; but what they were I knew
not.
However, as I found there was no laying them up
on heaps, and no carrying them away in a fack, but
that one way they would be destroyed, and the other
way
•way they would be crufhed with their own weight, I
took another courfe; for I gathered a large quantity
of the grapes, and hung them upon the out branches
of the trees, that they might cure and dry in the fun;
and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many
back as I could well fland under*
When I came home from this journey, I contem-
plated with great pleafure on the fruitfulnefs of that
valley, and the pleafantnefs of the ntuation,the fecurity
from ftorms on that fide of the water, and the wood;
and concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix
my abode which was by far the worst part of the
country. Upon the whole, I began to confider of
removing my habitation, and to look out for a place
equally fafe as where I now was fituated, if possible, in that pleafant fruitful part of the ifland.
This thought ran long in my head, and I was
exceeding fond of it for fome time, the pleafantnefs
of the place tempting me; but when I came to a
nearer view of it, and to confider that I was now by
the fea fide, where it was at leaft poffible that forms thing might happen to my advantage, and that the
fame ill fate that brought me hither might bring
fome other unhappy wretches to the fame place; and
though it was fcarce probable that any fuch thing
should ever happen, yet to inclofe myfelf among the
hills and woods, in the centre of the ifland,. was to
anticipate my bondage, and to render fuch an affair
not only improbable, but impoffible; and that there-
fore I ought not by any means to remove.
However, I was fo enamoured with this place, that
I fpent much of my time there for the whole remain-
ing part of the month of July / and though, upon
'fecond
fecond thoughts I refolved as above, not to remove,
yet I built me a little kind of a bower, and furrounded
it at a diftance with a strong fence, being a double
hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and
filled between with brufhwood; and here I lay very
fecure, fometimes two or three nights together,
always going over it with a ladder, as before; fo that I
fancied now I had my country houfe, and my feacoaft
houfe: and this work took me up the beginning of
August.I had but newly finished my fence, and began to
enjoy my labour, but the rains came on, and made
me ftick clofe to my first habitation; for though I
had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a
fail, andfpread it very well, yet I had not the shelter "of an hill to keep me from storms, nor a cave behind
me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.
About the beginning 'of August,as I faid, I had
finished my bower, and began to enjoy myfelf. The
third of AugustI found the grapes I had hung up
were perfectly dried, and indeed were excellent good
raisins of the fun; fo I began to take them down
from the trees, and it was very happy that I did fo;
for the rains which followed would have fpoiled them,
and I had loft the beft part of my winter food; for I
had above two hundred large bunches of them. No
fooner had I taken them all down, and carried moft
of them home to my cave, but it began to rain; and
from thence, which was the fourteenth of August,it
rained more or lefs every day, till the middle of
Oflobcr; and fometimes fo violently, that I could not
ftir out of my cave for feveral days.
In this feafon I was much furprifed with the increase of my family: I had been concerned for, the lofs of
one
one of my cats, who ran away from me, or, as I
thought, had been dead; and I heard no more tale
or tidings of her, till to my aflonifhment me came
home about the end of August,with three kittens.
This was the more ftrange to me, becaufe though I
had killed a wild cat, as I called it, with my gun,
yet I thought it was a quite different kind from our
European cats'; yet the young cats were the fame
kind of houfe breed like the old one; and both my
cats being females, I thought it very strange : but
from thefe three cats, I afterwards came to be fo
peftered with cats, that I was forced to kill them like
vermin, or wild beafts, and to drive them from my
houfe as much as poffible.
From the fourteenth of Augustto the twenty-fixth,
inceffant rain, fo that I could not ftir, and was now *
very careful not to be much wet. In this confinement
I began to be ftraightened for food; but venturing
out twice, I one day killed a goat: and the laft day,
which was the twenty-fixth, found a very large
tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was
regulated thus: I eat a bunch of raifins for my
breakfaft, a piece of the goats flefa, or of the turtle,
for my dinner, broiled (for to my great misfortune I
had no vessel to boil or ftew any thing ;) and two or
three of the turtle's eggs for fupper.
During this confinement in my cover by the rain,
I worked daily two or three hours at enlarging my
cave; and, by degrees, worked it on towards one
fide, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made
a door or way out, which came beyond my fence or
wall; and fo I came in and out this way: but I was
not perfectly eafy at laying fo open; for as I had.
VOL. I. K managed
managed myfelf before, I was in a perfect mclofurey
whereas now I thought I lay expofed; and yet I
could not perceive that there was any living. thing
to fear, the biggeft creature that I had feen upon the
island being a goat.
• September the thirtieth. I was now come to the
unhappy anniverfary of my landing: I caft up the
notches on my poft, and found I had been on more
three hundred and fixty-five days. I kept this day
as a folemn faft, fetting it apart to a religious exer-
cife, proftrating myfelf to the ground with the mofl
ferious humiliation, confeffing myfelf to God, ac-
knowledging his righteous judgment upon me, and
praying to him to have mercy on me, through Jefus
Chrift; and having not tafted the leaft refreshment for twelve hours, even till the going down of the fun,
I then eat a bifcuit-cake, and a bunch of grapes, and
went to bed, finifhing the day as I began it.
I had all this time obferved no fabbath-day; for as
at firft I had no fenfe of religion upon my mind, I
had after fome time omitted to distinguish the weeks,
by making a longer notch than ordinary for the
fabbath-day, and fo did not really know what any of
the days were; but now, having caft up the days as
above, I found I had been there a year; fo I divided
it into weeks, and fet apart every feventh day fora
fabbath; though I found at the end of my account I
had loft a day or two of my reckoning.
A little after this my ink began to fail me, and
fo I contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingly, and to
write down only the moft remarkable events of my
life, without continuing a daily memorandum of
other things.
The
The rainy feafon, and the dry feafon, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learned to divide them
fo as to provide for them accordingly. But I bought
all my experience before I had it; and this I am
going to relate, was one of the moft difcouraging
experiments that I made at all. I have mentioned, that I had faved the few ears of barley and rice which
I had fo furprifingly found fpring up, as I thought,
of themfelves, and believe there were about thirty
ftalks of rice, and about twenty of barley; and now
I thought it a proper time to fow it after the rains, the
fun being in its fouthern position going from me.
Accordingly I dug up a piece of ground, as well
as I could, with my wooden fpade, and dividing it
into two parts, I fowed my grain; but as I was fow-
ing, it cafually occurred to my thought, that I would
not fow it all at first, becaufe I did not know when was the proper time for it; fo I fowed about two
thirds of the feeds, leaving about an handful of each.
It was a great comfort to me afterwards that I did
fo, for not one grain of that I fowed this time came
to any thing; for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the feed was fown, it had
no moifture to affift its growth, and never came up
at all, till the wet feafon had come again, and then
it grew as if it had been newly fown.
Finding my firft feed did not grow, which I eafily'
imagined was by the drought, I fought for a moifter
piece of ground to make another trial in; and I dug
up a piece of ground near my new bower, and fowed
the reft of my feed in February, a little before the
vernal equinox; and this, having the rainy months
of March and April to water it, fprung up very plea-
K 2 fantly
fantly, and yielded a very good crop; but having part of the feed left only, and not daring to fow all
that I had yet, I had but a small quantity at laft, my
whole crop not amounting to above half a peck of
each kind.
But by this experience I was made mafter of my
bufinefs, and knew exactly when the proper feafon
was to fow; and that I might expect two feed times,
and two harvests every year.
While this corn was growing, I made a little dif-
covery, which was of ufe to me afterwards: As foon<
as the rains were over, and the weather began to
fettle, which was about the month of November, I
made a vifit up the country to my bower, where
though I had not been fome months, yet I found all
things juft as I left them. The circle or double hedge
that I had made, was not only firm and entire, but
the flakes which I had cut off of fome trees that grew
thereabouts, were all mot out, and grown with long
branches, as much as a willow tree ufually moots the
firft year after lopping its head. I could not tell
what tree to call it that thefe flakes were cut from,
I was furprifed, and yet very well pleafed, to fee the
young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them
up to grow as much alike as I could;. and it is fcarce
credible, how beautiful a figure they grew into in
three years; fo that though the hedge made a circle of about twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees,
for fuch I might now call them, soon- covered it,
and it was a complete fhade, fufficient to lodge under
all the dry season- This made me resolve to cut fome more flakes,
and make me an hedge like this in a femicircle round
my
my wall, I mean that of my firft dwelling, which I
did; and placing the trees or ftakes in a double row,
at above eight yards distance from my first fence; they
grew prefently, and were at firft a fine cover to my
habitation, and afterwards ferved for a defence alfo,
as I fhall obferve in its order.
I found now, that the feafons of the year might
generally be divided, not into fummer and winter, as
in Europe, but into the rainy feafons, and the dry
seasons, which were generally thus:

The rainy feafon fometimes held longer or fhorter,
as the winds happened to blow; but this was the
general observation I made. After I had found, by
experience, the ill confequence of being abroad in
the rain, I took care to furnifh myfelfwith provifion
beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out;
K3
and I fat within doors as much as possible during the
wet months.
In this time I found much employment (and very
fuitable alfo to the time) for I found great occafion
of many things which I had no way to furrdfh myfclf
with, but by hard labour, and constant application;
particularly, I tried many ways to make myfelf a
bafket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpofe
proved fo brittle, that they would do nothing. It
proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when
I was a boy, I ufed to take great delight in (landing
at a bafket-maker's in the town where my father lived,
to fee them make their wicker ware; and being, as
boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a great
obferver of the manner how they worked thofe things,
and fometimes lent an hand, I had by this means fo
full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted
nothing but the materials; when it came into my
mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut
my ftakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as
the fallows and willows, and ofiers, in England;
and I refolved to try.
Accordingly the next day I went to my country- house, as I called it, and cutting fome of the finaller
twigs, I found them to my purpofe as much as I
could defire; whereupon I came the next time pre-
pared with an hatchet to cut down a quantity, which
I soon found, for there was a great plenty of them:
thefe I fet up to dry within my circle or hedges; and
when they were fit for ufe, I carried them to my
cave; and here during the next feafon I employed
myfelf in making, (as well as I could) a great many
bafkets, both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up
any
any thing, as I had occafion; and though I did not
finifh them very handfomely, yet I made them
fufficiently ferviceable for my purpofe; and thus
afterwards I took care never to be without them;
and as my wicker-ware decayed I made more; efpe-
cially I made ftrong deep baskets to place my corn
in, inftead of facks, when I should come to have
any quantity of it,
Having maftered this difficulty, and employed a
world of time about it, I beftirred myfelf to fee, if
poffible, how to fupply two wants. I had no veflels
to hold any thing that was liquid, except two rundlets,
which were almoft full of rum, and fome glafs bottles,
fome of the common fize, and others which were
cafebottles fquare, for the holding of waters, fpirits,
&c. I had not fo much as a pot to boil any thing in,
except a great kettle which I faved out of the fhip,
and which was too big for fuch ufes as I defired it
for, viz. to make broth, and flew a bit of meat by
itfelf. The fecond thing I would fain have had, was
a tobacco pipe, but it was impoffible for me to make
one; however, I found a contrivance for that too
at laft.
I employed myfelf in planting my fecond rows of
stakes of piles, and in this wicker work, all the
fummer, or dry feafon; when another bufinefs took
me up more time than it could be imagined I could
fpare.
I mentioned before, that I had a great mind to fee
the whole ifland, and that I had travelled up the brook,
and fo on to where I built my bower, and where I
had an opening quite to-the fea, on the other fide of
the island. I now refolved to travel quite acrofs to
K 4 the
the tea more on that fide: So taking my gun, and
hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of powder
and fhot than ufual, with two bifcuit-cakes, and a
great bunch of raifins in my pouch, for my ftore, I
began my journey. When I had paired the vale
where my bower flood, as above, I came within
view of the fea., to the weft; and it being a very clear
day, I fairly defcried land, whether an ifland or con-
tinent I could not tell; but it lay very high, extend-
ing from the weft, to the W. S. W. at a very great
diftance; by my guefs it could not be lefs than fifteen
or twenty leagues off.
I could not tell what part of the world this might
be, otherwife than that I knew it must be part of
America; and, as I concluded by all my obfervations,
muft be near the Spanishdominions, and perhaps
was all inhabited by favages, where if I would have landed, I had been in a worfe condition than I
was now; and therefore I acquiefced in the difpofi-
tions of Providence, which I began now to own, and
to believe, ordered every thing for the belt ; I fay,
I quieted my mind with this, and left afflicting my-
felf with fruitlefs wifhes of being there.
Befides, after fome paufe upon this affair, I con-
fidered, that if this land was the. Spanishcoaft, I
would certainly, one time or other, fee fome veffefif'
pafs or repafs one way or other; but if not, then it
was the favage coaft betwen the Spanishcountry and
Bfafil, which were indeed the worft of favages; for
they are canibals, or men-eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall
into their hands.
With
"With thefe confiderations I walked very leisurely forward. I found that fide of the ifland where I now
was, much pleafanter than mine, the open or favanna
fields fweet, adorned with flowers and grafs, and
full of very fine woods. I faw abundance of parrots,
and fain would I have caught one, if possible, to
have kept it to be tame, and taught it to fpeak to
me. I did, after fome pains taking, catch a young
parrot; for I knocked it down with a flick, and
having recovered it, I brought it home, but it was
fome years before I could make him fpeak. However,
at laft I taught him to call me by my name very
familiarly: but the accident that followed, though
it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.
I was exceedingly diverted with this journey: I
found in the low grounds, hares, as I thought them
to be, and foxes, but they differed greatly from all
the other kinds I had met with; nor could I fatisfy
myfelf to eat them, though I killed feveral: but I
had no need to be venturous; for I had no want of
food, and of that which was very good too; efpe-
cially thefe three forts, viz. goats, pigeons, and
turtle or tortoife; which, added to my grapes,
Leadenhall market could not have furnifhed a better
table than I, in proportion to the company: and
"though my cafe was deplorable enough, yet I had
great caufe for thankfulnefs, that I was not driven
to any extremities for food ; but rather plenty, even
to dainties.
I never travelled in this journey above two miles
outright in a day, or thereabouts; but I took fo
many turns and returns, to fee what difcoveries I could
make, that I came weary enough to the place where
I refolved
I refolved to fit down for all night; and then either
repofed myfelf in a tree, or furrounded myfelf with
a row of stakes fet upright in the ground, either from
one tree to another, or fo as no wild creature could
come at me without waking me.
As foon as I came to the fea-fhore, I was furprifed
to fee that I had taken up my lot on the worft fide of
the ifland; for here indeed the more was covered
with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other fide
I had found but three in a year and an half. Here
was alfo an infinite number of fowls of many kinds,
fome of which I had not feen before, and many of
them very good meat; but fuch as I knew not the
names of, except thofe called penguins.
I could have fhot as many as I pleafed, but was
very fparing of my powder and fhot: and therefore
had more mind to kill a fhe-goat, if I could, which
I could better feed on: and though there were many
goats here more than on the other fide of the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I could come
near them; the country being flat and even, and
they faw me much fooner than when I was on the
hills.
I confefs this fide of the country was much plea-
fanter than mine, but yet I had not the leaft inclina-^.-"
tion to remove; for as I was fixed in my habitation,
it became natural to me, and I feemed all the while
I was here to be, as it were, upon a journey, and
from home: however, I travelled along the more of
the fea towards the east, I fuppofe, about twelve
miles; and then fetting up a great pole upon the
shore for a mark, I concluded I would go home
again; and the next journey I took fhould be on
the
the other fide of the ifland, eaft from my dwelling,
and fo round, till I c?.me to my post again: of which
in its place.
I took another way to come back than that I went,
thinking I could eafily keep all the ifland fo much
in my view, that I could not mifs finding my first dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myfelf
miftaken; for being come about two or three miles,
I found myfelf defcended into a very large valley;
but fo furrounded with hills, and thofe hills covered
with woods, that I could not fee which was my way
by any direction but that of the fun; nor even then,
unlefs I knew very well the pofition of the fun at that
time of the day.
It happened, to my farther misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days, while I
was in this valley; and not being able to fee the fun,
I wandered about very uncomfortably, and at lad
was obliged to find out the fea-fide, look for my port,
and come back the fame way I went; and then by
eafy journies I turned homeward, the weather being
exceeding hot; and my gun, ammunition, hatchet,
and other things, very heavy.
In this journey my dog furprifed a young kid, and
seized upon it; and I running in to take hold of it,
caught it, and faved it alive from the dog: I had a
great mind to bring it home, if I could; for I had
often been mufing whether it might not be poffible
to get a kid or two, and fo raife a breed of tame
goats, which might fupply me when my powder and
hot fhould be fpent.
I made a collar for this little creature, and with a
firing which I made of feme rope yarn, which I
always
always carried about me, I led him along, though
with fome difficulty, till I came to my bower, and
there I enclofed him, and left him; for I was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
abfent above a month.
I cannot exprefs what a fatisfa&ion it was to me
to come into my old hutch, and lie down in my
hammock-bed: this little wandering journey, without
a fettled place of abode, had been fo unpleafant to
me, that my own houfe, as I called it to myfelf,
was a perfect fettlement to me, compared to that;
and it rendered every thing about me fo comfortable,
that I refolved I would never go a great way from
it again, while it would be my lot to ftay on the
ifland.
I repofed myfelf here a week, to reft and regale
myfelf after my long journey; during which, mof
t
of the time was taken up in the weighty affair of
making a cage for my poll, who began now to be a
mere domestic, and to be mighty well acquainted
with me. Then I began to think of the poor kid,
which I had pent in within my little circle, and
refolved to go and fetch it home, and give it fome
food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left
it; for indeed it could not get out, but was almost ftarved for want of food; I went and cut boughs of
trees and branches of fuch fhrubs as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I
did before, to lead it away; but it was fo tame with
being hungry, that I had no need to have tied it;
for it followed me like a dog; and as I continually
fed it, the creature became fo loving, fo gentle,
and fo fond, that it became from that time one
of,
of my domeftics alfo, and would never leave me
afterwards.
The rainy feafon of the Autumnal Equinox was
now come, and I kept the 3oth of September in the
fame folemn manner as before, being the anniverfary
of my landing on the ifland, having now been there
two years, and no more prospect of being delivered
than the first day I came there. I fpent the whole
day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the
many wonderful mercies which my folitary condition
was attended with, and without which it might h ave
been infinitely more miferable. I gave humble and
hearty thanks, that GOD had been pleafed to difcover
to me even that it was poffible I might be more
happy in this folitary condition than I fhould have
been in a liberty of fociety, and in all the pleafures
of the world: that he could fully make up to me the
deficiencies of my folitary state, and the want of
human fociety, by his prefence, and the communi-
cation of his grace to my foul, fupporting, com-
forting, and encouraging me to depend upon his
providence here, and hope for his eternal prefence
hereafter.
It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how much
more happy the life I now led was, with all its
miferable circumftances, than the wicked, curfed,
abominable life I led all the paft part of my days;
and now, having changed both my forrows and my
joys, my very desires altered, my affections changed
their gift, and my delights were perfectly new from
what they were at first coming, or indeed for the
two years paft.
But
-
Before as I walked about, either on my hunting1,
or for viewing the country, the anguish of my foul
at my condition would break out upon me on a
fudden, and my very heart would die within me, to
think of the woods, the mountains, the defarts I was
in; and how I was a prifoner, locked up with the
eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited
wildernefs, without redemption. In the midfl of
the greateft compofures of my mind, this would
break out upon me like a ftorm, and made me wring
my hands, and weep like a child. Sometimes it
would take me in the middle of my work, and I
would immediately fit down and figh, and look
upon the ground for. an hour or two together, and
this was still worfe to me; for if I could burst out
into tears, or vent myfelf by words, it would go
off, and the grief, having exhausted itfelf, would
abate.
But now I began to exercife myfelf with new
thoughts; I daily read the word of GOD, and applied
all the comforts of it to my prefent late. One
morning, being very fad, I opened the bible upon thefe words, I will never, never leave thee, nor
ferfake thee! Immediately it occurred, that thefe
words were to me , why elle would they be directed
in fuch a manner, juft at the moment when I was
mourning, over my condition, as one forfaken of
GOD and man? Well then, faid I, if GOD does not
forfake me, of what ill confequence can it be, or
what matters it, though the world should all forfake
me; feeing, on the other hand, if I had all the
world, and mould lofe the favour and bleffing of
GOO, there would be no comparison in the lofs?
From
From this moment I began to conclude in my
mind, that it was possible for me to be more happy
in this forfaken, folitary condition, than it was
probable I would have ever been in any other par-
ticular ftate in the world; and with this thought I
was going to give thanks to GOD for bringing me to
this place.
I know not what it was, but fomething mocked
my mind at that thought, and I durft not fpeak the
words: how canft thou be fuch an hypocrite (faid I,
even audibly), to pretend to be thankful for a con-
dition, which, however thou mayft endeavour to be
contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to
be delivered from? So I ftopped there; but though
I could not fay I thanked GOD for being there, yet
I fincerely gave thanks to GOD for opening my eyes>
by whatever afflicting providences, to fee the former
condition of my life, and to mourn for my wickednefs,
and repent. I never opened the bible, or fhut it,
but my very foul within me blefled GOD for directing
my friend in England, without any order of mine,
to pack it up among my goods; and for affifting
me afterwards to fave it out of the wreck of
the fhip.
Thus, and in this difpofition of mind, I began
my third year; and though I have not given the
reader the trouble of fo particular an account of my
works this year as at the full, yet in general it may
be obferved, that I was very feldom idle; having
regularly divided my time, according to the feveral
daily employments that were before me; fuch as,
first, my duty to GOD, and reading the fcriptures,
which I conftantly fet apart fome time for, thrice
every
every day. Secondly, the going abroad with my
gun for food, which generally took me up three
hours every morning when it did not rain.
Thirdly, the ordering, curing, preferving, and
cooking what I had killed or catched for my
fupply; thefe took up great part of the day: alfo it
is to be confidered, that in the middle of the day,
when the fun was in the zenith, the violence of the
heat was too great to ftir out; fo that about four
hours in the evening was all the time I could be
fuppofed to work in; with this exception, that
fometimes I changed my hours of hunting and
working, and went to work in the morning, and
abroad with my gun in the afternoon.
To this short time allowed for labour, I defire
may be added the exceeding laborioufnefs of my
work; the many hours, which for want of tools,
want of help, and want of fkill, every thing that I
did took up, out of my time: for example, I was
full two-and-forty days making me a board for a
long fhelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas two
fawyers, with their tools and faw-pit, would have cut
fix of them out of the fame tree in half a day.
My cafe was this: It was to be a large tree which
was to be cut down, becaufe my board was to be a
broad one. The tree I was three days a cutting
down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and
reducing it to a log, or piece of timber. With
inexpreffible hacking and hewing I reduced both the
fides of it into chips, till it began to be light enough
to move; then I turned it, and made one fide of it
smooth and flat, as a board, from end to end: then,
turning that fide downward, cut the other fide till I
brought
brought the plank to be about three inches thick,
and finooth on both fides. Any one may judge the
labour of my hands in fuch a piece of work; but
labour and patience carried me through that and
many other things; I only obferve this in particular, to mow the reason why fo much of my time went
away with fo little work, viz. That what might be a
little to be done with help and tools, was a vast labour, and required a prodigious time to do alone,
and by hand.
But notwithslanding this, with patience and
labour, I went through many things, and indeed
every thing that my circumftances made neceflary for
me to do, as will appear by what follows.
I was now in the months of November and Decem-
ber, expecting my crop of barley and rice. The
ground I had manured or dug up for them was not
great; for, as I obferved, my feed of each was not
above the quantity of half a peck; for I had loft one
whole crop by fowing in the dry feafon; but now
my crop promifed very well, when on a fudden I
found I was in danger of lofing it all again by
enemies of feveral forts, which it was fcarce poffible
to keep from it; as firft, the goats, and wild
creatures which I called hares, which, rafting the
fweetnefs of the blade, lay in it night and day, as
foon as it came up, and eat it fo clofe, that it could
get no time to fhoot up into ftalks.
This I faw no remedy for, but by making an
inclofure about it with a hedge, which I did with a
great deal of toil; and the more, becaufe it required
a great deal of fpeed; the creatures daily fpoiling
my corn. However, as my arable land was but
VOL. I. L fmall,
fmall, fuited to my crop, I got it totally well fenced
in about three weeks time, and meeting fome ofthe
creatures in the day-time, I fet my dog to guard it in
the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where
he would stand and bark all night long; fo in a
little time the enemies forfook the place, and the
corn grew very ftrong and well, and began to ripen
apace.
But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn
was in the blade, fo the birds were as likely to ruin
me now, when it was in the ear; for going along
by the place to fee how it throve, I faw my little
crop furrounded with fowls of I know not how many
forts, which flood as it were watching till I fhould be
gone. I immediately let fly among them (for I
always had my gun with me.). I had no fooner
lot, but there arofe up a little cloud of fowls,
which I had not feen at all, from among the corn
itfelf.
This touched me fenfibly; for I forefaw, that in
a few days they would devour all my hopes: that I
should be ftarved, and never be able to raife a crop
at all; and what to do I could not tell: however, I
refolved not to lofe my corn, if poffible, though I
would watch it night and day. In the firfl place,
I went among it to fee what damage was already done,
and found they had fpoiled a good deal of it; but
that, as it was yet too green for them, the lofs was
not fo great, but the remainder was like to be a good
crop, if it could be faved.
I flaid by it to load my gun, and then coming
away, I could eafily fee the thieves fitting upon all
the trees about me, as if they only waited till I was
gone
gone away, and the event proved it to be fo; for as
I walked off as if I was gone, I was no fooner out
of their fight, but they dropped down one by one
into the corn again. I was fo provoked, that I
could not have patience to ftay till more came on,
knowing that every grain that they eat now was, as
it might be faid, a peck loaf to me in the confe-
quence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again,
and killed three of them. This was what I wished for; fo I took them up, and ferved them as we ferve
notorious thieves in England, viz. hanged them in
chains for a terror to others. It is impossible to
imagine almoft, that this would have fuch an
effect as it had; for the fowls would not only not
come at the corn, but in fhort they forfook all that
part of the ifland, and I could never fee a bird near
the place as long as my fcarecrows hung there.
This I was very glad of, you may be fure; and
about the latter end of December, which was our
fecond harveft of the year, I reaped my corn.
I was fadly put to it for a fcythe or a fickle to cut
it down, and all I could do was to make one as well
as I could out of one of the broad fwords, or cutlafles,
which I faved among the arms out of the fhip. How-
ever, as my crop was but fmall, I had no great
difficulty to cut it down: in short, I reaped it my
way, for I cut nothing off but the ears, and carried
it away in a great basket which I had made, and fo
rubbed it out with my hands: and at the end of
all my harvesting I found, that out of my half-
peck of feed, I had near two bufhels of rice,
and above two bufhels and a half of barley, that
L 2 is
is to fay, by my guefs, for I had no meafure at that time.
However, this was a great encouragement to me j.
and I forefaw, that in time it would pleafe GOD tcS-'
fupply me with bread: and yet here I was perplexed
again, for I neither knew how to grind or make
meal of my corn, or indeed how to clean it, and
part it; nor, if made into meal, how to make bread
of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how
to bake it. Thefe things being added to my defire
of having a good quantity for ftore, and to fecure a
constant fupply, I refolved not to taste any of this
crop, but to preferve it all for feed againft the next
feafon, and in the mean time to employ all my ftudy
and hours of working to accomplifh this great work
of providing myfelf with corn and bread.
It might be truly faid, that I now worked for my
bread. It is a little wonderful, and what I believe
few people have thought much upon; viz. the ftrange
multitude of little things neceflary in the providing,
producing, curing, dreffing, making, and finishing, this one article of bread.
I, that was reduced to a mere ftate of , nature,
found this to be my daily difcouragement, and was
made more and more fenfible of it every hour, even
after I got the firft handful of feed corn, which, as I have faid, came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a
furprife.
Firft, I had no plough to turn the earth, no fpade
or fhovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered by
making a wooden fpade, as I obferved before; but
this did my work but in a wooden manner; and
though*
though it coft me a great many days to make it, yet
for want of iron, it not only wore out the fooner,
but made my work the harder, and made it be
performed much worse. However, this I bore with too, and was content to
work it out with patience, and bear with the badnefs
of the performance. When the corn was fowed, I
had no harrow, but was forced to go over it rnyfelf,
and drag a great heavy bough of a tree over it, to
fcratch the earth, as it may be called, rather than
rake or harrow it.
When it was growing or grown, I have observed already how many things I wanted, to fence it,
fccure it, mow or reap it, cure or carry it home,
threfh, part it from the chaff, and fave it. Then I
wanted a mill to grind it, fieves to drefs it, yeaft
and fart to make it into bread, and an oven to bake
it in; and all thefe things I did without, as mail be
obferved; and yet the corn was an inestimable comfort .and advantage to me too; but all this, as
. I faid, made every thing laborious and tedious to
me, but that there was no help for; neither was my
time fo much lofs to me, becaufe I had divided it;
a certain part of it was every day appointed to thefe
works; and as I refolved to ufe none of the corn
for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had
the next fix months to apply myfelf wholly by labour
and invention, to furnish myfelf with utenfils
proper for the performing all the operations necessary for the making the corn, when I had it, fit for
my ufe.
But first I was to prepare more land, for I had
now feed enough to fow above an acre of ground.
L 3 Before
Before I did this, I had a week's work at leaft to
make me a fpade, which, when it was done, was a
very forry one indeed, and very heavy, and required
double labour to work with it; however, I went
through that, and lowed my feeds in two large flat
pieces of ground, as near my houfe as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with a good
hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that wood
which I had fet before, which I knew would grow,
fo that in one year's time I knew I would have a
quick or living hedge, that would want but little
repair. This work was not fo little as to take me
up lefs than three months; becaufe great part of
that time was in the wet feafon, when I could not go
abroad.
Within-door, that is, when it rained, and I could
not go out, I found employment on the following
occafion, always obferving, that all the while I was
at work, I diverted myfelf with talking to my
parrot, and teaching him to fpeak; and I quickly
learnt him to know his own name ; at laft, to fpeak
it out pretty loud, POL; which was the firft word
I ever heard fpoken in the ifland by any mouth but
my own. This therefore was not my work, but an
assistant to my work; for now, as I faid, I had a
great employment upon my hands, as follows: viz.
I had long ftudied, by fome means or other, to make
myfelf fome earthen vessels, which indeed I wanted
forely, but knew not where to come at them: how-
ever, confidering the heat of the climate, I did not
doubt but, if I could find out any fuch clay, I
might botch up fome fuch pot, as might, being
dried by the fun, be hard enough, and strong enough,
enough, to bear handling, and to hold any thing
that was dry, and required to be kept fo; and as
this was necessary in preparing corn, meal, &c.
which was the thing I was upon, I refolved to
make fome as large as I could, and fit only to Rand like jarrs to hold what would be put into them.
I would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh
at me, to tell how many aukward ways I took to
raise this pafte, what odd mif-mapen ugly things I
made, how many of them fell in, and how many
fell out, the clay not being ftiff enough to bear its
own weight; how many cracked by the over-violent
heat of the fun, being fet out too hastily ; and how
many fell to pieces with only removing, as well
before as after they were dried; and, in a word,
how, after having laboured hard to find the clay,
to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work
it, I could not make above two large earthen ugly
things, I cannot call them jarrs, in about two months
labour.
However, as the fun baked thefe two very dry and
hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fet them
down again in two great wicker-bafkets, which I
had made on purpofe for them, that they might not
break; and, as between the pot and the basket there
was a little room to fpare, I ftuffed it full of the
rice and barley straw ; and thefe two pots being
to fland always dry, I thought would hold my dry
corn, and perhaps the meal when the corn was
bruifed.
Though I mifcarried fo much in my defign for
large pots, yet I made feveral smaller things with
better fuccefs } fuch as little round pots, flat dimes,
L 4 pitchers,
pitchers, and pipkins, and any thing my hand
turned to; and the heat of the fun baked theni.
ftrangely hard.
But all this would not anfwer my end, which was
to get an earthen pot to hold what was liquid, and
bear the fire, which none of thefe could do. It
happened after fome time, making a pretty large
fire for cooking my meat, when I went to put it out,
after I had done with it, I found a broken piece of
one of my earthen ware veflels in the fire, burnt as
hard as a clone, and red as a tile. I was agreeably
furprifed to fee it, and faid to myfelf, that certainly
they might be made to burn whole, if they would burn broken.
This fet me to ftudy how to order my fire, fo as to
make it burn me fome pots. I had no notion of a
kiln, fuch as the potters burn in, or of glazing them
with lead, though I had fome lead to do it with ; but
I placed three large pipkins, and two or three pots,
in a pile one upon another, and placed my fire-wood
all round it with a great heap of embers under
them: I plied the fire with frefh fuel round the
outfide, and upon the top, till I faw the pots in the
infide red hot quite through, and obferved that they
did not crack at all: when I faw them clear red, I
let them ftand in that heat about five or fix hours,
• till I found one of them, though it did not crack,
did melt or run; for the fand which was mixed
with the clay melted by the violence of the heat,
and would have run into glafs, if I had gone on;
fo I flacked my fire gradually, till the pots began to
abate of the red colour; and watching them all
night, that I might not let the fire'abate too faft, in
the
the morning I had three very good, I will not fay
handfome pipkins, and two other earthen pots,
as hard burnt as could be defired; and one of
them perfectly glazed with the running of the
fand.
After this experiment I need not fay that I wanted
no fort of earthen-ware for my ufe; but I muft needs
fay, as to the fhapes of them, they were very in-
different, as any one may fuppofe, when I had no
\way of making them, but as the children make dirt-
pies, or as a woman would make pies that never
learnt to raife pafte.
No joy at a thing of fo mean a nature was ever
equal to mine, when I found I had made an earthen
pot that would bear the fire; and I had hardly
patience to stay till they were cold, before I fet one
upon the fire again, with fome water in it, to boil
me fome meat, which I did admirably well; and
with a piece of a kid I made fome very good
broth, though I wanted oatmeal, and feveral other
ingredients requifite to make it fo good as I would
have had it.
My next concern was to get me a Stone mortar to
flamp or beat fome corn in; for as to the mill, there
was no thought of arriving to that perfection of art
with one pair of hands. To fupply this want, I was
at a great lofs ; for of all trades in the world I was
as perfectly unqualified for a ftone-cutter, as for any
whatever; neither had I any tools to go about it
with. I fpent many a day to find out a great ftone
big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar,
and could find none at all, except what was in the
(olid rocky and which I had no way to dig or cut out;
nor
nor indeed were the rocks in the ifland of hardnefs
fufficient, but were all of a fandy crumbling stone, which would neither bear the weight of an heavy
pestle, nor would break the corn without filling it
with fand; fo, after a great deal of time loft in
fearching for a ftone, I gave it over, and refolved to
look out a great block of hard wood, which I found
indeed much eafier; and getting one as big as I had
ftrength to ftir, I rounded it, and formed it on the
outfide with my axe and hatchet; and then with the
help of fire and infinite labour, made an hollow
place in it, as the Indians in Brafil make their
canoes. After this, I made a great heavy peftle or
beater, of the wood called the iron-wood, and this I
prepared and laid by againft I had my next crop of
corn, when I propofed to myfelf to grind, or rather
pound, my corn or meal to make my bread.
My next difficulty was to make a fieve or fierce, to
drefs my meal, and part it from the bran and the hulk, without which I did not fee it possible I could have
any bread. This was a most difficult thing, fo much
as but to think on; for to be fure I had nothing like
the necessary things to make it with; I mean fine
thin canvafs, or ftuff, to fierce the meal through.
And here I was at a full ftop for many months; nor
did I really know what to do; linen I had none left but
what was mere rags; I had goat's hair, but neither
knew I how to weave or fpin it; and had I known
how, here were no tools to work it with; all the
remedy that I found for this, was, that at laft I did
remember I had among the feamen's clothes which
were faved out of the fhip, fome neckcloths of callico
or muffin; and with fome pieces of thgfe I made
three
three finall fieves, but proper enough for the work ;
and thus I made fhift for forae years; how I did
afterwards, I mall fhevv in its place.
The baking part was thenext thing to be confidered,
and how I fhould make bread when I came to have
corn; for, firft, I had no yeast : as to that part,
there was no fupplying the want, fo I did not con-
cern myfelf much about it. But for an oven, I was
indeed in great pain. At length I found out an
experiment for that also, which was this; I made
fome earthen vessels very broad, but not deep; that
is to fay, about two feet diameter, and not above
nine inches deep; thefe I burnt in the fire, as I had
done the other, and laid them by; and when I'wanted
to bake, I made a great fire upon the hearth, which
I had paved with fome fquare tiles of my own making
and burning alfo; but I fhould not call them fquare.
When the fire-wood was burnt pretty much into
embers, or live coals, I drew them forward upon
this hearth, fo as to cover it all over; and there I let
them lie, till the hearth was very hot; then fweeping
away all the embers, I fet down my loaf, or
loaves; and whelming down the earthen pot upon
them, drew the embers all round the outfide of the
pot, to keep in, and add to the heat; and thus, as
well as in the beft oven in the world, I baked my
barley-loaves, and became in a little time a mere
paftry-cook into the bargain; for I made myfelf
feveral cakes of the rice, and puddings; indeed I
made no pies, neither had I any thing to put into
them, fuppofing I had, except the flesh either of
fowls or goats.
It
It need not be wondered at, if all thefe things took.
me up most part of the third year of my abode here;
for it is to be obferved, that in the intervals of thefe
things, I had my new harvest and husbandry to
manage: for I reaped my corn in its feafon, and carried it home as well as I could, and laid it up in the
ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to rub it out;
for I had no floor to threfh it on, or instrument to
threfh it with.
And now indeed my flock of corn increafing, I
really wanted to build my barns bigger: I wanted a
place to lay it up in; for the increafe of the corn now
yielded me fo much, that I had of the barley about
twenty bufhels, and of the rice as much, or more -
infomuch that I now refolved to begin to ufe it freely,
for my bread had been quite gone a great while;
alfo I refolved to fee what quantity would be fufficient
for me a whole year, and to fow but once a year.
Upon the whole, I found that the forty bufhels of
barley and rice were much more than I could con-
fume in a year; fo I refolved to fow just the fame
quantity every year that I fowed the laft, in hopes
that fuch a quantity would fully provide me with
bread, &c.
All the while these things were doing, you may be
furs my thoughts ran many times upon the prospect of land which I had feen from the other fide of -the
island ; and I was not without fecret wishes, that
I was on more there, fancying that feeing the mam land, and an inhabited country, I might find
fome way or other to convey myfelf farther, and
perhaps at laft find fome means of efcape,
But all this while I made no allowance for the
dangers of fuch a condition, and how I might fall
into the hands of favages, and perhaps fuch as I
might have reafon to think far worfe than the lions
and tygers of Africa: that if I once came into their
power, I would run an hazard more than a thoufand
to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;
for I had heard that the people of the Caribcan coafts
were canibals, or men-eaters; and I knew by the
latitude that I could not be far off from that more:
that, fuppofe they were not canibals, yet they might
kill me, as many Europeans who had fallen into their
hands had been ferved, even when they had been ten
or twenty together; much more I that was but one,
and could make little or no defence. All thefe things,
I fay, which I ought to have confidered well of, and
I did caft up in my thoughts afterwards, yet took
none of my apprehenfions at firft; and my head
ran mightily upon the thoughts of getting over to
that more.
Now I wifhedfor my boy Xury, and the long-boat,
with the moulder of mutton fail, with which I failed
above a thoufand miles on the coal of Africa; but
this was in vain. Then I thought I would go and
look on our map's boat, which, as I have faid, was
blown up upon the lore a great way in the ftorm,
when we were firft caft away. She lay almoft where
she did at first, but not quite; and was turned by the
force of the waves and the winds, almoft bottom
upwards, againft the high ridge of a beachy rough
fand, but no water about her as before.
If I had had hands to have refitted her, and have
launched her into the water, the boat would have
done
done well enough, and I might have gone back into*
the Brafils with her eafy enough; but I might have
eafily forefeen, that I could no more turn her, and
fet her upright upon her bottom, than I could remove
the ifland. However I went to the wood, and cut
leavers and rollers, and brought them to the boat,
refolving to try what I could do; fuggefting to my" felf, that if I could but turn her down, I might
eafily repair the damage fhe had received, and he would be a very good boat, and I might go to fea in
her very eafily.
I spared no pains indeed in this piece of fruitlefs toil,
and fpent, I think, three or four weeks about it; at
laft finding it impoffible to heave it up with my little
ftrength, I fell to digging away the fand to under-
mine it; and fo to make it fall down, fetting pieces
of wood to thrust and guide it right in the fall.
But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it
up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move it
forwards towards the water; fo I was forced to give
it over: and yet, though I gave over the hopes of
the boat, my defire to venture over for the main
increafed, rather than decreafed, as the means for it
seemed impossible. This at length fet me upon thinking whether it was
not possible to make myfelf a canoe or periagua, fuch
as the natives of thofe climates make, even without
tools, or, as I might fay, without hands, viz. of the
trunk of a great tree. This I not only thought
poffible, but eafy; and pleafed myfelf extremely with
my thoughts of making it, and with my having
much more convenience for it than any of the negroes
or Indians } but not at all confidering the particular
inconveniencies
rnconveniencies which I lay under more than the
Indians did, viz. want of hands to move it into the
water, when it was made; a difficulty much harder
for me to furmount than all the confequences of want
of tools could be to them: for what was it to me,
that when I had chofen a vast tree in the woods, I
might with great trouble cut it down, if after I might
be able with my tools to hew and dub the out-
fide into a proper fhape of a boat, and burn or cut
out the infide to make it hollow, fo to make a boat
of it, if, after all this, I muft leave it just there where
I found it, and was not able to launch it into the
water?
One would have thought, I could not have had
the leaft reflection upon my mind of my circumftancc^
while I was making this boat, but I would have
immediately thought how I would get it into the fea;
but my thoughts were fo intent upon my voyage
over the fea in it, that I never once confidered how
I fhould get it off the land; and it was really in its
own nature more eafy for me to guide it over forty-
five miles of fea, than about forty-five fathom of
land, where it lay, to fet it afloat in the water.
I went to work upon this boat the moft like a fool
that ever man did, who had any of his fenfes.awake.
I pleafed myfelf with the defign, without determining
whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but that
the difficulty of launching my boat came often into
my head; but I put a flop to my own inquiries into
it by this foolifh anfwer, which I gave myfelf; let me first make it, I'll warrant I'll find fome way or
other to get it along, when it is done.
This was a moft prepofterous method; but the
eagernefs of my fancy prevailed, and to work I went,
and felled a cedar-tree: I queftion much whether
Solomonever had fuch an one for the building the
t temple at Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches dia-
meter at the lower part next the ftump, and four feet
e leven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two feet,
after which it leflened for a while, and then parted
into branches: It was not without infinite labour
that I felled this tree: I was twenty days hacking
and hewing at it at the bottom ; I was fourteen more
getting the branches and limbs, and the vast fpread-
ing head of it cut off, which I hacked and hewed
through with my axe and hatchet, with inexpreffible
labour: after this it coft me a month to fhape it,
and dub it to a proportion, and to fomething like the
bottom of a boat, that it might fwim upright as it
ought to do. It coft me near three months more to
clear the infide, and work it out fo as to make'an
exacl: boat of it: this I did indeed without fire, by
mere mallet and chiffel, and by the dint of hard
labour; till I had brought it to be a very handfome
periagua, and big enough to have carried fix and
twenty men, and confequently big enough to have
carried me and all my cargo.
When I had gone through this work, I was
extremely delighted with it: the boat was really
much bigger than I ever faw a canoe or periagua,
that was made of one tree, in my life; many a weary
stroke it had colt, you may be fure, for there
remained nothing but to get it into the water; and
had I gotten it into the water, I make no question but I should have begun the madeft voyage, and the
moft.
Kioft unlikely to be performed, that ever was under taken.
But all my devices to get it into the water failed
me, though they col infinite labour too; it lay
about one hundred yards from the water, and not
more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up
hill towards the creek: Well, to take away this dif-
couragement, I refolved to dig into the furface of the
earth, and fo make a declivity; this I began, and it
coft me a prodigious deal of pains: but who grudge
pains, that have their deliverance in view? but
when this was worked through, and this difficulty
managed, it was still much at one; for I could no
more ftir the canoe, than I could the other boat.
Then I meafured the diftance of ground, and
refolved to cut a dock, or canal, to bring the water
up to the canoe, feeing I could not bring the canoe
down to the water: Well, I began this work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculated how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the fluff to
be thrown out, I found, that by the number of hands
I had, being none but my own, it muft have been
ten or twelve years before I would have gone through
with it; for the more lay high, fo that at the upper
end it muft have been at leaft twenty feet deep; fo
at length, though with great reluctancy, I gave this
attempt over alfo.
This grieved me heartily, and now I faw, though
too late, the folly of beginning a work before we
count the colt, and before we judge rightly of our
own ftrength to go through with it.
Jn the middle of this work I finifhed my fourth
year in this place, and kept my anniverfary with the
VOL. I, M fame
fame devotion, and with as much comfort, as ever
before; for by a conftant ftudy, and ferious applica-
tion of the word of GOD, and by the afliftance of his
grace, I gained a different knowledge from what I had
before; I entertained different notions of things; I
looked now upon the world as a thing remote; which
I had nothing to do with, no expedition from, and
indeed no defires about: in a word, I had nothing in-
deed to do with it,norv/aseverlike tohave; fo I thought
it looked as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter ;.
viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of
it; and well I might fay, as father Abraham to
Dives, Between me and thee there is a great gulph
fixed.
In the first place, I was removed from all the
wickednefs of the world here: I had neither the lust. of the flour, the luft of the eye, or the pride of life r
I had nothing to covet, for I had all I was now capa-
ble of enjoying: I was lord of the whole manor, or,
if I pleafed, I might call myfelf king or emperor over
the whole country which I had poiTeffion of: there
were no rivals: I had no competitor, none to difpute
fovereignty or command with me; I might have
raifed fhip-loadings of corn, but I had no ufe for it;
fo I let as little grow as I thought enough for my
occafion; I had tortoifes, or turtles enough; but now
and then one was as much as I could put to any ufe t
I had timber enough to have built a fleet of ships ; I
had grapes enough to have made wine, or to have
cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when
they had been built.
But all I could make use of, was all that was valu-
able: I had enough to eat, and to fupply my wants, and
and what was all the reft to me? If I killed more
flefh than I could eat, the dog muft eat it, or the
vermin; if I fowed more corn than I could eat, it
must be fpoiled: The trees that I cut down were
lying to rot on the ground, I could make no more
ufe of them than for fuel; and that I had no occasion for, but to drefs my food.
In a word, the nature and experience of things
dictated to me upon just reflection, that all the good
things of this world are no farther good to us, than as
they are for our ufe : and that whatever we may heap
up indeed to give to others, we enjoy as much as we
can ufe, and no more. The most covetous griping
mifer in the world would have been cured of the vice
of covetoufnefs, if he had been in my cafe; for I
poffeffed infinitely more than I knew what to do with.
I had no room for defire, except it was of things
which I had not, and they were but trifles, though
indeed of great ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before,
a parcel of money, as well gold as filver, about thirty-
fix pounds fterling; alas! there the nafty forry ufelefs
ftuff lay; I had no manner of bufinefs for it; and I
often thought with myfelf, that I would have given
an handful of it for a groce of tobacco-pipes, or for an
hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have given
it all for sixpenny -worth of turnip and carrot feed out
of England, or for an handful of peas and beans, and
a bottle of ink: as it was, I had not the leaft advan-
tage by it, or benefit from it; but there it lay in a
drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave,
in the wet feafon; and if I had had the drawer full of
diamonds, it had been the fame cafe; and they had
been of no manner of value to me, becaufe of no ufe.
M 2 I had
I had now brought my ftate of life to be much eafier
in itfelf than it was at firft, and much eafier to my
mind, as well as to my body. I frequently fat dotvn
to my meat with thankfulnefs, and admired the hand
of GOD'S providence, which had thus fpread my table
in the wildernefs: I learned to look more upon the
bright fide of my condition, and lefs upon the dark
fide; and to confider what I enjoyed, rather than
what I wanted; and this gave me fometimes fuch
fecret comforts, that I cannot exprefs them; and
which I take notice of here, to put thofe difcontented
people in mind of it,. who cannot enjoy comfortably
what GOD hath given them, becaufe they fee and
covet fomething that he has not given them: all our
difcontents about what we want, appeared to me to
fpring from the want of thankfulnefs for what we have.
Another reflection was of great ufe to me, and
doubtlefs would be fo to any one that fhould fall into
fuch diftrefs as mine was; and this was, to compare
my prefent condition with what I at first expected it
fhould be; nay, with what it would certainly have
been, if the good providence of GOD had not won-
derfully ordered the fhip to be caft up near to the
fhore, where I not only could come at her, but could
bring what I got o\it of her to the fhore for my relief
and comfort; without which I had wanted tools to
work, weapons for defence, or gunpowder and fhot
for getting my food.
I fpent .whole hours, I may fay whole days, in
reprefenting to myfelf in the moft lively colours, how
I muft have acted, if I had got nothing out of the
fhip ; how I could not have fo much as got any food,
except fish and turtles} and that, as it was long before
I found
I found any of them, I muft have perifhed firft: that
I should have lived, if I had not perifhed, like a mere
favage: that if I had killed a goat or a fowl by any
contrivance, I had no way to flay or open them, or
part the flefh from the fkin and the bowels, or to cut
it up; but muft gnaw it with my teeth, and pull it
with my claws, like a beaft.
Thefe reflexions made me very fenfible of the good-
nefs of Providence to me, and very thankful for my
prefent condition, with all its hardfhips and misfor-
tunes: and this part alfo I cannot but recommend to
the reflection of thofe who are apt in their mifery to
fay, Is any affliction like mine? let them confider,
how much worfe the cafes of fome people are, and
what their cafe might have been, if Providence had
thought fit.
I had another reflection which affifted me alfo to
comfort my mind with hopes; and this was, com-
paring my prefent condition with what I had
deserved, and had therefore reafon to expect from
the hand of Providence; I had lived a dreadful life,
perfectly deftitute of the knowledge and fear of GOD:
I had been well inftru&ed by father and mother;
neither had they been wanting to me in their early
endeavours, to infufe a religious awe of GOD into
my mind, a fenfe of my duty, and of what the nature
and end of my being required of me: But, alas!
falling early into the feafaring life, which of all the
lives is the moft deftitute of the fear of GOD, though
bis terrors are always before them; I fay, falling
early into the feafaring life, and into feafaring com-
pany, all that little fenfe of religion which I had
entertained, was laughed out of me by my messmates ;
M 3 by
by an hardened defpifing of dangers, and the views
of death, which grew habitual to me ; by my long
abfence from all manner of opportunities to converfe
with any thing but what was like myfelf, or to
hear any thing of what was good, or tended to-
wards it.
So void was I of every thing that was good, or of
the leaft fenfe of what I was, or was to be, that in
the greatest deliverance I enjoyed, fuch as my efcape
fromSallee, my being taken up by thePortuguefemzfter
of the fhip, my being planted fo well in BrafJ, my
receiving the cargo from England, and the like, I
never once had the words, thank GOD fo much as on
my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest dif-
trefs, had I fo much thought as to pray to him; nor
fo much as to fay, Lord, have mercy upon me! No,
not to mention the name of GOD, unlefs it was to
fwear by, and blafpheme it.
I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many
months, as I have already observed, on the account
of my wicked and hardened life paft; and when I
looked about me, and confidered what particular
providences had attended me, fince my coming into
this place, and how GOD had dealt bountifully with
me; had not only punifhed me lefs than my iniquity
deferved, but had fo plentifully provided for me;
this gave me great hopes that my repentance was
accepted, and that GOD had yet mercies in ftore
for me.
With thefe reflections I worked my mind up, not
only to refignation to the will of GOD in the prefent
difpofition of my circumftances, but even to a fincere
thankfulnefs of my condition; and that I, who was
yet a living man, ought not to complain, feeing I
had
had not the due punifhment of my (fins; that I
enjoyed fo many mercies, which I had no reafon to
have expected in that place, that I ought never more
to repine at my condition, but to rejoice, and to
give daily thanks, for that daily bread, which no-
thing butacloud of wonders could have brought: that
I ought to confider I had been fed even by a miracle,
even as great as that of feeding Elijah by ravens; nay,
by a long feries of miracles; and that I could hardly
have named a place in the uninhabited part of the
world, where I could have been cal more to my
advantage: a place, where, as I had no fociety, which
was my affliction on one hand, fo I found no ravenous
beafts, no furious wolves or tygers, to threaten my
life; no venomous creatures, or poifonous, which
I might have fed on to my hurt, no favages to murder
and devour me.
In a word, as my. life was a life of farrow one
way, fo it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted
nothing to make it a life of comfort, but to be able
to make my fenfe of GOD'S goodnefs to me, and care
over me in this condition, be my daily confolation;
and after I made a just improvement of these things,
I went away, and was no more fad.
I had now been here fo long, that many things
which I brought on more for my help, were either
quite gone, or.very much waited, and near fpent.
My ink, as I obferved, had been gone for fome
time, all but a very little, which I eked out with
water a little and a little, till it was fo pale it fcarce
left any appearance of black upon the paper: as long
as it lashed, I made ufe of it to minute down the days
of the month on which any remarkable thing hap-
M 4 pened
pened to me; and firft, by calling up rimes paft, I
remember that there was a strange concurrence of
days, in the various providences which befel me,
and which, if I had been fuperftitioufly inclined to
obferve days as fatal or fortunate. I might have had
reafon to have looked upon with a great deal of
curiofity.
Firft, I had obferved, that the fame day that I
broke away from my father and my friends, and ran
away to Hull in order to go to fea, the fame day
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man of war, and
made a flave.
The fame day of the year that I efcaped out of the
wreck of that fhip in Yarmouth Roads, that fame day
of the year afterwards I made my efcape from Salleein the boat.
The fame day of the year I was born on, viz. the
20th of September, the fame day I had my life fo mira-
culoufly faved 26 years after, when I was caft on more
in this island ; fo that my wicked life, and folitary
life, both began on a day.
The next thing to my ink's being waited, was that
of my bread, I mean the bifcuit which I brought out
of the fhip: This I had hufbanded to the laft degree,
allowing myfelf but one cake of bread a day, for
above a year: and yet I was quite without bread for
a year before I got any corn of my own; and great
reafon I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the
getting it being, as has been already obferved, next
to miraculous.
My clothes too began to decay mightily: as to
linen, I had none a good while, except fome che-
quered shirts which I found in the-chefts of the other
feameiv,
feamen, and which I carefully preferved, becaufe
many times I could bear no other clothes on but a
shirt ; and it was a very great help to me, that I
had among all the men's clothes of the fhip almost three dozen of fhirts. There were alfo feveral thick
watch-coats of the feamen, which were left behind,
but they were too hot to wear; and though it is
true, that the weather was fo violent hot, that there
was no need of clothes, yet I could not go quite
naked; no, though I had been inclined to it, which
I was not; nor could I abide the thoughts of it,
though I was all alone.
One reafon why I could not go quite naked, was,
I could not bear the heat of the fun fo well when
quite naked, as with fome clothes on; nay, the very
heat frequently bliftered my fkin; whereas, with a
fhirt on, the air itfelf made fome motion, and whift-
ling under the shirt, was twofold cooler than without
it: no more could I ever bring myfelf to go out in
the heat of the fun without a cap or an hat; the heat
of the fun beating with fuch violence as it does in that
place, would give me the head-ach prefently, by
darting fo directly on my head, without a cap or hat
on, fo that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put
on my hat, it would prefently go away.
Upon thefe views I began to confider about putting
the few rags I had, which I called clothes, into fome
order; I had worn out all the waiftcoats I had, and
my bufinefs was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch coats which I had by
me, and with fuch other materials as I had; fo I fet
to work a tailoring, or rather indeed a botching;
for I made most piteous work of it. However, I
made
made fhift to make two or three waiftcoats, which I
hoped would ferve me a great while; as for breeches
or drawers, I made but very sorry shift indeed, till
afterwards.
I have mentioned that I saved the ferns of all the
creatures that I killed, I mean four-footed ones; and
I had hung them up stretched out with sticks in the
fun; by which means ibme of them were fo dry and
hard, that they were fit for little; but others, it
feems, were very ufeful. The firft thing I made of
thefe was a great cap for my head, with the hair on
the outfideto moot off the rain; and this I performed
fo well, that after this I made afuit of clothes wholly
of thofe fkins; that is to fay, a waistcoat and breeches
open at the knees, and both loofe; for they were
rather wanted to keep me cool, than to keep me
warm. I muft not omit to acknowledge, that they
were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
I was a worfe taylor: however, they were fuch
as I made a very good shift with; and when I was
abroad, if it happened to rain, the hair of the waistcoat and cap being outmoft, I was kept very. dry.
After this I fpent a deal of time and pains to make
me an umbrella: I was indeed 'in great want of
one, and had a great mind to make one: I had feen
them made in the Drafils, where they are very ufeful
in the great heats which are there; and I felt the
heats every jot as great here, and greater too, being
nearer the.equinox; befides, as I was obliged to be
much abroad, it was a moft ufeful thing to me, as
well for the rains as the heats. I took a world of
pains at it, and was a great while before I could
make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought
I had
I had hit the way, I fpoiled two or three before I
made one to my mind; but at laft I made one that
anfwered indifferently well; the main difficulty I
found was to make it to let down. I could make it
to fpread; but if it did not let down too, and draw
in, it would not be portable for me any way, but just over my head, which would not do: However, at
last, as I faid, I made one to anfwer; I covered it
with fkins, the hair upwards, fo that it cafe off the
rain like a penthoufe, and kept off the fun fo effec-
tually, that I could walk out in the hottest of the
weather, with greater advantage than I could before
in the cooleft ; and when I had no need of it, I could
clofe it, and carry it under my arm.
Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being
entirely compofed by refigning to the will of GOD,
and throwing myfelf wholly upon the difpofal of his
providence: this made my life better than fociable;
for when I began to regret the want of converfation,
I would ah myfelf, whether thus converfing mutually
with my own thoughts, and, as I hope, I may fay,
with even my Maker, by ejaculations and petitions,
was not better than the utmoft enjoyment of human
fociety in the world?
I cannot fay, that after this, for five years, any
extrordinary thing happened to me; but I lived on
in the fame courfe, in the fame pofture and place,
just as before: the chief thing I was employed in,
befidcs my yearly labour of planting my barley and
rice, and curing my raisins, of both which I always
kept up just enough to have sufficient flock of the
year's provifions beforehand; I fay, besides this
yearly labour, and my daily labour of going out with
my
my gun, I had one labour to make me a canoe, which
at laft I finished : fo that by digging a canal to it, fix
feet wide, and four feet deep, I brought it into the
creek, almoft half a mile. As for the firft, that was
fo vaftly big, as I made it without considering before-
hand, as I ought to do, how I would be able to
launch it; fo never being able to bring it to the
water, or bring the water to it, I was obliged to let
it lie where it was, as a memorandum to teach me
to be wifer next time. Indeed the next time, though
I could not get a tree proper for it, and was in a
place where I could not get the water to it, at any
lefs diftance than, aslhavefaid, of near half a mile;
yet as I faw it was practicable at laft, I never gave it
over; and though I was near two years about it, yet
I never grudged my labour, in hopes of having a
boat to go off to fea at laft.
However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the fize of it was not at all anfwerable to the de-
fign which I had in view, when I made the firft; I
mean of venturing over to the Terra Firma, where
it was above forty miles broad; accordingly, the
fmallnefs of myboataffifted to put an end to that defign,
and now I thought no more of it: But as I had a
boat, my next defign was to make a tour round the
island ; for as I had been on the other fide, in one
place, croffing, as I have already defcribed it, over
the land, fo the discoveries I made in that journey
made me very eager to fee the other parts of the
coaft; and now I had a boat, I thought of nothing
but failing round the island. For this purpofe, and that I might do every thing
with difcretion and confideration, I fitted up a little
malt mast to my boat, and made a fail to it out of fome
of the pieces of the fhip's fails, which lay in store, and of which I had a great ftore by me.
Having fitted my maft and fail, and tried the
boat, I found me would fail very well: Then I
made little lockers and boxes at each end of my
boat, to put provifions, neceflaries, and ammunition,
&c. into, to be kept dry, either from rain, or the
fpray of the fea; and a little long hollow place
I cut in the infide of the boat, where I could lay
my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to keep
it dry.
I fixed my umbrella alfo in a ftep at the stern, like
a mast, to ftand over my head, and keep the heat
of the fun off me, like an awning; and thus I every
now and then took a little voyage upon the fea, but
never went far out, nor far from the little creek;
but at laft, being eager to view the circumference of
my little kingdom, I refolved upon my tour, and
accordingly I victualled my fhip for the voyage;
putting in two dozen of my loaves (cakes I would rather call them) of barley-bread; an earthen pot
full of parched rice, a food I eat a great deal of, a
little bottle of rum, half a goat, and powder with
fhot for killing more, and two large watch-coats, of
thofe which, as I mentioned before, I had faved out
of the feamen's chefts; thefe I took, one to lie upon,
and the other to cover me in the night.
It was the fixth of November, in the fixth year of
my reign, or my captivity, which you pleafe, that I
fet out on this voyage, and I found it much longer
than I expected; for though the ifland itfelf was not
very large, yet when I came to the eaft fide of it, I
found
found a great ledge of rocks lie out about two leagues
into the fea, fome above water, fome under it;
and beyond this a fhoal of fand, lying dry half a
league more; fo that I was obliged to go a great way
out to fea to double that point.
When I firft difcovered them, I was going to give
over my enterprize, and come back again, not
knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
fea, and above all, doubting how I would get back
again; fo I came to an anchor, for I had made me a
kind of an anchor with a piece of broken grappling
which I got out of the fhip.
Having fecured my boat, I took my gun, and
went on more, climbing up an hill, which feemed to
overlook that point, where I faw the full extent of
it, and refolved to venture.
In my viewing the fea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a ftrong, and indeed, a mof t furious
current, which ran to the eaft, even came clofe to
the point; and I took the more notice of it, becaufe
I faw there might be fome danger, that when I came
into it, I might be carried out to fea by the ftrength
of it, and not be able to make the ifland again: And
indeed, had I not gotten first upon this hill, I believe
it would have been fo ; for there was the fame current
on the other fide of the ifland, only that it fer. it off at a farther distance ; and I faw there was a ftrong
eddy under the shore ; fo I had nothing to do but to
get out of the firft current, and I would prefently be
in an eddy.
I lay here, however, two days; becaufe the wind
blowing pretty frefh (E. at S. E. and that being just contrary to the faid current) made a greatbreach of
the
the fea upon the point; fo that it was not fafe for
me to keep too clofe to the fhore for the breach, nor
to go too far off becaufe of the ftream.
The third day in the morning, the wind having
abated over night, the fea was calm, and I ventured;
but I am a warning-piece again to allrafh and ignorant
pilots; for ifo fooner was I come to the point, when
I was not my boat's length from the more, but
I found myfelf in a great depth of water, and a
current like a fluice of a mill: It carried my boat
along with it with fuch violence, that all I could do
could not keep her fo much as on the edge of it: but
I found it hurried me farther and farther out from the
eddy, which was on the left hand. There was no
wind ftirring to help me, and all that I could do with
my paddles signified nothing; and now I began to
give myfelf over for loft; for, as the current was on
both fides the ifland, I knew in a few leagues distance they muft join again, and then I was irrecoverably
gone; nor did I fee any possibility of avoiding it; fo
that I had no prospect before me but of perishing ;
not by the fea, for that was calm enough, but of
starving for hunger. I had indeed found a tortoife
on the more, as big almost as I could lift, and had
toned it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to fay, one of my earthen pots; but
what was all this to being driven into the vaft ocean,
where, to be fure, there was no more, no main land
or ifland, for a thoufand leagues at leaf t!
And now I faw how eafy is was for the providence
of GOD to make the mof t miferable condition that
mankind could be in, worfe. Now I looked back
upon my defolate folitary ifland, as the moft
- pleafant
plafant place in the world, and all the happinefs my
heart could wifh for, was to be there again : I flretched
out my hands to it with eager wifhes; O happy
del'art! faid I, I fhall never fee thee more; O
miferable creature! faid I, whither am I going!
then I reproached myfelf with my unthankful temper,
and how I had repined at my folitary condition; and
now what would I give to be on fhore there again?
Thus we never fee the true state of our condition,
till it is illuftrated to us by its contraries; nor know
how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it:
it is scarce possible to imagine the confternation I was
now in, being driven from my beloved ifland (for fo
it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean,
almost two leagues, and in the utmost defpair of ever
recovering it again: however, I worked hard, till
indeed my ftrength was almoft exhaufted; and kept
my boat as much to the northward, that is, towards
the fide of the current which the eddy lay on, as
poffibly I could; when about noon, as the fun patted
the meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind
in my face, fpringing up from the S. S. E. This
cheared my heart a little, and efpecially when in
about half an hour more it blew a pretty finall gentle
gale: by this time I was gotten at a frightful distance from the island ; and, had the lean cloud or hazy
weather intervened, I had been undone another way
too; for I had no compafs on board, and fhould
never have known how to have fleeced towards the
island, if I had but once loft fight of it; but the
weather continuing clear, I applied myfelf to get up
my malt again, and fpread my fail, ftanding away
to the north as much as poffible, to get out of the
current.
Juft
Just as I had fet my malt and fail, and the boat
began to ftretch away, I faw even by the clearnefs of
the water, fome alteration of the current was near;
for where the current was fo ftrong, the water was
foul; but perceiving the water clear, I found the
current abate, and prefently I found to the eaft, at
about half a mile, a breach of the fea upon fome
rocks; thefe rocks I found caufed the current to
part again; and as the main ftrefs of it ran away
more foutherly, leaving the rocks to the northeast, fo the other returned by the repulfe of the rock, and
made a ftrong eddy, which ran back again to the
northwest with a very fharp ftream.
They who know what it is to have a reprieve
brought to them upon the ladder, or to be refcued
from thieves just going to murder them, or who have
been. in such like extremities, may guefs what my
prefent furprize of joy was, and how gladly I put
my boat into the ftream of this eddy; and the wind
alfo frefhening, how gladly I fpread my fail to it,
running chearfully before the wind, and with a ftrong
tide or eddy under foot.
This eddy carried me about a league in my way
back again directly towards the ifland, but about
two leagues more towards the northward than the
current lay, which carried me away at first ; fo that
when I came near the ifland, I found myfelf open
to the northern more of it, that is tp fay, the other
end of the ifland, oppofite to that which I went out
from.
When I had made fomething more than a league of
way by the help of this current or eddy, I found it
was fpent, and faved me no farther. However I
VOL. I. N found,
found, that being between the two great currents,
viz. that on the fouth-fide which had hurried me
away, and that on the north, which lay about two
leagues on the other fide; I fay, between thefe two,
in the weft of the ifland, I found the water at leaft
flill, and running no way; and having still a breeze
of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly for
the ifland, though not making fuch frefh way as I
did before.
About four o'clock in the evening, being then
within about a league of the ifland, I found the point
of the rocks which occafioned this diftance ftretching
out as is defcribed before, to the fouthward, and
casting off the current more fouthwardly, had of
courfe made another eddy to the north, and this I
found very ftrong, but directly fetting the way my
. courfe lay, which was due weft, but almost full
north. However, having a fresh gale, I ftretched
acrofs this eddy, flaming north weft, and in
about an • hour came within about a mile of the
more, where, it being smooth water, I foon got
to land.
When I was on more, I fell on my knees, and
gave GOD thanks for my deliverance, refolving to
lay afide all thoughts of my deliverance by my boat;
and refrefhing myfelf with fuch things as I had, I
brought my boat clofe to the fhore, in a little cove
that I had efpied under fome trees, and laid me down
to fleep, being quite fpent with the labour and fatigue
of the voyage.
I was now at a great toys which way to get home
with my boat; I had ran fo much hazard, and knew
too much the cafe to think of attempting it by the
way
way I went out; and what might be at the other fide
(I mean the weft-fide) I knew not, nor had I any
mind to run any more ventures; fo I only refolved
in the morning to make my way weftward along the
more, and to fee if there was no creek where I might
lay up my frigate in fafety, fo as to have her again if I wanted her. In about three miles, or thereabouts,
coasting the more, I came to a very good inlet, or
bay, about a mile over, which narrowed till it came
to a very little rivulet, or brook, where I found a
convenient harbour for my boat, and where me lay
as if me had been in a little dock made on purpofe
for her; here I put in, and having flowed my boat
very fafe, I went on more to look about me, and fee
where I was.
I foon found I had but a little paiTed by the place
where I had been before when I travelled on foot to
that more; fo taking nothing out of my boat but my
gun and my umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I
began my march: the way was comfortable enough
after fuch a voyage as I had been upon, and I reached
my old bower in the evening, where I found every
thing ftanding as I left it; for I always kept it in
good order, being, as I faid before, my country-
houfe.
I got over the fence, and laid me down in the
fhade to reft my limbs, for I was very weary, and
fell afleep: but judge you, if you can, that read my
ftory, what a furprize I muft be in, when I was
awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my
name feveral times, Robin, Robin, Robin Crufoe,
poor Robin Crufoe! Where are you, Robin Crufoe?
Where are you? Where have you been?
N 2 I was
L.
I was fo dead afleep at first, being fatigued with
rowing, or paddling, as it is called, the firft part of
the day, and walking the latter part, that I did not
awake thoroughly; and dozing between fleeping and
waking, thought I dreamed that somebody fpoke to
me: but-as the voice continued to repeat Robin
Crufoe, Robin Crufoe; at laft I began to awake
more perfectly, and was at firft dreadfully frighted,
and ftarted up in the utmost confternation: but no
fooner were my eyes open, but I faw my pol fitting
on the top of the hedge, and immediately knew that
this was he that fpoke to me; for juft in fuch
bemoaning language I had used to talk to him, and
teach him; and he had learned it fo perfectly, that
he would fit upon my finger, and lay his bill clofe
to my; face, and cry, Poor Robin Crufoe, Where
are you ?. Where have you been? How came you
here? and fuch things as I had taught him.
However, even though I knew it was the parrot,
and that indeed it could be nobody. elfe, it was a good
while before I could compofe myfelf. Firft, I was
amazed how the creature got thither, and then how
he Ihould just keep about the place, and no where
elfe: but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody
but honest pol, I got it over; and holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name, pol, the fociable
creature came to me, and fat upon my thumb, as
he ufed to do, and continued talking to me, Poor
Robin Crufoe, and, how did I come here? and,
where had I been? juft as if he had been overjoyed
to fee me again; and fo I carried him home along
with me.
I had
I had now had enough of rambling to fea for fome
time, and had enough to do for many days to fit ftill,
and reflect upon the danger I had been in: I would
have been very glad to have had my boat again on
my fide of the ifland, but I knew not how it was
practicable to get it about: as to the eaft-fide of the
ifland, which I had gone round, I knew well enough
there was no venturing that way; my very heart
would fhrink, and my very blood run chill, but to
think of it: and to the other fide of the ifland, I did
not know how it might be there; but supposing the
current ran with the fame force againft the more at
the eaft, as it paired by it on the other, I might run
the fame rifque of being driven down the stream, and
carried by the ifland, as I had been before of being
carried away from it; fo with thefe thoughts I con-
tented myfelf to be without any boat, though it had
been the product of fo many months labour to make
it, and of fo many more to get into the fea.
In this government of my temper I remained near
a year, lived a very fedate retired life, as you may
well fuppofe; and my thoughts being very much
compofed, as to my condition, and fully comforted
in refigning myfelf to the difpofitions of Providence,
I thought I lived really very happily in all things,
except that of fociety.
I improved myfelf, in this time, in all the mechanic
exercifes which my neceffities put me upon applying
myfelf too; and I believe could, upon occafion, have
made a very good carpenter, efpecially. considering how few tools I had.
Befides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection
in my earthen ware, and contrived well enough to
N 3 make
make them with a wheel, which I found infinitely
eafier and better; becaufe I made things round and
fhapeable, which before were filthy things indeed to
look on. But I think I never was more vain of my
own performance, or more joyful for any thing I
found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-
pipe; and though it was a very ugly clumfy thing
when it was done, and only burnt red like other
earthen-ware, y\:t as it was hard and firm, and would
draw the fmoke, I was exceedingly comforted with
it; for I had been always ufed to smoke, and there
were pipes in the fhip, but I forgot them at firft, not
knowing there was tobacco in the ifland; and after-
wards, when I fearched the ship again, I could not
come at any pipes at all.
In my wicker-ware I alfo improved much, and
made abundance of necessary bafkets, as well as my
invention fhewed me, though not very handfome,
yet convenient for my laying things up in, or fetching
things home in. For example, if I killed a goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a tree, flay it, and
drefs it, and cut it in pieces, and bring it home in a
bafket; and the like by a turtle, I could cut it up,
take out the eggs, and a piece or two of the flefh,
which was enough for me, and bring them home in
a basket, and leave the raft behind me: alfo large
deep baskets were my receivers for my corn, which I always rubbed out as foon as it was dry, and cured;
and kept it in great baskets instead of a granary.
I began now to perceive my powder abated con fiderably; and this was a want which it was
impossible for me to fupply, and I began ferioufly to
confider what I muft do when I fhould have no more
powder;
powder; that is to fay, how I fhould do to kill any
goats. I had, as I obferved, in the third year of
my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her tame *
I was in hopes of getting an he kid, but I could not
by any means bring it to pafs, till my kid grew an
old goat; and I could never find in my heart to kill
her, till fhe died at laft of mere age.
But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have faid, my ammunition growing low, I
felt myfelf to study fome1 art to trap and fnare thego'ats,
to fee whether I could not catch fome of them alive;
and particularly Iwanted a me-goat great with young.
To this purpofe I made fnares to hamper them;
and believe they were more than once taken in them;
but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and
always found them broken, and my bait devoured.
At length I refolved to try a pit-fall; fo I dug
feveral large pits in the earth, in places where I had
obferved the goats ufed to feed, and over these pits
I placed hurdles of my own making too, with a great
weight upon them; and feveral times I put ears of
barley and dry rice, without fetting the trap; and
I could eafily perceive, that the goats had gone in,
and eaten up the corn, that I could fee the mark of
their feet: at length, I fet three traps in one night,
and going the next morning, I found them all
ftanding, and yet the bait eaten and gone: this was
very difcouraging; however, I altered my trap;
and, not to trouble you with particulars, going one
morning to fee my traps, I found in one of them a
large old he-goat; and, in one of the other, three
kids, a male and two females.
As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him; he was fo fierce I durst not go into the pit to
N 4 him
him; that is to fay, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted; I could have killed
him, but that was not my bufmefs, nor would it
anfwer my end; fo I e'en let him out, and he ran
away as if he had been frightened out of his wits;
but I did not then know what I afterwards learned,
that hunger would tame a lion: if I had let him ftay
there three or four days without food, and then have
carried him fome water to drink, and then a little
corn, he would have been as tame as one of the
kids; for they are mighty fagackms traceable crea-
tures, where they are well .ufed.
However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing
no better at that time; then I went to three kids;
and, taking them. one by one, I tied them with
firings together; and with fome difficulty brought
them all home.
It was a good while before they would feed, but
throwing them fome fweet corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame: and now I found,1 that
if I expected to fupply myfelf with goats-flefh, when
I had no powder or mot left, breeding fome up tame
was my only way, when perhaps I might have them
about my houfe like a flock of fheep.
But then it prefently occurred to me, that I muft
keep the tame from the wild, or elfe they would
always run wild when they grew up; and the only
way for this was to have fome inclofed piece of
ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to
keep them up fo effectually, that thofe within might
not break out, or thofe without break in.
This was a great undertaking for one pair.of hands;
yet as I faw there was an abfolute necessity of doing
it, my firfl piece of work was to find out a proper
piece
piece of ground; viz. where there was likely to be
herbage for them to eat, water for them to drink,
and cover to keep them from the fun.
Thole who underftand fuch inclofures, will think
I had very little contrivance, when I pitched upon a
place very proper for all these, being a plain open
piece of meadow-land or favanna (as our people call
it in the western colonies) which had two or three
little drills of fresh water in it, and at one end was
very woody; I fay they will smile at my forecast, when I mall tell them I began my inclofing of this
piece of ground in fuch a manner, that my hedge or
pale muft have been at leaft two miles about; nor
was the madnefs of it fo great as to the compafs; for
if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time
enough to do it in; but I did not consider, that my
goats would be as wild in fo much compafs, as if
they had had the whole ifland; and I fhould have fo
much room to chace them in, that I should never
catch them.
My hedge was began and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards, when this thought occurred to me;
fo I prefently ftopped fhort, and for the first begin-
ning I refolved to inclofe a piece of about 150 yards
in length, and 100 yards in breadth, which as it
would maintain as many as I would have in any rea-
fonable time, fo, as my flock increafed, I could add
more ground to my inclofure.
This was acting with fome prudence, and I went
to work with courage; I was about three months
hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done it, I
tethered the three kids in the bell part of it, and ufed
them to feed as near me as possible, to make them
familiar; and very often I would go and carry them
fome
fomc ears of barley, or an handful of rice, and feed
them out of my hand ; fo that after my inclofure was
finifhed, and I let them loose, they would follow me
up and down, bleating after me for an handful of corn.
This anfwered my end, and in about a year and a
half I had a flock of about twelve goats, kids and all;
and in two years more I had three and forty, besides feveral that I took and killed for my food; and after
that I inclofed five feveral pieces of ground to feed
them in, with little pens to drive them into, to take
them as I wanted them; and gates out of one piece
of ground into another.
But this was not all; for now I not only had goat's
flesh to feed on when I pleafed, but milk too, a thing
which indeed in my beginning I did not fo much as
think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts,
was really an agreeable furprize; for now I fet up
my dairy, and had fometimes a gallon or two of milk
in a day. And as nature, who gives fupplies of food
to every creature, dictates even naturally how to
make ufe of it; fo I, that never milked a cow, much
lefs a goat, or faw butter or cheefe made, very
readily and handily, though after a great many eflays
and mifcarriages, made me both butter and cheefe at
bit, and never wanted it afterwards.
How mercifully can out great Creator treat his
creatures, even in thofe conditions in. which they
feemed to be overwhelmed in destruction ! How can
he sweeten the bitterest providences, and give us
cause to praife him for dungeons and prifons! What
a table was here fpread from me in a wildernefs,
where I faw nothing at firft but to perish for hunger!
It would have made a ftoic finile, to have feen me
and my little family fit down to dinner: there was
my
my majesty, the prince and lord of the whole ifland;
I had the lives of all my subjects at abfolute com-
mand; I could hang, draw, give life and liberty, and
take it away, and no rebels among all my subjects. Then to fee how like a king I dined too, all alone,
attended by my fervants! Pol, as if he had been my
favourite, as the only pcrfon permitted to talk to me;
my dog, which was now grown very old and crazy,
and found no fpecies to multiply his kind upon, fat
always at my right-hand; and two cats, one on one
fide the table, and one on the other, expecting now
and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of fpecial
favour.
But these were not the two cats which I brought
on more at firft; for they were both of them dead,
and had been interred near my habitation by my own
hands ; but one of them having multipled by I know
not what kind of creature, thefe were two which I
preferved tame, whereas the reft ran wild into the
woods, and became indeed troublefome to me at
left ; for they would often come into my houfe, and
plunder me too, till at laft I was obliged to meet them, and did kill a great many; at length they left
me with this attendance, and in this plentiful man-
ner I lived; neither could I be faid to want any
thing but fociety, and of that, in fome time after
this, J was like to have too much.
I was fomething impatient, as I had obferved, to
have the ufe of my boat, though very loth to run
any more hazard; and therefore fometimes I fat
contriving ways to get her about the island, and at
other times I fat myfelf down contented enough
without her. But I had a ftrange uneafmefs in my
mind to go down to the point of the ifland, where,
as
as I have faid in my laft ramble, I went up the hill to fee how the more lay, and how the current fact, that I might fee what I had to do: this inclination
increafed upon me every day, and at length I refolved
to travel thither by land, and following the edge of
the more, I did fo: but had any one in England been
to meet fuch a man as I was, it muft either have
frighted them, or raifed a great deal of laughter;
and as I frequently stood Hill to look at myfelf, I
could not but fmile at the notion of my traveling through Yorkshirewith fuch an equipage, and in
fuch a drefs. Be pleafed to take a fketch of my
figure, as follows:
I had a great high fhapelefs cap, made of goat's
skin, with a flap hanging down behind, as well to
keep the fun from me, as to fhoot the rain off from
running into my neck; nothing being fo hurtful in
thefe climates, as the rain upon the flefh under the
clothes.
I had a mort jacket of goat's fkin, the fkirts coming
down to about the middle of my thighs ; and a pair of
open-kneed breeches of the fame: the breeches were
made of a fkin of an old he-goat, whofe hair hung
down fuch a length on either fide, that, like panta-
loons, it reached to the middle "of my legs. Stockings
and fhoes I had none; but I had made me a pair of
fomething, I foarce knew what to call them, like
buskins, to flap over my legs, and lace on either fide
like fpatterdafhes; but of a most barbarous shape, as
indeed were all the reft of my clothes.
I had'on a broad belt of goat's fkin dried, which I
drew together with two thongs of the fame, inftead
of buckles ; and in a kind of a frog on either fide ; of
this
this, instead of a fword and dagger, hung a little fa\v
and a hatchet; one on one fide, one on the other: I
had another belt not fo broad, and fastened in the
fame manner, which hung over my shoulder ; and
at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two
pouches, both made of goat's-fkin too; in one of
which hung my powder, in the other my mot: at
my back I carried my bafket, on my shoulder my
gun, and over my head a great clumfy ugly goat's.
skin umbrella, but which, after all, was the moft
necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun: as
for my face, the colour of it was really not fo Mulatto
We, as one might expect from a man not at all
careful of it, and living within nine or ten degrees of
the equinox. My beard I had once suffered to grow
till it was about a quarter of a yard long; but as I
had both fciffars and razors sufficient, I had cut it
pretty fhort, except what grew on my upper lip,
which I had trimed into a large pair of Mahometan
whifkers, fuch as I had feen worn by fome Turks,
whom I faw at Sallee: for the Moors did not wear
fuch, though the Turks did: of thefe muftachios, or
whifkers, I will not fay they were long enough to
hang my hat upon them; but they were of length
and mape monftrous enough, and fuch as in England
would have pafled for frightful.
But all this is by the bye ; for as to my figure, I had
fo few to obferve me, that it was of no manner of
confequence; fo I fay no more to that part: in this
kind of figure I went my new journey, and was out
five or fix days. I travelled firft along the lea.more,
directly to the place where I first brought my boat to
an anchor, to get up upon the rocks; and, having
no
no boat now to take care of, I went over the land
a nearer way, to the fame height that I was upon
before; when looking forward to the point of the
rock which lay out, and which I was to double with
my boat, as I faid above, I was furprized to fee the
fea all fmooth and quiet; no ripling, no motion,
no current, any more there than in other places.
I was at a strange lofs to underftand this, and re-
folved to fpend fome time in the observing of it, to
fee if nothing from the fets of the tide had occafioned
it: but I was prefently convinced how it was ; viz.
that the tide of ebb fetting from the weft, and join-
ing with the current of waters from fome great river
on the Ihore, must be the occafion of this current,
and that according as the wind blew more forcible
from the weft, or from the north, this current came
near, or went farther from the more; for, waiting
thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again,
and then the tide of ebb being made, I plainly faw
the current again as before, only that it ran farther
off, being near half a league from the more; whereas,
in my cafe, it fet clofe upon the more, and hurried
me in my canoe along with it, which at another time
it would not have done.
This obfervation convinced me, that I had nothing
to do but to obferve the ebbing and the flowing of the
tide, and I might very easily bring my boat about
the ifland again: but when I began to think of put-
ting it in practice, I had fuch a terror upon my fpirits
at the remembrance of the danger I had been in,
that I could not think of it again with any patience;
but on the contrary, I took up another refolution,
which
was more fafe, though more laborious; and
this was, that I would build, or rather make me
another periagua, or canoe; and fo have one for one
fide of the ifland, and one for the other.
You are to underftand, that now I had, as I may
call it, two plantations in the ifland; one my little
fortification or tent, with the wall about it under the
rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time
I had inlarged into feveral apartments or caves, one
within another. One of these, which was the driest and largeft, and had a door out beyond my wall or
fortification, that is to fay, beyond where my wall
joined to the rock, was all filled up with large ear-
then pots, of which I have given an account, and
with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would
hold five or fix bufhels each, where I laid up my
stores of provifion, efpecially my corn, fome in the
ear cut off fhort from the draw, and the other rubbed
out with my hands.
As for my wall, made as before, with long flakes
or piles, thofe piles grew all like trees, and were by
this time grown fo big, and fpread fo very much,
that there was not the least appearance, to any one's
view, of any habitation behind them.
Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the land, and upon lower ground, lay my
two pieces of corn ground; which I kept duly cul-
tivated and fowed, and which duly yielded me their
harvest in its feafon: and whenever I had occafionfor
more corn, I had more land adjoining as fit as
that.
Befides this, I had my country-feat, and I had now
3 tolerable plantation there alfo 5 for firft, I had my
little
little bower, as I called it, which I kept in repair 5
that is to fay, I kept the hedge which circled it in
conflantly fitted up to its ufual height, the ladder
flanding always in the infide; I kept the trees, which
at first were no more than my stakes, but were now-
grown. very firm .and tall; I kept them always fa
cut, that they might fpread and grow thick and wild,
and make the more agreeable made, which they did
effectually to my mind. In the middle of this I had
my tent always flanding, being a piece of a fail
fpread over poles fet up for that purpofe, and which
never wanted any repair or renewing; and under
this I had made me a fquab or couch, with the
fkins of the creatures I had killed, and with other
foirt things, and a blanket laid on them, fuch as
belonged to our fea-bedding, which I had faved, and
a great watch-coat to cover me; and here, whenever
I had occafion to be absent from my chief feat, I took
up my country habitation.
Adjoining to this I had my inclofures for my
cattle, that is to fay, my goats: And as I had taken
an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and inclofe
this ground, I was fo uneafy to fee it kept entire, left
the goats would break through, that I never left off,
till with infinite labour I had stuck the outfide of the
hedge fo full, of finall Makes, and fo near to one
another, that it was rather a pale than an hedge, and
there was fcarce room to put an hand through
between them, which afterwards, when thofe flakes
grew, as they all did in the next rainy feafon, made
the inclofure strong, like a wall, indeed ftronger than any wall.
This
This will teftify for me that I was not idle, and that
I fpared no pains to bring to pafs whatever appeared
necessary for my comfortable fupport; for I con-
fidered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus
at my hand, would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter and cheese, for me, as long as I lived
in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that
keeping them in my reach, depended entirely upon
my perfecting my inclofures to fuch a degree, that I
might be fure of keeping them together; which by
this method indeed I fo effectually fecured, that when
thefe little flakes began to grow, I had planted them
fo very thick, I was forced to pull fome of them up
again. In this place alfo I had my grapes growing, which
I principally depended on for my winter flore of
raifins, and which I never failed to preferve very
carefully, as the beft and moft agreeable dainty of my
whole diet; and indeed they were not agreeable only,
but phyfical, wholfome, nourishing and refreshing to the laft degree.
As this was alfo about half way between my other
habitation and the place where I had laid up my boat,
I generally ftaid and lay here in my way thither; for
I ufed frequently to vifit my boat, and I kept all
things about or belonging to her in very good order;
fometimes I went out in her to divert myfelf, but
no more hazardous voyages would I go, nor fcarce
ever above a ftone's caft or two from the more,
I was fo apprehenfive of being hurried out of my
knowledge again by the currents, or winds, or any
other accident: But now I come to a new fcene of
my life.
VOL. I. Q It
It happened one day about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly furprized with the print
of a man's naked foot on the more, which was very plain to be feen in the fand: I stood like one thun-
der-flr uck, or as if I had ken an apparition; I
listened, I looked round me, I could hear nothing,
nor fee any thing; I went up to a rifing ground to
look farther: I went up the more, and down the
fhore, but it was all one, I could fee no other
impression but that one: I went to it again to fee if
there were any more, and to obferve if it might not
be my fancy; but there was no room for that, for
there was exactly the very print of a foot, toes, heel,
and every part of a foot; how it came thither I knew
not, nor could in the leaft imagine. But after
innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man per-
fectly confufed, and out of myfelf, I came home to
my fortification, not feeling, as we fay, the ground I went on, but terrified to the left degree, looking
behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking; every bush and tree, and fancying every ftump at a-
distance to be a man; nor is it poflible to defcribe
how many various shapes an affrighted imagination
reprefented things to me in; how many wild ideas
were formed every moment in my fancy, and what
flrange unaccountable whimfies came into.my thoughts
by the way.
"When I came to my castle, for fo I think I called it
ever after this, I fled into it like one purfued;.
whether I went over by the ladder, as fir ft contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I called a
door, I cannot remember ; for never frighted hare fled

f T"V rrv YORK
fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of
mind than I to this retreat.
I had no sleep that night; the farther I was from
the occasion of my fright, the greater my appre-
henfions were; which is fomething contrary to the
nature of fuch things, and especially to the ufual
practice of all creatures in fear: But I was fo em barrafled with my own frightful ideas of the thing,
that I formed nothing but difinal imaginations to
myfelf, even though I was now a great way off it.
Sometimes I fancied it muft be the devil; and reafon
joined in with me upon this fuppofition: For how
fhould any other thing in human fhape come into the
place? Where was the veflel that brought them?
What marks were there of any other footfteps? And
how was it poffible a man fhould come there? But
then to think that Satan fhould take human fhape
upon him in fuch a place where there could be no
manner of occafion for it, but to leave the print of
his foot behind him, and that even for no purpofe
too (for he could not be fure I fhould fee it,) this was
an amazement the other way: I confidered that the
devil might have found out abundance of other ways
to have terrified me, than this of the fingle print of
a foot: That as I lived quite on the other fide of the
island, he would never have been fo fimple to leave a
mark in a place where it was ten thoufand to one
whether I would ever fee it or not, and in the fand
too, which the firft furge of the fea upon an high
wind would have defaced entirely: All this feemed
inconfiftent with the thing itfelf, and with all
notions we ufually entertain of the fubtlety of the
devil.
O 2 Abundance
Abundance of fuch things as thefe affifted to
argue me out of all apprehenfions of its being the
devil: And I prefently concluded that it must be
fome more dangerous creature; viz. That it muft
be fome of the ravages of the main land over-againft
me, who had wandered out to fea in their canoes,
and, either driven by the currents, or by contrary
winds, had made the ifland; and had been on more,
but were gone away again to fea, being as loth,
perhaps, to have laid in this defolate island, as I
would have been to have had them.
While thefe reflections were rolling upon my mind,
I was very thankful in my thought, that I was fo
happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or that
they did not fee my boat, by which they would have
concluded, that fome inhabitants had been in the
place, and perhaps have fearched farther for me:
Then terrible thoughts racked my imaginations
about their having found my boat, and that there
were people here; and that if fo, I would certainly
have them come again in greater numbers, and
devour me; that if it would happen fq that they
would not find me, yet they would find my inclo-
fure, deitroy all my corn, carry away all my flock
of tame goats, and I would perifh at laft for mere
want.
Thus my fear banifhed all my religious hope; all
that former confidence in GOD, which was founded
upon fuch wonderful experience as I had had of his
goodnefs, now vanifhed; as if he that had fed me by
miracle hitherto, could not preferve by his power
the provision which he had made for me by his
goodnefs, I reproached myself with my uneafinefs,
'that
that I would not fow any more corn one year, than
would just ferve me till the next feafon, as if no
accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the
crop that was upon the ground: And this I thought
fo just a reproof, that I re'blved for the future to
have two or three years corn before-hand, fo that
whatever might come, I might not perifh for want
of bread.
How flrange a chequer-work of Providence is the
life of man! And by what fecret differing fprings are
the affections hurried about, as differing circumflances
prefent! To day we love what to-morrow we hate;
to day we feek what to-morrow we shun ; to day we
defire what to-morrow we fear; nay, even tremble
at the apprehenfions of. This was exemplified in me
at this time in the mof t lively manner imaginable;
for I, whofe only affliction was, that I feemed
banifhed from human fociety, that I was alone, cir cumfcribed by the boundlefs ocean, cut off from
mankind, and condemned to what I call a filent life;
that I was as one whom heaven thought not worthy
to be numbered among the living, or to appear among
the reft of his creatures; that to have feen one of my
own fpecies, would have feemed to me a raifmg
me from death to life, and the greateft bleffing that
heaven itfelf, next to the fuprerne bleffing of falvation,
could bellow; I fay, that I fhould now tremble at
the very apprehenfions of feeing a man, and was
ready to fink into the ground, at but the shadow, or
silent appearance of a man's having fet his foot on the
island. Such is the uneven state of human life; and it
afforded me a great many curious fpeculations after-
O 3 wards,
wards, when I had a little recovered my firft furprlze}
I considered that this was the station of life the
infinitely wife and good providence of GOD had de-
termined for me; that as I could not forefee what
the ends of divine wifdom might be in all this, fo I
was not to difpute his sovereignty, who, as I was his
creature, had an undoubted right by creation to
govern and difpofe of me abfolutely as he thought
fit; and who, as I was a creature who had offended
him, had likewife a judicial right to condemn me to
what punifhment he thought fit; and that it was my
part to submit to bear his indignation, becaufe I had
finned againft him.
I then reflected, that GOD, who was not only
righteous, but omnipotent, as he had thought fit thus
to punifh and afflict me, fo he was able to deliver me j
that if he did not think fit to do it, it was my un-
questioned duty to resign myfelf abfolutely and en-
tirely to his will: And, on the other hand, it was
my duty alfo to hope in him, pray to him, and
quietly to attend the dictates and directions of his
daily providence.
Thefe thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay,
I may fay, weeks and months; and one particular
effect of my cogitations on this occafion I cannot
omit; viz. one morning early, lying in my bed, and
filled with thoughts about my danger from the ap-
pearance of favages, I found it difcompofed me very
much; upon which thofe words of the fcripture came
into my thoughts, Call upon me in the day of trouble,
and I will deliver thee, and thoujhalt glorify me.
Upon this, riling chearfully out of my bed, my
heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and
encouraged
encouraged to pray earneftly to GOD for deliverance:
"When I had done praying, I took up my bible, and
opening it to read, the firft words that presented to
me, were, Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and
ke JhatlJlrengtben thy heart: Wait, I fay, on the Lord.
It is impoffible to exprefs the comfort this gave me;
and in return, I thankfully laid down the book, and
was no more fad, at leaft, not on that occafion.
In the middle of thefe cogitations, apprehenficns,
and reflections, it came into my thoughts one day,
that all this might be a mere chimera of my own, and
that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when
I came on more from my boat: This cheared me up
a little too, and I began to perfuade myfelf it was all
a delufion; that it was nothing elfe but my own
foot; and why might not I come that way from the
boat, as well as I was going that way to the boat?
Again, I confidered alfo, that I could by no means
tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had
not; and that if at laft this was only the print of my
own foot, I had played the part of thofe fools, who
ftrive to make ftories of fpectres and apparitions, and
then are themfelves frighted at them more than any
body elfe.
Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad
again; for I had not ftirred out of my caftle for three
days and nights, fo that I began to starve for pro-
vifion 5 for I had little or nothing within doors, but
fome barley-cakes and water. Then I knew that my
goats wanted to be milked too, which ufually was my
evening diverfion; and the poor creatures were in
great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and
O 4 indeed
indeed it almost fpoiled fome of them, and almost dried up their milk.
Heartening myfelf therefore with the belief, that
this was nothing but the print of one of my own feet
(and fo I might be truly faid to flart at my own
fhadow,) I began to go abroad again, and went to
my country-houfe to milk my flock; but to fee with
what fear I went forward, how often I looked behind
me, how I was ready, every now-and-then, to lay
down my basket, and run for my life; it would have
made any one have thought I was haunted with an
evil confcience, or that I had been lately moit terri.'
bly frighted; and fo indeed I had.
However, as I went down thus two or three days,
and having feen nothing, I began to be a little bolder,
and to think there was really nothing in it but my
own imagination; but I could not perfuade myfelf
fully of this, till I would go down to the more again,
and fee this print of a foot, and meafure it by my
, own, and fee if there was any similitude or fitnefs,
that I might be assured it was my own foot: But
when I came to the place first, it appeared evidently
"to me, that when I laid up my boat, I could not
possibly be on more anywhere thereabouts: Secondly,
when I came to meafure the mark with my own foot,
I found my foot not fo large by a great deal: Both
thefe things filled my head with new imaginations,
and gave me the,vapours again to the higheft degree;
fo that 1 fhook with cold, like one in an ague, and I
went home again, filled with the belief, that fome
man or men had been on lore there; or, in short, that the ifland was inhabited, and I might be fur, prized
prized before I was aware; and what courfe to take
for my fecurity, I knew not.
O what ridiculous resolution men take, when
poffeffed with fear! It deprives them of the ufe of thofe
means which reafon offers for their relief. The
firft thing I propofed to myfelf was, to throw down
my inclofures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into
the woods, that the enemy might not find them, and
then frequent the ifland in profpect: of the fame, or
the like booty; then to the fimple thing of digging
up my two corn-fields, that they might not find fuch
a grain there, and frill to be prompted to^ frequent
the ifland; then to demolifh my bower and tent, that
they might not fee any vestiges of my habitation,
and be prompted to look farther, in order to find
out the perfons inhabiting.
Thefe were the subjects of the first night's cogita-
tion, after I was come home again, while the appre-
henfions which had fo over-run my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above.
Thus fear of danger is ten thoufand times more terri-
fying than danger itfelf, when apparent to the
eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety, greater by
much than the evil which we are anxious about;
but, which was worfe than all this, I had not that ~
relief in this trouble from the refighation I ufed to
practice, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought,
like Saul, who complained not only that the Philif-
tines were upon him, but that GOD had forfaken
him; for I did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to GOD in my diftrefs, and rest- ing upon his providence, as I had done before, for
my defence and deliverance; which if I had done, I
had,
had, at leaft, been more chearfully supported under
this new furprize, and perhaps carried through it
with more refolution.
This confufion of my thoughts kept me waking all
night; but in the morning I fell asleep, and having
by the amufement of my mind been, as it were, tried,
and my fpirits exhausted, I flept very foundly, and
awaked much better compofed than I had ever been
before: And now I began to think fedately; and,
upon the utmost debate with myfelf, I concluded,
that this ifland, which was fo exceeding pleafant,
fruitful, and no farther from the main land than as I
had feen, w as not fo entirely abandoned as I might
imagine: That although there were no stated in-
habitants who lived on the fpot; yet that there might
fometimes come boats off from the more, who either
with defign, or perhaps never but when they were
driven by crofs winds, might come to this place.
That I had lived here 15 years now, and had not
met with the leaft fhadow or figure of any people be-
fore; and that if at any time they would be driven
here, it was probable they went away again as foon
as ever they could, feeing they had never thought fit
to fix there upon any occafion, to this time.
That the mods I could fuggeft any danger from,
was, from any fuch cafual accidental landing of
straggling people from the main, who, as it was
likely, if they were driven hither, were here against their wills; fo they made no fray here, but went off
again with all poffible fpeed, feldom flaying one night
on more, left they would not have the help of the
tides and day-light back again; and that therefore I
had
had nothing to do but to confider of fome fafe retreat,
in cafe I fhould fee any favages land upon the fpot.
Now I began forely to repent that I had dug
my cave fo large, as to bring a door through again,
which door, as I faid, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock. Upon maturely
confidering this, therefore, I refolved to draw me
a second fortification, in the manner of a semi- circle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had
planted a double row of trees about twelve years be-
fore, of which I made mention: thefe trees having
been planted fo thick before, there wanted but a
few piles to be driven between them, that they
should be thicker and flronger, and my wall would
be foon finished. So that I had now a double wall, and my outer
wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables,
and every thing I could think of to make it ftrong;
having in it feven little holes, about as big as I might
put my arm out at. In the infide of this I thickened
my wall to about ten feet thick, continually bring-
ing earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of
the wall, and walking upon it; and through the
feven holes I contrived to plant the mufquets, of
which I took notice that I got feven on more out of
the ship ; thefe, I fay, I planted like my cannon,
and fitted them into frames that held them like a car-
riage, that fo I could fire all the feven guns in two
minutes time: this wall I was many a weary month
in finifhing, and yet never thought myfelf fafe till it
was done.
When this was done, I ftuck all the ground with-
out my wall, for a great way every way, as full with
ftakes
flakes or flicks of the ofier like wood, which I found
fo apt to grow, as they could well ft and; insomuch that I believe I might fet in near twenty thousand of
them, leaving a pretty large fpace between them
and my wall, that I might have room to fee an
enemy, and they might have no fhelter from the
young trees, if they attempted to approach my
outer wall.
Thus in two years time I had a thick grove; and
in five or fix years time I had a wood before my
dwelling, grown fo monftrous thick and strong, that it was indeed perfectly impassable ; and no man of what kind foever would ever imagine that there
was any thing beyond it, much lefs an habitation:
as for the way I propofed myfelf to go in and out (for
I left no avenue) it was by fetting two ladders; one
to a part of the rock which was low, and then broke
in, and left room to place another ladder upon that;
fo when the two ladders were taken down, no man •
living could come down to me without mifchiefing
himfelf; and if they had come down, they were still on the outfide of my outer wall.
Thus I took all the meafures human prudence
could suggest for my own prefervation ;. and it will
befeen at length, that they were not altogether with-
out just reafon; though I forefaw nothing at that
time more than my mere fear'fuggefted.
While this was doing, I was not altogether care-
lefs of my other affairs; for I had a great concern
upon me for my little herd of goats; they were hot
only a prefent fupply to me upon every occasion, and
began to be fufficient for me, without the expence of
powder and mot, but alfo abated the fatigue of my
hunting
hunting after the wild ones; and I was loth to lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurfe
up over again.
To this purpofe, after long confideration, I could
think but of two ways to preserve them; one was
to find another convenient place to dig a cave under
ground, and to drive them into it every night; and
the other was to inclofe two or three little bits of
land, remote from one another, and as much con-
cealed as I could, where I might keep about half
a dozen young goats in each place; fo that if any
difafter happened to the flock in general, I might be
able to raife them again with little trouble and time:
and this, though it would require a great deal of
time and labour, I thought was the moit rational
defign.
Accordingly I fpent fome time, to find out the
mof t retired parts of the ifland; and I pitched upon
one, which was as private indeed as my heart could
wish ; for it was a little damp piece of ground in the
middle of the hollow and thick woods, where, as is
obferved, I almoft loft myfelf once before, endea-
vouring to come back that way from the eastern part
of the ifland: here I found a clear piece of land
near three acres, fo furrounded with woods, that it
was almost an inclofure by.nature; at leaft it did not
. want near fo much labour to make it fo, as the other
pieces of ground I had worked fo hard at.
I immediately went to work with this piece of
ground, and in lefs than a month's time I had fo
fenced it round, that my flock or herd, call it which
you pleafe, which were not fo wild now'as at firit
they might be fuppofed to be, were well enough
fecured
LIFE AND ADVENTURE' fecured in it. So without any farther delay, I re-
moved ten five goats and two he goats to this piece ;.
and when there, I continued to perfec t the fence,
till I had made it as secure as the other, which, how-
ever, I did at more leifure, and it took me up more
time by a great deal.
All this labour I was at the expence of, purely
from my apprehenfions on the account of the print
of a man's foot which I had feen; for as yet, I never
faw any human creature come near the ifland, and I
had now lived two years under thefe uneafinefles,
which indeed made my life much lefs comfortable
than it was before; as may well be imagined, by any
who know what it is to live in the conftant fnare of
the fear of man; and this I muft obferve with grief
too, that the difcompofure of my mind had too great
impreflions alfo upon the religious part of my
thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into
the hands of favages and cannibals lay fo upon my
fpirits, that I feldom found myfelf in a due temper
for application to my Maker; at leaft, not with the
fedate calmnefs and refignation of foul which I was
wont to do. I rather prayed to GOD as under great
affliction and preflure of mind, furrounded with
danger, and in expectation every night of being
murdered and devoured before the morning; and I
muft teflify from my experience, that a temper of
peace, thankfulnefs, love and affection, is much
more the proper frame for prayer than that of terror
and difcompofure; and that under the dread of mif-
chief impending, a man is no more fit for a comfort-
ing performance of the duty of praying to GOD, than
he is for repentance on a fick bed j for thefe dif-
compofures
compofures affect the mind as the others do the body;
and the difcompofure of the mind mufl neceflarily
be as great a difability as that of the body, and much
greater; praying to GOD being properly an act of
the mind, not of the body.
But to go on; after I had thus fecured one part
of my little living flock, I went about the whole
island, fearching for another private place, to make
fuch another depofit; when wandering more to the
weft point of the ifland than I had ever done yet, and
looking out to fea, I thought I faw a boat upon
the fea at a great diftance; I had found a
perspective glafs or two in one of the feamen's
chefts, which I faved out of our fhip; but I had it
not about me, and this was fo remote, that I could
not tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till
my eyes were not able to look any longer; whether
it was a boat, or not, I do not know; but as I de-
fcended from the hill, I could fee no more of it, fo
I gave it over; only I refolved to go no more with-
out a perspective glafs in my pocket.
When I was come down the hill, to the end of
the island, where indeed I had never been before, I
was prefently convinced, that the feeing the print of
a man's foot, was not such a ftrange thing in the
ifland as I imagined; and, but that it was a fpecial
Providence that I was cal upon the fide of the ifland
where the favages never came, I should eafily have
known, that nothing was more frequent than for
the canoes from the main, when they happened to
be a little too far out at fea, to fhoot over to that fide
of the island for harbour; likewife, as they often met,
and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken
any prifoners, would bring them over to this more,
where,
where, according to their dreadful customs,beingall
cannibals, theywould kill and eat them: of which
hereafter.
When I was come down the hill to the fhore, as I
faid above, being the S. W. point of the ifland, I
was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
poffible for me to exprefs the horror of my mind, at
feeing the fhore fpread with fkulls, hands, feet, and
other bones of human bodies; and particularly I ob-
ferved a place where there had been a fire made, and
a circle dug in the earth, like a cock-pit, where it is
fuppofed the favage wretches had fat down to their
inhuman feaflings upon the bodies of their fellow-
creatures.
I was fo aftonifued with the fight of thefe things,
that I entertained no notions of any danger to myfelf
from it, for a long while; all my apprehenfions
were buried in the thoughts of fuch a pitch of inhu-
man, hellish brutality, and the horror of the degene-
racy of human nature; which, though I had heard
of often, yet I never had fo near a view of before;
in fhort, I turned away my face from the horrid fpec-
tacle; my stomach grew fick, and I was juft at the
point of fainting, when nature difcharged thediforder
from my ftomach, and, having vomited with an un-
common violence, I was a little relieved, but could
not bear to .ftay in the place a moment; fo I got me
up the hill again with all the fpeed I could, and
walked on towards my own habitation.
When I came a little out of that part of the island, I floodftill awhile as amazed; and then recovering
myfelf, I looked up with the utmoft affection of my
foul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave
Goo GOD thanks, that had caft my first lot in a part of the
world where I was diflinguifhed'from fuch dreadful
creatures as thefe; and that though I had esteemed my prefent condition very miferable, had yet given
me fo many comforts in it, that I had flill more to
give thanks for than to complain of; and this above
all, that I had, even in this miferable condition,
been comforted with the knowledge of himfelf, and
the hope of his blessing, which was a felicity more
than fufficiently equivalent to all the mifery which I
had fuffered, or could fuffer.
In this frame of thankful nefs I went home to my
castle; andbegan tobemuch eafier now, as to the fafety
of my circumflances, than ever I was before; for I
obferved, that thefe wretches never came to this
ifland in fearch of what they could get; perhaps not
feeking, not wanting, or not expecting, any thing
here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the
covered woody part of it, without finding any thing
to their purpose : I knew I had been here now almost eighteen years, andiiever faw the leaft footfteps of a
human creature there before; and might be here
eighteen more as entirely concealed as I was now, if
I did not difcover myfelf to them, which I had no
manner of occasion to do, it being my only bufinefs
to keep myfelf entirely concealed where I was, unlefs
I found a better fort of creatures than canibals to
make myfelf known to.
Yet I entertained fuch an abhorrence of the favage
\vretchcs that I have been fpeaking of, and of the
wretched inhuman cuftom of their devouring and
eating one another up, that I continued penfive and
fad, and kept clofe within my own circle for almost VOL. I. P two
two years after this: when I fay my own circle, f
mean by it my three plantations, viz. my caftle, my
country-feat, which I called my bower, and my in- clofure in the woods; nor did I look after this for
any other ufe than as an inclofure for my goats; for
the averfion which nature gave me to thefe hellish wretches was fuch, that I was as fearful of feeing
them as of feeing the devil himfelf; nor did I fo
much as go to look after my boat in all this time, but
began rather to think of making me another; for I
could not think of ever making any more attempts
to bring the other boat round the ifland to me, left I
fhould meet with fome of t.hofe creatures at fea, in
which, if I had happened to have fallen into their
hands, I knew what would have been my lot.
Time, however, and the fatisfaction I had, that I
was in no danger of being difcovered by thefe people,
began to wear off my uneasiness about them; and I
began to live just in the fame compofed manner as
before; only with this difference, that I ufed more
caution, and kept my eyes more about me than I
did before, left I would happen to be feen by any of
them; and particularly, I was more cautious of fir-
ing my'gun, left any of them on the ifland should happen to hear it; and it was therefore a very good
providence to me, that I had furnifhed myfelf with a
tame breed of goats, that I had no need to hunt any
more about the woods, or moot at them; and if I
did catch any more of them after this, it was by traps
and fnares, as I had done before; fo that for two
years after this, I believe I never fired my gun once off,
though I never went out without it; and, which was
more,as I hadfaved threepiftols out of the fhip, I always
carried
carried them out with me, or at leaft two of them,
flicking them in my goat-lkin belt: I likewife fur-
based up one of the great cutlasses that I had out of
the fhip, and made me a belt to put it in alfo; fo that
I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when
I went abroad, if you add to the former defcription
of myself, the particular of two pistols, and a great
broad-fword, hanging at my fide in a belt, but with-
out a fcabbard.
Things going on thus, as I have faid, for fome
time, I feemed, excepting thefe cautions, to be re-
duced to my former calm fedate way of living; all
thefe things tended to mew me more and more how
far my condition was from being miferable, com-
pared to fome others; nay, to many other particu-
lars of life, which it might have pleafed GOD to have
made my lot. It put me upon renewing, how little
repining there would be among mankind, at any
condition of life, if people would rather compare
their condition with thofe that are worfe, in order to
be thankful, than be always comparing them with
thofe which are better, to affift their murmurings
and complainings.
As in my prefer t condition there were not really
many things which I wanted, fo indeed I thought
that the frights I had been in about thefe favage
wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own
prefervation, had taken off the edge of my invention
for my own conveniencies, and I had dropt a good
defign, which I had once bent my thoughts upon;
and that was, to try if I could not make fome
of my barley into malt, and then try to brew myself fome beer: this was really a whinifical thought, and
P 2 Ire.
I reproved myfelf often for the fimplicity of it; for T
prefently faw there would be the want of feveral
things necessary to the making my beer, that it would
be impossible for me to fupply; as, firft, cafkstopre-
ferve it in, which was a thing that, as I have ob-
ferved already, I could never compafs ; no, though
I fpent not many days, but weeks, nay months, in
attempting it, but to no purpofe. In the next place,
I had no hops to make it keep, no yeaft to make it
work, no copper or kettle to make it boil; and yet,
had not all thefe things intervened, I mean the frights
and terrors I was in about the favages, I had under-
taken it, and perhaps brought it to pafs too;
for I seldom gave any thing Over without ac-
complifhing it, when I once had it in my head enough to begin it.
But my invention now ran quite another way; for
night and day I could think of nothing, but how I
might destroy fome of thefe monfters in their cruel
bloody entertainment, and, if poffible, fave the vic-
tim they would bring hither to deftroy. It would
. take up a larger volume than this whole work is in-
tended to be, to fet down all the contrivances I
hatched, or rather brooded upon.in my thoughts,.
for the deftroying thefe creatures, or at leaft frighten-
ing them, fo as to prevent their coming hither any-
more; but all was abortive; nothing could be pof-
fible to take effect, unlefs I was to be there to do it
myself ; and what could one man do among them,
. when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of
them together, with their darts, or their bows and
arrows, with which they could shoot as true to a
mark as I could with my gun?
Sometimes
Sometimes I contrived to dig an hole under the
place wherethey made their fire, and put in five or fix
pounds of gunpowder, which,when they kindled their
fire, would confequently take fire, and blow up all
that was near it; but, as in the first place I would be' very loth to wafte fo much powder upon them,
my ftore being now within the quantity of a barrel,
fo neither could I be fure of its going off at any cer-
tain time, when it might furprize them; and, at
belt, that it would do little more than juft blow the
fire about their ears, and fright them, but not fuffi-
cient to make them forfake the place; fo I laid it
afide, and then propofed, that I would place myfelf
in ambufh, in fome convenient place, with my three
guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their
bloody ceremony let fly at them, when I would be fure
to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every meet j
and then falling in upon them with my three piftols,
and my fword, I made no doubt but that, if there
were twenty, I would kill them all: this fancy pleafed
my thoughts for some weeks, and I was fo full of it
that I often dreamt of it; and fometimes, that I was
just going to let fly at them in my fleep.
I went fo far with it in my indignation, that I em-
ployed myfelf feveral days to find out proper places to
put myfelf in ambufcade, as I faid,to watch for them;
and I went frequently to the place itfelf, which was
now grown more familiar to me; and efpecially
while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of re-
venge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of
them to the fword, as I may call it; but the horror
I had at the place, and at the fignals of the barba-
P 3 rous
rous wretches devouring one another, abated my
malice.
Well, at length I found a place in the fide of the
hill, where I was fatisfied I might fecurely wait till I
faw any of the boats coming, and might then, even
before they would be ready to come on shore, convey
myfelf unfeen into thickets of trees, in one of which
there was an hollow large enough to conceal me en-
tirely; and where I might fit, and obferve all their
bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads,
when they were fo clofe together, as that it would
be next to impoffible that I should mifs my fhoot, or
that I could fail wounding three or four of them at
the first fhoot.
In this place then I refolved to fix my design ; and
accordingly I prepared two mufkets and my ordi-
nary fcwling-piece. The two mufkets I loaded with a
brace of flugs each, and four or five smaller bullets,
about the fize of piftol-bullets, and the fowling-piece
I loaded with near an handful of fvvan-fhot, of the
largeft size ; I alfo loaded my pistols with about four
bullets each: and in this pofture, well provided with
ammunition for a fecond and third charge, I prepared
myfelf for my expedition.
After I had thus laid the scheme for my defign, and
in my imagination put it in practice, I continually
made my tour every morning up to the top of the hill,
which was from my castle, as I called it, about three
miles or more, to fee if I could obferve any boats
upon the fea, coming near the ifland, or ftanding
over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had for two or three months conftantly
kept my watch; but came always-back without any
difcovery,
fiifcovery, there having not in all that time been the
leaf t appearance, not only on or near the fhore, but
not on the whole ocean, fo far as my eyes or glafles
could reach every way.
As long as "I kept up my daily tour to the hill to
look out, fo long alib I kept up the vigour of my de-
fign, and my fpirits feemed to be all the while in a
fuitable frame for fo outrageous an execution, as
the killing twenty or thirty naked savages for an
offence, which I had not at all entered into a. difcuf-
fien of in my thoughts, any further than my pafllons
were at firft fired by the horror I conceived at the
unnatural cuflom of the people of that country, who,
it feems, had been fuffered by Providence, in his
wife difpofition of the world, to have no other guide
than that of their own abominable and vitiated paf-
fions; and confequently were left, and perhaps had
been for fome ages, to act fuch horrid things, and
receive fuch dreadful customs, as nothing but nature,
entirely abandoned of Heaven, and actuated by fome
hellish degeneracy, could have run them into; but
now, when, as I have faid, I began to be weary of
the fruitlefs excurfion which I had made fo long, and
fo far, every morning in vain; fo my opinion of the
adlion itklf began to alter, and I began, with cooler
and calmer thoughts, to confider what it was I was
going to engage in; what authority or call I had
to pretend to be judge and executioner upon thefe
men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit for
fo many ages to suffer, unpunished, to go on, and
to be, as it were, the executioners of his judgments
upon one another; alfo, how far thefe people were
offenders against me, and what right I had to en-
P 4 gage •
gage in the quarrel of that blood, wh;.ch they led promifcuoufly one upon another. I debated this very
often with myfelf thus: How do I know what GOD
himfelf judges in this particular cafe? It is certain
thefe people do not commit this as a crime; it is not
against their own confciences reproving, or their
light reproaching them. They do not know it to be
an offence, and then commit it in defiance of divine
justice, as we do in almofc all the fins we commit.
They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken
in war, than we do to kill an ox; nor to eat human
flesh, than we do to eat mutton.
When I had confidered this a little, it followed
necessarily, that I was certainly in the wrong in it;
that thefe people were not murderers in the fenfe that
I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any
more than thofe Chriftians were murderers, who
often put to death the prifoners taken in battle, or
more frequently, upon many occafions, put whole
troops of men to the fword, without giving quarter,
though they threw down their arms and submitted. In the next place, it occurred to me, that albeit
. the ufage they gave one another was thus brutifh and
inhuman, yet it was really nothing to me: thefe peo-
pie had done me no injury: that if they attempted
me, or I faw it neceflary for my immediate preferva-
tion to fall upon them, something might be faid for
it; but that I was yet out of their power, and they
had really no knowledge of me, and confequently no
design upon me; and therefore it could not be juft
for me to fall upon them: that this would justify the
conduct of the Spaniards, in all their barbarities
pra&ifed in America, where they destroyed millions
of
of thefe people, who, however they were idolaters
and barbarians, and had feveral bloody and barba-
rous rites in thefe cuftoms, fuch as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards,
very innocent people; and that the rooting them out
of the country is fpoken of with the utmost abhor-
rence and deteftation, even by the Spaniards them-
felves, at this time, and by all other Christian nations
of Europe, as a mere butchery, a bloody and unnatu-
ral piece of cruelty, unjuftifiable either to GOD or
man; and fuch, as for which the very name of a
Spaniard is reckoned to be frightful and terrible to
all people of humanity, or of Christian companion:
as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent
for the product of a race of men, who were without
principles of tendernefs, or the common bowels of
pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a mark
of a generous temper in the mind.
Thefe confiderations really put me to a paufe, and
to a kind of a full ftop; and I began by little and
little to be off of my defign, and to conclude I had
taken a wrong mcafure in my refolutions to attack the
favages; that it was not my bufinefs to meddle with
them, unlefs they firft attacked me, and this it was
my bufinefs, if poffib!c,-to prevent; but that, if I
were difcovered and attacked, then I knew my duty.
On the other hand, I argued with myfelf, that
this really was the way not to deliver myfelf, but en-
tirely to ruin and destroy myfelf; for unlefs I was
fure to kill every one that not only would be on fhore
at that time, but that would ever come on more
afterwards, if but one of them efcaped to tell their
country-people what had happened, they would
come
come over again by thoufands to revenge the death
of their fellows; and I should only bring upon myfelf
a certain destruction, which at prefent I had no man-
lier of occafion for.
Upon the whole, I concluded, that neither in
principles nor in policy, I ought one way or other to
concern myfelf in this affair: that my bufinefs was,
by all poffible means to conceal myfelf from them,
and not to leave the leaft fignal to them to guefs by,
that there were any living creatures upon the ifland,
I mean of human fhape.
Religion joined in with this prudential, and I was
convinced now many ways that I was perfectly out
of my duty, when I was laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures, I mean in-
nocent as to me; as to the crimes they were guilty of
towards one another, I had nothing to do with them;
they were national punifhnients to make a just retri-
bution for national offences; and to bring public
judgments upon thofe who offend in a public manner,
by fuch ways as belt pleafe GOD.
This appeared fo clear to me now, that nothing
was a greater fatisfaction to me, than that I had not
been fuffered to do a thing which I now faw fo much
reafon to believe would have been no lefs a fin than that of wilful murder, if I had committed it; and I
gave moft humble thanks on my knees to GOD, that
had thus delivered me from blood-guiltinefs; be-
feeching him to grant me the protection of his Provi-
dence, that I might not fall into the hands of barba-
rians; or that I might not lay my hands upon them,
unlefs I had a more clear call from Heaven to do it,
in defence of my own life,
In
In this difpofition I continued for near a year after
this: and fo far was I from defiring an occafion for
falling upon thefe wretches, that in all that time I
never once went up the hill to fee whether there were
any of them in fight, or to know whether any of
them had been on more there, or not; that I might
not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances
againft them, or be provoked, by any advantage
which might prefent itfelf, to fall upon them; only
this I did, I went and removed my boat, which I
had on the other fide of the ifland, and carried it
down to the eaft end of the whole ifland, where I ran
it into a little cove which I found under fome high
rocks, and where I knew, by reafon of the currents,
the favages durft not, at leaft would not, come with
their boats upon any account whatfoever.
With my boat I carried away every thing that I
had left there belonging to her, though not neceflary
for the bare going thither; viz. a malt and fail,'which I had made for her, and a thing like an anchor, but
indeed, which could not be called either anchor or
grappling; however, it was the belt I could make of
its kind. All thefe I removed, that there might not
be the leaft fhadow of any difcovery, or any ap-
pearance of any boat, or of any habitation upon the
ifland.
Befides this, I kept myfelf, as I faid, more retired
than ever, and feldom went from my cell, other than
upon my constant employment, viz. to milk my she- goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which,
as it was quite on the other part of the island, was
quite out of danger: for certain it is, that thefe favage
people, who fometimes haunted this ifland, never
came
came with any thoughts of finding any thing here,
and confe'quemly never wandered off from the°coaft;
and I doubt not but they might have been several times on lore, after my apprehenfions of them had
made me cautious, as well as before; and indeed I
looked back with fome horror upon the thoughts of
what my condition would have been, if I had chopped
upon them, and been difcovered before that, when
naked and unarmed, except with one gun, and that
loaded often only with finall fhot. I walked every
where, peeping and peering about'the island, to fee
what I could get: what a furprize mould I have been
in, if, when I difcovered the print of a man's foot,
I had inftead of that feen fifteen cr twenty favages,
and found them purfuing me, and, by the fwiftnefs
of their running, no poffibility of my efcaping
them!
The thoughts of this fometimes funk my very foul
within me, and diftrefled my mind fo much, that I
could not foon recover it; to think what I fhould
have done, and how I not only should not have been
able to refift them, but even would not have had
prefence of mind enough to do what I might have
done; much lefs what now, after fo much confidera-
tion and preparation, I might be able to do. Indeed,
after serious thinking of thefe things, I would be very
melancholy, and fometimes it would laft a great
while; but I refolved it at laft all into thankfulnefs
to that Providence which had delivered me from fo
many unfeen dangers, and had kept me from thofe
mifchiefs, which I could no way have been the agent
in delivering myfeif from; because I had not the leaft
notion
notion of any such thing depending, or the leaft fup-
pofition of its being possible. This renewed a contemplation, which often had
come to my thoughts in former time, when firft I be-
gan to fee the merciful difpofitions of Heaven, in the
dangers we run through in this life; how wonder-
fully we are delivered when we know nothing of it:
how,whenwe are in a quandary (as we call it), a doubt
or hefitation, whether to go this way, or that way,
a fecret hint shall direct us this way, when we in-
tended to go another way; nay, when fenfe, our
own inclination, and perhaps bufinefs, has called to
go the other way, yet a strange impreffion upon the
mind, from we know not what fprings, and by we
know not what power, fhall over-rule us to go this
way; and it mall afterwards appear, that had we gone
that way which we would have gone, and even to our
imagination ought to have gone, we fhould have been
ruined and loft; upon thefe, and many like reflec-
tioiis, I afterwards made it a certain rule with me,
that whenever I found thofe fecret hints, orpreffings
of my mind, to doing or not doing any thing that
prcfented, or to going this way or that way, I never
failed to obey the fecret dictate; though I knew no-
other reafon for it, than that fuch a preflure, or fuch
an hint, hung upon my mind: I could give many
examples of the fuccefs of this conduct in the courfe
of my life; but more efpecially in the latter part of
my inhabiting this unhappy ifland; befides many
occafions which it is very likely I might have taken
notice of, if I had feen with the fame eyes then that
I faw with now: But 'tis never too late to be wife;
and I cannot but advife all considering men, whofe
lives
lives are attended with fuch extraordinary incidents
as mine, or even though not fo extraordinary, not to
flight fuch fecret intimations of Providence, let them
come from what invifible intelligence they will; that
I fhall not difcufs, and perhaps cannot account for;
but certainly they are a proof of the converfe of
spirits, and the fecret communication between thofe
embodied, and thofe unembodied; and fuch a proof
as can never be withstood : of which I mail have oc-
cafion to give fome very remarkable inftances, in
the remainder of my folitary residence in this difmal
place.
I believe the reader of this will not think it ftrange^
if I confefs that thefe anxieties, thefe constant dan-
gers I lived in, and the concern that was now upon
me, put an end to all invention, and to all the con-
trivances that I had laid for my future accommoda-
tions and conveniencies. I had the care of my fafety
more now upon my hands than that of my food. I
cared not to drive a nail, or chop a ftick of wood
now, for fear the noife I should make would be
heard; much lefs would I fire a gun, for the fame
reafon; and, above all, I was very uneafy at making
any fire, left the smoke, which is visible at a great
diftance in the day, fhould betray me; and for this
reafon I removed that part of my business, which
required fire, fuch as burning of pots and pipes, &c-
into my new apartment in the wood; where, after I
had been fome time, I found, to my unfpeakable con-
folation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went
in a vaft way, and where, I dare fay, no favage, had
he been at the mouth of it, would be fo hardy as to
venture in, nor indeed would any man elfe, but one
who,
who, like me, wanted nothing fo much as a fafe
retreat.
The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a
great rock, where, by mere accident (I would fay, if
I did not fee an abundant reafon to afcribe all fuch
things now to Providence), I was cutting down fome
thick branches of trees to make charcoal; and before
I go on, I muft obferve the reafon of my making this
charcoal, which was thus:
I was afraid of making a smoke about my habita-
tion, as I faid before; and yet I could not live there
without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c. fo I
contrived to burn fome wood here, as I had feen done
in England under turf, till it became chark, or dry
coal 5 and then putting the fire out, I preferved the
coal to carry home, and perform the other fervices,
which fire was wanting for at home, without danger
or smoke. But this by the bye: while I was cutting down fome
wood here, I perceived that behind a very thick
branch of low brushwood, or underwood, there was a
kind of hollow place: I was curious to look into it, and
getting with difficulty into the mouth of it, I found
it was pretty large, that is to fay, fufficient for me to
Rand upright in it, and perhaps another with me;
but I muft confefs to you, I made more hafte out than
I did in; when looking further into the place, which
was perfectly dark, I faw two broad mining- eyes of
fome creature, whether devil or man I knew not,
which twinkled like two ftars, the dim light from
the cave's mouth mining directly in, and making
the reflection. However,
However, after fome paufe, I recovered myself, and began to call myfelf a thoufand fools, and tell
myfelf, that he that was afraid to fee the devil, was
not fit to live twenty years in an ifland all alone, and
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this cave
that was more frightful than myfelf: upon this,
plucking up my courage, I took up a large firebrand,
and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my
hand: I had not gone three fteps in, but I was al-
most as much frightened as I was before; for I
heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in fome
pain; and it was followed by a broken noife, as if of
words half-expreffed, and then a deep figh again:
I ftepped back, and was indeed struck with fuch a
furprize, that it put me into a cold fweat; and if I
had had an hat on my head, I will not anfwer for it
that my hair might not have lifted it off. But full plucking up my fpirits ?.s well as I could, and en-
couraging myfelf a little, with considering that the
power and. prefence of GOD was every-where, and
was able to protect me; upon this I ftepped forward
again, and by the light of .the firebrand, holding it
up a little over my head, I faw lying on the ground
a moft monfcrous frightful old he-goat, just making
his will, as we fay, gafping for life, and dying in-
deed of a mere old age.
I ftirred him a little to fee if I could get him out,
and he eflayed to get up, but was not able to raife
himfelf; and I thought with myfelf, he might even
lie there; for if he had frightened me fo, he would
certainly fright any of the favages, if any of them
fhould be fo hardy as to come in there, while he had
any life in him. I was
I was how recovered from my furprife, and began
to look round me, when I found the cave was but
very small ; that is to fay, it might be about twelve
feet over, but in no manner of fhape, either round or
fquare, no hands having ever been employed in
making it but thofe of mere nature: I obferved alfo,
that there was a place at the farther fide of it that went
in farther, but fo low, that it required me to creep
upon my hands and knees to get into it, and whither
it went, I knew not; fo having no candle, I gave it
over for fome time, but refolved to come again the
next day, provided. with candles and a tinder-box,
which I had made of the lock of one of the mufquets,
with fome wildfire in the pan.
Accordingly, the next day, I came provided with
fix large candles of my own making, for I made very
good candles now of goats tallow; and going into
this low place, I was obliged to creep upon all fours,
as I have faid, almost ten yards; which, by the way}
I thought was a venture bold enough, confidering
that I knew not how far it might go, or what was
beyond it. When I was got through the ftreight,
I found the roof rofe higher up, I believe near twenty
feet; but never wfts fuch a glorious fight feen in the
ifland, I dare fay, as it was, to look round the fides
and roof of this vault or cave. The walls reflected
an hundred thoufand lights to me from my two
candles; what it was in the rock, whether diamonds,
or any other precious flones, or gold, which I rather
fuppofed it to be, I knew not.
The place I was in was a moft delightful cavity,
or grotto, of its kind, as could be expected, though
perfectly dark; the floor was dry and level, and had
VOL. I. a fort
a fort of finall loofe gravel upon it; fo that there was
no nauseous creature to be feen; neither was there
any damp or wet on the fides of the roof: the only
difficulty in it was the entrance, which, however, as
it was a place of fecurity, and fuch a retreat as I
wanted, I thought that was a convenience; fo that I
was really rejoiced at the difcovery, and refolved,
without any delay, to bring fome of thofe things
which I was moft anxious about to this place; par-
ticulaily, I refolved to bring hither my magazine of
powder, and all my fpare arms, viz. two fowling pieces i/or I had three in all) and three mufquets (for
of them I had eight in all); fo I kept at my caftle
only five, which ftood ready mounted, like pieces
I of cannon, on my outmoft fence, and were ready
'alfo to take out upon any expedition.
Upon this occafion of removing my ammunition, I
was obliged to open the barrel of powder which I
took up out of the fea, and which had been wet; and
I found, that the water had penetrated about three or
four inches into the powder on every fide, which,
caking and growing hard, had preferred the infide
like a kernel in a fhell; fo that I had near fixty
pounds of very good powder in the centre of the
cask ; and this was an agreeable difcovery to^me at
that time; fo I carried all away thither, nevefkeeping
above two or three pounds of powder with me in my
castle, for fear of a furprife of any kind; I alfo carried
thither all the lead I had left for bullets.
I fancied myfelf now like one of the antient giants,
which were faid to live in caves and holes in the rocks,
where none could come at them; for I perfuaded my-
felf while I was here, if five hundred favages were to
hunt
hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they
did, they would not venture to attack me here.
The old goat, which I found expiring, died in the
mouth of the cave the next day after I made this
discovery ; and I found it much eafier to dig a great
hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with
earth, than to drag him out: fo I interred him
there, to prevent offence to my nofe.
I was now in my twenty-third year of refidence in
this ifland, and was fo naturalized to the place, and
to the manner of living, that could I have but enjoyed
the certainty that no favages would come to the
place to difturb me, I could have been content to
have capitulated for fpending the reft of my time
there, even to the laft moment, till I had laid me
down and died, like the old goat, in the cave: I had
alfo arrived to fome little diverfions and amufements,
which made the time pafs more pleafantly with me a
great deal than it did before; as, first, I had taught
my Poll, as I noted before, to fpeak; and he did it fo
familiarly, and talked fo articulately and plain, that
it was very pleafant to me"; and he lived with me no
lefs than fix-and-twenty years: how long he might
live afterwards I knew not; though I know they
have a notion in the Brafils, that they live an hun-
dred years; perhaps fome of my polls may be alive
there ftill, calling after Poor Robin Crufoe to this
day; I wifh no Englishmanthe ill luck to come there
and hear them; but if he did, he would certainly
believe it was the devil. My dog was a very pleasant and loving companion to me for no lefs than sixteen years of my time, and then died of mere old age;
as for my cats, they multiplied, as I have obferved,
2 tO
to that degree, that I was obliged to meet several of them at first, to keep them from devouring me3
and all I had; but at length, when the two old ones
I brought with me were gone, and after fome time
continually driving them from me, and letting them
have no provifion with me, they all ran wild into
the woods, except two or three favourites, which I
kept tame, and whofe young, when they had any, I
always drowned, and thefe were part of my family:
bolides thefe, I always kept two or three houfehold
kids about me, which I taught to feed out of my
hand; and I had alfo more parrots which talked
pretty well, and would all call Robin Crusoe,but none
like my firft; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with
any of them that I had done with him: I had alfo
'feveral tame fea-fowls, whofe names I know not,
which I caught upon the more, and cut their wings;
and the little flakes, which I had planted before my
caftle wall, being now grown up to a good thick
grove, thefe fowls all lived among thefe low trees,
and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; fo
that, as I laid above, I began to be very well con-
tented with the life I led, if it might but have been
secured from the dread of favages.
But it was otherwife directed; and it might not be
amifs for all people who mail meet with my story to
make this quit obfervation from it, viz. How fre-
quently, in the courfe of our lives, the evil, which
in itfelf we feek moft to fhun, and which, when we
are fallen into, is the moft dreadful to us, is often-
times the very means or door of our deliverance, by
which alone we can be raifed again from the afflic-
tion we are fallen into: I could give many examples
of
of this in the courfe of my unaccountable life; but
in nothing was it more particularly remarkable, than
in the circumftances of my laft years of folitary re-
fidence in this ifland.
It was now the month of December, as I faid above,
in my twenty-third year; and this being the fouthern
folftice, for winter I cannot call it, was the particular
time of my harveft, and required my being pretty
much abroad in the fields; when going out pretty
early in the morning, even before it was thorough
day-light, I was furprifed with feeing a light of fome
fire upon the more, at a diftance from me of about
two miles, towards the end of the ifland, where I had
obferved fome favages had been, as before; but not
on the other fide; but, to my great affliction, it was
on my fide of the ifland.
I was indeed terribly furprifed at the fight, and
flopped fhort within my grove, not daring to go out,
left I might be furprifed; and yet I had no more peace
within, from the apprehenfions I had, that if thefe
favages, in rambling over the ifland, fhould find my
corn ftanding, or cut, or any of my works and im-
provements, they would immediately conclude that
there were people in the place, and would then never
give over till they found me out; in this extremity
I went back directly to my caftle, pulled up the lad-
der after me, having made all things without look as
wild and natural as I could. •
Then I prepared myfelf within, putting myfelf in a
posture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, as I
called them, that is to fay, my mufquets, which were
mounted upon my new fortification, and all my piftols,
and refolved to defend myself to the laft gafp; not
. forgetting
forgetting ferioufly to recommend myfelf to the divine protection, and earneftly to pray to GOD to deliver
me out of the hands of the barbarians; and in this
posture I continued about two hours, but began to be
mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had
no fpies to fend out.
After fitting a while longer, and mufmg what I
fhould do in this cafe, I was not able to bear fitting
in ignorance longer; fo letting up my ladder to the
fide of the hill, where there was a flat place, as I
obferved before, and then pulling the ladder up after
me, I fet it up again, and mounted to the top of the
hill; and, pulling out my perspective glafs, which I
had taken on purpofe, I laid me down flat on my
belly on the ground, and began to look for the
place: I prefently found there were no lefs than
nine naked favages fitting round a fmall fire they had
made; not to warm them, for they had no need of
that, the weather being extreme hot; but, as I fup*
pofed, to drefs fome of their barbarous diet of human
flefh which they had brought with them, whether
alive or dead I could not know.
They had two canoes with them, which they had
haled up upon the fhore; and as it was then tide of
ebb, they feemed to me to wait the return of the
flood to go away again. It is not eafy to imagine
what confufion this fight put me into, efpecially feeing
• them come on my fide the island, and fo near me
too ; but when I obferved their coming mutt be al-
ways with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards
to be more fedate in my mind, being fatisfied that I
might go abroad with fafety all the time of tide of
flood, if they were not on lore before 5 and having
made
made this obfervation, I went abroad about my har-
vest work with the more compofure.
As I expected, fo it proved; for as foon as the tide
made to the weftward, I faw them all take boat, and
row (or paddle, as we call it) all away: I fhould have
cbferved, that for an hour and more befcre they went
off, they went to dancing, and I could easily difcern
their poftures and geftures by my glafles: I could
only perceive, by my niceft obfervation, that they
were lark naked, and had not the leafy covering
upon them; but whether they were men or women
that I could not diftinguiih.
As foon as I faw them fhipped and gone, I took two
guns upon my shoulders, and two pistols at my girdle,
and my great fword by my fide, without a fcabbard;
and with all the fpeed I was able to make, I went
away to the hill, where I had difcovered the firft ap-
pearance of all. As foon as I got thither, which was
not lefs than two hours (for I could not go apace, be-
ing fo loaded with arms as I was), I perceived there had
been three canoes more of favages on that place; and
looking out further, I faw they were all at fea to-
gether, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful fight to me, efpecially, when
going down to the shore, I could fee the marks of
horror which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it, viz. the blood, the bones, and
part of the flefh of human bodies, eaten and devoured
by thofe wretches with merriment and fport. I
was fo filled with indignation at the fight, that I be-
gan now to premeditate the destruction of the next
that I faw there, let them be who or how many foever.
It feemed evident to me, that the vifits which they
thus made to this island were not very frequent;
for it was above fifteen months before any more of
them came on lore there again; that is to fay, I
never faw them, or any footfteps or fignals of them,
in all that time; for as to the rainy feafons, then they
are fure not to come abroad, at leaft not fo far; yet
all this while I lived uncomfortably, by reafon of the
constant apprehenfions I was in of their coming upon
me by furprife; from whence I obferve, that the
expectation of evil is more bitter than the suffering, efpecially if there is no room to fhake oft" that expec-
tation or thofe apprehenfions.
During all this time, I was in the murdering hu-
mour; and took up moft of my hours, which would have been better employed, in contriving how to
circumvent and fall upon them the very next time I
mould fee them; efpecially if they fhould be di-
vided, as they were the laft time, into two parties;
nor did I confider at all, that if I killed one party,
fuppofe ten or a dozen, I was full the next day, or
week, or month, to kill another, and fo another,
even ad infinitum, till I would be at length no lefs
a murderer than they were in being men-eaters, and
perhaps much more fo.
I fpent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I would one day or
other fall into the hands of thofe mercilefs creatures;
if I did at any time venture abroad, it was not with-
out looking round me with the greateft care and
caution imaginable; and now I found, to my great
comfort, how happy it was that I had provided a tame
'flock
flock or herd of goats; for I durft not, upon any
account, fire my gun, efpecially near that fide of the
ifland where they ufually came, left I would alarm
the favages; and if they had fled from me now, I was
fure to have them come back again, with perhaps two
or three hundred canoes with them in a few days, and
then I knew what to expect.
However, I wore out a year and three months
more before I ever faw any more of the favages, and
then I found them again, as I mail foon obferve. It
is true, they might have been there once or twice,
but either they made no ftay, or, at leaft, I did not
hear them; but in the month of May, as near as I
could calculate, and in my four and twentieth year,
I had a very ftrange encounter with them, of which
in its place.
The perturbation of my mind, during this fifteen
or fixteen months interval, was very great; I flept
unquiet, dreamed always frightful dreams, and often
ftarted out of my fleep in the night; in the day great
troubles overwhelmed my mind; in the night I
dreamed often of killing the favages, and the reafons
why I might juftify the doing of it: but to wave all
this for a while, it was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden
calendar would reckon, for I marked all upon the
poft ftill; I fay, it was on the fixteenth of May, that
it blew a great storm of wind all day, with a great
deal of lightning and thunder, and a very foul night
was after it: I know not what was the particular
occafion of it; but as I was reading in the bible, and
taken up with ferious thoughts about my prefent con-
dition,
dition, I was furprifed with the noife of a gun, as I
thought, fired at fea.
This was, to be fure, a furprife of a quite different
nature from any I had met with before; for the no-
tions this put into my thoughts were quite of another
kind: I started up in the greateft Mite imaginable;
and in a trice clapped up my ladder to the middle
place of the rock, and pulled it after me, and mount-
ing it the fecond time, got to the top of the hill; that
very moment a flash of fire bade me listen for a fecond
gun, which accordingly in about half a moment I
heard, and by the found knew that it was from that
part of the fea where I was driven out with the cur-
rent in my boat.
I immediately confidered that this muft be fome
fhip in diftrefs, and that they had fome comrade, or
fome other fhip in company, and fii ed thefe guns for
fignals of distress, and to obtain help: I had this
prefence of mind at that minute, as to think, that
though I could hot help them, it may be they might
help me; fo I brought together all the dry wood I
could get at hand, and making a good handfome
pile, I fet it on fire upon the hill; the wood was
dry, and blazed freely, and though the wind blew
very hard, yet it burnt fairly out, fo that I was cer-
tain, if there was any fuch thing as a lip, they muft
need fee it, and no doubt they did; for as foon as
ever my fire blazed up, I heard another gun, and
after that feveral others, all from the fame quarter, I plied my fire all night long, till day broke; and
when it was broad day, and the air cleared up, I faw
fomething at a great distance at fea, full eaft of the
ifland,
jfland, whether a fail, or an hull, I could not diftin-
guifh, no not with my glaffes, the distance was fo
great, and the weather ftill fomething hazy alfo; at
leaft it was fo out at fea.
I looked frequently at it all that day, and foon per-
ceived that it did not move; fo I prefently concluded
that it was a ship at anchor; and being eager, you
may be fure, to be fatisfied, I took my gun in my
hand, and ran towards the fouth-eaft fide of the
island, to the rocks, where I had been formerly carried
away with the current; and getting up there, the
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could
plainly fee, to my great forrow, the wreck of a mip
caft away in the night upon thofe concealed rocks
which I found when I was out in my boat; and which
rocks, as they checked the violence of the ftream,
and made a kind of counter-ftream, or eddy, were
the occafion of my recovering then from the moft
jdefperate hopelefs condition that ever I had been in
all my life.
Thus, what is one man's fafety is another man's
deftruflion; for it feems thefe men, whoever they
were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon
them in the night, the wind blowing hard at E. and
£. N. E. Had they feen the ifland, as I muft necef-
farily fuppofe they did not, they muft, as I thought,
have endeavoured to have faved themfelves on more
by the help of their boat; but the firing of their
guns for help, efpecially when they faw, as I ima-
gined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts: first, I imagined, that, upon feeing my light, they might
have put themfelves into their boat, and have en-
deavoured
deavourcd to make the shore ; but that the fea going
very high, they might have been caft away; other
times I imagined, that they might have loft their
boat before, as might be the cafe many ways; as
particularly, by the breaking of the fea upon their
fhip, which many times obliges men to stave, or take
in pieces their boat; and fometimes to throw it over-
board with their own hands: other times I imagined,
they had fome other ship or mips in company, who,
upon the fignals of diftrefs they had made, had taken
them up, and carried them off: other whiles I fan-
cied they were all gone off to fea in their boat, and
being hurried away by the current that I had been
formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean,
where there was nothing but mifery and periming;
and that perhaps they might by this time think of
starving, and of being in a condition to eat one
another.
As all thefe were but conjectures at belt, fo, in
the condition I was in, I could do no more than look
upon the mifery of the poor men, and pity them;
which had full this good effect on my fide, that it
gave me more and morecaufeto give thanks to GOD,
who had fo happily and comfortably provided for me
in my defolate condition; and that of two mips com-
panies, who were now caft away upon this part of the
world, not one life would be fpared but mine. I
learnt here again to obferve, that it is very rare that
the providence of GOD cafts us into any condition of
life fo low, or any mifery fo great, but we may fee
fomething or other to be thankful for, and may fee
others in worfe circumftances than our own.
Such
Such certainly was the cafe of thefe men, of
whom I could not fo much as fee room to fuppofe any
of them were faved; nothing could make it rational,
fo much as to wifh or expect that they did not all
perifh there, except the possibility only of their being
taken up by another ship in company: and this was
but mere poffibility indeed; for I faw not the leaft
fignal or appearance of any fuch thing.
I cannot explain, by any poffible .energy of words,
what a ftrange longing, or hankering of defire, I felt
in my foul upon this fight; breaking out sometimes thus: O that there had been but one or two, nay,
'but one foul faved out of the flap, to have efcaped
to me, that I might but have had one companion,
one fellow-creature to have fpoken to me, and to
have converfed with! In all the time of my solitary life, I never felt fo earneft, fo strong a defire after
the fociety of my fellow-creatures, or fo deep a re-
gret at the want of it. •
There are fome fecret moving fprings in the affec-
tions, which, when they are fet a going by fome
objectin view, or be it fome object though not in view,
yet rendered prefent to the mind by the power of
imagination, that motion carries out the foul by its
impetuofity to fuch violent eager embracings of the
object, that the abfence of it is infupportable.
Such were thefe earneft wifhings, That but one
man had been faved! O that it had been but one! I
believe I repeated the words, O that it had been but
one! a thoufand times; and my defires were fo moved
by it, that when I fpoke the words, my hands would
clinch together, and my fingers prefs the palms of my
hands, that if I had had any foft thing in my hand,
•it
it would have crufhed it involuntarily; and my teeth
in my head would strike together, and fet against one
another fo ftrong, that for fome time I could not part
them again.
Let the naturalists explain thefe things, and the
reason and manner of them: all I can fay of them
is, to defcribe the fact, which was ever furprifmg to
me when I found it, though I knew not from what
it fhould proceed; it was doubtless the effect of ar-
dent wifhes, and of strong ideas formed in my mind,
realizing the comfort which the converfation of one
of my fellow-chriftians would have been to me.
But it was not to be; either their fate, or mine,
or both, forbad it; for till the laft year of my being
on this island, I never knew whether anv were faved
'rf
out of that fhip, or no; and had only the affliction fome days after to fee the corpfe of a drowned boy
come on more, at the end of the island which was
next the fhipwreck: he had on no clothes but a
feaman's waiftcoat, a pair of open-kneed linen
drawers, and a blue linen fhirt; but nothing to direct
me fo much as to guefs what nation he was of: he
had nothing in his pocket but two pieces of eight,
and a tobacco-pipe; the laft was to me of ten times
more value than the first. It was now calm, and I had a great mind to ven-
ture oufin my boat to this wreck, not doubting but I
might find fomething on board that might be ufeful
to me; but that did not altogether prefs me fo much,
as the possibility that there might be yet fome living
creature on board, whofe life I might not only fave,
but might, by faving that life, comfort my own to
the laft degree: and this thought clung fo to my
heart,
heart, that I could not be quiet night nor day, but I
muft venture out in my boat on board this wreck;
and committing the reft to GOD'S providence, I
thought the impreffion was fo ftrong upon my mind,
that it could not be refilted, that it muft come from
fome invifible direction, and that I would be want-
ing to myfelf if I did not go.
Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my caftle, prepared every thing for my
voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot for
fresh water, a compafs to fteer by, a bottle of rum
(for I had ftill a great deal of that left), a basket full
of raifins: and thus loading myfelf with every thing
necelTary, I went down to my boat, got the water
out of her, and got her afloat, loaded all my cargo
in her, and then went home again for more: my
fecond cargo was a great bag full of rice, the um-
brella to fet up over my head for fhade, another
large pot full of frefh water, and about two dozen of
my fmall loaves, or barley-cakes, more than before,
with a bottle of goats milk, and a cheefe; all which,
with great labour and fweat, I brought to my boat;
and praying to GOD to direct my voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the canoe along the more, I
came at laft to the utmoft point of the ifland, on that
'fide, viz. N. E. And now I was to launch out
into the ocean, and either to venture, or not to ven-
ture; I looked on the rapid currents which ran con-
ftantly on both fides of the ifland, at a diftance, and
which were very terrible to me, from the remem-
brance of the hazard I had been in before, and my
heart began to fail me; for I forefaw, that if I was
driven into either of thofe currents, I would be car-
ried
ried a vast way out to fea, and perhaps out of
reach, or fight of the ifland again; and that then, as
my boat was but fmall, if any little gale of wind
Gould rife, I should be inevitably loft*
Thefe thoughts fo opprefled my mind, that I began
to give over my enterprife, and having haled my boat
into a little creek on thefhore, I ftepped out, and fat-
me down upon a little fpot of rifmg ground, very
pensive and anxious, between fear and defire, about
my voyage; when, as I was musing, I could perceive
that the tide was turned, and the flood came on,
upon which my going was for fo many hours imprac-
ticable: upon this it prefently occurred to me, that
I would go up to the higheft piece of ground I could
find, and obferve, if I could, how the fets of the tide
or currents lay, when the flood came in, that I might
judge whether, if I was driven one way out, I might
not expect to be driven another way home, with the
fame rapidnefs of the currents: this thought was no
fooner in my head, but I caft my eye upon a little
hill which fufficiently overlooked the fea both ways,
and from whence I had a clear view of the currents,
or fets of the tide, and which way I was to guide
myfelf in my return: here I found, that as the cur-
rent of the ebb fet out clofe by the fouth point of the
ifland, fo the current of the flood fet in clofe by the
more' of the north-fide; and that I had nothing to do
but to keep to the north of the island in my. return,
and I would do well enough.
Encouraged with this obfervation, I refolved the
next morning to fet out with the firft of the tide; and
. repofmg myfelf for that night in the canoe, under
the great watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out;
I made
I made first a little out to fea full north, till I began
to feel the benefit of the current, which fet eaftward,
and which carried me at a great rate, and yet did not
fo hurry me as the fouthern fide current had done
before, and fo as to take from me all government of
the boat; but having a strong steerage with my pad-
dle, I went, I fay, at a great rate, directly for the
wreck, and in lefs than two hours I came up to it.
It was a dismal fight to look at: the fhip, which
by its building was Spanish,ftuck faft, jambed in
between two rocks; all the ftern and quarter of her
was beaten to pieces with the fea; and as her fore castle, which ftuck in the rocks, had run on with
great violence, her mainmast and foremast were
brought by the board, that is to fay, broken fhort
off, but her boltfprit was found, and the head and
bow appeared firm: when I came clofe to her, a
dog appeared upon her, which, feeing me coming,
yelped and cried, and as foon as I called him, jumped
into the fea to come to me; and I took him into the
boat, but found him almoft dead for hunger and
thirst : I gave him a cake of my bread, and he ate
like a ravenous wolf that had been starving a fort-
night in the fnow: I then gave the poor creature
fome frefh water, with which, if I would have let
him, he would have burft himfelf.
'After this I went on board; the firft fight I met
with was two men drowned in the cook-room, or
forecaftle of the lip, with their arms faft about one
another. I concluded, as is indeed probable, that
when the fhip flruck, it being in a storm, the fea
broke fo high, and fo continually over her, that the
men were not able to bear it, and were ftrangled with
VOL. I.. R the
the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if
they had been under water: befides the dog, there
was nothing left in the fhip that had life, nor any
goods that I could fee, but what were fpoiled by the
water: there were fome cafks of liquor, whether
wine or brandy I knew not, which lay lower in the
hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I could
fee; but they were too big to meddle with: I faw
feveral chefts, which I believed belonged to fome of
the feamen, and I got two of them into the boat with-
out examining what was in them.
Had the ftern of the fhip been fixed, and the fore
part broken off, I am perfuaded I might have made
a good voyage; for by what I found in thefe two
chefts, I had room to fuppofe the fhip had a great
deal of wealth on board; and if I may guefs by the
courfe flie fteered, me muft have been bound from
the Buenos Ayres, or the Rio de la Plata, in the
fouth part of America, beyond the Brafils, to the
Havanna, in the gulph of Mexico, and fo perhaps
to Spain: me had, no doubt, a great treafure in her,
but of no ufe at that time to any body; and what
became of the reft of her people 1 then knew not.
I found, befides . thefe chests, a little cask full of
liquor, of about twenty gallons, which I got into my
boat with much difficulty: there were feveral muf-
quets in a cabin, and a great powder-horn, with
about four pounds of powder in it; as for the muf-
quets, I had no occafion for them, fo I left them,
but took the powder-horn: I took a fire-movel and
tongs, which I wanted extremely ; as alfo two little
brafs kettles, a copper pot to make chocolate, and a
grid-iron; and with this cargo, and the dog, I came
away,
, the tide beginning to make home again; and
the fame evening, about an hour within night, I
reached the ifland again, weary and fatigued to the
laft degree.
I repofed that night in the boat, and in the morn-
ing I refolved to harbour what I had gotten in my
new cave, not to carry it home to my castle : after
refrefhing myfelf, I got all my cargo on more, and
began to examine the particulars: the cafk of liquor
I found to be a kind of rum, but not fuch as we had
at the Brafils; and, in a word, not at all good; but
when I came to open the chefts, I found feveral
things which I wanted: for example, I found in one
a fine cafe of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and
filled with cordial waters, fine, and very good; the
bottles held about three pints each, and were tipped
with filver; I found two pots of very good fuccades,
or fweetmeats, fo faftened alfo on the top, that the
fait water had not hurt them; and two more of the
fame, which the water had fpoiled: I found fome
very good fhirts, which were very welcome to me,
and about a dozen and an half of white linen hand-
kerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths; the former were
alfo very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to
wipe my face in an hot day; befides this, when I
came to the till in the chefts, I found there three great
bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven
hundred pieces in 'all; and in one of them, wrapt
up in a paper, fix doubloons of gold, and fome finall
bars or wedges of gold; I fuppofe they might all
weigh near a pound.
The other cheft I found had fome clothes in it, but
of little value ; but by the circumftances, it muft have
R z belonged
belonged to the gunner's mate, as there was no pow-
der fin it, but about two pounds of glazed pow-
der in the three flafks, kept, I fuppofe, for charg-
ing their fowling-pieces on occafion : upon the whole,
I got very little by this voyage that was of much ufe
to me; for as to the. money, I had no manner of
occafion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my
feet; and I would have given it all for three or four
pair of Englishfhoes and ftockings, which were things
I greatly wanted, but had not had on my feet now
for many years; I had, indeed, got two pair of
fhoes now, which I took off the feet of the two
drowned men whom I faw in the wreck; and I
I found two pair more in one of the chefts, which
were very welcome to me; but they were not like our
Englijh fhoes, either for eafe or fervice, being rather
what we call pumps than fhoes: I found in the fea-
man's cheft about fifty pieces of eight in royals, but
no gold; I fuppofe this belonged to a poorer man
than the other, which feemed to belong to fome-
officer.
Well, however, I lugged the money home to my
cave, and laid it up, as I had done that before,
which I brought from our own fhip; but it was great
pity, as I faid, that the other part of the map had not-
come to my fhare, for I am fatisfied I might have
loaded my canoe feveral times over with money,
which, if I had ever efcaped to England, would have
lain here fafe enough till I might have come again
and fetched it.
Having now brought all my things on more, and
fecured them, I went back to my boat, and rowed or
paddled her along the fhore to her old harbour, where
I laid
I laid her up, and made the beft of my way to my old
habitation, where I found every thing fafe and quiet;
fo I began to repofe myfelf, live after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for a while I
lived eafy enough; only that I was more vigilant
than I ufed to be, looked out oftener, and did not go
abroad fo much; and if at any time I did stir with
any freedom, it was always to the earl part of the
island, where I was pretty well fatisfied the favages
never came, and where I could go without fo many
precautions, and fuch a load of arms and ammuni-
tion as I always carried with me, if I went the other
way.
I lived in this condition near two years more; but
my unlucky head, that was always to let me know it
was born to make my body miferable, was all thefe
two years filled with projects and defigns, how, if it
were poffible, I might get away from this ifland; for
fometimes I was for making another voyage to the
wreck, though my reafon told me, that there was
nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage:
fometimes for a ramble one way, fometimes another;
and I believe verily, if I had had the boat that I went
from Sallee in, I would have ventured to fea, bound
any where, I knew not whither.
I have been, in all my circumftances, a memento
to thofe who are touched with that general plague of
mankind, whence, for aught I know, one half of
their miferies flow; I mean, that of not being fatis-
fied with the ftation wherein GOD and nature hath
placed them; for, not to look back upon my primi-
tive condition, and the excellent advice of my father,
the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my
R 3 original
original fin, my fubfequent miftakes of the fame kind
have been the means of my coming into this mife-
rable condition; for had that Providence, which fo
happily had feated me. at the Brafils as a planter,
blessed me with confined defires, and could I have
been contented to have gone on gradually, I might
have been by this time, I mean in the time of my
being on this ifland, one of the moft confiderable
planters in the Brafils; nay, I am perfuaded, that
by the improvements I had made in that little time I
lived there, and the increafe I fhould probably have
made if I had stayed, I might have been worth an
hundred^thoufand moidores; and what bufmefs had
I to leave a fettled fortune, well-flocked plantation,
improving and increafing, to turn fupercargo to
Guinea, to fetch Negroes, when patience and time
would have fo increafed our ftock at home, that we
could have bought them at our own doors, from
thofe whofe bufmefs it was to fetch them? And
though it had coft us fomething more, yet the differ-
ence of that price was by no means .worth faving at
fo great a hazard.
But as this is ordinarily the fate of young heads, fo
. reflection upon the folly of it is as ordinarily the exercife of more years, or of the dear-bought expe-
rie.ice of time; and fo it was with me now ; and yet,
fo deep had the mistake taken root in my temper,
that I could not fatisfy myfelf in my ftation, but was
continually poring upon the means and possibility of
my efcape from this place; and that I may, with the
greater pleafure to the reader, bring on the remain-
ing part of my story, it may not be improper to give
fome account of my firft conceptions on the subject of
this
this foolifh fcheme for my efcape; and how, and
upon what foundation, I acted.
I am now to be fuppofed to be retired into my
caftle, after my late voyage to the wreck, my frigate
laid up, and fecured under water as ufual, and my
condition reftored to what it was before: I had
more wealth, indeed, than I had before, but was not
at all the richer; for I had no more ufe for it than
the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came
thither.
It was one of the nights, in the rainy feafon in
March, the four-and-tvventieth year of my first fetting
foot in this ifland of folitarinefs, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, and very well in health,
had no pain, no distemper, no uneafinefs of body, no, nor any uneafinefs of mind more than ordinary,
but could by no means clofe my eyes, that is, fo as
to fleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwife
than as follows:
It is as impossible, as needlefs, to fet down the innu,
merable crowd of thoughts that whirled through that
great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this
night's time: I ran over the whole history of my life
in miniature, or by abridgment, as I may call it, to
my coming to this island ; and alfo of that part of
my life force I came to this ifland; in my reflec-
tions upon the ftate of my cafe, fince I came on
fhore on this island ; I was comparing the happy
pofture of my affairs, in the firft years of my habita-
tion here, to that courfe of anxiety, fear and care,
which I had lived in ever fmce I had feen the print of
a foot in the fand; not that I did not believe the fava-
ges had frequented the ifland even all the while, and
might have been feveral hundreds of them at times
R 4 on
on the fhore there; but as I had never known it, and
was incapable of any apprehenfions about it, my
fatisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the
fame; and I was as happy in not knowing my dan-
ger, as if I had never really been expofed to it; this
furnifhed my thoughts with many very profitable
reflections, and particularly this one: How infinitely
good that Providence is, which has fettled in its
government of mankind fuch narrow bounds to his
fight and knowledge of things; and though he walks
in the midst of fo many thoufand dangers, the fight
of which, if difcovered to him, would distract his
mind, and fink his fpirits, he is kept ferene and
calm, by having the events of things hid from his
eyes, and knowing nothing of the dangers which fur-
round him.
After thefe thoughts had for fome time entertained
me, I came to reflect ferioufly upon the real danger
I had been in for fo many years in this very if! and;
and how I had walked about in the greatest fecurity,
and with ail poffible tranquillity, even perhaps when
nothing but a brow on a hill, a great tree, or the
cafual approach of night, had been between me and
the worft kind of destruction, viz. that of falling
into the hands of canibals and favages, who would
have feized on me with the fame view as I did on a
goat or a turtle, and have thought it no more a crime
to kill and devour me, than I did of a pigeon or a
curlieu; I mould unjuftly flander myfelf, if I would fay I was not fincerely thankful to my great Preferver,
to whofe fingular protection I acknowledged, with
great humility, that all thefe unknown deliveran-
ces were due, and without which I mould inevitably
have fallen into their mercilefs hands.
When
When thefe thoughts were over, my head was for
Tome time taken up in confidering the nature of thefe
wretched creatures, I mean, the favages; and how
it came to pafs in the world, that the wife Governor
of all things would give up any of his creatures to
fuch inhumanity, nay, to fomething fo much below
even brutality itfelf, as to devour its own kind: but as this ended in fome (at that time fruitlefs) fpecula-
tions, it occurred to me to inquire what part of the
world thefe wretches lived in; how far off the coal was from whence they came; what they ventured fo
far from home for; what kind of boats they had;
and why I might not order myfelf, and my bufmefs
fo, that I might be as able to go over thither, as they
were to come to me,
I never fo much as troubled myfelf to consider, what I would do with myfelf when I came thither;
what should become of me if I fell into the hands of
the favages; or how I would efcape from them, if
they attempted me; no, nor fo much as how it was
poffible for me to reach the coaft, and not be attacked
by fome or other of them, without any possibility of
delivering myfelf; and if I would not fall into their
hands, what I would do for provifion, or whither T
should bend my courfe; none of thefe thoughts, I
fay, fo much as came in my way; but my mind was
wholly bent upon the notion of my palling over in
my boat to the main land: I looked back upon my
prefent condition as the most miferable that could
possibly be; that I was not able to throw myfelf into
any thing but death that could be called worfe; that
if I reached the more of the main, I might, perhaps,
meet with relief; or I might coaft along, as I did on
'the
r*
the chore of Africa, till I came to fome inhabited
country, and where I might find fome relief; and
after all, perhaps, I might fall in with fome Chriftian
fhip that might take me in; and if the worft came
totheworft, I could but die, which would put an end
to all thefe miferies at once. Pray, note, all this
was the fruit of a disturbed mind, an impatient tem-
per, made, as it were, defperate by the long con,
tinuance of my troubles, and the difappointments I
had met in the wreck I had been on board of, and
where I had been fo near the obtaining of what I fo
earneftly longed for, viz. somebody to speak to, and
to learn fome knowledge from of the place where I
was, and of the probable means of my deliverance;
I fay, I was agitated wholly by thefe thoughts. All
my calm of mind in my refignation to Providence,
and waiting the iffue of the difpofitions of Heaven,
feemed to be fufpehded; and I had, as it were, no
power to turn my thoughts to any thing but the pro-
iecl of a voyage to the main; which came upon me
with fuch force, and fuch an impetuofity of define, that it was not to be refuted. When this had agitated my thoughts for two hours
or more, with fuch violence, that it let my very blood
into a ferment, and my pulfe beat as high as if I had
been in a fever, merely with the extraordinary fer-
vour of my mind about it; nature, as if I had been
fatigued and exhaufted with the very thought of it,
threw me into a found fleep: one would have thought
I fhould have dreamed of it; but I did not, nor of
any thing relating to it; but I dreamed, that as I was
going out in the morning, as ufual, from my. caftle,
I faw upon the fliore two canoes, and eleven favages
coming coming to land, and that they brought with them
another favage, whom they were going to kill, in or-
der to eat him; when on a fudden, the favage that
they were going to kill jumped away, and ran for his
life; then I thought in my sleep, that he came running
into my little thick grove, before my fortification, to
hide himfelf; and that I feeing him alone, and not
perceiving that the others fought him that way,
fhewedmyfelf to him, and smiling upon him, encou-
raged him: that he kneeled down to me, feeming to
pray me to afflict him; upon which I mewed my lad-
der, made him go up it, and carried him into my
cave, and he became my fervant; and that as foon as
I had got this man, I faid to myfelf, Now I may
certainly venture to the main land; for this fellow will
ferve me as a pilot, and will tell me what to do, and
whither to go for provifions, and whither not to go
for fear of being devoured; what places to venture
into, and what to efcape. I waked with this
thought, and was under fuch inexpreffible impremons
of joy at the prospect of my efcape in my dream, that
the difappointments which I felt upon coming to my-
felf, and finding it was no more than a dream, were
equally extravagant the other way, and threw me into
y. very great dejection of fpirit.
Upon this, however, I made this conclusion, that
my only way to go about an attempt for an efcape,
was, if poffible, to get a favage in my poffeffion; and,
if poffible, it would be one of their prifoners whom
they had condemned to be eaten, and fhould bring
hither to kill; but thefe thoughts ftill were attended
with this difficulty, that it was impossible to effect
this, without attacking a whole caravan of them, and
killing
killing them all; and this was not only a very
defperate attempt, and might mifcarry; but, on the
other hand, I had greatly fcrupled the lawfulnefs of
it to me, and my heart trembled at the thoughts of
shedding fo much blood, though it was for my de-
liverance: I need not repeat the arguments which
occurred to me againft this, they being the fame
mentioned before: but though I had other reafons to
offer now, viz. that thofe men were enemies to my
life, and would devour me, if they could; that it was
felf-prefervation, in the highest degree, to deliver my-
felf from this death of a life, and was acting in my own
defence, as much as if they were actually afiaulting
me, and the like; I fay, though thefe things argued
for it, yet the thoughts of fhedding human blood
for my deliverance were very terrible to me, and fuch
as I could by no means reconcile myself to a great
while.
However, at laft, after many fecret difputes with
myfelf, and after great perplexities about it (for all
thefe arguments, one way and another, struggled in
my head a long time), the eager prevailing defire of
deliverance at length maftered all the reft, and I re.
folved, if possible, to get one of thefe favages into my
hands, col what it would: the next thing then was
to contrive how to do it; and this indeed was very
difficult to refolve on: but as I could pitch upon no
probable means for it, fo I refolved to put myfelf
upon the watch to fee them when they came on more,
and leave the reft to the event, taking fuch meafures
us the opportunity should present, let it be what it
would.
With
With thefe refolutions in my thoughts, I fet myfelf
upon the fcout as often as poffible, and indeed fo
often, till I was heartily tired of it; for it was above
a year and an half that I waited, and for a great part of
that time went out to the weft end, and to the fouth-
ills corner of the ifland, almoft every day, to fee the
canoes, but none appeared: this was very difcourag-
ing, and began to trouble me much; though I can't
fay that it did in this cafe, as it had done fome time
before that, viz. wear off the edge of my defire to the
thing; but the longer it feemed to be delayed, the
more eager I was for it: in a word, I was not at first more careful to shun the fight of thefe favages, and
avoid being feen by them, than I was now eager to
be upon them.
Befides, I fancied myfelf able to manage one, nay,
two or three favages, if I had them, fo as to make
them entirely flaves to me, to do whatever I should direct them, and to prevent their being able, at any
time, to do me any hurt: it was a great while that
pleafed myfelf with this affair, but nothing ftill
prefented; all my fancies and fchemes came to
nothing, for no favages came near me for a great
while.
About a year and an half after I had entertained
thefe notions, and, by long musing, had, as it were
refolved them all into nothing, for want of an occasion to put them in execution, I was furprifed one morn-
ing early, with feeing no lefs than five canoes all on
more together, on my fide the ifland, and the people
who belonged to them all landed, and out of my
fight: the number of them broke all my meafures;
for feeing fo many, and knowing that they always
came
came four, or fix, or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell what to think of it, or how to take my
meafures to attack twenty or thirty men fingle-
handed; fo I lay fl.il! in my castle, perplexed and
difcomforted; however, I put myfelf into all the
fame polures for an attack that I had formerly pro-
vided, and was just ready for action, if any thing
had prefented: having waited a good while, liftening
to hear if they made any noife; at length being very
impatient, I fet my guns at the foot of my ladder, and
clambered up to the top of the hill by my two ftages,
as ufual; ftanding fo, however, that my head did not
appear above the hill, fo that they could not perceive
me by any means: here I obferved, by the help of
my perspective glafs, that they were no lefs thirty in
number; that they had a fire kindled, and that they
had had meat dressed ; how they cooked it, that I
knew not, or what it was; but they were all dancing
in I know not how many barbarous geftures and
figures, their own way, round the fire. •
When I was thus looking on them, I perceived by
my perspective two miferable wretches dragged from
the boats, where, it feems, they were laid by, and
were now brought out for the flaughter: I perceived
one of them immediately fall, being knocked down,
I fuppofe, with a club or wooden fword, for that was
their way; and two or three others were at work im-
mediately, cutting him open for their cookery, while
the other victim was left flanding by himfelf, till they
would be ready for him: in that very moment this
poor wretch, feeing himfelf a little at liberty, nature
infpired him with hopes of life, and he ftarted away
from them, and ran with incredible fwiftnefs along
the
the fands, directly towards me, I mean, towards that
part of the coast where my habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I muft acknow-
ledge) when I perceived him to run my way; and
efpecially when, as I thought, I faw him purfued by
the whole body; and now I expected that part of
my dream was coming to pafs, and that he would
certainly take flicker in my grove; but I could not
depend, by any means, upon my dream for the reft
of it, viz. that the other favages would not purfue
him thither, and find him there. However, I kept
my ftation, and my fpirits began to recover, when I
found that there were not above three men that fol-
lowed him; and full more was I encouraged, when I found that he outilript them exceedingly in running,
and gained ground of them, fo that if he could but
hold it for half an hour, I faw eafily he would fairly
get away from them all.
There was between them and my castle the creek,
which I mentioned often at the first part of my ftory,
when I landed my cargoes out of the fhip; and this I
knew, he muft neceflarily fwim over, ,or the poor
wretch would be taken there: but when the favage
efcaping came thither, he made nothing of it, though
the tide was then up; but plunging in, fwam through
in about thirty ftrokes, or thereabouts, landed, and
ran on with exceeding ftrength and fwiftnefs; when
the three purfuers came to the creek, I found that two
of them could fwim, but the third could not, and
that he, landing on the other fide, looked at the
other, but went no farther; and foon after went
foftly back again, which, as it happened, was very
well for him in the main.
I obferved,
I obferved, that the two who fwam were yet more than twice as long fwimming over the creek than the1
fellow was that fled from them: it came now very
warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed irrefiftibly,
that now was my time to get a fervant, and perhaps
a companion,. or afliflant, and that I was called
plainly by Providence to fave this poor creature's life-i
I immediately got down the ladders with all poffible.
expedition, fetched my two guns, for they were
both at the foot of the ladder, as I obferved above;
and getting up again with the fame hafte to the top of
the hill, I crafted towards the fea; and having a
very fhort cut, and all down-hill, clapped myfelf in
the way between the purfuers and the purfued, hal-
looing aloud to him that fled, who, looking back,
was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me as at
them; but I beckoned with my hand to him to come
back; and in the mean time, I flo'.\ly advanced to-
wards the two that followed; then rushing at once
upon the foremost, I knocked him down with the
Rock of my piece; I was loth to fire, becaufe I would
not have the reft hear, though at that diftance it
would not have been eafily heard; and being out of
fight of the smoke too, they would not have eafily
known what to make of it. Having knocked this
fellow down, the other who purfued him flopped, as
if he had been frightened, and I advanced apace
towards him; but as I came nearer, I perceived pre-
fently he had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to
fhoot at me; fo I was then neceffitated to fhoot at
him firft; which I did, and killed him at the firft
fhot. The poor favage who fled, but had flopped,
though he faw both his enemies fallen, and killed
(as

(as he thought) yet was fo frighted with the fire and
noife of my piece, that he flood ftock-flill, and
neither came forward, nor went backward, though
he feemed rather inclined to fly still, than to come
on. I hallooed again to him, and made figns to
come forward, which he eafily understood, and came
a little way, then flopped again, and then a little
farther, and flopped again; and I could then perceive
that he stood trembling, as if he had been taken pri-
foner, and had just been to be killed, as his two
enemies were. I beckoned him again to come to me,
and gave him all the figns of encouragement that I
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token of
acknowledgment for faving his life. I smiled at him,
and looked pleafantly, and beckoned to him to come
ftill nearer. At length he came clofe to me, and
then he kneeled down again, kified the ground, and
laid his head upon the ground, and taking me by the
foot, fet my foot upon his head: This, it feems, was
in token of fwearing to be my Have for ever. I took
him up, and made much of him, and encouraged him
all I could. But there was more work to do yet;
for I perceived the favage, whom I knocked down,
was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and began
to come to himfelf: fo I pointed to him, and fhewed
him the favage, that he was not dead; upon this he
fpoke fome words to me; and though I could not
underfland them, yet I thought they were pleafant to
hear, for they were the first found of a man's voice
that I had heard, my own excepted, for above five-
and-twenty years: but there was no time for fuch
reflections now: the favage, who was knocked down,
VOL. I. S recovered
recovered himfelf fo far as to fit up upon the ground;
and I perceived that my favage began to be afraid;
but when I faw that, I prefented my other piece at the
man, as if I would fhoot him; upon this my favage,
for fo I call him now, made a motion to me to lend
him my fword, which hung naked in a belt by my
fide; fo I did: he no fooner had it, but he runs to
his enemy, and at one blow cut off his head fo cle-
verly, no executioner in Germany could have done
it fooner or better; which I thought it very ftrange
for one, who, I had reafon to believe, never faw a
fword in his life before, except their own wooden
fwords; however it feems, as I learned afterwards,
they make their wooden fwords fo fharp, fo heavy,
and the wood is fo hard, that they will cut off heads
even with them, nay, and arms, and that at one blow
too. When he had done this, he comes laughing
to me in fign of triumph, and brought me the fword
again, and, with abundance of geftures, which I did
not underftand, laid it down, with the head of the
favage that he had killed, juft before me.
But that which aflonifhed him moft was, to know
how I had killed the other Indian fo far off; fo point-
ing to him, he made figns to me to let him go to him:
fo I bade him go, as well as I could; when he came
to him, he stood like one amazed, looking at him;
turned him firft on one fide, then on t'other; looked
at the wound the bullet had made, which it feems
was juft in his breast, where it had made an hole,
and no great quantity of blood had followed; but he
had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead: then he
took up his bow and arrows, and came back; fo I
turned to go away, and beckoned him to follow
me,
me, making figns to him that more might come
after them, Upon this he figned to me, that he would bury
them with fand, that they might not be feen by the
roll, if they followed; and fo I made figns again to
him to do fo; he fell to work, and in an inftant he
had fcraped an hole in the fand with his hands, big
enough to bury the firft in, and then dragged him
into it, and covered him, and did fo alfo by the
other; I believe he had buried them both in a quar-
ter of an hour; then calling him away, I carried
him not to my caftle, but quite away to my cave, on
the farther part of the ifland; fo I did not let my
dream come to pafs in that part; viz. that he came
into my grove for fhelter.
Here I gave him bread, and a bunch of raifins to
eat, and a draught of water, which I found he was
indeed in great diftrefs for, by his running; and
having refrefhed him, I made figns for him to go lie
down and fleep, pointing to a place where I had laid
a great parcel of rice-ftraw, and a blanket upon it,
which I ufed to fleep upon myfelf fometimes; fo the
poor creature lay down, and went to fleep.
He was a comely handfome fellow, perfectly well
made, with ftraight long limbs, not too large, tall,
and well-fhaped, and, as I reckon, about twenty-fix
years of age. He had a very good countenance, not
a fierce and furly aspect, but feemed to have fome.
thing very manly in his face, and yet he had all the
fweetnefs and foftnefs of an European in his coun-
tenance too, efpecially when he smiled : his hair was
long and black, not curled like wool; his forehead
very high and large, and a great vivacity and
S 2 fparkling
fparkling fliarpnefs in his eyes. The colour of his
fkin was not quite black, but very tawny, and yet
not of an ugly yellow naufeous tawny, as the Bra-
filians and Virginians, and other natives of America
are, but of a bright kind of a dun olive colour, that
had in it fomething very agreeable, though not very
eafy to defcribe. His face was round and plump,
his nofe finally, not flat like the negroes, a very good
mouth, thin lips, and his teeth fine, well-fet, and
white as ivory: after he had slumbered, rather than
flept, about half an hour, he waked again, and comes
out of the cave to me, for I had been milking my
goats, which I had in the inclofure juft by: when
he efpied me, he came running to me, laying himfelf
down again upon the ground, with all the poffible
figns of an humble thankful difpofition, making many
antic gestures to fhew it. At raft he lays his head
flat upon the ground, clofe to my foot, and fets my
other foe - upon his head, as he had done before; and
after this, made all the figns to me of subjection, fervitude, and fubmiffion imaginable, to let me know
how much he would ferve me as long as he lived:
I underftood him in many things, and let him know
I was very well pleased with him; in a little time I
began to fpeak to him, and teach him to fpeak to
me; and first, I made him know his name would be
Friday, which was the day I faved his life; and I
called him fo for the memory of the time; I likewife
taught him to fay mafter, and then let him know that
was to be my name; I likewife taught him to fay
Yes and No, and to know the meaning of them; I
gave him fome milk in an earthen pot, and let him
fee me drink it before him, and fop my bread in it;
and
and I gave him a cake of bread to do the like, which
he quickly domplied with, and made figns that it
was very good for him.
I kept there with him all that night; but as foon as
it was day, I beckoned him to come with me, and
let him know I would give him fotne clothes; at which
he feemed very glad, for he was ftark-naked. As
we went by the place where he had buried the two
men, he pointed exactly to the fpot, and fhewed me
the marks that he had made to find them again, mak-
ing figns to me that we would dig them up again,
and eat them; at this I appeared very angry, expressed my abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at the
thoughts of it, and beckoned with my hand to him
to come away, which he did immediately, with great
fubmiffion: I then led him up to the top of the hill,
to fee if his enemies were gone, and pulling out my
glafs, I looked, and faw plainly the place where they
had been, but no appearance of them, or of their
canoes; fo that it was plain that they were gone, and
had left their two comrades behind them, without any
fearch after them.
But I was not content with this difcovery; but
having now more courage, and consequently more
curiofity, I took my man Friday with me, giving him
the fword in his hand, with the bow and arrows at
his back, which I found he could ufe very dexte-
roufly, making him carry one gun for me, and I two
for myfelf, and away we marched to the place where
thefe creatures had been; for I had a mind now to
get fome fuller intelligence of them: when I came to
the place, my very blood ran chill in my veins, and
my heart funk within me at the horrcr of the spectacle :
S 3 indeed
indeed it was a dreadful fight, at leaft it was fo to me,
though Friday made nothing of it: the place was
covered with human bones, the ground dyed with
the blood, great pieces of flour left here and there,
half-eaten, mangled, and fcorched; and, in fhort,
all the tokens of the triumphant feast they had been
making there, after a victory over their enemies: I
faw three fkulls, five hands, and the bones of three
or four legs and feet, and abundance of other parts
of the bodies ; and Friday, by his figns, made me
understand that they brought over four prifoners to
feaft upon; that three of them were eaten up, and
that he, pointing to himfelf, was the fourth; that
there had been a great battle between them and their
next king, whofe fubjects, it feams, he had been one
of; and that they had taken a great number of pri-
foners, all which were carried to feveral places by
thofe that had taken them in the flight, in order to
feast upon them, as was done here by thefe wretches
upon thofe they brought hither.
I caufed Friday to gather all the fkulls, bones, flesh, and whatever remained, and lay them together on
an heap, and make a great fire upon it, and burn
them all to James : I found Friday had ftill an hanker-
ing ftomach after fome of the flefh, and was ftill a
canibal in his nature; but I difcovered fo much ab-
horrence at the very thoughts of it, and at the leaft
appearance of it, that he durft not difcover it; for I
had, by fome means, let him know, that I would
kill him if he offered it.
When we had done this, we came back to our
caftle, and there I fell to work for my man Friday;
and first of all, I gave him a pair of linen drawers,
which
which I had out of the poor gunner's cheft I men-
tioned, and which I found in the wreck; and
which, with a little alteration, fitted him very
well; then I made him a jerkin of goat's skin as
well as my fkill would allow, and I was now grown
a tolerable good taylor ; and I gave him a cap, which
I had made of an hare fkin, very convenient, and
fafhipnable enough: and thus he was dreffed, for
the prefent, tolerably well, and mighty well was he
pleafed to fee himfelf almost as well clothed as his mas- ter: it is true, he went awkwardly in thefe things at
first ; wearing the drawers was very awkward to him,
and the fleeves of the waiftcoat galled his shoulders and the inside of his arms; but a little eafing them,
where he complained they hurt him, and ufing him-
felf to them, at length he took to them very well.
The next day after I came home to my hutch with
him, I began to confider where I would lodge him;
and that I might do well for him, and yet be perfectly
eafy myfelf, I made a little tent for him in the vacant
place between my two fortifications, in the infide of
the raft, and in the outfide of the firft: and as there
was a door or entrance there into my cave, I made a
formal framed door-cafe, and a door to it of boards,
and fet it up in the package, a little within the entrance;
and causing the door to open on the infide, I barred
it up in the night, taking in my ladders too; fo that
Friday could no way come at me in the infide of my
innermoft wall, without making fo much noife in
getting over, that it muft needs awaken me; for my
first wall had now a complete roof over it of long
poles, covering all my tent, and leaning up to the
fide of the hill, which was again laid crofs with finall
S 4 flicks
fticks instead of laths, and then thatched over a great
thicknefs with the rice-ftraw, which was ftrong like
reeds; and at the hole or place which was left to go
in or out by the ladder, I had placed a kind of trap-
door, which if it had been attempted on the out-
fide, would not have opened at all, but would have
fallen down, and made a great noife; and as to wea-
pons, I took them all in to my fide every night.
But I needed none of all this precaution ; for never
man had a more faithful, loving, fincere fervant than
Friday was to me; without paffions, fullennefs, or
defigns; perfectly obliging and engaging; his very
affections were tied to me, like thofe of a child to a
father; and I dare fay, he would have facrificed his
life for the faving mine, upon any occafion whatfo-
ever: the many teftimonies he gave me of this put
it out of doubt; and foon convinced me, that I
needed to ufe no precautions as to my fafety on his
account.
This frequently gave me occafion to obferve, and
that with wonder, that, however it had pleafed GOD
in his providence, and in the government of the
works of his hands, to take from fo great a part of
the world of his creatures the bef t ufes to which
their faculties, and the powers of their fouls, are
adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them the
fame powers, the fame reason, the fame afie&ions,
the fame fentiments of kindnefs and obligation, the
fame paifions and refentments of wrongs, the fame
fenfe of gratitude, fincerity, fidelity, and all the
capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that
he has given to us; and that when he pleafes to offer
them occafions of exerting these, they are as ready,
nay,
nay, more ready to apply them to the right ufes for
•which they were beftowed, than we are. And this
made me very melancholy fometimes, in reflecting,
as the feveral occafions prefented, how mean an ufe
\ve make of all thefe, even though we have thefe
powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the fpirit of GOD, and by the knowledge of his word,
added to our underslanding; and why it has pleafed
GOD to hide the like faving knowledge from fo many
millions of fouls, who, if I might judge by this poor
favage, would make a much better ufe • of it than we
did.
From hence I fometimes was led too far to invade
the fovereignty of Providence; and, as it were,
arraign the juftice of fo arbitrary a difpcfition of
things, that should hide that light from fome, and
reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from
both: but I fhut it up, and checked my thoughts
with this conclufion: First, that we do not know by
what light and law thefe should be condemned; but
that as GOD was neceflarily, and by' the nature of
his being, infinitely holy and just, fo it could not be,
but that if thefe creatures were all fentenced to ab-
fence from himfelf, it was on account of firming against that light, which, as the Scripture fays, was
a law to themfelves, and by fuch rules as their con- -
fciences would acknowledge to be juft, though the
foundation was not difcovered to us: and, fecondly,
that ftill, as we are all clay in the hand of the potter,
no veflel could fay to him, Why haft thou formed
me thus?
But to return to my new companion: I was greatly
delighted with him, and made it my bufinfs to teach
him
him every thing that was proper to make him ufefuf,
handy, and helpful; but efpecially to make him
fpeak, and underftand me when I fpake: and he
was the apteft fcholar that ever was; and particu-
larly was fo merry, fo constantly diligent, and fo
pleafed when he could but underftand me, or make
me understand him, that it was very pleafant to me
to talk to him; and now my life began to be fo eafy,
that I began to fay to myfelf, that could I but have
been fafe from more favages, I cared not if I was
never to remove from the place while I lived.
After I had been two or three days returned to my
caftle, I thought that, in order to bring Friday off
from his horrid way of feeding, and from the relish of a canibal's ftomach, I ought to let him taste other
flesh ; fo I took him out with me one morning to the
woods: I went, indeed, intending to kill a kid out
of my own flock, and bring it home and drefs it r
but as I was going, I faw a fhe-goat lying down in
the fhade, and two young kids fitting by her: I
catched hold of Friday, Hold, faid I, ftand ftill; and
made figns to him not to ftir; immediately I pre-
fented my piece, fhot and killed one of the kids. The
poor creature, who had, at a diftance indeed, feen me
kill the favage his enemy, but did not know, or
could imagine how it was done, was fenfibly fur-
prifed, trembled and look, and looked fo amazed,
that I thought he would have funk down: he did not
fee the kid I had met at, or perceive I had killed it?
but ripped up his waistcoat to feel if he was not
wounded; and, as I found, prefently thought I was
refolved to kill him; for he came and kneeled down
to me, and, embracing my knees, faid a great many
things
things I did not underftand j but I could eafily fee
that his meaning was to pray me not to kill him.
I foon found a way to convince him, that I would
do him no harm; and taking him up by the hand,
laughed at him, and pointing to the kid" which I had
killed, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he
did; and while he was wondering and looking to fee
how the creature was killed, I loaded my gun again,
and by and bye I faw a great fowl, like an hawk, fit
upon a tree within mot; fo, to let Friday underftand
a little what I would do, I called him to me again,
pointing at the fowl, which was indeed a parrot,
though I thought it had been an hawk; I fay, point-
ing to the parrot, and to my gun, and to the ground
under the parrot, to let him fee I would make him
fall, I made him underftand that I would fhoot and
kill that bird; accordingly I fired, and bid him look,
and immediately he faw the parrot fall: he stood like one frighted again, notwithstanding all that
I had faid to him; and I found he was the more
amazed, becaufe he did not fee me put any thing
into the gun; but thought there muft be fome won-
derful fund of death and destruction in that thing,
able to kill man, beast, bird, or any thing near or
far off; for the aftonifhment this created in him
was fuch, as could not wear off for a long time; and
I believe, if I would have let him, he would have
worfhipped me and my gun: as for the gun itfelf, he
would not fo much as touch it for feveral days after;
but would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
fwered him, when he was by himfelf; which, as I
afterwards learned of him, was to defire it not to
kill him.
Well:
Well: after his aftonifhment was a little over at
this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the bird I had met, which he did, but ftaid fome time; for the
parrot, not being quite dead, had fluttered a good
way off from the place where me fell; however he
found her, took her up, and brought her to me;
and, as I had perceived his ignorance about the gun
before, I took this advantage to charge the gun again,
and not let him fee me do it, that I might be ready
for any other mark that might prefent; but nothing
more offered at that time; fo I brought home the
kid; and the fame evening I took the fkin off, and
.cut it out as well as I could, and having a pot for
that purpofe, I boiled or ftewed fome of the flefh,
and made fome very good broth; after I had be-
gun to eat fome, I gave fome to my man, who
feemed very glad of it, and liked it very well; but
that which was strangest to him, was, to fee me eat
fait with it. He made a feign to me that the fait
was not good to eat; and putting a little into his own
mouth, he feemed to naufeate it, and would fpit and
fputter at it, warning his mouth with fresh water
after it; on the other hand, I took fome meat in my
mcuth without fait, and I pretended to fpit and fput-
ter for want of fair, as fair as he had done at the fait;
but it would not do, he would never care for fait
with meat, or in his broth; at least, not a great
while, and then but a very little.
Having thus fed him with boiled meat and broth,
I was refolvcd to feast him the next day with roafting
a piece of the kid: this I did by hanging it before
the fire in a firing, as I had feen many people do in
England, fetting two poles up, one on each fide the
fire,
fire, and one crofs on the top, and tying the firing
to the crofs flick, letting the meat turn continually:
this Friday admired very much; but when he came to
tafte the flefh, he took fo many ways to tell me how
well he liked it, that I could not but understand him; and at laft he told me he would never eat man's
flesh any more, which I was very glad to hear.
The next day I fet him to work to beating fome
corn out, and fifting it in the manner I ufed to do, as
I obferved before; and he foon underftood how to do
it as well tis I, efpecially after he had feen what the
meaning of it was, and that it was to make bread of;
for after that I let him fee me make my bread, and
bake it too; and in a little time Friday was able to
do all the work for me, as well as I could do it
myfelf. o' I began now to confider, that having two mouths
to feed inftead of one, I must provide more ground
for my harveft, and plant a larger quantity of corn,
than I ufed to do; fo I marked out a larger piece of
land, and began the fence in the fame manner as be-
fore, in which Friday not only worked very willingly,
and very hard, but did it very cheerfully; and I told
him what it was for, that it was for corn to make
more bread, becaufe he was now with me, and that I
might have enough for him and myfelf too: he ap-
peared very fenfible of that part, and let me know,
that he thought I had much more labour upon me on
his account, than I had for myfelf, and that he
would work the harder for me, if I would tell him
what to do.
This was the pleafanteft year of all the life I led in
this place: Friday began to talk pretty well, and
underftand
understand the names of almost every thing I had
occafion to call for, and of every place I had to fend
him to, and talk a great deal to me; fo that, in
fhort, I began now to have fome ufe for my tongue
again, which indeed I had very little occafion for be-
fore; that is to fay, about fpeech: befides the plea-
fure of talking to him, I had a singular fatisfaction in
the fellow himself ; his fimple unfeigned honefty ap-
peared to me more and more every day, and I began
really to love the creature; and on his fide, I believe
he loved me more than it is was poffible for him ever
to love any thing before.
I had a mind once to try if he had any hankering
inclination to his own country again; and having
learned him Englishfo well, that he could anfwer me
almoft any queftions, I asked him, whether the na-
tion that he belonged to never conquered in battle?
At which he smiled, and faid, Yes, yes, we always
fight the better; that is, he meant, always get the
better in fight; and fo we began the following dif-
courfe. You always fight the better! faid I: How
come you to be taken prifoner'then, Friday?
Friday. My nation beat much for all that.
Mafter. How beat; if your nation beat them,
how came you to be taken?
Friday. They more than my nation in the place
where me was; they take one, two, three, and me:
My nation over-beat them in the yonder place, where
me no was; there my nation take one, two great
thoufand.
Mailer,But why did not your fide recover you
from the hands of your enemies then?
FridayFriday. They run one, two, three, and me, and
make go in the canoe; my nation have no canoe
that time.
Majicr. Well, Friday, and what does your nation
do with the men they take? Do they carry them
away, and eat them as thefe did \
Friday. Yes, my nation eat mans too, eat all up.
Mafter. Where do they carry them?
Friday. Go to other place where they think.
Mafter. Do they come hither?
Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither; come other
else place.
Miter,Have you been here with them?
Friday. Yes, I been here [points to the N. W.
fide of the ifland, which, it feems, was their fide]].
By this I underftood, that my man Friday had
formerly been among the favages, who ufed to come
on more on the farther part of the ifland, on the faid
man-eating occafions that he was now brought for;
and fome time after, when I took the courage to carry
him to that fide, being the fame I formerly men-
tioned, he prefently knew the place, and told me, he
was there once when they eat up twenty men, two
women, and one child: he could not tell twenty in
English,but he numbered them by laying fo many
ftones in a row, and pointing to me to tell them over.
I^have told this passage, becaufe it introduces
what follows; that after I had had this difcourfe
with him, I afked him, How far it was from our
ifland to the more, and whether the canoes were not
often loft? He told me there was no danger, no
canoes ever loft; but that after a little way out to
fea,
fea, there was a current, and a wind always one way
in the morning, the other in the afternoon.
This I underftand to be no more than the fets of
the tide, as going out, or coming in; but I aft '-
wards underftood it was occasioned by the great
draught and reflux of the mighty river Oroonoque;
in the mouth of which river, as I thought afterwards,
our ifland lay; and that this land, which I perceived
to the W. and N. W. was the great ifland 'Trinidad,
on the north point of the mouth of the river: I afked
Friday a thoufand queftions about the country, the
inhabitants, the fea, the coast, and what nations
were near; he told me all he knew with the greatest opennefs imaginable; I afked him the names of the
feveral nations of his fort of people, but could get no
other name than Caribs; from whence I eanly under-
ftood, that thefe were the Caribees, which our maps
place on that part of America which reaches from the
mouth of the river Oroonoque to Guinea, and onwards
to St. Martha: he told me, that up a great way be-
yond the moon, that was, beyond the fetting of the
moon, which muft be W. from their country, there
dwelt white bearded men, like me, and pointed to
my great whifkers, which I mentioned before; and
that they had killed much mans, that was his word '.
by which I underftood he meant the Spaniards, where cruelties in America had been fpread over the whole
countries, and were remembered by ail the nations
from father to fon.
I enquired if he could tell me how I might come
from this ifland, and get among thofe white men;
he told me, Yes, yes, I might go in two canoe; I
could
Could not underftand what he meant by two canoe;
till at laft, with great difficulty, I found he meant,
that it muft be in a large great boat as big as two
canoes.
This part of Friday's difcourfe began to relish with
me very well; and from this time I entertained fome
hopes, that one time or other I might find an opportu-
nity to make my efcape from this place, and that this
poor favage might be a means to help me to do it.
During the long time that Friday had now been
with me, and that he began to fpeak to me, and un-
derftand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation
of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly, I
asked him one time, Who made him ? The poor crea-
ture did not underftand me at all, but thought I had
asked who was his father: but I took it by another
handle, and asked him, Who made the fea, the ground
he walked on, and the hills and woods? He told
me, it was one old Benamuckee that lived beyond all:
he could defcribe nothing of this great perfon, but
that he was very old; much older, he faid, than the
fea or the land, than the moon or the ftars. I afked
him then, if this old perfon had made all things, why
did not all things worfhip him ? He looked very grave,
and with a perfect look of innocence faid, all things
faid O! to him: I afked him, if the people who die
in his country, went away any-where ? He faid, Yes,
they all went to Benamuckee. Then I afked him, whe-
ther thofe they eat up went thither too ? he faid, Yes.
From thefe things I began to inftmct: him in the
knowledge of the true GOD. I told him, that the
great Maker of all things lived there, pointing up to-
wards heaven: that he governs the world by the lame
VOL. I. - T power
power and providence by which he made it; that he
was omnipotent, could do every thing for us, give
every thing to us, take every thing from us; and
thus, by degrees, I opened his eyes. He liftened
with great attention, and received with pleafure the
notion of JESUS CHRIST being fent to redeem us, and
of the manner of making our prayers to GOD, and
his being able to hear us, even into heaven: he told
me one day, that if our GOD could hear us up be-
yond the fun, he muft needs be a greater GOD than
their Benamuckee, who lived but a little way off, and
yet could not hear, till they went up to the great
mountains, where he dwelt, to fpeak to him. I
asked him, If ever he went thither to fpeak to him?
He faid, No, they never went that were young men;
none went thither but the old men; whom he called
their Oowookakee, that is, as I made him explain it
to me, their religious, or clergy; and that they went
to fay O ! (fo he called faying prayer&) and then came
back, and told them what Benamuckee faid: by this
I obferved, that there is prieftcraft even amongft the
moft blinded ignorant Pagans in the world; and the
policy of making a fecret religion, in order to pre-
ferve the veneration of the people to the clergy, is not
only to be found in the Roman, but perhaps among
all religions in the world, even among the moft. bru-
tifh and barbarous favages.
I endeavoured to clear up this fraud to my man
Friday; and told him, that the pretence of their old
men going up to the mountains to fay O! to their god
Benamuckee, was a cheat; and their bringing word
from thence what he faid, was much more fo; that
if they met with any anfwer, or fpoke with any one
there,
there, it must be with an evil fpirit: and then I en-
tered into a long difcourfe with him about the devil,
the original of him, his rebellion againft GOD, his
enmity to man, the reafon of it, his fetting himfelf
up in the dark parts of the world to be worshipped
instead of GOD, and as GOD, and the many strata- gems he made ufe of, to delude mankind to their
ruin; how he had a fecret accefs to our paffions, and
to our affections, to adapt his snares fo to our inclina-
tions, as to caufe us even to be our own tempters, and
to run upon our own destruction by our own choice.
I found it was not fo eafy to imprint right notions
in his mind about the devil, as it was about the being
of a GOD: nature aflifted all my arguments to evi-
dence to him even the necessity of a great firft cause, and over-ruling governing power, a fecret directing Providence, and of the equity and justice of paying
homage to him that made us, and the like: but there
appeared nothing of all this in the notion of an evil
fpirit, of his original, his being, his nature, and
above all, of his inclination to do evil, and to draw
us in to do fo too: and the poor creature puzzled me
once in fuch a manner, by a question merely natural
and innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to him.
I had been talking a great deal to him of the power of
GOD, his omnipotence, his dreadful averfion to fin,
his being a confuming fire to the workers of iniquity;
how, as he had made us all, he could deftroy us,
and all the world, in a moment; and he liftened
with great ferioufnefs to me all the while.
After this, I had been telling him how the devil
was GOD'S enemy in the hearts of men, and ufed all
his malice and fkill to defeat the good defigns of Pro-
T 2 vidence,
vidence, and to ruin the kingdom of CHRIST in the
world, and the like: Well, fays Friday, but you
fay GOD is fo ftrong, fo great, is he not much
ftrong, much might, as the devil? Yes, yes, faid
I, Friday, GOD is stronger than the devil, GOD is
above the devil, and therefore we pray to GOD to
tread him under our feet, and enable us to refift his
temptations, and quench his fiery darts. But, fays
he again, if GOD much ftrong, much might, as the
devil, why GOD not kill the devil, fo make him no
more wicked?
I was ftrangely furprifed at his question ; and after
all, though I was now an old man, yet I was but a
young doctor, and ill enough qualified for a cafuift,
or a folver of difficulties: and, at first, I could not
tell what to fay; fo I pretended not to hear him, and
afked him what he faid? but he was too earnest for
an anfwer to forget his queftion; fo that he repeated
it in the very fame broken words, as above. By this
time I had recovered myfelf a little, and I faid, GOD
will at laft punifh him feverely; he is referved for the
judgment, and is to be cal into the bottomlefs pit,
to dwell with everlafting fire: this did not fatisfy
Friday; but he returns uporime, repeating my words,
Referve at laft ! me no understand : but why not kill
the devil now, not kill great ago? You may as well
afk me, faid I, why GOD does not kill you and me,
when we do wicked things here that offend him: we
are preferved to repent and be pardoned. He mufes
a while at this; Well, well, fays he, mighty affec-
tionately, that well; fo you, I, devil, all wicked, all
preferve, repent, GOD pardon all. Here I was run
down again by him to the laft degree, and it was a
teftimony
\
testimony to me, how the mere notions of nature,
though they will guide reafonable creatures to the
knowledge of a GOD, and of a worfhip or homage
due to the fupreme being of GOD, as the confequence
of our nature; yet nothing but divine revelation can
form the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, and of a re-
demption purchafed for us; of a Mediator; of a new
covenant; and of an Intercessor at the footftool of
GOD'S throne; I fay, nothing but a revelation from
Heaven can form thefe in the foul; and that there-
fore the Gofpel of our Lord and Saviour JESUS
CHRIST, I mean the word of GOD, and the Spirit of
GOD, promifed for the guide and fanctiner of his
people, are the abfolutely neceffary inftru&ors of the
fouls of men in the faving knowledge of GOD, and the
means of falvation,
I therefore diverted the prefent difcourfe between
me and my man, rising up haftily, as upon fome
fudden occafion of going out; then fending him for
fomething a great way,off, I ferioufly prayed to GOD,
that he would enable me to inftrucl: favingly this poor
favage, affifting, by his Spirit, the heart of the poor
ignorant creature to receive the light of the knowledge
of GOD in CHRIST, reconciling him to himfelf, and
would guide me to fpeak fo to him from the word of
GOD, as his confcience might be convinced, his eyes
opened, and his foul faved: when he came again to
me, I entered into a long difcourfe with him upon
the subject of the redemption of man by the Saviour
of the world, and of the doctrine of the gofpel
preached from Heaven, viz. of the repentance towards
GOD, and faith in our bleffed LORD JESUS: I then
T 3 explained
explained to him, as well as I could, why our blefled
Redeemer took not on him the nature of angels, but
the feed of Abraham, and how, for that reafon, the
fallen angels had no fhare in the redemption; that he
came only to the loft fheep of the houfe of Ifrael, and
the like.
I had, GOD knows, more fincerity than knowledge,
in all the methods I took for this poor creature's in-
ftruction; and muft acknowledge, what I believe all
that act upon the fame principle will find, that in lay-
ing things open to him, I really informed and in-
ftructed myfelf in many things that either I did not
know, or had not fully considered before; but which
occurred naturally to my mind, upon my fearching
into them for the information of this poor favage;
and I had more affection in my enquiry after things
upon this occafion, than ever I felt before; fo that
whether this poor wild wretch was the better for me
or no, I had great reafon to be thankful that ever he
came to me: my grief fat lighter upon me, my ha-
bitation grew comfortable to me beyond meafure;
and when I reflected, that in this folitary life, which I
had been confined to, I had not only been moved my-
felf to look up to Heaven, and to feek to the hand
that brought me thither, but was now to be made an
instrument, under Providence, to fave the life, and
for aught I know the foul of a poor favage, and
bring him to the true knowledge of religion, and of
the Christian doctrine, that he might know CHRIST
JESUS, to know whom is life eternal; I fay, when I
reflected upon all thefe things, a fecret joy ran through
every part of my foul, and I frequently rejoiced
that
that ever I was brought to this place, which I had
often thought the moft dreadful of all afflictions that
could poffibly have befallen me.
In this thankful frame I continued all the remainder
of my time, and the converfation which employed the
hours between Friday and me was fuch, as made the
three years which we lived there together perfectly
and completely happy, if any fuch thing as complete
happinefs can be found in a fublunary ftate: the fa-
vage was now a good Christian, a much better than
I; though I have reafon to hope, and blefs GOD for
it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted re-
ftored penitents: we had here the Word of GOD to
read, and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than
if we had been in England.
I always applied myfelf to reading the Scripture, and
to let him know, as well as I could, the meaning of
what I read; and he again, by his ferocious enquiries
and queflions, made me, as I faid before, a much
betterfcholar in the Scripture knowledge, than I should ever have been by my own private reading: another
thing I cannot refrain from obferving here alfo from
experience, in this retired part of my life; viz. how
infinite and inexpreffible a bleffing it is, that the
knowledge of GOD, and of the doctrine of falvation
by CHRIST JESUS, is fo plainly laid down in the
Word of GOD, fo eafy to be received and underftood,
that as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable
of underflanding enough of my duty to carry me di-
rectly on to the great work of fincere repentance for
my fins, and laying hold of a Saviour for life and
falvation, to a Rated reformation in practice, and
obedience to all God's commands, and this without
T 4 any
any teacher or instructor (I mean, human) fo the plain instruction fufficiently ferved to the enlightening
this favage creature, and bringing him to be fuch
a Chriftian, as I have known few equal to him in my life.
As to the difputes, wranglings, ftrife, and conten,
tion, which has happened in the world about religion,
whether niceties in doctrines, or fchemes of church
government, they were all perfectly ufelefs to us, as, for aught I can yet fee, they have been to all the reds in the world: we had the fure guide to heaven, viz,
the Word of GOD; and we had, blefled be GOD!
comfortable views of the Spirit of GOD, teaching and
instructing us by his Word, leading us into all truth,
and making us both willing and obedient to the in ftruction of his word; and I cannot fee the leaft ufe
that the greatest knowledge of the difputed points in
religion, which have made fuch confusions in the
world, would have been to us, if we could have ob-
tained it: but I muft go on with the hiftorical part
of things, and take every part in its order.
After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could underftand almoft all I
faid to him, and fpeak fluently, though in broken
English,to me, I acquainted him with myownftory,
or at leaft fo much of it as related to my coming into
the place, how I had lived there, and how long: I
let him into the mystery (for fuch it was to him) of
gunpowder and bullets, and taught him how to meet :
I gave him a knife, which he was wonderfully de-
lighted with; and I made him a belt with a frog
hanging to it, fuch as in England we wear hangers in;
and in the frog, inftead of an hanger, I gave him
an
an hatchet, which was not only as good a weapon
in feme cafes, but much more ufeful upon many
occafions.
I defcribed to him the countries of Europe, and
particularly England, which I came from; how we
lived, how we worfhipped GOD, how we behaved to
one another, and how we traded in lips to all the
parts of the world: I gave him an account of the
wreck which I had been on board of, and mewed
him, as near as I could, the place where fhe lay; but
fhe was all beaten in pieces long before, and quite
gone.
I mewed him the ruins of our boat, which we loft
when we efcaped, and which I could not ftir with my
whole ftrength then; but was now fallen almoft all to
pieces: upon feeing this boat, Friday stood musing a
great while, and faid nothing; I afked him what it
was he ftudied upon? At laft, fays he, Me fee fuch
boat like come to place at my nation.
I did not understand him a go.od while; but at laft,
when I had examined further into it, I understood by
him, that a boat, fuch as that had been, came on
more upon the country where he lived; that is, as
he explained it, was driven thither by ftrefs of wea-
ther: I prefently imagined, that fome European fhip
muft have been caft away upon their coaft, and the
boat might get loofe, and drive afhore; but was fo
dull, that I never once thought of men making
escape from a wreck thither, much lefs whence they
might come; fo I only enquired after a defcription of
the boat.
Friday defcribed the boat to me well enough; but
brought me better to understand him, when he added,
with
with fome warmth, We fave the white mans from
drown: then I prefently afked him, if there were any
white mans, as he called them, in the boat? Yes, he
faid, the boat full of white mans: I asked him, how
many? he told upon his fingers feventeen: I afked
him then, what became of them? he told me, They
live, they dwell at my nation.
This put new thoughts into my head again; for I
prefently imagined, that thefe might be the men be-
longing to the lip that was caft away in fight of my
ifland, as I now call it; and who, after the fhip was
ftruck on the rock, and they faw her inevitably
loft, had faved themfelves in their boat, and
were landed upon that wild more among the fa*
vages.
Upon this I enquired of him more critically, what
was become of them? He affured me they lived flill
there, that they had been there about four years, that
the favages let them alone, and gave them victuals to
live. I asked him, how it came to pafs they did not
kill them, and eat them? he faid, No, they make
brother with them: that is, as I understood him, a
truce: and then he added, They eat no mans but
when make the war fight: that is to fay, they never
eat any men, but fuch as come to fight with them, and are taken in battle.
It was after this, fome confiderable time, that being
on the top of the hill, at the eaft fide of the island, from whence, as I have faid, I had in a clear day
discovered the main or continent of America; Friday,
the weather being very ferene, looks very earneftly
towai ds the main land, and in a kind of furprize falls
a jumping and dancing, and calls our to me, for I was
at
at fome difiance from him: I asked him what was the
matter? O joy! fays he, O glad! there fee my
country, there my nation!
I obferved an extraordinary fenfe of pleafure ap-
peared in his face, and his eyes fparkled, and his
countenance difcovered a ftrange eagernefs, as if he
had a mind to be.in his own country again; and this
obfervation of mine put a great many thoughts into
me; which made me at first not fo eafy about my
new man Friday as I was before; and I made no
doubt, but that if Friday could get back to his own
nation again, he would not only forget all his reli-
gion, but all his obligations to me; and would be
forward enough to give his countrymen an account
of me, and come back, perhaps, with an hundred or
two of them, and make a feaft upon me, at which he
might be as merry as he ufed to be with thofe of his
enemies, when they were taken in war.
But I wronged the poor honest creature very much,
for which I was very forry afterwards: however, as
my jealoufy increafed, and held me fome weeks, I was
a little more circumspect, and not fo familiar and
kind to him as before; in which I was certainly in
the wrong too, the honeft grateful creature having
no thought about it, but what confifted of the belt principles, both as a religious Chriftian, and as a
grateful friend, as appeared afterwards to my full
fatisfaction.
While my jealoufy of him lasted, you may be fure
. I was every day pumping him, to fee if he would dif-
cover any of the new thoughts which I fufpected
were in him; but I found every thing he faid was fo
honest, and fo innocent, that I could find nothing to
nouriih
nourifh my fufpicion; and, in fpite of all my uni
easiness, he made me at laft entirely his own again;
nor did he in the leaft perceive that I was uneafy -
and therefore I could not suspect him of deceit.
One day, walking up the fame hill, but the wea-
ther being hazy at fea, fo that we could not fee the
continent, I called to him, and faid, Friday, do not
you wish yourself in your own country, your own
nation? Yes, he faid, I be much O glad to be at my
own nation. What would you do there? faid I:
would you turn wild again, eat men's flour again, and
be a favage as you were before? He looked full of
concern, and fhaking his head, faid, No, no, Friday
tell them to live good, tell them to pray GOD, tell
them to eat corn-bread, cattle-flefh, milk, no eat man
again. Why then, faid I to him, they will kill you.
He looked grave at that, and then faid, No, they no
kill me, they willing love, learn: he meant by this,
they would be willing to learn. He added, they
learned much of the bearded mans that came in the
boat. Then I afkedhim, if he would go back to them?
He finiled at that, and told me he could not fwim to far. I told him I would make a canoe for him. He
told me he would go, if I would go with him. I go I
faid I, why they will eat me if I come there. No, no,
fays he, me make them no cat you, me make they
much love. you: he meant he would tell them how I
had killed his enemies and faved his life, and fo he
would make them love me. Then he told me, as well
as he could, how kind they were to feventeen white
men, or bearded men, as he called them, who came
on more in diftrefs.
From
From this time, I confefs, I had a mind to ven-
ture over, and fee if I could possibly join with thefe
bearded men, who, I made no doubt, were Spaniards
or Portuguese; not doubting but, if I could, we might
find fome method to efcape from thence, being upon
the continent, and a good company together, better
than I could from an ifland forty miles off the more,
and alone without help. So, after fome days, I took
Friday to work again, by way of difcourfe; and
told him, I would give him a boat to go back to
his own nation j and accordingly I carried him to
my frigate, which lay on the other fide of the island; and having cleared it of water (for I always kept it
funk in the water), I brought it out, fhewed it him,
and we both went into it.
I found he was a moft dexterous fellow at managing
it, would make it go almost as fwift and faft again as I
could; fo when he was in, I faid to him, Well, now
Friday, shall we go to your nation? He looked very
dull at my faying fo, which, it feems, was becaufe he
thought the boat too finally to go fo far. I told him
then I had a bigger; fo the next day I went to the
place where the firft boat lay which I had made, but
which I could not get into the water; he faid that
was big enough; but then, as I had taken no care
of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty years
there, the fun had fplit and dryed it, that it was in a manner rotten. Friday told me, fuch a boat
would do very well, and would carry 'much
* enough vittle, drink, bread,' that was his way of
talking.
Upon the whole, I was by this time fo fixed upon
my defign of going over with with him to the con-
tinent,
tinent, that I told him we would go and make one
as big as that, and he would go home in it. He
anfwered not one word, but looked very grave and
fad. I asked him,what was the matter with him?
He asked me again thus, Why you angry mad with
Friday? what me done? 1 afked him, what he meant?
I told him I was not angry with him at all: no angryJ
no angry! fays he, repeating the words feveral times,
Why fend Friday home away- to .my nation? Why,
faid I, Friday, did you not fay you wished you were
there? Yes, yes, fays he, with be both there; nowish Friday there, no mafter there. In a word, he would not think of going there without me. I go
there, Friday! faid I, what fhould I do there? He
turned very quick upon me at this; You do great
deal much good, fays -he, you teach wild mans be
good, fober, tame mans; you tell them know GOD,
pray GOD, and live new life. Alas, Friday, faid I,
thou knoweft not what thou fayeft; I am but an ig-
norant man myfelf. Yes, yes, fays he, you teechee
me good, you teechee them good. No, nc, Friday,
faid I, you fhall go without me; leave me here to
live by myfelf, as I did before. He looked confufed
again at that word, and running to one of the hat-
chets which he ufed to wear, he takes it up haftily,
and gives it me. What must I do with this? faid I
to him: you take kill Friday, fays he. What muft I
kill you for? faid I again. He returns very quick,
What you fend Friday away for? Take kill Friday,
no fend Friday away. This he fpoke fo earnestly, that I faw tears ftand in his eyes. In a word, I fo
plainly difcovered the utmoft affection in him to me,
and a firm refolution in him, that I told him then,
and
TT'F riW YC3*
I y VB^ARY 1
and often after, that I would never fend him away
from me, if he was willing to stay with me.
Upon the whole, as I found by all his difcourfe a
fettled affection to me, and that nothing should part
him from me, fo I found all the foundation of his
defire to go to his own country was laid in. his ar-
dent affection to the people, and his hopes of my do-
ing them good; a thing, which as I had no notion
of myfelf, fo I had not the leaft thought, or intention,
or defire of undertaking it: but ftill I found a ftrong
inclination to my attempting an efcape, as above,
founded on the fuppofition gathered from the former
difcourfe; viz. that there were feventeen bearded
men there; and therefore, without any delay, I went
to work with Friday, to find out a great tree proper
to fell, and make a large periagua or canoe, to under-
take the voyage: there were trees enough in the
ifland to have built a little fleet, not of periaguas and
canoes only, but even of good large vessels : but the
main thing I looked at, was to get one fo near the
water, that we might launch it when it was made,
to avoid the miftake I committed at fire. At laft Friday pitched upon a tree; for I found he
knew much better than I what kind of wood was
fittest for it; nor can I tell to this day what wood to
call the tree we cut down, except that it was very
like the tree we call fuftick, or between that and the
Nicaragua wood, for it was much of the fame colour
and fmell: Friday was for burning the hollow or ca-
vity of this tree out, to make it into a boat: but I
fhewed him how rather to cut it out with tools, which
after I mewed him how to ufe, he did very handily,
and in about a month's hard labour we finished it,
and
and made it very handfome, efpecially when, with our axes, which I fhewed him how to handle, we cut
and hewed the outfide into the true fhape of a boat;
after this, however, it coil us near a fortnight's time
to get her along, as it were inch by inch, upon great
rollers into the water: but when me « as in, fhe would
have carried twenty men with great eafe.
When me was in the water, and though fhe was fo
big, it amazed me to fee with what dexterity and
how fwift my man Friday could manage her, turn
her, and paddle her along; fo I afked him if he
would, and if we might venture over in her ? Yes,
he faid, he venture over in her very well, though
great blow wind: however, I had a farther defign
that he knew nothing of, and that was to make a
malt and fail, and to fit her with an anchor and ca-
ble: as to a malt, that was eafy enough to get; fo I
pitched upon aftrait young cedar-tree, which I found
near the place, and which there was a great plenty of
in the island ; and I fet Friday to work to cut it down,
and gave him directions how to shape and order it:
butasto the fail, that was my particular care ; I knew
I had old fails, or rather pieces of old fails enough;
but as I had them now twenty-fix years by me, and
had not been very careful to preferve them, not
imagining that I would ever have this kind of ufe for
them, I did not doubt but they were all rotten; and
indeed moft of them were fo; however, I found two
pieces which appeared pretty good, and with these I
went to work, and with a great deal of pains, and
awkward tedious ftitching (you may be fure) for
want of needles, I at length made a three-cornered
ugly thing, like what we call in England a shoulder- of-
bf-muttori fail, to go with a boom at bottom, and a
little fhort fprit at the top, fuch as ufually our fhips
long-boats fail with, and fuch as I beft knew how to
manage; becaufe it was fuch an one as I ufed in the
boat in which I made my efcape from Barbary, as re-
lated in the firft part of my story. I was near two months performing this laft work;
viz. rigging and fitting my malt and fails; for I
finifhed them very complete, making a fmall ftay,
and a fail or forefail to it, to affift, if we would turn to windward; and, which was more than all, I fixed
a rudder to the ftern of her, to fteer with; and
though I was but a bungling shipwright, yet as I
knew the ufefulnefs, and even neceffityof fuch a thing,
I applied myself with fo much pains to do it, that at
laft I brought it to pass, tho', confidering the many
dull contrivances I had for it that failed, I think it
coft me almost as much labour as making the boat.
After all this was done, I had my man Friday to
teach as to what belonged to the navigation of my
boat; for tho' he knew very well how to paddle the
canoe, he knew nothing what belonged to a fail and
a rudder, and was the more amazed when he faw me
work the boat to-and-again in the fea by the rudder,
and how the fail gybed, and filled this way or that
way, as the courfe we failed changed; I fay, when
he faw this, he stood like one astonished and amazed:
however, with a little ufe, I made all thefe things fa-
miliar to him, and he became an expert sailor, except
that as to the compafs I could make him underftand
very little of that: on the other hand, as there was very
little cloudy weather, and feldom or never any fogs
inthofe parts, there was the lefs occafion for a com-
VOL. I. U pafs,
L .
pafs, feeing the ftars were always to be feen by night,
and the fhore by day, except in the rainy feafons;
and then nobody cared to ftir abroad, either by land
or fea.
I was now entered on the feven-and-twentieth year
of my captivity in this place; though the three lafl
years that I had this creature with me, ought rather
to be left out of the account, my habitation being
quite of another kind than in all the reft of my time.
I kept the anniverfary of my landing here with the
fame thankfulnefs to GOD for his mercies as at firft;
and if I had fuch caufe of acknowledgment at first, I
had much more fo now, having fuch additional tef-
timonies of the care of Providence over me, and the
great hopes I had of being effectually and fpeedily
delivered; for I had an invincible impression upon
my thoughts, that my deliverance was at hand, and
that I would not be another year in this place: how-
ever, I went on with my husbandry, digging, plant-
ing, and fencing, as ufual; I gathered and cured
my grapes, and did every neceffary thing, as before.
The rainy feafon was in the mean time upon me, when I kept more within doors than at other times;
fo I had ftowed our new veffel as fecure as we could,
bringing her up into the creek, where, as I faid in
the beginning, I landed my rafts from the fhip; and
haling her up to the more, at high-water mark, I
made my man Friday dig a little dock, just big
enough for her to float in; and then, when the tide
was out, we made a ftrong dam crofs the end of it,
to keep the water out; and fo me lay dry, as to the
tide, from the fea; and to keep the rain off, we laid
a great many boughs of trees fo thick, that fiie was
as
as well thatched as an houfe; and thus we waited for
the months of November and December, in which I
designed to make my adventure.
When the fettled feafon began to come in, as the
thought of my design returned with the fair weather,
I was preparing daily for the voyage; and the first thing I did was to lay up a certain quantity of provi-
fion, being the lore for the voyage; and intended, in
a week or a fortnight's time, to open the dock, and
launch out our boat: I was bufy one morning upon
fomething of this kind, when I called to Friday, and
bid him go to the seashore, and fee if he could find
a turtle or tortoife, a thing which we generally got
once a week, for the fake of the eggs, as well as the
flefh. Friday had not been long gone, when he came
running back, and flew over my outward wall, or
fence, like one that felt not the ground, or the fteps
he fet his feet on; and before I had time to fpeak to
him, he cried out to me, O master ! O master ! O
foirow! O bad! What's the matter, Friday, faid I?
O yonder there, fays he, one, two, three, canoe!
one, two, three! By this way of fpeaking I con eluded there were fix; but on enquiry I found there
were but three. Well Friday, faid I, do not be
frighted; fo I heartened him up as well as I could.
However, I faw the poor fellow moft terribly feared;
for nothing ran in his head but that they were come
to look for him, and would cut him in pieces, and
eat him; the poor fellow trembled fo, that I fcarce
knew what to do with him: I comforted him as well
as I could, and told him I was in as much danger as
he, and that they would eat me as well as him : But,
faid I, Friday, we muft resolve to fight them: Can
U 2 vou
you fight, Friday? Me loot, fays he, but there
come many great number. No matter for that, faid
I again, our guns will fright them that we do not kill.
Sol afkedhim, whether, if I,refolvedtb defend him,
he would defend me, and stand by me, and do just as I bade him? He faid, Me die, when you bid die,
mafter; fo I went and fetched a good dram of rum, and gave him; for I had been fo good an hufband of
my rum, that I had a great deal left: when he had
drank it, I made him take the two fowling-pieces
which we always carried, and load them with large
fwan mot as big as fmall piftol-bullets; then I took
four mufquets, and loaded them with two flugs, and
five fmall bullets each; and my two piftols I loaded
with a brace of bullets each: I hung my great fword,
as ufual, naked by my fide, and gave Friday his
hatchet.
When I had thus prepared myfelf, I took my per-
fpective-glafs, and went up to the fide of the hill, to
fee what I could difcover; and I found quickly, by
my glafs, that there were one-and-twenty favages,
three prifoners, and three canoes; and that their
whole bufmefs feemed to be the triumphant banquet
upon thefe three human bodies; a barbarous feast indeed, but nothing more than as I had obferved was
ufual with them.
I obferved alfo, that they were landed, not where
they had done when Friday made his efcape, but
nearer to my creek, where the more was low, and
where a thick wood came clofe aloft down to the fea:
this, with the abhorrence of the inhuman errand
thefe wretches came about, fo filled me with indig-
nation, that I came down again to Friday', and told
him,
him, I was resolved to go down to them, and kill
them all; and afked him if he would Hand by me. He
was now gotten over his fright, and his fpirits being
a little raifed with the dram I had given him, he was
very cheerful; and told me, as before, he would
die when I bid die.
In this fit of fury, I took first and divided the
arms which I had charged, as before, between us:
I gave Friday one pistol to ftick in his girdle, and
three guns upon his shoulder ; and I took one piftol,
and the other three, myfelf; and in this pofture we
marched out; I took a fmall bottle of rum in my
pocket, and gave Friday a large bag with more pow-
der and bullet; and as to orders, I charged him to
keep clofe behind me, and not to stir, moot, or do
any thing till I bid him; and in the mean time, not
to fpeak a word: in this pofture I fetched a compafs
to my right hand of near a mile, as well to get over
the creek as to get into the wood; fo that I might
come within most of them before I could be difcovered,
which I had feen by my glafs it was eafy to do.
- While I was making this march, my former
thoughts returning, I began to abate my refolution -
I do not mean, that I entertained any fear of their
number; for as they were naked, unarmed wretches,
'tis certain I was fuperior to them; nay, though I had
been alone: but it occurred to my thoughts, what
call, what occasion, much lefs what necessity, I was
in to go and dip my hands in blood, to attack people
who had neither done or intended me any wrong, who,
as to me, were innocent, and whofe barbarous cuf-
toms were their own difafter, being in them a token indeed of GOD'S having left them, with the other
U 3 nations
nations of that part of the world, to fuch ftupidity
and to fuch inhuman courfes; but did not call me to
take upon me to be a judge of their actions, much
lefs an executioner of his justice ; that whenever he
thought fit, he would take the caufe into his own
hands, and by national vengeance punish them for
national crimes; but that in the mean time, it was
none of my business : that it was true, Friday might
juftify it, becaufe he was a declared enemy, and in a
ftate of war with thofe very particular people, and it
was lawful for him to attack them; but I could not
fay the fame with respect to me. Thefe things were
fo warmly preffed upon my thoughts all the way as I
went, that I refolved I would only go place myfelf
near them, that I might obferve their barbarous feast, and that I would act then as GOD mould direct; but
that unlefs fomething offered that was more a call to
me than yet I knew of, I would not meddle with
them.
With this refolution I entered the wood, and with
all possible warinefs and filence (Friday following
clofe at my heels) I marched till I came to the fkirt
of the wood, on the fide which was next to them;
only that one corner of the wood lay between me
and them: here I called foftly to Friday, and mew-
ing him :'. great tree, which was juft at the corner of
the wood, I bade him go to the tree, and bring me
word if he could fee there plainly what they were
doing: he did fo, and came immediately back to me,
and told me they might be plainly viewed there ; that
they were all about the fire, eating the flefhof one of
their prifoners; and that another lay bound upon
the fand, a little from them, whom he faid they would
kill
kill next, and which fired the very foul within me.
He told me, it was not one of their nation, but one
of the bearded men whom he had told me of, who
came to their country in the boat. I was filled with
horror at the very naming the white-bearded man,
and, going to the tree, I faw plainly, by my glafs,
a white man, who lay upon the beach of the fea,
with his hands and his feet tied with flags, or things
like rufhes; and that he was an European, and had
clothes on.
There was another tree, and a little thicket be-
yond it, about fifty yards nearer to them than the
place where I was, which, by going a little way
about, I faw I might come at undifcovered, and that
then I would be within half most of them; fo I with-
held my paffion, though I was indeed enraged to the
high eft degree; and going back about twenty paces,
I got behind fome bushes, which held all the way till
I came to the other tree, and then I came to a. little
riding ground, which gave me a full view of them, at
the diftance of about eighty yards.
I had now not a moment to lofe; for nineteen of
the dreadful wretches fat upon the ground all clofe
huddled together, and had just fent the other two to
butcher the' poor Christian, and bring^ him, perhaps
limb by limb, to their fire; and they were flopped down to untie the bands at his feet. I turned to Fri-
day; Now, Friday, faid I, do as I bid thee. Friday
faid, he would. Then, Friday, faid I, do exactly
as you fee me do; fail in nothing. So I fet down.
one of the mufquets and the fowling-piece upon the
ground, and Friday did the like by his; and with
the other mufquet I took my aim at the favages, bid-
U 4 ding
,
ding him do the like. Then afking him if he
ready, he faid, Yes. Then fire at them, faid I; and
the fame moment I fired alfo.
Friday took his aim fo much better than I, that on
the fide that he shot, he killed two of them, and
wounded three more; and on my fide, I killed one,
and wounded two. They were, you may be fure, in
a dreadful confirmation; and all of them, who were
not hurt, jumped up upon their feet immediately,
but did not know which way to run, or which way
to look; for they knew not from whence their de-
ftruction came. Friday kept his eyes clofe upon me,
that as I had bid him, hemight obferve what I did ; fq
as foon as the firft fhot was made, I threw down the
piece, and took up the fowling-piece, and Friday did
the like; he fees me cock, and prefent; he did the
fame again. Are you ready, Friday? faid I. Yes,
fays he. Let fly then, faid I, in the name of GOD;
and with that I fired again among the amazed wretches,
and fo did Friday; and as our pieces were now loaden
with what I called fwan-fhot, or fmall piftol bullets,
we found only two drop; but fo many were wounded,
that they ran about yelling and fcreaming like mad
creatures, all bloody, and miferably wounded moft
of them; whereof three more fell quickly after,
though not quite dead.
Now, Friday, faid I, laying down the difcharged
pieces, and taking up the mufquet, which was yet
loaden, follow me, faid I; which he did, with a
deal of courage; upon which I rufhed out of the
wood, and mewed myfelf, and Friday clofe at my foot:
as foon as I perceived they faw me, I fhouted as loud
as I could, and bade Friday do fo too; and running
as
as fail as I could, which by the way was not very faft,
being loaded with arms as I was, I made directly to-
wards the poor victim, who was, as I faid, lying
upon the beach, or more, between the place where
they fat and the fea; the two butchers, who were
just going to work with him, had left him, at the
surprise of our firft fire, and fled in a terrible fright
to the fea-fide, and had jumped irito a canoe, and
three more of the reft made the fame way: I turned
to Friday, and bade him ftep forwards, and fire at
them; he underftood me immediately, and running
about forty yards to be near them, he met at them,
and I thought he had killed them all; for I faw
them all fall on an heap into the boat; though I faw
two of them up again quickly: however, he killed
two of them, and wounded the third, fo that he lay
down in the bottom of the boat, as if he had been
dead.
While my man Friday fired at them, I pulled out
my knife, and cut the flags that bound the poor
victim; and loofmg his hands and feet I lifted him
up, and afked him in the Portuguesetongue, what
he was? He anfwered in Latin, Chriftianus; but
was fo weak and faint, that he could fcarce ftand, or
fpeak; I took my bottle out of my pocket, and gave
it him, making signs that he would drink, which he
did; and I gave him a piece of bread, which he eat;
then I afked him, what countryman he was? and he
faid, Efpagnole; and, being a little recovered, let
me know, by all the (signs he could possibly make,
how much he was in my debt for his deliverance:
Seignior, faid I, with as much Spanishas I could
make up, we will talk afterwards, but we must fight
now : if you have any strength left, take this piltol
and
298 LIFE AND ADVENTURES and fword, and lay about you : he took them very
thankfully, and no fooner had he the arms in his
hands, but as if they had put new vigour into him,
he flew upon his murderers like a fury, and had cut
two of them in pieces in an instant ; for the truth is,
as the whole was a furprife to them, fo the poor crea-
tures were fo much frighted with the noife of our
pieces, that they fell down for mere amazement and
fear, and had no more power to attempt their own
efcape, than their flesh had to refift our fhot; and
that was the cafe of thofe five that Friday met in the
boat; for as three of them fell with the hurt they re-
ceived, fo the other two fell ?. ith the fright.
I kept my piece in my hand still, without firing, being willing to keep my charge ready, becaufe I had
given the Spaniard my piftol and fword; fo I called
to Friday, and bade him run up to the tree from,
whence we firft fired, and fetch the arms which lay
there, that had been discharged, which he did with
great swiftness ; and then giving him my mufquet, I
fat down myfelf to load all the reft again, and bade
them come to me when they wanted: while I was
loading thefe pieces, there happened a fierce engage mcnt between the Spaniard and one of the favages,
who made at him with one of their great wooden
fwords, the fame weapon that was to have killed him
before, if I had not prevented it: the Spaniard, who
was as bold and as brave as could be imagined, tho' weak, had fought this Indian a good while, and had
cut him two great wounds on his head; but the
favage, being a ftout lufty fellow, clofing in with
him, had thrown him down (being faint), and was
wringing my fword out of his hand, when the Spa-
niard, though undermofl, wifely quitting his fword,
drew
drew the pistol from his girdle, fhot the favage
through the body, and killed him upon the fpot, be-
fore I, who was running to help, could come near
him.
Friday, being now left at his liberty, purfued the
flying wretches with no weapon in his hand but his
hatchet; and with that he difpatched thofe three,
who, as I faid before, were wounded at firft, and
fallen, and all the reft he could come up with 5 and
the Spaniard coming to me for a gun, I gave him one
of the fowling pieces, with which he purfued two of
thefavages, and wounded them both; but as he was
not able to run, they both got from him into the
wood, where Friday purfued them, and killed one of
them; but the other was too nimble for him; and
though he was wounded, yet he plunged into thefea,
and fwam with all his might off to thofe who were
left in the canoe, which three in the canoe, with one
wounded, who we know not whether he died or no,
were all that efcaped our hands of one-and-twenty.
The account of the reft is as follows:
3 Killed at our most from the tree.
2 Killed at the next lot. 2 Killed by Friday in the boat.
2 Killed by ditto, of thofe at first wounded.
'I Killed by ditto, in the wood.
3 Killed by the Spaniard.
4 Killed, being found dropt here and there of their
wounds, or killed by Friday in his chace of them.
4 Efcaped in the boat, whereof one wounded, if
not dead,
21 in all.
Thofe
Thofe that were in the canoe, worked hard to
get out of gunshot; and though Friday made two
or three shot at them, I did not find that he hit any
of them: Friday would fain have had me take one
of their canoes, and purfue them; and indeed I was
very anxious about their efcape, left carrying the
news home to their people, they would come back,
perhaps, with two or three hundred of their canoes,
and devour us by mere multitudes; fo I confented
to purfue them by fea; and running to one of their
canoes, I jumped in, and bade Friday follow me;
but when I was in the canoe, I was furprifed to find
another poor creature lie there alive, bound hand and
foot, as the Spaniard was, for the flaughter, and
almoft dead with fear, not knowing what the mat-
ter was; for he had not been able to look up over
the fide of the boat, he was tied fo hard, neck and
heels, and had been tied fo long, that he had really
little life in him,
I immedately cut the twifted flags, or rushes, which they had bound him with, and would have
helped him up; but he could not stand, or fpeak,
but groaned moft piteoufly, believing, it feems
full, that he was only unbound in order to be
killed.
When Friday came to him, I bade him fpeak to
him, and tell him of his deliverance; and pulling
out my bottle, made him give the poor wretch a
dram, which, with the news of his being delivered,
revived him, and he fat up in the boat; but when
Friday came to hear him fpeak, and looked in his
face, it would have moved any one to tears, to have
feen how Friday kissed him, embraced him, hugged
him, cried, laughed, hallooed, jumped about, danced,
fung,
•Jung, then cried again, wrung his hands, beat his
own face and head, and then fung and jumped about
again like a distracted creature. It was a good
while before I could make him fpeak to me, or tell
me what was the matter; but when he came a little to
himfelf, he told me that it was his father.
It was not eafy for me to exprefs how it moved me, to fee what extafy and filial affection had worked in
this poor favage, at the fight of his father, and of his
being delivered from death; nor indeed can I defcribe
half the extravagances of his affection after this; for
he went into the boat and out of the boat a great
many times: when he went in to him, he would fit
down by him, open his breast, and hold his father's
head clofe to his bofom, half an hour together, to
nourifh it: then he took his arms and ankles, which
were numbed and ftiff with the binding, and chafed
and rubbed them with his hands; and, I perceiving
what the cafe was, gave him fome rum out of my
bottle to rub them with, which did them a great deal
of good.
This action put an end to our purfuit of the canoe
with the other favages, who were now gotten almoft
out of fight; and it was happy for us that we did
not; for it blew fo hard within two hours after, and
before they could be gotten a quarter of their way,
and continued blowing fo hard all night, and that from
the north-weft, which was against them, that I could
not fuppofe their boat could live, or that they ever
reached to their own coaft.
But to return to Friday; he was fo bufy about his
father, that I could not find in my heart to take him
off for fome time: but after I thought he could leave
him a little, I called him to me, and he came jumping
and
and laughing, > and pleafed to the higheft extreme**
Then I asked him, if he had given his father any
bread? He fhook his head, and faid, None: ugly
dog eat all up self. So I gave him a cake of bread
out of a little pouch I carried on purpofe; I alfo gave
him a dram for himself, but he would not tafte it, but
carried it to his father: I had in my pocket alfo two
or three bunches of my raifins, fo I gave him a hand-
ful of them for his father. He had no fooner given
his father thefe raifins, but I faw him come out of the
boat, and run away as if he had been bewitched. He
ran at fuch a rate, (for he was the fwifteft fellow
of his feet that ever I faw) I fay, he ran at
fuch a rate, that he was out of fight, as it were,
in a inftant; and though I called and hallooed too
after him, it was all one; away he went, and in a
quarter of an hour I faw him come back again, though
not fo faft as he went; and as he came nearer, I
found his pace was flacker, becaufe he had fomething
in his hand.
When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite home for an earthen jug, or pot, to bring his
father fome frefh water; and that he had got two
more cakes or loaves of bread. The bread he gave
me, but the water he carried to his father: however,
as I was very thirsty too, I took a little fup of it:
this water revived his father more than all the rum or
fpirits I had given him; for he was just fainting with
thirft.
When his father had drank, I called him, to know
if there was any water left? he faid, Yes; and I bade
him give it to the poor Spaniard, who was in as much
want of it as his father; and I fent one of the cakes,
that Friday brought, to the Spaniard too, who was
indeed
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a
green place, under the fhade of a tree, and whofe
limbs were also very ftiff, and very much fwelled
•with the rude bandage he had been tied with: when I
faw that upon Friday's coming to him with the water,
he Tat up and drank, and took the bread, and began
to eat, I went to him, and gave him an handful of
raifins; he looked up in my face with all the tokens
of gratitude and thankfulnefs that could appear in any
countenance; but was fo weak, notwithstanding he
had fo exerted himfelf in the fight, that he could not
Rand upon his feet; he tried to do it two or three
times, but was really not able, his ankles were fo
f welled and fo painful to him; fo I bade him fit full, and caufed Friday to rub his ankles, and bathe them
with rum, as he had done his father's.
I obferved the poor affeclionate creature every two
minutes, or perhaps lefs, all the while he was here,
turned his head about, to fee if his father was in the
fame place and pofture as he left him fitting; and at
laft he found he was riot to be seen; at which he
started up, and, without fpeaking a word, flew with
that fwiftnefs to him, that one could scarce perceive
his feet to touch the ground as he went: but when he
came, he only found he had laid himfelf down to eafe
his limbs: fo Friday came back to me prefently, and
I then fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help him up,
if he could, and lead him to the boat, and then he
should carry him to our dwelling, where I would take
care of him: but Friday, a lufty young fellow, took
the Spaniard quite up upon his back, and carried him
away to the boat, and fet him down foftly upon the
fide or gunnel of the canoe, with his feet in the in-
fide
fide of it, and then lifted them quite in, and fct hirri
clofc to his father, and- prefently flepping out again,'
launched the boat off, and paddled it along the fhore
faster than I could walk, though the wind blew pretty
hard too; fo he brought them both fafe into our creek; and leaving them in the boat, runs away to
fetch the other canoe. As he paged me, I fpoke to
him, and afked him, whither he went? He told me^
Go fetch more boat; fo away he went, like the
. wind; for fure never man or horfe ran like him, and
he had the other canoe in the creek almost as soon as I got to it by land; fo he wafted me over, and then
went to help our new guests out of the boats, which he did; but they were neither of them
able to walk} fo that poor Friday knew not what
to do.
To remedy this, I went to work in my thought and calling to Friday to bid them fit down on the
-bank while he came to me, I foon made a kind of
hand-barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I carried
them up both together upon it between us; but when, we got them to the outfide of our wall or fortification^
we were at a worfe lofs than before; for it was im-
possible to get them over; and I was refolved not to
break it down: fo I fet to work again; and Friday
and I, in about two hours time, made a very hand-
fome tent, covered with old fails, and above that
with boughs of trees, being in the space without our
outward fence, and between that and the grove of
young wood which I had planted: and here we made
two beds of fuch things as I had; viz. of good rice-
straw, with blankets laid upon it to lie on, and another
to cover them on each bed.
My
My ifland was now peopled, and I thought myfelf
very rich in subjects ; and it was a merry reflection
which I frequently made, how like a king I looked:
first of all the whole country was my own mere pro-
perty; fo that I had an undoubted right of dominion: adly, My people were perfectly subjected : I was ab-
folute lord and lawgiver; they all owed their lives to
me, and were ready to lay down their lives, if there
had been occafion for it, for me: it was remarkable
too, I had but three subjects, and they were of three
different religions. My man Friday was a proteftant,
his father a pagan and a canibal; and the Spaniard
was a papist: however, I allowed liberty of con-
fcience throughout my dominions: but this by the
way.
As foon as I had fecured my two weak refcued pri-
foners, and given them fhelter, and a place to reft
them upon, I began to think of making fome pro-
vifion for them; and the first thing I did, I ordered
Friday to take a yearling goat, betwixt a kid and a
goat, out of my particular flock, to be killed: then I
cut off the hind quarter, and, chopping it into fmall
pieces, I fet Friday to work to boiling and ftawing,
and made them a very good difh, I aflure you, of flesh and broth; having put fome barley and rice alfo into
the broth, and as I cooked it without doors (for I
made no fire within my inner wall) fo I carried it all
into the new tent; and having fet a table there for
them, I fat down and eat my dinner alfo with them;
and, as well as I could, cheered them and en-
couraged them, Friday being my interpreter, efpe-
cially to his father, and indeed to the Spaniard too;
VOL. I. X for
for the Spaniard fpoke the language of the favageg
pretty well.
After we had dined, or rather flipped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the canoes, and go and fetch
our mufquets and other fire-arms, which, for want of
time, we had left upon the place of battle; and the
next day I ordered him to go and bury the dead
bodies of the favages, which lay open to the fun, and
would prefently be offensive ; and I alfo ordered him
to bury the horrid remains of their barbarous feast, which I knew were pretty much, and which I could
not think of doing myfelf; nay, I could not bear to
fee them, if I went that way: all which he punctually
performed, and defaced the very appearance of. the
favages being there; fo that when I went again, I
could fcarce know where it was, otherwife than by
the corner of the wood pointing to the place.
I then began to enter into a little converfation with-
my two new subjects; and firft I fet Friday to enquire-
of his father, what he thought of the efcape of the
favages in that canoe? and whether he might expect
a return of them with a power too great for us to re-
fifty? His firft opinion was, that the favages in the
boat never could jive out the storm which blew that
night they went off, but muft of necessity be drowned
or driven fouth to thofe other mores, where they were
as fure to be devoured, as they were to be drowned if
they were caft away; but as to, what they would do
if they came fafe on fhore, he faid, he knew not; but
it was his opinion, that they were fo dreadfully frighted
with the manner of being attacked, the noife, and the fire, that he believed they would tell their people
they
they were all killed by thunder and lightning, and
not by the hand of man; and that the two which ap-
peared (viz. Friday and I) were two heavenly fpirits
or furies come down to destroy them, and not men
with weapons. This, he faid, he knew, becaufe he
heard them all cry out fo in their language to one
another; for it was impoffible for them to conceive
that a man would dart fire, and fpeak thunder, and
kill at a diftance, without lifting up the hand,, as
was done now. And this old favage was in the
right, for, as I understood since by other hands, the
favages of that part never attempted to go over to the
ifland afterwards. They were fo terrified with the
accounts given by thefe four men (for it seems they
did efcape the fea), that they believed, whoever went
to that inchanted ifland, would be deftroyed with
fire from the gods.
This, however, I knew not, and therefore was
under continual apprehenfions for a good while, and
kept always upon my guard, I and all my army j
for as there were now four of us, I would have ven-
tured upon an hundred of them fairly in the open
field at any time.
In a little time, however, no more canoes ap-
pearing, the fear of their coming wore off, and I
began to take my former thoughts of a voyage to
the main into confideration, being likewife af-
fured by Friday's father, that I might depend upon good ufage from their nation on his account, if I
would go.
But my thoughts were a little fufpended, when I
had a ferious difcourfe with the Spaniard, and when
I understood, that there were fixteen more of his
X 2 countrymen
countrymen and Portuguefe, who having been caf£
away, and made their efcape to that fide, lived there
at peace indeed with the favages, but were very fore
put to it for neceflaries, and indeed for life: I afked
him all the particulars of their voyage; and found
they were a SfjnijIj fhip, bound from the Rio dc la
Plata to the Havanna, being directed to leave
their loading there, which was chiefly hides and fil-
ver, and to bring back what European goods they
could meet with there; that they had five Portuguesefeamen on board, whom they took out of another
wreck; that five of their own men were drowned
when firft the fhip was loft; and that thefe efcaped
through infinite dangers and hazards, and arrived
almoft ftarved on the Canibal coaft, where they ex-
pedted to have been devoured every moment.
He told me, they had fome arms with them, but
they were perfe&ly ufelefs, for that they had neither
powder or ball, the warning of the fea having
(polled all their powder, but a little which they
ufed at their fir ft landing to provide themfelves fome
food.
I asked him what he thought \\ ould become of them
there; and if they had formed no design of making
any efcape? He faid, they had many confultations
about it; but that having neither vefiel, nor tools to
build one, or provifions of any kind, their counsels always ended in tears and defpair.
I afked him, how he thought they would receive a
propofal from me, which might tend towards an
efcape; and whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done? I told him with freedom, I feared
mostly their treachery and ill ufage of me, if I put
my
my life in their hands; for that gratitude was no in-
herent virtue in the nature of man; nor did men
always fquare their dealings by the obligations they
had received, fo much as they did by the advantages
they expected: I told him, it would be very hard,
that I would be the instrument of their deliverance,
and that they would afterwards make me their pri-
foner in New Spain, where an Englishmanwas certain
to be made a facrifice, what necessity, or what ac-
cident foever, brought him thither; and that I had
rather be delivered up to the favages, and be devoured
alive, than fall into the mercilefs claws of the priefts,
and be carried into the Inquisition. I added, that
otherwife I was perfuaded, if they were all here, we
might, with fo many hands, build a bark large
enough to carry us all away either to the Braftls fouth-
ward, or to the iflands or Spanijb coaft northward:
but that if in requital they mould, when I had put
weapons into their hands, carry me by force among
their own people, I might be ill ufed for my kind nefs to them, and make my cafe worfe than it was
before.
He anfwered, with a great deal of candour and in-
genuity, that their condition was fo miferable, and
they were fo fenfible of it, that he believed they would
abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that
should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if
I pleafed, he would go to them with the old man,
and difcourfe with them about it, and return again,
and bring me their anfwer: that he would make con-
ditions with them upon their folemn oath, that they
would be abfolutely under my leading, as their com inander and captain; and that they mould fwear
X 3 upon
3IO LIFE AND ADVENTURES upon the holy facraments and gofpel, to be true to
me, and go to fuch chriftian country as I fhould
agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly
and abfolutely by my orders, till they were landed
fafely in fuch country as I intended; and that he would
bring a contract from them under their hands for that
purpofe.
Then he told me, he would firft fwear to me him-
felf, that he would never ftir from me as long as he
lived, till I gave him order; and that he would take
my fide to the laft drop of blood, if there fhould
happen the leaft breach of faith among his country- men.
He told me, they were all of them very civil honeft
men, and they were under the greatest diftrefs imagi-
nable,having neither weapons orclothes, nor any food,
but at the mercy and difcretion of the favages; out
of all hopes of ever returning to their own country;
and that he was fure, if I would undertake their re-
lief, they would live and die by me.
Upon thefe afiurances, I refolved to venture to re-
lieve them, if possible, and to fend the old favage and
this Spaniard over to them to treat: but when he had
gotten all things in readinefs to go, the Spaniard him-
felf ftarted an objection, which had fo much prudence
in it on one hand, and fo much sincerity on the other
hand, that I could not but be very well fatisfied in
it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of
his comrades for at leaft half a year. The cafe was
thus:
He had been with us now about a month; during
which time I had let him fee in what manner I had
provided, with the affiftance of Providence, for my
fupport;
fupport; and he faw evidently what ftock of corn and
rice I had lain up; which, as it was more than fuf-
ficient for myfelf, fo it was not sufficient, at leaft
without good hufbandry, for my family, now it was
increafed to number four: but much lefs would it be
fufficient, if his countrymen, who were, as he faid,
fourteen flill alive, should come over; and leaft of all
would it be fufficient to victual our veffel, if we would build one, for a voyage to any of the Christian co-
lonies of America. So he told me, he thought it
would be more advifeable, to let him and the other
two dig and cultivate fome more land, as much as I
could fpare feed to fow; and that we fbould wait
another harveft, that we might have a fupply of corn
for his countrymen when they would come; for want might be a temptation to them to difagree, or not to
think themfelves delivered, otherwife than out of one
difficulty into another: you know, fays he, the chil-
dren of Israel,though they rejoiced at first at their
being delivered out of Egypt, yet rebelled even against GOD himfelf, that delivered them, when they came to want bread in the wildernefs.
His caution was fo feafonable, and his advice fo
good, that I could not but be very well pleafed with
his propofal, as well as I was fatisfied with his fidelity:
fo we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the
wooden tools we were furnifhed with permitted; and
in about a month's time, by the end of which it was
feed-time, we had gotten as much land cured and
trimmed up as we fowed twenty-two bufheis of barley
on, and fixteen jars of rice, which was, in hon, all
the feed we had to fpare; nor indeed did we leave
ourfelves barley fufficient for our own food for the
fix months that we had to expect our crop, that is
to fay, reckoning from the time we fet our feed afide
for fowing; for it is not to be fuppofed it is fix months
in the ground in that country.
Having now fociety enough, and our number being
sufficient to put us out of fear of the favages, if they
had come, unlefs their number had been very great,
we went freely all over the ifland, where-ever we
found occafion; and as here we had our efcape or
deliverance upon our thoughts, it was impossible, at
leaft for me, to have the means of it out of mine; to
this purpofe, I marked out feveral trees, which I
thought fit for our work, and I fet Friday and his
father to cutting them down; and then I caufed the
Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that
affair, to overfee and dire& their work: I mewed
them with what indefatigable pains I had hewed a
large tree into fingle planks, and I caufed them to do
the like, till they had made about a dozen large
planks of good oak, near two feet broad, thirty-five
feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick:
what prodigious labour it took up, any one may
imagine.
At the fame time I contrived to increafe my little
flock of tame goats as much as I could; and to this
purpofe I made Friday and the Spaniard to go out one
day, and myfelf, with Friday, the next day, for we
took our turns: and by this means we got about
twenty young kids to breed up with the reft; for
whenever we met the dam, we faved the kids, and
added them to our flock: but above all, the feafon
for curing the grapes coming on, I caufed fuch a
prodigious quantity to be hung up in the fun, that I
believe,
believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raifins of
the fun are cured, we would have filled fixty or
eighty barrels; and thefe, with our bread, was a great
part of our food, and very good living too, I afiure
you; for it is an exceeding nourishing food.
It was now harveft, and our crop in good order;
it was not the moft plentiful increafe I had feen in the
ifland, but, however, it was enough to anfwer our
end; for from twenty-two bufhels of barley, we
brought in and threfhed out above two hundred and
twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the rice,
which was ftore enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the fixteen Spaniards had been
on fhore with me; or, if we had been ready for a
voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled
our fhip, to have carried us to any part of the world,
that is to fay, of America. When we had thus houfed
and fecured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to
make more wicker-work; viz. great baskets, in which
we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me, that I
did not make fome things for defence of this kind of
work; but I faw no need of it: and now having a
full fupply of food for all the guefts expected, I gave
the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to fee what
he could do with thofe he left behind him there: I
gave him a strict charge in writing not to bring any
man with him, who would not firft fwear, in the pre-
fence of himfelf and of the old favage, that he would
no way injure, fight with, or attack the perfon he
would find in the ifland, who was fo kind to fend for
them in order to their deliverance; but that they
would stand by and defend him against all such at-
tempts;
•
tempts; and wherever they went, would be en-
tirely under, and subjected to his command; and that
this fhould be put in writing, and figned with their
hands; how we were to have this done, when I knew
they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was a quef-
tion which we never asked. Under thefe inflruclions, the Spaniard,and the
old favage (the father of Friday} 'went away in one of
the canoes, which they might be faid to come in, or
rather were brought in, vi hen they came as prifoners
to be devoured by the favages.
I gave each of them a mufquet with a firelock on
it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them to be very good hufbands of both,
and not to ufe either of them but upon urgent oo
cafions.
This was a cheerful work, being the first meafures
ufed by me in view of my deliverance for now 27
years and fome days; I gave them provifions of
bread, and of dried grapes, sufficient for themfelves
for many days, and fufficient for their countrymen
for about eight days time; and wifhing them a good
voyage, I let them go, agreeing with them about a
signal they should hang out at their return, by which
I would know them again, when they came back, at
a diftance, before they came on fcore.
They went away with a fair gale on the day that
the moon was at the full; by my account in the
month of October; but as for the exact reckoning of
days, after I had once loft it, I could never recover
it again; nor had I kepfeven the number of years
fo punctually, as to be fure that I was right,
though, as it proved when I afterwards examined
my
my account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of
years.
It was no lefs than eight days I waited for them,
when a strange and unforefeen accident intervened,
of which the like has not, perhaps, been heard of in
hiftory. I was faft afleep in my hutch one morning,
when my man Friday came running in to me, and
called aloud, " Mafter, mafter, they are come, they
are come."
I jumped up,, and, regardlefs of danger, I went
out as foon as I could get my clothes on, through my
little grove, which (by the way) was by this time
grown to be a very thick wood; I fay, regardlefs of
danger, I went without my arms, which was not my
cuftom to do; but I was furprifed, when turning my
eyes to the fea, I presently faw a boat at about a
league and an half's diftance, ftanding in for the
fhore, with a shoulder of mutton fail, as they call it,
and the wind blowing pretty fair to bring them in:
alfo I obferved prefently, that they did not come from
that' fide which the more lay on, but from the
fouthermoft end of the ifland: upon this I called
Friday in, and bid him lie clofe, for thefe were
not the people we looked for, and that we
did not know yet whether they were friends or
enemies.
In the next place, I went in to fetch my perfpec-
tive-glafs, to fee what I could make of them; and
having taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top
of the hill, as I ufed to do when I was apprehenfive
of any thing, and to take my view the plainer without
being difcovered.
I had
I had fcarce fet my foot on the hill, when my eyeplainly difcovered a fhip lying at an anchor, at about
two leagues and a half's diftance from me, S. S. E-
but not above a league and an half from the shore- By my obfervation it appeared plainly to be an
Englishlip, and the boat appeared to be an Englishlong-boat.
I cannot exprefs the confufion I was in, though the
joy of feeing a ship, and one whom I had reafon to
believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
confequently friends, was fuch as I cannot defcribe;
but yet I had fome fecret doubts hung about me, I
cannot tell from whence they came, bidding me keep
upon my guard. In the first place, it occurred to
me to confider what bufinefs an Er.gl'Jh fhip could
have in that part of the world; since it was not the
way to or from any part of the world where the Engiijh had any traffick; and I knew there had been no
ftorms to drive them in there, as in distress ; and
that if they were Englishreally, it was moft proba-
ble that they were here upon no good defign; and
that I had better continue as I was, than fall into the
hands of thieves and murderers.
Let no man defpife the fecret hints and notices of
danger, which fometimes are given him when he
may think there is no poffibility of its being real.
That fuch hints and notices are given us, I believe
few that have made any obfervations of things can
'deny; that they are certain difcoveries of an invifible
world, and a converfe of fpirits, we cannot doubt;
and if the tendency of them feems to be to warn us of
danger, why would we not suppose they _are from
fome
Ibme friendly agent (whether fupreme, or inferior and
fubordinate, is not the queftion), and that they are
given for our good?
The prefent question abundantly confirms me in the
justice of this reafoning ; for had I not been made cau-
tious by this fecret admonition, come from whence it
will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far
worse condition than before, as you will fee prefently.
I had not kept myfelf long in this pofture, but I
faw the boat draw near the shore, as if they looked
for a creek to thruft in at for the convenience of
landing ; however, as they did not come quite far
enough, they did not fee the little inlet where I for-
merly landed my rafts, but run their boat on shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which
was very happy for me; for otherwife they would
have landed juft, as I may fay, at my door, and
would have foon beaten me out of my caftle, and,
perhaps, have plundered me of all I had.
When they were on Gore, I was fully fatisfied they
were Englishmen,at leaft moft of them; one or two I
thought were Dutch, but it did not prove fo: there
were in all eleven men, whereof three of them I
found were unarmed, and (as I thought) bound; and
when the firft four or five of them were jumped on
fhore, they took thofe three out of the boat as prifon-
.ers: one of the three I could perceive using the moft
paffionate geftures of intreaty, affliction, and defpair,
even to a kind of extravagance; the other two, I
could perceive, lifted up their hands fometimes, and
appeared concerned indeed, but not to fuch a degree
as the first. I was
I was perfectly confounded at the fight, and knew not what the meaning of it fhould be; Friday called
out to me in English,as well as he could, O master !
you fee Englishmans eat prifoners as well as favage
mans. Why, faid I, Friday, do you think they are
going to eat them then? Yes, fays Friday, they will
eat them. No, no, faid I, Friday; I am afraid they
'will murder them indeed; but you may be fure they
will not eat them.
All this while I had no thought of what the matter
really was, but stood trembling with the horror of
the fight, expecting every moment when the three
prifoners fhould be killed; nay, once I faw one of
the villains lift up his arm with a great cutlace (as
the feamen call it) or fword, to strike one of the poor
men; and I expected to fee him fall every moment,
at which all the blood in my body feemed to run chill
in my veins.
I wished heartily now for our Spaniard, and the
favage that was gone with him; or that I had any
way to have come undifcovcred within most of them,
that I might have refcued the three men; for I faw
no fire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to
my mind another way.
After I had obferved the outrageous ufage of the
three men by the infolent feamen, I obferved the
fellows ran fcattering about the land, as if they
wanted to fee the country: I observed alfo, that the
three other men had liberty to go where they pleafed;
but they fat down all three upon the ground very
penfive, and looked like men in defpair.
This put me in mind of the firft time when I came
on more, and began to look about me; how I gave
myfelf
tnyfelf over for loft, how wildly I looked round me,
what dreadful apprehenfions I had, and how I lodged
in the tree all night for fear of being devoured by
wild beasts. As I knew nothing that night of the fupply I was
to receive by the providential driving of the fhip
nearer the land, by the ftorms and tides, by which
I have fince been fo long nourished and fupported j
fo thefe three poor defolate men knew nothing how
certain of deliverance and fupply they were, how
near it was to them, and how effectually and really
they/were in a condition of fafety, at the fame time
they thought themfelves loft, and their cafe defpe-
rate.
So little do we fee before us in the world, and fo
much reafon have we to depend cheerfully upon the
great Maker of the world, that he does not leave his
creatures fo abfolutely deftitute, but that in the worst circumftances they have always fomething to be
thankful for, and fometimes are nearer their deliver-
ance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to
their deliverance by the means by which they feem to
be brought to their destruction. It was juft at the top of high-water when thefe
people came on shore, and while partly they flood
parlying with the prifoners they brought, and partly
while they rambled about to fee what kind of place
they were in, they had carelefsly ftaid till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed confiderably
away, leaving their boat aground.
They had left two men in the boat, who, as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
brandy, fell asleep ; however, one of them waking
fooner
520 LIFE AND ADVENTURE 'fooner than the other, and finding the boat too fail aground for him to ftir it, hallooed for the reft who
were ftraggling about, upon which they all foon
came to the boat; but it was paft all their ftrength
to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the
fhore on that fide being a foft oufy fand, almost like a
quickfand.
In this condition, like true feamen, who are, per-
haps, the leads of all mankind given to forethought,
they gave it over, and away they ftrolled about the
country again; and I heard one of them fay aloud to
another (calling them off from the boat), Why, let
her alone, yack, can't ye? fhe'll float next tide: by
which I was fully confirmed in the main enquiry, of
what countrymen they were.
All this while I kept myfelf clofe, not once daring
to stir out of my caftle, any farther than to my place
of obfervation, near the top of the hill; and very
glad I was, to think how well it was fortified: I
knew it was no lefs than ten hours before the boat
could be on float again, and by that time it would be
dark, and I might be more at liberty to fee their mo-
tions, and to hear their difcourfe, if they had any.
In the mean time I fitted myfelf up for a battle, as
before, though with more caution, knowing I had to
do with another kind of enemy than I had at firft: I
ordered Friday alfo, whom I had made an excellent
markfman with his gun, to load himfelf with arms:
I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him
three mufquets: my figure, indeed, was very fierce;
I had my formidable goat fkin coat on, with the
great cap I mentioned, a naked fword, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each fhoulder.
It
tt was my defign, as I faid above, not to have
made any attempt till it was dark; but about two
o'clock, being the heat of the day, I found that in
fhort they were all gone ftraggling into the woods,
and, as I thought, were all laid down to sleep : the
three poor diftrefled men, too anxious for their con-
dition to get any fleep, were however fet down under
the fhelter of a great tree, at about a quarter of a
mile from me, and as I thought, out of fight of any
of the rest. Upon this I refolved to difcover myfelf to them,
and learn fomething of their condition : immediately
I marched in the figure above, my man Friday at a
good distance behind me, as formidable for his arms
as I, but not making quite fo ftaring a fpectre-like
figure as I did.
I came as near them undifcovered as I could, and
then, before any of them faw me, I called aloud to
them in Spanish,What are ye, Gentlemen?
They ftarted up at the noife, but were ten times
more confounded when they faw me, and the un-
couth figure that I made: they made no answer at
all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly
from me, when I fpoke to them in English: Gen-
tlemen, faid I, do not be furprifed at me; perhaps
you may have a friend near you, when you did not
expect it: He muftbefent diredUy from Heaven then,
faid cue of them very gravely to me, pulling off his
hat at the fame time, for our condition is part the
help of man. All help is from Heaven, Sir, faid I:
but can you put a ftranger in the way how to help
you ? For you Teem to me to be in fome great diftrefs:
I faw you when you landed; and when you feemed
VOL. I. Y to
to make application to the brutes that came with
you, I faw one of them lift up his sword to kill you.
The poor man, with tears running down his face,
and trembling, looking like one aftonifhed, re-
turned, Am I talking to GOD or man? Is it a real
man, or an angel ? lie in no fear about that, Sir,
laid I: if GOD had fent an angel to relieve you, he
would have come better clothed, and armed after
another manner than you fee me in; pray lay afide
your fears; I am a man, an Englishman,and difpofed
to affift you; you fee I have one fervant only; we
have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we ferve you ?—What is your cafe?
Our cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our murderers are fo near; but in fhort, Sir,
I was commander of that fhip; my men having mu-
tinied against me, they have been hardly prevailed
on not to murder me, and at laft have fet me on more
in this defolate place, with thefe two men with me,
one my mate, the other a passenger, where we ex pected to perish, believing the place to be unin-
habited,- and know not yet what to think of it.
Where are thofe brutes, your enemies? faid I; Do
you know where they are gone? There they are, Sir,
laid he, pointing to a thicket of trees; my heart
trembles for fear they have feen us, and heard you
fpeak; if they have, they will certainly murder
us all.
Havetheyany fire-arms? faid I: he anfwered, They
had only tvK.d pieces, and one which they left in the
boat. Well then, faid I, leave the reft to me; I fee
they are all asleep ; it is an eafy thing to kill them all;
but hall we rather take them prifoners? He told me
there
there were two defperate villains among them, that it
was fcarce fafe to mew any mercy to; but if they
were fecured, he believed all the reft would return
to their duty: I asked him, Which they were? He
told me, he could not at that diftance defcribe them;
but he would obey my orders in any thing I would
direct. Well, faid I, let us retreat out of their view
or hearing, left they awake, and we will refolve far-
ther ;. fo they willingly went back with me, till the
woods covered us from them.
Look you, Sir, faid I, if I venture upon your de-
liverance, are you willing to make two conditions
with me? He anticipated my propofals, by telling me,
that both he and the lip, if recovered, would be
wholly directed and commanded by me in every
thing; and if the lip was not recovered, he would
live and die with me in what part of the world foever
I would fend him; and the two other men faid the
fame.
Well, faid I, my conditions are but two: i. That
while you ftay on this ifland with me, you will not
pretend to any authority' here; and if I put arms into
your hands, you will upon all occasions give them up
to me, and do no prejudice to me or mine, upon this
ifland, and in the mean time to be governed by my
orders.
2. That if the fhip is or may be recovered, you
will carry me and my man to England, paffage free.
He gave me all the afTurance that the invention
and faith of a man could devife, that he would com-
ply with thefe moft reafonable demands, and befides,
would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon
all occafions as long as he lived.
Y 2 Well
Well then, faid I, here are three mufqi'ets for you,
with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is
proper to be done: he fhewed all the testimony of
his gratitude that he was able; but offered to be
wholly guided by me: I told him, I thought it was
hard venturing any thing, but the beft method I
could think of, was to fire upon them at once, as
they lay ; and if any were not killed at the firft volley,
and offered to fubmit, we might fave them, and fo
put it wholly upon GOD'S providence to direct the
fhot.
He faid, very modeftly, that he was loth to kill
them, if he could help it; but that thofe two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all
the mutiny in the lip ; and if they efcaped, we
fhould be undone flill; 'for they would go on board,
and bring the whole ship's company, and deflroy us
all. Well then, faid I, neceffity legitimates my ad-
vice; for it is the only way to fave our lives. How-
ever, feeing him flill cautious of fhedding blood, I
told him, they fhould go themfelves, and manage as
they found convenient.
In the middle of this difcourfc we heard fome of
them awake, and foon after we faw two of them on
their feet: I asked him, if either of them were the
men who he had faid were the heads of the mutiny?
He faid, No. Well then, faid I, you may let them
efcape, and Providence feems to have wakened them
on purpofe to fave themfelves: Now. faid I, if the
reft efcape you, it is your fault.
Animated with this, he took the mufquet I had
given him in his hand, and pistol in his belt, and
his two comrades with him, with each man a piece
in
mills hand: the two men, who were with him, go-
ing first, made fome noife, at which one of the lea-
men, who was awake, turned about, and feeing
them coming, cried out to the reft; but it was too
late then; for the moment he cried out, they fired,
I mean the two men, the captain wifely referving his
own piece: they had fo well aimed their mot at the
men they knew, that one of them was killed on the
fpot, and the other very much wounded; but not
being dead, he ftarted up on his feet, and called
eagerly for help to the other; but the captain, step- ping to him, told him it was too late to cry for help;
he would call upon GOD to forgive his villany; and
with that word knocked him down with the flock of
his mufquet, fo that he never fpoke more: there
were three more in the company, and one of them
was also slightly wounded: by this time I was come;
and when they faw their danger, and that it was in
vain to refill, they begged for mercy. The captain
told them, he would fpare their lives, if they would
give him any affurance of their abhorrence of the trea-
chery they had been guilty of, and would fwear to
be faithful to him in recovering the ship, and after-
wards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from whence
they came. They gave him all the proteftations of
their sincerity that could be defired, and he was will-
ing to believe them, and fpare their lives, which I
was not againft; only I obliged him to keep them bound hand and foot while they were upon the
island. While this was doing, I fent Friday with the
captain's mate to the boat, with orders to fecure
her, and bring away the oars and fail, which they
Y 3 did;
did; and by and bye, three ftraggling men, that
were (happily for them) parted from the reft, came
back upon hearing the guns fired; and feeing their
captain, who before was their prifoner, now their
conqueror, they fubmitted to be bound also, and fo
our victory was complete.
It now remained, that the captain and I should enquire into one anothei's circumftances: I began
first, and told him my whole hiftory, which he heard
with an attention even to amazement, and particu-
larly at the wonderful manner of my being furnifhed
with provifions and ammunition; and indeed, as my
glory is a whole collection of wonders, it affected him deeply; but when he reflected from thence upon
himfelf, and how I feemed to have been preferved
there on purpofe to fave his life, the tears ran down
his face, and he could not fpeak a word more.
After this communication was at an end, I carried
him and his two men into my apartments, leading
them in jufl. where I came out, viz. at the top of the
houfe; where I refrefhed them with fuch provifions
as I had, and mowed them all the contrivances I had
made during my long, long inhabiting that place.
All I mewed them, all I faid to them, was perfectly
amazing; but, above all, the captain admired my
fortification; and how perfectly I had concealed my
retreat with a grove of the trees, which, having now
been planted near twenty years, and the trees grow-
ing much faster than in England, was become a little
wood, and fo thick, that it was unpaflable in any
part of it, but at that one fide where I had referved
my little winding paflage into it: this I told him was
my castle, and my refidence; but that I had a feat
in
In the country, as moft princes have, whither I
could retreat upon occafion, and I would fhew him
that too another time; but at prefent our bufinefs
was to confider how to recover the fhip. He agreed
with me as to that; but told me, he was perfectly at
a Icfs what meafure to take; for that there were full fix-and-twenty hands on board, who having entered
into a curfed confpiracy, by which they had all for-
feited their lives to the law, would be hardened in
it now by defperation ; and would carry it on, know-
ing that if they were reduced, they fhould be brought
to the gallows as foon as they came to England, or to
any of the Englishcolonies; and that therefore there
would be no attacking them with fo finally a number
as we were.
I mufed for fome time upon what he had faid, and
found it was a very rational conclufion, and that
therefore fomething was to be refolved on very
fpeedily, as well to draw the men on board into fome
fnare for their furprife, as to prevent their landing
upon us, and destroying us: upon this it prefently
occurred to me, that in a little while, the fhip's crew,
wondering what was become of their comrades, and
of the boat, would certainly come on fhore in their
other boat to fee for them; and that then perhaps
they might come armed, and be too ftrong for us:
this, he allowed, was rational.
Upon this I told him, the firft thing we had to do,
was to stave the boat, which lay upon the beach, fo
that they might not carry her off; and, taking every
thing out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs as not to be
fit to fwim; accordingly we went on board, took the
arms which were left on board out of her, and what-
Y 4 ever
everelfewe found there, which was a bottle of brandy,
and another of rum, a few bifcuit cakes, an horn of
powder, and a great lump of fugar in a piece of can-
vas; the fugar was five or fix pounds; all which was
very welcome to me, efpecially the brandy and fugar,
of which I had had none left for many years.
When we had carried all thefe things on more (the
oars, niaft, fail, and rudder of the boat, were carried
before, as above) we knocked a great hole in her
bottom, that if they had come ftrong enough tomafter
us, yet they could not carry off the boat.
Indeed it was not much in my thoughts, that we
could be capable to recover the fhip; but my view
was, that if they went away without the boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again to carry us
away to the Leeward Iflands, and call upon our
friends the Spaniards in my way, for I had them ftill
in my thoughts.
While we were thus preparing our designs, and
had firft, by main ftrength, heaved the boat up upon
the beach, fo high that the tide would not float her
off at high-water mark; and, befides, had broken
an hole in her bottom, too big to be quickly flopped,
and were fat down mufing what we fhould do; • we
heard the fhip fire a gun, and faw her make a waft
with her ancient, as a fignal for the boat to come on
board; but no boat ftirred; and they fired feveral
times, making other fignals for the boat.
At laft, when all their fignals and firings proved
fruitlefs, and they found the boat did not ftir, we
faw them (by the help of our glaffcs) hoist another
boat out, and row towards the shore ; and we found,
as
as they approached, that there were no lefs than ten
men in her, and that they had fire arms with them.
As the fhip lay almoft two leagues from the more,
we had a full view of them as they came, and a plain
fight of the men, even of their faces; becaufe the
tide having fet them a little to the aft of the other
boat, they rowed up under more, to come to the
fame place where the other had landed, and where
the boat lay.
By this means, I fay, we had a full view of them,
and the captain knew the perfons and characters of all
the men in the boat; of whom he faid that there
were three very honeft fellows, who, he was fure,
were led into this confpiracy by the reft, being over-
powered and frighted.
But that for the boatfwain, who, it feems, was
the chief officer among them, and all the reds, they
were as outrageous as any of the fhip's crew; and
were, no doubt, made defperate in their new enter-
prize; and terribly apprehenfive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us.
I finiled at him, and told him, that men in our cir cumftances were paft the operations of fear: that
feeing almoft every condition that could be was better
than that we were fuppofed to be in, we ought to ex-
pect that the confequence, whether death or life,
would be fare to be a deliverance; I afked him, what
he thought of the circumftances of my life, and
whether a deliverance were not worth venturing for?
And where, Sir, faid I, is your belief of my being pre-
ferved here on purpofe to fave your life, which ele-
vated you a little while ago? For my part, faid I,
there feems to be but one thing arriifs in all the pro-
fped
fpect of it. What's that? fays he. Why, faid I,
'tis that, as you fay, there are three or four honeft
fellows among them, which would be fpared;
had they been all of the wicked part of the crew,
I would have thought GOD'S providence had fingled
them out to deliver them into your hands; for, de-
pend upon it, every man of them that comes ashore, are our own, and small die or live, as they behave
to us.
As I fpoke this with a raifed voice, and cheerful
countenance, I found it greatly encouraged him; fo
we fet vigoroufly to our bufinefs: we had, upon the
first appearance of the boat's coming from the fhip,
confidered of feparating our prisoners, and had in-
deed fecured them effectually.
Two of them, of whom the captain was lefs af-
fured than ordinary, I fent with Friday, and one of
the three (delivered men) to my cave, where they
were remote enough, and out of danger of being
heard or difcovered, or of finding their way out of
the woods, if they could have delivered themfelves:
here they left them bound, but gave them provifions,
and promifed them, if they continued there quietly, to
give them their liberty in a day or two; but that if
they attempted their efcape, they would be put to
death without mercy. They promifed faithfully to
bear their confinement with patience, and were very
thankful that they had fuch good ufage as to have
prqvifions, and a light left them; for Friday gave
them candles (fuch as we made ourfelves) for their
comfort; and they did not know but that he ftood
centinel over them at the entrance.
The
The other prifoners had better ufage; two of them
•were kept pinioned indeed, becaufe the captain was
not free to trust them; but the other two were taken
into my fervice upon their captain's recommendation,
and upon their folemnly engaging to live and die
with us; fo, with them and the three honeft men,
we were feven men well armed; and I made no
doubt we should be able to deal well enough with the
ten that were a coming, confidering that the captain
had faid, there were three or four honeft men among
them alfo.
As foon as they got to the place where their other
boat lay, they ran their boat into the beach, and
came all on lore, hauling the boat up after them,
which I was glad to fee •; for I was afraid they would
rather have left the boat at an anchor, fome diftance
from the more, with fome hands in her to guard her;
and fo we would not be able to feize the boat.
Being on more, the firft thing they did, they ran
all to the other boat; audit was eafy to fee they were
under a great furprife to find her stripped, as above,
of all that was in her, and a great hole in her bot-
tom.
After they had mufed awhile upon this, they fet
up two or three great fhouts, hallooing with all their
might, to try if they could make their companions
hear; but all was to no purpofe; then they came
all clofe in a ring, and fired a volley of their finall
arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made
the woods ring; but it was all one; thofe in the
cave, we were fure, could not hear; and thofe in
our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet
durst give no anfwer to them.
They
They were fo aftonifhed at the furprife of this, that,
as they told us afterwards, they refolved to go all on
board again to their fhip, and let them know there,
that the men were all murdered, and the long-boat
ftaved; accordingly, they immediately launched the
boat again, and got all of them on board.
The captain was terribly amazed, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on board
the fhip again, and fet fail, giving their comrades up
for loft, and fo he fhould ftill lofe the fhip, which
he was in hopes we fhould have recovered; but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.
They had not been long put off with the boat, but
we perceived them all coming on lore again; but
"i", ./with this new meafure in their conduct, which, it
''.'Jeems, they confulted together upon; viz. to leave
three men in the boat, and the raft to go on fhore,
and go up into the country to look for their fellows.
This was a great difappointment to us; for now
we were at a lofs what to do; for our feizing thofe
seven men on fhore would be no advantage to us if we
let the boat efcape, becaufe they would then row
away to the fhip; and then the reft of them would
be fure to weigh, and fet fail, and fo our recovering
the fhip would be loft.
However, we had no remedy but to wait and fee
what the iffue of things might prefent: the feven men
came on lore, and the three who remained in the
boat put her off to a good diftance from the fhore,
and came to an anchor to wait for them; fo that
it was impoffible for us to come at them in the
boat.
Thofe
*>..;'"
Thofe that came on more kept clofe together,
marching towards the top of the little hill, under
which my habitation lay; and we could fee them
plainly, though they could not perceive us: we
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, fo that we might have fired at them;
or that they would have gone farther off, that we
might have come abroad.
But when they were come to the brow of the hill,
where they could fee a great way in the valley and
woods, which lay towards the north-eaft part, and
where the island lay loweft, they fhouted and hallooed
till they were weary; and not caring, it feems, to
venture far from the flrore, nor far from one ano-
ther, they fat down together under a tree, to con,
fider of it: had they thought fit to have gone to fleep
there, as the other party of them had done, they had
done the job for us; but they were too full of ap-
prehenfions of danger, to venture to go to fleep,
though they could not tell what the danger was they
had to fear neither.
The captain made a very jull propofal to me upon
this confultation of theirs; viz. that perhaps they
would all fire a volley again, to endeavour to make
their fellows hear, and that we fhould all fully upon
them, just at the juncture when their pieces were all
difcharged, and they would certainly yield, and we
fhould have them without bloodfhed. I liked the
propofal, provided it was done while we were near
. enough to come up to them, before they could load
their pieces again.
But
But this event did not happen, and we lay ftill a
long time, very irrefolute what courfe to take; at
length I told them, there would be nothing to be
done in my opinion till night; and then, if they did
not return to the boat, perhaps we might find a way
to get between them and the lore, and fo might ufe
fome stratagem with them in the boat, to get them
on lore. We waited a great while, though very impatient
for their removing, and were very uneafy: when,
after long confultations, we faw them ftart all up,
and march down toward the fea: it feems, they had
fuch dreadful apprehenfions upon them of the dan-
ger of the place, that they resolved to go on board
the lip again, give their companions over for lofl,
and fo go on with their intended voyage with the
fhip.
As foon as I perceived them go towards the fhore,
I imagined it to be as it really was; that they had
given over their fearch, and were for going back
again; and the captain, as fcon as I told him my
thoughts, was ready to fork at the apprehenfions of
it; but I prefently thought of a stratagem to fetch
them back again, and which anfwered my end to
a tittle.
I ordered Friday, and the captain's mate, to go
over the little creek weftward, towards the place
where the favages came on shore when Friday was
refcued; and as foon as they came to a little rifing
ground, at about half a mile's distance, I bade them
halloo as loud as they could, and wait till they found
the feamen heard them; that as foon as ever they
heard
heard the feamen anfwer them, they should return it
again, and then, keeping out of fight, take a round,
always anfwering when the others hallooed, to draw
them as far into the ifland, and among the woods, as
possible, and then wheel about again to me, by fuch
ways as I directed.
They were juft going into the boat, when Friday
and the mate hallooed, and they prefently heard them, and anfwering, run along the more westward, to-
wards the voice they heard, when they were pre-
fently stopped by the creek, where the water being
up, they could not get over, and called for the
boat to come up, and fet them over, as indeed I
expected. When they had fet themselves over, I obferved
that the boat being gone up a good way into the
creek, and as it were in an harbour within the land,
they took one of the three men out of her to go along
with them, and left only two in the boat, having
faftened her to the ftump of a little tree on the
more.
This was what I wifhed for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the captain's mate to their bufmefs,
I took the raft with me, and, croffing the creek out
of their fight, we furprifed the two men before they
were aware, one of them lying on more, and the
other being in the boat; the fellow on more was be-
tween fleeping and waking, and going to ftart up, the
captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and
knocked him down, and then called out to him in the
boat to yield, or he was a dead man.
There
There needed very few arguments to perfuade £
fingle man to yield, when he faw five men upon himi
and his comrade knocked down; befides, this was,
it feems, one of the three who were not fo hearty in
the mutiny as the reft of the crew, and therefore was
easily perfuaded not only to yield, but afterwards to
join very sincerely with us.
In the mean time, Friday and the captain's mate fo
•well managed their business with the rest, that they
drew them, by hallooing and anfwering, from one
hill to another, and from one wood to another, till
they not only heartily tired them, but left them where
they were very fure they could not reach back to the
boat before it was dark; and indeed they were
heartily tired themfelves alfo by the time they came
back to us.
We had nothing now to do but to watch for them
in the dark, and to fall upon them, fo as to make fure work with them.
It was feveral hours after Friday came back to me
before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremoft of them, long before they came
quite up, calling to thofe behind to come along; and
could alfo hear them anfwer, and complain how lame
and tired they were, and not being able to come any
faster, which was very welcome news to us.
At length they came up to the boat; but it is im-
poffible to exprefs their confufion, when they found
the boat faft a-ground in the creek. The tide ebbed
out, and their two men gone; we could hear them
call to. one another in a moft lamentable manner,
telling one another they were gotten into an enchanted
ifland; that either there were inhabitants in it, and
they
they fhould all be murdered; or elfe there Were
devils or fpirits in it, and they fhould be all carried
away and devoured.
They hallooed again, and called their two comrades
by their names a great many times, but no anfwer:
after fome time, we could fee them, by the little light
there was, run about wringing their hands, like men
in defpair; and that fometimes they would go and
fit down in the boat to reft themfelves, then come
ashore, and walk about again, and fo the fame thing
over again.
My men would fain have had me given them leave
to fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was
willing to take them at fome advantage, fo to fpare
them, and kill as few of them as I could; and
efpecially I was unwilling to hazard the killing any
of our men, knowing the other men were very well
armed: I refolved to wait to fee if they did not fe-
parate; and therefore, to makefure of them, I drew
my ambufcade nearer; and ordered Friday and the
captain to creep upon their hands and feet as clofe to
the ground as they could, that they might not be
difcovered, and get as near them as they could pof-
fibly, before they offered to fire.
They had not been long in that posture, till
the boatfwain, who was the principal ringleader of
the mutiny, and had now fhewn himfelf the moft
dejected and difpirited of all the reft, came walking
towards them with two more of the crew; the captain
was fo eager, at having the principal rogue fo much
in his power, that he could hardly have patience to
let him come fo near as to be fure of him; for they
only heard his tongue before: but when they came
VOL. I. Z nearer,
nearer, the captain and Friday, ftarting up on their
feet, let fly at them.
The boatfwain was killed upon the fpot; the next
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him, though
he did not die till an hour or two after; and the third
run for it.
At the noife of the fire, I immediately advanced
with my whole army, which was now eight men;
viz. myfelf generaliffimo; Friday my lieutenant,
general; the captain and his two men, and the
three prifoners of war, whom he had trufted with arms.
We came upon them indeed in the dark, fo that
they could not fee our number; and I made the man
they had left in the boat, who was now one of us, to
call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a
parley, and fo might perhaps reduce them to terms;
which fell out just as we defired: for indeed it was
eafy to think, as their condition then was, they would
be very willing to capitulate; fo he calls out, as loud
as he could, to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith.
Tom Smith anfwered immediately, Who's that! Ro-
binfon! For it feems he knew his voice. The other
anfwered, Ay, ay; for GOD'S fake, Tom Smith, throw
down your arms, and yield, or you are all dead men
this moment.
Who muft we yield to? Where are they? fays
Smith again. Here they are, fays he; here is our
captain and fifty men with him, have -been hunting
you this two hours; the boatfwain is killed; Will
Frye is wounded, and I am a prifoner; and if you
do not yield, you are all loft.
Will they give us quarter then? fays Tom Smith,
and we will yield. I'll go and alk, if you promise to
yield.
yield, fays Robinfon. So he afked the captain, and
the captain himfelf then calls out; You, Smith, you
know my voice, if you lay down your arms imme-
diately, and fubmit, you fhall have your lives, all but
Will Atkins.
Upon this Will Atkins cried out, For GOD'S fake,
captain, give me quarter: what have I done? they
have been all as bad as I: (which by the way was not
true, either; for it feems this Will Atkins was the
first man that laid hold of the captain when they firft
mutined, and ufed him barbaroufly, in tying his
hands, and giving him injurious language :) how-
ever, the captain told him he muft. lay down his
arms at difcretion, and trust to the governor's mer-
cy, by which he, meant me; for they all called me
governor.
In a word, they all laid down their arms, and
begged their lives; and I fent the man that had
parlied with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,
particularly with thofe three, were all but eight, came up and feized upon them all, and upon their
boat, only that I kept myfelf and one more out of
fight, for feafons of state. Our next work was to repair the boat, and to think
of feizing the fhip; and as for the captain, now he
had leifure to parley with them, he expoftulated with
them upon the villainy of their practices with him,
and at length, upon the farther wickednefs of their
defign; and how certainly it muft bring them to
mifery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the
gallows. /
Z « They
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard
for their lives: as for that, he told them they were
none of his prifoners, but the commander's of the
island ; that they thought they had fet him on more
in a barren uninhabited island ; but it had pleafed
GOD fo to direct them, that the ifland was inhabited,
and that the governor was an Englijhman; that he
might hang them all there, if he pleafed; but as he had
given them all quarter, he fuppofed he would fend
them to England,to be dealt with there as juftice
required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded
by the governor to advife to prepare for death; for
that he would be hanged in the morning.
Though this was all a fiction of his own, yet it
had its defired effect: Atkins fell upon his knees to
beg the captain to intercede with the governor for his
life; and all the reft begged of him for GOD'S fake,
that they might not be fent to England.
It now occurred to me, that the time of our deliver-
ance was come, and that it would be a moft eafy
thing to bring thefe fellows in to be hearty in getting
poffeffion of the ship; fo I retired in the dark from
them, that they might not fee what kind of a gover-
nor they had, and called the captain to me; when I
called, as at a good diftance, one of the men was
ordered to fpeak again, and fay to the captain, Cap-
tain, the commander calls for you; and prefently the
captain replied, Tell his excellency I am just a com-
ing. This more perfectly amufed them; and they
all believed, that the commander was juft by with
his fifty men.
Upon the captain's coming to me, I told, him my
project for feizing the map, which he liked won-
derfully
derfully well, and refolved to put it in execution the
next morning.
But, in order to execute it with more art, and to
be fecure of fuccefs, I told him we muft divide the
prifoners, and that he would go and take Atkins, and
two more of the worft of them, and fend them
pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was
committed to Friday, and the two men who came on
shore with the captain.
They conveyed them to the cave, as to a prison ;
and it was indeed a difmal place, efpecially to men in
their condition.
The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it,
of which I have given a full defcription; and as it
was fenced in, and they pinioned, the place was
fecure enough, confidering they were upon their be-
haviour.
To thefe in the morning I fent the captain, who
was to enter into a parley with them; in a word, to
try them, and tell me, whether he thought they
might be trufted or no, to go on board, and furprife
the lip : he talked to them of the injury done him,
of the condition they were brought to; and that
though the governor had given them quarter for their
lives, as to the prefent acHon, yet that if they were
sent to England, they would all be hanged in chains,
to be fure; but that if they would join in fuch an
attempt, as to recover the lip, he would have the
governor's engagement for their pardon.
Any one may guefs how readily fuch a propofal
would be accepted by men in their condition; they
fell down on their knees to the captain, and pro-
Z 3 mifed
mifed with the deepest imprecations, that they would
be faithful to him to the laft drop, and that they
fhould owe their lives to him, and would go with him
all over the world; that they would own him for a
father to them as long as they lived.
Well, fays the captain, I muft go and tell the go-
vernor what you fay, and fee what I can do to bring
him to confent to it: fo he brought me an account
of the temper he found them in; and that he verily
believed they would be faithful.
However, that we might be very fecure, I told him
he would go back again, and choofe out five of them,
and tell them, that they mould fee that they did not
want men; but he would take out thofe five to be his
assistants, and that the governor would keep the other
two, and the three that were fent prifoners to the
cattle, (my cave) as hoftages, for the fidelity of thofe
five; and that if they proved unfaithful in the exe-
cution, the five hostages would be hanged in chains
alive upon the fhore.
This looked fevere, and convinced them that the
governor was in earnef t; however, they had no way
left them but to accept it; and it was now the bufinefs
of the prifoners, as much as of the captain, to per-
fuade the other five to do their duty.
Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedi-
tion: i. The captain, his mate, and passenger. 2.
Then the two prifoners of the firft gang, to whom,
having their characters from the captain, I had given
their liberty, and trufted them with arms. 3. The
other two whom I kept till now in my bower
pinioned; but, upon the captain's motion, had now
releafed.
releafed. 4. Thefe five releafed at laft; fo that they
were twelve in all, besides five we kept prifoners in
the cave for hoftages.
I asked the captain if he was willing to*venture with
thefe hands on board the fhip: for, as for me, and
my man Friday, I did not think it was proper for us to
ftir, having feven men left behind; and it was em-
ployment enough for us to keep them afunder, and
fupply them with victuals.
As to the five in the cave, I refolved to keep them
fall ; but Friday went twice a day to them, to fupply
them with necessaries ; and I made the other two
carry provifions to a certain distance, where Friday
was to take it.
When I mewed myfelf to the two hoftages, it was
with the captain, who told them, I was the perfon
the governor had ordered to look after them, and
that it was the governor's pleafure that they would not ftir any where but by my direction ; that if they
did, they would be fetched into the caftle, and be
laid in irons; fo that as we never fuffered them to fee
me as governor, fo I now appeared as another perfon,
and fpoke of the governor, the garrifon, the caftle,
and the like, upon all occafions.
The captain now had no difficulty before him, but
to furnifh his two boats, ftop the breach of one, and
man them: he made his passenger captain of one,
with four other men; and himfelf, and his mate,
and five more, went in the other: and they con-
trived their bufinefs very well; for they came up to
the fhip about midnight: as foon as they came within
call of the fhip, he made Robinsonhail them, and
Z 4 tell
tell them he had brought off the men and the boat, but
that it was a long time before they had found them,
and the like; holding them in a chat, till they came
to the fhip's fide; when the captain and the mate,
entering firft with their arms, immediately knocked
down the fecond mate and carpenter with the but end
of their mufquets, being very faithfully feconded by
their men; they fecured all the reds that were upon
the main and quarter-decks, and began to fasten the
hatches to keep them down who were below, when
the other boat, and their men, entering at the fore-
chains, fecured the forecaftle of the fhip, and the
fkuttle which went down into the cook-room, making
three men they found there prifoners.
When this was done, and all fafe upon the deck,
the captain ordered the mate with three men to break
into the round houfe, where the new rebel captain
lay, and, having taken the alarm, was gotten up, and
with two men and a boy had gotten fire arms in their
hands; and when the mate with a crow fplit open the
door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among
them, and wounded the mate with a mufquet ball,
which broke his arm, and wounded two more of the
men, but killed nobody.
The mate, calling for help, rushed, however, into
the round-houfe, wounded as he was, and with his
piftol fhot the new captain through the head, the
bullets entering at his mouth, and came out again
behind one of his ears; fo that he never fpoke a
word; upon which the reft yielded, and the fhip
was taken effectually, without any more lives being
loft,
.-As
Asfoon as the lip was thus fecured, the captain
ordered feven guns to be fired, which was the fignal
agreed upon with me, to give me notice of his fuc-
cefs; which you may be fure I was very glad to hear,
having fat watching upon the more for it, till near
two of the clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the fignal plainly, I laid me
down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to
me, I flept very found, till I was fomething furprifed
with the noife of a gun; and prefently flatting up, I
heard a man call me by the name of Governor, go-
vernor; and prefently I knew the captain's voice,
when climbing up to the top of the hill, there he
stood, and pointing to the fhip, he embraced me in
his arms: My dear friend and deliverer, fays he,
there's your fhip, for fhe is all your's, and fo are we,
and all that belong to her. I craft my eyes to the
fhip, and there fhe rode within a little more than
half a mile of the fhore; for they had weighed her
anchor as foon as they were mafters of her; and the
weather being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of a little creek; and the tide being
up, the captain had brought the pinnace in near the
place where I first landed my rafts, and fo landed juft
at my door.
I was, at firfl, ready to fink down with the fur-
prife: for I faw my deliverance indeed.vifibly put
into my hands, all things early, and a large fhip
just ready to carry me away whither I pleafed to
go: at firft, for fome time, I was not able to anfwer
one word; but as he had taken me in his arms,
I held faft by him, or I fhould have fallen to the
ground.
He
He perceived the furprife, and immediately pulled
a bottle out of his pocket, and gave me a dram of
cordial, which he had brought on purpofe for me:
after I drank it, I fat down upon the ground, and
though it brought me to myfelf, yet it was a good
while before I could fpeak a word to him.
All this while the poor man was in as great an ec-
ftafy as I, only not under any furprife, as I was;
and he faid a thoufand kind tender things to me, to
compofe and bring me to myfelf; but fuch was the
flood of joy in my breaft, that it put all my fpirits
into confufion; at laft it broke into tears, and in a
little while after I recovered my fpeech.
Then I took my turn, and embraced him as my
deliverer; and we rejoiced together: I told him, I
looked upon him as a man fent from Heaven to de-
liver me, and that the whole transaction feemed to
be a chain of wonders; that fuch things as thefe
were the teftimonies we had of a fecret hand of Pro-
vidence governing the world, and an evidence, that
the eyes of an infinite power could fearch into the
remotest corner of the world, and fend help to the
miferable whenever he pleafed.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulnefs to
Heaven; and what heart could forbear to blefs him,
who had not only in a miraculous manner provided
for one in fuch a wildernefs, and in fuch a defolate
condition, but from whom every deliverance muft
always be acknowledged to proceed!
When we had talked a while, the captain told me,
he had brought me fome little refrefliments, fuch as
the lip afforded, and Rich as the wretches, who had
been fo long his matters, had not plundered him of:
upon
upon this he called aloud to the boat, and bids his
men bring the things ashore that were for the gover-
nor; and indeed it was a prefent, as if I had been
one, not that I was to be carried along with them,
but as if I had been to dwell upon the ifland ftill,
and they were to go without me.
Firft, he had brought me a cafe of bottles full of
excellent cordial waters, fix large bottles of Ma-
deira wine; the bottles held two quarts a piece; two
pounds of excellent good tobacco, twelve good pieces
of the fhip's beef, and fix pieces of pork, with a bag
of peas, and about an hundred weight of bifcuit.
He brought me alfo a box of fugar, a box of flour,
a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime-juice,
and abundance of other things: but befides thefe,
and what was a thoufand times more ufeful to me,
he brought me fix clean new fhirts, fix very good
neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of fhoes, an
hat, and one pair of ftockings, and a very good fuit
of clothes of his own, which had been worn but very
little: in a word, he clothed me from head to foot.
It was a very kind and agreeable prefent, as any
one may imagine, to one in my circumftances; but
never was any thing in the world of that kind fo un-
pleafant, aukward, and uneafy, as it was to me to
wear fuch clothes at their first putting on.
After thefe ceremonies paired, and after all his good
things were brought into my little apartment, we be-
gan to confult what was to be done with the prifoners
we had; for it was worth confidering whether we
might venture to take them away with us or no, ef-
pecially two of them, whom we knew to be incorrigi-
ble and refractory to the laft degree} and the captain
faid,
faid, he knew they were fuch rogues, that there
no obliging them; and if he did carry them away,
it muft be in irons, as malefactors, to be delivered
over to juftice at the firft Englishcolony he could
come at; and I found that the captain himfelf was
very anxious about it.
Upon this, I told him, that if he deiired it, I durst undertake to bring the two men he fpoke of, to make
it their own request that he would leave them upon
the ifland: I would be very glad of that, fays the
captain, with all my heart.
Well, faid I, I will fend for them, and talk with
them for you: fo I caufed Friday and the two hos- tages, for they were now difcharged, their com-
rades having performed their promife; I fay, I caufed
them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men,
pinioned as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came.
After fome time, I came thither drefled in my new
habit, and now I was called governor again. Being
all met, and the captain with me, I caufed the men
to be brought before me, and I told them, I had had
a full account of their villainous behaviour to the
captain, and how they had run away with the ship, and were preparing to commit farther robberies; but
that Providence had enfnared them in their own ways,
and that they were fallen into the pit which they had
digged for others.
I let them know, that by my direction the fhip had
been feized, that me lay now in the road, and they
might fee by and by, that their new captain had re-
ceived the reward of his villainy; for that they might
fee him hanging at the yard-arm.
That
1*hat as to them, I wanted to know what they had
to fay, why I fhould not execute them as pirates ta-
ken in the fact, as by my commission they could not
doubt I had authority to do.
One of them anfwered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken, the captain promifed them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy: but I
told them I knew not what mercy to mew them;
for, as for myfelf, I had refolved to quit the ifland
with all my men, and had taken paffage with the.
Captain to go for England: and as for the captain, he
could not carry them to England, other than as pri-
foners in irons to be tried for mutiny, and running
away with the ship ; the confequence of which, they
muft needs know, would be the gallows; fo that I
could not tell which was beft for them, unlefs they
had a mind to take their fate in the ifland 5 if they de-
fired that, I did not care, as I had liberty to leave
it; I had fome inclination to give them their lives,
if they thought they could mift on more. They seem- ed very thankful for it; faid they would much rather
venture to ftay there, than to be carried to England
to be hanged; fo I left it on that iffue.
However, the captain feemed to make fome difficul-
ty of it, as if he durft not leave them there: upon this
I feemed to be a little angry with the captain, and
told him, that they were my prifoners, not his; and
that feeing I had offered them fo much favour,
would be as good as my word; and that if he did
not think fit to confent to it, I would fet them at
liberty as I found them; and if he did not like that,
he might take them again, if he could catch them.
Upon
Upon this they appeared very thankful, and I ac-
cordingly fet them at liberty, and bade them retire
into the woods, to the place whence they came, and
I would leave them fome fire arms, fome ammunition,
and fome directions how they fhould live very well,
if they thought fit.
Upon this, I prepared to go on board the fhip;
but told the captain, that I would Hay that night to
prepare my things; and defired him to go on board
in the mean time, and keep all right in the fhip, and
fend the boat on more the next day for me; order-
ing him in the mean time, to caufe the new captain
who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that
thefe men might fee him.
When the captain was gone, I fent for the men
up to me to my apartment, and entered ferioufly
into difcourfe with them of their circumftances: I
told them, I thought they had made a right choice;
that if the captain carried them away, they would cer-
tainly be hanged: I mewed them their captain hang-
ing at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they
had nothing lefs to expect.
When they had all declared their willingnefs to
ftay, I then told them, I would let them into the
story of my living there, and put them into the way
of making it eafy to them: accordingly I gave them
the whole hiftory of the place, and of my coming to
it; fhewed them my fortifications, the way I made
my bread, planted my corn, cured my grapes; and,
in a word, all that was neceffary to make them eafy.
I told them the story of the fixteen Spaniards that
were to be expefted; for whom I left a letter, and
made
made them promife to treat them in common with
themfelves,
I left them my fire-arms; viz. five mufquets,
three fowling-pieces, and three fwords: I had about
a barrel of powder left; for after the firft year or two
I ufed but little, and waited none: I gave them a
defcription of the way I managed the goats, and di-
rections to milk and fatten them, to make both but-
ter and cheefe.
In a word, I gave them every part of my own ftory;
and I told them, I would prevail with the captain to
leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and
fome garden-feed, which I told them I would have
been very glad of; alfo I gave them the bag of peas
which the captain had brought me to eat, and bade
them be fure to fow and increafe them.
Having done all this, I left them the next day,
and went on board the fhip: we prepared immediate-
ly to fail, but did not weigh that night: the next
morning early, two of the five men came fwimming
to the (hip's fide, and making a moft lamentable com-
plaint of the other three, begged to be taken into
the fhip, for GOD'S fake, for they would be murder-
ed; and begged the captain to take them on board
though he hanged them immediately.
Upon this the captain pretended to have no power
without me; but after fome difficulty, and after their
folemn promifes of amendment, they were taken on
board, and were fome time after foundly whipped
and pickled; after which they proved very honeft and
quiet fellows.
Some time after this, I went with the boat on
Lahore, the tide being up, with the things promifed to
the
the men, to which the captain, at my interceffion,
caufed their chefts and clothes to be added, which
they took, and were very thankful for: I alfo en-
couraged them, by telling them, that if it lay in my
way to fend a vessel to take them in, I would not
forget them.
When I took leave of this island, I carried on
board for reliques the great goat's fkin cap I had
made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; alfo I
forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned,
which had lain by me fo long ufelefs that it was
grown rufty, or tarnifhed, and could hardly pafs for
filver, till it had been a little rubbed and handled;
and alfo the money I found in the wreck of the Spa'
nifo mip.
And thus I left the ifland the nineteenth of Decem-
ber, as I found by the fhip's account, in the year
1686, after I had been upon it eight and twenty
years, two months, and nineteen days; being deli-
vered from the fecond captivity the fame day of the
month that I firft made my efcape in the Barco-hngo9
from among the Moors of Sallee.In this veflel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the eleventh of June, in the year 1687,
having been thirty and five years abfent.
When I came to England, I was a perfect ftranger
to all the world, as if I had never been known there:
my benefactor, and faithful fteward, whom I had
left in truft with my money, was alive, but had had
great misfortunes in the world, was become a widow
the fecond time, and very low in the world: I made
her eafy as to what me owed me, assuring her, I
would give her no trouble; but on the contrary, in
gratitude to her former care and faithfulnefs to me,
I relieved
I relieved her as my little ftock would afford, which
at that time would indeed allow me to do but little
for her: but I affured her, I would never forget her
former kindnefs to me; nor did I forget her, when
I had fufficient to help her; as mall be obferved in
its place. I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but my
father was dead, and my mother, and all the family
extinct; except that I found two filters, and two
of the children of one of my brothers: and as I
had been long ago given over for dead, there had
been no provifion made for me, fo that, in a word,
I found nothing to relieve or affift me; and that
little money I had, would not do fo much for me as
to fettling in the world.
I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which
I did not expect; and this was, that the mailer of
the lip, whom I had fo happily delivered, and by
the fame means faved the mip and cargo, having
given a very handfome account to the owners, of the
manner how I had faved the lives of the men, and
the ship, they invited me to meet them, and fome
other merchants concerned, and all together made
me a very handfome compliment upon that fubjeft,
and a prefent of almoft two hundred pounds after- ling.
But after making feveral reflections upon the cir-
cumftances of my life, and how little way this would
go towards fettling me in the world, I refolved to go
to Lisbon,and fee if I might not come by fome in.
formation of the ftate of my plantation in the Bra-
fits, and what was become of my partner, who, I
VOL. I. A a had
had reafon to fuppofe, had fome years now given
me over for dead.
With this view I took shipping for Lisbon,where
I arrived in April following; my man Friday ac-
companying me very honestly in all thefe ramblings,
and proving a moft faithful fervant upon all occa-
fions.
When I came to Lisbon,I found out, by enquiry,
and to my particular fatisfa&ion, my old friend, the
captain of the Ihip, who firft took me up at fea, off
the more of Africa: he was now grown old, and
had left off the fea, having put his fon, who was far
from a young man, into his fhip; and who ftill ufed
the Erafil trade. The old man did not know me,
and, indeed, I hardly knew him; but I foon brought
myfelf to his remembrance, when I told him who I
was.
After fome paffionate expreflions of our old ac-
quaintance, I inquired, you may be fure, after my
plantation, and my partner: the old man told me,
he had not been in the Brafil s for about nine years;
but that he could assure me, that when he came
away, my partner was living; but the truftees, whom
. I had joined with him, to take cognizance of my
part, were both dead; that, however, he believed
that I would have a very good account of the im-
provement of the plantation; for that, upon the
general belief of my being caft away and drowned,
my tf uftees had given in the. account of the produce
of my part of the plantation, to the . procurator
fiscal; who had appropriated it, in cafe I never
came to claim it, one third to the King, and two-
thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine,to be ex-
v pended
pended for the benefit of the poor, and for the con-
verfion of the Indians to the Catholic faith; but that
if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the in-
heritance, it would be reftored; only that the im-
provement, or annual production, being diftributed
to charitable ufes, could not be reftored; but he
assured me, that the fteward of the king's revenue
(from lands) and the provedore, or steward of the
monaftery, had taken great care all along, that the
incumbent, that is to fay, my partner, gave every
year a faithful account of the produce, of which
they received duly my moiety.
I afked him, if he knew to what height of im-
provement he had brought the plantation: and whe-
ther he thought it might be worth looking after; or
whether, on my going thither, I would meet with
no obstruction to my pofleffing my jufc right in the
moiety.
He told me, he could not tell exactly to what de-
gree the plantation was improved; but this he knew,
that my partner was growing exceeding rich upon
the enjoying but one half of it; and that, to the
bell of his remembrance, he had heard, that the king's
third of my part, which was, it feems, granted away
to fome other monaftry, or religious houfe, amounted
to above two hundred moidores a year; that, as to
my being reftored to a quiet pofleffion of it, there
was no queftion to be made of that, my partner be-
ing alive to witnefs my title, and my name being alfo
inrolled in. the register of the country. Alfo he told
me, that the furvivors of my two truftees were very
fair, honeft people, and very wealthy, and he be-
lieved I would not only have their affiftance for put-
A a 2 ting
ting me in poffeffion, but would find a very confide-
rable fum of money in their hands for my account,
being the produce of the farm, while their fathers
held the trust, and before it was given up, as above,
which, as he remembered, was about twelve years.
I mewed myfelf a little concerned and uneafy at
this account, and enquired of the old captain, how
it came to pafs, that the truftees mould thus difpofe
of my effects, when he knew that I had made my
will, and had made him, the Portuguesecaptain,
my univerfal heir, &c.
He told me, that was true; but that, as there was
no proof of my being dead, he could not act as exe-
cutor, until fome certain account would come of my
death; and that, befides he was not willing to inter-
meddle with a thing fo remote: that it was true, he
had regiftered my will, and put in his claim; and
could he have given any account of my being dead
or alive, he would have acted by procuration, and
taken pofteffion of the Ingenio (fo they called the
fugar-houfe) and had given his fon, who was now
at the Brafits, order to do it.
But, (fays the old man) I have one piece of news
to tell you, which perhaps may not be fo acceptable
to you as the reft; and that is, that believing you
were loft, and all the world believing fo alfo, your
partner and truftees did offer to account to me in
your name, for fix or eight of the first years of pro-
fit, which I received; but there being at that time,
fays he, great difburfements for increasing the works,
building an ingenio, and buying flaves, it did not
amount to near fo much as afterwards it produced:
however, fays the old man, I mail give you a true
account
account of what I have received in all, and how I
have difpofed of it.
After a few days farther conference with this an-
tient friend, he brought me an account of the fix
firft years income of my plantation, figned by my
partner, and the merchant's truftees, being always
delivered in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and fugar
in chefts, befides rum, molafles, &c. which is the
confequence of a fugar-work; and I found by this
account, that every year the income confiderably
increafed: but, as above, the difburfement being
large, the fum at firft was finall: however, the old
man let me fee, that he was debtor to me 470 moi-
dores of gold, befides 60 chefts of fugar, and 15
double rolls of tobacco, which were loft in his lip, he having been fhipwrecked coming home to Lisbon,about eleven years after my leaving the place.
The good man then began to complain of his
misfortunes, and how he had been obliged to make
ufe of my money to recover his loffes, and buy him
2. mare in a new fhip; however, my old friend, fays
he, you fhall not want a fupply in your necessity ;
and as foon as my fon returns, you shall be fully
fatisfied.
Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives
me two hundred Portugal moidores in gold; and
giving me the writings of his title to the fhip which
his fon was gone to the Brafds in, of which he was
a quarter part owner, and his fon another, he puts
them both in my hands for fecurity pf the reft.
I was too much moved with the honefty and kind-
nefs of the poor man, to be able to bear this; and
remembering what he had done for me, how he had
A a 3 taken
taken me up at fea, and how generously he had ufed
me on all occafions, and particularly how fincere a
friend he was now to me, I could hardly refrain
weeping at what he faid to me: Therefore, first I
asked him if his circumftances admitted him to fpare
fo much money at that time, and if it would not
ftraiten him? He told me he could not fay but it
might ftraiten him a little; but, however, it was my
money, and I might want it more than he.
Every thing the good man faid was full of affec-
tion, and I could hardly refrain from tears while he
fpoke. In most, I took one hundred of the moi-
dorcs, and called for a pen and ink to give him a
receipt for them; then I returned him the rest, and
told him, if ever I had pofleffion of the plantation,
I would return the other to him alfo, as indeed I
afterwards did; and that, as to the bill of fale of his
part in his fon's fhip, I would not take it by any
means; but that if I wanted the money, I found he
was honeft enough to pay me; and if I did not,
but came to receive what he gave me reafon to ex-
pect, I would never have a penny more from him.
When this was paired, the old man began to ask me if he would put me in a method to make my
claim to my plantation. I told him, I thought to
go over to it myself. He faid, I might do fo if I
pleafed; but that if I did not, there were ways
enough to fecure my right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the profits to my ufe; and as there were
fhips in the river of Lisbon,just ready to go away
to Brad,he made me enter my name in a public
regifter, with his affidavit, affirming upon oath that
I was alive, and that I was the fame perfon who
took
took up. the land for the planting the faid plantation
at first. This being regularly attefted by a notary, and a
procuration affixed, he directed me to fend it with a
letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaint-
ance at the place; and then propofed my staying with him till an account came of the return.
Never any thing was more honourable than the
proceedings upon this procuration; for in lefs than
feven months I received a large packet from the fur-
vivors of my truftees, the merchants, on whofe ac-
count I went to fea, in which were the following par-
ticular letters and papers inclofed.
First, There was the account current of the pro-
duce of my farm, or plantation, from the year when
their fathers had balanced with my old Portugal cap-
tain, being for tax years; the balance appeared to
be 1174 moidores in my favour.
Secondly, There was the account of four years
more while they kept the effects in their hands, be-
fore the government claimed the adminiftration, as
being the effects of a perfon not to be found, which
they call Civil Death; and the balance of this, the
value of the plantation increafing, amounted to crui-
fadoes, which made 3241 moidores.
Thirdly, There was the prior of the Auguftines
account, who had received the profits for above four-
teen years; but not being able to account for what
was difpofed to the hofpital, very honeftly declared
he had 872 moidores not distributed, which he ac-
knowledged to my account. As to the king's part,
that refunded nothing.
A a 4 There
There was alfo a letter of my partner's, congra-
tulating me very affectionately upon my being alive;
giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year, with a particular of
the number of fquares, or acres, that it contained;
how planted, how many flaves there were upon it;
and, making two and twenty crofles for blessings, told me he had faid fo many Ave Maria's to thank
the BlessedVirgin that I was alive; inviting me very
paffionately to come over and take poffemon of my
own, and in the mean time to give him orders to
whom he would deliver my effects, if I did not come
myfelf; concluding with an hearty tender of his
friendfhip, and that of his family; and fent me, as
a prefent, feven fine leopards skins, which he had, it
seems, received from Africa by fome other lip which
he had fent thither, and who, it feems, had made a
better voyage than I. He fent me alfo five chefts of
excellent fweetmeats, and an hundred pieces of gold
uncoined, not quite fo large as moidores.
By the fame fleet my merchant-truftees fhipped
me 1200 chefts of fugar, 800 rolls of tobacco, and
the reft of the whole account in gold.
I might well fay now, indeed, that the latter end
of Job was better than the beginning: It is impoffi-
ble to exprefs the flutterings of my very heart, when
I looked over thefe letters, and especially when I
found all my wealth about me; for as the Braftt
fhips come all in fleets, the fame lips which brought
my letters brought my goods; and the effects were
fafe in the Tagus before the letter came to my hand:
In a word, I turned pale, and grew fick; and had
not
not the old man ran and fetched me a cordial, I be-
lieve the fudden furprife of joy had overfet nature,
and I had died upon the fpot.
Nay, after that, I continued very ill, and was fo
fome hours, till a phyfician being fent for, and forms thing of the real caufe of my illnefs being known,
he ordered me to be let blood, after which I had re-
lief, and grew well; but I verily believe, if it had
not been eafed by the vent given in that manner to
the fpirits, I would have died.
I was now mafter all on a fudden, of above 50,000!.
fterling in money, and had an estate, as I might
well call it, in the Bra/ils, of above a thoufand
pounds a year, as fure as an estate of lands in Eng-
land; and, in a word, I was in a condition which
I fcarce knew how to underftand, or how to compofe
myfelf for the enjoyment of.
The firft thing I did was to recompenfe my ori-
ginal benefactor, my good old captain, who had
been firft charitable to me in my diftrefs, kind to me
in the beginning, and honeft to me at the end: I
fhewed him all that was fent me; I told him that,
next to the providence of heaven, which difpofes
all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay
on me to reward him, which I would do an hundred
fold: So I firft returned to him the hundred moi-
dores I had received of him; then I fent for a notary,
and caufed him to draw up a general releafe or dif-
charge for the 470 moidores, which he had acknow-
ledged he owed me, in the fullest and firmest manner
possible ; after which I caufed a procuration to be
drawn, empowering him to be my receiver of the
annual profits of my plantation, and appointing my
partner
partner to account to him, and make the returns by
the ufual fleets to him in my name; and a claufe in
the end, being a grant of 100 moidores a year to
him during his life, out of the effects; and 50 moi-
dores a year to his fon after him, for his life: And
thus I requited my old man.
I was now to .confider which way to steer my
courfe next, and what to do with the eftate that
Providence had thus put into my hands; and, in-
deed, I had more care upon my head now than I
had-in my filent ftate of life in the ifland, where I
wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing
but what I wanted; whereas I had now a great
charge upon me, and my business was how to secure it: I had never a cave to hide my money in, or a place
where it might lie without lock or key, till it grew
mouldy and tarnifhed before any body would med-
dle with it: On the contrary, I knew not where to put
it, or whom to trust with it; my old patron, the cap-
tain, indeed, was honest, and that was the only re-
fuge I had.
In the next place, my interest in the Brqfits feemed
to fummon me thither; but now I could not tell
how to think of going thither till, I had fettled my
affairs, and left my affects in fome fafe hands behind
me. At first I thought of my old friend the widow,
who, I knew, was honest, and would be just to me;
but then fhe was in years, and but poor, and, for
aught I knew, might be in debt; fo that, in a word,
I had no way but to go back to England myfelf, and
take my effects with me.
I was fome months, however, before I refolved
upon this; and therefore as I had rewarded the old
captain
captain fully, and to fatisfaction, who had been my
former benefactor, fo I began to think of my poor
widow, whofe husband had been my first benefactor,
and Ihe, while it was in her power, my faithful stew- ard and instructor : So the firft thing I did, I got a
merchant in Lisbonto write to his correfpondent in
London, not only to pay a bill, but to go find her
out, and carry her in money an hundred pounds from
me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her
poverty, by telling her me mould, if I lived, have a
farther fupply: At the fame time I fent my two
filters in the country, each of them an hundred
pounds, they being, though not in want, yet not in
very good circumftances; one having been married,
and left a widow; and the other having an hufband
not fo kind to her as he would be.
But among all my relations or acquaintances, I
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst com-
mit the grofs of my neck, that I might go away to
the Brafils, and leave things fafe behind me; and
this greatly perplexed me.
I had once a mind to have gone to the Brafils,
and have fettled myfelf there, for I was, as it were,
naturalized to the place; but I had fome little fcru-
ple in my mind about religion,. which infenfibly
drew me back, of which I mall fay more prefently.
However, it was not religion that kept me from go-
ing thither for the prefent; and as I had made no
fcruple of being openly of the religion of the coun-
try, all the while I was among them, fo neither did
I yet; only that now and then having of late thought
more of it than formerly, when I began to think
of
of living and dying among them, I began to regret
my having profefled myfelf a Papift, and thought it
might not be the belt religion to die in.
But, as I have faid, this was not the main thing
that kept me from going to the Brajtis, but that really
I did not know with whom to leave my effects behind
me; fo I refolved at laft to go to England with
them, where, if I arrived, I concluded I fhould make
fome acquaintance, or find fome relations, that would
be faithful to me; and accordingly I prepared to go
for England with all my wealth.
In order to prepare things for my going home, I
first, (the Braftl fleet being juft going away) refolved
to give anfwers fuitable to the just and faithful ac-
count of things I had from thence; and firft to the
prior of St. Augustine,I wrote a letter full of thanks
for his juft dealings, and the offer of the 872 moi-
dores, which was undifpofed of, which I defired might
be given; 500 to the monaftry; and 372 to the poor,
as the prior mould direct, desiring the good Padre's
prayers for me, and the like.
I wrote next a letter of thanks to my two truftees,
with all the acknowledgment that fo much justice and honesty called for; as for fending them any
prefent, they were far above having any occafion
of it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his
induftry in the improving the plantation, and his in-
tegrity in increasing the ftock of the works, giving
him inftructions for his future government of my
part according to the powers I had left with my old
patrcn, to whom I defired him to fend whatever be-
came
Came due to me, till he should hear from me more
particularly: afluring him, that it was my intention,
not only to come to him, but to fettle myfelf there
for the remainder of my life. To this I added a very
handfome prefent of fome Italian filks for his wife
and two daughters, for fuch the captain's fon in-
formed me he had; with two pieces of fine Englishbroadcloth, the beft I could get in Lisbon,five
pieces of black bays, and fome Flanders lace of a good
value.
Having thus fettled my affairs, fold my cargo, and
turned all my effects into good bills of exchange,
my next difficulty was, which way to go to England:
I had been accuftomed enough to the fea, and yet I
had a flrange averfion to go to England by fea at
that time; and though I could give no reafon for it,
yet the difficulty increafed upon me fo much, that
though I had once fhipped my baggage in order to
go, yet I altered my mind, and that not once, but
two or three times.
It is true, I had been very unfortunate by fea, and
this might be one of the reafons: But let no man
flight the strong impulfes of his own thoughts in
cafes of fuch moment. Two of the lips which I
had fingled out to go in, I mean more particularly
fingled out than any other, that is to fay, fo as in one
of them to put my things on board, and in the other
to have agreed with the captain; I fay, two of thefe
fliips mifcarried, viz, one was taken by the Atge-
rines, and the other was caft away on the Start, near
Torbay, and all the people drowned except three;
fo
fo that in either of those vessels I had been made mi-
ferable, and in which most, it was hard to fay.
Having being thus harrafied in my thoughts, my
old pilot, to whom I communicated every thing,
prefled me earneftly not to go to fea; but either to
go by land to the Groyne, and crofs over the Bay of
Biscayto Rochelle, from whence it was but an eafy
and fafe journey by land to Paris, and fo to Calais and
Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and fo all the way
by land through France.
In a word, I was fo prepoflefied againft my going
by lea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I re- folved to travel all the way by land; which, as I was
not in haste, and did 'not value the charge, was by
much the pleafanter way; and to make it more fo,
my old captain brought an Englishgentleman, the
fon of a merchant in Lisbon,who was willing to
travel with me; after which, we picked up two who
were English,and merchants alfo, and two young
Portuguesegentlemen, the laft going to Paris only;
fo that we were in all fix of us, and five fervants,
the two merchants, and the two Portuguese,con-
tenting themfelves with one fervant between two, to
fave the charge; and as for me I got an Englijh
failor to travel with me as a fervant, besides my man
Friday,who was too much a ftranger to be capable
of fupplying the place of a servant upon the road.
In this manner I fet out for Lisbon: and our com-
pany being all very well mounted and armed, we
made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour
to call me captain, as well becaufe I was the oldeft
man,
man, as becaufe I had two fervants, and indeed was
the original of the whole journey.
As I have troubled you with none of my fea jour-
nals, fo mall I trouble you with none of my land
journals: But fome adventures that happened to us in
this tedious and difficult journey, I muft not omit.
When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us
ftrangers to Spain, were willing to stay fome time to
fee the court of Spain, and to fee what was worth
obferving; but it being the latter part of the fum-
mer, we haftened away, and fet out from Madrid
about the midftle of QElober: But when we came to
the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed at feveral
towns on the way, with an account that fo much
fnow was fallen on the French fide of the mountains,
that feveral travellers were obliged to come back to
Pampeluna, after having attempted, at an extreme
hazard, to pafs on.
When we came to Pampeluna itfelf, we found it
fo indeed; and to me that had been always ufed to
an hot climate, and indeed to countries where we
could fcarce bear any clothes on, the cold was in fufferable; nor, indeed, was it more painful than it
was furprifmg, to come but ten days before out of
the Old Caftile, where the weather was not only warm,
but very hot, and immediately to feel a wind from
the Pyrenean mountains, fo very keen, fo feverely
cold, as to be intolerable, and to endanger benumb-
ing and perifhing of our fingers and toes, was very
ftrange.
Poor Friday was really frighted when he faw the
mountains all covered with fnow, and felt cold wea-
ther,
ther, which he had never feen or felt before in his
life.
To mend the matter, after we came to Pampetuna,
it continued mowing with fo much violence, and fo
long, that the people faid, winter was come before
its time; and the roads, which were difficult before,
were now quite impaflable: in a word, the fnow lay
in fome places too thick for us to travel; and being
not hard frozen, as is the cafe in northern countries,
there was no going without being in danger of being
buried alive every ftep. We laid no lefs than twenty
days at Pampeluna; when (feeing the winter coming
on, and no likelihood of its being better, for it was
the fevereft winter all over Europe that had been
known in many years) I propofed that we would all
go away to Fontarabia, and there take mapping for
Bourdeanx, which was a very little voyage.
But while we were confidering this, there came in
four French gentlemen, who, having been ftopped
on the French fide of the pages, as we were on the
Spanish,had found out a guide, who traverfing the
country near the head of Languedoc, had brought
them over the mountains by fuch ways, that they
were not much incommoded with the fnow; and
where they met with fnow in any quantity, they faid
it was frozen hard enough to bear them and their
horfes.
We fent for this guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carry us the fame way, with no hazard
from the fnow, provided we were armed fufficiently
to protect us from wild beasts ; for he faid, upon
thefe great mows, it was frequent for fome
wolves
•Wolves to mew themfelves at the foot of the moun-
tains, being made ravenous for want of food, the
ground being covered with fnow. We told him we
were well enough prepared for fuch creatures as they
were, if he-would infure us from a kind of two-
legged wolves, which we were told we were in moft
danger from, efpecially on the French fide of the
mountains.
He fatisfied us there was no danger of that kind
in the way that we were to go: fo we readily agreed
to follow him: as did alfo twelve other gentlemen,
with their fervants, fome French, fome Spanijh, who,
as I faid, had attempted to go, and were obliged to
come back again.
Accordingly we all fet out from Pampetuna, with
our guide, on the fifteenth of November; and in-
deed, I was furprifed, when, instead of going for-
ward, he came directly back with us, on the fame
road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
miles 5 when having paired two rivers, and come
into the plain country, we found ourfelves in a warm
climate again, where the country was pleafant, and
no fnow to be feen; but on a fudden, turning to the
left, he approached the mountains another way; and
though it is true, the hills and the precipices looked
dreadfully, yet he made fo many tours, fuch meanders,
and led us by fuch winding ways, we infenfibly paired the height of the mountains, without being much
incumbered with the fnow; and all on a fudden he
fhewed us the pleafant fruitful provinces of Langue-
doc and Gafcoigne, all green and flourishing j though
VOL. I. 'Bb indeed
indeed they were at a great diftance, and we had
fome rough way to pafs yet.
We were a little uneafy however, when we found
it fnowed one whole day and a night, fo faft, that we
could not travel; but he bid us be eafy, we fhould
foon be paft it all: we found, indeed, that we began
to defcend every day, and to come more north than
before; and fo, depending upon our guide, we went
on.
It was about two hours before night, when our
guide being fomething before us, and not just in
fight, out rufhed three monftrous wolves, and after
them a bear, out of an hollow way, adjoining to a
thick wood; two of the wolves flew upon the guide,
and had he been half a mile before us, he had been
devoured indeed, before we could have helped him;
one of them faftened upon his horfe, and the other at-
tacked the man with that violence, that he had not
time, or not prefence of mind enough, to draw his
pistol, but hallooed and cried out to us moft luftily;
my man Friday being next to me, I bid him ride up,
and fee what was the matter: As foon as Friday
came in fight of the man, he hallooed, as loud as
the other, O mafter! O master ! But, like a bold
fellow, rode directly up to the man, and with his
pistol mot the wolf that attacked him in the head.
It was happy for the poor man that it was my man
Friday; for he, having been ufed to that kind of
creature in his country, had no fear upon him, but
went clofe up to him, and met him as above; where-
as any of us would have fired at a farther diftance,
and have perhaps either miffed the wolf, or endan-
gered meeting the man.
But
But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man
than I, and indeed it alarmed all our company, when,
with the noife of Friday's pistol, we heard on both
fides the difinalleft howlings of wolves, and the noife
Redoubled by the echo of the mountains, that it was
to us as if there had been a prodigious multitude of
them; and perhaps indeed there was not fuch a few,
as that we had no caufe of apprehenfions.
However, as Friday had killed this wolf, the
other, that had faftened upon the horfe, left him ins mediately, and fled, having happily fastened upon
his head, where the boffes of the bridle had ftuck in
his teeth, fo that he had not done him much hurt:
the man, indeed, was moft hurt; for the raging crea-
ture had bit him twice, once on the arm, and the
other time a little above his knee; and he was juft
as it were tumbling down by the diforder of the
horfe, when Friday came up, and met the wolf.
It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the noife of Friday'spistol we all mended our, pace, and rid up as faft as
the way (which was very difficult) would give us .
leave, to fee what was the matter; as foon as we
came clear of the trees, which blinded us before, we
faw plainly what had been the cafe, and how Friday
had difengaged the poor guide; though we did not
prefently difcern what kind of creature it was he had
killed.
But never was a fight managed fo hardily, and in
fuch a furprifing manner, as that which followed be-
tween Friday and the bear, which gave us all (though
at firft we were furprifed and afraid for him) the
greatest diversion imaginable; as the bear is an
heavy, clumfy creature, and does not gallop as the
B b 2 wolf
wolf does, which is fwift and light; fo he has two
particular qualities, which generally are the rule of
his actions; firft, as to men, who are not his proper
prey, I fay not his proper prey, becaufe though I can't
fay what excessive hunger might do, which was now
their cafe, the ground being all covered with fnow;
yet as to men, he does not ufually attempt them, un-
lefs they firft attack him; on the contrary, if you
meet him in the woods, if you don't meddle with
him, he won't meddle with you; yet then you muft
take care to be very civil to him, and give him the
road; for he is a very nice gentleman, he won't go
a ftep out of the way for a prince; nay, if you are
really afraid, your belt way is to look another way,
and keep going on; for fometimes, if you ftop, and
ftand ftill, and look ftedfaftly at him, he takes it for
an affront; and if you throw or tofs any thing at him,
and it hits him, though it were but a bit of flick as
big as your finger, he takes it for an affront, and fets
all other bufmels afide to purfue his revenge; for he
will have fatisfadHon in point of honour, and this
is his first quality; the next is, that if he be once
affronted, he will never leave you, night or day,
till he has his revenge, but follow at a good round
rate till he overtakes you.
My man Friday had delivered our guide, and
when we came up to him, he was helping him off
from his horfe; for the man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the first ;
when, on a fudden, we efpied the bear come out of
the wood, and a very monftrous one it was, the
biggeft by far that ever I faw: we were all a little
furprifed
furprifed when we faw him; but when Friday faw
him, it was eafy to fee joy and courage in the fellow's
countenance: O! O! O! fays Friday, three times,
pointing to him, O mafter! you give me te leave, me
fhakee te hand with him, me makee you good laugh.
I was furprifed to fee the fellow fo pleafed: You
fool you, faid I, he will eat you up. Eatee me up!
eatee me up! fays Friday, twice over again; me
eatee him up; me make you good laugh; you all
ftay here, me mew you good laugh: fo down he
fits, and gets his boots off in a moment, and put on
a pair of pumps (as we call the flat shoes they wear)
and which he had in his pocket, and gives my other
fervant his horfe, and, with his gun, away he flew,
fwift like the wind.
The bear was walking foftly on, and offered to
meddle with nobody, till Friday coming pretty near,
calls to him, as if the bear could underftand him:
Hark ye, hark ye, fays Friday, me fpeakee wit you.
We followed at a diftance; for now being come
down to the Gafcoigne fide of the mountains, we
were entered a vaft great forest, where the country
was plain, and pretty open, though many trees in it
scattered here and there.
Friday, who had, as we fay, the heels of the bear,
came up with him quickly, and takes up a great
stone, and throws at him, and hit him just on the
head; but did him no more harm than if hehad thrown
it againft a wall; but it anfwered Friday's end; for
the rogue was fo void of fear, that he did it purely
to make the bear follow him, and shew us fome laugh,
as he called it.
Bb 3 As
L...
As foon as the bear felt the ftone, and faw him, he
turns about, and comes after him, taking devilifh
long ftrides, and shuffling along at a ftrange rate, fa
as he would put an horfe to a middling gallop; away
runs Friday, and takes his courfe, as if he ran to-
wards us for help; fo we all refolved to fire at once
upon the bear, and deliver my man; though I was
angry at him heartily for bringing the bear back
upon us, when he was going about his own bufinefs.
another way; and efpecially I was angry that he had
turned the bear upon us, and then run away; and I
called out, You dog, faid I, is this your making us
laugh? Come away, and take your horfe, that we
may meet the creature. He hears me, and cries out,
No moot, no moot, ftand flill, you get much laugh;
and as the nimble creature ran two feet for the beaft's
one, he turned on a fudden, on one fide of us, and
feeing a great oak tree, fit for his purpofe, he bec-
koned us to follow, and doubling his pace, he gets
nimbly up the tree, laying his gun down upon the
ground, at about five or fix yards from the bottom
of the tree.
The bear foon came to the tree, and we followed
at a distance ; the firft thing he did, he flopped at the
gun, smelt to it, but let it lie, and up he fcrambles
into the tree, climbing like a cat, though fo mon-
ftrous heavy: I was amazed at the folly, as I thought
it, of my man, and could not for my life fee any
thing to laugh at yet, till feeing the bear get up the
tree, we all rode nearer to him.
When we came to the tree, there was Friday got
out to the fmall of a large limb of the tree, and the
bear
V
bear got about half way to him; as foon as the bear
got out to that part where the limb of the tree was
weaker, Ha, fays he to us, now you fee me teachee
the bear dance; fo he falls a jumping, and fhaking
the bough, at which the bear began to totter, but
ftood ftill, and began to look behind him, to fee how
he would get back; then indeed we did laugh hearti-
ly: But Friday had not done with him by a great
deal; when he fees him ftand ftill, he calls out to
him again, as if he had fuppofed the bear could fpeak
English,What, you come no farther? Pray you come
farther. So he left jumping and making the
bough; and the bear, juft as if he underftood what
hefaid, did come a little farther; then he fell a jump-
ing again, and the bear stopped again.
We thought now was a good time to knock him
on the head, and called to Friday to ftand ftill, and
we would fhoot the bear; but he cried out earneft-
ly, O pray! O pray! no shoot, me fhoot by and
then; he would have faid, by and bye. However,
to fhorten the ftory, Friday danced fo much, and
the bear ftood fo ticklish, that we had laughing
enough indeed, but Bill could not imagine what the
fellow would do; for firft we thought he depended
upon fhaking the bear off; and we found the bear
was too cunning for that too; for he would not
get out far enough to be thrown down, but clings
faft with his great broad claws and feet, fo that we
could not imagine what would be the end of it, and
where the jeft would be at laft.
But Friday put us out of doubt quickly; for
feeing the bear cling faft to the bough, and that he
B b 4 would
would not be perfuaded to come any farther; Well,
well, faid Friday, you no come farther, me go, me
go; you no come to me, me come to you; and upon
this he goes out to the finalleft end of the bough,
where it would bend with his weight, and gently lets
himfelf down by it, Riding down the bough, till he
came near enough to jump down on his feet, and
away he ran to his gun, takes it up, and flands
ftill.
Well, faid I to him, Friday, what will you do
now? Why don't you fhoot him? No fhoot, fays
Friday, no yet, me fhoot now me no kill; me stay, give you one more laugh; and indeed fo he did, as
you will fee prefently; for when the bear faw his
enemy gone, he comes back from the bough where
he stood, but did it mighty leifurely, looking behind
him every flep, and coming backward till he got into
the body of the tree; then with the fame hinder end
foremost, he came down the tree, grafping it with
his claws, and moving one foot at a time, very lei-
furely; at this juncture, and just before he could fet
his hind feet upon the ground, Friday ftepped clofe
to him, clapped the muzzle of his piece into his ear,
and met him as dead as a stone. Then the rogue turned about, to fee if we did not
laugh; and when he faw we were pleafed by our
looks, he falls a laughing himfelf very loud; So we
kill bear in my country, fays, Friday. So, you kill
them, faid I; why you have no guns: No, fays he,
no guns, but fhoot great much long arrow.
This was, indeed, a good diverfion to us; but we
were ftill in a wild place, and our guide very much
hurt,
hurt, and what to do we hardly knew; the howling
of wolves ran much in my head; and indeed ex-
cept the noise I once heard on the more of Africa,
of which I have faid fomething already, I never
heard any thing that filled me with fo much hor-
ror.
Thefe things, and the approach of night, called
us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us, we
should certainly have taken the fkin of this mon-
ftrous creature off, which was worth faving; but
we had three leagues to go, and our guide hastened us; fo we left him, and went forward on our jour-
ney.
The ground was full covered with fnow, though
not fo deep and dangerous as on the mountains; and
the ravenous creatures, as we heard afterwards, were
come down into the foreft and plain country, preffed
by hunger, to feel; for food, and had done a great
deal of mifchief in the villages, where they fur-
prifed the country people, killed a great many of their
fheep and horfes, and fome people too.
We had one dangerous place to pafs, of which
our guide told us, if there were any more wolves in
the country, we would find them there; and this
was a finall plain, furrounded with woods on every
fide, and a long narrow defile or lane, which we
were to pafs to get through the wood, and then we
would come to the village where we were to lodge.
It was within half an hour of fun-fet when we
entered the fire wood; and a little after fun-fet,
when we came into the plain. We met with no-
thing in the first wood, except that in a little plain
within
within the wood, which was not above two furlongs
over, we faw five great wolves crofs the road, full
fpeed one after another, as if they had been in chafe
of fome prey, and had it in view; they took no no-
tice of us, and were gone and out of fight in a few
moments.
Opon this our guide, who, by the way, was a
wretched faint-hearted fellow, bade us keep in a rea-
dy pofture; for he believed there were more wolves
a coming.
We kept our arms ready, and our eyes about us;
but we faw no more wolves till we came through that
wood, which was near half a league, and entered
the plain; as foon as we came into the plain, we had
occafion enough to look about us. The first object
we met with was a dead horfe, that is to fay, a poor
horfe which the wolves had killed, and at leaft a do-
zen of them at work; we could not fay eating of
him, but picking of his bones rather; for they had
eaten up all the flesh before.
We did not think fit to disturb them at their feast, neither did they take much notice of us; Friday
would have let fly at them, but I would not fuffer
him by any means; for I found we were like to
have more bufmefs upon our hands than we were
aware of. We were not half gone over the plain,
but we began to hear the wolves howl in the woods,
on our left, in a frightful manner; and prefently af-
ter we faw about an hundred coming on directly to-
wards us, all in a body, and moft of them in a line,
as regularly as an army drawn up by experienced
officers. I fcarce knew in what manner to receive
themj
them; but found to draw ourfelves in a clofe line,
was the only way; fo we formed in a moment; but,
that we might not have too much interval, I or-
dered, that only every other man should fire; and
that the others, who had not fired, should stand ready
to give them a fecond volley immediately, if they con-
tinued to advance upon us; and that then thofe who
had fired at first, would not pretend to load their fu-
fils again, but ftand ready, with every one a piftol,
for we were all armed with a fufil, and a pair of pif-
tols each man; fo we were, by this method, able to
fire fix volleys, half of us at a time; however, at
prefent we had no necessity ; for, upon firing the first volley, the enemy made a full stop, being terrified,
as well with the noife as with the fire; four of them,
being fhot in the head, dropped; feveral others were
wounded, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by
the fnow: I found they ftopped, but did not immedi-
ately retreat; whereupon remembering that I had
been told, that the fierceft creatures were terrified
at the voice of a man, I caufed all our company to
halloo as loud as we could, and I found the notion
not altogether miftaken; for upon our fhout, they
began to retire, and turn about; then I ordered a
fecond volley to be fired in their rear, which put
them to the gallop, and away they went to the woods.
This gave us leifure to charge our pieces again,
and that we might lofe no time, we kept doing; but
we had but little more than loaded our fufils, and
put ourfelves into a readinefs, when we heard a ter-
rible noife in the fame wood, on our left; only that
it was farther onward the fame way we were to go.
The
The night was coming on, and the night began to
be dusky, which made it the worfe on our fide;
but, the noife increasing, we could eafily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of thofe hellifh
creatures; and, on a fudden, we perceived two or
three troops of wolves on our left, one behind us,
and one on our front, fo that we feemed to be fur-
rounded with them; however, as they did not fall
upon us, we kept our way forward, as faft as we
could make our horfes go, which, the way being
very rough, was only a good large trot; and in
this manner we only came in view of the entrance
of the wood through which we were to pafs,. at
the farther fide of the plain; but we were greatly
furprifed, when, coming near the lane, or pafs, we *
faw a confufed number of wolves standing just at
the entrance.
On a fudden, at another opening of the wood,
we heard the noife of a gun; and, looking that
way, out rushed an horfe, with a faddle and a
bridle on him, flying like the wind, and fixteen or
feventeen wolves after him full fpeed: indeed the
horfe had the heels of them; but as we fuppofe
that he could not hold it at that rate, we doubted
not but they would get up with him at laft; and
no queftion but they did.
Here we had a moft horrible fight; for, riding
up to the entrance where the horfe came out, we
found the carcafe of another horfe, and of two men
devoured by thefe ravenous creatures, and of one
the man was no doubt the fame whom we heard
fire a gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off;
but
but as to the man, his head, and the upper part of
his body, were eaten up.
This filled us with horror, and we knew not
what courfe to take; but the creatures refolved us
foon, for they gathered about us presently in hopes
of prey; and I verily believe there were three hun-
dred of them: It happened very much to our advan-
tage, that at the entrance into the wood, but a little
way from it, there lay fome large timber trees, which
had been cut down the fummer before, and I fup-
pofe lay there for carriage; I drew my little troop in
among thefe trees, and placing ourfelves in a line
behind one long tree, I advifed them all to alight,
and, keeping that tree before us, for a breaft-work,
to ftand in a triangle, or three fronts, inclofmg our
horfes in the centre.
We did fo, and it was well we did; for never was
a more furious charge than the creatures made upon
us in this place; they came on us with a growling
kind of a noife, and mounted the piece of timber
(which, as I faid, was our breaft-work,) as if they
were only rufhing upon their prey; and this fury of
theirs, it feems, was principally occasioned by their
feeing our horfes behind us, which was the prey they
aimed at: I ordered our men to fire as before, every
man; and they took their aim fo fure, that indeed
they killed feveral of the wolves at the first volley;
but there was a neceffity to keep a continual firing,
for they came on like devils, thofe behind pufhing on
thofe before.
When we had fired our fecond volley of fuels, we thought they ftopped a little, and I hoped they
would have gone off, but it was but a moment,
for
r
for others came. forward again; fo we fired oul"
volleys of piftols; and I believe in thefe four firings, we killed feventeen or eighteen of them,
and lamed twice as many; yet they came on again.
I was loth to fpend our raft fhot too haftily; fo
I called my fervant, not my man Friday', for he was
better employed; for, with the greateft dexterity
imaginable, he charged my fufil and his own, while
we were engaged; but, as I faid, I called my other
man ; and giving him a horn of powder, I bade him
lay a train all along the piece of timber, and let it be
a large train; he did fo, and had but time to get
away, when the wolves came up to it, and fome were
got up upon it; when I, snapping an uncharged piftol
clofe to the powder, fet it on fire; and thofe that
were upon the timber were fcorched with it, and fix
or feven of them fell, or rather jumped in among
us, with the force and fright of the fire; we dif-
patched thefe in an inftant, and the left were' fo
frighted with the light, which the night, for now it
was very near dark, made more terrible, that they
drew back a little.
Upon, which I ordered our laft piftols to be fired
off in one volley, and after that we gave a fhout;
upon this the wolves turned tail, and we fallied imme-
diately upon near twenty lame ones, which we found
ftruggling on the ground, and fell a cutting them with
our fwords, which anfwered our expectation; for
the crying and howling they made were better un-
iderftood by their fellows; fo that they fled and left
us.
We had, first and laft, killed about three fcore of
them 5 and had it been day-light, we had killed
many
many more: The field of battle being thus cleared,
•we made forward again; for we had ftill near a
league to go; we heard the ravenous creatures howl
and yell in the woods as we went, feveral times; and
fometimes we fancied we faw fome of them, but the
fnow dazzling our eyes, we were not certain; fo in
about an hour more we came to the town, where we
were to lodge, which we found in a terrible fright,
and all in arms j for, it feems, that, the night be-
fore, the wolves and fome bears had broken into that
village, and put them in a terrible fright; and they
were obliged to keep guard night and day, but efpe-
cially in the night, to preferve their cattle, and in-
deed their people.
The next morning our guide was fo ill, and his
limbs fo fwelled with the rankling of his two
wounds, that he could go no farther; fo we were
obliged to take a new guide there, and go to Toloufe, where we found a warm climate, a fruitful,
pleafant country, and no fnow, no wolves, or any
thing like them; but when we told our story at
Tholoufe, they told us it was nothing but what was
ordinary in the great foreft at the foot of the moun-
tains, efpecially when the fnow lay on the ground;
but they enquired much what kind of a guide we
had gotten, that would venture to bring us that
way in fuch a fevere feafon; and told us, it was very
much we were not all devoured: When we told
them how we placed ourfelves, and the horfes in the
middle, they blamed us exceedingly, and told us it
was fifty to one but we had been all deftroyed; for
it was the fight of the horfes that made the wolves
fo furious, feeing their prey; and that at other times
they
they are really afraid of a gun; but they being ex ceffive hungry, and raging on that account, the ea-
gernefs to come at the horses had made them fenfe-
lefs of danger; and that if we had not by the con-
tinued fire, and at laft by the ftratagem of the train
of powder, maftered them, it had been great odds
but that we had been torn to pieces; whereas, had
we been content to have fat ftill on horfeback, and
fired as horfemen, they would not have taken the
horfes fo much for their own, when men were on
their backs, as otherwife; and withal they told us,
that at laft, if we had ftood altogether, and left our
horfes, they would have been fo eager to have de-
voured them, that we might have come off fafe,
efpecially having our fire-arms in our hands, and
being fo many in number.
For my part, I was never fo fenfible of danger in
my life; for feeing above three hundred devils come
roaring and open-mouthed to devour us, and having
nothing to fhelter us, or retreat to, I gave myfelf
over for loft; and as it was, I believe, I mail never
care to crofs thofe mountains again; I think I would
much rather go a thoufand leagues by fea, though
I were fure to meet with a ftorm once a week.
I have nothing uncommon to take notice of in
my paflagethrough France; nothing but what other
travellers have given an account of, with much more
advantage than I can: I travelled from Tholoufe to
Paris, and without any conuderable ftay, came to
Calais, and landed fafe at Dover, the fourteenth of
January, after having had a fevere cold feafon to
travel in.
I was
I was now come to the centre of my travels, and
had in a little time all my new difcovered eftate fate
about me, the bills of exchange, which I brought
with me, having been very currently paid.
My principal guide and privy counfellor, was my
good ancient widow, who, in gratitude for the money
I had fent her, thought no pains too much, or care
too great, to employ for me; and I trufted her fo
entirely with every thing, that I was perfectly eafy
as to the fecurity of my effects; and indeed I was
very happy from my beginning, and now to the end,
in the unfpotted integrity of this good gentlewoman.
And now I 'began to think of leaving my effects
with this woman, and fetting out for Lisbon,and fo
to the Brafds: but now another fcruple came in the
way, and that was religion; fo: as I had entertained
fome doubts about the Roman religion, even while I
was abroad, efpecially in my ftate of folitude; fo I
knew there was no going to the Brafils for me, much
lefs going to settle there, unlefs I refolved to embrace
the RomanCatholic religion, without any referve;
except on the other hand I refolved to be a facrifice
to my principles, be a martyr for religion, and die
in the inquifuion: fo I refolved to ftay at home, and,
if I could find means for it, to difpofe of my planta-
tion.
To this purpofe I wrote to my old friend at Lisbon,who in return gave me notice, that he could eafily
difpofe of it there: but that if I thought fit to give
him leave to offer it in my name to the two merchants,
the furvivors of my trufcees who lived in the Brafils,
who must fully underftand the value of it, who lived

just upon the fpot, and who I knew to be very rich,
fo that he believed they would be fond of buying it»
he did not doubt, but I fhouldmake 4 or 5000 pieces
of eight the more of it.
Accordingly I agreed, gave him orders to offer it
to them, and he did fo; and in about eight months
more, the fhip being then returned, he fent me an
account, that they had accepted the offer, and had
remitted 33,000 pieces of eight to a correfpondent of
theirs at Lisbon,to pay for it.
In return, I figned the instrument of fale in the
form which they fent from Lisbon,and fent it to my
old man, who fent me the bills of exchange for
32,800 pieces of eight for the estate; referving the
payment of 100 moidores a year, to him, (the old
man,) during his life, and 50 moidores afterwards
to his fon for his life, which I had promifed them;
and which the plantation was to make good as a rent
charge. And thus I have given the firft part of a
life of fortune and adventure, a life of Providence's
chequer-work, and of a variety which the world will
feldom be able to fhew the like of: beginning foolifh-
ly, but clofing much more happily than any part of
it ever gave me leave fo much as to hope for.
Any one would think, that in this state of com-
plicated good fortune, I was past running any more
hazards, and fo indeed I had been, if other circum-
ftances had concurred : but I was inured to a wander-
ing life, had no family, nor many relations; nor,
however rich, had I contracted much acquaintance;
and though I had fold my estate in the Brafits, yet
I could not keep that country out of my head, and
had a great mind to be upon the wing again J
i efpecially
efpecially I could not refift the strong inclination I
had to fee my ifland, and to know if the poor
Spaniards were in being there; and how the rogues
I left there had ufed them.
My true friend the widow earneftly dissuaded me
from it, and fo far prevailed with me, that almoft
for feven years me prevented my running abroad;
during which time I took my two nephews, the chil-
dren of one of my brothers, into my care: the eldest having fomething of his own, I bred up as a gentle-
man, and gave him a fettlement of fome addition
to his estate, after my deceafe; the other I put out
to a captain of a ship ; and after five years, finding
him a fenfible, bold, enterprifing young fellow, I
put him into a good fhip, and fent him to fea: and
this young fellow afterwards drew me in, as old as I
was, to farther adventures myfelf.
In the mean time, I in part fettled myfelf here:
for, firft of all I married, and that not either to my
difadvantage or diffatisfaclion; and had three chil-
dren, two fons and one daughter: but my wife dying,
and my nephew coming home with good fuccefs from
a voyage to Spain, my inclination to go abroad, and
his importunity, prevailed, and engaged me to go
in his fhip as a private trader to the East-Indies. This
was in the year 1694.
In this voyage I vifited my new colony in the
ifland, faw my fuccefTors the Spaniards, had the
whole ftory of their lives, and of the villains I left
there; how at firft they infulted the poor Spaniards,
how they afterwards agreed, difagreed, united, fepa-
rated, and how at laft the Spaniards were obliged to
life violence with them; how they were subjected to
C c 2 the
the Spaniards; how honestly the Spaniards ufed them;
an hiftory, if it were entered into, as full of variety
and wonderful accidents as my own part; particu-
larly alfo as to their battles with the Caribbeans, who
landed feveral times upon the ifland, and as to the
improvement they made upon the ifland itfelf; and
how five of them made an attempt upon the main
land, and brought away eleven men and five women
prifoners; by which, at my coming, I found about
twenty young children on the ifland.
Here I stayed about twenty days; left them fupplies
of all necessary things, and particularly of arms,
powder, fhot, clothes, tools, and two workmen,
which I brought from England with me; viz. a
carpenter and a smith. Befides this, I shared the land into parts with
them, referved to myfelf the property of the whole,
but gave them such parts, refpeclively, as they agreed
on; and, having fettled all things with them, and
engaged them not to leave the place, I left them
there.
From thence I touched at the Brafils, from whence
I fent a bark, which I bought there, with more peo-
ple, to the ifland; and in it, befides other fupplies,
I fent feven women, being fuch as I found proper
for fervice, or for wives to fuch as would take them.
As to the EngliJJjmen, I promifed them to fend them
fome women from England, with a good cargo of necef-
faries, if they would apply themfelves to planting;
which I afterwards could not perform: the fellows
proved very honeft and diligent, after they were
mastered, and had their properties fet apart for them.
I fent them alfo from the Brafil s five cows, three of
4 them
them being big with calf, fome fheep, and fome hogs,
which, when I came again, were confiderably is creafed.
But all thefe things, with an account how 300
Caribbees came and invaded them, and ruined their
plantations, and how they fought with that whole
number twice, and were at first defeated and one of
them killed; but at laft a ftorm deflroying their ene-
mie's canoes, they famished or destroyed almost all
the reft, and renewed and recovered the pofieffion.
of their plantation, and ftill lived upon the ifland.
All thefe things, with fome very furprifmg inci-
dents in fome new adventures of my own, for ten
years more, I may, perhaps, give a farther account
of hereafter.
